HEADLINE: Despite Taliban Vow, Afghan Opium Production Is Up, U.N. Says

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
The Muslim fundamentalist Taliban movement has pledged to crack down on opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, but opium production there has jumped by 25 percent over the last year, with almost all of the increase occurring in Taliban-controlled areas, United Nations International Drug Control Program officials said Wednesday.
The United Nations agency's 1997 survey, scheduled for release Thursday, estimates that Afghan opium production rose to about 2,800 metric tons this year from 2,300 metric tons in 1996. United Nations officials report that Afghanistan now produces the raw ingredient for nearly half of the world's heroin. 
 Last year, Afghanistan ranked second to Myanmar, which produced 2,500 metric tons of opium, according to a State Department estimate.
Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the United Nations International Drug Control Program, said the increase could mean more heroin flowing into Europe at cheaper prices. European heroin users consume about 80 percent of the heroin refined from opium grown in Afghanistan. Part of the remainder reaches the American market, which is dominated by heroin from Colombia and Southeast Asia.
Mr. Arlacchi said he would raise his concern about the output of Afghan opium at meetings with other United Nations officials in New York today and on Friday.
"I want to inform them because we are very worried about the increase," Mr. Arlacchi said in a telephone interview from Vienna.
A United States counterdrug official in Washington expressed no surprise at the United Nations estimate of Afghanistan's opium crop. "Production has skyrocketed, we know that, and production is sanctioned by the Taliban," the official said.
Officials say the Taliban, which has seized power in 22 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, now controls 96 percent of its poppy-growing areas.
The increase resulted from higher poppy yields, which were attributed to favorable weather, improved cultivation techniques and the shifting of some farmland to poppy cultivation. The total number of acres under poppy cultivation increased by only 2.8 percent, the survey estimated. United Nations survey teams based their estimate on visits to 18 provinces.
The report offered fresh evidence that the Taliban has not fulfilled its promises to crack down on opium production. Taliban officials say they cannot stop peasants from growing opium poppies without other crops to substitute, and contend that persuading them to switch depends on economic assistance from the international community.
The United States and many other countries have kept the Taliban at arm's length because of its violent rise to power and repressive policies like the relegation of women to inferior status. But international officials and journalists traveling in Afghanistan reported that the Taliban is not just tolerating opium production but also taxing it for desperately needed revenue and that Taliban militiamen have been seen guarding opium warehouses and helping transport the crop.
Taliban officials, while denying any involvement in the opium trade, concede that it is flourishing.
Afghanistan is one of six countries identified by the State Department as not cooperating sufficiently in the international fight against illegal drugs. The other countries are Colombia, Iran, Myanmar, Nigeria and Syria. The State Department report said, "While the Taliban banned opium production in late 1996, it made no effort to enforce this ban."

HEADLINE: Exxon Valdez Money to Aid City Wetlands

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
In March of 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil into the pristine waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound, causing one of the worst environmental disasters in history.
Yesterday in Central Park, New York City received some of the money that the Exxon Corporation paid to settle a lawsuit stemming from the spill. The money is to be used to help clean marshes and wetlands in the city. 
 To settle the suit, filed by Alaska and the Federal Government -- in addition to the $2 billion the company paid for direct cleanup costs -- Exxon agreed to pay $900 million to be used for environmental good works around the nation.
Most of the money went to environmental projects in Alaska and the Florida Everglades, but $4.5 million was earmarked for smaller state and city projects that were chosen after a competition run by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.
New York City was awarded $150,000, which the E.P.A. said was the largest award given so far as a result of the competition.
The Parks Department will use the money to plant trees, shrubs and herbs along hillsides lining streams and marshes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens in a campaign to reduce harmful runoffs into the waterways.
The plants, including blueberry, azalea and bayberry root, will stabilize the soil, making it more difficult for harmful pollutants to filter through. The process is intended both to clean up existing pollution and prevent more.
"The Exxon Valdez disaster, with its images of oiled birds and devastated landscapes, drove home in mind-boggling magnitude the importance of preventing pollution before it occurs," said Jeanne M. Fox, a regional administrator for E.P.A., as she presented a giant facsimile of the check.
The local work will be done by the Parks Department's Natural Resources Group, which was founded in 1984 and has won numerous awards for restoring damaged environments. One of the group's continuing projects involves restoring more than a mile of shoreline damaged by oil spills in the Arthur Kill. This is also being financed by Exxon as a result of a 1990 spill in the Arthur Kill, between Staten Island and New Jersey.
The resources group has added 1,000 acres of natural lands to the city park system in the last four years and has established breeding sites for peregrine falcons. New York City is believed to be the nation's largest urban breeding place for the birds.
The latest project will use the settlement money to work on the edges of marshes in the Riverdale and Bronx Parks in the Bronx, Marine Park and Four Sparrow Marshes in Brooklyn and the Alley Pond Park watershed in Queens. Two full-time workers will be hired, and they will be assisted by volunteers.
"Soil stabilization is the key to protecting both the city's terrestrial and aquatic resources, thereby promoting a productive economy," said Marc A. Matsil, chief of the resources group. "The re-established native communities are capable of self-repair."
Yesterday's ceremony during which the city received the money was held at the Harlem Meer in Central Park, a bucolic lake created from a stagnant pond in a major restoration project several years ago. Dignitaries planted a great bulrush plant with a gold shovel along the shore.
The Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, said he only reluctantly agreed not to plant a hazelwood tree, a wry reminder of Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the ill-fated Exxon Valdez. Instead, hazelnut-flavored coffee was served along with goldfish crackers. "The crackers are in memory of the victims," Mr. Stern said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks to Make Trade Deals Congress Can't Amend

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton began a tough struggle today with the nation's labor unions and much of his own party in Congress over his authority to negotiate new trade deals that he declared are "absolutely critical for our world leadership."
Arguing for authority to make trade deals that Congress can accept or reject but not amend, Mr. Clinton portrayed the stakes as far more than a dispute about job losses or the effect of trade on the environment. He said that without the ability to negotiate such accords, he would be crippled in conducting foreign policy. 
 "This is about more than economics," Mr. Clinton told a gathering of 100 executives of small and large businesses who are heavily dependent on export markets, and were invited to the East Room today to cheer on the President's efforts. "It's about whether other countries will continue to look to the United States to lead to a future of peace and freedom and prosperity."
Asserting economic links now form the core of relations with most nations, he argued that renewal of his negotiating authority was "about whether our economic ties will lead to cultural ties and ties of partnership, or whether we will be viewed as somehow withdrawn from the world, not interested in leading it, and therefore not nearly as influential as we might otherwise be for the causes in which we so deeply believe."
But even as he argued that far more than economic pragmatism is at stake, Mr. Clinton's advisers struggled over how to word trade legislation to assure majority votes in both Houses.
The drafting process is bogged down because it must navigate the huge divisions among unions and environmentalists, Democrats suspicious that free-trade accords cost jobs at home, and Republicans whose votes Mr. Clinton desperately needs. So the President found himself today in the embarrassing position of advocating passage of a bill that does not yet exist, and whose main provisions are still cloaked in secrecy.
"We wait for language," Representative Philip Crane, chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. "We've been waiting two years for language," he said, a reference to the Administration's decision to drop the effort to get new trade authority during last year's Presidential election.
The debate over granting Mr. Clinton what is called fast-track authority -- the authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress must approve or reject as is -- mirrors the arguments four years ago over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Labor unions, which staged protests in front of the White House today, are insisting that accords include provisions that would for example set minimum wages in foreign countries or force those nations to cut industrial emissions. Such restrictions, they argue, are the only way to assure that American jobs are not threatened by countries that pay their workers less or attract American investment because they have looser environmental rules.
Mr. Clinton knows what he wants: A "fast track" bill that appears to recognize environmental and labor goals but does not require their inclusion in specific accords.
But Republicans have already said they will not go along with any wording that sets labor and environment restrictions that are not directly "trade related," a phrase the Administration adopted several years ago but declines to define. The Republicans fear that once negotiations start down that road, trade agreements will necessarily include changes in American labor and environmental regulations, as well.
One of the oddities of the debate is that it comes at a time of extraordinary prosperity, much of it based on growing American exports. That means the United States is in an unusually advantageous position to negotiate new accords.
And today Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, listed the global talks that will begin soon under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. They range from the rules that govern procurements by governments, a $1 trillion market over the next decade in Asia alone, to the regulations surrounding financial services and telecommunications.
But the accord that has attracted the most concern in Congress is the extension of Nafta to include Chile, probably the most advanced economy in Latin America. While Chile's inclusion is not itself controversial, it sets a precedent for allowing other nations into the accord. The Administration, however, is insisting that the new talks have little in common with the free-trade agreement -- an accord tinged with drug and immigration problems with Mexico -- and today Mr. Clinton very deliberately never even mentioned it.
But in Congress, the agreement is being argued about constantly, and the "fast track" debate has become something of a review of the free-trade pact's successes and failures. Mr. Clinton's political problem is that it is far easier to identify jobs lost because of changes in the global economy -- a textile factory that closes in South Carolina, for example, and moves to Mexico -- than it is to identify jobs created by the growth in exports.
Politically, though, the fast-track legislation is a bigger problem for Vice President Al Gore, who also spoke quite forcefully today in favor of granting Mr. Clinton the authority he seeks. One reason the White House has failed to release a draft of the legislation is that Mr. Gore's aides are arguing for language that would address many of the concerns of the unions, whose support Mr. Gore needs for his run for President in 2000. One of his likely opponents for the Democratic nomination, Representative Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, has joined with the unions in opposing the fast-track concept, and will spend the week campaigning against the measure even though, like others, he does not know exactly what it says.
Mr. Clinton's aides, in contrast, would rather adopt something closer to the Republican language and offer labor vague promises, including pressing for better labor conditions through international organizations like the International Monetary Fund or the International Labor Organization.
"The problem with this is that we guarantee nothing other than to talk about these issues," an Administration official said recently.
Some union leaders made clear that they hope to replay the free-trade-pact debate of four years ago. Stephen P. Yokich, president of the 800,000 United Automobile Workers, strongly criticized President Clinton today for even suggesting that the free-trade pact might be expanded.
"We don't want Nafta," he said. "It has been a failure."
He said his union would not even endorse trade accords that included stringent protections for workers' rights and the environment. "I even oppose that because we can't even enforce labor rights here in this country," he said.
As a matter of international diplomacy, it is extraordinarily difficult to mandate how other nations treat their workers or regulate industry. Latin American and Asian nations say it is the height of arrogance for Washington to dictate their economic and social policies, noting that the United States would not allow a similar infringement of its policies.
"It's amazing what your Congress debates," an ambassador from Southeast Asia said today. "Supposing Thailand wanted to mandate the minimum wage in the United States. What do you think Americans would say?"

HEADLINE: As Rules on Welfare Tighten, Its Recipients Gain in Stature

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Welfare recipients, last year's political pariahs, are shedding their outcast status.
Not long ago, a woman on public aid could have turned to C-Span and heard a Congressman likening her to alligators or wolves, or the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, warning that she posed a threat to American civilization. 
 Now on WSFA, the NBC affiliate in Montgomery, Ala., she can find a weekly feature portraying a welfare family in favorable terms. "Dump the stereotypes," the correspondent says. On St. Louis radio, she can find an advertising campaign lauding those with the "guts to get off welfare." In Charlotte, N.C., she can see billboards -- paid for by the county and posted by the Chamber of Commerce -- exhorting employers to give recipients a chance.
The mood change goes more than billboard deep. State legislatures, including several in the Deep South, have rejected many of the harshest proposals to emerge under the new state-run systems. Likewise, after cutting immigrant benefits by more than $22 billion last year, Congress hurried back this summer and restored nearly $12 billion.
To be sure, the sweeping Federal legislation passed last year has put more restrictions than ever on welfare benefits, and the aura of good will could quickly fade. It is too soon to tell how many families will prosper in the new era of time limits and work requirements, and how many will sink deeper into poverty. But for the moment at least, the tougher rules coincide with new civic, business and political efforts to recast recipients in a positive light.
"The whole climate in talking about welfare recipients has changed, from negative to positive," said Ron Kaufman, a Republican political strategist who is advising the Welfare to Work Partnership, a nonprofit group that encourages businesses to hire people on public assistance. "Everyone's on their best behavior politically, if you will."
The reappraisal has multiple roots. With caseloads crashing, much of the news coverage has suddenly turned to welfare successes. With labor markets tight, businesses are being forced to give recipients a second look. With tax revenues up, legislatures can afford more generosity. And with the most divisive questions settled by last year's law, many legislators have found themselves guided less by ideology than by a new, nuts-and-bolts practicality.
Consider the journey of Mike Coffman, a Republican State Senator in Colorado and an author of that state's welfare law. When he started working on welfare issues three years ago, Mr. Coffman said, he began with "a primitive approach" that focused on cutting spending and punishing bad behavior.
But this year, as the state began imposing a five-year time limit on cash benefits, Mr. Coffman joined the push for support services, including child care, health care and cash supplements for those seeking training or education.
"When I was outside the system, it was very easy to be ideological and have simplistic solutions," he said. "As I began to learn more, I began to see welfare recipients as victims of bad government policy. I developed a degree of sympathy for them."
Not everyone is impressed.
Peter Edelman, a former welfare official who resigned from the Clinton Administration last year to protest the new law, warned that the mood could quickly sour should the economy do so.
"It would be embarrassing to legislators to be mean and nasty and cut the money when we're rolling in dough," Mr. Edelman said. "If the unemployment rate in Charlotte was 8.2 percent instead of 3.2 percent, you wouldn't have the Chamber of Commerce running around telling businesses to hire people on welfare."
"I really dislike the hype that says everything is wonderful," he added. "The heavy lifting hasn't started."
In signing the welfare law last summer, President Clinton expressed a hope for civic efforts like those now taking place.
"Welfare's no longer a political football to be kicked around," Mr. Clinton said. "It's a personal responsibility of every American who ever criticized the welfare system to help the poor."
But even he might have had a hard time predicting that President George Bush's political director (Mr. Kaufman), President Ronald Reagan's pollster (Richard Wirthlin), and a host of corporate executives would come together in an effort to erase the stigma of being on welfare.
The effort is being coordinated by the Welfare to Work Partnership, which was established this spring with Mr. Clinton's encouragement. Among its tools is an advertising campaign, scheduled this fall for radio, television, and print.
"Welfare mothers are irresponsible," states the underlying text of one of the print advertisements. But the line has been rewritten to read: "Welfare mothers make responsible employees." The same goes for "welfare is a program that creates dependence." It becomes, "welfare to work is a program that creates independence."
The advertisements were designed without charge by Ammirati Puris Lintas, a blue-chip firm more accustomed to selling BMW's than the talents of the poor.
"We're trying to present the stereotype and smash it at the same time," said Duncan Pollock, the chairman of the firm's office in New York. "If there are latent feelings, we felt that to be effective we had to bring them to the surface -- get them on the table and deal with them."
The campaign was tested in St. Louis in August, in coordination with a visit by President Clinton to promote the hiring of people on welfare. Before the campaign, 43 percent of those business leaders who expressed an interest in hiring recipients said they considered them "a good source of employees."
After the campaign, which consisted of a modest number of print and radio advertisements, that figure rose to 52 percent.
"A focused effort can change the underlying perceptions," said Maury Giles, a researcher at Wirthlin Worldwide, which collected the data.
But the numbers also underscore the challenge that remains. Another way of reading the data is that even among employers who expressed an interest in hiring recipients, about half doubted their abilities.
In Charlotte, the Chamber of Commerce began an advertising campaign last year with an $84,000 contract from the county department of social services. The president of the agency that designed it, Pam Boileau, was once on welfare herself.
"There's such a stigma around welfare recipients," Ms. Boileau said. "Each one of us has to accept the responsibility of helping recipients get off the rolls."
 In Montgomery, it is not an advertising agency but a television correspondent, Jennifer Schram, pushing a new look at recipients. Her weekly profile of a welfare family is designed, in part, to help the state recruit mentors to work with those leaving the rolls.
"I show that it could be any of us," Ms. Schram said. "Some unforeseen accident could happen. Where would we turn?"
The flood of optimistic accounts could raise unrealistic expectations. Not all the "myths" about welfare recipients' problems are wrong.
Should progress stall as the nation confronts the tougher cases that remain on the rolls -- people with little education, little work experience or problems with alcohol and drugs -- the conversation could return to the tone set by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. Mr. Gramm ran for President last year in part by demanding that people on welfare "get out of the wagon and help the rest of us pull."
For now, the mood swing has brought results. Perhaps none has been as dramatic as the decision by Congress to reinstate $11.7 billion of welfare benefits for immigrants, just months after contending that the program, Supplemental Security Income, was rife with fraud and abuse.
The move partly reflects an ebbing of budgetary pressure. It also derives from a growing fear of the Hispanic vote. And the concern over last year's cuts may have been stoked by press accounts of several immigrants thought to have committed suicide partly in despair over losing their benefits.
While partially restoring the immigrant cuts, Congress also allotted an additional $3.4 billion for programs to help recipients find work.
"Things have changed substantially since last year," said Ellen Nissenbaum, who follows anti-poverty legislation for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington advocacy group.
State legislatures have also shown more concern about the needy than opponents of the new law predicted.
"What I saw wasn't just sympathy but support -- support in a tangible way," said Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare programs for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 In New York, for instance, the Legislature rejected Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to cut benefits by 45 percent over four years. In California, the Legislature blocked a proposal by Gov. Pete Wilson to enforce time limits as short as one year. Both legislatures also rejected the Governors' proposal to abolish general assistance programs, which provide cash payments to single adults.
To some extent, the fights merely reflect party divisions. Both Governors are Republicans, and three of the four legislative bodies in those states are controlled by Democrats. But there were other forces at play, including a fear of county officials from both parties that a withdrawal of state aid would leave them awash in needy people.
"Our views on these matters are not philosophical or political," wrote a group of Republican county officials in New York, in an April letter opposing various aspects of Mr. Pataki's plan. "Rather they concern the fiscal and practical impact that the choices made in Albany will have on local governments."
In Arkansas, Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, proposed a two-year limit with few services or exemptions. But the Democratic-controlled Legislature created exemptions for recipients with "extraordinary barriers." And it postponed the start of time limits until next summer, to give the state time to put other support services in place.
Similarly, the Alabama Legislature moved to soften a proposal by Gov. Fob James Jr., a Republican. Though both Houses are controlled by Democrats, some of the work was led by a Republican, Representative Jim Carns. He pushed for earnings supplements for recipients who find jobs and child care for teen-aged mothers.
"I had the typical knee-jerk reaction before I got into this," Mr. Carns said. "I thought it'd be easier to save money."
His work drew praise from State Senator Rodger Mell Smitherman, a Democrat who serves as chairman of the Senate Black Caucus.
"There's a realization that it's one thing to say you want people to work, but it's another to create the environment for them to do that," Mr. Smitherman said. "I was pleased to see that it wasn't all harsh."
The compromise fashioned by Mr. Smitherman and Mr. Carns even contained an increase in benefit levels, the only one in the country. But the two were shocked when the bill was defeated by a last-minute filibuster: with Alabama ranked almost last in benefits, a few legislators decided that the grant increase, from $164 a month to $185, was not enough.

HEADLINE: Arafat Must Take Greater Steps To Halt Terrorism, Albright Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright made a public show of support today for Israel and for Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism and accused the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, of not doing nearly enough to crack down on the support network for the terrorists.
In a hospital visit to speak to Israelis wounded in the last two suicide bombings, in a tour of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and in her public statements, Ms. Albright used the first day of her first official trip to the Middle East to underline America's close relationship with Israel, its security and its people. 
 "I will be seeing Chairman Arafat tomorrow, and my message will be clear," Ms. Albright said at a news conference alongside the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. "It is essential that Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation be serious, sustained and effective.
"At the same time, the Palestinian Authority must take unilateral steps and actions to root out the terrorist infrastructure. If we are to create and sustain an invigorated and accelerated negotiating process, there is simply no other way."
Senior American officials said they agreed with Mr. Netanyahu that Mr. Arafat "is not doing nearly enough" to crack down on radical Palestinian groups like Hamas and Islamic Holy War despite a series of arrests in the last few days.
They said they based that judgment on the evidence provided by an American intelligence officer who sits with the Israeli and Palestinian security chiefs when they meet.
But in private talks with Mr. Netanyahu, Ms. Albright warned him that putting too much pressure on Mr. Arafat would deprive the Palestinian of any political leeway and could force him to defy the Israelis.
In another private discussion, the Israeli President, Ezer Weizman, urged her to be firm with Mr. Netanyahu, a move that drew criticism from Israelis when the conversation was disclosed.
But Ms. Albright is a firm believer in public diplomacy, and it was her public stand that drew immediate cries of bias from Palestinians.
A senior Palestinian official, Hanan Ashrawi, was sharply critical of the way Ms. Albright had begun her one-week visit to the region, saying she had displayed "a wholeheartedly one-sided approach."
Speaking in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Ms. Ashrawi said, "At some point the United States has to decide whether it wants to serve only Israeli interests or whether it wants to serve the interests of peace in the region."
On the other hand, Mr. Arafat had been eager for Ms. Albright to visit the region, as he can use her diplomacy to his advantage. If he decides, for example, that he must respond to pressure for a firmer crackdown, he could present it as a response to the Americans.
Senior American officials rejected Ms. Ashrawi's complaint. They repeated Ms. Albright's assertion that "security is the sine qua non" for progress in restoring genuine mutual confidence and real peace talks, and they said the American strategy had been drawn up with the interests of all parties in mind.
In her public comments, they noted, Ms. Albright insisted on the preservation of the Oslo accords and the need for both sides to keep commitments, including two further Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank, which aides to Mr. Netanyahu say Israel would prefer to skip.
She told the Prime Minister to refrain from "unilateral actions" that would pre-empt peace talks.
"Clearly Israel also has a responsibility to shape an environment which will give that process a chance to succeed," Ms. Albright said at the news conference with Mr. Netanyahu. "This means that Israel should be taking steps that build confidence and refrain from actions that undermine confidence and trust."
But she was much harsher and more specific in her comments about Mr. Arafat's need to be convincing on his promises of security cooperation, and American officials said the tack was deliberate.
The officials acknowledged that establishing Israeli confidence about Palestinian security commitments would take some time, and that any serious discussion of political issues -- like peace talks on a final settlement between the two sides -- was many weeks away.
Mr. Arafat, they said, will have to choose between preserving Palestinian unity and making progress in peace negotiations, they said.
"Unless he moves hard against the enemies of peace, who are also his own enemies, there can be no peace process," an American official said.
But in their closed session, American officials said, Ms. Albright also told Mr. Netanyahu that Mr. Arafat needed "more political space" in which to carry out a sustained crackdown on terrorism.
She said Mr. Netanyahu should move quickly to respond to early steps by Mr. Arafat with an easing of the economic pressure that Israel has put on the Palestinian Authority.
The United States has criticized Mr. Netanyahu for holding back tax revenue that Israel owes the Authority, and Ms. Albright asked him to consider "how the long-term fight against terrorism could occur in an environment where Arafat's political space and funds are tightened."
A senior Israeli official said Mr. Netanyahu and Ms. Albright had discussed a list of Israeli actions, which the official did not describe, that could reciprocate Palestinian steps on terrorism. But he emphasized that Mr. Arafat would have to move first, and convincingly.
Having conducted a series of arrests in Gaza this week, the Palestinian Authority moved today to shut down the Islamic Bloc Youth Union there. The organization represents thousands of students and is identified with Hamas.
But Mr. Netanyahu dismissed such moves as the arrests of "sardines, not sharks."
For her part, "Albright thinks a lot more needs to be done by Arafat," an American official said. "She will say to him, 'What more do you need to know that these people are destroying your chance of making peace?' "
At breakfast with President Weizman, Ms. Albright was urged to "be ready to put pressure on Netanyahu" and "bang some heads together, not now necessarily, but later," an American official said. Mr. Weizman, a former Defense Minister, also criticized Mr. Netanyahu's humiliating treatment of Mr. Arafat and said that it was "dangerous to have hungry neighbors," the official said.
Disclosure of that conversation set off a furor among Israeli politicians, some of whom accused Mr. Weizman of privately departing from the political neutrality he is supposed to keep as President. Ms. Albright was visibly moved by her conversations with victims of the suicide bombings at Hadassah University Hospital-Mt. Scopus.
She thanked the 11 patients, most of whom suffered burns and shrapnel wounds, for letting her have what she called "a chance to see real people with tremendous injuries" and added, "I will carry this in my heart."
Daniel Williams, 19, a young seminary student from Miami, was in Israel for only 23 hours before the Sept. 4 bombing but intends to stay. He gave Ms. Albright a letter urging her to be tough on Mr. Arafat and urged her to remember the victims "when you go to embrace Arafat."
Appearing a little annoyed, the Secretary said, "I don't intend to embrace Arafat."
Ruth Sultan, 20, suffers from severe burns and thanked Ms. Albright for coming to meet her and her mother. "I hope her visit will help," Ms. Sultan said, "but I know and feel that those things will happen again and again. I will go on. We don't have a choice; this is our country."

HEADLINE: Accord Ends Con Edison's Monopoly and Cuts Rates by 10%

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Facing criticism that an early version of a proposed rate reduction favored large businesses, Consolidated Edison and state regulators agreed yesterday to an across-the-board 10 percent cut in electric rates, the largest rollback in half a century.
The agreement, approved yesterday by the state Public Service Commission, is part of a deal that will drastically reshape the power industry in New York. Besides cutting rates, it will break up Con Edison into several pieces and open the door to competition among power companies in a market that Con Edison has held for decades as a monopoly. The commission intends to do the same with each of the state's seven regional electric monopolies, hoping that competition will lower New York's electric rates, which are among the highest in the nation. 
 The first version of the state agreement with Con Edison, released in March, would have cut residential and small business rates by 3.3 percent over five years, and large business rates by 10 percent over five years, while giving an immediate 25 percent cut to a handful of large industrial customers. After consumer groups and elected officials, including state Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, protested loudly that the plan did not do enough for ordinary customers, the commission began renegotiating the deal.
With some behind-the-scenes prodding from Gov. George E. Pataki, who appointed them, the commissioners insisted that small users be guaranteed the same 10 percent reduction as large customers, and Con Edison agreed. For the average residential customer, the savings will be about $5 a month when the plan is fully in effect, five years from now.
"The agreement will save New York City and Westchester County consumers over a billion and a half dollars over the next five years," said John F. O'Mara, the commission chairman.
In sheer dollars, it is by far the largest rate reduction ever by a New York utility, commission officials said. It is the first reduction for Con Edison customers since a 3 percent cut in 1987, and based on percentage, it is the largest decline in the utility's rates since 1948.
But consumer advocates remained largely dissatisfied, arguing that the utility's stockholders should have been forced to absorb a large chunk of the company's outstanding obligations on capital investments and high-priced power purchase contracts, which Con Edison estimates at up to $6.2 billion. The agreement allows the company to recover 90 percent to 100 percent of those costs from its customers.
"By making shareholders share the burden, we could double the rate savings," said Travis Plunkett, state legislative representative for the American Association of Retired Persons.
Mr. Pataki also intervened with the commission this week to help salvage a program that requires Con Edison to help its customers reduce their demand for electricity through measures like subsidizing replacement of inefficient appliances and advising businesses on how to cut their consumption. The program's budget has already dropped from $125 million in 1993 to $48 million this year, and the commission had planned to cut it to just $6 million a year. Instead, the program will get $30 million.
Most environmental groups protested that the number was still too low and refused to support the agreement. But Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which helped negotiate the final figure, called it "a floor we can build on."
The New York Public Interest Research Group said that, despite the changes, it opposed the agreement on both consumer and environmental grounds. "The whole thing was stage managed so that the Governor could look like the hero by improving somewhat on a truly terrible deal," said Larry Shapiro, a lawyer at the group.
But the Giuliani administration hailed the result as a victory. "It will provide real relief to residents and small businesses," said Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro.
The immediate 25 percent cut for a few large industrial customers also remains in the agreement.
A last-minute change in the deal will save the city, the Transit Authority and other public agencies a total of $40 million a year by averting an increase in Con Edison's charges for delivering low-cost power from the New York Power Authority.
Joan S. Freilich, senior vice president of Con Edison, said the rate reductions "are going to be a stretch" for the company.
But industry analysts say that the cost of producing power has generally declined in recent years, and that Con Edison will probably be able to sell its power plants for much more than experts anticipated even a year ago. The agreement will require Con Edison to sell at least half of its generating capacity in New York City. The company owns 13 power plants, 9 of them in the city.
Under the plan, Con Edison will split into three separate companies under a single holding company. One will own power plants and compete on the wholesale level with other generators. A second will be a power retailer, buying power from wholesalers and competing with other retailers for customers' business, much like the long-distance telephone companies.
The third company will maintain monopoly ownership of the wires that link customers to the state's power grid, and will charge competing retailers for the use of the network.
Critics of the plan, including out-of-state power companies that want to break into the New York market and many business groups whose members hope to benefit from the lower rates competition promises, say that it shields Con Edison from most real competition by allowing the utility to charge high rates for delivering a competitor's power.
As states around the country move toward dismantling electric monopolies and introducing competition, few have as much incentive as New York, where high rates are often said to drive away businesses.
Con Edison's rates are about double the national average, and are the second-highest in the continental United States, after the Long Island Lighting Company's.

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE VOTERS -- On Their Home Turf, a Wide Gulf in Enthusiasm for Two Candidates;
In Messinger Land, Talk of Apathy And Its Aftermath

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Imagine a diehard Ruth W. Messinger voter, and Fred Kramer may come to mind. A novelist and a longtime resident of the Upper West Side, Ms. Messinger's home turf, he carries books in the pocket of a rumpled blue suit stained with red sauce.
"I like her politics," Mr. Kramer said matter-of-factly while walking up Broadway, the city's central avenue for traditional American liberalism. But like so many in his party, Mr. Kramer broke with expected political behavior this week. He voted for Sal F. Albanese, the Brooklyn Councilman, because he supports the death penalty. 
 Mr. Kramer says he has not decided how he will vote in the runoff between Ms. Messinger and the Rev. Al Sharpton, and he said, "I have not closed the door on Giuliani, because I like what he's done on crime."
The day after Ms. Messinger failed to win 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote, few Democrats interviewed in an area that is her traditional base expressed much passion or commitment for her. The people who seemed to express the most enthusiasm for her are New Yorkers in low-income areas, including some who voted for Mr. Sharpton.
Many middle-class Democratic voters said they were reasonably happy with the way the city is being governed, which could go a long way toward explaining why only 18 percent of the registered Democrats voted in the primary. A large number of people expressed apathy about the primary, saying the outcome in November was already assured.
"I did not vote and I am ashamed," said Gladys Foxe, a 56-year-old psychotherapist who lives on West 74th Street. "I had that thought in the back of my mind that Giuliani will win a second term."
She added that she planned to vote in the runoff on Sept. 23, but that she had not yet made up her mind.
"Al Sharpton represents voices who are too rarely heard, but there are aspects of his politics I don't agree with," Ms. Foxe said. "Ruth Messinger is a kind of Democrat and a woman whom I would feel more familiar with, but I don't like to automatically vote for just what is familiar."
Some Democrats said that Ms. Messinger's disputed commercial about school crowding had backfired. School officials condemned the advertisement -- a staged scene that showed a class crammed into a bathroom -- as misleading and unfair. Others said Ms. Messinger had failed to express clear views on the issues they thought were Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's weak points, namely jobs and police brutality.
"Things are good in New York, and it is hard to run against that," said Susan Gutterman, a 60-year-old homemaker on West 95th Street who said she nevertheless had planned to vote for Ms. Messinger until she saw the bathroom ad.
Claudia Fernandez, 21, a Barnard College administrative assistant who voted for Ms. Messinger on Tuesday, said, "Ruth is a worthy challenger, and I really want her opinions heard, especially on education." But she added, "I'll probably vote for Giuliani in the general election."
While responses to Ms. Messinger were largely tepid on the Upper West Side, interviews showed that she was more popular with factory workers in the East Williamsburg Industrial Park in Brooklyn, who expressed much concern about the city economy and job security.
"I like Ruth," said Frank Jenkins, a 39-year-old plumbing company handyman and resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Mr. Jenkins said that he hat not voted on Tuesday because he thought Ms. Messinger was a sure winner, but that he definitely would vote for her in November. "She can't do worse than Giuliani, laying off people with budget cuts," Mr. Jenkins said.
"I think she has a chance," said Peter Perez, a 23-year-old forklift operator who lives on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. "I don't think Giuliani is very popular."
Interviews in middle-class neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn suggested that if Ms. Messinger survives the runoff, she has her work cut out in trying to retrieve an important bloc of voters from Mr. Giuliani's camp.
"Outer-borough voters see Ruth Messinger as the Manhattan Borough President who will think of Manhattan first," said Chris Ahl, 46, a Staten Island telephone repairman sitting in his truck on Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst.
During a political discussion in the Amaf Supply appliance store in Flushing, a number of customers and employees expressed the feeling that they did not really know what Ms. Messinger stands for. Joseph Tarantini, 30, a firefighter, said he would have voted for Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi had he run for mayor, but he did not think Ms. Messinger was strong enough to do the job. "As a city resident, I can't argue with what Giuliani has done," he added.
Alfonso Velasquez, 43, a salesman, said: "I'm a registered Democrat, but I don't think she can beat Giuliani. I won't vote for him, though."
A second salesman interrupted him. "Why not?" he said. "Crime is way down."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leaders Back Bill on Religious Persecution

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
A coalition of religious groups led by evangelical Christians today won critical support from the Republican leadership in its effort to mandate economic sanctions against any country engaged in religious persecution.
The endorsement of the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Speaker Newt Gingrich gives the bill enough momentum to create a quandary for the White House and its business allies who already complain that American trade is too encumbered. 
 Beyond the foreign policy implications, support for the measure provides further evidence of the emerging political clout of conservative Christian groups in an area of foreign policy that has been the exclusive preserve of human rights groups like Amnesty International.
The bill backed by the coalition would create a new office within the White House to monitor the treatment of religious minorities around the world. It would also require economic sanctions against nations that abuse their citizens on the basis of religion. And it would give those fleeing religious persecution priority over other refugees in gaining entry into the United States.
Even though the Clinton Administration opposes the bill in its current form, it is likely to pass, although with some amendments.
"This is one of the top priorities of this Republican Congress," Mr. Gingrich said today as he met with more than 30 leaders of religious organizations, which, with a few exceptions, represented Christianity's fundamentalist and evangelical denominations. Among the leaders was Cheryl Halpern, national chairwoman of the National Jewish Coalition.
State Department officials have objected that the bill is a blunderbuss approach that removes their flexibility in combating religious persecution around the world. They also complain that while the sanctions in the bill are relatively modest, their imposition could harm American relations with key allies like Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
"The Administration strongly supports the objectives of eliminating religious persecution," John Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, said Tuesday in testimony before the House International Relations Committee. "But we believe the current draft in the legislation would frustrate that goal."
Administration officials say privately, however, they would be willing to discuss possible alternatives, including more monitoring of religious harassment, increased reports to publicize the practice in countries like the Sudan, Iran, China, Egypt and Indonesia, and insuring that current human right laws explicitly cover repression of religious minorities.
In the past year, using denominational newsletters and broadcasts on Christian radio and television stations, groups like the National Association of Evangelicals, the Southern Baptist Convention and the Family Research Council have quietly built up a powerful grass-roots constituency that has pressured the Clinton Administration and Congress into taking a number of steps.
Last year, the groups pressured the White House to agree to set up a committee to recommend ways to fight religious persecution around the world. This summer, the State Department issued a report on the harassment of religious minorities, with an emphasis on persecution of Christians. The groups also steered the debate over the trading status of China to include that country's persecution of Christians. And now the religious persecution bill has picked up the endorsement of the leaders of both Houses of Congress.
Leaders of the movement say their efforts are revitalizing what had become a moribund rights movement.
"With the dismantling of the Soviet Union, the end of apartheid in South Africa and the democratization of South America, the human rights movement here fell apart at the grass-roots level," said Nina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom of Freedom House, which has been working with evangelical Christians. "This is a new lobby that is emerging."
Last month, these evangelical groups were joined by the Chrisitan Coalition, which declared that ending religious persecution around the world was their "top legislative priority."
The new human rights group is being greeted with both enthusiasm and wariness by traditional liberal human rights groups and mainstream religious organizatons that have normally have been involved in foreign policy matters.
On one hand, the Christian right's political power is welcomed by human rights groups, which are routinely out-muscled by business interests in the debate over using trade sanctions to foster human rights. But some human rights advocates question whether the fundamentalist Christians will argue for people other than persecuted Christians.
Indeed, some leaders of mainstream churches note that the bill backed by the coalition, which is still in draft form, makes no reference to persecution of Jews, and speaks only of harassment of "moderate Muslims" in the Sudan. The plight of Jews in Syria or Muslims in Bosnia is not mentioned.
William Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International, U.S.A., the country's largest grass-roots rights group, with 300,000 members -- far below the 15.6 million-strong Southern Baptist Convention -- expressed the ambivalence some human rights advocates are feeling in a column in his organization's newsletter.
Describing his ideology as "left-wingey," Mr. Schulz said he welcomed the involvement of "those who genuinely care about human suffering, no matter what their views of God or the state." But he also pointedly asked: "Is it right for Christians to limit their outrage to violations against Christians? What about Muslims in China's Xinjing Province or Buddhists in Tibet? What exactly is the motive of political and religious conservatives, and is it pure?"

CORRECTION-DATE: September 13, 1997, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the growing involvement of evangelical Christians in the human rights movement misstated the opinion of William Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. While Mr. Schulz has written that some human rights advocates are wary about the emergence of evangelical Christians in their movement, he has made it clear that he does not share these doubts and welcomes "all political and religious stripes."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Adventure and Loneliness Riding Freights in the 30's

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
The romantic spirit and visual prettiness of "Riding the Rails" are unexpected, since this documentary deals with hard times. But during the Great Depression, as this film by Michael Uys and Lexy Lovell attests, a world of adventure briefly revealed itself to certain daring American teen-agers.
As families struggled for economic survival, the solution to domestic quarrels or restless yearnings might simply be running away on the railroad. 
 According to Thomas Minehan's 1934 book, "Boy and Girl Tramps of America," on which the film is partly based, as many as 250,000 young Americans may have taken this drastic escape route. "I'll write," one of the film's interviewees recalls having said, in a note placed on a pillow before leaving home.
This warmly nostalgic film, which opens today at Cinema Village, is largely based on the reminiscences of those who shared the itinerant experience. (Mr. Uys solicited stories from, among others, the readers of Modern Maturity magazine, and he heard from 3,000 people.) It mixes newsreels, photographs and letters capturing the young travelers with present-day scenes of the elderly telling their tales. In this it recalls "Fire on the Mountain," another documentary (about brave skiers recruited for World War II military service) about the profound effects of youthful adventure. All the men heard here, and one remarkably gutsy woman named Peggy De Hart, sound deeply touched by what they learned and saw.
"Riding the Rails," which will be shown on a bill with William Wellman's 1933 drama "Wild Boys of the Road," a fictional tour of the same terrain, begins with the travelers' optimism.
The lean, fresh faces seen in old group photographs are often so handsome that they resemble current fashion advertisements. "I think it's the last free red-blooded adventure available to today's Americans," says a man known as Guitar Whitey, who still rides freight trains whenever he can.
But the film also describes how some of these young itinerants evolved into hobos, shunned and ostracized in the towns where they would stop. Clarence Lee, a black man who is moved to tears by some of his memories, describes the racial prejudice he also encountered. And the speakers tell of terrible loneliness. There is the image of a young man weeping over the birthday cake his mother sent him from a faraway home.
"For many, it was a brutal education," the film explains, while telling how a young man could load coal for an entire day and find himself paid with two tomatoes. In a documentary that is of course accompanied by the music of Woody Guthrie and other folk greats, there is the growing awareness of wild adolescent freedom coming to an end. "I was young and I felt nothing could defeat me," one man says with simple eloquence. "But some of these men, they were older and you could see that they had become defeated."
"Riding the Rails" conveys the full weight of this knowledge, even as it follows its interviewees to the end of their youthful travels, right up to the bittersweet experience of returning home.

HEADLINE: No Chinese Connection?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Sept. 7 news article on the end of phase one of Senate hearings on campaign finance practices lists Yah Lin Trie, a friend of President Clinton, and members of the Riady family, longtime financial backers of the President, as potential witnesses who are outside the reach of subpoenas. The article states "but these people either have no relationship with the Chinese Government or their connection is so slight that there is little reason to believe that the donations they were involved with came from Beijing."
The hearings, however, established a link between the finances raised by Mr. Trie for the Democratic National Committee and Ng Lap Seng, a Chinese developer, who wired $200,000 from a Bank of China account to an account he shared with Mr. Trie, a business partner. Mr. Ng happens to serve on the "People's Consultative Congress," an organization that provides economic advice to the Beijing Government. Mr. Trie was also responsible for arranging for Wang Jun, China's most important arms dealer, to attend a White House coffee with the President. 
 Members of the Riady family are owners of the Lippo Group, the Indonesian conglomerate that has developed close ties to commerce officials of the Chinese Government, whose investment in Lippo's Hong Kong bank was made shortly after the President's election.
Are these these connections really "so slight that there is little reason to believe" the contributions came from Beijing?

HEADLINE: Sitting in the 70's;
With Outdated Styles, Furniture Sellers Are Struggling

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
By every visible measure, there is no excuse for not making money in the furniture business these days.
New homes have been selling briskly, the number of decorating magazines has risen sharply in recent years and Martha Stewart long ago legitimized obsessive homemaking. 
 But when the Levitz Furniture Corporation, one of the country's largest furniture chains, sought bankruptcy protection last week, it underscored a painful truth: Consumers may be willing to spend money on furniture for their homes, but a lot of retailers are simply not giving them the products they want.
Indeed, furniture sellers and experts agree that while other retailers have scrambled over the last several years to keep up with changing consumer demands, much of the furniture business has lagged hopelessly behind.
As clothing has become more casual and cars more sporty, furniture has remained firmly entrenched in the 1970's, when many suburban middle-class homes had the same basic easy chairs and dinette sets. Moreover, many mainstream retailers have been far more focused on pushing easy credit terms rather than updating the style of their living room and bedroom offerings.
"The furniture business has been changing," said Gerald Birnbach, chief executive of Rowe Furniture, a Levitz supplier now owed $4 million by the retailer. "The large players don't seem to realize it because they are mired in tradition. What stimulates most Americans is their aspirations. They want nice things, and our industry is not exposing them to them."
Taking advantage of the weaknesses among the traditional stores are specialty chains like Crate and Barrel, a unit of Euromarket Designs, and Pier 1 Imports, whose furniture selection, while limited, is trendy and eye-catching.
Levitz, after being stuck in a rut for a decade, was struggling to breathe new life into its business. But it was hobbled by heavy debt, making it that much more difficult to let shoppers know that the company was changing its ways, said Michael Bozic, who became chief executive in late 1995.
Mr. Bozic, a former chief executive of Sears, Roebuck & Company and widely respected in the retail industry, said in an interview this week that he had made up-to-date offerings and a pleasant shopping experience his main goals when he took over. Sales did improve: This spring, for the first time in two years, the company posted back-to-back sales gains at its stores open at least a year, the industry's traditional benchmark. Month to month, though, sales have been wildly inconsistent this year.
And Levitz, based in Boca Raton, Fla., was facing $1 million in weekly interest payments, remnants of a 1985 leveraged buyout that saddled the company with debt and left it with a thin financial cushion that unnerved suppliers.
The final blow, Mr. Bozic said, came when Montgomery Ward filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July, causing suppliers to worry about other weak retailers and cut off shipments. "Suppliers had heightened concerns," he said, "so what they did was very understandable, which was put us under credit restrictions.
"Ironically, we had the biggest three days of business over Labor Day weekend, but we could only deliver half of that."
And Levitz is far from alone, with national chains like Jennifer Convertibles, the Bombay Company and Krause's Furniture suffering declining sales in recent years. Department stores have pulled back sharply from selling furniture. Even Heilig-Meyers, the furniture giant in Richmond with $1.5 billion in annual revenue, said last month that its second-quarter earnings would be lower than expected.
So what plunged the $50 billion furniture industry into such a mess? For one thing, while other retailers consolidated over the last decade, the furniture business remains highly fragmented, with hundreds of local family businesses and only a few true national players.
Experts on the business also say that furniture sellers and manufacturers have not formed the relationships needed to come up with creative products or create strong marketing and public relations campaigns. The marketing is especially key because while shoppers may go to Macy's to buy Tommy Hilfiger shirts, they are hard pressed to identify a brand-name furniture company.
"We haven't done a great job of attracting the consumer," said Kimberley Wray, editorial director of High Points, a trade publication in High Point, N.C. "There is no 'incredible edible egg' campaign for furniture."
Logistical problems also abound. Because furniture is so big, managing inventory is difficult, often forcing shoppers to wait five weeks or more for a couch or a chair. The delivery process poses problems, too. It is hard to maintain a team of people who both know how to assemble furniture and are willing to climb four flights of stairs to do it. And with more two-career couples, there is often no one at home to receive the delivery.
Most important, furniture fashion has struggled to keep up with increasingly sophisticated consumer tastes. Shoppers who have seen the bright colors and casual styles in House & Garden or Martha Stewart Living magazines are hard pressed to find such items at traditional retailers, particularly at a reasonable price.
While the national chains have struggled, retailers like Pottery Barn, a unit of Williams-Sonoma Inc., Crate and Barrel and Pier 1 have rushed to fill the vacuum. They have a simple trick: lure shoppers who have come in for a candle or a set of wine goblets into checking out pillows, couches and beds while in the store. And tables are handsomely laid out with, what else, that store's dishes and flatware.
The furniture offerings at these specialty stores are by no means as deep as the selections at the vast Levitz warehouses. But what the stores do offer is casual, slightly hip styles that are a far cry from leather easy chairs and glass coffee tables.
"Levitz was known for the great big velvet thing that guys love in the den," said Ms. Wray, the High Points editor. "But the consumer wants fashion. She wants to see what she sees on 'Friends.' That is why these life-style retailers like Pottery Barn have done well."
Tanisha Peten, who spent her lunch hour at Crate and Barrel in Manhattan yesterday, said she had turned to that store to furnish her Brooklyn apartment. "Those places like Levitz are too stuffy," she said. "This is more contemporary. It isn't like a place my parents would shop."
Pier 1 has made its name in fairly inexpensive wicker. Crate and Barrel has dining tables that look like antiques. Pottery Barn made a huge splash with inexpensive lamp shades fashioned from beads or in unusual colors like lavender and mint.
"Three years ago, people were more concerned with what color the fabric was," said Mr. Birnbach of Rowe Furniture. "Today, it is, 'Does it feel nice?' Chenilles and those kind of fabrics and bright colors are popular. Things are soft and casual, like the way we are living."
Ethan Allen Interiors is one of the few large furniture retailers that seems to have adjusted to changing tastes. The company, which makes its own furniture, was known since 1932 for its purely American colonial offerings. But over the last six years, Ethan Allen replaced nearly 90 percent of its merchandise, and half of it is now casual.
The company also trained its sales staff and hired interior decorators to help shoppers with decorating ideas. And uniquely, Ethan Allen's management is now 90 percent women, up from almost zero 10 years ago, said Farooq Kathwari, the company's chief executive. "That change was one of the most important we made," he added.
"The sensitivity toward advertising and color was missing," Mr. Kathwari said. A proposed new line of bedroom furniture was rejected recently, he said, because the female managers deemed the pieces too dark and not romantic enough.
The strategy has paid off. For the quarter ended June 30, Ethan Allen reported net income of $14.9 million, or $1.02 a share, up from $7.5 million, or 51 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Shares in the company have risen from about $20 in April to more than $30, adjusted for a split. It closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $33.375, up $1.25.
Ethan Allen aside, furniture may be one of the few areas in retailing where smaller can be better, analysts say, because economies of scale are hard to achieve, and managing a business where the product is cumbersome can be easier on an individual store level.
"Size can be a handicap," said David C. Childe, a retail analyst with Salomon Brothers. "The price differential between buying a couple of sofas and 100,000 sofas is not that great. Also, delivery schedules are hard to manage on a national level."
One relatively new entrant to the market is Rooms to Go, based in Seffner, Fla., and run by the Seaman family, which once owned the chain known best for its perpetual "one-time" sales. Seaman's was recently sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm.
Rooms to Go has 52 stores in 5 Southern states, serving up what are essentially Crate and Barrel knockoffs at a lower price. Customers see complete rooms decorated with contemporary furniture, a far cry from the screaming Seaman's ads that encouraged shoppers to come in and save money on dowdy living room sets jammed into a large showroom.
"Seaman's was a 1980's concept," said Jeffrey Seaman, president of Rooms to Go, which he started with his father in 1991. "Now, customers want simplicity. They want a clean presentation with a lot of clarity."
Can Levitz take a big national company with giant stores and make them work as well? The company has been dogged by cash problems for years. After going public in 1968, it was acquired in a leveraged buyout in 1985, only to go public again in 1993. But rather than pay down debt, it bought a small retailer in the Chicago area for cash and failed to invest in turning the company around. "We didn't make the changes we could have and should have with cost structure and merchandise," Mr. Bozic said.
With protection from creditors and a new mix of merchandise, Levitz may indeed have a new lease on life. But Wall Street will have to be patient, analysts say. "Turning around a furniture retailer is akin to turning around a battleship," Mr. Childe, the analyst, said. "It sometimes takes two years or so to get new customers."
But Ms. Wray and others say they have confidence in Mr. Bozic. "He has done an incredible job with what most people consider an unmanageable situation," she said. "They have been hamstrung by debt and an excess of real estate that didn't make sense, and previous management ran it into the ground. They just need more time."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Wrong Signal

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
If there is one person in the world who best symbolizes human resistance to tyranny, it is the Chinese prisoner Wei Jingsheng. Alone, he has challenged the most powerful tyranny on earth -- and been willing to pay the fearful price it exacted. For advocating democracy in China, he was imprisoned for 14 years and is now serving another 14-year sentence under brutal conditions.
In his courage, Wei Jingsheng speaks for the values of freedom that we Americans assert in the world and aim to protect. But if influential forces in Congress have their way, this country will soon tell the world that he and his cause matter less to us than another concern: religious persecution. 
 That would be the effect of legislation called the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act. Supported by fundamentalist and evangelical Christian denominations, it was endorsed this week by the Republican leaders of the House and Senate and seems headed for passage.
The bill would set up an Office of Religious Persecution Monitoring in the White House, independent of the State Department. Whenever the office's director found religious persecution in a country, regardless of other foreign-policy concerns, economic and other sanctions would automatically come into force against that country.
Anyone claiming to be a victim of religious persecution and seeking asylum in the United States would be given priority in consideration by our immigration authorities. The victims of torture, threatened assassination, female genital mutilation and other horrors would get shorter shrift.
Making religious persecution the paramount concern in our law of human rights would send a signal to other governments that we care less about such things as genocide, political repression and racial persecution. It would also tell the world that we now favor what we in this country have always opposed: the idea of a hierarchy of fundamental rights.
Asian autocrats such as Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, seeking to justify their repression, have advanced the notion of "Asian values." To Asians, they said, a full stomach and an orderly society are more important than freedom of speech and other human rights. The U.S. stand against that destructive proposition would be undercut by a law indicating that some rights are more important to us than others.
The legislation reflects genuine and growing American concern about religious persecution in the world. The Chinese Government's restriction on Christian worship except in approved churches has drawn particular attention.
But as drafted, the bill would most likely make the U.S. Government less effective in combating religious persecution and in pressing more broadly for human rights. And it would complicate our foreign policy.
Consider Saudi Arabia, for example. A recent State Department report on religious discrimination in the world included a blistering section on Saudi Arabia. The director of the proposed new office in the White House could hardly fail to find that the Saudi Government engages in religious persecution.
The result would be to impose economic sanctions on Saudi Arabia and, among other things, subject its diplomats to intensified visa checks. Would that advance the cause of religious tolerance in Saudi Arabia?
China already presents daunting problems for Americans who want to advance human rights. Would there be a better chance of Wei Jingsheng's release from prison -- and of a general easing of repression -- if the United States denied most-favored-nation trading status to China? Or make political freedom follow increasing economic freedom? The questions are hard, and they would be made harder by a one-dimensional focus on religion.
The doubts about this legislation are increased by the fact that conservative Christian groups, including the Christian Coalition, are its strongest though not only backers. Of course their concern for persecuted Christians in the world is sincere. But they undoubtedly have another object, too: to advance their cause of giving religion a prime role in the American political structure.
Considering only the declared object of the bill -- the desirable end of fighting religious persecution in the world -- the means are mistaken. It is an attempt to impose a simple, mechanical solution on a complicated problem: a recipe for unintended consequences.

HEADLINE: Pillowtex to Acquire Fieldcrest for $400 Million

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Pillowtex Corporation, a maker of textiles for the bedroom, said yesterday that it would acquire Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., another maker of household linens, for about $400 million in cash and stock. Including debt assumption, the value of the transaction is more than $700 million.
The merged company will be the third-largest player in the $3.6 billion home textile business, which includes towels, bed pillows, blankets and similar items, with about $1.5 billion in sales. 
 Although Pillowtex, which is based in Dallas, has far smaller sales than Fieldcrest -- about $500 million and $1 billion, respectively -- as well as a smaller market capitalization, Pillowtex has performed better than Fieldcrest, and is viewed as a stronger operator.
"It is kind of like David buying Goliath," said Josephine R. Esquivel, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter. "But because there is such little overlap in products, and because Fieldcrest has been such a weak player, I think it could be a very good move."
Outside of economies of scale in purchasing and merged back-room operations, Pillowtex reaps Fieldcrest's well-known brands in sheets, comforters, towels -- some of these areas that Pillowtex had no representation in.
"We feel that through this merger," said Charles M. Hansen, chief executive of Pillowtex in a telephone interview, "we can enhance brands by increase the depth of products and offering complete sets along product lines." For example, Mr. Hansen said, Fieldcrest's well-known Royal Velvet towel, the best- selling brand in the United States, or its Cannon lines could be extended to mattress pads, comforters and other bed products through the merged business. Pillowtex also sells the Ralph Lauren, Disney and Martha Stewart lines of towels and sheets.
Fieldcrest has had trouble getting its brand names to work as hard as they could for them, analysts said, and may have weakened their position by trying too hard to get into too many types of stores.
"Some of the brand positioning was not as well thought out as it should have been," Ms. Esquivel said. "And yet they have never been able to maximize those names. The other issue is that these mills in the United State have so aggressively targeted the Wal-Marts and Kmarts. A lot of people think that is smart, but once you start to fight for a penny business, you're looking at tight margins."
Mr. Hansen said that the merged company would spend money trying to enhance the combined brand names. "They spent $45 million on capital expenditures last year," he said. "And we will take it to $60 million this year."
Bear, Stearns & Company advised Pillowtex in the deal, and Fieldcrest Cannon was represented by Credit Suisse First Boston.
In the transaction, each Fieldcrest Cannon common share will be exchanged for $27 a share in cash and $7 of Pillowtex stock, while each Fieldcrest Cannon preferred share will be exchanged for $46.15 in cash and $11.97 in Pillowtex stock.
Pillowtex said it would finance the purchase with bank loans, new debt securities and a $65 million convertible preferred stock issue to Apollo Management L.P., an investment group led by the financier Leon Black. Mr. Hansen said that he expected the merger to result in $30 million in cost savings.
There has been speculation about such a merger, still subject to shareholder and regulatory agency approval, in the marketplace for more than a year. In July, when talk of the deal heated up, shares in both companies began long rides up. In April, Fieldcrest's shares traded around $15. They closed yesterday at $34.125, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Pillowtex traded around $16 in April, and closed yesterday at $28.25, up $4.4375.
Pillowtex had acquired a Fieldcrest Cannon blanket-making plant and assets for $30 million in November.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Off Sharply

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The number of unemployed workers filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 14,000 in the latest week, the Government said today, in part because of the shortened Labor Day holiday week. The Labor Department said 310,000 people filed first-time claims for state compensation in the week that ended last Saturday, down from 324,000 claims in the previous week. The figure was lower than expected by Wall Street economists, who had forecast 325,000 claims. The four-week moving average showed 324,000 new claims, down 1,750 from the prior week.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Shrinks by 11.2% Annual Rate

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Japan's economy saw its sharpest contraction since the oil shock 23 years ago, with economic output in the second quarter falling at a startling annual rate of 11.2 percent, the Government said today.
While economists had expected a contraction because of the effects of a sharp increase in the national sales tax during the quarter, the size of the drop in output was surprising and dashed hopes that an early recovery from the nation's long economic slump was in the works. Japan had strong growth in the first quarter, and so officials had suggested that a turnaround was in the works. 
 The decline in output -- and particularly the fact that it was exacerbated by weak consumer demand -- is sure to fuel friction between Japanese and American officials, who have been urging Japan to pay closer attention to its domestic economy and not to try to export its way out of its slump. Strong Japanese exports and stagnant imports have contributed to a persistent climb in Japan's trade surplus, which rose again in July, the Government said today.
So, as the economy of the United States gallops along, with Europe cantering behind, the drop in Japan stands out as a major policy failure and underscores the enormous challenges that Japan still faces in trying to recover from its economic mess.
"It is a terribly shocking figure," said Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute. "I had a very negative outlook to begin with, but what happened was even worse."
The economy has dramatically seesawed this year primarily because of the increase in April, to 5 percent from 3 percent, in the sales tax on virtually all goods sold in Japan. Frantic buying ahead of the tax increase had helped Japan's economy -- its real gross domestic product -- leap ahead at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier, according to revised figures released today by the Government's Economic Planning Agency. In last year's second quarter, output shrank at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, though in the fourth quarter of 1996, it grew at a rate of 3.8 percent.
"Complete uncertainty prevails," said Jesper Koll, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd. in Tokyo. "It's such a Yo-Yo pattern, such a stop-and-go. And that's the problem for the recovery and for anyone dealing with Japan. Every other quarter the bulls are right. And every other quarter the bears are right."
Today's figures are embarrassing for policy makers particularly because the Government had repeatedly insisted that the economy was strong enough to bear the sales tax increase. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and the Finance Ministry have argued that only by raising taxes can they put the Government on a sounder financial footing.
But economists here said that policy makers clearly misjudged the impact of the tax increase, and the Economic Planning Agency's deputy minister, Shimpei Nukaya, acknowledged today that the contraction was larger than initially anticipated.
As recently as Wednesday, Finance Ministry officials were declaring that Japan's economy continued to be on a mild recovery trend. And after the figures were announced today, Deputy Finance Minister Takeshi Komura gave an optimistic view of the economy.
"The tempo of economic recovery has slowed down temporarily in reaction to a buying rush ahead of the April 1 consumption tax hike," Mr. Komura said at a news conference today. "But the Government has not changed its view that the economy is slowly continuing to recover."
Mr. Takagi at the Fuji Research Institute, however, warned that Japan's economy stood on a fragile base and might be entering a recession, and several economists said the economy was unlikely to match the Government's growth target of 1.9 percent for the fiscal year ending next March 31.
Still, other economists said that the second quarter probably represented the bottom of the cycle.
"Delayed is the right word, not derailed," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. in Tokyo. "But the Japanese Government has a lot of work to do, and the Japanese Prime Minister would be the first to admit that."
Japan is likely to be severely criticized at the coming meeting in Hong Kong of the Group of Seven industrial countries. Prime Minister Hashimoto and other Japanese officials have personally told American officials, like Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, that Japan will not export its way out of its economic woes but instead will rely on growth from the domestic economy.
In fact, figures released today showed that the only bright spot in the economy was exports, which lessened the economic contraction by one percentage point for the quarter, while all other areas of potential growth -- from consumer buying power to corporate and housing investment -- were in retreat. Indeed, trade figures also released today showed that Japan's July current account surplus, measuring the flow of goods, services, investment income and other transfers, surged by 63 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier.
This was the fourth straight monthly increase in the current account surplus and raised new concern about Japan's trade relationship with America. A key benchmark -- the ratio of the surplus to gross domestic product -- rose to 2.6 percent, above the target that American officials have said they feel comfortable with, and this development is likely to raise trade frictions between America and Japan.
Perhaps in anticipation of the American response, Deputy Finance Minister Komura added today, "We are ready to promote domestic demand-led economic growth through further deregulation and fiscal structural reform."
Indeed, some economists said that today's figures could prompt the Government to abandon its fiscal austerity program and perhaps even cut corporate taxes, a move that has been encouraged by a number of Government ministries.
"For Japan to be a good global citizen," Mr. Koll at J. P. Morgan said. "It needs additional policy stimulus."

Treasuries Extend Losses A Third Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities lost ground for the third consecutive day yesterday, with traders and investors concerned that today's reports on producer prices and retail sales would show rapid growth and inflation pressures.
The 30-year bond fell 1 3/32, to a price of 96. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.69 percent, from 6.65 percent on Wednesday. 
 The average rate at the Treasury's one-year bill auction yesterday was 5.30 percent, up two-hundredths of a percentage point from last month's auction. Market analysts said selling in futures trading contributed to the negative sentiment in the cash market as well.
The supply of corporate and global debt also remained a concern of market participants, but was not seen as a major problem. The Nationsbank Corporation sold $4 billion in asset-backed debt, while Venezuela issued the same amount of 30-year bonds. The Treasury added to that with the sale of $12.5 billion of a new 52-week bill that was well bid and helped by the flight out of a slumping stock market, as the Dow dropped below 7,600 for the first time since June 26.
A morning report on weekly jobless claims raised eyebrows with a larger-than-expected drop. The weekly jobless claims for the period ended Saturday, fell 14,000, to 310,000, from the previous week, helping to further unnerve a bond market already on edge in anticipation of today's economic data for August. These indicators, along with next Tuesday's Consumer Price Index, industrial production and capacity utilization data, are likely to determine the bond market's direction and tone over the next couple of weeks.
"The Federal Open Market Committee, and particularly Fed chairman Greenspan, is known to be looking at consumer spending as the key to the economic outlook," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "and if August retail sales rise by six-tenths of a percent or higher, as many market observers expect, it will certainly lend credence to the view that consumption during the third quarter is rebounding at roughly a 4 percent pace."
Mr. Fine added: "This would most assuredly raise a yellow caution flag at the Fed, and while it may not be enough at this point to turn the tide toward tightening at the Sept. 30 F.O.M.C. powwow, any continuation of this robust consumer spending over the next two months would clearly raise the probability of a move to a less accommodative posture at the November meeting."
Inflation as measured by the core rates, excluding food and energy, for both the Producer Price Index today and Consumer Price Index on Tuesday is expected to remain subdued. But a less favorable picture is likely to emerge for the overall indexes, Mr. Fine said. In both cases the disturbing element is expected to be gasoline prices, and as a result the Producer Price Index is expected by many analysts to rise three-tenths or four-tenths of a percent.
On the heels of seven consecutive monthly declines, a jump this large will certainly be noticed. "Indeed," Mr. Fine said, "even if both retail sales and the P.P.I. hit the tapes as expected, bond market yields could still move to higher ground over time, and while an unchanged Fed policy over the near term seems to be the most likely prognosis at the moment, it is by no means carved in stone."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 52-week bill:

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall for 2d Day on Profit Forecasts

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Most major stock market indexes fell for a second day yesterday as investors reacted to another round of company announcements of expected earnings shortfalls in the third quarter.
In particular, Ascend Communications and Corning suffered heavy declines after both companies announced that third-quarter earnings would probably fall below forecasts. 
 In response to such news, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.30 points, to 7,660.98. The Dow is now only 38.56 points above the low of 7,622.42 it touched after reaching its record high of 8,259.31 on Aug. 6.
The Standard and Poor's index of 500 companies slipped 6.44, to 912.59.
But the Nasdaq composite index, which contains a concentration of small companies and technology stocks, managed to eke out a gain of 0.61 point, to 1,639.86.
The previous day's drop -- the Dow fell more than 130 points on Wednesday -- was caused in part by the recent strength of the dollar. Investors fear that a stronger dollar could reduce the earnings of large, multinational companies, which gain a portion of their revenues from business activities abroad.
But the dollar was mixed yesterday. It declined against the German mark for the second consecutive session but continued its strong performance against the Japanese yen and most Southeast Asian currencies. Prices of Treasury securities fell for a third day, and the yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.69 percent.
Still, investors remained skittish amid the latest earnings disappointments and as they awaited the release of some of the first August inflation indicators, today's Producer Price Index and retail sales reports.
"There is a real worry in the stock and bond markets that things may have accelerated on the economic side in August," said Hugh Johnson chief investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation.
After the close of trading yesterday, there was another jolt: Motorola announced that its third-quarter earnings would be hurt by weakening demand for pagers in the United States and China and because of a one-time $95 million charge for leaving the market for Apple Macintosh computer clones.
As trading opened, stocks immediately moved lower, with the Dow off as much as 138.43 points at one point. But equity prices moved away from the lows in the afternoon, analysts said, because investors were encouraged by comments from two market watchers.
In a speech in Denver to some regional board members of the Federal Reserve, Alice Rivlin, the Fed vice chairwoman, reiterated a stance taken last week by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, saying that the economy has been growing strongly and experiencing low unemployment without a significant pickup in inflation.
Some investors took that to mean that the Fed might be reluctant to raise interest rates.
In addition, Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of Goldman, Sachs & Company's investment policy committee, said in an interview in a French magazine that she thought that stocks would recover from their recent lows and set new records.
Ascend Communications, a computer networking company, was the most actively traded issue, with 27.7 million shares trading. Shares of the company fell more than 5 percent amid concerns that slowing sales and growing competition would hurt third-quarter earnings. Ascend fell 2 3/16, to 37 13/16, a 52-week low.
In addition, Corning shares fell 11.5 percent, or 5 7/16, to 41 15/16. The glass materials and component manufacturer cited decreased demand from telecommunications equipment manufacturers for its fiber optic equipment.
Motorola moved little during the day but plunged in after-hours trading, when it fell 8 3/8, to 66.
But not all of the earnings news was negative.
Adobe Systems rose 3 9/16, to 44 9/16, after the company said it expected to exceed analysts' forecasts because of strong orders for its desktop publishing and graphics software products.
AT&T shares gained 1 1/16, to 43, because of investor optimism that the company would meet earnings forecasts, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Salmon War in Northwest Spurs Wish for Good Fences

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Sept. 11

 BODY:
It started with a maritime blockade angry Canadian fishermen holding an Alaska ferry at bay for three days. Then came an abrupt move to shut down an American torpedo-testing range in British Columbia, followed by three international lawsuits and a barrage of insults between politicians who usually excel at cross-border backslapping.
Talk radio in Vancouver has been hot with anti-American sentiment, while south of the 49th parallel, a Seattle newspaper ran a suggestive headline: "Let's Take Canada, Eh?" 
 This is war, both sides insist, though it is only the kind of war that a region once called Ecotopia could produce -- the "salmon war," a fight over who gets to keep fish that are ignorant of an invisible line of sovereignty in 52-degree water.
It is somewhat surprising that people are at each other's throats over the most sacred of regional icons: "salmon, our statue of liberty," in the words of Ethan Seltzer, a professor of urban studies at Portland State University.
But what has perplexed many in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia is that an area that has held itself up as a 21st-century model -- a bio-region without borders -- has fallen into old-fashioned nationalism: flag-burnings, insults based on national stereotypes, and even a mild version of gunboat diplomacy.
All of this was not supposed to happen in the self-named region of Cascadia, a region that shares a rainy climate, a culture tilting toward Asia and a sense that it is the envy of the world.
"You don't go around saying some of the things that have been said in recent days without causing some serious, long-term damage," said Alan Artibise, president of the Cascadia Institute, a nonprofit research group in Vancouver. "If we can't cooperate over the very thing that we brag about so much, which we all love, what does that say about us?"
Raising the stakes in the conflict, Premier Glen Clark of British Columbia filed a lawsuit in Seattle this week, contending that American fishermen had broken an international treaty, and seeking damages from the United States in excess of $300 million. The suit has infuriated Washington's normally low-key Governor, Gary Locke, a Democrat.
Premier Clark had already taken aim at Governor Locke and others in an extraordinary advertising campaign this summer, in which he accused Americans of trying to kill the great salmon bounty.
"I had a private talk with Premier Clark, and he made it very clear to me he's willing to grandstand this issue, and fish the salmon to extinction if that's what it takes," Mr. Locke said in an interview. "He's very good at trying to stir up feelings of resentment against us. That won't save a single fish."
The Canadians say Americans are taking more than 500,000 sockeye salmon as they swim through Alaskan waters on their way south to Canada to spawn. The Americans say the Canadians have excessively fished the prized coho and chinook salmon off British Columbia as they make their way to American spawning waters.
The British Columbians, who have long regarded their distant capital in Ottawa the way many Pacific Northwesterners regard their distant capital in Washington, D.C., filed the lawsuit against the wishes of their own national government, which is the only body than can negotiate international salmon treaties. But even though the fight involves perhaps no more than 300 fishing jobs, it has symbolic resonance that goes well beyond its economic numbers.
"The people of British Columbia are with me," Mr. Clark said. "That's all I care about. This fight goes to the very soul of British Columbia."
In fact, it goes to the soul of the entire region, an area promoted abroad as a "two-nation vacation," and held up by President Clinton as a model of Pacific Age cooperation. In art, literature, trade, transportation, food trends and geographic self-identity, the Cascadia region of Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and southeastern Alaska has seemed to grow closer every year.
But all of that changed in July, when nearly a hundred Canadian fishing boats prevented the Alaska ferry Malaspina from leaving the British Columbia port of Prince Rupert. It was a protest, they said, against American fishing of salmon bound for Canadian spawning streams.
A month before the blockade, four American fishing ships were detained in a British Columbia port, prompting Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, to suggest a Coast Guard or Navy escort for other fishing vessels.
What started as a fishing dispute spread. After the the three-day blockade, Alaska canceled ferry service to Prince Rupert, cutting off a main two-way tourist link. Merchants in the town say they have lost nearly half their summer business, and have been flooded with phone calls by people wondering if it is safe to travel the normally placid byways of British Columbia.
"We've been getting all kinds of messages from people concerned about their safety, people wondering if they should change their American license plates to avoid trouble once they get here," said Bill Smith, the city manager of Prince Rupert. "We have so much in common, it just doesn't make any sense to be hammering at each other like this."
This week Alaskan officials announced the cancellation of ferry service to Prince Rupert through the summer of next year, as well. The cancellation came after Premier Clark tried to evict the United States Navy from a torpedo testing range at Nanoose Bay, British Columbia. The effort has been halted, temporarily, by the Canadian Government, which asserts that the province does not have jurisdiction over the Navy's lease.
As much as the ferry blockade incensed people, the burning of an American flag at the height of the Prince Rupert protest is frequently evoked in talk radio and newspaper letters as a flare-up point for long-dormant nationalism.
But Mr. Smith noted that the flag-burner was a fisherman with both Canadian and United States citizenship, making the point that perhaps Cascadia lives even in a salmon war.
The last time the word "war" was widely used to describe a conflict between two countries was in 1859, and a pig was at the root of the dispute. A pig owned by a British settler on San Juan Island in Juan de Fuca Strait, north of Puget Sound, wandered into the potato patch of an American farmer, who shot it. The British said the farmer had no right to shoot a pig on British soil, though the Americans also claimed the island.
The United States deployed troops to San Juan and British warships promptly appeared, but the "pig war" ended without a shot being fired. The boundary dispute was finally resolved in 1872, when the San Juan archipelago was given to the United States.
Much of the current conflict has been characterized as a comic descendant of the pig war.
"It reminds me of that Monty Python movie with a siege at a medieval castle," said Mr. Seltzer, the Portland State professor. "One side throws insults down the wall and the other threatens to hurl cows back."
Recent polls show that the heated talk has helped Mr. Clark, who is in his second year as Premier of the most prosperous province in Canada. But the Canadian Government has been urging him to back down and let American and Canadian diplomats work toward a renewed salmon treaty. Provisions that govern the number of fish that can be taken by each side expired in 1994.
Mr. Clark said he expects the current diplomatic efforts to go nowhere. "They are just talking about talk," he said. So he is using lawsuits, the threat to the torpedo range and media pressure to force the issue.
The Premier expressed sympathy with the ferry blockade, calling the action of the fishermen "courageous." They have been sued by the State of Alaska for causing a loss of millions of dollars in revenue.
Governor Locke expressed hope that the salmon war was only between politicians. "Mr. Clark has made this very personal, by attacking the leaders in the United States," he said. "The bond between our people remains strong."
The view in another reach of Cascadia is somewhat different. "We have a saying here in Canada," said Mr. Artibise in Vancouver. "The Americans are our best friends, whether we like them or not."

HEADLINE: Major Shift for Communist China: Big State Industries Will Be Sold

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, Sept. 12

 BODY:
China's leaders have agreed to sell off most of the nation's big state-owned industries, and outlined plans today at the opening of a Communist Party congress that is setting the nation's political and economic agenda for the post-Deng era.
A central theme of the congress, the party's 15th, will be endorsing a ground-breaking shift from socialist-style state ownership to a system of share-holding. More than 10,000 of China's 13,000 large and medium-sized state enterprises are likely to be sold, though many issues -- like who the buyers will be -- remain unclear. 
 Elder party members have objected that China may be dissolving the last solid pillar of its socialist system, but President Jiang Zemin has apparently persuaded decision-makers that they can no longer afford the burden of inefficient and money-losing industries, no matter the risks.
Still ruled by a party that calls itself Communist, however, Mr. Jiang and his allies are relying on semantical gymnastics to justify the move. Avoiding the word "privatization," they instead insists that when ordinary people buy shares of stock it is a form of "public ownership."
"Even if the state-owned sector accounts for a smaller proportion of the economy, this will not affect the socialist nature of our country," Mr. Jiang said today in a speech at the opening of the congress.
By whatever name, Chinese leaders are essentially abandoning what has been a central principle of Communist rule since the revolution here nearly 50 years ago: that the state would retain its position as the dominant owner of industry.
"What is socialism?" said Dong Fureng, a senior economist advising government leaders on how to make the shift to share-holding. "It means seeking social equality, not that the state has to keep a majority stake in every industry."
The long-term effect of changing such a critical system of ownership, perhaps lying beyond the political calculus of leaders now consumed by short-term crises, seems destined to move China's economy toward an even more capitalist and free market system, one where the Communist Party may have difficulty preserving the role it has today.
For now, however, the party dominates politics in this country, and the congress, with more than 2,000 delegates, is the most important political gathering here since the last party congress five years ago. With the main policy issue already decided, the principal drama at the weeklong congress is expected to lie in changes in the top leadership.
Since China's leaders still select themselves and make important decisions in secret, with little accountability to public opinion, high-level politics resemble a continuous campaign of infighting and ever-shifting alliances among the 19 members of the Politburo, particularly among the top three: President Jiang, Prime Minister Li Peng and the legislative chief, Qiao Shi.
A party congress is generally stage-managed to display an aura of unity to the public, while the senior leaders are actually involved in intense power struggles backstage, sometimes yielding important decisions only at the last minute.
One of the most-watched issues at this year's congress is what jobs await Mr. Jiang's top colleagues and rivals, Mr. Li and Mr. Qiao, both of whom are expected to relinquish their current positions. Though the congress has begun, the answers remain uncertain.
Like all capital cities, Beijing thrives on rumors and intrigue. But the center of power here is so well concealed by secretive tradition, and insulated by loyal aides, that outsiders rarely learn much about inside politics until well after the fact, if then.
It is clear, however, that the 15th party congress -- coming six months after the death of Deng Xiaoping -- is well timed to showcase Mr. Jiang as the leader likely to dominate the near future. A move to enshrine "Deng Xiaoping theory" in China's Constitution alongside "Mao Zedong Thought" appears to be an effort to line Mr. Jiang up as a leader on a par with Mao and Deng.
Although economic reality is helping force Mr. Jiang's hand on state enterprises, the political timetable of the party congress may have spurred him to act sooner than he would otherwise. Mr. Jiang needs to show he can be bold and is not just a follower of Deng, and reforming state ownership is the issue he has grasped.
Shifting ownership is a tremendously complex legal and organizational challenge, several economists said, with a serious danger that state assets will disappear into the pockets of factory managers during the transition. Industrial managers, traditionally an important constituency in China, are likely either to become corporate executives, or to get left out of the new system altogether if they cannot adjust.
Many officials argue that despite the planned changes, the state may remain the main owner in China for some time, since in many cases the shift to a share-holding system will transfer ownership to shares controlled by a specific government-run organization or company.
Since the plans have not yet been announced in detail, it is unclear exactly what role the state will play. Yet a vast sale of state assets will sharply reduce central control over large enterprises.
At greatest risk may be tens of millions of urban workers whose jobs are at stake. Yet leaders seem to think their best hope is to brave layoffs, which are inevitable, at a time when the overall economy is growing fast and some labor can be absorbed by non-state companies that are expanding.
After all, China's recent economic history has confounded most experts, domestic and foreign.
Not long ago, it was inconceivable that ordinary people in China would be able to buy and sell shares of stock freely, or have access to almost any consumer goods on the world market. Or that such choice would be accompanied by a significant loosening of government control over daily life, like choosing a job or where to live.
Perhaps the greatest paradox in China today is the way its enormous economic and social change over the last decade has seen virtually no corresponding alteration of the political structure, which is still dominated by Communist Party officials.
"There is no real point in talking about political reform at this point," said a Chinese political scientist in Beijing. "Leaders will not change the system themselves, they will only respond to demands from society. So ownership reform is very meaningful in that it gives ordinary people a voice."
In recent years, though the private sector of China's economy has grown fast while the state sector atrophied, leaders seemed stymied about what to do with state industries, which have always been described as the unshakable core of China's economic system. Before starting any bold initiatives, it seemed, leaders were waiting for Mr. Deng's death, which finally came this year on Feb. 19.
Mr. Jiang broached the topic of ownership reform in May in a speech at the Central Committee's Party School, winning consensus from other leaders over the summer.
On Sept. 2, the New China News Agency carried an authoritative report specifying that more than 10,000 of the nation's 13,000 large and medium-sized enterprises would be "encouraged to switch to various forms of public ownership."
"The financial dilemma of the state sector continues to be the outstanding problem of the Chinese economy," the agency said. "But hope returned when Chinese President Jiang Zemin called for a powerful change in economic reform."
The same dispatch was accompanied by a spirited rejection of any suggestion that Mr. Jiang might be endorsing privatization, which has always been a bad word in Communist China's political lexicon.
"The share-holding system has nothing to do with privatization," said Wang Jiaqiu, vice president of the Party School, the news agency reported. "The system only provides a method to achieve public ownership and will bring no change to the present economic structure where public ownership is in the leading position."
Stressing "public ownership," while selling state industry, recalls Chinese slogans like "a socialist market economy" or "socialism with Chinese characteristics," that justify a capitalist economic necessity by invoking socialist ideology.
A key role in Mr. Jiang's efforts to push through approval of a share-holding system will be played by the man most likely to carry it out: Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is widely expected to become Prime Minister next year. Sometimes called "China's Gorbachev" by Westerners who see him as a strict manager and visionary, Mr. Zhu is said to hate the name, worrying that it exposes him to accusations that his leadership might lead to the undermining of the party.
A former Mayor and party chief of Shanghai, where he battled an entrenched bureaucracy and began a stunning economic transformation, Mr. Zhu moved to Beijing in 1993 to take the seemingly impossible task of bringing order to China's economy. Inflation had surged to 24 percent and raised fears that it would provoke unrest among China's low-paid factory workers.
Mr. Zhu dismissed the head of China's central bank, assuming the job himself and instituting a strict credit policy that was deeply unpopular with factory heads, who were used to getting whatever subsidies and loans they needed. To virtually everyone's surprise, Mr. Zhu stuck to his position, and inflation fell to 2 percent in this year's second quarter, without hampering China's overall economic growth rate.
Now Mr. Zhu has pledged that he will attack state-owned enterprises with the same vigor to achieve their reform within three years.
"The key problem in China's industry is that ownership is unclear," said He Yang, a former official who now runs his own investment company. "People say 'the state,' but who is that? The central government? A certain ministry? A local government? Everyone wants to exert authority, and take profit, but no one wants to take responsibility when there are losses."
Mr. He cited a typical predicament for a large electronics company: the State Planning Commission supervises its investment plans, the Ministry of Electronics Industry appoints its leaders and the Ministry of Internal Trade looks after its sales.
"They all want power, none want responsibility," Mr. He said. "No one, and I mean no one, takes responsibility when a company fails. It's always someone else's fault."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the Communist Party congress in China misstated the date of the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing. It was 1989, not 1988.

The exhibit coincides with the Communist Party congress. (Reuters)(pg. A10); Deng Xiaoping at the 12th Party Congress in 1982. (Associted Press)(pg. A10)
 
Chart: "KEEPING TRACK: Erosion of Maoism"
 
1977 - 11TH PARTY CONGRESS
A year after the Cultural Revolution ended, Mao's successor, Hua Guofeng, promises to uphold Maoist policy, speaks about inevitability of a world war and describes relations with the United States as "temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional."
 
1982 - 12TH PARTY CONGRESS
Deng Xiaoping, now the undisputed leader, presides over a gathering that repudiates everything endorsed at the previous congress. His hand-picked deputy, Hu Yaobang, calls Maoism "wrong in its theories, policies and slogans." Deng presses his campaign to build "socialism with Chinese characteristics," including disbanding communes and allowing farmers to sell grain on an open market.
 
1987 - 13TH PARTY CONGRESS
With Deng in the background and Hu sacked nine months earlier, Zhao Ziyang presides as the new party chief. He says China is in "the primary stage of socialism," meaning that since Communism will not be reached for another 100 years, it is O.K. to experiment with distinctly non-Communist measures, like profit incentives for factories and free enterprise on a small scale.
 
1992 - 14TH PARTY CONGRESS
With Zhao sacked after resisting the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1988, Jiang Zemin is the new Communist Party chief, but relies heavily on the authority of the frail Deng. Making a "socialist market economy" is the favored phrase, meaning any effort can be made to achieve an efficient market economy as long as everything is called socialist.
 
1997 - 15TH PARTY CONGRESS
With Deng dead and other rivals sidelined, Jiang asserts his authority as the new leader of China. A plan to sell most state-owned industries to a share- holding system is deemed appropriate by calling it "public ownership" instead of the "state ownership" that is mandated in the Constitution.

HEADLINE: Don't Fear Inflation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Sept. 6 Business Day article on the latest public statement by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, highlighted his recognition that recent robust economic growth, coupled with little price inflation, has not been in accord with historical experience. As a result, the Fed's analysts are handicapped for lack of accurate data to work on.
Fiscal policy is drastically tighter today than it was in the 1980's and early 90's. Thus, the Federal budget is no longer pouring huge amounts of excess liquidity into the economy, leaving the job of overall demand management to the Fed. On the contrary, fiscal policy is automatically draining away a large part of any excess liquidity through its shift toward budget surpluses. 
 In this environment, the Fed must be careful not to be an agent of instability. Premature tightening of monetary policy could result in a sharp slide back into budget deficit. Mr. Greenspan, knowing this, is unlikely to try to constrain growth without more evidence than we have that demand is outrunning productivity.
Alarmists who see inflation lurking behind every bush are failing to recognize a big change in the Federal budget's role as an automatic stabilizer.

Seeing Money as the Ruler, More Despotic Than Kind

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The United States has a new social disease, or maybe it's just an old one with a new name. As introduced on Monday, "Affluenza" is "an unhappy condition of overload, debt, anxiety and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more." Among the symptoms collected by doctors, psychologists, environmentalists, poll experts, therapists and authors of books with titles like "Marketing Madness" and "Your Money or Your Life" are swollen expectations, shopping fever, chronic stress and fractured families.
Scott Simon of National Public Radio sets the program's tone, delivering the dire diagnosis with a smile, relieving his moralisms with mild jokes. His concerns are heavy, his touch is light. 
 From the ancient prophets to today's public scolds, the basic ailment -- money as the root of malaise -- has not gone unnoticed, but the desperate cases described here seem particularly susceptible to the merchandising mania of our time: young couples, inveigled into accepting credit cards and whipped into a frenzy of shopping by television commercials, spend their waking hours at malls, plunge into bankruptcy and wind up feeling that their lives are as empty as their bank accounts.
Monday night's anti-materialistic alliance finds conservative evangelical ministers joining liberal secularists in an anti-buying campaign. They are especially troubled by advertising's power over children, who learn the brand names before they learn to read, and quickly master the 11th Commandment -- Thou Must Have That -- before finding out about the others. (A Disney marketeer explains that his high-pressure tactics are "empowering" children.)
As long as "Affluenza" demonstrates how the buy-buy-buy engine runs the economy and directs mass desires, it is persuasive if not notably original. (Thorstein Veblen had something to say about such matters a century ago.) And the advice to the stressed-out to reflect on the meaning of things is surely wholesome.
This otherwise welcome and peppy program may leave the impression that if only the marketers and advertisers laid off, the rich would be less hoggish and the poor would be more content. When it turns to the gap between rich and poor in the United States and elsewhere, the program becomes a touch soft-minded as well as soft-hearted: two young women who have visited Mexico report that Mexicans are loving and giving despite being poor. And it is wishfully suggested that an anti-growth movement is asurge around the world.
Despite claims made in the program for the spread of thrift and the celebration of those who are snipping up their credit cards and going in for "voluntary simplicity," my money remains on the power of conspicuous consumption.
 
'Wallace Stegner'
'A Writer's Life'
PBS, tomorrow night at 7
 This affectionate portrait concentrates on Wallace Stegner's vision of America's West, which contradicted Hollywood's wide-open-spaces mythology. Best remembered for his early novel, "Big Rock Candy Mountain," and for "Angle of Repose," which brought him a Pulitzer Prize, Stegner saw the region's history as a series of raids by the powerful on the powerless for control of nature's riches. His heart was with the little losers and the big country.
The program makes striking use of pictures of the lands that inspired both Stegner's fiction and his articles in behalf of conservation. The narration, delivered by Robert Redford, avoids the shadows of literary criticism. Whatever the fate of his reputation as a writer, Stegner, who was extensively interviewed in the months before his death in 1993, makes a thoughtful, likable, unassuming commentator on his career.

HEADLINE: Life Insurer, In Comeback, Is Set for Sale

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Six years after the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company became the largest American insurance company ever to collapse, the company has been revived and is expected to announce on Monday that it is for sale.
No price has been established, but investment bankers estimate that the company could bring as much as $1.5 billion. 
 The book value, or net worth, of the company is about $500 million, and life insurers have sold recently for up to two and a half to three times book value.
For the 450,000 policyholders and pension plan members of Mutual Benefit, a sale should come as much-awaited good news. The uncertainty of the future of their investments will be gone, the interest rates on their investments will be restored to at least market rates and they will share in the proceeds of the sale.
Investment bankers and insurance analysts said they expected, as one banker put it, "significant interest in this situation."
"Everybody in the business is looking to achieve economies of scale," the banker said. "The size is right. It's large enough, but not so large as to knock out a lot of potential buyers."
Some analysts said they expected to see low bids because as a company in rehabilitation -- the insurance equivalent of bankruptcy -- Mutual Benefit has been on the sidelines of the industry, unable to generate new business and keep up with advances in technology and product design. Yet Ronald McIntosh, an insurance analyst at the Fox-Pitt Kelton brokerage firm, said, "These types of distressed and recovered properties have provided very handsome returns to people who have bought them in the past."
Alan J. Bowers, the chief executive, said the company, which now operates as the MBL Life Assurance Corporation, plans to formally announce its sale intentions on Monday. He has been briefing employees, creditors and policyholder representatives since the board voted unanimously on Tuesday in favor of selling.
A sale will be subject to the approval of the company's major creditors, the New Jersey Superior Court and Elizabeth E. Randall, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance in New Jersey.
Ms. Randall, who, at the direction of the court has been presiding over the recovery as chairman of Mutual Benefit, said the company had fully recovered and was ready to resume normal operations, more than two years before the target date of Dec. 31, 1999.
"The company is in exceptionally good health," Ms. Randall said, "and is now being offered for sale."
Larry Mayewski, a senior insurance analyst at the A. M. Best Company, a rating agency, said that potential buyers might include some of the big mutual life insurance companies like Prudential Insurance, Metropolitan Life, New York Life and John Hancock. Other analysts said that American General and Conseco, which have been leading a consolidation trend, might also want to take a look.
The Newark-based Mutual Benefit was seized by New Jersey insurance regulators on July 16, 1991, as the gap between its assets and its liabilities grew to an estimated $1 billion. Since then, it has essentially been a company frozen in time.
Still, it does have several selling points, including 450,000 customers who hung on to their policies and pension plans rather than cash out at a steep discount. It also has assets of $14 billion, which produced revenues last year of $2.1 billion, and an investment portfolio that is heavy on corporate bonds and light on real estate, the reverse of the situation when the company was taken over by the regulators. Its net worth has risen to about $500 million from $57 million in 1994, with the increase attributed mainly to the sale of real estate.
Analysts said the company was coming on the market at a time when there are more buyers than sellers and prices are good. "It's entirely possible that one of the leading acquirers will look at this block of business and conclude that they can cut costs materially or improve the claims experience and make a bid," said Eric N. Berg, an insurance analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.
"There are two parts that people look at in valuing a life insurance company," Mr. Berg said. "The insurance already on the books and the value that flows from having agents that can produce new business. Today distribution -- the sales force -- is at a premium."
Although MBL Life has no full-time agents, the company has about 2,500 independent agents under limited contract, many of whom were part of a 1,400-member force that was disbanded after Mutual Benefit's collapse. They have been collecting commissions on policy renewals and responding to customer queries.
Those independent agents, Mr. Berg said, add something to the price of the company. "These are agents that are familiar with the company and willing to produce new sales for it," he said. "There's value there."
Mutual Benefit's troubles began in the 1980's when, trying to provide high interest rates that would keep its insurance policies and pension plans competitive, it invested heavily in real estate and leveraged buyouts. But real estate prices collapsed, and many of the buyout deals failed. The company's ratings then began to fall, and customers started cashing in their policies and pensions. The company, however, could not raise money from the depressed real estate and, with the company's deficit growing, the regulators stepped in.
Many insurance companies got into similar difficulties, and several failed. Mutual Benefit was the biggest, ranked 21st at that time in terms of assets, behind Allstate's life insurance operations, which had $14.8 billion in assets.
The recovery was begun by the Palmieri Company, a turnaround specialist firm led by Victor H. Palmieri. He had made a name for himself by nursing the Penn Central Transportation Company back to health in the early 1970's but he lost some of his luster when he was unable to resuscitate the Crazy Eddie electronics retailer in the late 1980's. The plan Mr. Palmieri developed for Mutual Benefit -- which was paid for by Mutual Benefit and involved no financial cost to New Jersey or industry-backed guarantee funds -- called for hiring an executive to complete the job. In mid-1995, Mr. Bowers, a managing partner in the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand, was named chief executive.
Mr. Bowers accelerated the sale of real estate and the investment in bonds, and negotiated an end to a dispute between creditors and policyholders over the assets of the company. The 14 major creditors, including the Bank of America, Bankers Trust New York, Morgan Guaranty Trust and Citibank, along with hundreds of smaller creditors eventually agreed to accept 70 percent of the company, leaving 30 percent to the policyholders. When the company is sold, the proceeds will be shared in those proportions.
For the last several months, Mr. Bowers and his staff; the Monitor Company, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., founded by Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School, and investment bankers from Goldman, Sachs & Company have been studying whether the company should resume regular business on its own, enter a joint venture or be sold. In a two-day meeting on Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Bowers reviewed the options with the 10-member board of MBL Life and the board chose the option of selling. Goldman, Sachs is to handle the transaction, Mr. Bowers said.
In the end, Mr. Bowers said, the pivotal question became whether "to try to catch up with the marketplace by ourselves or to become part of another leading, well-rated, highly respected financial services organization."

HEADLINE: Black and Cuban-American: Bias in 2 Worlds

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 12

 BODY:
When black and Hispanic residents in this racially polarized city fought over a vacant City Commission seat, Henry Crespo stepped in and offered himself as the solution.
Being both black and Cuban, and a Spanish-speaker who lives in a black neighborhood, Mr. Crespo said he could bridge their worlds. But blacks said they would only accept a "black American" and Cubans regarded him as an oddity with questionable allure. 
 Mr. Crespo was not appointed to the commission; the seat went to an African-American woman.
"I'm as black as you can get but I'm Cuban," Mr. Crespo, 33, said recently, while on his job as housing director of the small city of Opa-Locka, near Miami, where he lives. "I have to be myself, understanding that I can't please everybody."
As black and Hispanic, Mr. Crespo is part of two worlds he says he relishes equally. But as African-Americans and Hispanic Americans wrestle for political influence here and the Hispanic majority increases, what Mr. Crespo sees as an advantage, indeed a rich example of multiculturalism, can also be a liability.
Black Cuban-Americans find themselves in a bind. As Cubans they belong to an immigrant group that has enjoyed tremendous economic and political success. But as blacks they have experienced the discrimination and hardships of African-Americans.
And they remain virtually invisible in the Miami power structure -- there are no black Cuban-American elected officials, no leaders of a major exile group and no major academic studies documenting their migration -- even though they are more representative of an island where half or more of the population is now estimated to be black and mulatto.
"People think I'm Dominican," said Alexis Barcelay, 25, a black boxer who left Cuba by going to the American naval base on Guantanamo Bay three years ago. "I have to tell them that there are blacks in Cuba, too."
Part of their invisibility is the result of their small numbers. The 1990 census found that fewer than 30,000 of nearly one million Hispanic residents in Dade County, or 3 percent, were black, most of them Cubans, with some Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. Nationwide, black Hispanic residents were also 3 percent of all Hispanic residents, the census showed.
Sociologists here say one reason that whites have overwhelmingly predominated in the exodus from revolutionary Cuba in the last 38 years is that the first waves of immigrants consisted mainly of the white elite who then sponsored relatives into the United States. And many blacks stayed behind longer because they had supported a revolution that provided social gains, opening educational and professional opportunities previously denied them, even if it had not extended equally to leadership positions in government.
But black Cubans say Cuba's Government has also hampered their migration through propaganda that paints the United States society as violently racist and by portraying those who want to leave as not only traitors but ingrates.
Cuba's dismal economic problems have compelled more blacks to leave in recent years, experts on Cuban affairs say, although information on the demographics of the most recent waves of immigrants is scarce. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, for instance, says it keeps no racial breakdown of the estimated 20,000 Cubans allowed to immigrate legally into this country each year.
But even more crucial than numbers in determining influence for black Cubans here has been their inability to fully integrate into either the black or Hispanic worlds, which requires them to overcome cultural and linguistic barriers among blacks and racism among white Hispanic residents.
Studies by a geography professor at the University of Miami, Thomas D. Boswell, show that the median income of black Hispanic residents of Dade County lagged behind that of white Hispanic residents -- $8,000 to $11,100 -- although the disparity was less than that between non-Hispanic whites and blacks. And his analysis of the 1990 census found the largest concentrations of black Hispanic Miamians in neighborhoods like Allapattah, sandwiched between Hispanic Little Havana and black Liberty City.
The predicament afflicts parents like Emmanuel and Luz Mery Angarica, a black Cuban and a white Colombian, who say they are rearing their 6-year-old son as "American," with no racial or ethnic labels, after two older sons suffered confusion and harassment from schoolmates over choosing an ethnic identity. "We never said anything but there was pressure from the other children to join their band," Mrs. Angarica, 47, said. "One of them came home from school and told me, 'Mommy, I am red.' Now we're going to be more careful."
The two older brothers chose black because African-Americans were in the majority at their school.
Black Cubans like Carlos Moore, 53, are not torn about their ethnic identity. In 1986, when Mr. Moore was a professor at Florida International University, he came under harsh attack on Spanish-language radio and received death threats for focusing on racial issues and portraying revered white Cuban patriots as racists in a course at the university. He said the harassment forced him to leave Miami in 1987.
Mr. Moore, now a professor of international relations at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, said his experiences here convinced him that those like him should come out "against racism" and ally themselves with other blacks, both Hispanic and African-American.
The substantial number of blacks in Cuba are descendants of slaves brought to the island from Africa to work the sugar plantations, and blacks from other Caribbean islands who came after slavery to do the same work.
"I have everything in common with the American black," Mr. Moore said, "the history, slavery, being kicked by whites."
For Rosa Reed, 43, a manager for a pharmaceutical company who moved to the United States from Cuba when she was 5, a watershed moment came in 1990, when she said she was dismissed from a Cuban-American organization when she assumed the role of spokeswoman for one of its programs.
"I was told that when Americans saw a black person they saw crime and poverty and that for the benefit of the organization I couldn't be a spokesperson," Ms. Reed said. "It was so shocking."
Ms. Reed now writes a current affairs column for a black newspaper, The Miami Times, is engaged to an African-American and belongs to a group of black Cuban-Americans that is holding talks with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People intended to start a nationwide black Hispanic section. The group is rallying around domestic issues like sensitizing white Hispanic Americans to racial discrimination in employment and other forms of racism suffered by black Hispanic Americans.
But the group of black Cuban-Americans says it is also concerned about supporting blacks in Cuba, who they say suffer the island's economic hardships more acutely than whites because fewer can count on relatives here to send them money and basic necessities.
A poll of Cuban-Americans in Dade County this year by Florida International University and The Miami Herald indeed showed marked differences between black and white Cubans in attitudes toward Cuba, with more blacks favoring a dialogue with the Cuban Government to help bring about democracy and opposing continuing the American embargo of Cuba or military action to overthrow President Fidel Castro.
Because Hispanic populations are the product of different racial influences, for instance, racial self-definitions go beyond black and white. A Cuban regarded as black by American standards could be "moro," "indian" or "jabao" in Cuba, depending on skin color and hair texture, with the gradations making racial classifications more ambiguous.
Cubans like Manuel Elizondo, 38, a trainer on the Cuban Olympic boxing team who defected in 1994, said they find racism to be worse in this country.
"In Cuba, racism dictates who is a leader and who is not," Mr. Elizondo said. "Here, because private property is allowed, the racism is determined by money. There are more class differences."
But ethnicity has a stronger pull than race in his new country, which has forced two new identities on him: black (in Cuba he was considered mulatto or Indian) and Hispanic.
"I'm Cuban and I speak Spanish," Mr. Elizondo said. "I am who I am, and I live in my own world."
But those with political aspirations like Mr. Crespo, a Manhattan native, have no such luxury. The sharpest criticism against Mr. Crespo when he sought a City Commission seat vacated by a Hispanic lawyer facing criminal charges, who himself had replaced a black commissioner who is in prison on a bribery conviction, came from black civic and political leaders. The loss of the commission's only black left the panel with four Hispanic members and one white one.
"It worked against him by the fact that he tossed the word Cuban out there," said one of the critics, the Rev. Willie E. Sims Jr., assistant director of the Dade County office of black affairs. "When things get hot, people go back to those they're comfortable with."
Mr. Crespo, in a response in The Miami Times to his critics, insisted on claiming ownership of two cultures.
"What may I ask you authenticates one's blackness?," he wrote in a letter to the editor. "Is it that tired age-old debate of skin color? If so, I'm chocolate brown. Is it if one's ancestors were slaves? If so, my great-grandfather was born a slave. Is it if one's family knows the suffering and humiliation of segregation? If so, my mother was forced off the bus in 1959.
"But really, is not this whole discussion silly?"

GRAPHIC: Photos: The conflicts involving ethnicity and race are confusing for children like Ricardo, 6, the son of Emmanuel and Luz Mery Angarica, a black Cuban and a white Colombian, who say they are raising Ricardo as "American." "I have to tell them that there are blacks in Cuba, too," said Alexis Barcelay, 25, who began his journey to the United States in 1994. An effort by Henry Crespo, a black and a Cuban, to offer himself as an ideal Miami City Commissioner met rejection from blacks and Cubans. (Photographs by Cindy Karp for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: At I.M.F.'s Urging, Romania Shelves Copter Deal

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Several years ago, Romania began lining up a $1.4 billion deal intended to please Washington: the purchase of 96 Cobra attack helicopters under an arrangement that would also give the manufacturer, Bell Helicopter Textron, an assembly plant in Eastern Europe.
Bell and American military officials had told Romania the deal was sure to impress Washington with the seriousness of Romania's bid to join the West. And it seemed to be having an effect: President Clinton praised the deal during a visit in July. 
 But since the summer began, Romania has gotten two pieces of bad news. NATO, largely at the United States' initiative, formally decided that Romania was not ready to join the alliance. And the International Monetary Fund, looking over the country's shaky economy, decided that Romania simply could not afford the helicopter deal.
Now, at the I.M.F.'s insistence, Romania has put the deal on indefinite hold, Romanian and fund officials said. This opened the way for the board of the I.M.F. to approve release of the second stage of a $430 million loan for Romania. [The loan installment was approved at a meeting in Washington on Friday.]
The way the deal was sold, and how it fell apart, offers an unusually clear look at how the two threads of American policy toward the West's new Eastern Europe allies can contradict and undermine each other.
A senior Clinton Administration official said Washington urges these countries to be fiscally prudent and meet budget targets as they remake their command economies into market economies. At the same time, he said, as part of commercial and military diplomacy in the region, the Pentagon and the State and Commerce Departments encourage American arms suppliers as they try to sell expensive equipment.
The purchase of the helicopters was to have been the first sizable military procurement in the region since the fall of Communism.
The three Eastern European countries that were admitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in July -- the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland -- have all been pressed by American companies to make sizable purchases of fighter jets. But these nations have not started serious talks with the manufacturers and are first likely to lease such planes as a cost-saving measure.
Thus, the Romanians were the closest to actually buying American equipment, even though their economy is far weaker than those of the Czechs, Hungarians or Poles.
The deal was aggressively pushed by the United States Embassy working in tandem with Bell Helicopter Textron, a division of Textron Inc., even as Treasury officials expressed reservations about the expense for Romania. The American Ambassador until July, Alfred H. Moses, said in an interview this week he had urged the Romanians a number of times to buy the helicopters for economic as well as military reasons.
In an interview, Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said he was "convinced that it is necessary to have the right equipment for the Romanian Army so that it is interoperable with NATO."
"That's why the contract was signed between the Ministry of Defense and Bell Helicopter. But the issue is the financing of the project. We are making special efforts to be within a budget deficit of 4.5 percent of G.D.P." Last year, the deficit was 13 percent of the gross domestic product, he said.
Officials of the I.M.F. who reviewed Romania's financial situation in July said they told the Romanians that they could not pay for the helicopters and keep their debt-limitation agreements with the fund.
Mr. Ciorbea's Government, which came to power last November after seven years of economic stagnation under the rule of ex-Communists, is eager to please the fund.
Faced with limited resources, Mr. Ciorbea said, priority had to go to the severely depleted health and education systems. So last month, he told Bell's chairman, Webb F. Joiner, that the sale was being delayed.
Part of the deal involved reviving an old helicopter plant at Brasov, north of here, where Bell had intended to manufacture much of each helicopter. The company had agreed to pay $50 million for a 70 percent share of the plant, where a French company has produced helicopters under license. By winning this helicopter license, Bell was effectively squeezing out the French, who had been lobbying just as hard to sell their own helicopters.
Lloyd Schoppa, a Bell vice president, told Gen. Constantin Degeratu, the Romanian Army chief of staff, the deal meant the "rebirth of the aviation industry in Romania." He said Bell was already committed to $250 million in exports from the plant. The shelving of the deal for now does not mean that talks with Bell have ended. Mr. Ciorbea said he was still seeking a solution with Bell that would get Romania equipment compatible with NATO while reviving the helicopter plant.
Bell's public affairs director, Carl Harris, said the company still believed that the American-produced helicopters would improve Romania's possibilities of joining NATO. "We've felt the Cobra buy was important because they'd become a security provider rather than a security user," Mr. Harris said of the Romanians.
And 10 days after Mr. Joiner was told that the sale could not go ahead because of the budget restrictions set by the I.M.F., he was still lobbying. He wrote a letter to Finance Minister Mircea Ciumara.
In the letter, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Joiner said that it had been a pleasure to see Mr. Ciumara at a dinner in Bucharest given by the United States charge d'affaires, Michael Einik, and that he was sending information regarding the "benefits to Romania which will accrue from the program."
"It is my understanding that you will want to use this with the I.M.F.," Mr. Joiner wrote.
Bell estimated, Mr. Joiner said, that the $1.5 billion sale would "bring $2.7 billion in economic benefits to Romania" in the forms of direct investment, technology infusion and job creation.
Asked in the interview if he believed that $2.7 billion would accrue to Romania from the deal, Mr. Ciorbea raised his eyebrows and said diplomatically, "It's a lot of money."

HEADLINE: Who Should Define HDTV?

BYLINE: By Reed E. Hundt; Reed E. Hundt is the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Congress ordered the Federal Communications Commission to give broadcasters space on the nation's airwaves that is worth billions of dollars. This is the spectrum that could be used for digital television, a new medium for broadcasting video, data or even radio.
Some broadcasters wanted to use it primarily for a single channel of so-called high definition television, which would give viewers a crystal-clear picture that, for example, shows hockey or live crowd scenes in vivid relief. 
 But now others, principally ABC Television and the Sinclair Broadcast Group -- are saying that they would rather use the spectrum to broadcast five or 10 different programs simultaneously, each with clarity at least as good as today's television, than for a single high-definition channel.
Great. Let digital broadcasters experiment with the medium. Let the market dictate what uses they come up with. But Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, has said that if broadcasters don't use the spectrum primarily or even exclusively for a single high-definition program, he might urge Congress to impose special fees on them.
Next week, the Senate Commerce Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the broadcasters' proposals to use the spectrum for purposes other than high-definition television, or HDTV. No new taxes is my answer -- not even on broadcasters who should have been required to bid for the licenses to use this spectrum instead of getting them free. The power to tax is the power to destroy, and the last thing we should do with this new technology is destroy experimentation.
In fact, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 does not require broadcasters to use the spectrum only for a single high-definition channel. That would have been not only bad economic policy, but also a constraint on speech for no reasonable purpose. Why should a broadcaster who wants to send out six new channels instead of one offering very vivid pictures be punished or limited by Government?
But the Telecommunications Act did require broadcasters to give something back for their free licenses. It wasn't sharp pictures -- the Federal Government shouldn't be in the business of making sure television pictures are as crisp as possible. Rather, it was a commitment to serve the public interest.
If Congress is really interested in browbeating broadcasters, it shouldn't be trying to get them to broadcast in high definition. Rather, Congress should require broadcasters to meet specific public interest obligations. For example, it could demand that broadcasters offer a quantifiable amount of educational television and about $400 million worth of free time for political debate so that real campaign finance reform would be possible.
Moreover, letting broadcasters send out more channels instead of just one high-definition picture is in keeping with the values of the First Amendment. More channels mean more speech, whether it is about sports, entertainment or politics.
To focus on how sharp a picture should be instead of allowing the market to work and to serve the public interest takes the debate about digital television in the wrong direction.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales and Producer Prices Up, but Modestly

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Retail sales rose in August, and producer prices increased for the first time this year. But the reports were generally in line with expectations and did little to alter perceptions that the economy continued to advance with prices in check.
"It's a solid gain in sales," said Stuart G. Hoffman of the PNC Corporation in Pittsburgh, "once again accompanied by muted inflation pressures." 
 Consumers spent $213.7 billion at retail counters and in showrooms last month, four-tenths of 1 percent more than in July, the Commerce Department estimated today. While this was slightly less than expected, analysts said this was offset by a hefty upward revision in July sales.
The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods, though posting its first increase of 1997, was driven mainly by a surge in energy prices that analysts dismissed as normal gyration. With energy and food disregarded, the index edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent, in line with the trend of core inflation over the last 12 months
Over all, the index rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the most since December's rise of five-tenths of 1 percent that was followed by an unprecedented seven consecutive declines.
The bond market rallied on today's set of figures, apparently reflecting relief that they produced no unpleasant inflationary surprises. Interest rates tumbled about one-tenth of a percentage point across a broad front as many economists and investors concluded that the already slim chance that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy at its Sept. 30 policy meeting had receded further.
"These two numbers pretty well cinch the fact that the Fed isn't going to do anything," said Irwin L. Kellner, consultant to the Chase Manhattan Bank. "Growth is moderate and inflation nonexistent."
Few economists, however, rule out a possible Fed decision to strike an anti-inflation blow at its meetings in mid-November or mid-December.
The stock market first climbed today, then skidded well into negative territory before surging after lunch to finish with a gain of more than 80 points.
But while some saw signs in today's figures of a welcome slackening of the economy, others cautioned that growth could still be running at an unsustainably rapid pace.
"It looks like it's a softer trend, but it's not," said Michael H. Strauss, chief economist at Sanwa Securities in New York. After pointing to the revision that increased July's retail sales gain to nine-tenths of 1 percent from six-tenths of 1 percent, he predicted a similar result for August.
"It's not where the numbers start out, it's where they end up," Mr. Strauss said, contending that gasoline, food and apparel were probably all undercounted in today's estimate based on a small sample of the department's respondents.
Durable goods, those designed to last at least three years, posted a seven-tenths of 1 percent sales increase last month, with gains of about that much for automotive dealers, for merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes and for those selling furniture and other home equipment.
The larger nondurables category was less vigorous, with food stores reporting two-tenths of 1 percent less revenue and the drugstore and restaurant categories showing only slender increases. Clothing stores and those selling general merchandise gained six-tenths of 1 percent each while gasoline service stations posted a five-tenths of 1 percent rise, much of it reflecting higher prices.
Last month's total retail sales, which account for about one-third of economic activity, were 5.3 percent higher than in August 1996 with no allowance made for inflation.
Some analysts guessed that the 15-day United Parcel Service strike, which began on Aug. 4, trimmed sales for the month by perhaps one-tenth of a point because of an inability of some stores to restock depleted shelves or to ship merchandise. Mail-order results, for which reporting lags by a month, were not included.
The rise in the Producer Price Index was dominated by a 1.4 percent jump in the cost of energy but food prices also contributed by rising three-tenths of 1 percent.
Gasoline rose 5.9 percent, beef and veal 3.3 percent and fresh and dry vegetables 17.5 percent; by contrast, the price of eggs dropped 8.9 percent after soaring 21.7 percent in July.
Analysts found little to fret about in the prices of goods at the intermediate stage of production or in raw materials. Intermediate goods like paperboard edged up one-tenth of 1 percent. The price of crude goods rose seven-tenths of 1 percent after a small July decline, the most prominent change being an 18.5 percent surge for wastepaper.

HEADLINE: Down but Not Out, Clearly Down Under;
Lean Times at an Australian Mainstay

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: PERTH, Australia, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Write-offs of more than $1 billion over the last two years. Sagging earnings and stockholder equity. Huge cost overruns at a much heralded iron ore processing plant here in mineral-rich Western Australia and a troubled copper investment in the United States. Three resignations of senior executives. And a chairman who acknowledges he is "ashamed" and "a bit flabbergasted" by it all.
For the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the sprawling mining empire known for much of its 112 years as the "Big Australian," it has been a time of big disappointment -- and of an equally broad reassessment. 
 As an icon of an Australian economy in transition, not to mention the country's biggest company, Broken Hill has come under intense fire from the financial press, analysts and academics.
"Companies of the size of B.H.P. should be able to avoid such large mistakes," said Andre Morkel, a professor of management at the University of Western Australia. "We in Australia have to learn to be more professional in our management, up our game."
All commodity producers have taken their lumps adjusting to a period of low inflation, plentiful supplies and lackluster demand. But B.H.P., based in Melbourne, has been battered more than most by its delayed reaction to the arrival of the global economy.
"Globalization has put pressure on everybody," said Neil Goodwill, an analyst at J. B. Were & Company, a Melbourne investment house. "At B.H.P., they realize they have to get leaner and meaner, but have been a little slower to act than most."
One reason may be that the company's icon status in Australia has made Broken Hill less ruthless than its competitors. Its labor contracts, for example, are generally seen as the most generous in the industry.
But a bigger reason is that B.H.P., long sheltered by the barrier reefs of high tariffs, used to have little to worry about. Because of its protected home market and strong asset base -- in addition to iron, it produces oil, coal, copper, manganese and other commodities -- B.H.P. had become complacent, in the view of some, particularly when compared with the aggressiveness of many other Australian companies, notably those in media, information technology and medical research.
Julian Stock, chairman of the Melbourne branch of the Australian Shareholders Association, faults a "highly centralized bureaucratic management, no flexibility and cradle-to-grave jobs."
Now, however, the Big Australian, which also makes steel and is moving into a variety of business services, is feeling the gales of competition like everyone else -- and is starting to take the harsh actions that have long gone against its grain.
Rising imports due to lower steel tariffs, for example, were a factor behind a B.H.P. decision last April to shut down primary steel production in the east coast town of Newcastle, provoking an outcry from labor and community leaders.
"It is no longer business as usual at B.H.P.," said John B. Prescott, the company's managing director and chief executive.
There is little choice, what with all the harsh new realities.
Indeed, given the new low inflation environment, "no longer is it possible to simply produce commodities and collect an inflation windfall," said Frank Harman, senior lecturer in economics at Perth's Murdoch University.
Then, too, there is increased competition from rival suppliers, such as Indonesia, which is emerging as a major coal exporter and is closer to Asian customers than Australia.
"Even though some markets, especially in Asia, have been expanding," Mr. Harman said, "you have to work harder to participate and maintain market share."
But B.H.P. has to work harder as well because of declining prices. Thanks to new supplies and weak demand, world prices of coal and iron ore are half the levels of the early 1980's.
Copper is more volatile. Since June, prices have fallen about 20 cents a pound. B.H.P. says every cent per pound affects its annual after-tax profit by $13 million. So if the 20-cent reduction remains for the full fiscal year, which ends next May 31, the company would give up $260 million in earnings, an amount that would represent 85 percent of last year's net profits of $313 million.
For all its difficulties, some observers think the company is learning from its mistakes and will rebound in the not-too-distant future.
"We believe management is very serious about changing its approach," said Elaine Prior, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Sydney. "The path ahead may not be smooth. The new B.H.P. may be a less comfortable place to work than in the past. New skills will be required."
Indeed, she expects the share price to rise 20 percent over the next 12 months, and has just termed the stock a "long-term buy."
The Big Australian started as a miner of silver, lead and zinc at Broken Hill, New South Wales. Today, it is one of the globe's corporate behemoths, with 61,000 employees in 90-odd business units in 70 countries. With sales last year of $16 billion and total assets of $28 billion, it ranks as the world's second-biggest producer of iron ore (behind Brazil's recently privatized Companhia Vale do Rio Doce) and copper (behind Chile's state-owned Codelco). It is the 3d- biggest producer of manganese, 7th of coal, 14th of steel and 18th of oil and gas.
But to maintain that size, the company has had to look farther and farther afield. In January 1996, it bought Magma Copper of Tucson, Ariz. It already owned the big Escondida copper mine in northern Chile. It mines coal in New Mexico and Indonesia, pumps oil from the Gulf of Mexico, extracts titanium from Mozambique. Next year, it will begin production from Canada's first diamond mine, in the Northwest Territories near Yellowknife.
Forty percent of what B.H.P. sells is produced overseas and sold overseas, 30 percent produced in Australia and sold overseas and 30 percent produced and sold in Australia.
Despite all the growth overseas, return on equity has slipped to half the rate of the early 1990's. Profits and gross profit margins are at the lowest levels in a decade.
The huge write-downs of B.H.P.'s asset portfolio, including $420 million on the $2.4 billion purchase of Magma Copper, suggest that all those years as the great icon of Australian business may have led the company to drop its guard.
In the case of Magma, Australia's biggest international takeover, B.H.P. acknowledged with embarrassment the breakdown of the "due diligence" process under which proposed acquisitions are appraised within the company.
B.H.P. executives insist they have taken remedial action, including the hiring of a former Union Bank of Switzerland executive in New York, Anna Lou Fletcher, as manager of financial planning and analysis, to vet such decisions in the future.
The write-down followed what B.H.P.'s chairman, Jeremy K. Ellis, called a "misunderstanding of the resources at one of the mines," in Nevada.
"Magma was a public company and there is only so much due diligence you can do," he said, "and most of it is bookwork and paperwork behind closed doors." He defended the purchase for broadening the company's base in copper and giving it "the best smelter in the world."
Mr. Ellis, who was elevated to chairman earlier this year, had been chief executive of the B.H.P. minerals group and was chiefly responsible for the acquisition.
"Of course, it's not a great joy to see us having to do these write-offs," he recently told a group of shareholders. "I didn't choose an easy life obviously."
But even as the business community was evaluating the depressing effects of the Magma write-down and others on the fiscal year ended last May 31, B.H.P. faced new troubles: delays and large cost overruns at the iron ore processing plant under construction at Port Hedland, about 1,000 miles north of Perth.
That plant, in the heart of Western Australia's iron ore country, is to produce 2.5 million tons a year of hot briquetted iron for use by electric arc steel mills around the world. Initially it was to cost $1 billion. Now the company concedes the cost will be closer to $1.5 billion.
Analysts are critical of a breakdown in communications that apparently left headquarters in Melbourne unaware of the magnitude of the overrun until early last month. The new head of the minerals division, Richard J. Carter, and the head of the division's iron ore unit, Geoffrey L. W. Wedlock, were suddenly forced to resign. They have declined all comment.
"Why wasn't the information forthcoming to the managing director, to the internal auditors, to other parts of the management team who were obviously looking at this?" asked Ross Greenwood, editor of Business Review Weekly, the Australian equivalent of Business Week.
The managing director, Mr. Prescott, tried to explain: "We were given all sorts of assurances. There's not time in these sorts of affairs to go into all of that, but we had detailed arrangements. We put great focus on monitoring this particular project and what we've seen is a breakdown in those arrangements."
Engineering difficulties, problems with some of the components built overseas and high labor costs are among the factors blamed.
Adding to the sense of disarray was the resignation of a third senior executive, John J. O'Connor, executive general manager of the petroleum group.
He argued that stockholders would be better served if the much better performing petroleum assets were turned into a separate company, much as stockholder benefits have accrued in the United States from the splitting off of Lucent and NCR from AT&T.
The board thought otherwise. "It is quite clear to us that the company as a whole has more value than the sum of its parts," Mr. Prescott declared.
The asset write-downs, cost overruns and public disagreements in the executive suite suggest to many outsiders a management in chaos.
Stockholders are "bloody furious" over recent events, said Mr. Stock of the Australian Shareholders Association. The company's share price now fluctuates around a dollar above its low for the year and is at the same level as at the start of 1994.
Both Mr. Prescott and Mr. Ellis insist they have taken the steps for rehabilitation, including commitments for greater accountability and improved returns on capital.
The company's performance, for example, is to be measured against that of other companies in the same sector. And a greater share of compensation at the top is going to be tied to that performance.
"We have put more of our senior managers' salary at risk," Mr. Prescott said.

GRAPHIC: Charts: "Broken Hill's Bottom Line"
Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Australia's giant producer of basic commodities, has been slow to respond to the increased competition of the global economy. While other producers have suffered from low inflation, plentiful supplies and lackluster demand, B.H.P. has compounded its difficulties by, for example, cost overruns at its new iron ore processing plant and a huge write-off for an ill-timed investment in Magma, a copper mine in Tucson, Ariz.

"BIG AUSTRALIAN'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS"
 
COST OVERRUNS
An iron ore processing plant under construction at Port Hedland in Western Australia was to cost $1 billion. Now the company concedes it will be closer to $1.5 billion.
 
MINERALS DIVISION
Profits from B.H.P.'s minerals division have been hit by lower iron ore prices and delays at its iron ore processing plant under construction in Port
Hedland.
 
COPPER DIVISION
Lower prices have affected profits from B.H.P.'s copper division, with the biggest hit coming from a $420 million write-off on its purchase of Magma Copper.

Stocks Rebound Strongly On Economic Reports
The stock market regained some of the ground it lost in the previous two trading sessions, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 81.99 points, or 1.07 percent, to 7,742.97. After faltering a bit in the last few days, smaller stocks continued to climb. 
 One of the stocks that helped buoy the market was Motorola, which rebounded slightly after a big drop the day before, when the company issued a warning of lower-than-expected earnings. [Page 37.]
 
Bonds Up for First Time in 4 Days
Bond prices rallied strongly, the first gain in four days, after tame reports on producer prices and retail sales for August suggested that the Federal Reserve might not need to raise interest rates this month. The yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to 6.58 percent, from 6.69 percent. [36.]
 
Times Mirror Chief Adds a Title
Mark H. Willes, the chairman, president and chief executive of Times Mirror, became the publisher of the company's flagship newspaper, The Los Angeles Times. He replaces Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, who resigned. Mr. Schlosberg had wanted the chairmanship when Mr. Willes was hired for that post from General Mills two summers ago. [36.]
 
China Plans Economic Changes
President Jiang Zemin embraced a program of bold transformation for China's ailing state-owned industries as he opened the 15th Communist Party Congress. Among his proposals was the privatization of the majority of China's 13,000 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, as well as most of its 300,000 smaller companies. [7.]
 
Thermo King Sale Expected
An announcement about the sale of Westinghouse Electric's Thermo King unit, which makes refrigeration equipment, could be made as early as Monday. Several companies have been mentioned as possible buyers, including Emerson Electric. [44.]
 
American General in Acquisition
American General has agreed to buy the 55 percent of Western National that it does not already own for $1.2 billion in cash and stock. The deal will make American General the third-largest provider of annuities in the United States. [36.]
 
Insider Trading Charge at Morgan
Federal authorities arrested a 25-year-old junior analyst at J. P. Morgan and charged him with insider trading. The Government said he had made illegal profits of more than $350,000 over a two-month period. [36.]
 
A Strong Coffee Supply Cuts Prices
Coffee prices declined more than 8 percent as supplies flooded into exchange warehouses, a sign that roasters are well stocked at the start of the season of peak demand. Stockpiles in the warehouses stood at 93,682 bags, more than double levels a year earlier. The Green Coffee Association is expected to report on Monday that supplies during August rose as much as 300,000 bags from the 2.335 million at the end of July. [45.]
 
Romania Shelves Helicopter Deal
A $1.4 billion deal by Romania to purchase 96 Cobra attack helicopters from Bell Helicopter and to give the company an assembly plant in Eastern Europe has been put on hold. One of the reasons is that the International Monetary Fund, looking over the country's shaky economy, decided that Romania simply could not afford the helicopters. [3.]
 
Lee Reduces Its Offer for Fisher
The Thomas H. Lee Companies has reduced its offer for Fisher Scientific International to $48.25 a share, from $51, because the scientific instruments maker's profit and market share had diminished as a result of the strike at United Parcel Service. Fisher Scientific said it would accept the reduced offer, which values its stock at about $980 million. [37.]

HEADLINE: 81.99 Rebound in Blue Chips Recoups Part of Week's Loss

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The stock market regained some of the ground it lost in the previous two trading sessions, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 1 percent yesterday. Economic reports indicating that growth remained moderate and inflation tame in August tempered some investor concerns about possible third-quarter earnings disappointments.
Drug stocks like Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Merck were among the issues leading the rebound. In addition, Motorola, whose stock fell more than 8 points in after-hours trading on Thursday, finished higher after a conference call held by the company brightened investor outlook. 
 The Dow soared 81.99 points, to 7,742.97, a 1.07 percent gain, erasing part of the 190.93 it lost the previous two sessions. The blue-chip index was off 79.44 for the week, however.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks added 11.32 points, closing at 923.91, a gain of 1.24 percent.
On the Big Board, gains outnumbered declines more than 5 to 2.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 9.47, finishing at 1,649.33. the technology-laden index is now 6.89 points away from its high close reached on Sept. 9.
After faltering a bit in previous sessions, smaller stocks continued to climb. The Russell 2000 gained 4.16, hitting a closing high of 440.09.
Early in the session, Treasury securities and stocks gained strength from economic reports on retail sales and producer prices. According to the data, prices paid to producers in the United States rose three-tenths of 1 percent in August. The increase, the first after seven consecutive declines, met expectations.
Meanwhile, retail sales rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August, less than the seven-tenths of 1 percent that had been forecast by economists. Analysts said this moderate growth with low inflation suggested that the Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates at its next policy-making meeting on Sept. 30.
But stocks quickly retreated, and the Dow fell as much as 52 points because of concerns about third-quarter earnings, said Jim Benning, a vice president at BT Brokerage.
Shortly before noon, stocks turned higher. But they picked up most of their gains late in the session, aided by some computer-generated buy programs, analysts said.
"There was nothing new that hit the market in the last hour," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Zurich Kemper Investments. "It was just buying on the dip."
Ascend Communications was the most-active issue, with 20.9 million shares changing hands. Falling for the second consecutive day, Ascend closed at 35 1/4, down 2 9/16, amid concerns the company may not meet third-quarter earnings forecasts.
Motorola closed at 69 3/16, up 3 5/16. After the market closed on Thursday, Motorola announced that third-quarter earnings would fall below expectations, hurt by weak sales of pagers in the the world's largest markets, the United States and China, and one-time costs.
But during an early morning conference call with investors and analysts yesterday, Motorola gave the impression that its problems were "localized" within two areas and that its other business operations were performing well, said Jack Geraghty, a semiconductor analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
"The longer-term view could be that this is a glitch along the road," he said. Although Mr. Geraghty said the long-term prospects for the company seemed good, he lowered his 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates.
Procter & Gamble led the Dow higher, closing at 133 1/2, up 2.
Among drug stocks, Pfizer gained 2 15/16, to 58 3/16; Lilly rose 4 3/8, to 108 7/16, and Merck added 7/16, to 92 13/16. Also, Warner-Lambert picked up 5 1/4, to close at 133. On Thursday, Warner's chief executive said the company expected to meet analysts' 1998 forecasts as well as see double-digit earnings growth in 1997 because of strong new products.

Albright's Mideast Visit Ends With Little Gained
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, with undiplomatic bluntness, said she would not return to the Middle East until Israeli and Palestinian leaders had made what she called "the hard decisions." 1
 
Palestinians in the West Bank were as frustrated with Ms. Albright's visit as she is herself. 6 

Funeral for Mother Teresa
The state and military honors at the funeral today of Mother Teresa in Calcutta, her adopted city, were unrivaled in the funeral of any unranked or untitled Indian since Mohandas Gandhi. Shrines to the Albanian-born nun who preached selflessness -- do "something beautiful for God" -- are cropping up on street corners. 1
 
Intimidation in Argentina
In a vicious reminder of the atrocities of the 1970's in Argentina, a former Navy captain who admitted to torture during the military regime said four attackers slashed his face and warned him to stop speaking with journalists. 1
 
Zapatistas March in Mexico
About 1,100 unarmed Zapatista militants from Chiapas arrived in Mexico City after a six-day march protesting the Government's failure to reach a peace agreement with them. "They didn't defeat us. We didn't sell out," one rebel told sympathetic students and poor people. Wearing the masks they popularized during their brief but dramatic uprising in January of 1994, they hope to draw attention to the plight of the Indians. 4
 
Romania Arms Deal Evaporates
A $1.4 billion deal for Romania to acquire 96 attack helicopters from an American company, a deal praised by President Clinton during a visit to Bucharest last July, has fallen apart. Enthusiasm had waned in Romania since it was denied NATO membership, and the International Monetary Fund used pressure on a $430 million loan to argue that health and education were more pressing concerns for the battered economy. 3
 
Chechnya Pipeline Tug-of-War
An agreement announced Tuesday to rebuild a key oil pipeline crossing through Russia and the secessionist republic of Chechnya did not survive the week as Russia threatened to pull out after a bomb attack on some repair workers. Vitriolic insults and threats have since flown back and forth, and Russia announced plans to build a pipeline via another route to ship oil from an $8 billion project in Azerbaijan to the Black Sea. 6
 
Party Congress Begins in China
President Jiang Zemin opened China's 15th Communist Party congress with a two-and-a-half hour speech riven with socialist lingo that almost obscured his plan to sell off most of China's state-owned enterprises. Economic reforms notwithstanding, Mr. Jiang emphasized that the party will retain its monopoly on China's political structure. 7

Gore Finds Himself In Inquiry's Spotlight
The storm over his campaign finance practices has thrust Vice President Al Gore into what his advisers concede is by far the most perilous moment of his political career, leaving his aides scrambling to contain the damage. The growing nervousness results from the announcement last week that Janet Reno, the Attorney General, is reviewing whether the fund-raising activities may have been improper for such a high-ranking official. The inquiry could lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor. 1
 
A Nonhearing on Weld
Senator Jesse Helms asserted his power as a committee chairman and refused to hold a hearing over the nomination of William F. Weld to be Ambassador to Mexico. President Clinton declared the battle "not over" and said he would urge Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, to bring the nomination to the floor for a vote. Some senators were contemplating a move to galvanize public pressure on Mr. Lott to do just that. 1
 
B-2 Confronts a New Enemy
Once heralded as the ultimate Cold War weapon, a radar-evading bomber capable of attacking deep inside the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons, the B-2 is confronted with a different, unforeseen enemy: a coalition of government auditors, members of Congress and arms-control advocates. 9
 
Black and Cuban in Miami
Black Cuban-Americans in Miami find themselves living between two worlds. As Cubans they belong to an immigrant group that has enjoyed tremendous economic and political success. But as blacks they have experienced the discrimination and hardships of their race. And they remain virtually invisible in the city's power structure -- even though they are more representative of an island where half or more of the population is now estimated to be black or mulatto. 8
 
Mars Ship in Ideal Orbit
Early tracking data show that the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft hit a veritable bull's-eye when it rocketed into an orbit of Mars on Thursday night, officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said. The 1,700-pound Surveyor, launched last November from Cape Canaveral, Fla., is the second American spacecraft to reach Mars this year to start a 10-year campaign of exploration leading up to a return of Mars rocks. 11
 
Jeb Bush Tries Again in Florida
Three years after losing Florida's closest gubernatorial election ever, Jeb Bush, son of former President George Bush, filed as a Republican candidate for governor. Mr. Bush, a real estate developer from Miami, lost the 1994 governor's race to the incumbent Democrat, Lawton Chiles, by 80,000 votes out of 4.2 million cast. His elder brother, George W. Bush, won the governorship of Texas on the same day. (Reuters)

Therapists Help Patients Cope With Diana's Death
Therapists in New York City and its suburbs report that a number of their female patients have sought counseling in how to deal with the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales. The patients were stunned by the power of their reaction to her death and dismayed that the men in their life hadn't a clue what so moved them, the therapists said. 1
 
Comptroller Opposes Sharpton
City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, one of New York City's most influential Democrats, said he would not support the Rev. Al Sharpton if he won the Mayoral nomination. Mr. Hevesi cited what he described as Mr. Sharpton's "willingness to tolerance the bigotry" of Louis Farrakhan and a city college professor who made racist and anti-Semitic remarks. 25
 
Ferry Riders Fear Cutbacks
A series of breakdowns on the Staten Island ferry that have happened in the two months since the 50-cent charge to ride it was abolished with great fanfare has led many of the 27,000 daily passengers to get a sinking feeling that, these days, they are getting what they pay for. 25
 
Library Benefactor Revealed
For two years it has been among the best-kept secrets in New York philanthropy. Only two people at the New York Public Library knew the identity of the donor who in 1995 pledged $15 million -- the largest single gift in the institution's history -- to renovate the Main Reading Room, the heart of the library. Now, the name can be told: Frederick P. Rose, the real estate developer, and his wife, Sandra. 25

Insurer to Cut Costs
The Prudential Life Insurance Company plans to squeeze $250 million to $500 million in annual savings from the company's big, money-losing health insurance unit, Prudential executives said.

Convention Hall Is Planned

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD

 BODY:
A 72,000-square-foot convention hall will be built on the beach in Wildwood and will replace a hall that was built in 1971, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday.
The $60 million project will be financed by $10 million in low-interest loans from the state's Economic Development Authority and $20 million from Wildwood's 2 percent tourism tax. 
 The Sports and Exposition Authority will pay the balance and operate the convention hall. The authority also operates the Atlantic City Convention Center.
The hall should be completed by 1999, officials said.

HEADLINE: Bonds Break Out of Slump After Tame Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Bond prices rallied strongly yesterday, the first gain in four days, after tame reports on producer prices and retail sales for August suggested that the Federal Reserve might not need to raise interest rates this month to slow the economy.
The 30-year Treasury bond gained 1 10/32, to a price of 97 10/32, pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 6.58 percent, from 6.69 percent on Thursday. For bondholders, the day's gain amounted to about $13.13 for $1,000 invested. 
 The Labor Department reported that producer prices rose three-tenths of a percent and one-tenth of a percent when volatile food and energy prices are excluded. Both figures were within expectations, and were "not exactly a harbinger of an imminent upturn in inflation," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, a Canadian firm.
Retail sales for August were another pleasant surprise for the bond market, rising four-tenths of 1 percent instead of the expected increase of seven-tenths of a percent.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "Unequivocal euphoria is the best way I can describe what the mood of the market was like after investors read the results of both the P.P.I. and the retail sales reports."
He said that while the reports did not eliminate the possibility of an increase in interest rates by the Fed, they made it likely that any such move would come later rather than sooner.
Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management, was not surprised by yesterday's gains. "We have gotten past big numbers," he said, adding that economic reports next week could cause some problems, but were not being awaited with the same fears as yesterday's data.
Also yesterday, Argentina, in its largest debt sale ever, sold $2.25 billion of 30-year bonds in an effort to repurchase Brady bonds outstanding. The new issue will now be the country's longest-maturity bond, according to Government officials.
On Thursday, Venezuela took advantage of robust demand for high- yielding securities to sell $4 billion of its 30-year bonds. Investors paid for most of the issue by swapping Brady bonds.
The new Argentine global bonds, whose sale is being managed by J. P. Morgan & Company, were given a 9.75 percent coupon and priced to yield 305 basis points more than a United States Treasury security with a similar maturity. Investors paid for about 75 percent of the new bonds by swapping Brady bonds.

Dollar Weaker vs. Mark
By The Associated Press
The dollar tumbled for a second day yesterday, to its lowest level against the mark since early July, weakening on speculation that the German central bank would raise interest rates soon.
But the dollar continued to rise against the yen, reflecting both the weakness of the Japanese economy and traders' desire to sell yen for the German currency.

Tip of the Iceberg

BYLINE: By Holly Brubach 

 BODY:
Economists assure us that the inflation rate is now near zero and holding steady, and we might be inclined to believe them, if we ate iceberg lettuce. For those who do, it's true that the price of a salad has indeed remained constant over the course of the past 10 years. But here is where hidden inflation comes into play: For those of us who have left iceberg behind, the price of a salad has increased exponentially. There was a time when we subscribed to lettuces like Boston and bibb, but before long they were supplanted by other breeds of greens, each more exotic than the one before, and more expensive. First there was arugula, then radicchio, followed by mache and, more recently, mesclun -- each of which made its debut as a delicacy at the top of the charts and has since sunk to the level of ubiquity. It was frisee that ousted mesclun, precipitating its decline, and now mizuna, an upstart salad green from Asia, with darling pointy leaves and a bitter peppery taste, has gone frisee one better. Anyone whose appetite has followed this trajectory from iceberg (stable at an average of $1.19 a pound at D'Agostino) to mizuna (currently $9 a pound at Balducci's) has in effect experienced a 656 percent increase in the cost of a salad. 
 Godiva chocolates, formerly considered the gold standard ($32 for a 1-pound box of truffles), have been topped in status value by Teuscher ($49 a pound): 54 percent inflation. The Jeep Explorer (starting at $28,000 for the standard model) gave way to the Range Rover ($56,000, leather upholstery), which in turn has given way to the paramilitary Hummer ($90,000 with a tire-inflation system): 221 percent inflation. The Viking stove ($3,263 for the 36-inch stainless-steel model, four burners) was outclassed by the Aga ($10,000 -- four ovens, built in Shropshire, England) and La Cornue ($14,800 -- two ovens and two warmers), both of which have been superseded by the Bonnet ($400,000 -- custom-made by hand in France in solid cast iron with an installer flown over to assemble it on site): 12,159 percent inflation.
It's so expensive being rich," Susan Gutfreund once said. And we know what she means, having experienced the hardships of hidden inflation.

HEADLINE: Reveille In New York

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman; Clyde Haberman writes the NYC column for The Times.

 BODY:
The language of New York early in the morning is Spanish. Chinese runs a close second. That is not to say you can't get by nicely in other languages, even English. But at the ungodly hour of 5:30 A.M., the people who keep the city moving tend to be its most recent arrivals, hard-working immigrants without many alternatives.
Perhaps this is a good time for full disclosure. I hate the early morning. I spent two years in the Army trying unsuccessfully to get them to start reveille without me, and the following 27 years have produced no change in atttitude. My eyelids may flutter somewhere around 7 A.M., but the brain doesn't usually kick into gear until closer to noon. 
 So it was an adventure to roam New York at 5:30 A.M., and a shock to see how many people were up and about at that hour. I had expected a nearly empty train as I took the subway downtown to the Fulton Fish Market. Instead, most seats were filled, in the main with young and middle-aged men trying to squeeze a bit more sleep out of the night or talking quietly to one another. Many were on their way to jobs in food markets and diners, places that need time to get rolling before the first customers show up. Spanish and Chinese filled the air, with virtually the only English coming from the conductor announcing the stops.
A few of those workers got off the train with me at the Fulton Street station. I had gone there because of the fish market, centered at the foot of Fulton Street on the East River. It is a great place to start a New York day, particularly if you are a jet-lagged traveler who can't sleep anyway.
There are, you should know, several large markets in Manhattan that get under way as early as 7 or 8 A.M. and are worth visiting. The stretch of 28th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, for example, is the heart of the flower district, where you can walk from one overheated store to another taking in the dizzying scents and colors. But the king of New York markets is the Fulton Fish Market, where a 5:30 A.M. arrival on a weekday is already on the late side. The place has been in full swing for well over an hour.
 But "it's not what it used to be," admitted a vendor who has operated a food cart along the East River for years, selling breakfast fare ranging from Chinese noodles to French toast. "The prices for fish are high," he said, "and you don't see the business that you used to."
 Still, Fulton is an eyeful, an admirable survivor through many decades. It has even withstood the assaults of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former Federal prosecutor, who vowed to rid it of an alleged mob influence that, frankly, made it all the more exotic to some visitors (perhaps because they wanted to see the source of the fish that Luca Brasi, the Godfather's enforcer, slept with).
 You need to watch your step on South Street, the market's central thoroughfare. If you're not careful, you can be hit from behind by forklifts carrying crates of fish. The pavement is slippery with water and blood. Embers float in the air, from the fires that workers keep alive in metal barrels to ward off predawn chills that can slice into them even in spring and summer.
 On this particular morning, many in the market were Koreans, major wholesale buyers of fish in New York these days. They walked with expert eyes through a giant shed by the river, its stalls filled with tuna, cod and swordfish.
 After making their purchases, they went for breakfast at the handful of nearby restaurants open at that odd hour. Some headed to the Market Bar and Grill on Peck Slip, which was serving bean soup. Many more walked around the corner to a restaurant at Front and Beekman Streets called San, which means mountain in Korean. The dominant smells were of hearty, garlicky Korean soups that had been coming out of the kitchen since 3 A.M. But there was also coffee, thank goodness, for someone whose stomach was not up to kimchi at that hour.
 By then, dawn was breaking over the East River, a pink early light poking through the spidery lacing of the Brooklyn Bridge, which looms over the market. It's one of the great man-made wonders, that bridge, easily reached by walking a few blocks to the footpath that ends near City Hall.
 Maybe a better place to watch the sun rise over New York would be the top of the Empire State Building or the observation tower at the World Trade Center. Better, but unfortunately not doable. Neither skyscraper opens to the public until 9:30 A.M., leaving few places to watch the dawn unobstructed by waterfront buildings on the Brooklyn and Queens side of the East River.
 So the Brooklyn Bridge wins by default. And you can do a lot worse. The world-famous steel suspension bridge, opened in 1883, was once hailed by the critic Lewis Mumford as "perhaps the most completely satisfying structure of any kind" to have been built in America. An endless flow of automobile traffic has somewhat dimmed the allure, but a well-used footpath keeps the bridge people-friendly. Even at dawn, it is alive with pedestrians, mostly Brooklynites slogging into Manhattan for work, briefcases in hand.
 Wall Street is just a few blocks south, and even at that hour it is starting to come alive. By 7 A.M., it is shifting into high button-down gear, many of these masters of the universe having already pummeled themselves into shape with workouts at health centers like New York Sports Clubs, cater-cornered from the New York Stock Exchange at Wall and Broad.
 That's an entire subculture of the New York morning: keeping fit. In fact, it's an obsession. Almost as important as staying in shape, it seems, is making sure that everyone else knows how hard you are working at it. New York Sports Clubs, for example, is at sidewalk level, its windows large enough so that passersby can stand on the street admiring these paragons of higher commitment.
 Much farther uptown, sunrise over New York reveals men and women running by the hundreds around the Central Park Reservoir in parodies of underwear. Many have Walkmen on their heads to shut out the world -- God forbid they should have contact with quotidian life. If they are not running in circles around the reservoir, they're pounding along the city pavement, doing little dances at street corners while waiting for traffic lights to change. At Chelsea Piers, a sports complex on the Hudson River at West 23d Street, golfers can smack balls toward New Jersey as early as 5 A.M. in the summer. In the winter, one group of mainly women works out on Wednesday mornings at the American Museum of Natural History on Central Park West, which opens its doors to members at 7 A.M.: Jurassic gymnasts doing their jumping jacks and power walks by the dinosaur skeletons.
 And you'd better believe that they are running on Wall Street, home of the rat race.
 At 7:15 A.M., the bankers and brokers, the secretaries and mailroom clerks pour out of the IRT subway stop at Broadway and Wall, and stream into the financial district. A few -- very few, I have to say -- stop first at Trinity Church, which is also at Broadway and Wall.
 It is tempting to be cynical. Are these people praying for Divine guidance before going off to make a killing?
 What may be tempting, however, is not fair. God and Mammon have coexisted in the vicinity of Broadway and Wall for more than 150 years. For visitor and native alike, Trinity Church provides a much-needed reflective beginning to the whirligig that is New York's workday.
 Of course, Trinity is hardly the only house of worship open for morning prayers, a category, by the way, that goes beyond churches. This is New York, after all. Don't forget the many synagogues and, increasingly, mosques like the large Islamic Cultural Center at Third Avenue and East 96th Street. But Trinity not only offers a spiritual start to the day but it also is a symbol of New York's roots. That part of Manhattan was the original city. This is actually the third Trinity Church, the first one, completed in 1698, having burned and second having collapsed after a heavy snowfall. This version opened its doors in 1846, an elegant structure that stands as a quiet reminder of how relatively new the skyscrapers that define New York are.
 It can be a jolt to step out of the church at 7:45 and back into the hubbub of Wall Street, whose pace by then has grown only more frantic. But is there a better metaphor for New York's fast pace than Grand Central Terminal (often imperfectly rendered as Grand Central Station)? Between roughly 8 and 8:45 A.M., the Grand Central stop on the IRT subway line is as close as you can get to organized chaos outside a rugby scrum. It is not a pretty sight. But to see how commuting New York starts its day, it is the place to be. Just make sure you stand off to the side to keep from being swept up by the human tide.
 Several months ago, Grand Central was the laboratory for a grand experiment in behavior modification. New Yorkers, you soon discover, are not a conspicuously orderly tribe. On subway platforms, people like to plow into trains before passengers already on board can get off. The results are pileups and delays all along the line.
 Aha! said the Transit Authority, the subway system's manager. Let's see if we can enable one group to leave the train before another pushes in. To enforce discipline, the authority put 30 or so uniformed workers on the Grand Central platform, one at each train door, shooing encroachers away until passengers could get off. It worked. New Yorkers behaved themselves, and order reigned. For the weeks of the experiment, that is. Did things run so smoothly after the experiment ended and the uniforms disappeared? Permit me a New Yorker's right to answer a question with another question. What do you think?
 After half an hour of this underground punishment, you may be ready for fresh air.
 Rockefeller Center is not far away on foot. There, on West 49th Street, you will find dozens of visitors to the city, drawn to the curbside studios of NBC and the "Today" show. Every morning on the hour and half-hour, the "Today" personalities go out on the street and chat briefly with the people, a scene that is beamed live across the United States. That explains why many of these folks, presumably sensible enough back home, do strange things after landing in New York, decking themselves out as London buskers or giant bunnies while holding up signs for the cameras like "Hi Mom, Dad, Suz!"
 One morning at 8, I asked a young couple from Sacramento, Calif., why they were there. Because, they said, they had awakened at 5 A.M. -- 5 A.M. -- to get standby tickets for the Rosie O'Donnell show at the NBC studios. As it turned out, Ms. O'Donnell was not taping that week. So after a quick studio tour by a gracious NBC guide, they hung around to glimpse the weatherman Al Roker and smile at the cameras.
 Oh well, why not? The only point here is that it isn't most New Yorkers' cup of cappuccino.
 Speaking of which, isn't it time for a real breakfast?
 In truth, many working New Yorkers, perhaps most, eat breakfast on the run. What else? A typical routine is to stop at a curbside wagon on the walk between subway and office, and to buy a coffee and a bagel with a shmeer. Shmeer is not as horrible as it may sound. It's a spread of cream cheese, smeared across the bagel. Somewhere along the line, it became shmeer, a Yiddish word that in another context also means bribe. But that's another story. It is mentioned here only to note that without a knowledge of certain Yiddish words -- many of which, for some reason, begin with the "sch" sound -- communication with New Yorkers can be limited.
 It is possible to eat breakfast sitting down, of course. Diners abound, many owned by Greek immigrants and their children. A hot place in this category is Tom's Restaurant, a crowded joint at the northeast corner of Broadway and West 112th Street. Its main distinction for some visitors, other than its proximity to Columbia University, is that it is a fixture on "Seinfeld." You know the diner on the show, where all you see from outside is the word "restaurant" in neon? That's Tom's, though the cramped interior looks nothing like the place where Jerry and his friends shmooze -- another New York word derived from Yiddish, meaning to gab.
 Tom's fare is solid enough. But if you want to see where the elite meet to eat, you must go to the Regency Hotel, on Park Avenue at East 61st Street.
 For $22.50, not including tax and tip, you can get the same bacon and eggs (plus a few frills) that cost $3.35 at a place like Tom's. But the important thing at the Regency is not to eat but to be seen among the Trumps and Tisches. The movers and shakers don't eat much anyway. They're in competition over who will order the least. Ask for juice and granola and you can be sure that someone at your table will go you one better, ordering only wheat germ. But for your $22.50, you do get impeccable service, in contrast to many New York diners, where the service is often highly peccable.
 My wife, Kathy, and I went to the Regency one morning and were shown to a room called The Library, where the only famous person I recognized was Gore Vidal -- and he was in a photo hanging over our table. The Library looks out onto Park Avenue and is perfectly pleasant. The power boys -- there were only a few power girls, I'm afraid -- were next door in the main room, where reservations must be made weeks in advance. Some image-conscious city commissioners, the maitre d'hotel confided, would rather be seen breakfasting in Newark than somewhere in Manhattan other than the Regency's main room.
 What's that? This is all crazy, you say? Of course, it's crazy. But when was that the issue? What can I say except that it's a New York thing?
 If food is still on your mind, the city has many stores that open as early as 8 A.M. and specialize in cheeses and sausages not available elsewhere. Take a culinary shrine like Zabar's, on Broadway at West 80th Street. It is more enjoyable at 8 A.M. than later in the day because you can really appreciate the vast arrays of food there without the usual crowds. Truth is, New Yorkers are not always fun to be around in places like Zabar's. They have a tendency to push and yell a lot, throwing any vestige of good manners to the winds.
 That brings us full circle to a basic point: this can be one hectic city. It is why the early morning is so special. New York may not be asleep at that hour. But it is not fully awake, either, and is more easily absorbed.
 To truly appreciate its grandeur, you can hardly do better than a sunrise ride on the Staten Island Ferry. Granted, the ferry terminal in Battery Park is not heaven, with all the homeless there. But you can take the 25-minute ride to Staten Island and then board the next boat back to Manhattan for free.
 At dawn, the first pink rays of the sun peek over Queens and Brooklyn, slanting across the East River and striking the glass-encased towers of lower Manhattan. On either side of you sits one of the world's great harbors. Off to the left, the Statue of Liberty's torch still burns bright in the melting darkness.
 You have to be fairly jaded not to feel your heart leap at that moment.
 
Breakfast Clubs
 
Market Bar and Grill, 40 Peck Slip (telephone: 406-2742), opens at midnight daily, except Saturdays. There is a full range of short-order specialties, including bean soup ($2.25). Conventional breakfast fare includes two eggs, any style, with toast and bacon, ham, or sausage ($2.75), and a toasted bagel with cream cheese ($1).
 
San, 144 Beekman Street, at the corner of Front Street (267-0086), opens at around 3 A.M., Mondays through Fridays, to serve Korean food to customers of the Fulton Fish Market (the menu is Japanese for lunch and dinner). Specialties include spicy fish soup, kimchi stew and rice cake soup with dumplings (all $6).
 
Tom's Restaurant, 2880 Broadway, at the corner of 112th Street (864-6137), serves breakfast daily from 6 to 11 A.M. A meal of two eggs, any style, with bacon, ham, or sausage, toast, orange juice and coffee, is $3.30; a bagel with cream cheese is $1.
 
Regency Hotel, 540 Park Avenue, at the corner of East 61st Street (759-4100), serves breakfast in the main dining room or in the Library daily from 7 to 11 A.M. The $22.50 breakfast consists of two eggs, any style, with bacon, ham, or sausage; orange, carrot or grapefruit juice; assorted pastries, bagel or toast, and coffee, tea or milk. A bagel with cream cheese is $4.
 
More Early-Bird Specials
The big flea market at Sixth Avenue and 26th Street opens early in the morning on weekends and is considered by many to be the city's best.
Just a few months ago in the Chelsea neighborhood, a sprawling indoor food market offering everything from lobsters to cheesecake began opening its doors every morning in an old factory bounded by 9th and 10th Avenues and West 15th and 16th Streets.
A more venerable institution is the Greenmarket in Union Square, once a speaker's corner for assorted radicals, now the province several days a week of bakers and farmers selling their wares to New Yorkers who cannot imagine dinner without brick-oven rolls on their bread plates or shiitake mushrooms in their salads.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: John Barracato;
Fires, on Purpose and in Carelessness

BYLINE: By JACQUELINE WEAVER

 BODY:
FOR nearly 40 years, John Barracato has been preoccupied, almost obsessed, he says, with the cause of fires, whether it be arson fraud, arson for reasons of revenge, accidental or the work of a pathological fire setter.
"When you walk into a building where there has been a fire," says Mr. Barracato, "the building talks to you. It tells you what happened." 
 It was this interest and instinct that led him, a few years after becoming a firefighter in New York, to ask for, and receive, training as an investigator in the fire marshal's office. From 1960 to 1976 he served as a firefighter, fire investigator and deputy chief fire marshal with the New York City Fire Department.
Subsequently, he was assistant vice president of the fire and fraud unit at Aetna Life and Casualty, and wrote a book called "Arson."
Today Mr. Barracato is a consultant and is called in frequently to investigate fires or to testify in court. He discussed his work in a recent interview at his home in South Windsor. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. What does your work as a consultant involve?
A. I go all over the world -- London, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South America. Usually it's a case of suspected arson fraud where there were major losses. For instance, I went to some shirt factories down in Mexico City where they weren't sure whether the fires were an inside job or an outside job. They were done by insiders.
Q. Do we have more fires than other countries?
A. We're the leaders in the world. The reason for that is that no one is held accountable. If you just burned down a house and you displaced four other families and the cause of the fire was smoking carelessness, you're not held accountable for any part of it. About five years ago I read where an American was serving 12 years in a Chinese jail for a fire in a hotel mattress attributed to smoking carelessness. Twelve years is drastic, but here nothing happens to you.
Q. What is another common example of a fire caused by carelessness?
A. When we empty an ashtray, we empty it into a cup and pour water on it. Is that extreme? No. That's being careful. I saw dozens upon dozens of fires with people killed from emptying their ashtrays before they go to bed and there are still glowing embers. Embers glow at 600 degrees. Paper ignites at 420 degrees.
Q. What was your training with the New York fire marshal's office?
A. For the first year you got 8 to 10 fires every day. Maybe one or two might be intentional. Most were food on the stove, mattress fires, smoking fires, extension cord fires. You end up seeing every type of fire imaginable. You know the burn pattern.
You also need some basic knowledge in building, in chemistry, in physics, in the psychology of the fire setter. A properly trained fire investigator, before he leaves that fire scene, should be able to determine if a male set it, a female, if it was revenge motivated, juvenile, arson for profit. You can tell by the manner in which that fire is set.
Q. What is the first thing you look for at the scene of a fire?
A. Lines of demarcation. There is a burn pattern on the building that will tell you where to look when you get inside. You work your way in from the least amount of damage to the most damage, following the direction of burn and char. Then you determine if there were any flammables used.
I had a fire in a warehouse downstate where they made all the stage settings for "My Fair Lady." The building was a city block square and all made out of corrugated steel. The building was totally collapsed. I asked for an aerial ladder to be raised 100 feet, climbed to the top, and I could see where the fire started. I told them to pull up just that area with a crane. We not only uncovered the point of fire origin, we found the machine that caused it. The machine had malfunctioned.
Q. What percentage of fires are accidental?
A. Twenty to 30 percent. Most are smoking carelessness fires. The next most common cause is extension cords. They were not meant to withstand the electricity running through them over an extended period of time. People tuck them under rugs, which is the worst thing you can do. The movement of the rug eventually causes the insulator to crack and if the wires connect you get a spark hot enough to light anything.
Q. What percentage of fires are arson fraud?
A. Between 19 and 29 percent. They are more prevalent in any area where the economy is down.
Q. What about the other fires?
A. About 50 percent of all fires are intentionally set for the purpose of revenge. The higher the divorce rate, the higher the revenge fires.
Q. What do you do when you suspect arson?
A. If I think you set that fire, I will go out of my way to see that you are arrested, providing I can prove it. If I can't prove it or if I have even a weak feeling about that fire, I don't call it. I walk away from it because you could ruin innocent people.
Q. What can you tell by the way in which a fire was set?
A. A nonaggressive fire is usually set by a woman or a juvenile under the age of 13. If the fire was aggressive, if flammable liquids were introduced, that's usually set by a male.
Q. Why do juveniles set fires?
A. For the most part they come from single-parent families, they have no male role model, or he's dysfunctional. Usually they are doing poorly scholastically. The child turns to one of the most powerful tools known to man: fire. He gets a lot of attention. Look at all the fire trucks he can make come in there, ambulances, police cars. That's a euphoric feeling.
Q. Many children play with matches. How do you know when it's a problem?
A. There is an age group, usually between 5, 7 maximum. If it goes beyond 7, you might be having a problem. I was at a fire once in a tenement house, in a child's room, a mattress fire. We wanted to speak to the child, but the mother wouldn't allow us to. Four days later we took them all out in body bags.
If it's past the age of 17, he's turning into a pathological fire setter. Now you have a totally different type, one who never stops setting fires.
Q. How can you tell if a fire was set for profit or for revenge?
A. By the manner in which the fire was set. At a house fire, first I determine if the fire was intentionally set with a flammable liquid. If it was an aggressive fire, I have to think first: male. Is it absolute? No. But 90 percent certain. If the flammable liquid was introduced in the interior of the house, the motive was probably profit. If the same fire was started outside, it's usually a revenge fire, maybe drug associated. As a stranger I can't go into your house and pour gasoline, but I will throw a Molotov cocktail.
Q. What about arson fraud?
A. There is almost always financial instability. We had a fire in a shop that only delivered pizzas. But there were no pizza boxes inside. He had stopped ordering pizza boxes 30 days prior to the fire. Then we found out he hadn't been ordering dough or sauce. That was glaring.
Q. What did your study of fire setters show?
A. I interviewed 927 people who were arrested for arson. Females generally set fires for attention or for revenge. If she is seeking attention from a teacher she might set a fire on his desk or in the waste basket and is usually the first person offering sympathy or help in cleaning up.
Q. What about the pathological fire setter, the pyromaniac?
A. They are usually so severely introverted that they can't relate to other people. They turn to the thing that makes them feel good. The fire to them is the female. She never turns them down, never. They'll usually set nonaggressive fires. What makes them so dangerous is that they leave without putting the fire out or warning people. The only good thing is only 3 percent of the fire setting in the nation is pathological.
Q. What about a professional arsonist?
A. Professional arsonists we don't catch. A professional is usually hired by a large business that is not doing well. A torch usually gets 10 percent of the face value of the policy and he usually wants it up front. The average homeowner doesn't have it up front. The professional comes in at night, usually without help, and they're gone the next morning.

HEADLINE: Touro Plans Law School Near New Courts

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
WHEN Judge Leonard Wexler of Federal States District Court in Hauppauge taught a course in trial practice at Touro Law Center two years ago, his students asked to hold the class in his courtroom. He agreed on one condition: that they dress appropriately.
"Students generally come to class dressed sloppily," he said. "No one wears a tie and jacket. So I said I expected them to dress up, and not one failed to dress up the entire semester. I was amazed. It just showed their interest." 
 Judge Wexler said the students would invariably arrive early to watch lawyers in action and then critique in class what they saw. And having them sit in the jury box and present arguments from the well of the courtroom "dissipated the strangeness."
It is that enthusiasm and involvement that the dean of Touro Law Center, Howard A. Glickstein, hopes to recreate by moving the school from a former school building in Huntington to a wooded 18.5-acre site that was part of the former Central Islip Pscyhiatric Center. The site is just north of the Southern State Parkway and to the east of Carleton Avenue. It abuts the United States Courthouse and Federal Building Complex, expected to be completed in 1999, and the John P. Cohalan Jr. Court Complex, which includes State Supreme, District and Family Court buildings.
"Nowhere in the United States is there a campus with Federal and state courts and a law school," Mr. Glickstein said. "We want to see if we can find ways of improving legal education and the administration of justice by having a legal institution so close to the courts."
"You would not think of opening a medical school in the woods but rather as part of or next to a hospital," he said. "But most law schools are not even near a courthouse."
Such a relationship would help put Touro Law Center, which is ranked by U.S. News & World Report in the lower one-third of law schools, on the map, according to the dean.
"We opened in Huntington in 1982 and it takes a long time for a school to build a reputation," he said. "What helps is a unique approach, and moving to Central Islip will give us a niche that will help our reputation. People all over the country will be interested in what is going on there."
Mr. Glickstein shrugged off Touro's ranking, saying it was based on the reputation the school enjoys among lawyers and judges across the nation.
"How is a lawyer in Butte, Mont., going to rate Touro?" he asked. "He's never heard of it. Yet if Princeton were to open a law school tomorrow, it would get ranked near the top by people who have no idea who is teaching there. So the system of ranking is flawed."
This week, to further enhance its image, the school will be host to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the United States Supreme Court. She will give a lecture at 6 P.M. Thursday in the law school auditorium. Her topic is "Reflections on Way Paving: Jewish Justices and Jewish Women." It is free and open to the public.
The new building will be designed to allow Touro to maintain its enrollment at 750 students. Anything larger, Mr. Glickstein said, would make the school "too impersonal."
Mr. Glickstein said that, based on the sale of other property to educational institutions recently, he would guess the land would cost the college $15,000 to $20,000 an acre. The building project is expected to take two years and cost $25 million. It is expected to be two stories tall and 150,000 square feet.
A task force set up in March 1996 to suggest future uses for the 87.2 acres used by the former Central Islip Psychiatric Center and for other state purposes recommended in September that the 18.5 acres be used for an "educational institution, ideally one that would benefit from the proximity to the court complex."
A member of the task force, Nancy Manfredonia, the executive director of the Central Islip Civic Association, said Touro's proposed move was "so perfect that I assume it has to work."
"If I were a young law student, that's where I'd be going," she said. "It's a perfect location for the school and I'm ready to celebrate if it happens."
She said that having the law school move to the site would be another plus for Central Islip, which 10 years ago was designated by the state as an economic development zone.
"Within 10 years time we have had a tremendous success story," Ms. Manfredonia said, adding that the master plan calls for developing housing, industry, office space and educational facilities in the community.
The Supervisor of Islip, Pete McGowan, said the law school would "bring more and more people who bring people and create jobs."
"We're not only talking about teaching jobs, but for mom and pop stores the move might mean 50 more sandwiches a day," he said.
He added that the court complex had helped to revitalize Central Islip, which had "come a long way in 10 years -- like day and night."
A 1995 study by Thomas Conoscenti & Associates, an economic consulting firm in Nesconset hired by Touro, found that construction of the law center and a law school would have a positive impact on Central Islip. The two projects would contribute $21 million in income to the Islip economy and $41.7 million to the region. During construction, it would create 437 jobs in Islip and nearly 600 in the region.
Mr. Glickstein said he envisioned a section of the school set aside for a judicial training center for both new and seasoned judges. And courses would be offered for nonjudicial staff as well.
The administrative judge of Suffolk County courts, Supreme Court Justice Mary M. Werner, said she believed it was a "wonderful opportunity to have state and Federal courts across the parking lot from the law school."
"And it's a super idea to have a judicial training center for judges to take continuing legal and professional education courses," she said.
Justice Werner noted that Touro was already very much involved in the legal community in Suffolk. Several state judges are on the faculty and the school is to play host to a program for judges, lawyers and law students that seeks to foster "the concept of civility and professionalism between the bench and the bar."
With the school in Central Islip, Justice Werner said, she envisions Touro students running law classes for pro-se litigants, or people who represent themselves, and "doing exciting and innovative programs because of their proximity to the courts."
When the Federal court complex is completed, all Federal courts on Long Island will move to the site. That includes the courts in Uniondale, which rent a building owned by Hofstra University and which are a short distance from the Hofstra Law School. A spokeswoman for Hofstra University, Valerie Zurblis, said that despite the move the school would continue to maintain a relationship with the courts. And she played down the advantage Touro would have being on the same campus as the state and Federal courts.
"Many law schools are located near courthouses," she said. "Brooklyn Law School is near the Eastern District and New York Law School is near the Southern District. Many law schools are in downtown areas to be near the court system. It's really quite common."
Ms. Zurblis added that the Hofstra Law School already enjoyed a good reputation and was "more competitive with schools outside of Long Island, such as New York University, Syracuse University and Boston University."
But Judge Wexler, who is chairman of the Long Island Courthose Construction Project, said he would have liked to have developed a closer relationship with Hofstra Law School when his law offices were in Uniondale from 1983 to 1986. He said that he had reached out to the school but that "nobody seemed interested."
The immediate past president of the Suffolk County Bar Association, John L. Juliano, said he was working with Touro to develop joint programs with the Suffolk Academy of Law, the educational arm of the Bar Association. He too was excited about the juxtaposition of the school and the courthouses.
"Students will have an opportunity to learn various legal procedures in a classroom setting and then walk across the parking lot and see it firsthand," he said. "It can do nothing but good for the school."
In addition, Mr. Juliano said, the close proximity of the school to the courts would make it more convenient for lawyers to use the school's 250,000-volume library, which is made available to them for a nominal fee, and to take continuing education courses there.

HEADLINE: Police Wage Award Used Suffolk Scale, Rising Over 20%

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
ON a short list of the richest places in the United States, Nassau County and its exclusive villages virtually always rank near the top. Even in less expensive communities, the average household income is reported to approach $70,000 a year.
Now an arbitrator's award that pushes the pay of police officers to historic highs assures that officers in the Nassau County Police Department will earn salaries to match the wealth, making them aristocrats among police forces. 
 Ten months after an award by the same arbitrator ushered in the era of the $70,000-a-year officer in Suffolk, a five-year contract in Nassau will increase total earnings for many officers to about $100,000 in three years, including overtime and other payments. The estimate, offered by several county officials, does not include benefits like health insurance. Superior officers have higher scales.
The higher salaries mean that officers, whose earnings often peak in their final years on the force, will be paid significantly higher pensions, which are based on peak earnings. Officers can retire after 20 years of work.
The arbitrator's award, retroactive to last year, raises the base salary over five years by 24 percent or 22 percent, depending on how the increase is calculated. Officers with seven years' experience will have a base salary of $73,859 by 2000 for a maximum of 154 workdays a year. Under the force's steady-tour system, an average officer works 12-hour shifts three days a week.
County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who is seeking a third term in November, declined last week through a spokesman to comment on the decision. The spokesman, David A. Vieser, referred all questions on the contract to special counsel Peter A. Bee, who represented Mr. Gulotta in the arbitration.
Mr. Bee said the award, by Martin F. Scheinman of Manhasset, "was not a surprise to me." He said it allowed for increases that were virtually identical to those that Mr. Scheinman decided in Suffolk.
In past campaigns Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, has been endorsed by the Police Benevolent Association, the union for the 2,100 rank-and-file officers. He is expected to win union's endorsement this year.
Mr. Gulotta's refusal to comment on an award with major financial implications for the county contrasts with an otherwise active schedule. This month, for example, Mr. Gulotta was available for photographs that showed him presenting checks to help first-time home buyers make down payments.
His opponent, Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay, offered measured criticism. "The question was not whether the police were entitled to an increase," Mr. Yevoli said. "It was whether the citizens of Nassau County could afford to pay the increase."
The answer, Mr. Yevoli said, was no.
Mr. Yevoli said Mr. Gulotta, the County Legislature and the P.B.A. should meet to discuss cutting costs like overtime. "That's the next big mandate," he said. "The arbitrator's award is binding. Now you have to go to the responsible parties and say there there isn't enough money to pay and now you have to come up with ways money can be saved."
Mr. Yevoli said the county faced a deficit of $20 million to $60 million, even before the decision. Mr. Gulotta says there is no deficit.
Comptroller Frederick Parola said last week that the county would have to pay $9 million retroactively because of the ruling. The money, Mr. Parola added, could be raised through selling bonds.
The P.B.A. sought arbitration after Mr. Yevoli and another Democrat, Supervisor May W. Newberger of North Hempstead, did not ratify a negotiated contract in late 1995, as the old Board of Supervisors was about to be replaced by the Legislature.
The president of the union, Gary DelaRaba, said Mr. Scheinman's award was "actually a little bit better" than the 1995 accord.
Mr. Bee, the county negotiator, agreed that "in general terms this contract was more expensive."
Mr. Yevoli said the differences between the 1995 agreement and the arbitrator's award were slight.
Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi of Glen Cove, a Democrat, said the 1995 contract and the arbitration award were excessive. He faulted Mr. Gulotta, saying:
"The County Executive does not aggressively represent the taxpayers in arbitration because he is too close to the P.B.A. The arbitrator made these outrageous awards with his tacit consent.
"Our police in Nassau County do an excellent job, and our Glen Cove police are the best in the state. I have no qualms as far as the performance of the county police. But enough is enough as far as the pay goes."
Mr. Yevoli also objected to the arbitrated salaries. "You need to have a certain amount of courage to be a police officer and it's hard to criticize," he said. "But $74,000 for 154 days? That's an awful lot of money."
Mr. DelaRaba rejected the view that the officers would be overpaid. "We are getting what everybody else in the county-police community is getting, nothing more, nothing less," he said.
In the arbitration, the P.B.A. sought salaries similar to those paid in Nassau villages, where officers earn more than those on the county force. The county argued that the pay should be compared to Suffolk.
Mr. Scheinman said last week that comparisons between Nassau and Suffolk were central to his decision.
The total increases for the first four years in the Nassau contract are quite similar to the total increases in the four-year contract in Suffolk. The Nassau contract awards a 4.5 percent increase in the fifth year, the minimum amount that Suffolk officers would receive in the first year of a new contract, using the comparability approach.
"Over the years," Mr. Scheinman said, "the parties in these negotiations and arbitrations have argued that the most comparable comparable community for Nassau County is Suffolk County. That has been the position the county argued in this case, and I agreed. The police asked for more than Suffolk County."
Arbitration awards are also based on salaries paid in comparable areas and on a community's ability to pay. Nassau's wealth makes that consideration secondary.
A contract provision that the P.B.A. and the county described as the first of its kind requires new officers to have four-year undergraduate degrees to qualify for top pay. The contract also sets pay at $21,000 for the first year, a provision that lessens the cost of hiring.
The contract sets a standard for pay that other police unions will seek in negotiations on Long Island and elsewhere. Police officers in New York City, who earn less than Nassau or Suffolk officers, are excluded from the state board that provides for arbitration in other areas of the state, including Long Island. But city police unions quite certainly will cite the disparity in pay in contract talks.
Just as Long Island schoolteachers have received wage increases from school boards over 30 years that have brought salaries more in line with the high cost of living, officers in both counties and in cities and villages have gradually gained major salary advances.
But in the fiscal crisis of the early 1990's, when state aid to districts decreased and opposition to rising school budgets stiffened, many local boards limited salary increases.
By contrast, increases in county police pay can be offset in county budgets by adjustments in general spending. Nassau and Suffolk have also substituted higher sales taxes for increases in property taxes, a step that has led to higher revenues in recent years as a regional recession has given way to recovery and stronger sales.
The method of police payment and the unwillingness of elected officials and office seekers to criticize the politically powerful police unions have buffered the police from complaints. The reluctance also reflects a perception that the Nassau force enjoys broad public support in a region where the crime rate is low and declining.
Some experts have said the lower rate stems in part from an aging population. But current and former Nassau officials said they sensed that public sentiment was behind the police.
"Generally people are gong to give the police the benefit of the doubt," Benjamin L. Zwirn, former supervisor in North Hempstead, said. "When you dial 911 you want someone to show up quickly who is well trained and capable of handling an emergency."
Police unions have also been successful in protecting state laws that provide for arbitration in contract disputes and base salary decisions on the ability to pay and salaries paid in comparable areas. The laws provide for binding arbitration for police officers, who are barred from striking.

HEADLINE: New Rochelle Celebrates With a Street Festival

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
NEW ROCHELLE celebrates New Rochelle on the last day of summer next Sunday, with a street festival that will focus on the city's many attributes.
The festival begins at noon at Library Plaza in the heart of New Rochelle's, opposite the train station a block from Main Street. 
 Dance troupes, music groups, street performers and jugglers will entertain throughout the day, along with puppet and magic shows, face-painting and hands-on crafts and carnival rides for children.
An international food court will offer foods from China, Mexico, the Caribbean, Italy, Israel and the United States, and the event is sponsored by the New Rochelle Overall Economic Development Corporation.
"One of the primary purposes of the Economic Development Corporation is to raise the profile of our city as an ideal community in which to invest in for the future," Fred Wiener, chairman of the corporation, said, adding that the festival will bring people to downtown New Rochelle, "where they discover just how much the city has to offer."
Melanie Stern, co-chairman of the event, said, "It's a celebration of all the things that make New Rochelle a great place to live, to work and to do business."
"Like New Rochelle," Mrs. Stern said, "our celebration will be a rich mosaic, diverse with something for everyone."
Business, community groups and public service organizations will also be represented. "They will be manning information booths," said Rob Seitz, a businessman and member of the board of the Economic Development Corporation. "The event is a showcase for all the programs the Economic development Corporation runs, including a loan program for women and minority-owned businesses, our new business incubator, which will open soon and our Culture Builds Communities, a program promoting the arts, and our business retention program designed to keep existing businesses in New Rochelle. The festival is a an effective way we draw attention to New Rochelle as a good place to do business."
New Rochelle businesses underwriting the event include Chase Bank, Citibank, Monroe College and New Roc Corporation, developers of the new downtown mall. City government departments, the New Rochelle Chamber of Commerce and the Westchester County Tourism Board were also active in planning and producing the festival.

HEADLINE: A Ball Game In Bridgeport's Near Future

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
NOT far from a failed dog track, which previously had been a failed jai alai fronton, and on a site where the real estate developer Donald Trump had hoped to build a gambling casino, a baseball stadium will begin to rise next month near the Bridgeport waterfront.
Assuming the fledging Atlantic League of Professional Baseball Clubs gets off the ground, the new ballpark will be the home of the Bridgeport Bluefish, which would be the city's first professional baseball team since the Bridgeport Bees of the short-lived Class B Colonial League in the late 1940's. Current plans call for the Bluefish to begin play at what will be called Harbor Yard next May when the Atlantic League begins its first season with six or seven teams. 
 The ballpark is viewed as the first component of a sports and recreational complex on the Bridgeport waterfront that will include a sports arena, a new intermodal transportation center, a parking garage and, possibly, a museum for baseball memorabilia. Construction of the 5,000-seat stadium on the site of the former Jenkins Brothers Valve Company plant close by Interstate 95 is scheduled to start this month and be completed by next April, weather permitting.
"Everything is go for our first season," said Mary Jane Foster, who with her husband, Jack McGregor, runs Bridgeport Waterfront Investors and owns one-third of the Bluefish franchise. "We think the ballpark and the team will help reintroduce Bridgeport as the wonderful city that it is."
According to the league's chief executive officer, Frank Boulton, the caliber of play will be on a Triple A level, meaning one step lower than the major leagues. "In a way it will be like the old Pacific Coast League with a mix of young players on the way up and veterans who've already played in the big leagues," said Mr. Boulton, a Wall Street executive who lives on Long Island and has owned three minor league teams, including the Albany Yankees of the Eastern League, which has moved to Norwich. "All the funding is in for the six new ballparks being built -- $83.5 million in public monies and about $25 million in private money."
Besides Bridgeport, teams will be situated in Newark, Atlantic City and Somerset County in southern New Jersey; in Suffolk County on Long Island, in Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania and in Nashua, N.H., the only location where an existing stadium will be used on a regular basis. Of the $14 million allocated for the Bridgeport stadium, $7 million has been allotted by the City of Bridgeport while the remaining $7 million will be in the form of a state bond issue.
The state money will come from a fund known as Team Bridgeport. In all, the city is expected to receive $125 million for redevelopment in increments of $25 million a year over five years. To date, the State Legislature has authorized the allocation of $75 million. A large portion of that money is expected to be used to build a multipurpose sports arena near the baseball stadium.
Some might also go towards construction of a baseball museum that would house the vast collection of memorabilia owned by Barry Halper, who is a part owner of the New York Yankees. Bridgeport is one of several cities that have put in bids for the Halper collection, which many experts believe is even more comprehensive and extensive than that assembled at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
"It would be great having the Halper collection in Bridgeport," Ms. Foster said. "I've seen it, and it's absolutely amazing."
In keeping with a national trend, the Bridgeport baseball stadium, while state-of-the art in most respects, will resemble old-style ballparks in many ways. For example, the red brick exterior will evoke Bridgeport's legacy as a major industrial city. The stadium design was a collaborative effort by Kasper Group Inc., a Bridgeport architectural and engineering firm, and Design Exchange of Newark, Del.
In keeping with another baseball trend, merchandise with the Bluefish's logo and colors -- navy blue, silver and teal -- is already being sold out of the team's offices at 189 State Street in downtown Bridgeport, which stock team caps, T-shirts, jackets, pennants and fountain pens. "Business has been pretty good," said David Fowler, who works in the team office.
Though the Bluefish have a logo -- a tenacious-looking bluefish wielding a bat -- and are selling merchandise, the club has yet to hire a general manager. But Ms. Foster said such a hiring is imminent.
Mickey Herbert, one of the chief executive officers of Phyicians Health Care in Shelton, who owns a third of the Bridgeport franchise, said ticket prices would probably average about $5.50. Seats in the stadium's 20 skyboxes, however, will cost considerably more: $20,000 a year for a 16-seat box.
The Bluefish will bring to five the number of minor league baseball teams in Connecticut. That is believed to be an all-time high. Three of the other teams -- the New Haven Ravens, the New Britain Rock Cats and the Norwich Navigators -- are in the Double A Eastern League, while the fourth, the Waterbury Spirit, is in the independent Northeast League.
But both Ms. Foster and Mr. Herbert believe that the Bluefish will draw primarily from an untapped market: Fairfield County and, to a lesser degree, Westchester County. "We're going after a totally different market," said Ms. Foster whose husband was the founder of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. "And it includes one of the wealthiest and most populous counties in the country."
Although the New Haven Ravens play less than 20 miles away, neither they nor the other teams will hurt the Bluefish in terms of attendance, Ms. Foster and Mr. Herbert say. "A rising tide raises all boats," Mr. Herbert noted. "The more teams there are, the more interest is created."
But Charlie Dowd, the general manager of the New Haven Ravens, does worry that the Bluefish will hurt his team at the box office. "There's definitely a concern that they'll have a negative impact on our attendance," Mr. Dowd said. "They will only be 20 minutes away in a brand new ballpark, and they'll have the ability to cut off our efforts to get into Fairfield County."
The Bluefish, like the league itself, would be independent, with no ties to any major league club. Players would be owned by the league but paid by the team owners. Mr. Boulton, the league's C.E.O., said that salaries could range as high as $25,000. Teams will play 140 games, he said, except for the inaugural season when, because of all the stadium construction, the season won't start until May 20 or so and include only 100 games.
Team owners include former New York Yankees Rick Cerone, who owns the Newark franchise, and Sparky Lyle, the owner of the team in Bridgewater, N.J. Former New York Mets shortstop Buddy Harrelson will manage the Long Island team, while former big league managers Jim Frey and Doc Edwards are also scheduled to be involved with the league, Mr. Boulton said.
"It will be affordable family entertainment," Mr. Boulton said. "We'll be competing with the movies and our prices will be in the same range." Mr. Herbert, one of the owners of the Bluefish, said he expected grandstand tickets would cost about $7, but that some tickets might be priced as low as $2.
Michael Freimuth, the Bridgeport's director of economic development, said the stadium would be clearly visible from Interstate 95 and easily accessible. "People driving along I-95 will be able to look right down on the field, and you'll be able to walk to the ballpark from downtown, from the train and bus stations and from the ferry terminal," Mr. Freimuth said. "And the new garage will provide space for between 500 and 700 cars."
All the transportation will be upgraded into a "intermodal transit center" with a cost estimated at $35 million. The Federal Government is expected to pay 80 percent of the cost, with the city and state paying the remainder, according to Mr. Freimuth.
The proposed sports arena would seat between 5,500 and 8,500 spectators, Mr. Freimuth said, and would cost between $35 million and $40 million. It could be used for basketball and hockey by both Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities, "and it could also be used for concerts, trade shows and circuses," Mr. Freimuth said. "And we've already had inquiries from a minor league hockey team and a startup professional basketball league." But he said that construction of the sports arena could be "two or three years away."
Another lure would be the museum housing the Barry Halper collection, which includes more than 1,000 baseball uniforms, including those worn by Babe Ruth and Cy Young, and which has been appraised at $42 million, according to Paul Timpanelli, the executive director of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council.
"We've had extensive discussions with Mr. Halper, and we know that Bridgeport is in the running along with Hoboken and some other cities," said Mr. Timparelli. The Mashantucket Pequots, riding high with the Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard, are "committed to help us financially in getting the Halper collection," Mr. Timpanelli said. "If we get it, we think that in five or 10 years we'll be drawing more people than the 400,000 or so who visit Cooperstown each year. Cooperstown is in the middle of nowhere, while there are 25 million people within 100 miles of Bridgeport."
But the museum, like the arena, is a future project. The ballpark will be the first tangible symbol of redevelopment on the Bridgeport waterfront.
"The ballpark," Mr. Timpanelli said, "will help give people a different perception of Bridgeport."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Celebrating New Age On New Haven Stage

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
ONCE, the New Haven tryout came with the territory of a Broadway-bound show. That meant a few weeks at the Shubert, which opened its doors in 1914.
Over the next six decades -- cresting from the 1940's to the 1960's, diminishing in the 1970's -- the Shubert was the birthing place of a breathtaking galaxy of classics: "Carousel," "Born Yesterday," "Annie Get Your Gun," "All My Sons," "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Mister Roberts," "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." And seven plays by Neil Simon. 
 For many other shows, already premiered, the Shubert was an essential pre-Broadway nurturing stop. Like "Barefoot in the Park" by Mr. Simon.
Now the road to Broadway, strewn with necessary alternatives, is rougher, lengthier, costlier -- and not frequently taken. So, no one is going to make believe that the glory days of live theater are still here.
But, starting Tuesday, it won't take a colossal leap into a time warp to revisit a golden age where the past is the present.
That's when Mr. Simon's new play, "Proposals" will open at the Shubert, to run through Sept. 28 in preparation for Broadway where it begins previews on Oct. 29. Opening night at the Broadhurst Theater is Nov. 6.
Tuesday night's opening will mark the theater's re-opening, the dawning of a new age for the Shubert, so grandly haunted and informed by a treasured past. Although a wall of fame -- which lists close to 80 years of show titles (except for the theater's dark period, from 1976 to 1983) -- is its everlasting centerpiece, the 1,600-seat Shubert, which now calls itself a "new old theater" is to show off a major touch-up.
So much for the beauty part. But the theater would be neither new nor old were it not for an elaborate "Save the Shubert" plan, involving Yale University, Community Foundation for Greater New Haven and business organizations.
The plan came to pass last year when the theater was on the brink of closing because of a financial crisis. The performing arts center's president, Caroline Werth, describes the renovation as "big, elegant, state of the art changes in a grande dame -- there's even a new boutique."
Now the Shubert "has finally fully blossomed into an exciting range of programs," Ms. Werth said. "Not just theater, but great dance companies and every kind of performance art will find its way into our season. The variety is staggering." The theater will be open 135 nights during the year and otherwise used by community groups. "Our community outreach and education programs have a huge life of their own," Ms. Werth noted.
Given the fearsome business of show business, the Shubert try-out of Mr. Simon's new play cannot signal the revival of the theatrical tradition. "A new process has taken over," said Ms. Werth, referring to extended pre-Broadway tours, the unspoken but undeniable role of regional and institution theaters as try-out centers as well as various play and musical development organizations.
Still, "Proposals" at the Shubert resounds with tradition and the memory of a style that evokes nostalgia in veteran theatergoers who have grown accustomed to a clutter of names and corporations above the title of a play.
"Proposals," like all Mr. Simon's plays since 1972, uses the real solo theater producer -- here, Emanuel Azenberg -- who represents an all but vanished breed, the seasoned man of theater in place of a conglomerate or an invasion of newcomers.
"This is the way it was, old-fashioned try-outs," Mr. Azenberg said after returning from Phoenix, the second stop in the "Proposals" try-out schedule. "And Neil comes in with rewrites every 15 minutes. But the economics are terrifying and it can't be seen as a trend, just a celebration of old times."
Evidently, Mr. Simon's play also evokes warmth and tradition. In mixed reviews, out of town critics have called it "autumnal in mood" and "mellow" as well as "witty and cutting and impossibly wise."
The play takes place in 1957 in the Pocono Mountains. During the New Haven engagement, Dick Latessa is to replace Ron Rifkin in the role of Burt Hines, the owner of a chain of television stores who is recovering from a heart attack. He is being visited by his ex-wife, his daughter, her three admirers, one of their dates and a housekeeper.
The director of "Proposals," Joe Mantello, who is associated with more abrasive cutting edge theater, as an actor ("Angels in America") and as a director ("Love! Valour! Compassion!" "Three Hotels") had another take on a "new old" experience.
"I've never gone out of town before," he said. "This is a crowd-pleasing, old fashioned play. It's very warm and sweet and funny and wistful, not urban or edgy."
Mr. Mantello says has not read the out of town reviews. "We're listening to the audience and to our own instincts," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Greenwich, Conn.;
Running Mom and Pop Off Glitzy Greenwich Avenue

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn.

 BODY:
LAST September, when Saks Fifth Avenue opened its store for women in Greenwich, Conn. -- the most elegant and expensive apparel shop in town -- it was a major step in Greenwich's ongoing transition from local to national and international retailing.
Consequently, like other wealthy communities across the country, Greenwich's retail rents and sales of buildings with stores have risen from 20 to 30 percent in the last two years alone, causing some real estate professionals to call the .7-mile Greenwich Avenue and the 180 stores lining it "Rodeo Drive East," after the high-end shopping mecca in Beverly Hills. 
 A walk down the avenue today would surprise anyone who has not visited Greenwich lately. Finch's drugstore has been replaced by Starbucks. Instead of Woolworth's there is Saks. Ralph Lauren, The Gap, Banana Republic, Baccarat, and Henry Lehr & Company, a sportswear store, are some of the stores that have nudged out shops that had been on the avenue for generations.
Rents have risen from $10 to $20 a square foot in the early 1980's to a range of $60 to more than $80 a square foot in 1997. Baccarat, the crystal maker, is paying $81 a square foot for its 730-square-foot shop at Greenwich Avenue and East Elm Street. It replaced a T-shirt store paying rent in the $50's.
"I believe that $100 a foot is doable for a small corner -- just to have a location on the avenue," said Patrick A. Smith, director of leasing north of New York City for the Manhattan-based Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing.
Perceptions of conspicuous consumption and skyrocketing prices along a street that had been a bastion of old Greenwich conservatism have generated some apprehension and disorientation.
"Mom and Pop would need $80 million to make it on Greenwich Avenue today," said Bernard Yudain, a longtime resident. "Favorite Shoe Store, Rovens Curtains, all the little service shops are gone. Most shoppers and restaurant clientele are from out of town." Yet there is the recognition that the street is markedly improved as older shops upgrade facades, interiors and merchandise to compete with the new tenants.
Broker buoyancy over record transactions is tempered by uncertainty over whether the new shops will thrive.
"History has shown that even in a recession Greenwich office, retail and residential real estate have held up quite nicely," said John D. Goodkind, a broker in the Greenwich office of Newmark & Company Real Estate of New York City. "Unless we have Armageddon that will continue, but there are the Stamford and Westchester malls to reckon with."
The former is five miles away, the latter 14 miles; both have the familiar collection of upscale chain stores that have now settled on Greenwich Avenue. "Whether this is a fad or Greenwich retailers can support these rents," he said, "you wonder how much there is to go around."
"We had a waiting list of 15 prospective tenants for 200 Greenwich Avenue," said Mr. Smith of Garrick-Aug, referring to the sale on Sept. 4 of a 47,500-square-foot retail and office building brokered by Newmark. Japan Leasing USA sold it for $20 million to RFR Holding LLC, a German investment group in Manhattan.
Brentano's, Shawmut Bank, and Chalk & Vermilion, an art gallery, moved out when their leases expired; Ann Taylor, CP Shades, a California women's sportswear concern, and two unnamed tenants are moving in at rents of $65 to $75 a square foot -- 30 percent higher than the previous rents. "We set an unrealistically high number and got close to our price," said Mr. Smith.
He predicted that there would be a higher concentration of upscale tenants in the two center blocks, close to municipal parking -- and that like Main Street in Westport, rents would increase disproportionately to sales volume. "Eventually," he added, "there will be some sort of correction."
Saks's 35,000-square-foot store was sold to Street Retail, a wholly owned subsidiary of Federal Realty Investment Trust of Rockville, MD., for $12.5 million, or $350 a square foot in 1995.
Federal, the first REIT to enter the Greenwich Avenue market, has bought three additional Greenwich Avenue properties since then, and it is looking for more, according to Harvey Miller, leasing agent for Street Retail.
ITS purchase last year for $9.4 million of the 25,524-square-foot building at 252-260 Greenwich Avenue, where Gap Kids and Banana Republic are tenants, was another example of sales that continue to rocket out of range of their assessments. Saks is assessed at $3.3 million, 252-260 Greenwich Avenue at $3.79 million, far less than the normal 70 percent of market value.
When Greenwich real estate comes up for revaluation in 1999 the results could trigger some tax increases on Greenwich Avenue. The town is not due for its 10-year state-mandated revaluation until 2002, but "there are inequities that need to be corrected," said Harriet Wieboldt, the town's assessor.
"We expect to use income and expense data heavily, and those that have been underassessed will be closely scrutinized," she said. As a hypothetical example, the building in which the D.W. Rogers department store, founded in 1873, has its home at 239 Greenwich Avenue, is for sale at $10 million, but assessed at $3.76 million. The 35,767-square-foot building was purchased by its current owner, Terry Baxendale, for $2 million in 1983. Above the store 21 fully rented studio- to 3-bedroom apartments on three floors, renting for $900 to $1,400 a month, supplement the income from the somewhat outdated store.
"It's a fact of life that diversity is disappearing," said Mr. Baxendale. "I would prefer to be in a shopping area that isn't so appealing. This is becoming a very focused market."
The building's taxes, based on the full sale price, could rise from the current $52,928 to as much as $117,700, according to estimates from the assessor's office.
Mr. Smith does not see tax increases as a negative. "Taxes amount to about 10 percent of a retail tenant's costs and are customarily passed through from landlord to tenant," he said.
Not all local retailers who own their properties are interested in selling. Albert E. Betteridge owns Betteridge Jewelers at 117 Greenwich Avenue, a 6,000-square-foot store that his father took over from Henry Webb Jewelers in the 1940's. He has refused several offers.
"I kind of like what's going on," he said. A retailer of Tiffany's line and a manufacturer of his own jewelry on the premises, he caters to a prosperous clientele.
"My father's customers were Carnegies, Mellons and Rockefellers," he said. "They inherited more jewelry than they bought. Today's Wall Streeters did not inherit. They made their money and they are my customers."
THE one and only local retailing venture to come along in recent memory is the merger of Richard's of Greenwich, a Greenwich Avenue men's store, and Mitchell's, a men's and women's store in Westport. "There's nothing left that's family owned in Westport," said Ross Mitchell.
Two years ago the Mitchells and Ed Schacter's family, owners of Richard's, decided to join forces and create a new Richard's on a 35,000-square-foot Sunoco gas station site at Greenwich Avenue and Fawcett Place. By obtaining the rights to an adjacent parcel of 16,000 square feet, the retailers expect to supply surface parking for 80 cars, and underground parking for 268 cars, of which 126 spaces will be paid for and reserved by the town.
The $20 million project, including a 35,000-square-foot store designed by Herbert Newman, professor of architecture at Yale, is scheduled to go before the Greenwich Planning and Zoning Commission for site plan approval on Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS;
In the Age of the Portobello Mushroom, Culinary Courses Keep Pace

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER

 BODY:
WHAT'S cooking?
It depends where you look in the culinary arts programs at New Jersey's technical and vocational high schools. 
 On Monday, one Bergen County student was starting with the basics: learning where to pour water into a coffee maker almost too high for her to reach. In the same kitchen on the Hackensack campus, other students were putting the finishing touches on a pan-seared salmon fillet and a portobello mushroom risotto.
In Warren County, the sound of the first bell at 8:03 A.M. sets off a controlled frenzy of slicing and sauteeing as student chefs prepare for the first wave of the lunch crowd, which hits at 10:22. During the first week of school, one day's menu included an entree (orange-glazed chicken or Philadelphia cheese steak), a soup (minestrone or chicken with fresh cilantro), mixed vegetables or green beans amandine, roasted potatoes and dessert (cherry crumb pie, devil's food cake or cookies), plus a drink. The price: $1.40.
At Passaic County Technical Institute, where cafeterias staffed by students regularly serve 2,000 meals a day, Tuesday was the first day of business at Chez Technique, a formal restaurant on the school premises. All the tables had been set, complete with flower arrangements and artfully folded napkins. Now, with hands steady or shaky, students were preparing to greet the first customers, and put into practice their first three days of lessons in table service.
In case anyone is confused, we are not talking about old-fashioned home-economics courses here.
The intent of the culinary arts programs -- indeed, of all the programs in the state's vocational and technical high schools -- is to give students both the skills and the attitudes necessary to succeed in a competitive and rapidly changing economy.
"Probably the best reason for accepting kids in this school is the vision they have for setting goals for themselves as far as a career," said Diana C. Lobosco, the chief school administrator at Passaic County Technical Institute.
Some of the culinary arts graduates will go straight to work. Some will graduate with credits that will count toward degrees at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I., or at the community colleges in Hudson and Atlantic counties, for example. Still others will enter four-year universities..
Some students choose culinary arts because they already know they like working with food. "I just love staying in the kitchen," said James Evans, a junior from Paterson enrolled in the Passaic program. "I grew up living with a bunch of women. There was nothing to do but stay in the kitchen."
As a result, he entered high school knowing how to make a first-rate dish of ziti and knowing that he wanted to pursue a career in restaurant or hotel management.
Other students may never have spent time in a kitchen, except to raid the refrigerator. But Joseph Delesky, an instructor at the Warren County Vocational Technical School, says, "It's possible to take someone who has no experience whatsoever, someone who couldn't even make a grilled cheese sandwich, and have them succeed."
Are children really mature enough at 13 or 14 to decide what they want to be when they grow up?
"They're not signing their life away," said John Kolmos, director of curriculum for the Bergen County Technical Schools. "They're exploring alternatives. Do you like handling food? Do you like managing people? What about the hours? Bakers get up three hours earlier than chefs."
And, Mr. Kolmos and other educators note, studying culinary arts does not lock students into one job forever. Everybody eats: toddlers at day-care centers, students in school cafeterias, bankers in corporate dining rooms, patients in hospitals.
Somebody has to cook all this food and staff the supermarkets that serve people who still do their own cooking. Bergen County is confident enough about the growth of the culinary arts that it is spending almost $1 million to transform an old electrical shop into a kitchen that will quadruple the space for food preparation and set up two dining rooms for faculty meals and special events. It is scheduled to open by January 1999.
Pat Cosgrove, district coordinator of the school-to-careers program for the Bergen County technical schools, makes the point that technical-school students acquire skills that are useful in any job. "They learn about working in teams, problem-solving, creative thinking," she said.
They also can't help learning something about the community around them. At Barnert Hospital in Paterson, Bergen County students studied Jewish dietary laws. At the Radisson Hotel in Englewood, they learned how to handle a Muslim wedding reception. (Rule No. 1: no liquor.) In cooking for the Bleshman School in Paramus, students tackle the complexities of feeding the severely disabled; they learn, for example, that food for people with cerebral palsey must be blended carefully so they can swallow it without difficulty.
The instructors know the realities of their field because they used to be in the kitchens themselves. Joseph Delesky, who teaches at Warren County Vocational-Technical High School in Washington, worked in corporate dining for Sierra Food Services. Guy Dunagan, who teaches in Salem County, has a degree from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and worked for nine years as an executive pastry chef at the Trump Plaza casino hotel in Atlantic City. Rico Cannataro, who oversees operations at Passaic County Technical Institute's Chez Technique, has many years' experience at the Manor in West Orange.
The restaurant Mr. Cannataro now manages was developed through a partnership between the Passaic County school and the Society of Quality Restaurants of New Jersey, a trade association representing more than five dozen restaurants. School officials like to call the restaurant "a living classroom" where students in crisp white shirts, black bow ties and black vests are trained to be waiters, hosts, maitres d'hotel and captains. (Students also learn about wines, although they are not allowed to taste them because they are not legally old enough to drink.)
On Tuesday, James Evans and Craig Jackson, another student from Paterson, waited on tables for the first time, reciting the day's special (chicken provolone with fresh pasta) taking drink orders, serving and clearing the tables. Was it a flawless dining experience? No. For one thing, some of the floral arrangements on the table were distractingly tall; for another, one diner was served a soda but no glass. But the service was prompt and courteous, and all the diners at a big table received the entrees they had ordered on the first try, something that can't be counted on in a lot of professional restaurants.
At the end of every meal, diners are presented with a bill (of course) with a report card on the back to rate the service. Before Mr. Cannataro can train his students, he has to train the faculty members who dine at Chez Technique to give honest and detailed critiques.
Whether he got them on Tuesday is anybody's guess. After desserts were served -- tiramisu or a puff pastry fruit tart with orange-lemon sauce -- faculty members were practically swooning.
It's not standard practice to review a restaurant the day it opens, but Chez Technique had nothing to worry about.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Beyond the Ivory Tower, a Sabbatical Is a Valued Perk

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
RICHARD F. ZIEGLER, a Manhattan lawyer, just came back from the Rockies. And Mike Phillips, the chief executive of an investment management firm near Seattle, just returned from Europe.
Vacations, right? 
 Better. Sabbaticals.
"It was about two weeks before I really appreciated how long a period I was going to be gone," said Mr. Phillips, who spent a month in England and another in Italy. "Now, of course, it all seems like it was a dream."
Mr. Ziegler just started his three-month sabbatical and spent the first week on a horse ranch in northern Colorado that had no telephones accessible to guests. "So contacting my voice mail was out of the question," he said happily.
Extended leaves, with or without pay, have become a treasured and, over the last 15 years, increasingly common perquisite for long-term, and even relatively short-term, employees.
In a survey of 829 of its members last year, the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., found that 23 percent offered unpaid sabbaticals and 5 percent offered paid sabbaticals. The sample included some schools and universities, at which sabbaticals have long been offered, as well as many companies.
"While unemployment is low, companies are trying new things to attract, motivate and retain talent," said Barry Lawrence, a spokesman for the society.
Though perhaps not as popular as stock options or signing bonuses, sabbaticals can be a carrot to recruit top talent or a reward to keep valued employees.
Mr. Lawrence added, though, that sabbaticals are a mixed blessing for companies.
"They may help attract people, but you can also lose people if they find a new job or career path while on sabbatical," he said.
Conversely, sabbaticals can also help a company ease out deadwood and disaffected or redundant workers. "We believe it can be a so-called downsizing tool," said Burke Stintson, AT&T's senior public relations manager. "'AT&T expects that a number of people will not return, a situation that would ease the need to downsize."
But the company says sabbaticals also offer growth opportunities for workers. Since 1992, about 1,500 AT&T employees have taken unpaid sabbaticals, which offer full benefits and a promise of a similar job when the workers return.
"We see it as a way for some people to better themselves and to bring new skills and perspectives back to our workplace," Mr. Stintson said.
Corporate sabbaticals are rarely as generous as their better-known academic counterparts. At many colleges and universities, a faculty member is entitled to a one-semester sabbatical with pay every six or seven years. Faculty members often extend their sabbaticals by taking a second semester off without pay.
Outside the ivory tower, shorter sabbaticals -- two weeks to three months -- are more common, and the required tenure may be less, sometimes just a few years. Corporate sabbaticals are much more likely to be unpaid, which can make them unaffordable for some employees; companies that offer paid sabbaticals may require that the time be used for community service or another specific purpose.
At the Segal Company, an employee benefits, compensation and human resources consulting firm based in Manhattan, employees are eligible for a one-month paid sabbatical after 10 years. (They get two months after 15 years and four months after 25 years.) Segal was one of the first companies to offer sabbaticals, in the early 1960's, and about 30 people have participated to date, said Robert Krinsky, the chairman and administrator of the sabbatical program.
The time off, though, may be used for any purpose: pursuing a hobby, painting the house or taking a course. Mr. Krinsky said an early participant at Segal was its founder, Martin E. Segal, who went to Paris in 1965 to study painting and reflect on the future of the company.
More recently, a senior consultant, Omar Saldana, visited Colombia to study the health care system there. Another employee, Jonathan Parker, just returned from two months visiting Thailand, Cambodia, England, Ireland and the south of France. In England, he studied local employee benefits programs.
Mr. Krinsky said that whether eligible employees took sabbaticals, and what they did with them, depended as much on their family circumstances as on their work situation.
"The Segal Company program was founded with two basic purposes in mind," he said. "First, a sabbatical should help you gain a new perspective on your work and life and learn some things that could be of use when you return. Second, it provides an opportunity for someone within the firm to have a higher-level position with greater responsibility, filling the position temporarily for the person on sabbatical."
These days, corporate sabbaticals are popular with technology companies like Intel and Apple, which compete fiercely for talent and where many employees work unusually hard. At Genentech, the biotechnology company in South San Francisco, Calif., full-time employees are eligible for a sabbatical of six continuous weeks with full pay and benefits, in addition to their regular vacation time, in their seventh year of employment. Sabbaticals can be delayed until the eighth year if dictated by business needs.
"The sabbatical program is one of several rewards given to employees in acknowledgment of the high level of intensive work and commitment required at Genentech," said Judy Heyboer, the company's president of human resources. In exchange for that commitment, she said, "we give back the incentive of a more significant break than is typically offered."
Using sabbaticals as a carrot can make sense for companies. "The biggest challenge that any company faces is attracting and keeping good people," said Mr. Phillips, whose employer, the Frank Russell Company, the pension consulting and money management firm in Tacoma, Wash., allows 10-year employees to take eight weeks of paid sabbatical. "If you can do that, most of the other problems are manageable. If you can't, the problems proliferate."
"Part of having a people-centered company is recognizing that balance is important in everyone's life," he added. "We don't celebrate 80-hour weeks around here. If fact, we think that the person who has to work like that is, in the long run, not very smart."
Mr. Ziegler's law firm, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, offers its 130 partners a sabbatical after every eight years' service as a partner. The minimum sabbatical is two months, fully compensated, combined with a month's vacation to yield three months away from the office; partners are permitted to take an additional two months' unpaid leave if they wish and if the firm's workload permits. The firm also offers associates a somewhat shorter sabbatical after four years' service.
Professional partnerships often do not offer sabbaticals, but Mr. Ziegler, who is spending the rest of his time teaching a seminar at Columbia Law School, said his employer's program benefited from the fact that the firm is "among the few major firms that determine partners' incomes purely by seniority, permitting partners to take time off without any anxiety over potentially adverse financial impact."
MR. ZIEGLER said one of the biggest benefits of a sabbatical was simply knowing that a long period of time off was ahead. "The change of pace offered by the sabbatical also, in effect, permits a risk-free, controlled mini-midlife crisis," he said. "It provides an opportunity to drastically change routine, experiment with something different, and then return to what one does best, hopefully refreshed and recharged."
He added that what he has chosen to do with his time -- devising and teaching a course entitled Ethical and Other Challenging Issues in Complex Litigation -- gave him time to reflect.
"I'm able to spend some time reflecting and thinking about -- in a thoughtful, nonadversarial setting -- many of the choices I make now almost automatically in a typical workweek when there often isn't much time to devote to them," he said, adding that the course could improve the firm's standing and thus help with the recruiting of law students at Columbia, "unless I really bomb out in the classroom."
The disadvantages, he said, include the backlog of work that he expects he will find upon his return in November. He is whittling away at it by having his assistant send some work and messages to him at home.
But that has been outweighed by the benefits, Mr. Ziegler said. He added that he was initially uncertain how to explain to clients that he was planning to leave them for three months. "Almost all of them were remarkably supportive, including many in-house counsel whose corporations wouldn't dream of offering such a wonderful midcareer benefit," he said.

No Mickey Mouse Union Protest at the Ice House

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
Some 50 union members began arriving in TriBeCa at 6:30 last Monday morning, a 20-foot inflated plastic rat by their side. They chanted and whistled, awakening neighborhood residents with the din. The reason? To make the point, said the protest organizer, Mike Hellstrom, that "nonunion contractors are rats."
The object of protesters' wrath was the Ice House, a loft conversion at 27 North Moore Street, between Varick and Hudson Streets, a block whose residents include John F. Kennedy Jr. and the actor Harvey Keitel. Mr. Hellstrom, a representative of Local 79 of the Construction and Building Laborers union, said he had chosen the building, where apartments sell for $600,000 to more than $1 million, because the contractor, Sam Strulovitch, has employed nonunion labor to do some interior demolition. 
 "The building and construction trades were instrumental in getting tax incentives for builders downtown," Mr. Hellstrom said, referring to the Downtown Revitalization Plan signed into law in 1995. "But now we're being locked out of a lot of the work being done." While the legislation covers only Manhattan south of Chambers Street, the use of nonunion workers occurs throughout the city, he said, an assertion echoed by Louis Coletti, chairman of the Building Trades Employers' Association, a group of 600 union contractors.
Mr. Coletti estimated that his members' share of city construction work has dwindled to no more than 50 percent from 60 or 70 percent in the 1980's. He blamed lower bids by nonunion concerns that "generally don't pay decent wages." He also said nonunion contractors take safety shortcuts.
Conceding that some subcontractors on the Ice House use nonunion workers, the Strulovitch company's vice president, Bill Van Salisbury, said he thought workers were adequately paid. He said that most were union members, including all the carpenters and electricians, and that no violations had been cited during recent visits by fire, buildings and sanitation inspectors.
Mr. Hellstrom insisted he would not end the protests or take down the rat until the entire Ice House project has been unionized. He pointed to a demonstration this spring in the Financial District, where nonunion workers were helping to convert a 24-story office building at 80 John Street to rental apartments. "We stayed there for 25 weeks," he said. "Finally, the developer agreed to use union labor on his next five projects." BERNARD STAMLER

A Master Plan for Copters

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
Irwin Suskind has lived in Brooklyn Heights since the 1960's, in an apartment overlooking lower Manhattan and the harbor. But only during the last few years has he really noticed the helicopters, swooping down from the sky like deafening birds of prey.
"It's like a highway outside my window," he said, noting that television, tourist, business and courier service choppers crisscross the area. "Sometimes, there are more than 30 flying by in an hour." 
 The problem has worsened since last month's eviction of National Helicopter, a tour operator, from the East 34th Street heliport in Manhattan, and the relocation of many of its flights to the Wall Street Heliport. So Mr. Suskind and other members of the Brooklyn Task Force on Helicopters say they hope for big things from the city's Economic Development Corporation.
The E.D.C. will hold its first public meeting at 6 P.M. on Tuesday at the Department of City Planning, 22 Reade Street in Lower Manhattan, to discuss the Heliport and Helicopter Master Plan it recently commissioned from a private company.
"We don't want a plan that's just going to push helicopters from one part of the city to another," said Karen Johnson, the chief of staff for Representative Edolphus Towns and the head of the helicopter task force. "We want a plan that makes sense."
An E.D.C. spokeswoman, Bernadette O'Leary, said the master plan would be "the first comprehensive study of the city's heliports as a system, and not just as individual sites." She said that the plan would provide a framework to reduce "nonessential" flights, referring to Mayor Giuliani's April pledge -- unfulfilled thus far -- to shut the East 60th Street heliport and cut total traffic by 30 to 40 percent.
In addition to the Wall Street, East 34th Street and 60th Street locations, there is an aging heliport at West 30th Street. Ms. O'Leary said that Pier 76, at West 35th Street, was being considered as a possible replacement site, but that it was too early to know just how many heliports would ultimately remain.
That is not good enough for some helicopter foes, like Joy Held of the Helicopter Noise Coalition of New York City, who said she was skeptical of the city's promises. Her group, which seeks an end to all helicopter flyovers, is suing the city to close the 34th Street heliport.
Ms. Held accused city officials of "shunning" group members in connection with the upcoming hearings, and said she had been told that they would not be welcome at a meeting Tuesday morning in Brooklyn led by Ms. Johnson.
Ms. Johnson's only comment was that she thought Ms. Held's goals were unrealistic. "All helicopter flights in New York City are not going to be banned," she said. "We need to have a meaningful dialogue with the city to construct the proper master plan." BERNARD STAMLER

Pennies Under the Bridge: 60-Year-Old Battle Winds Down

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF

 BODY:
A 60-year-old battle is coming to an end. The $1.75 one-way toll on the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, the only intraborough toll bridge in the city, is to be repealed in the next few weeks, the Mayor and the Governor's office said.
"It's going out, I guarantee it," Mayor Giuliani said last Tuesday in an interview on a campaign stop outside Continental Post No. 1424 of the American Legion Hall in Forest Hills. "It has been unfair that Queens residents should pay to get to Queens." 
 For more than a generation, residents of Broad Channel have waged a war of pennies, car blockades and civil disobedience to rid the half-mile bridge that links them to the Rockaway Peninsula of what they call "an abomination and an unfair tax." The small island community in Jamaica Bay shares a zip code and a high school with the peninsula, and many residents work there.
"We were a thorn," said Dan Tubridy, a big, cigar-smoking restaurateur who said he had been unfairly arrested six years ago for menacing, reckless endangerment and possession of a weapon (his car) in an altercation with a toll collector.
During his 1993 campaign, Mr. Giuliani, who is now campaigning for re-election, promised the people of Broad Channel that he would do what he could to revoke the toll. Some residents estimate that they spend $1,200 a year on the bridge.
Ending the toll would be the third break given to New York commuters this year. The Mayor has been assiduously courting the boroughs outside Manhattan, home to his base of Republicans and conservative Democrats. If he can deliver on his toll promise, it will be one of great significance to this economically depressed neighborhood, which overwhelmingly supported him in the last election.
The Mayor also suspended the toll on the Staten Island Ferry. And both he and Gov. George E. Pataki are trumpeting their roles in the elimination of the two-fare zone for bus and subway riders.
"It is a terrific thing," Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato said of the impending repeal of the bridge toll. "It's a relief for working people of New York, and the same kind of relief will come to Long Islanders."
The Governor, who has 5 of the 14 votes on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, which oversees the bridge, has lent his support to the Mayor's plan.
At the same time, the Mayor, who has four M.T.A. appointees, will support a one-fare zone for Nassau County commuters who transfer to city buses and subways, the Senator said. Mr. Giuliani's office did not return calls concerning the Nassau plan.
Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Michael McKeon, said: "The Governor has asked the M.T.A. to look at eliminating the toll on the Cross Bay Bridge, and we think it makes financial sense to do it."
The M.T.A. board is expected to vote on the matter on Sept. 30. "We have been investigating this possibility at the Governor's request and that of Queens Borough President Claire Shulman," Tom Kelly, an M.T.A. spokesman, said.
More than $6 million was collected on the bridge last year.
"It's politics," Audrey K. Pheffer, the local Democratic Assemblywoman, said of the repeal. "But it's exciting. We've been waiting a long time to not have to pay to get to our own homes." CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: STYLE NOIR

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
TROUBLE is big business this fall. If urban crime is down, urbane fear is on a roll -- in fashion, movies, books and home design. Hollywood and Seventh Avenue have introduced a sinister new lining to the American dream, and they are escorting it to the bank like a dry-eyed widow with a fat will in her purse.
The products have the hard-edge look that lurks better than ever: noir, pure and blood simple, with its cinematic sense of style, a world of black and white, light and shadow, where only crime is colorful and kisses kill. For people who think it's a hard reboil of the 1950's, noir and its unseen terrors have never been more timely. 
 "People are afraid of random chaos," said James Ellroy, the author of "My Dark Places," a memoir of his mother's murder in 1958. "Car-jackings, serial killers, the proliferation of guns -- they're afraid of all the stuff they see on the evening news."
He added: "People like darkness, and they like touching it. Noir is a way of experiencing it and gaining thrill from it and remaining safe from it at the same time."
The first of a wave of noir-influenced movies, "L.A. Confidential," based on an Ellroy novel and set in 1950's Los Angeles, is to open on Friday with an all-star cast of corrupt cops and Kim Basinger as a Veronica Lake look-alike. Hard on its heels in October is Oliver Stone's "U-Turn," starring Sean Penn as a con man trapped in a small desert town.
Noir's cool voiceover is narrating new tough talk for fashion, too, after the failure of the waif look. Innocence was just too hard to pull off in the 1990's. Tom Ford's fall collection for Gucci features a 40's monkey-fur jacket the color of a Malibu-motel crime-scene swimming pool, a black leather suit in which to answer the postman's second ring and five-inch Saturday night special metal stilettos that look more like handguns than shoes. Fendi and Ralph Lauren are also doing silver metal heels.
Voyeurism, noir's signature viewpoint, informs the ads. Gucci's images have been shot from video monitors to give them the distrusting look of surveillance. Cerruti's new ads are grainy caught-in-car-headlights photos of a couple on the run -- from what and from whom?
"What looks good to our eye right now is harder and more violent," Mr. Ford said. "Our lives are more violent. The last thing you want to look like is vulnerable. Grace Kelly's 50's wouldn't work today."
Home design has made the ransom-note pickup with "Dial M for Murder" black Bakelite-style telephones in the Pottery Barn catalogue and black metal oscillating fans to blow your nails dry before you dial.
Music is also in a dark mood. The pop stylist Carly Simon plays femme fatale on "Film Noir," an album to be released on Tuesday. It includes songs from films like Otto Preminger's "Laura" and sensual standards like "Don't Smoke in Bed." A documentary on making the album, "Songs in Shadow," is to benefit American Movie Classics for the preservation of noir films.
All this is just in time for noir's literary canonization. Eleven classic American noir novels from the 40's and 50's, including Jim Thompson's "The Killer Inside Me" and Cornell Woolrich's "I Married a Dead Man," will stand beside Poe and Faulkner in October in the Library of America series.
Why noir now? Like the boom of the post-World War II 1940's and 50's, the future seems bright. The economy is good, the land is happy.
But seeing is not believing. Nothing understood this better than the style of noir.
"Optimism can be both created and exploited," said Curtis Hanson, who directed "L.A. Confidential," which is set in what Mr. Hanson called "the forward-looking 50's" of his childhood in Los Angeles. Mr. Hanson used songs like Johnny Mercer's "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive" and vocalists like Dean Martin and Chet Baker -- popular today as lounge-culture music -- to convey a postwar America trying to laugh at the threat of nuclear holocaust.
"It's all about looking on the bright side," Mr. Hanson said. "When you can't ignore the negative, you repress it. What speaks to our country more today than repression?"
As the production designer for "L.A. Confidential," Jeannine Oppewall dealt with the deceptively sunny surface of Los Angeles directly. "There's no sun without night," she said. Ms. Oppewall recalls her first few months in Hollywood in the 1970's, when the police knocked on her door one morning.
"Madam, haven't you noticed the dead body in the car parked at the end of your driveway?" they asked.
"Somebody had been murdered and abandoned in a car in front of my house," she said.
" 'L.A. Confidential' was a story that on the surface looked pretty nice and normal but, once you got into the bowels of it, was kind of decadent and decaying," she said.
N OIR'S dark observations of an unseen world larger than the moral universe look uncannily prescient. Only the most gifted cynics, like the creators of the original noir story style, could have written today's headlines of child beauty queen stranglings and spree killers. Street crime may be down statistically in major cities, but the perception of crime -- and of its perversity -- is heightened. Skepticism about the police and the Government breed anxiety despite what should be reassuring official statistics.
"Certainly, we live in an age of cynicism in which people are deeply suspicious about what the Government tells them," said Andrew Karmen, a professor of criminology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.
The absence of belief in leadership, he suggests, has created its own kind of modern anxieties. As the future brightens statistically in the news, the shadows deepen in the public consciousness.
"There's a fear that the whole thing -- the good news of the stock market, the low crime rate -- is a bubble," said Charles Bahn, a psychologist at John Jay.
The alternative is to take comfort in imagining the worst.
"Noir confirms our anxieties that the inverse may be brewing beneath the surface," Dr. Bahn said, citing corporate downsizing as an example of cultural paranoia. It is also the topic of "The Axe," a 90's noir novel by Donald Westlake. The killer is middle management.
"The economy is good in The Wall Street Journal," Dr. Bahn said. "How do you square that with being told your job no longer exists? We've added darker motives to daily life. Violence and betrayal in conventional, ordinary relationships -- that's what noir has to offer, the hidden motives of people we deal with on a day-to-day basis."
Noir's stylish cynicism has never looked better as a sales tool.
"What you're looking for," reads the copy at the bottom of a Camel cigarette ad, which features a dark-lidded, 1990's femme fatale behind a martini glass in a shadowy lounge. The copy at the top of the picture is the Surgeon General's warning, in letters as large as the sales pitch. What you may be looking for is a good excuse to smoke. And noir has it -- a kind of armed and glamorous, name-your-poison approach.
"Camel is embracing night life and sophistication and an urban feeling," said Richard Williams, a spokesman for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. "We think urban night life and sophistication are more of an attitude than a geographic location."
It is. It is noir's classic landscape -- the city of night. Where the enemy within lives, not the girl next door.
I THINK AIDS has changed our perceptions of beauty," Mr. Ford of Gucci said. "In the late 70's, who were the most beautiful girls? Patty Hanson, Cheryl Tiegs. They looked like they wanted to be kissed. They were touchable."
But the casual act has become frightening; fashion is dressing the fear. "Now, people still want to look sexy, but there's a danger to it," he said. "The look is, 'Yes, kiss me, but I might kill you, too.' "
If modern life appears to imitate noir's art, the low life of noir has established itself as a respectable genre of 20th-century American art. The lonely, moral vacancy in paintings by Edward Hopper, the absolved grotesques of Diane Arbus's photographs, the lurid triumph of television as a cultural denominator, all touch a noir nerve.
"It's become clear that the noir tradition, whether in novels or movies, really is the dominant style of the American 20th century," said Geoffrey O'Brien, executive editor of the Library of America. "It pulls together all the big themes of the power of money and corruption and sexual obsession -- and a kind of craziness. It has seeped so much into the culture that it's like a vocabulary for people to use."
As pulp literature for the computer age, the next great body of noir is being written on the Internet -- by amateurs. Faceless, amoral, unknowable, the Internet is basically a noir experience, a descending trip to an underworld of tipoffs and titillations, a blind date with paranoia, a mirror world like the final scene in "The Lady From Shanghai," Orson Welles's noir classic: in a mirrored funhouse, what the killer finally stalks is himself.
"Noir isn't crime so much as it's existential dilemma," said Luc Sante, author of "Evidence," a book of archival police photographs published in 1992. "It's about isolation and wide-ranging but unspecific fear -- a kind of fear of being."
Mr. Sante, at one time a fixture on the New York downtown club circuit, now spends half his year upstate.
"One of the reasons I'm not in the city is that the mood is cutthroat," Mr. Sante said. "There's not a lot of peace and love in the air. Crime may be down, but the mood of benevolent fellow feeling is down even further."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
A New Labyrinth For Phone Customers

BYLINE: By LAURA KOSS-FEDER 

 BODY:
YOU may think you're seeing things when your phone bill shows that calls to a friend in a neighboring town are more expensive than calls to your sister on the other coast.
Your eyesight isn't failing, but don't despair: There are ways to save money on your regional phone bills. 
 For a dozen years, regional phone service was a monopoly of the regional Bell companies created by the breakup of the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984. But with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was intended to open local and regional service to long-distance companies, a sometimes-bewildering choice of providers and plans is being offered for regional calling.
Long-distance carriers like AT&T, MCI and Sprint have started providing regional service, and the regional Bell companies have responded to the competition with rate cuts.
Consumers will find that it pays to shop around in today's $6 billion residential regional market. While consumers vary greatly in their calling patterns, it is not impossible that a household with moderate phone usage will be able to save 10 to 40 percent on its regional phone bill.
"One of the goals of the Telecommunications Act is to provide competition for local and regional phone service," said Tracy Waldon, an economist with the Federal Communications Commission. "Consumers will ultimately be able to see a drop in these rates, just like they did with long-distance rates." In fact, since the AT&T breakup, which paved the way for competition in the long-distance market, phone rates have come down by 50 percent, Mr. Waldon said.
Regional calls are those placed within one of the country's 199 Local Access and Transport Areas. A LATA can be statewide in a small state; there are multiple LATA's in larger states. (California has 11.) A regional call may be from New York City to White Plains in Westchester County, or from Miami to Boca Raton, Fla. And LATA's are not necessarily based on area code boundaries.
WHEN you set up your phone service, your local carrier is required to ask you to select a long-distance carrier, thus flagging the consumer to the possibility of a choice. But depending on the state, such a warning need not be made regarding regional calling. As a result, many people are not aware that there is now a choice.
"You should check out all the various regional rate plans being offered, especially if you make a high volume of calls," said Eric Strumingher, first vice president and telecommunications analyst with Paine Webber in New York.
MCI announced a plan in June that offers 24-hour flat-rate regional calling with savings of 15 percent to 59 percent over existing regional tolls, depending on location, said a spokesman, Brad Burns. The plan is being offered in all states but Alaska.
In California, MCI's new regional calling rate is 4 cents a minute, which MCI says is 42 percent lower than Pacific Bell's average basic rate. A five-minute evening call with Pacific Bell from San Jose to San Francisco is 52 cents; the same call for MCI customers is 20 cents, MCI said.
The search for cheaper service isn't always easy. The regional plans often vary widely, with a low teaser rate offered for weekend night or late-night calls only. Or there may be fine print noting that a low rate is available only for those who pay a monthly access charge or whose regional bills reach a certain number of calls or minutes.
Such apples-and-oranges pricing is pointed up by Pacific Bell's response to MCI's assertions about its California rates.
"MCI's rates may be a little lower than ours, but these claims are way out of proportion," said a Pacific Bell spokesman, John Britton. "They're comparing their lowest possible rates to Pac Bell's highest rate."
One trouble with the new competitors is that customers often need to dial a cumbersome five-digit code to use a provider other than a local Bell company for regional phone service. This practice varies state to state.
The easier way, of course, is to have customers choose a regional carrier and then allow them to use the current simple dialing method: a "1" followed by an area code and a telephone number, known as "one-plus dialing." Currently, 16 states have one-plus dialing; the other 34 require the use of access codes in some areas.
Each state's public service commission decides when to roll out one-plus dialing. It was mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, however, that when Bell companies enter the long-distance market, they must also provide one-plus dialing for all other carriers that offer regional calling to their customers. Currently, Bell companies are not in the long-distance market.
Another big long-distance company, Sprint, started offering lower regional rates in 1996 in states that have one-plus dialing. These rates vary from 5 cents to 30 cents a minute, depending on location and time of day, said Joseph Mandacini, senior marketing manager.
Again, Sprint and Bell Atlantic make claims and counterclaims on regional services.
In New York State, Mr. Mandacini said, customers who use Sprint's intra-LATA service can save 29 percent over Bell Atlantic's rates, with further reductions expected.
In response, a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman, Joan Rasmussen, said: "They're comparing apples to oranges. Companies can make all kinds of claims, but consumers should check for themselves."
AT&T's One-Rate plan offers set prices per minute for regional and long-distance calls, saving consumers 10 to 40 percent on these calls over their regional Bell rates, said Jack McMaster, vice president for growth markets, consumer markets division. AT&T's regional service is offered in 14 states and in parts of 22 others.
As in long-distance calling, some of the companies are household names, while others are smaller and may offer cheaper services. LCI International, a provider of long-distance service and voice and data transmission services based in McLean, Va., announced plans in July to offer regional one-plus calling in select regions in 23 states, said Roy Gamse, senior vice president for business marketing. The service, he added, could save customers up to 30 percent on these calls. In areas without one-plus dialing, customers must dial a separate five-digit code.
In New York, a highly competitive market, Bell Atlantic offers a variety of plans to customers, depending on their past calling patterns. One Bell Atlantic customer in New York City who makes few calls has an "unlimited regional calling plan" that includes unlimited calls to Westchester and Long Island for a flat monthly charge of $6, coupled with unlimited local calls at $1.63 a month. At another extreme, a Westchester resident without an unlimited plan might pay Bell Atlantic's "basic local services" charge of about $10 monthly, plus $30 for about six hours of calls within the region in a month.
Local phone companies around the country have been gradually lowering their regional rates and these are worth a closer look, Mr. Strumingher noted. While long-distance providers, in some cases, can still offer more competitive regional rates than the local carriers, the gap is narrowing.
But again, the choices can be bewildering: in one Pacific Bell plan, customers receive a 30 percent discount on all calls up to $45 a month, and a 40 percent reduction if calls total more than $45 -- at a charge of $4.50 a month.
 
Searching Out Your Best Deal
So you think you may want to change your regional phone carrier but are totally confused about which carrier to choose?
You are probably not alone. Just remember the days when long-distance service was first deregulated, and you were bombarded with offers from a host of new competitors. Many people didn't know where to turn then, either.
Following are some tips to help you decide which company should provide your regional calling:
* Understand and analyze your regional calling patterns. Do you make most of your calls on weekends and evenings. Are you mostly calling just one or two phone numbers? Are your phone calls lengthy? The answers can help you select a plan that will save money each month.
* Shop around. Ask carriers about their different plans and select the one that best suits your regional calling habits.
For instance, under certain circumstances, Bell Atlantic offers a flat rate as low as $6.28 a month, or 2.1 cents a minute, if you're a New York City resident who makes five hours of regional calls a month. That is only a weekend evening rate, however. An MCI plan, on the other hand, would cost $30 a month, or 10 cents a minute, for the same amount of calls. The advantage is that MCI's offer is a 24-hour flat-rate plan. Smaller carriers are in the market, too.
* Check the fine print. You'll see ads for regional carriers or dial-around services (dialing 1 plus a five-digit code). But some carriers give a low, flat-minute rate in their ads and fail to note that you must pay an access charge or make a minimum number of calls or minimum length of call to get a certain rate.
* Bargain for better deals. When telemarketers call you, ask them if they can do better than the offers that have been quoted.

HEADLINE: A Chief Banker for Nations At the Bottom of the Heap

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A FEW months ago, James D. Wolfensohn, the wealthy former investment banker who heads the World Bank, stood in a teeming hillside ghetto in Rio de Janeiro, watching people who had never had running water experience the simple pleasure of opening a tap.
The World Bank had teamed up with poverty-fighting organizations, the city government, the water company and local residents to install simple sewage and water lines. The project, Mr. Wolfensohn was told, had created a profitable new market for the water company, improved health and freed thousands of women in the community from the crippling daily ritual of dragging buckets of water up from the bottom of the hill. 
 On a global scale, it was a tiny victory for the World Bank, which has had only intermittent success in decades of struggle to bring hope and improved living standards to the world's poorest nations. But for Mr. Wolfensohn, who has led the much-criticized international agency for two years, it was a moment that brought to life how the bank can and should work.
Unlike many huge development projects that have given the agency a black eye, this one was of a manageable scale, and it made economic sense. It combined private investment with World Bank expertise. It could be replicated elsewhere. And it had the support and involvement not just of governments and other official bodies but also of the people it was trying to help.
"I would watch the women turn on the water, and sometimes they would cry, but always it would be with happiness," Mr. Wolfensohn recounted in one of two long interviews this summer. "I cried, because how can you not? You see hope in the eyes of people. You see women who had been wracked with arthritis now able to stand up. You feel that as a member of the bank you helped make this happen."
But if his trip to Brazil was heartening, it was no more than a brief interlude in his battle to arrest the bank's loss of influence, improve its record in fighting global poverty and assure its survival as the flagship of international development agencies.
There is more at stake than the World Bank's reputation. The entire development field, in which the bank is the biggest and most influential player, is under scrutiny as never before, in both rich nations and poor. Critics say the many hundreds of billions of dollars in development aid have failed abysmally in efforts to build foundations for sustainable economic growth in many regions. Even supporters acknowledge that results have been disappointing in too many countries.
"Development, particularly in Africa, is the pre-eminent moral challenge facing mankind, and the World Bank's role has never been more important," said Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, a former chief economist at the bank.
It is too early for Mr. Wolfensohn's efforts to have had any significant effect on the bank's record; by its own accounting, a third of the projects it backs fail to create any enduring benefits. But through charm, exhortation and occasional bullying, he has clearly focused the institution on the big question of what role it should play at a time when official development efforts have been discredited by their own spotty record and are being made increasingly irrelevant by huge pools of private capital flowing into developing nations.
What Western democracies once considered third-world countries, battlegrounds against Communism as much as against poverty, are now defined as emerging markets. And the World Bank, long viewed by critics on the left as embodying the worst of colonialist tendencies, is being hammered by critics on the right as a crutch for corrupt and weak-willed governments and as a barrier to the spread of free markets and democratic capitalism.
Balancing such countervailing pressures even as he seeks to remake the institution requires something of a high-wire act from Mr. Wolfensohn, and opinions inside and outside the bank vary about whether he can pull it off.
"It's an irrelevant institution trying to find a role in today's world," said Ian Vasquez, an economist at the Cato Institute who says the World Bank's policies too often impede the development of market economies. "No amount of internal reform will change that."
But even some of the harshest critics give Mr. Wolfensohn credit for a passionate commitment to the cause of fighting poverty and for forcing some wrenching and needed changes on the bank.
"He genuinely wants to make a difference and to make his mark by turning the bank around and making it an institution that effectively tackles poverty," said Justin Forsyth, the director of Oxfam International, one of the biggest nongovernmental organizations working on development programs around the world.
"He's a breath of fresh air," Mr. Forsyth said. "The big question mark is whether he can deliver in practice, whether the reality will match the rhetoric."
AFTER just 26 months on the job, Mr. Wolfensohn, 63, has become the most activist and publicly visible president the institution has had since Robert S. McNamara stepped down in 1981. A stocky native of Australia with an unruly shock of white hair, Mr. Wolfensohn comes from a background that defies easy categorization.
He made a fortune on Wall Street and enjoys trappings of great wealth like a private jet and a lavish vacation home in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Yet he talks of a deep sense of compassion for the poor that is rooted in his family's financial woes during his childhood. He spent a career advising many of the world's most unapologetic capitalists, but built a long record of involvement in social, environmental and philanthropic causes. Erudite and tireless, he can also be impatient and thin-skinned when things don't go his way, colleagues say.
Without question, he has managed to give the bank's culture a jolt. He has encouraged top officials to move from Washington to the countries they are responsible for helping. He is requiring hundreds of senior managers to go through several weeks of business-school-style courses on how companies that fail to adapt to change tend to land on the ash heap of history. The courses are followed by a week's stay in a poor village or slum to reinforce what the bank's efforts are all about.
As many as 700 people, or 7 percent of the bank's work force, could lose their jobs in a continuing reorganization intended to make the agency more nimble and efficient. And Mr. Wolfensohn has made clear that advancement at the bank will no longer be based on success in getting loans approved by the board, but by the long-term success of loan programs in improving living standards.
Mr. Wolfensohn has also begun laying out a vision for the bank that calls for it to shed its somewhat arrogant self-image as the center of the development world. He wants the bank to see itself as a facilitator and partner -- with governments, with other development agencies, with grass-roots groups and other nongovernmental organizations and, perhaps most important, with the companies, investors and other sources of private capital that have transformed Asia and Latin America and are doing so to varying degrees elsewhere in the world.
As an international financier, Mr. Wolfensohn starts with the assumption that the bank should encourage foreign investment.
In 1990, official development assistance from all sources totaled $56.3 billion, compared with $44.4 billion in private capital sent to emerging markets. By last year, private capital flows had swollen to $243.8 billion -- nearly a sixfold increase -- while official development aid had dropped to $40.8 billion, almost half of it from the World Bank.
"It stands to reason that if our money is limited and there is great potential for the private sector, we must think in terms not just of what we do but how we can leverage what we do with the private sector," Mr. Wolfensohn said.
BUT his faith in markets has its limits. He is quick to note that three-quarters of the private capital flowing to developing nations goes to a dozen countries, with nearly a quarter going to China alone, leaving vast regions of the world untouched.
Moreover, private capital does little to address issues like health and education. And private investment tends to flow mostly to countries that have used development aid and expertise to build not just basic public works like roads and electrical systems but also sound economic policies and stable institutions like courts and banking systems.
So, while Mr. Wolfensohn sees a role for the bank in continuing to finance the infrastructure projects that have been its trademark, he is eager to speed its shift toward weaving an economic fabric for a country through smaller-scale but integrated programs that are economically sustainable, environmentally benign and embraced by those people they purport to help.
In the past, the prototypical project required much of the bank's money and technical expertise -- say, a hydroelectric dam or other concrete artifact of modernization. In some cases, those projects brought measurable improvements in standards of living, but often they wreaked environmental havoc and proved to be economic boondoggles.
These days, the bank has a big program under way to forgive some debts that poor countries ran up with the encouragement or approval of international aid agencies, including the bank itself. And a typical bank project might be the $12.8 million loan it made last year to Kenya to clean up Lake Victoria and help the fishing and farming communities on its shores. Or the $16.8 million loan to the former Soviet republic of Moldova to train teachers and buy textbooks. Or the $10.7 million loan to help Ecuador change its judicial system. Or the $4.7 million irrigation program for small farmers in Mali.
"The issue in the old days was getting projects done," Mr. Wolfensohn said. "Getting individual projects done today, unless you scale them up, is not going to solve the problems of poverty and inequality and social justice.
"You can help people make crops grow. But if you don't have roads to get them out, microcredits to finance them, facilities to store them and advice on marketing, then improving crop yields is not going to affect the national scene."
WORLD BANK presidents since Mr. McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense who took over in 1968, have tried to respond to criticism about the institution's approach.
But none came into office with the sense of urgency that greeted Mr. Wolfensohn two years ago. A new Republican majority in Congress was attacking foreign aid in general. And to mark the anniversary of the founding of the bank and the International Monetary Fund in 1944, activist groups from around the world had mounted a long campaign proclaiming that "50 years is enough" for the two institutions, or at least for the policies they represented.
The bank's shift in emphasis from lending for big infrastructure projects toward social and environmental programs had begun some years earlier. But Mr. Wolfensohn has sought to accelerate and expand the bank's metamorphosis. One of his main efforts has been to reach out to the hundreds of environmental, human rights and poverty-fighting organizations that have long worked alongside the bank and been among its fiercest critics.
Mr. Wolfensohn has urged his managers to include the organizations in any projects where they may be helpful. The World Wildlife Fund, for example, is helping the bank develop an approach to forest management. And a coalition of more than 500 organizations has agreed to join an 18-month program to assess the effectiveness of the bank's policies in seven nations.
MR. WOLFENSOHN has also tried to respond to criticism from poor nations that the bank too often imposes solutions from above, rather than listening to people most affected by its policies. Confronted with complaints last year from African officials about the bank's approach, Mr. Wolfensohn told them to come up with their own ideas. They brought him a plan that is now serving as the blueprint for many of the bank's activities.
"They said that all we did was bring in foreign advisers, pay them enormous amounts of money, drive around in Land Rovers, give technical assistance and then leave," Mr. Wolfensohn said.
With the Africans' own report now guiding policy, "it's very clear whose program this is now," he continued. "They will never be able to say we came up with the wrong program -- and there's every chance they came up with the right program."
Many outsiders, though, believe that Mr. Wolfensohn is only modifying the bank's policies around the edges. Doug Hellinger, who heads the Development Group for Alternative Policies, a consortium of nongovernmental organizations, said Mr. Wolfensohn, perhaps constrained by the rich nations that dominate the bank's board, remained too wedded to the idea that globalization will bring prosperity to poor workers and farmers around the world. Current bank policies, he said, will exploit the most vulnerable around the world, leading to a downward spiral in living standards and working conditions.
"He has a personality that can help force change, but the strategy he's pursuing is not going to work," Mr. Hellinger said. "It's going to be an opportunity wasted. It's a shame."
IN many ways, Mr. Wolfensohn has been training for this job his entire life. Born in Sydney to parents who had emigrated from Britain, he grew up in a home without much money but in an atmosphere that encouraged a love for music and the arts and that instilled in him a drive for accomplishment and security.
Encouraged by some friends while in college to take up fencing, he pushed hard enough to make the Australian Olympic team within a few years. After receiving a law degree and being chided by an American colleague for his lack of business expertise, he went off to Harvard Business School and received an M.B.A. in 1959.
After rising through a number of Australian and British investment banks, he landed at Salomon Brothers in New York in 1977. Within a few years he had come to national prominence by helping to engineer the bailout of the Chrysler Corporation. He had also indulged his passion for classical music, taking up the cello and becoming chairman of Carnegie Hall. In addition, he became a trustee of the Population Council and the Rockefeller Foundation and traveled to one of the first worldwide environmental conferences.
In 1980, hearing that Mr. McNamara had included him on a list of possible successors for the World Bank presidency -- a job that traditionally goes to an American on the recommendation of the President -- Mr. Wolfensohn quickly became an American citizen.
He did not get the job that time around. Instead, he left Salomon to found his own firm so that he would have more freedom to pursue outside interests. The firm, James D. Wolfensohn Inc., which put 20 percent of its profits into charitable causes, became one of the hottest mergers-and-acquisitions advisers of the 1980's and early 90's. (It is now part of Bankers Trust.)
When President Clinton offered him the World Bank job, he never hesitated, and for all the frustrations and intense criticism he has faced, he says the job is all he hoped for.
"I have had terrible times and I still have them, and I wander out of here some days wondering why I'm not in Jackson Hole, fishing," Mr. Wolfensohn said. "But it doesn't last very long. I have a passionate belief in this organization. We can make a difference between peace and war. We can make a difference between poverty and a fair life for people.
"I'm not saying we can solve all the problems, but we can make a difference," he said. "You may think that's stupid, but it's why I'm here."
 
Billions to Lend, but No Tellers
THE World Bank has no tellers, cash machines or checking accounts, and it does not offer mortgages or car loans.
Instead, through several subsidiaries, it channels about $20 billion a year in loans and a limited amount of investment capital into projects around the world.
One unit, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is self-financing, raises money by issuing bonds backed by 180 member nations. It then lends the money to the governments of nations that, while poor, are capable of repaying the loans at near-market interest rates that yield a profit for the bank.
The poorest of nations are offered long-term, interest-free loans through another subsidiary, the International Development Association. Since these loans are unprofitable, they require financing from rich nations. This year, the United States contributed $700 million to the subsidiary, although conservative Republicans disputed the value of such assistance.
Another unit, the International Finance Corporation, makes relatively small equity investments in business ventures to foster entrepreneurship and job creation.
And through yet another unit, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the World Bank helps encourage private investment in developing countries by issuing loan guarantees, protecting investors against political risks like war and expropriation. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Israeli Market Seems Solid Despite Turmoil

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THE terrorist bombing in Jerusalem on Sept. 4 prompted a flurry of diplomatic reaction in Israel and the United States, but the latest political unrest has had little effect on Israeli stocks and even less on portfolio managers, who remain optimistic about Israeli companies and their future.
"A few years ago, terrorist attacks like the one that happened in Jerusalem would have had a pronounced effect on stocks, particularly those that trade in Israel," said Robert Goldman, an analyst specializing in Israeli stocks at Josephthal Lyon & Ross in Washington. 
 "The market was less mature, and political risk in stocks was much greater. Now, investors who have invested in the area realize their prospects are more determined by fundamentals within the company and the industry as opposed to the political scene."
Indeed, the last two and a half years have been replete with violence and unrest, including the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. But the country's Mishtanim stock index, which bottomed in March 1995, has moved up steadily.
Gains this year have been particularly strong and have much more to do with economic fundamentals than with politics, analysts say.
Since the start of the year, the Mishtanim, which comprises 100 blue-chip companies, is up 27 percent in dollar terms.
A decline in the Israeli Government's budget deficit, promises that it will fall more next year and a big cut in interest rates early this summer seem more important to investors than do the violent twists and turns of the peace process.
"While the peace process is important, equally important for investors is a genuine commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit in Israel," said Richard Watt, chief investment officer of the $91.9 million First Israel fund.
"I thought it instructive that the market rallied as budget cuts were announced on Sept. 8. In the past, investors were concerned that loose fiscal policy would lead to higher-than-warranted interest rates."
On the surface, it appears that investors in Mr. Watt's closed-end fund are concerned about something, however, because even though the net asset value is up 36 percent since the start of the year, the fund trades at a discount to that value.
Mr. Watt said the gap had more to do with nervousness over world events of the last six weeks among investors in international and emerging-markets funds than with anything specifically related to Israel.
"We need to separate out the market impact and issues related to closed-end funds," he said.
"Generally, all have experienced a widening of discounts over the last few weeks. With the Asian crisis, less money has been flowing into international and emerging markets funds."
Michael Porter, a closed-end country fund analyst at Smith Barney, recommended buying First Israel fund shares back in January. He has not changed his view.
"I guess I'm an optimist," he said in an interview from Paris. "I take the view that it is a high-tech kind of a market in an area where peace, notwithstanding cafe bombs, is progressing. In addition, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu got through a budget that promises to reduce the deficit. They are moving in the right direction, and that is encouraging."
DESPITE the run-up in stock prices, Mr. Watt and other analysts believe Israeli stocks have more room to appreciate.
"Not many people have exposure to Israel," he said. "It is instructive to know that Israel will go into the Morgan Stanley International index in November," with a weighting of about 2 percent, he added. "The experience has been that the mere inclusion of a market in the benchmark leads to renewed interest."
There are a number of ways to invest in Israeli companies.
Aside from mutual funds like the First Israel fund or the Foreign and Colonial Emerging Market Middle East fund, a closed-end fund with about 13 percent of its $58 million in assets invested in Israel, about 85 Israeli companies are listed on United States stock exchanges. Some 10 times that many trade in Israel.
"We choose to focus on the stocks traded here" in the United States, Mr. Goldman said, "because there is more liquidity, better access to information and less currency risk."
So far this year, the 11 Israeli stocks Mr. Goldman has rated a "buy" are up an average 44 percent.
His current recommendations include Gilat Satellite Networks, a maker of satellite stations and hubs; Tecnomatix Technologies, a software company, and Orbotech Ltd. The manufacturer of electro-optical systems remains a favorite even though it has more than tripled this year.
Investors concerned about minimizing their exposure to political risk in Israel might consider a company like ZAG Industries, said Marcel Houtzager, an analyst at Wanger Asset Management in Chicago. An exporter of tool boxes and do-it-yourself items to chains like Home Depot, ZAG is fairly immune to domestic political developments.
In a report issued before the Jerusalem bombings, analysts at Smith Barney raised their rankings on Israel's attractiveness as an investment site.
"Of the 25 emerging markets we cover, Israel currently is ranked fourth, behind Colombia, Venezuela and Poland," said Brian Gendreau, an emerging-markets strategist.
"Primarily, we like it because valuations there look attractive, corporate earnings are moving higher and economic growth forecasts for 1998 have been raised."
Among the companies Mr. Gendreau singled out were ECI Telecom Ltd., a telecommunications equipment company, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, a drug company.
Mr. Watt also likes Teva, the second-largest holding of the First Israel fund, as well as a number of Israeli banks, which are in the process of being privatized by the Government. Among these are Bank Hapoalim, which was bought by a group of investors last week, and Bank Leumi, the next big Israeli financial institution to be privatized.
Jeff Chowdhry, who manages the Foreign and Colonial Emerging Market Middle East fund in London, is positive but not wildly enthusiastic about Israeli stocks. At the moment, prices are "fairly" valued, he said.
The market Mr. Chowdhry likes a lot is Egypt's, one that stands to benefit no matter how the peace process unfolds in Israel.
"Egypt is our favorite market in the Middle East," he said. "The Government has embarked on a very aggressive privatization program; earnings growth is expected to be very, very good for the next couple of years, and Egyptian stocks look undervalued."
Turning to politics, Mr. Chowdhry said that, as a "relative neutral, " Egypt would look better to investors than would other nations in the region should tensions continue to mount.
"And if there is an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization," he said, "then Egypt wins, too."

The portfolio of the First Israel fund has risen sharply this year, as measured by its net asset value. But shares of the closed-end fund are trading at a steep discount to the value of the fund's portfolio. American investors appear to be more pessimistic about world events in other international and emerging markets than in Israel.

HEADLINE: Real Life in Bulgaria

 BODY:

To the Editor:
What conceivable perspective would support a report's conclusion that Bulgaria outranks the United States in quality of life (news article, Sept. 7)? 
 Richard J. Estes of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Social Work is quoted as saying that "Bulgaria enjoys the legacy of social provision that characterized all of the states and partners of the former Soviet Union, i.e., high literacy, high access to at least basic health care, guaranteed housing."
For most of its people, however, Bulgaria is not responding to these needs. During the political and economic crisis this past spring, bread, gasoline and health care were virtually nonexistent.
Housing for many Bulgarians is a crumbling block with little heat and sometimes no water or electricity. Any comparison of countries should be based on real conditions, not on the failed promises of the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: AT THE GATE;
Avis vs. Hertz: Investors, Start Your Calculators

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
EVEN as an investment, Avis Rent-a-Car looks destined to be No. 2. The Hertz Corporation, its longtime rival, dominates the rental car business, with $3.8 billion in sales. And when the Ford Motor Company spun off part of Hertz last April at $24 a share, the stock ended its first day nearly $4 higher and has gone on to gain 24 percent more.
Now Avis, the second-largest company in the market, is planning its own public debut. By the end of the month, Avis is expected to sell 19.5 million shares, at $15 to $17 each, in its initial public offering. The company, which is based in Garden City, N.Y., expects to use the $312 million it raises to pay off some of its debt. 
 Avis commands about 25 percent of the rental car market, and Hertz, about 29 percent. Among the other competitors in the market are Budget Group, which owns Budget Rent-a-Car, and Republic Industries, which recently scooped up National and Alamo.
Like Hertz, Avis is expected to benefit from the improving environment in the rental car business, which has increased by about 11 percent a year since 1992.
"The fundamentals are going to be very good for both of them," said John W. Ballen, a portfolio manager for Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston. "If you like Hertz, you're going to like Avis."
Rental car companies, which were once largely a dumping ground for the car makers but are now more independent, have been more concerned about making money and have been able to raise their rates. As a result, they have started to enjoy higher levels of profitability. "It's hard to believe it's going to stall out right now," Mr. Ballen said.
HFS Inc. bought Avis last October as part of its strategy of collecting brands and building an extensive network of franchises. Along with General Motors, Avis employees owned most of Avis, which was bought for about $800 million in a combination of cash and HFS stock. The deal seemed generous at the time, but it looks more like a bargain today -- and it seems to demonstrate a remarkable sense of timing on the part of Henry R. Silverman, the chief executive of HFS.
"They had the vision that the industry was changing," said Mr. Ballen, who noted that the acquisition was made before National and Alamo were sold and before Hertz went public with so much success. "It was a brilliant move buying then."
But for investors who worry about unexpected curves, Hertz looks like an easier ride than Avis. Especially because so few other well-known companies are now going public, the Avis offering is expected to be popular, but it seems to be riskier because Avis is less profitable and more laden with debt than No. 1 and may be more vulnerable in a downturn.
MOREOVER, HFS is selling only some of the company. It is keeping its Wizard reservation system and the Avis name, and is charging Avis a royalty fee of 4 percent to 4.5 percent of its revenues for the use of the name.
Avis "is a big name, but the fact is that they don't own the name," said Ken Fleming, an analyst with Renaissance Capital, a company in Greenwich, Conn., that researches and invests in initial public offerings. Mr. Fleming prefers Hertz stock.
All that investors will be buying is a 70 percent stake in Avis's rental car business, which consists of 536 rental sites, mostly in the United States, and had revenues of $1.93 billion for the last 12 months.
Thus, Hertz and Avis "are really kind of two different operations," said Dan Donovan, a senior analyst for American Express Financial Advisers. He likens Hertz to a franchise, like McDonald's, and Avis to a franchisee, like a group of McDonald's restaurants.
HFS, which is merging with CUC International, collects its money off the top. In the first half of this year alone, Avis paid HFS $44.7 million in fees, including $37.8 million in royalties. While the actual numbers are hard to gauge because of the way the company has adjusted them, Avis earned only $1.3 million over the last 12 months, although it is expected to earn about $30 million, or $1.05 a share, this year.
Because of the royalty payments, Avis's profit margins are slimmer than those of Hertz or Budget. Because HFS would continue to take its share of sales, the margins could be squeezed even more if profits slumped during a recession or if competition forced Avis to lower its prices.
Avis is also less diversified than its competitors. Hertz, for example, has the nation's largest equipment-rental business, renting earthmovers and trucks to the construction industry.
There are also risks to the rental car market. Like its competitors, Avis carries high levels of debt, much of it from the financing of the cars it buys. The company, which is somewhat more highly leveraged than Hertz, has nearly $3 billion in long-term debt, much of which is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. If rates suddenly climbed, so would Avis's payments on that debt, and its profits would be hurt.
To be sure, there are plenty of reasons to like Avis, and not just because it tries harder.
Avis is certainly cheaper than Hertz, at least based on earnings projections for 1998. Hertz stock, which closed Friday at $34.125, is selling at about 16 times next year's estimated earnings per share. At a proposed $16 a share, Avis would trade at a multiple of just 11. Budget, which is also publicly held, closed Friday at $29.875, giving it a 1998 multiple of 15.
The lower price for Avis may reflect a recognition of investor qualms over the stock, said Jon Baranko, the syndicate manager for the Strong Funds in Milwaukee, who is still evaluating the offering.
But whether the stock is priced low enough to account fully for those qualms is debatable.
The involvement of HFS could also be an advantage, Mr. Baranko said. Historically, Avis has sought out business travelers, who accounted for about 61 percent of its domestic sales last year. Because HFS has an extensive network of hotel franchises, including Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Ramada, as well as links to other consumer businesses, the company may be able to persuade some of its existing customers to use Avis when renting cars.
Moreover, "in good times, you want a more leveraged play," Mr. Ballen said. Because HFS takes its share from sales, he explained, any improvement in Avis's profit margins would have a more marked effect on earnings.
Mr. Donovan of American Express agreed, adding that since Avis's sole business is rental cars, investors wanting to capitalize on the good times in the industry should look toward Avis.
"The risk," he said, "is in the next downturn." And that may be the key to thinking about Avis as an investment. The chance that the car rental business will suffer from a sudden slowdown in the economy or a price war keeps the company's stock a runner-up.

Trade War on the Home Front

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TRADE talks, the Clinton White House has long insisted, are the arms control face-offs of the 90's. Sure, parking American cars in Osaka showrooms doesn't exactly concentrate the mind the way scrapping nukes aimed at Los Angeles once did. But whether the subject is throw-weights or tariff rates, the talks are really about national security and the uses of national power.
And much as it was during the cold war, Washington is caught up in an ideological debate over how its negotiators should use the huge pile of poker chips before them -- terrifying nuclear might then and the world's strongest economy now. 
 But why, at a time of such strength, are Democrats threatening to take away the President's authority to negotiate deals abroad? And does the current domestic-centered debate have much to do with the ultimate goal: striking the toughest trade deals possible with other nations?
 
Ideology vs. Pragmatism

As with previous free-trade debates, the struggle again involves the question of whether ideology or pragmatism should govern American trade policy -- with all concerned, of course, declaring that they are the true pragmatists. Oddly enough, this debate was supposed to be over several years ago. After a brief flirtation with trying to use trade deals to accomplish other goals -- getting better treatment of dissidents in China or workers in sweatshops just south of the Mexican border -- President Clinton discovered that the mix could quickly turn volatile.
The effort to link trade and social change quickly became immersed in politics here, and raised so many cries abroad that Americans were once again using their power to remake the world in Washington's image, that they undermined the main objective: to open markets to American goods. So with the notable execptions of Cuba and Myanmar, formerly Burma, Mr. Clinton has usually kept trade separate from other foreign-policy goals. Now the Administration argues that the 200 trade deals it has cut in the past four years have fueled the huge surge in American exports -- and, slowly but surely, strengthened its influence around the world on non-trade issues.
Perhaps so, but many argue that tallying up all those exports has become an end unto itself -- to the detriment of other national interests. "President Clinton may well be spending more time promoting American sales abroad than doing anything else in foreign affairs," Samuel P. Huntington, the Harvard political scientist, wrote in a critical article in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. "If so, that would be a dramatic sign of the redirection of American foreign policy."
Now Mr. Clinton finds himself caught in the same debate that dogged him when he was first pushing the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress in 1993, a bruising battle that alienated the left wing of the Democratic party and infuriated the nation's unions.
He needs the renewal of what trade wonks call "fast track" authority, which gives him the right to negotiate deals abroad that Congress can approve or defeat -- but not amend, which would continually reopen negotiations. Other countries in the world will not talk to Washington unless Mr. Clinton has that authority.
Mr. Clinton is forcing the issue now because he knows that if he doesn't win the authority before serious mid-term election politicking sets in, he can forget about it. And in the next few years, the United States is going to be thrown into a range of negotiations at the new World Trade Organization, on everything from the rules for opening foreign markets to foreign-provided services, to changing the ways governments tilt the bidding on its contracts (a trillion-dollar market in Asia alone in the next decade), to protecting intellectual property. "These negotiations are going ahead anyway, with us or without us," said Mr. Clinton's tough-talking Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky. "Either we're going to be in the game, setting the rules, or they get set for us. And guess who the loser will be in that case."
The argument focuses on what kind of rules to set. Unions, bolstered by the perceived victory for labor in the recent United Parcel Service strike, say that the only way to truly protect American workers is to make sure laborers in other countries can unionize, and that nations cannot attract investment with lax environmental standards. And if trade agreements can help out industry by bringing in outside issues like protecting copyrights and patents, why not also use them to protect workers?
 
Nafta's Aftertaste
 "To replicate failed trade policies of the past that protect intellectual property rights but do nothing to protect ordinary citizens, to write more rules into agreements to advance corporate interests at the expense of everyone else, is simply unacceptable," John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., told Congress last week.
Mr. Sweeney and Representative Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, argue that Nafta never delivered benefits to American workers and that the "side agreements" on labor rights and the environment, thrown to them as a bone, proved useless.
It is an appealing argument, because clearly trade has a lot to do with the slow growth of wages in the United States. But as a practical matter, it may not be realistic. "Better education and training programs are likely to do more for helping American workers deal with a global marketplace than anything in a trade accord that describes labor standards," said I. M. Deftler, a professor at the University of Maryland who is a leading historian of trade accords.
 
Free Trade, My Way

Naturally everyone involved in this debate swears up and down that they are free traders, and that they have no intention of using these arguments to try to wall off the American economy from global competition. And, naturally, everyone insists that their path is the only way to truly reciprocal trade. Nonetheless, the president of the United Auto Workers told reporters last week that he would oppose any authority to allow Mr. Clinton to negotiate free trade agreements, no matter what the protections. "We can't even enforce labor rights here in this country," said the leader of the 800,000-member union, Stephen P. Yokich.
This is pure agony for Al Gore, the famed defender of Nafta in a televised debate with Ross Perot. Already battered in the campaign finance investigations, the Vice President is desperate not to alienate union supporters. While Mr. Clinton can afford to look presidential, talking about how opening markets is central to American leadership around the world, Mr. Gore and his staff have been looking desperately for political cover, and finding none.
But in typical Washington fashion, the political argument here is entirely focused on what will sell in Congress -- and not on what will sell with America's trading partners. From Latin America (where President Clinton travels next month) to Asia and Europe, there is growing resentment that America is using its economic power to dictate all kinds of policies within other nations' borders.
Any attempt to force changes in labor and environmental standards in return for access to the American market -- the bottom-line American threat -- would raise charges of violations of sovereignty. Of course, it is Congress that complains of just the same thing when the World Trade Organization rules that American gasoline standards or other rules violate international accords.
"The hardest part of this debate is not within the U.S., it's when you actually negotiate an agreement with Asia or Latin America," said Robert Pastor, a professor at Emory University who has worked with Democrats and Republicans to come up with compromise wording that would allow the trade talks to begin. "The fact is that the rest of the world has been waiting a long time for the U.S. to get moving."

HEADLINE: Scold War;
Yelling At the Little Red Menace

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
Testing fourth graders in reading and eighth graders in math, however important, doesn't sound like that incendiary an idea. But the rancorous debate over President Clinton's proposed national test, which was alternately depicted as part of a Federal takeover of education, a pathway toward a dumbed-down curriculum and a sure way to stigmatize and penalize ethnic minorities and the poor, was a vivid reminder of just how impossibly politicized the national educational debate has become.
More than a decade after the landmark "Nation at Risk" report warned that America's lagging schools represented an "act of unthinking unilateral educational disarmament," it is worth asking how the Little Red Schoolhouse came to replace the Evil Empire as the biggest threat to the nation's security, and whether there is any way to slow the rhetorical arms race. 
 The short answer to the first question, coming at a time when Mr. Clinton appears in schools so often that he seems to be running for P.T.A. president, is that the nationalization of educational politics, the increasingly clear link between education levels and economic well-being and a shortage of competing perils have made schooling ground zero for many of the nation's most charged cultural and political issues. If there's a short answer for the second, no one has come up with it yet.
At the least, however, the escalating school wars over issues ranging from curriculum to teacher standards to school prayer are evidence of a fundamental tension certain to persist as efforts to improve national educational performance butt up against the fierce localism and sense of independence that have always characterized American education.
"Schooling is much more like religion than it is like economic policy or public policy," said Stephen Arons, a professor of legal studies at the University of Massachusetts and the author of "Short Route to Chaos: Conscience, Community and the Re-Constitution of American Schooling" (University of Massachusetts Press, 1997). "When you treat schooling as if it were a question strictly of public policy you wind up with the same kinds of problems you would have if you tried to create a state or national religion. This has been an issue since the 1840's, but for various reasons it's an issue now like never before."
The Senate last week approved Mr. Clinton's proposal for the first national test of individual student achievement after an amendment took control from the Education Department and gave it to an independent, bipartisan board. But the House, where opposition has been focused thus far, seems likely to approve a proposal next week that would bar Federal funds for the test, which is bitterly opposed by Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
As Mr. Arons notes, educational politics did not begin with the current culture wars. Horace Mann and the other crusaders for mass public education in the 1840's said the nation's future depended on better schools that would instill both learning and moral values. Numerous education reform eras were to follow, some of which, like the Sputnik scare of the late 1950's, made education an issue of national security.
Still, the current moment is extraordinary, education experts say. While education is always a potentially volatile subject, the public animus toward schools and educators that is now taken almost for granted is relatively new. When the Gallup Poll asked for criticisms of the schools in 1946, 40 percent of respondents could not come up with anything to complain about.
Many things have changed since then.
The increasing education presence in Washington, which has grown enormously through the Clinton Administration's Goals 2000 program to determine national standards, has brought armies of Congressional staffs, public relations experts and advocates of all stripes campaigning for maximum political advantage. On that national grid at least four major forces -- businesses clamoring for national standards, the institutionalized web of education organizations that conservatives call "the Blob," religious conservatives and advocates for minorities and the poor -- find themselves pitted against each other in shifting alliances.
With peace and prosperity and no looming foreign enemy, education is an inviting area for politicians looking for a legacy and a lightning rod for stray political energies crackling across the landscape. When that 1946 Gallup Poll was taken, for example, a national test, if anyone thought to give one, would have been given only in English. Many people now say that to do so would penalize students who read well but whose first language is not English. Many others say national tests in any language other than English would be an outrage.
"We don't have the enemy outside, but we do have all this anxiety, all this anger within about who we are, what's our history, what are our values," said Mike Rose, an education professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "So, bingo, where do they play out but in the schoolroom?" Educational issues have been transformed from diffuse, fractured, largely manageable ones that play out in local districts and individual schools to large, political, often symbolic ones.
Mr. Arons, who sees himself as a libertarian, says the key to bringing down the level of discord is divorcing schooling as much as possible not just from the national government but from local politics as well.
But the schisms may be so broad that that won't help much. Conservatives like Lynne Cheney, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a critic of curriculum changes toward what some call "whole math" or "fuzzy math," say it's the content more than the theory of schooling that's at issue. "I don't think schools 30 years ago were doing anything so faddish and dismaying as what they're doing now," she said.
Still, as contentious as the debates are, many liberal critics say the most important issue in education -- the huge gap in resources available to the wealthiest schools and the poorest ones -- is not being discussed at all. That suggests that as contentious as the school wars are, there is plenty of room left for them to get worse.

HEADLINE: The World;
In Death, Too, Demand for Diana Exceeds the Supply

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN an emotional news conference at a celebrity tennis tournament in Florida last week, the pop star Elton John urged people still mourning the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, to begin putting aside their grief and get on with their lives.
Even still, they might like to buy the new version of Mr. John's song "Candle In the Wind," which he performed to great effect at Diana's funeral and which is expected to be the biggest-selling single of all time. (Proceeds, Mr. John pledged, are to go to the Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, which is becoming the fastest-growing memorial fund of all time.) 
 Nobody doubts that Mr. John, a friend of the princess, is deeply upset by her violent and untimely death on Aug. 31. Even so, he has found himself, however altruistically, squarely placed on what has quickly turned into a speeding Diana bandwagon.
Are people profiting from the princess's death? The flower industry, to name one group, seemed to do extraordinarily well in the last two weeks, when mourners blanketed the entrances of the capital's royal palaces with as many as 60 million flowers, one for every resident of Britain.
"If you think about it, one of the cornerstones of the florestry profession is doing funeral work and dealing with people who are bereaved," said Andrea Caldecourt, a spokeswoman for the Flowers and Plants Association, a British industry group. "People want to express their regret that she had died, and flowers are an obvious way of doing that."
While some segments of the floral industry clearly benefited -- Holland, where 87 percent of Britain's imported flowers come from, saw a 20 to 25 percent rise in volume -- others actually suffered. "Due to the funeral, a huge number of large engagements, like weddings and balls and functions, were canceled, and the flowers were canceled, too," said Anthony Mcalister, chairman of the Flower Import Trade Association here.
Some news outlets around the world have enjoyed unexpected benefits from the princess's death. For MSNBC, the 14-month-old cable channel, the tragedy might prove to be as big a bonanza as the Gulf war was to CNN. While the channel generally draws an audience well below 100,000, at times in the last two weeks its audience reached a million people, said Julia Moffett, a spokeswoman for NBC News in New York.
 
Ready to Serve
 "We don't want to make it appear that success was riding on the back of tragedy, but this was an event in which people were hungry for news and information over a sustained period of time," she said. "MSNBC got to prove itself. Our long-term goal is to be a viable competitor of CNN, and this proved that we are certainly poised to do that."
Although they were regularly cast as the villains in the tragedy, Britain's London-based national newspapers reaped huge circulation benefits from Diana's death, with readers sometimes lining up in the street outside newspaper stores to buy copies. Although final figures aren't available, all the papers had hugely increased sales, particularly on the Sunday that Diana died and on the following Sunday, the day after her funeral, when many newspapers released what they called "commemorative" editions. Often, sales rose by several hundred thousand copies.
For some time, it seems, the world will not be able to get away from Diana -- whether it wants to or not. In the last two weeks, her photograph has appeared on the covers of magazines from Time and the Economist to Vanity Fair and Hello!, the glossy celebrity publication whose title reflects its institutional enthusiasm. (The week after her death, Hello! sold about a million copies, or double its usual volume this time of year). A number of publications have pulled together special all-Diana issues (portions of the proceeds, inevitably, will go to Diana's charity).
Next come the books. Not one, not two, not three, but books into the double digits are being re-released, hastily assembled or brought out sooner than expected in the wake of Diana's death. St. Martin's Press is reprinting 200,000 copies of "Diana: Her Life in Photographs," a 1995 picture book that has been updated and renamed "Diana: A Tribute in Photographs," and which will arrive in stores in November. At Simon & Schuster, Diana books being re-issued at well past the million-copy mark in total include paperbacks about Diana, Prince William, Diana and astrology, and the British royal family.
 
Not a Penny
 In hard cover, the publisher is re-issuing "Diana: Her True Story" in early October with a fat new color photo section and a new introduction by the author, Andrew Morton. According to a spokesman, Simon & Schuster has already received 525,000 advance orders for the book.
John Murphy, a spokesman for St. Martin's Press, said St. Martin's wasn't trying to profit from the princess's death. "The advance orders we got were enormous," he said, "and a portion of the proceeds are going to Diana's foundation."
Bantam Doubleday Dell is bringing out "Diana: A Tribute," a two-hour audio book that is currently being assembled by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman, said the company wanted to release something "fresh and authoritative."
"There's been a frenzied consumer response, and of course we wouldn't have this commercial opportunity if it wasn't for the tragedy," Mr. Applebaum added. "So we're going to give a portion of the profits from the sale of the audio to the Princess of Wales memorial fund."
What else? The restaurants along Kensington High Street, just below the princess's apartment in Kensington Palace, are continuing to enjoy increased traffic from visitors making pilgrimages to what is fast becoming a shrine to Diana. In Paris, newspapers have reported that some tourist groups are being led to the spot in the tunnel where she met her death.
And, in what has at times felt like mass hysteria, no suggestion has been too far-reaching. Some have proposed renaming Heathrow Airport after the princess. Others would like to see the Mall, the wide road that connects Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace, closed forever to traffic and an enormous statue of Diana erected atop Trafalgar Square's empty marble column.
Even the ultra-respectable BBC has gotten in on the action. In addition to its audio tape, it is releasing a Diana video that will be "an uplifting rather than a sad tribute to the Princess of Wales," said Vicky Thomas, a spokeswoman for BBC Consumer Publishing. "All the money we make out of this is going to the Princess of Wales's memorial fund," she said. "We're not making a penny out of this."

HEADLINE: Albright Asks Arab States To Attend Summit Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Sept. 13

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said today that he was hopeful the situation in the Middle East would improve enough for American-sponsored regional economic summit talks to go on as planned in Qatar in mid-November.
With important Arab countries planning to boycott the meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today at a news conference with Mr. Mubarak that the meeting "is important in itself" and should not be made conditional on the status of the peace talks with Israel. 
 One of Ms. Albright's aims in her first official visit to the Middle East has been to show enough movement in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship to salvage the annual regional meeting, which is only in its fourth year. American officials say that a deteriorating peace effort hurts larger American strategic interests in the rest of the Middle East, and contributes to the fraying of the coalition Washington built after the Persian Gulf war to contain both Iraq and Iran.
Egyptian and American officials said that they had discussed the possibility of postponing the conference, but that they believe there is enough time to show progress between Israel and the Palestinians and even Israel and Syria to salvage the meeting.
The meeting symbolizes the American vision of a peaceful, cooperative Middle East concentrating on trade and mutual economic benefits rather than on recriminations, injustices and suicide bombers.
The Syrians have already said that they will not attend the meeting, though it is not known whether Ms. Albright was able to change President Hafez el-Assad's mind when they met Friday night for three hours in Damascus.
Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has already told the United States that "under current conditions" the Saudis cannot attend the meeting, which is to be held in Doha, Qatar. If the Saudis do not attend, many of the smaller Persian Gulf countries may also boycott the meeting.
Ms. Albright is scheduled to meet Prince Abdullah late tonight in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and officials of the gulf nations on Sunday.
American officials are concerned about the implications of a boycott, especially since most of the same countries are sure to attend an Islamic conference in Iran that opens on Dec. 9.
Mr. Mubarak, a firm American ally, praised Ms. Albright for her efforts to give a new impetus to the Israel-Palestinian peace effort and stop its deterioration. He called her statements "encouraging and balanced," and said they give hope "for the peace process to go forward."
He cited her ability to arrange new meetings in Washington and then at the United Nations later this month between Israeli and Palestinian officials, for which she will be host, and a similar meeting at the United Nations between the Israeli and Syrian Foreign Ministers.
Ms. Albright herself called these new meetings "small steps" and termed them disappointing when the region required Israeli and Palestinian leaders to take "big steps" and make "hard decisions" for peace.
"I hope there is progress so the Doha conference can convene," Mr. Mubarak said today. "If there is progress in the peace process, it would help for the conference to be held on a higher level." His implication was that Egypt would not boycott the conference if it was held in any case, but he might send low-ranking officials.
"I hope the situation can be improved," Mr. Mubarak said. "We still have some time, and we are trying hard on this. We are waiting -- we are hoping."
Egyptian officials said that if peace talks were going on at some level, it would provide Cairo enough cover to come to Qatar.
For her part, Ms. Albright argued that the meeting is "important in itself." She said: "It is in the interests of the region to be part of the global economy. Doha is not a favor to anyone in particular. It's a favor to the people of the region, who can gain."

HEADLINE: As Taste for Comfort Rises, So Do Corporations' Profits

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Ellen Elias has not yet seen the latest General Electric refrigerator, featuring a filter that purifies the chipped ice and chilled drinking water that at the touch of a button flows from a spigot on the door. But she already knows the sales pitch she will use to get shoppers who visit her Manhattan appliance store to buy the $1,800 refrigerator -- about twice the price of a standard one.
"I'll go right to my bottled-water question," she said, "and if they tell me they drink it, I'm off. I'll point out they no longer have to lug home bottles from the supermarket. And if they counter that the bottled water is delivered to their doors, then I'll point out that they will no longer have to waste valuable space in crowded apartments on storage." 
 More than ever in recent years, American companies are pushing the sale of higher-priced, higher-profit merchandise. Responding to the income inequality that increasingly divides the population, they are successfully aiming at the growing percentage of households with annual incomes of $75,000 or more.
And they do so for a practical reason. In this era of too much merchandise competing for buyers, companies say they cannot raise prices for standard products. So they are adding some gadget or twist that millions of consumers are willing, or can be persuaded, to pay extra to have -- usually on the ground that it is useful or practical and not just luxurious. In each of these higher prices, an extra profit is embedded.
The process is called product differentiation, which is hardly new in America. But more than in the past, marketers are addressing one segment of the population: households on the upper end of the income spectrum, those earning $50,000 or more, and particularly those earning above $75,000. Their incomes, adjusted for inflation, have risen while those below them have not.
This upper group also tends, more than others, to invest in the stock market. And after 6 years of economic recovery and 15 years of rising stock prices, polls show them to be unusually confident that their good fortune will continue.
"They feel they have done well after surviving the worst of times -- recession, downsizing, the 1987 stock market crash -- and they want to reward and indulge themselves," said Madelyn Hochstein, president of DYG Inc., a public opinion polling firm in Danbury, Conn., that does surveys mostly for corporations. "They are sensitive to quality and utility, and to being able to buy what others can't afford. What they buy has to be the best and differentiate them."
Corporate America has noticed and responded. General Electric, which did not introduce its profile series of high-end refrigerators until 1992, has lately upgraded this already expensive line ($1,400 in 1992) every year, with each new version adding $150 or more to the price, bolstering profit in the process. The latest model has the water filter.
Sport utility vehicles have become a classic, high-profile example of this dynamic. The Ford Motor Company, for example, is doubling the production of the Ford Expedition -- price tag $31,000, well equipped -- while discontinuing four lower-priced cars aimed at the less affluent.
"Most of our profit comes from less than half of the vehicles we sell," said Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, referring to the Expedition and other higher-priced vehicles. Still, great effort goes into the low end. "We grow a lot of customers through our product lines," he said. "They start with Escorts and move on to some other vehicle."
But the upscale phenomenon seems ubiquitous, showing up, for example, in the special features on digital cellular phones, each with a monthly charge, or in new lines of elegant kitchenware, or in the recent splurge in the construction of larger, more expensive homes, or in television sets with ever larger -- and more profitable -- screens, or in Jacuzzi foot-baths, or in electric toothbrushes that, for an extra $20, include a timer that runs the brush for two minutes and then turns it off. Two minutes is the amount of brushing often prescribed by dentists.
"We introduced just this year our Laureate line of homes," said Robert J. Strudler, chairman of the U.S. Home Corporation, describing a 4,000-square-foot, five-bedroom house that at $300,000 or more costs twice as much as the average home that his company builds.
"We are putting 60 of these in Denver alone now," he said. "They have marble tiles in the foyer and halls, cherry wood cabinets, Jacuzzis in the bathrooms, granite kitchen counter tops."
Airlines now get more than 22 percent of their domestic passenger revenue from the sale of first- and business-class seats, up from 9.5 percent in 1987, the Air Transport Association says. "More people are using frequent-flier miles to upgrade," said Christopher Chiames, an American Airlines spokesman, "and when they get up there, they like it, and they want to do it again. And they are willing to pay for it."
That can be considerable. Although airlines offer various fares, the standard ticket on American Airlines for a round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles, for instance, costs $2,830 for a first-class seat, $2,582 for business class and $1,836 for a full coach fare.
Even those who make low-priced goods for the less affluent are tapping into the trend, counting on the easier spending of the affluent to rub off on lower-income households. Rubbermaid, for example, recently added an $18 water filter -- one that filters water poured into a pitcher -- to its line of plastic housewares.
"It is aimed at consumers who will spend a bit more to get value, which is in contrast to the early 90's, when consumers only wanted to spend less," said William Pfund, a Rubbermaid vice president.
The rapid proliferation of high-end products has become a problem for Consumer Reports, which tests merchandise and judges their quality for its many higher-income readers. The testing process takes time, and the publication seeks to judge products that will still be in stores months later, when it publishes its findings.
"We found that we could not test cross-training sneakers fast enough to say anything about models that would still be on the market when we published," said Leslie Ware, a senior editor, referring to a type of shoe designed for different activities.
As upscale marketing spreads, critics warn of its consequences. A falling stock market, for example, could seriously curtail consumption. "The stock market wealth factor on upscale purchasing is huge," said James Smith, an economist for the Rand Corporation, the research group in California.
Others argue that the growing disparity in income, exacerbated by the upscale marketing, adds to social tensions. And in a variation on the wide-ranging debate about how to use the nation's wealth -- either in consumption or investment -- there are those who wonder whether the money should be channeled into spending for the public good rather than into upscale purchases.
"It is fun to get the new toys, but when everyone in your circle gets them, it is no longer so special," said Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell University's Johnson School of Management. "It is money that could have been saved, or used to fix the potholes in the streets, or to build more schools and bridges and highways."
Product differentiation had a different character before the era of wider income inequality. Blue-collar workers moved up from Chevrolets to Pontiacs, for example, while middle-level administrators made the jump from Pontiacs to Oldsmobiles, and upper-echelon executives from Olds to Cadillac. "You were spending your money to show that you had made progress," said Ms. Hochstein of the DYG polling firm.
Self-indulgence characterized the 1960's and 70's. The affluence came to mean that almost everyone could have the good things, and product differentiation, aimed across the board, responded to this outlook. "You spent your money on the wonderful experiences you wanted to have," Ms. Hochstein said.
That began to change in the 80's, when the widening income gulf started to affect the marketplace. The effect has mushroomed in the last two or three years. "What happened was that confidence began to grow," Ms. Hochstein said, "and consumers at the upper-income end began to decide that even if they were downsized, even if the stock market went south again, they could handle it."
Their financial success -- and marketplace importance -- is evident in Labor Department and Census Bureau data. Adjusting for inflation, the percentage of American households with annual incomes of $75,000 or more rose to 18.6 percent in 1995, the latest year for which data are available, from 13 percent in 1982. About 39 percent of all households have incomes of $50,000 or more, up from 32.8 percent in 1982. And the upper 40 percent of households account for 60 percent of the nation's consumer spending.
"Manufacturers have to cover all price points, but the innovation and excitement are skewed to the upper clientele," said Ms. Elias, whose family owns the Elgot appliance store, at 937 Lexington Avenue, near East 68th Street. Ms. Elias, in her mid-40's, is herself a member of this upper-end clientele, having bought at her own store -- with a discount, of course -- a dishwasher for $1,500, more than double the price of the replacement model of the machine she threw out.
"The dishwasher," she said, "is clearly quieter and with 40 percent more capacity than the old one. I am not distracted by noise, and after a party, I can do all the dishes at once."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE CANDIDATE;
For the Ultimate Outsider, the Moment Is Now

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER with LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
He is a minister without a congregation, a politician without a media consultant. He wants to raise New York City's commuter tax, but he owes tens of thousands of dollars in state and Federal taxes. He has long been an anti-establishment street demonstrator, yet he craves political legitimacy.
A man of relentless contradictions, the Rev. Al Sharpton has demonstrated many times over the years that there are only a few constants in his life: his family, his religion, his commitment to civil rights and his desire for attention. Last week, as perhaps never before in his turbulent public career, Mr. Sharpton reached center stage. 
 In capturing 32 percent of the vote in Tuesday's Democratic mayoral primary and helping to force a runoff against the front-runner, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, Mr. Sharpton served notice that he is a force to be reckoned with in New York politics.
But serious doubt remains about whether he can broaden his base, evolving from a protest candidate to a mainstream politician who can win the runoff and go on to defeat the popular incumbent, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
For now, Mr. Sharpton is reveling in the spotlight, pivoting from housing projects to television studios, switching easily from I-told-them-so triumph to introspection. A short man with a tall man's gait, he took a half-mile victory walk on Wednesday through Bedford-Stuyvesant, where people flocked from their homes to greet him.
It is no accident, he would be the first to agree, that the campaign song he listens to in his purple campaign van is "I Believe I Can Fly," by the hip-hop artist R. Kelly.
"We really did something that they didn't expect," he said during a post-primary interview. "No matter what happens from here out, we have clearly established a permanent presence in the politics of this city. Anyone running for office will have to deal with the strength that I've demonstrated."
Mr. Sharpton has spent much of his 42 years defying expectations -- and, sometimes, common sense. He began preaching in Baptist churches when he was 4. When still in his 20's, he was creating civil-rights organizations while dabbling in the record business. He has repeatedly led marches protesting racial injustices, in one instance helping to force Mario M. Cuomo, then Governor, to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case of a young black man who was killed in Howard Beach, Queens.
But Mr. Sharpton has also associated with figures in organized crime -- he denied knowing they were mobsters -- and with organizations that have been accused of operating like cults, including the New Alliance Party and the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
He has been a secret government informer, according to Federal authorities, and he has been indicted for fraud and tax offenses, but was acquitted of the charges. He once pleaded guilty to failing to file income taxes and paid a fine, and he is negotiating with state and Federal tax officials over tens of thousands of dollars in back taxes.
He has grabbed headlines and television coverage with provocative oratory, hard-edged street theater and charges that many find indefensible. Mr. Sharpton insists he has matured and, even if he has made some mistakes, critics should look at him in a broader light. "I come with a level of controversy," he said. "Some would say, baggage. I say all politicians have baggage. It's just that some politicians get skycaps to carry their baggage. I have to carry my own."
He contends that detractors who become fixated on a remark that he might have made years ago are ignoring, perhaps willfully, the many ways in which he has changed. "I think some people get locked into a time period of your career because they want to," he said.
 
Seeking Mainstream And Facing Skeptics
Over the last few years, Mr. Sharpton has tried to move, in fits and starts, from agitator to statesman. He ran twice in Democratic primaries for the United States Senate, in 1992 and 1994, and he won points for his restraint and sense of humor.
He has been dogged, though, by some enduring questions: Can he remain a defiant voice of the poor and disenfranchised while also moving toward the political mainstream? Is his support limited, enabling him in the end only to make a strong but symbolic showing in Democratic primaries? Or can he fashion a broader coalition that could actually make him a Democratic nominee?
Mr. Sharpton said last week's primary showed once and for all that he was a serious political candidate.
But many elected officials and political consultants remain skeptical. They say he still has not shown that he can win broad support from Hispanic New Yorkers and make significant inroads among white voters who have long regarded him with deep suspicion.
Two days ago, the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said he would not support Mr. Sharpton, citing his "willingness to tolerate the bigotry" of Louis Farrakhan and Leonard Jeffries, a City College professor who made racist and anti-Semitic remarks.
Another senior Democratic elected official called Mr. Sharpton "a protest candidate" with a limited constituency. "I don't know if there's anything he can do to broaden his support," the official said. "He's pretty well defined with respect to the New York voter. They know who he is. Those who like who he is vote for him no matter what. Those who don't will never vote for him. He can't be anything else. He is what he is."
The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying -- as did many Democrats interviewed for this article -- that he did not want to risk antagonizing Mr. Sharpton or his supporters.
The runoff on Sept. 23 presents Mr. Sharpton with his best opportunity yet to show whether he can expand his political base, many politicians say. It will not be easy, as the primary results on Tuesday demonstrated. He attracted about the same number of city votes that he did in two previous primaries, and benefited mightily from Ms. Messinger's poor showing.
He nonetheless pulled off the unexpected -- which is hardly out of character for Mr. Sharpton. Few people have had a higher profile in New York's public life over the last 15 years. Virtually every New Yorker knows who he is, and few people are noncommital. He is, in many ways, a prism through which vast segments of New York's diverse racial and economic mix view themselves and their city.
To supporters, he is a committed civil-rights activist, following proudly in the tradition of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He has led dozens of protest marches, demonstrating against everything from minor cases of police misconduct to the racial killings of young black men in Howard Beach, Queens, and Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
He was stabbed in the chest by a drunken white man during a march in Bensonhurst in 1991. He led several hundred people who sat down on subway tracks in downtown Brooklyn in 1987, blocking rush-hour trains on eight lines during a protest over the death of Michael Griffith, who was struck by a car after being chased by a gang of whites onto a highway in Howard Beach.
But to detractors, Mr. Sharpton is an irresponsible opportunist, who has repeatedly fanned the flames of racial discord by inserting himself into charged situations. Critics point to his role in the case of Tawana Brawley, a black high school student from Wappingers Falls, N.Y., who contended in 1987 that she had been abducted and raped over four days by six racist white men.
After a prolonged inquiry, during which Mr. Sharpton and other family advisers successfully urged the young girl and her mother not to cooperate with investigators, a grand jury concluded that the entire affair had been a hoax -- concocted by Ms. Brawley, apparently to avoid a beating from her stepfather for having been away from home for four days. Mr. Sharpton still contends that she was assaulted.
 
Clashing Images And a Quieter Candidate
Critics point to a number of other incidents that, in their view, show that Mr. Sharpton continues to work outside acceptable public discourse.
Just two years ago, for example, during a rally protesting expansion plans by a clothing store on 125th Street, Mr. Sharpton described the owner of the store as a "white interloper" and insisted that "we are not turning 125th Street back over to outsiders." Three months later, eight people died in a fire at the store set by a gunman, after an intense, racially charged campaign to prevent the store's expansion.
Proponents see in Mr. Sharpton a man unafraid to speak his mind, to represent the interests of the poor and powerless more aggressively than more established political and church officials. But detractors view him as a racial incendiary, someone willing to say and do outrageous things, if only they will keep him in front of the television cameras.
For much of this decade, Mr. Sharpton has certainly tried to moderate his image. He has lost weight, trimmed his hair and no longer wears jogging suits with a large medallion with a likeness of Dr. King around his neck. Since he first began running for elective office, in the 1992 Democratic Senate primary, he has generally appeared in public in dark suits and ties.
His conduct and language as a candidate have been, relatively speaking, subdued -- though still lively. He insists that he has changed, in part because of some soul-searching after he was stabbed six years ago. He also credits his family. He and his wife, Kathy Jordan-Sharpton -- a gospel singer and former back-up singer for James Brown -- have been married for 16 years. They have two daughters -- Dominique, 11, and Ashley, 10 -- who attend a private school in Brooklyn. After living in Brooklyn and then moving to suburban New Jersey, the family returned recently to Flatbush.
"I think that I have matured, and I think that I've tried to grow," he said. "I don't think that I've changed in terms of basics. I think I've changed in terms of style and in terms of what I'm trying to project. In the 80's, I was far more concerned about getting my issues straight in the newspapers. In the 90's, I'm far more concerned about getting our message straight in history."
Mr. Sharpton and his allies believe he has already begun to expand his political base. He contended that middle-class black voters had supported him on Tuesday, and that they had not always done so. He also said he had earned some support from Hispanic New Yorkers and liberal whites. "I could not have won Brooklyn by 11 points with just black votes," Mr. Sharpton said.
Gregory W. Meeks, a Democratic State Assemblyman from Queens, said that by emphasizing issues like police misconduct and unemployment, Mr. Sharpton could cross the city's racial and economic lines. "When you talk about economic development throughout the city -- that will reverberate to help expand his base," he said.
And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has long been a friend and adviser to Mr. Sharpton and who campaigned with him yesterday in Harlem, said he had been expanding his vote total by registering new voters. "People who would not have voted at all have found in him some hope," Mr. Jackson said.
But many politicians are skeptical that Mr. Sharpton can attract large numbers of new supporters. They say that his total on Tuesday -- 126,782 votes -- is not significantly different from his totals in the city when he ran in the 1992 and 1994 Democratic Senate primaries.
Mr. Sharpton is evidently aware that some of his more provocative remarks have hurt his chances of appealing to more white voters. On Tuesday night, he acknowledged vaguely that he had made some mistakes. Asked about that remark later, he cited his reference to the Harlem store owner two years ago as a "white interloper." He apologized, saying he had been wrong to have referred to the man's race, but defending his characterization of him as an outsider.
There was also publicity recently about a libel suit against Mr. Sharpton, connected to the Brawley case. In that case, scheduled to go on trial in November, a former Dutchess County assistant district attorney has sued Mr. Sharpton for slander, for having accused him in 1988 of participating in Ms. Brawley's abduction and rape. The former prosecutor, Stephen A. Pagones, was cleared by the grand jury.
Incidents like these may limit Mr. Sharpton's chance of winning broader acceptance. "To be able to do that, he has to be able to communicate with people who are very skeptical, who think he is very radical," said Mel Miller, the former State Assembly Speaker from Brooklyn who is now a lobbyist. "There's a lot of baggage here."
Ms. Messinger could readily defeat Mr. Sharpton in the runoff next week if a significant portion of Democrats who voted for the primary's third-place finisher, City Councilman Sal Albanese of Brooklyn, were to switch to Ms. Messinger.
But it is also possible, some political analysts theorize, that Mr. Sharpton could pull off an upset victory without finding new sources of support. If the turnout among his core supporters increases somewhat, and Ms. Messinger continues to have difficulty energizing her natural supporters, the contest could be tight.
Mr. Sharpton, ever upbeat, said that even if he remained locked into his total from the primary -- almost 127,000 votes -- he still would have a reasonable chance in the runoff. "If only 200,000 come out in a runoff, the other side has a problem," he said.
"I think that they're going to be surprised, again."

RUTH W. MESSINGER
 
At a backyard fund-raising event on Staten Island:
"So let me just tell you, I need your help as voters and civic leaders, not only to vote yourselves on Sept. 23d and Nov. 4th -- I hope I have convinced you to do that -- but to tell lots of other people to vote, to talk to a member of my staff, to put up a flier in your place of business, and remind people when the elections are. That's a civic responsibility; that's not partisan campaigning. I want you to wear these buttons for the next six weeks and tell people who to vote for. And the other thing that I need to do is to keep raising money. I am very proud of the fact that I have a campaign that has received 17,000 donations. The average contribution to my campaign is $200. That means that I am, in fact, beholden to the people who are working with me, the people who are supporting me, and I am not beholden to special interests." 

AL SHARPTON
 
At a press conference at his headquarters in Harlem yesterday afternoon:
"Mr. Giuliani has governed for four years. We have record unemployment. We have schools that have not effectively educated our children. We have school buildings in disrepair. So I think that so-called new mood that he set four years ago has been a failure. We wouldn't be having a primary if we didn't have different traditions and different styles. Clearly there are differences in the Democratic Party but it's big enough to have those differences and unite behind a winner."

HEADLINE: Judge Has His Own Take On Sentencing Formulas

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
It was one day last spring that Solomon Halberstam, the Grand Rabbi of the Bobov Hasidim, made an emotional appeal to a Federal judge in Manhattan on behalf of an Orthodox Jew about to be sentenced in an insurance fraud case.
Rabbi Halberstam asked Judge Lewis A. Kaplan not to impose a severe penalty on Solomon Sprei because fathers in the Bobov community, like Mr. Sprei, were responsible for finding their children's marriage partners. If Mr. Sprei was imprisoned for too long, "his children of marriageable age will not be able to find spouses for themselves," Rabbi Halberstam said. "They will be as 'living orphans.' Heaven forbid." 
 Under the rigid rules that dictate sentencing in the Federal district courts, Mr. Sprei was supposed to receive three to four years in prison. But Judge Kaplan said he was persuaded, by the rabbi's letter, that "a lengthy term of imprisonment would have dramatic adverse consequences for at least two and probably three of the children." Also citing Mr. Sprei's generous deeds in the community, he sentenced him to only 18 months and ordered him to pay $1.8 million in restitution.
The case, which was appealed by the Government and is pending before the Federal appeals court in Manhattan, has spawned an intense legal and philosophical debate that pits an 89-year-old rabbi and his community's ancient customs against the court's own arcane practice of slotting defendants into formulas and charts to determine appropriate punishments.
The rules, from which a judge can deviate only in extreme cases, were devised in the 1980's to make Federal sentencing more consistent and to take into account a defendant's record and the seriousness of a crime. In this case, the Government contends that the disruption of family life is inherent in the punishment of criminal behavior. It argues in its appeal that Judge Kaplan improperly cited religious factors that could open the door to "whole classes of people" making similar demands -- a view echoed by legal experts.
"I am very surprised that a judge really bought the argument, because once you begin taking these things into consideration then everybody can come in," said J. David Bleich, professor of law and ethics at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York.
But other experts said the case symbolized the struggle of judges who believe they have been stripped of their discretion by the sentencing formulas.
"I'd have a lot of sympathy for a conscientious Federal judge who did not consider himself bound by them and wanted to substitute his or her own reasoned judgment about what punishment fits what crime," said Michael J. Sandel, a government professor at Harvard University who teaches the popular course called Justice.
Indeed, Judge Kaplan deviated from the sentencing guidelines in one previous case and has said that he would in another. In both cases, he wanted more severe penalties because he felt the formulas did not reflect the seriousness of the crimes.
Court records describe Mr. Sprei, 42, as an unemployed father of six, who was educated at Yeshivas and had no higher education. His family resides in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn with the other Bobov Hasidim, who trace their roots back to the Polish town of Bobov.
In January 1996, prosecutors charged him with 21 counts in a fraud scheme that resulted in losses to insurance companies of about $17 million. Last October, he agreed to plead guilty to two counts, and his defense lawyer and the prosecutor agreed to seek a sentence, as computed under the guidelines, of roughly three to four years.
But on March 13, one day before the sentencing, a lawyer, Andrew J. Levander, claiming to represent Rabbi Halberstam "and the worldwide Bobov Community that Rabbi Halberstam leads," sent the judge Rabbi Halberstam's letter and letters from 36 other family members and friends in the Bobov sect.
They pleaded with the judge to allow Mr. Sprei to avoid a prison sentence, citing his charity to others, his ailing father, and the impact on his children.
"You probably are not familiar with the marriage practices in our community," Mr. Sprei's wife, Sara, wrote.
She described their 18-year-old son's predicament: he was ready for marriage but was suffering from the stigma of his father's arrest. If the judge incarcerated Mr. Sprei, she said, "it will destroy my son's chances for a decent match."
In court the next day, a Government prosecutor, George S. Canellos, said Mr. Sprei's sentence "should reflect the absolute massiveness" of the fraud, according to a court transcript.
But Judge Kaplan said he was concerned that the Government commission that wrote the sentencing rules had not foreseen such a case. "I am persuaded," he said, "that to incarcerate Mr. Sprei for a lengthy period would wreak extraordinary destruction of a kind that never dawned on the Sentencing Commission on a number of these children."
The judge also cited Mr. Sprei's selfless contributions to his community, as laid out in the letters that he said he had read and found "quite moving."
Mr. Sprei apologized for his crime and asked the judge "to find in your heart some way to allow me to stay with my family."
Judge Kaplan said the fraud was too great to allow Mr. Sprei to walk out of court a free man, but he said, "the period of incarceration ought to be related to the ages of the children, whose interests play such an important role in my thinking."
In deciding on a sentence of 18 months, he said he realized that the 18-year-old son would still be adversely affected but perhaps his other children would benefit.
"I selected 18 months with a view to the fact that the next oldest child is 16," the judge explained, "and it is my hope to avoid a serious adverse impact with the respect to the next child."
Mr. Sprei, who is currently serving his prison sentence, could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Bosnians Vote, But Animosity Is Unrelenting

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Escorted by NATO troops in armored vehicles, buses lurched and rolled out of Sarajevo early this morning. They were taking Bosnian Muslims for a few emotional moments to villages in which they had lived before the war, where they cast ballots and were then hustled hastily away.
In municipal elections today seen as a vital part of the Dayton peace accord, people across Bosnia voted in their prewar towns, many returning for the first time to places they had been expelled from in the bitter conflict among Muslims, Serbs and Croats. 
 In towns like Srebrenica, where several thousand Muslim men were massacred in the summer of 1995 by Bosnian Serb troops, Muslim officials will probably be elected to office, although no Muslims currently live in the area.
And in Drvar, Glamoc and Bosansko Grahovo, near Bosnia's western border with Croatia, representatives of the prewar Serbian majority were also set to be elected to power, although most of the Serbs have been expelled.
Communities that do not accept the election results, which are not expected before Sept. 20, will have sanctions imposed on them, international officials say. But the elections, which were postponed twice, appeared unlikely to alter Bosnia's partition into three antagonistic enclaves or release the grip on power by nationalist hard-liners.
Critics of the vote said sanctions would probably not be enough to force nationalist leaders to abide by the results, especially since many have amassed great wealth in their positions.
The Dayton peace agreement, those critics said, rather than fostering a process to move Bosnia toward democratic rule and a multi-ethnic society, has resulted in a series of NATO-managed events that have so far failed to alter the dismal political landscape.
"What we will most likely end up with are a number of governments-in-exile," said a Western diplomat. "These elected officials will not even be able to visit the towns they are supposed to administer. Power will remain in the hands of those who have always had little regard for the peace agreement or the democratic process."
The 34,000-member NATO-led peacekeeping force sent out heavily armed patrols today, stationed troops in armored personnel carriers at polling places and crossroads and had helicopters buzzing over much of the country. Buses crossing the partition lines between the Bosnian Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation were stopped by NATO troops and passengers were taken off the vehicles and searched for weapons.
Ibro Obhodzas, 56, stood in line at a polling place outside of Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, that had been set up for former Muslim residents. It was the first time since 1992, when he was evicted from his house, that he had been back. Mr. Obhodzas, a former factory worker who spent the war with his wife and two daughters in Germany, returned to Bosnia a few months ago; his family remains in Germany and sends him the money to survive in Sarajevo.
"I feel more like a refugee in my own country than I do in Germany," he said. "The people who have power do not care how we vote. We cannot build the old Bosnia, the Bosnia where people tried to live together, until these nationalist leaders are gone. And that may take years. I just wanted to stand for a few minutes on the soil where I was born."
The deep divide among the three ethnic communities was in evidence today as they wrangled over the voting.
The Bosnian Croats refused, for example, to permit polls to open in the center of Zepce and Tesanj, which once had Muslim majorities. In Sarajevo, where the majority Muslim population hopes to see a common administration for Bosnia, a powerful bomb Friday night blew the front off the Croatian party headquarters. And in Mostar, Muslims at first boycotted the vote after international officials agreed with the Croats not to hold voting in the important central district of the divided city. A Muslim official was reported to have said later that they had worked out an arrangement with the Croats and would take part.
The Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats, who are supposed to be part of a Muslim-Croat Federation, threatened until late Friday night to boycott the elections.
As in the national elections a year ago, voting today and Sunday was expected to go along ethnic lines.
The Muslim-led Party for Democratic Action, the Croatian Democratic Union and the Serbian Democratic Party have dominated political life in Bosnia since the war started five years ago. All base their appeal on ethnic loyalty rather than any defined political platforms.
Serbs interviewed today reiterated their vows that Muslims would never return home, even if they were elected to run town halls in the Serbian enclave.
Many voiced bitterness at the entrance by the NATO-led peacekeeping force into the power struggle between Biljana Plavsic, President of the Bosnian Serb republic, and Radovan Karadzic, her predecessor, who has been charged with war crimes. Ms. Plavsic, backed by NATO troops, has taken control of the city of Banja Luka and accused Dr. Karadzic and his supporters in Pale of widespread corruption.
"The international community calls this a democratic election," said Vaskrsije Kusmuk, 65, as he stood with his wife, Milena, 60, in front of a Pale polling station. "If this was really a democratic election we would not have these foreign planes flying over our heads and these foreign tanks rolling through our streets."
"We had more democracy under Tito," he said, referring to the Communist former leader of Yugoslavia. "This is a farce."
The Muslims should gain the most, at least on paper, from these elections. The balloting is expected to hand the main Muslim party nominal control of many towns from which Muslims were expelled by Serbs and Croats during the war.
But even in Sarajevo, a city still scarred by war and burdened by tremendous poverty, it was hard to find much enthusiasm for the vote.
Redzep Beganovic, 21, a badly wounded Muslim war veteran, lives with other destitute men in an abandoned boxcar in back of the gutted shell that was once Sarajevo's train station. He said he was embittered over the Government's failure to assist war invalids or provide him with an apartment. "What has this country given me?" he said. "It is time for me to try and get out. There is not one name on these candidate lists that would be worth making the effort to vote for."
About 2.5 million citizens, including 400,000 outside Bosnia, registered to vote for 136 municipal councils across the country. The United Nations said about 35,000 were expected to cross the line between the Serbian and Muslim-Croatian halves of Bosnia to cast their ballots today and Sunday.
The elections have cost the international community $14 million and are part of the terms imposed by the Dayton peace agreement.

HEADLINE: Fast Track on Treaties Leaves Labor in the Dust

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Mr. Clinton Deserves 'Fast Track' " (editorial, Sept. 8) cavalierly dismisses American workers' concern with competition from foreign low-wage labor on the theoretical ground that the competitive effect of lower wages is canceled out by correspondingly lower productivity. This is typically not true for internationally traded goods. 
 Labor productivity in the auto, electronics and other Mexican maquiladora plants is close to, and sometimes above, that of American factories. Yet Mexican Government policies keep wages at a small fraction of what United States workers make. The disparity between wages and productivity causes expanded trade with the third world to erode living standards in advanced economies. That is why we need strong, enforceable labor standards at the core of any trade agreement. Yet our recent trade deals have protected the interests of international investors over those of workers.
You concede that we should protect labor and the environment but wrongly argue that Representative Bill Archer's proposed language for fast track is "a reasonable compromise." Mr. Archer has said that the proposal is aimed not at strengthening labor and environment laws but at weakening them if they inhibit trade.
Those who care about labor and environmental protections are right to oppose a renewal of fast-track authority until such protections are as guaranteed as the property rights of investors.

HEADLINE: Fast Track on Treaties Leaves Labor in the Dust;
Secret Talks in Paris

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The premise for giving President Clinton fast-track authority, you say, is that "countries will not negotiate trade accords with Washington for fear of endless revision" (editorial, Sept. 8). Yet for the past two years the 29 industrialized members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have been secretly negotiating the Multilateral Agreement on Investment in Paris, with the United States very much involved. 
 The treaty's provisions will override state and local land use, environmental, economic development and labor laws, giving multinationals free rein in any signatory country. It bans performance requirements like the Federal Community Reinvestment Act and domestic content standards. A foreign company that believes the treaty is violated can sue the host government in a secret tribunal from which there is no appeal. Make no mistake, this is the treaty for which President Clinton needs fast-track authority.

HEADLINE: EUROPE: FALL AND WINTER;
The Bargains and the Blowouts

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Given the steep rise of the dollar in the last several months, much of Europe is now a better deal for American travelers than it has been in years. A fine bottle of French merlot, a pair of Ferragamo shoes in Milan or a night at the new Adlon Hotel in Berlin are all about 20 percent cheaper in dollar terms than they would have been a year ago.
Countries that have locked their exchange rates to the German mark -- France, Austria and the Benelux countries -- have all seen their currencies plunge by about 20 percent against the dollar. Spain and Italy have followed suit. The one major exception is the United Kingdom, where the pound and the Irish punt have kept pace with the dollar. No big bargains there. 
 Even with a stronger dollar, things are far from cheap. In many European countries, prices a year ago were 50 percent higher than those in the United States. And some curveballs have been thrown: Local prices for a one-month Eurail train pass covering all of Europe, available only to non-Europeans, have been notched up to keep its dollar price -- $838 -- just as high as it was last year.
On the other hand, with most of Continental Europe still in the economic doldrums, vendors of leisure and luxury goods have been pressed to offer better buys. Discounting now turns up in some of the most unlikely places. The luxury suite I booked at the Schlosshotel Kronberg, for example, is officially listed at $545 a night, but the price I was quoted on the phone was $375. Why? The hotel had plenty of rooms available -- and sooner or later, the law of supply and demand exerts its force. EDMUND L. ANDREWS

HEADLINE: STAGE VIEW;
When These Two Chat, an Era Is Speaking

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
JULIE HARRIS WAS SPEAKING WITH THE urgency of a heroine in a Victorian melodrama who recalls being snatched, at the very last minute, from the path of a speeding train.
"Chris saved the day," she said, in that voice that always seems to glow with illuminated italics. "We would have gone down without him." 
 "Oh, please," snorted the hero in question, Christopher Plummer, in his matinee idol's baritone.
"We would have; we would have," Ms. Harris answered. "It was one of those things. We would have absolutely."
The woman who is often described as the greatest of living American stage actresses was recalling the circumstances under which, 40 years ago, during rehearsals for the play "The Lark," she met the young Canadian now widely considered the finest of this continent's classical stage actors. And although Mr. Plummer's suave, roguish persona is a far cry from Ms. Harris's habitually awe-struck air of a pilgrim in the presence of miracles, they share belief that the theater, as Ms. Harris put it, "should be life and death." And after a half century apiece of performing in it, they both still think of the theater as a home, a religion and the place where they are most comfortable.
Whether they like it or not, Ms. Harris, 71, and Mr. Plummer, 67, are among the last of a breed nearing extinction: stars whose identities have been shaped and renewed almost entirely on the stage. They carry with them a perfume of headier days, when Broadway seemed as cosmopolitan as the martini. But they have never stopped working there. And their conversation -- part banter, part love song -- swirls through the decades, equally piquant on subjects as varied as the grandeur of the Lunts, the de-glamorizing influence of Lee Strasberg and the necessary selfishness of actors.
At the time of this reunion, in a hotel suite on Central Park West with a view of Manhattan as an urban dreamscape, they had both been starring on Broadway throughout the spring and summer, Ms. Harris opposite Charles Durning in "The Gin Game" (it has now moved to Chicago), for which she received her 10th Tony nomination (she has won a record five times) for best actress; Mr. Plummer in his current one-man show "Barrymore," which won him his second Tony Award in June.
The immediate topic, however, was the play that brought Ms. Harris her second Tony, "The Lark," by Jean Anouilh. In 1955, the Broadway-bound production, starring the 29-year-old Ms. Harris as Joan of Arc, was about to open in Boston, and the crucial part of the Earl of Warwick had yet to be cast satisfactorily.
"It was like 'A Shot in the Dark,' " says Ms. Harris, detouring, by way of example, to another production she starred in, in 1961, "when Donald Cook had his heart attack and died in New Haven."
"Oh, my God, yes!" interjected Mr. Plummer.
"And Harold Clurman, who was directing, said to me, 'Well, what do you think?' And I said, 'Well, I don't know: someone like George Sanders or Brian Aherne.' And he said, 'Well, we've got Walter Matthau.' And I said: 'Walter Matthau? What a mistake! Can he be a French banker?' And he was marvelous. And he saved the day."
But back to Mr. Plummer's rescuing act. How did he save the day? ("Yes, how did I?" the actor asked avidly.) "Chris saved the day because we had had two Earls of Warwick," said Ms. Harris, referring to "The Lark's" pivotal role of the worldly, sardonic English nobleman that Mr. Plummer eventually won. Both of his predecessors, Ms. Harris recalled, were quite beautiful looking but not "very compelling."
Then, as Mr. Plummer, describing his advent, put it, "this bum came along," having been vetted by Lillian Hellman, the play's adaptor. "Lillian," said Mr. Plummer, assuming the gangsterish posture of the playwright, "who was smoking thousands of cigarettes all at once, out of the corner of her mouth said, 'He'll do fine.' "
So "The Lark" opened on Broadway, on schedule, with the Earl of Warwick properly cast, on Nov. 17, 1955. Mr. Plummer, who had previously played supporting roles with the legendary Katherine Cornell, was singled out by the critic Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times for offering further evidence of "extraordinary gifts." Ms. Harris, wrote Mr. Atkinson, had "an incandescence that illuminates the theater and touches the hearts of everybody in the audience."
The night of the opening, however, Ms. Harris had gone home to bed after the performance feeling, she said, "suicidal" about the evening. Then she got a phone call telling her the reviews were terrific, so she got out of bed, got dressed and went to the party at the Plaza Hotel.
Mr. Plummer said he had no memory of that party. ("Oh, you must have gone, Chris," said Ms. Harris.) But he vividly recalled Ms. Harris as Joan. "I thought she was the cutest thing" -- Mr. Plummer here took a beat, to underscore the punch line -- "in pants," he said. "You rehearsed, didn't you, in part of your armor?"
"Oh, did I, did I?" said Ms. Harris.
"That thing you have done ever since, actually," continued Mr. Plummer, needling gently. "Didn't you rehearse 'The Gin Game' in armor?"
Actually, both Ms. Harris and Mr. Plummer are among the few actors who still could look perfectly at ease on stage in shiny suits of mail; less so, perhaps, in T-shirts and tatters. In an era of mumbling naturalism, they continue to ply their craft with the heroic presence and ringing enunciation that they believe the theater demands. Ms. Harris has said that there should always be "glory" in the theater; Mr. Plummer, that he has spent much of his life "trying to pretend the ordinary doesn't exist."
Their careers, accordingly, embrace mythic performances: Ms. Harris (at 24) as the tortured 12-year-old tomboy Frankie Addams in Carson McCullers's "Member of the Wedding" (1950); or the feckless, divinely decadent Sally Bowles in "I Am a Camera" (1951), John Van Druten's adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin Stories"; or a truly transcendent Emily Dickinson in her one-woman show "The Belle of Amherst" (1977).
Mr. Plummer's great conquests have been in the classics, starting with a "Henry V," at the Stratford Festival in Ontario in 1956, that Atkinson described as "magnificent" and, on Broadway in 1982, an Iago that the critic Walter Kerr called "quite possibly the best single Shakespearean performance to have originated on this continent."
Both actors grew up -- Ms. Harris in Grosse Pointe, Mich.; Mr. Plummer, in Montreal -- at a time when the theater still shimmered with glamour, and the stage star was considered more godlike than the mere movie star. Both Ms. Harris and Mr. Plummer had theater-loving parents who took their children to see touring productions. "I inherited the wish from them," Ms. Harris, paraphrasing Laurence Oliver, said of her parents. Of what she was seeing on stage, she said, "That was the world to me."
There were still vestiges of that world in the decade in which Ms. Harris and Mr. Plummer made their names, the 1950's, described by Mr. Plummer as "probably the last kind of golden moment in the American theater."
"Yes," answered Ms. Harris quickly, "because the Lunts were still there. Ruth Gordon was still there." "Louis Calhern," said Mr. Plummer, "Tallu Bankhead." And suddenly their conversation became, as it often did that morning, a volley of names recited with the affectionate certainty of a couple recalling the lyrics of their song. When they described these actors, they more often than not became them, in precise, evocative parentheses. To hear Ms. Harris become Boris Karloff, or Mr. Plummer turn into Ruth Gordon, is, believe me, something.
Here is Ms. Harris on auditioning for the regal acting couple Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne: "Miss Fontanne came down the aisle of the theater. And she said, 'NOW THIS PA-A-RT . . . ' And she was all in mink, with pale harlequin glasses, mink beret. I was like a puddle of water in front of her. And she explained the whole part to me. And finally from the back of the theater came this voice: 'LYNNIE, let her READ, for God's sake . . . ' Which was Alfred, with his vicuna coat over the shoulders.
"I mean, they were stars. You saw what that meant. Now we all shuffle along -- " Ms. Harris stopped in midsentence and hunched her shoulders, providing an instant impression of a bag lady.
Mr. Plummer was taken up early on by another fabled theater couple: the actress Katharine Cornell and her husband, the director Guthrie McClintic. "She was a great personality, not a great actress," said Mr. Plummer, reminding Ms. Harris that the stars of those days were often less than versatile. "And Guthrie knew how to light her."
It was McClintic who took Mr. Plummer, then a green 23, to Paris in 1955 to play Jason to the Medea of Judith Anderson, the great Australian actress. They rehearsed, he recalled, in the bar of the Ritz Hotel while the international hostess Elsa Maxwell held the prompt book. "It was quite a time," he said. "Judith lost her voice."
Ms. Harris gasped in sympathy.
"Because she was put into Sarah Bernhardt's dressing room," Mr. Plummer continued. "A huge room, of course, endless, with those big double doors. They open into an anteroom where La Bernhardt used to come out -- "
"In the intermission," said Ms. Harris.
"Yes," Mr. Plummer said, "to greet ambassadors and kings, while the flunkies would open the doors for her. Well, of course all that had gone, but the doors were still there. And this vast room. And way in a tiny little corner at the end of the room sat a makeup table, with one electric light bulb. And Judith Anderson was making herself up there. And I suppose she got -- well, what do you get? You get terrified. Judith, that tough Aussie, she got laryngitis."
The rasping Medea and her young Jason were roasted in the French press. Late in their run, however, the cast was lunching at the historic Parisian restaurant Le Grand Vefour when "this tall creature got up and started to walk toward our table." It was Jean Cocteau, the self-legendizing poet, playwright and artist, who went straight to Anderson. "He takes her hand in his," said Mr. Plummer, shifting into the present tense, "and says, 'Ah, Madame Anderson, you make life' " -- Mr. Plummer slapped his hand on a coffee table -- "and left. Well, it made her whole trip."
The story of the voiceless Judith Anderson, aside from being the perfect show-business anecdote, with its swing from humiliation to triumph, shows how the grandeur of earlier generations was already waning. "Like Chris said, the big doors didn't open anymore," said Ms. Harris.
This was partly, of course, a consequence of the increasing popularity of film and television. But even within the theater, there were demythologizing forces at work, said Mr. Plummer, citing in particular the Actors Studio in New York, the temple of Method performance run by Lee Strasberg.
"I even felt rather old-fashioned in the 50's," said Mr. Plummer, "because the youngsters coming up would say, 'Oh, come on, be real.' So one went around rather desperately trying to be real. And there was kind of a reverse snobbishness about the grandeur of the theater." He also suspected that Strasberg was "actually beginning, cagily, to train people for the movies, not the theater."
Ms. Harris studied at the studio, while Mr. Plummer attended as an observer, where he noticed one thing especially about the proceedings: "It was never fun."
"That's it," said Ms. Harris, recalling a session with Strasberg (a death scene from "Peer Gynt") that she left with a high fever. "No, there weren't many laughs."
"And isn't that the most important thing in the theater," asked Mr. Plummer, "to have fun as well?"
They paused to consider Strasberg's most famous acolyte, Marilyn Monroe. "Oh," said Ms. Harris, "I keep thinking if only she had been delicately, lovingly handled, she could've been a great actress."
"Yes," said Mr. Plummer, "if anyone needed someone who had a sense of fun, Marilyn did. She should've been thinking, 'Oh, it's not so tough, after all.' "
Glamour aside, Ms. Harris and Mr. Plummer believe that the most significant change for the theater actor has been economic. "There was a string of reality that was going through life," said Ms. Harris. "The New York theater, if you got a foothold in it, could be your livelihood. Now you say, 'No, I can't work in the New York theater.' "
"You can't afford it," said Mr. Plummer, who, like Ms. Harris, has worked extensively in film and television, largely "to earn some money."
"Well, it's not there for you," said Ms. Harris, of the New York theater.
Nonetheless, both said they had never considered leaving the theater, despite the toll it had taken on their lives outside it.
"I think families suffer," said Ms. Harris, who has been married and divorced three times and has one son. "In my life, I never could sustain that. I would have loved to have had more children. But I just found it so difficult to maneuver all of those complicated relationships."
"It is a selfish profession," said Mr. Plummer, who has been married to Elaine Taylor, his third wife, for more than 25 years. "You can't avoid that." Of his only child, the actress Amanda Plummer, he said, "She came from a real broken home, because both her mother" -- the actress Tammy Grimes -- "and I weren't there for her, really."
"But she loves you both," said Ms. Harris.
"She does," said Mr. Plummer. "I don't quite know why, but she does. Maybe it's the best way to love a parent, to love it in the mind's eye and not the real thing."
Mr. Plummer said he never considered having another child. "It would have to be brought up by a nanny, and what the hell is the point of that?"
"I know," said Ms. Harris. "I will always remember Boris Karloff saying to me, 'Only have one child.' "
What is it about being on stage that justifies the sacrifices? What does it feel like, at its best, when everything in a performance is working?
Ms. Harris, describing a moment during her run in "The Belle of Amherst," invoked the image of a flying carpet. "I felt toward the end of the play as if it would never end, and I'd always be floating on this wonderful carpet, talking. And people were listening."
"It's wonderful when you know that you can hold a silence in the theater," said Mr. Plummer. "There are very few times this happens. And when it does, you feel you dare to hold it and hold it, and you feel you could hold it forever. That's, I suppose, the greatest feeling in the theater, that they're so with you that they're silent."
What Mr. Plummer described as "the old-style temperamental star" doesn't, he said, exist much today. "Well, there's no time or room anymore," said Ms. Harris. Asked if she had ever indulged in such histrionics herself, she shook her head, chuckling, it seemed, at the absurdity of the question.
"Oh, come on!" Mr. Plummer erupted, delightedly. "Now, come on! I saw you lose it once."
"Oh, I've lost it," said Ms. Harris.
"Oh, yes, we've all lost it," said Mr. Plummer. "We have to lose it. Because you have to shed some tightness." Actually he said, Ms. Harris had exploded, quite rightly, during rehearsals for "The Lark," over something like a lighting cue that kept going wrong. "I was so glad," he said. "You were so sweet otherwise."
HE ALSO SAID HE WOULD NEVER forget the image of Ms. Harris, as Joan, "when she stood up on her little stool, and she screamed for her soldiers, and the tears ran down her face. And, oh, boy, every night, we stood behind her, bawling."
Ms. Harris, lowering her eyes, said she couldn't remember that.
"I think I told Julie that once during the run," said Mr. Plummer. "She said, 'Please don't talk to me about moments!' And I remember I went away thinking, 'Hey, I could really ruin a lot of great actors by telling them how wonderful they were in certain moments.' "
In fact, a great part of the pleasure of listening to him and Ms. Harris was hearing them describe such moments: Mr. Plummer on Ruth Gordon in "The Matchmaker" or Ms. Harris on Laurette Taylor in "The Glass Menagerie." And while both lamented the de-emphasis on what they consider an actor's most essential asset, a well-trained voice, they said they continued to see transporting performances in the theater. Ms. Harris, who usually devoted her two free nights a week during the run of "The Gin Game" to going to other plays, had seen Janet McTeer's recent performance in "A Doll's House" three times.
"My God, Julie, that's going too far," said Mr. Plummer.
"No, no," answered Ms. Harris, "but I love -- theater is -- I mean, I'm still that kind of audience, I just love it."
Ms. Harris also had rhapsodic praise for the Irish actor Donal McCann, whom she saw in two productions in recent years: Sebastian Barry's "Steward of Christendom," at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and Brian Friel's "Faith Healer," for which she drove from her home in Cape Cod to New Haven.
"I love that play," she said of the latter. "You should do that play, Chris." She paused, and a glint of steel suddenly shone in her voice. "We could do that play. Yeah. It's three parts. You'll probably want to play both men. And you could."
"As long as we know that," said Mr. Plummer.
"As long as we know that," Ms. Harris repeated happily.

LAWSUITS
$3.5 Billion for a Rail Fire
Americans have long been litigious. Still, punitive damages of nearly $3.5 billion awarded in connection with a 1987 chemical fire in a New Orleans railway yard stunned participants and independent analysts alike. "This case shows that our system has turned into the world's richest roulette wheel," said Victor E. Schwartz, a Washington liability lawyer. CSX, which owned the tracks where the accident occurred, was assessed $2.5 billion, even though the National Transportation Safety Board found that it was not responsible for the leak that caused the fire. Some 8,000 people were evacuated from their homes for 36 hours. Questions were raised about the fire's long-term health effects, but no definitive studies have established lasting medical damage. The size of the judgment -- seven times the 1989 payout for the chemical explosion at Bhopal, India, that killed 3,000 people -- may be partly explained by the residents' anger at the storage of toxic chemicals in rail cars in their poor, largely black neighborhood. CSX is appealing. 

THE ECONOMY
Workers Get More Credit
The productivity of American workers grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent, far more than originally estimated, the Labor Department reported. Some economists have concluded that the country is heading back toward a level of efficiency characteristic of the prosperous early postwar period, but absent for the last 25 years. And what did those busy workers do when they weren't working? They shopped: consumer installment credit climbed in July at a 6.4 percent annual rate, by an unexpectedly strong $6.5 billion, reflecting a bounce in new-car borrowing and credit-card use. Retail sales rose 0.4 percent in August, topping off a three-month summer rebound after a cool spring, but the gain was less than expected. Further, the Producer Price Index for August rose 0.3 percent after falling 0.1 percent in July. It was the first gain in the index since a 0.5 percent rise in December. The nation's deficit on the current account, the broadest measure of international trade, narrowed to $39.03 billion in the second quarter from a revised $39.97 billion in the first quarter.
 
MARKETS
A Chill for Blue Chips
The stock market, after opening the week on a positive note, changed directions on Wednesday and retreated, only to rise just as the week ended. Still, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 79.44 points for the week, closing at 7,742.97, while the Nasdaq composite index edged up 13.56, closing at 1,649.33. Although the latest economic reports were favorably received as showing steady economic growth with little inflation, a surprise warning by Motorola that it would not meet earnings expectations led some investors to sell shares of large multinational companies in favor of smaller stocks.
 
BROKERS
Charles Schwab, Underwriter
Charles Schwab & Company, the country's largest discount brokerage firm, agreed with three Wall Street firms to help underwrite public stock offerings. The deal will allow customers of Schwab's retail brokerage service to invest directly in public stock offerings led by Credit Suisse First Boston, Hambrecht & Quist or J. P. Morgan. The agreement is a big departure from Schwab's traditional business of processing customers' buy and sell orders. As an underwriter, Schwab will presumably put its own capital at risk and take a direct role in helping corporations raise money.
 
CITY KIOSKS
Service Without Attitude
A New York City worker who labors 24 hours a day with no complaints? New Yorkers can now use 37 experimental A.T.M.-like machines to pay parking tickets and property taxes with a credit card or bank card; check building-
inspection records; print application forms for permits, licenses and civil service jobs, and get answers to a host of questions. But New York is no pioneer. From Texas to Pennsylvania and Utah to Maryland, state and local governments are trying to streamline their bureaucracies by using interactive kiosks. In New York the machines are in sites as diverse as the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, Bellevue Hospital Center, the borough halls in Brooklyn and Queens, and 10 check-cashing outlets. They charge $3.50 for each transaction.
 
tHE ENVIRONMENT
Black Gold vs. Green
Despite the objections of Federal environmental agencies, the Clinton Administration approved Conoco's drilling of an exploratory oil well on Federal land in the red-rock country of Utah. Last year President Clinton established the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to protect the rich wilderness from development. But oil companies' trespasses can have far-reaching effects. Central Park in New York is among the beneficiaries of $900 million that Exxon agreed to pay for environmental good works around the nation, a penance for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, in which 11 million gallons of oil poured into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound in Alaska.
 
TECHNOLOGY
New Links in Cyberspace
Worldcom, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance phone company, agreed to acquire Compuserve for nearly $1.2 billion in stock. It will keep Compuserve's high-speed telecommunications lines and Internet gateways but sell the on-line subscription service, which has 2.6 million subscribers worldwide, to America Online. In turn, America Online is to sell its Internet telecommunications unit, ANS, to Worldcom. After the cash and asset swap, the imputed value of Compuserve's on-line service is $250 million, which would seem to show that the real value lies in the dull plumbing of cyberspace, not the glamour of the on-line service. Separately, a powerful team of companies is challenging a Microsoft plan, involving the purchase of a TV set-top device, to dominate the Internet via cable television. The challengers would treat the Internet as a premium cable service.
 
TAXES
Credit Cards? Not Yet
By early 1999 taxpayers need not send the I.R.S. a check. They can just tell the agency to dip into their bank accounts. But the Treasury said it had yet to figure out how consumers could pay their taxes with credit cards. Both means of payment were authorized by the budget-balancing tax legislation of the summer, and the I.R.S. likes them because they may encourage people to file electronically. That saves the Government a lot of data-entry work. The problem with credit cards is that the issuers charge fees to participating merchants, and the Government is barred from paying a fee.
 
JAPAN
A New Tax Adds to Trouble
In the second quarter, Japan's economy saw its sharpest contraction since the oil shock of 23 years ago. Economic output fell at a startling annual rate of 11.2 percent, the Government said. The sizable drop, attributed to a sharp increase in the national sales tax, dashed hopes for an early recovery from the nation's long economic slump.

At Fair Lawn Business Park, the Prospect Is Housing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: FAIR LAWN

 BODY:
IN the last 25 years the owners of the 150-acre Fair Lawn Business and Technical Center along Route 208 in this Bergen County community have proposed five projects -- including a million-square-foot commercial complex -- for the remaining 20 acres of their campus.
But none pleased the borough and they were eventually withdrawn, leaving the site in its natural state as a rare patch of farmland used as cornfields. 
 Last month, however, Fair Lawn's Planning Board granted preliminary approval to develop the property into a rental community of 340 apartments, 52 of them for tenants with low and moderate incomes, including 14 units for tenants 62 and older. It is expected to cost as much as $125 million.
Work on the project, now known as Fair Lawn Commons, will start once the remaining local and county permits are obtained, which is expected this fall. It will be developed over the next two years by the center's owners, McBride Enterprises of Franklin Lakes, in partnership with Pinnacle Communities Ltd. and Garden Homes, both based in Short Hills. Financing is coming from PNC Bank in East Brunswick and the partners' own equity.
Edward J. Trawinski, the Mayor of Fair Lawn, said the project will achieve two important municipal goals. Mr. Trawinksi said that it puts land that now generates nominal taxes because of its "farm exempt status" back on the tax rolls, and it also enables the borough to fulfill its obligation under the state's Mount Laurel doctrines.
Those doctrines require municipalities to provide opportunities for developing housing for people making 50 to 80 percent of the median income in the area. Fair Lawn's fair-share obligation is for 52 Mount Laurel units.
Since the program relies in large measure on building market-rate houses to underwrite the affordable ones -- typically in attached-housing projects built at a ratio of four market-rate units to one for low- or moderate-income occupants -- the state's improving residential marketplace is nudging along the production of Mount Laurel units.
"We are seeing a pickup in the number of towns coming in to file their affordable housing plans because they are seeing pressure from developers in their towns or in nearby towns," said Sidna B. Mitchell, spokeswoman for the Council on Affordable Housing, which oversees Mount Laurel issues. If a muncipality's housing plan is approved by the council it is protected from suits by developers for six years.
Ms. Mitchell said that towns were also looking to do rentals because the council in 1994 revised its rules to increase the Mount Laurel credits it gives to towns for such units to 2 from 1.3 per unit when the beneficiary family does not have to be elderly. The added credits seem to be "enough of a carrot" to spur construction, she said.
FOR builders the motivation to put up rental properties is the combination of available financing and a strenghtening demand for market-rate rental apartments. Evidence of that is in the buildings containing some 2,000 rental apartments under way or about to begin along the Hudson River waterfront.
Now the activity is also spreading into other areas of northern and central New Jersey where new construction has been spotty for the last two decades.
"There is more confidence today to move ahead with rental projects," said Nathan Slovin, executive vice president of the New Jersey Apartment Association, a trade group in East Brunswick. "And many are designed to meet Mount Laurel."
Also fueling developer interest, he said, is a law enacted last June that makes permanent exemptions on new apartments from rent control, considered a major barrier to construction. The exemptions were due to expire this year. "In addition," said Mr. Slovin, "the supply of rental housing in the state does not meet the demand."
The alignment of market conditions and municipal objectives were factors in breaking the decades-long logjam on the Fair Lawn site. Its development will bring to a close construction at the business and technical center, which began in the late 1950's as one of the first industrial parks in the state and the nation.
Today, it contains 2.5 million square feet of office research and manufacturing space in 21 buildings. Among them are an 85,000-square-foot office structure for Eastman Kodak and Nabisco's 575,000-square-foot manufacturing plant, from which wafts the sweet smell of baking cookies.
Most of the earlier plans -- like the one-million-square-foot hotel and office complex and another calling for a cluster of office buildings -- centered on commercial development. But the fifth proposal called for a mix of retail space, including a supermarket, and housing.
All were resisted by the borough because of traffic and density issues, said Mayor Trawinski. He said the current plan "represents a compromise between the property owner's rights and the desire of the municipality for controlled growth."
"Rental housing is a reasonable use of the land and provides a reasonable return on our investment," said David F. McBride, chief executive at McBride Enterprises. Now, he added, is a good time to build this project "because there is a need for rentals in this part of Bergen County."
To move the project forward McBride joined forces with Pinnacle Communities and Garden Homes, experienced housing developers. "It is an opportunity to develop luxury apartments in a great area," said Brian M. Stolar, president of Pinnacle. "For-sale housing has also gotten very expensive and for a certain percentage of the population luxury rental housing makes a lot of sense."
He said the partners spent the last year working with borough officials on how best to design the project while addressing such issues as drainage, traffic and density.
FAIR LAWN, as part of its plan for low- and moderate-income housing, designated the site for 300 multifamily housing units, 60 of them for lower incomes. The partners initially proposed 400 units, of which 60 would be affordable. Earlier this year the parties reached an agreement under which the site was rezoned to accommodate the project at its current scale, "which we feel maintains its economic viability," said Charles H. Tint, director of acquisition and land development at Pinnacle.
The partners will also make a number of off-site road improvements, including contributing to the widening of Fair Lawn Avenue, a main roadway abutting the site and extending Pollitt Drive to create a secondary entrance to the project. They will also carve out a one-acre manmade pond, that will double as a detention basin to manage storm water runoff from the site, and will landscape its border with Route 208 to buffer the project from the highway.
All the apartments at Fair Lawn Commons will be contained in 21 residential buildings grouped in seven clusters on both sides of a landscaped central boulevard. Each cluster will front a parking court for convenient access to the apartments.
Each of the two- and three-story brick and vinyl-sided buildings, designed in colonial style by EDI Architecture of Manhattan, will house 12 to 24 apartments. Planned amenities will include a 3,000-square-foot clubhouse, walking paths and a children's play area.
The market-rate units will have one to three bedrooms and 800 to 1,250 square feet of space; some will have car ports. Monthly rents for those apartments are expected to start at $900 for the smaller units and $1,400 for the larger ones. The Mount Laurel units will have the same number of bedrooms but will be smaller. Rents will range from $405 to $945.
Asked if there was any community opposition to the project Mayor Trawinski said: "The night we voted on it not one member of the public was present because by that time all of the borough's concerns were more than adequately addressed."

THE WAY WE REALLY ARE
 Coming to Terms With
 America's Changing Families.
 By Stephanie Coontz.
 238 pp. New York:
 Basic Books. $23. 
 THE publication of "The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap," Stephanie Coontz's previous book, came in time for that book to serve as fodder in the "family values" debate that dominated the 1992 election. What might have been merely a well-received, clearly written book by an academic became fuel in the sound-bite fires and set the author, a historian at Evergreen State College in Oregon, on the road. The reception of that book perhaps contributed to the accessible tone of Coontz's follow-up, a look at the contemporary American family called "The Way We Really Are: Coming to Terms With America's Changing Families."
Coontz's travels took her to "Oprah" and "Crossfire," on many long plane flights where she often fell into conversation with fellow passengers, to lecture podiums across the country, to P.T.A. forums and drug and alcohol rehabilitation workshops. She listened well and learned a lot about fragmented debate and garbled information, about abrupt intimacy in public places, about fact and fiction in American family life. She has now attempted to "get beyond the rhetoric" and show that "history and social science do have concrete applications and positive lessons" for ordinary citizens.
Drawing on journalism as well as scholarship, she includes almost 50 pages of notes in addition to the modest 177 pages of text. Her book should offer reassurance to people in every kind of family muddling through every stressful stage. Her most important lesson, which she repeats one way and another, again and again, is that "the only way to get past the polarized testimonies for and against 1950's families is to put their strengths and weaknesses into historical perspective." She appreciates the fact of change in American history and constantly emphasizes it, so that, for example, in the chapter explaining "Why Working Mothers Are Here to Stay" she summarizes an important aspect of the industrial revolution as "The Late Birth and Short Life of the Male Breadwinner Family."
Addressing adult uneasiness about and around teen-agers, she shifts the terms of the debate from angry reproach to provocative compassion: "The best way I've found to personally confirm the sociological studies of rolelessness is to ask older men to talk about their life histories." Invariably, she says, they answer their own frustrated questions.
The experience of work has become very different for young people: "The typical job a teen-ager can get today provides neither the self-pride of economic independence nor the socializing benefits of working alongside adult mentors. . . . Work relations seem to have been critical experiences for the socialization of many young men in the past. Such jobs integrated youths into adult society . . . instead of segregating them in a separate peer culture." One telling statistic she cites: As recently as 1940, 60 percent of employed adolescents worked in traditional workplaces, acquiring skills they might use for the rest of their lives. By 1980, that figure had dropped to just 14 percent.
A chapter called "Working With What We've Got" contains a gem of insight about adapting to diversity in family structure. Some elementary school teachers who noticed homework stress in children from single-parent and dual-working-parent families gave students the assignment to read aloud to their parents several nights a week. How much nicer for a child to read to a parent who is fixing dinner than to sit alone with the television set while the parent feels stressed and alone in the kitchen. Another assignment was for a child to do comparison math while shopping with a parent.
That little example is typical of the pragmatic optimism that runs through Stephanie Coontz's book. Just think, she says, "how much we could accomplish if we stopped expecting nontraditional families to fail and started thinking creatively about how to help every family build on its resources and minimize its vulnerabilities." Agreed.

HEADLINE: Any Way You Look at It, It's Up

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
IT has been a good year in just about every segment of the real estate industry in the New York metropolitan area. Office vacancy rates are down and effective rents are moving upward. Building sales have been brisk and some eye-popping prices are being paid.
New construction is under way in midtown, with more to come, and new buildings are rising in New Jersey and Fairfield County as well. Retailers are clamoring for newer, bigger locations. The city's hotels are, for all practical purposes, filled to capacity. 
 Along with all this welcome prosperity some brokers and investors are beginning to worry: Is it starting to get too hot?
In 1996, the Insignia/ESG real estate concern counted 8.2 million square feet of office properties that were sold in midtown at an average price of $99 a square foot. In the first seven months of this year, 6.1 million square feet sold at an average that almost doubled to $183.12 per square foot.
Some properties are above average, of course. A building at 135 East 57th street sold for $313 a square foot, while another at 527 Madison Avenue, at 54th Street, commanded $311 a square foot. The record setter was the triangular tower at 1 Times Square, which sold for about $1,000 a square foot, but that was more because of its value as a base for signs than its attractiveness as an office building.
"I have not seen anything like this since the 1980's," said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, which specializes in building sales. "We are doing twice our normal volume in a frenetic atmosphere. We're seeing deals done over the asking price."
Fueling the bidding for properties is the ready availability of capital from sources not present in the last up cycle: real estate investment trusts and investment bankers on Wall Street. "The Wall Street guys are focusing on real estate as a way of generating fees," Mr. Hauspurg said. "They are behind these office deals. There is more money around than I have ever seen."
"Between the REIT's and Wall Street there is an inordinate amount of capital chasing a few deals," said Bruce Mosler, an executive director of the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage firm. "It's driving prices past what the cash flow justifies."
The influence of the REIT's was also cited by Richard B. Baxter, a senior managing director at Insignia/ESG. "There are multiple bids on every property that comes to market," he said. "It's literally a buying frenzy driven by REIT's new to the market." He said the high prices were being fetched by buildings that are almost fully leased and have an assured income stream.
"REIT's are a relatively new phenomenon and in the past they preferred suburban locations to central business districts," said John Powers, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG. "But now they are larger and are starting to invest in big-city buildings." Mr. Powers noted that because of their structure, REIT's have to grow to meet the performance expectations of investors. Indeed, the single biggest deal so far this year was the sale of seven buildings, with a total of 5.2 million square feet of space, by the developer and investor Bernard H. Mendik to Vornado Realty Trust, a REIT, for $656 million.
Some of the sales are interesting because of the trends they signal, executives say. "The sale of 100 Wall Street is an indication of the rebound of the office market downtown," said Warren M. Heller, a senior director of Jones Lang Wooton. Mr. Heller, who is known as Woody, said the trend toward converting downtown buildings to residential use is likely to slow as a result of the increase in office values.
The 29-story building at 100 Wall Street was purchased by the Witkoff Group for $34 million, which at $72 a square foot, would be too steep for a conversion, investment advisors say. Its major tenants are insurance companies and securities firms.
Some of the transactions can be confusingly complex. Mr. Hauspurg noted that the sale of 135 East 57th Street did not include the ground under the building, despite the steep $314 per square foot price paid. "The ground rent is like a second mortgage," he said. "It adds about $10 a foot to the deal."
The sale of 505 Park Avenue, which is a 59th Street, to the Hong Kong-based Glorious Sun group shows the importance of foreign investors in the New York market, he added. Glorious Sun paid $48 million, or a relatively steep $240 a square foot, for the 48 year old, 22-story building that was once part of the Uris family's holdings.
ALTHOUGH some prices being paid for buildings are raising eyebrows, since they can only be economically justified by a steady increase in rental rates, real estate executives say the situation is vastly different from that of the late 1980's. That is because there has been almost no new construction during the decade.
"This is not the same situation as when the market fell out in 1987," said Mr. Mosler. "You had a huge oversupply of office space then, and that is not the case today." In fact, the 48-story, 1.6 million-square-foot building now being built for the Durst Organization at Broadway and 42d Street is the first major office structure to be started since the 1980's. The most recently completed private office buildings were the structures at 1540 and 1585 Broadway, which are occupied by Bertelsmann and Morgan Stanley, which were started in the mid 1980s and occupied in the early 1990s.
"We are still on the upside of the cycle, but the question is how high is high and how long is long," said Barry M. Gosin, the vice chairman and chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate. He said the recovery in demand for office space was largely being driven by the securities and finance industry and related entities, like law and accounting firms, that resisted hiring large numbers of people until recently despite seven years of a strong stock market.
"If the Dow drops 20 percent, Wall Street will reduce employment and that will affect real estate," Mr. Gosin said. He said that with Wall Street firms backing investors who are paying high prices for properties, "maybe the investment banks will be left holding the bag this time."
Not surprisingly, the managers of those companies think they are astute enough to avoid pitfalls. "The underlying leasing market in New York is up substantially," said Russell Appel, one of the managers of CS First Boston's Praedium Funds, which specializes in investing in smaller properties. "And the prices we are paying are well below replacement costs." He said the development of public markets for real estate debt has added liquidity to transactions, thus reducing the amount of funds investors need to buy a property. "You do not need 50 percent equity anymore; now it is 10 to 30 percent which makes buildings more affordable."
One indication of the current strength of the market is the way long-stalled deals are starting to happen.
For over 10 years the building occupying the block bounded by 46th and 47th Streets and Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues has stood empty. Disputes over control of the land and over the availability of air rights to increase the size of what could be erected on the site prevented development while the market was strong in the 1980's, and the fall in demand for office space in the early 1990's left developers uninterested.
But late in August, the investment banking firm Bear, Stearns & Company announced that it had signed a 99-year lease on the site and would use it to build a 1.1 million- square-foot office tower.
Another prominent building site, the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, is reported to be the location of a 32-story headquarters for the Reuters news service, to be built in association with the Rudin Management Company.
But new development is expensive and few sites have the tax advantages of the Times Square area. So real estate executives do not expect a burst of new construction. Instead, they say, older buildings in good locations are likely to be acquired and brought to Class A status for 30 to 40 percent less than the cost of new construction.
One area drawing a lot of attention is part of the old Garment District between Penn Station and Times Square.
"I think that area is going to be like Park Avenue South was in the 1980's," said Darcy Stacom, an executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. "The buildings are older, but they are large, with big windows, and they lay out easily."
Real estate executives say the area's new image will become clearer if the Ted Bates advertising agency, as expected, signs up for 300,000 square feet in a building on Seventh Avenue between 36th and 37th Streets. The agency is expected to leave its current quarters in the Chrysler Building.
"We are finally getting positive absorption of office space after years of playing musical chairs," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenants' broker. He said a tightening market in midtown will drive tenants to the other boroughs, suburbs and areas of Manhattan they never previously considered.
"I think you are going to see a lot of renovation in the area between 34th and 40th Street and Sixth Avenue and Broadway," he said. "The area has great mass transit."
The drive into new areas is expected to be fueled by a tightening market in the established midtown market. According to a report prepared by Newmark, the vacancy rate for both Class A and B properties fell to 8 percent during the first half of the year. This drove average rents in Class A buildings from $36.19 per square foot to $37.58 per foot, the highest level of the 1990's.
Here is a look at what has happened this year in other segments of the market.
 
In the Suburbs:
New Construction
New construction is under way in New Jersey and Fairfield County, Conn., while conversions of older Class B buildings and industrial properties to Class A offices predominate on Long Island. Westchester County, disproportionately affected by corporate downsizing, remains the softest of suburban office markets, brokers report.
"It a great time to be an owner -- finally," said Donald Eisen, who specializes in suburban markets for Cushman & Wakefield. "Rents are up to the point -- the mid $20's in New Jersey, about $35 in Connecticut -- where new building is possible again."
Indeed, some people are seeing preliminary indications of rent spikes in places like Stamford, where office space is growing scarce but new building is difficult. "In Stamford, rents have gone from $22 a foot to over $30," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W & M properties, which has investments in that city. Such incentives as periods without rent and the amount of interior refurbishing and remodeling paid for by landlords, known as work letters, are also dropping sharply. "Free rent has gone from one year on a 10-year lease to zero," Mr. Malkin said. "The work letter has gone from $40 a foot to $10 a foot or take-it-as-it-is. That looks like a spike."
Nevertheless, because of the experience of the early 90's, a sense of caution remains. Most new construction under way in Fairfield and Westchester is in the form of buildings designed for and to be largely occupied by a single user, such as the one being built for Swiss Bank in Stamford and the new headquarters for I.B.M. in Armonk, N.Y. Brokers say developers need to demonstrate they have an anchor tenant occupying at least 50 percent of the space before they can get financing.
Even buildings billed as purely speculative in New Jersey seem to lease a lot of space early in construction, strongly suggesting the developers were confident they had deals in hand before getting under way. "Space is tight," Mr. Eisen said, talking specifically about New Jersey. "You hear brokers tell stories about showing space to a client and calling back a week later and find that it is gone. In some cases landlords are picking which of several deals they want."
 
Retail Leasing:
An Increased Demand
A strong local economy and the boost added by tourist spending has made retailers prosperous. That has led, in turn, to increased demand for store locations and higher prices.
"Rents are up 18 to 20 percent across the board from last year," said Faith H. Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, a brokerage specializing in retail space. In some places the contracts for new rentals that are being signed reflect climbs that are even higher than the overall averages, she said.
"Space in SoHo that was going for $50 to $75 a foot last year is $150 a foot now," Ms. Consolo said.
Retail specialists say a big event of the year will be when the managers of Rockefeller Center announce their plans for the redevelopment of the retail space in the famous landmark. Officials of Tishman-Speyer Properties, which is an investor and manager of the building complex, say they expect to go public with their plans before the end of the year.
Most retail specialists say they expect larger, multilevel stores to replace the single-story shops on the first floor and lower-level concourse. And they expect the center's managers to try to anchor the rearranged space with a big- name tenant, as they did when they attracted the Christie's auction house to part of a garage building.
"I can't think of a better place for a shopping mall anywhere in the world," said Alan Victor, executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, retail brokers and consultants. "The location is 100 percent and a new approach should be the end of years and years of boring nothingness on the ground floor."
Brokers say the anticipated opening up of the Rockefeller Center retail space mirrors what is happening all over town, as retailers seek larger spaces. "A few years ago, 2,000 to 5,000 square feet was the norm in Manhattan," Ms. Consolo said. "Now, it is more like 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. We have to look for two or three stores and try to put them together for one user."
Brokers say they expect more entertainment companies, such as MGM and Viacom, to join Disney and Warner Brothers in the retail business. They also expect more sports-theme stores, like Nike's temple of sneakers on 57th Street, to come to town.
The need for retail space, in addition to the hot areas along Madison Avenue, in midtown and in SoHo, is helping revitalize previously rundown locations such as on Eighth Avenue between 42d Street and Columbus Circle and near Madison Square in Midtown South.
Brokers note that the anticipated redevelopment of Eighth Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets, with the Tishman E-Walk entertainment retail project and hotel, and the plans to revitalize the Coliseum site on Columbus Circle, are already promoting development at sites between, including the conversion of at least one pornography movie house into a restaurant.
"The real sleeper is the Madison Square area between 23d Street and 33d Street," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services. He noted that the Credit Suisse First Boston investment banking house had agreed to move into the rehabilitated building owned by Metropolitan Life facing the park between 24th and 25th streets and that new restaurants and rehabilitated hotels are opening in the area.
"The pioneers are already there, the architecture of the buildings is fabulous and the rents are cheap," Mr. Fox said. "That is a formula for a regeneration."
Although rents approaching $500 a foot for retail properties in super-prime locations like 57th Street and Madison Avenue have been reported, Mr. Fox, for one, warns investors in buildings not to place too much emphasis on the value of ground-floor space.
"It is very dangerous to have investors buying properties based on the value of the ground-floor spaces," he said. Faced with a huge rent bill when sales soften, a retailer might decide to declare bankruptcy and walk away from the deal. "If the tenant goes bankrupt, the investor could lose the property. We have seen it before."
 
Hotels:
Occupancy Rate Rises
New York's hotels are all but full. According to figures compiled by PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels, the occupancy rate of the city's hotels during the first eight months of this year was 81.0 percent, compared to a rate of 78.9 percent in the comparable period last year.
"We are projecting a full-year occupancy rate of about 83 percent compared to the 1996 rate of 81.6 percent," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF. "It is unlikely that you will see much of an increase above this year's occupancy rate because we are already so full."
With tourism booming and rooms hard to find, hotel operators have plenty of flexibility to increase prices. According to the PKF figures, the average room rate through July of this year was $179.64, a solid 10.4 percent gain over the average of $162.75 in the comparable period of 1996.
The demand is spread all across the price spectrum, according to other researchers. Deluxe, first-class, convention and tourist-class hotels all experienced occupancy gains in the first half of the year, with tourist-class hotels rising to 83.4 percent occupancy from 74.2 percent during the first half of 1996. Only luxury hotels recorded a slight drop, to 77.5 percent from 77.7 percent, which was more than offset by a 13.4 percent increase in room rates to $236.32 from $208.38.
Given a level of prosperity that most industry analysts say is the best in 20 years, there is a lot of talk about building new hotels and converting existing buildings at least partially for lodging. "There are 19 hotel projects under development or in the planning stages in Manhattan, which is an extraordinary number and more than any point in the last eight years," said Arthur Adler, the lead New York partner in Coopers & Lybrand's lodging group.
But for all the talk, few spades are going into the ground. A 244-room Marriott Courtyard is under way on 40th Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway and a 400-room Embassy Suites is expected to be started by Forest City Ratner Enterprises before the end of the year in Battery Park City. A Marriott is being built in downtown Brooklyn next tor the Metrotech complex, and several conversions are in different stages of completion.
A new hotel in the Times Square area may be in the works as well. Last week, Planet Hollywood was reported to be negotiating with a European investment group to build a 50 story hotel at the southwest corner of Broadway and 47th Street that would include its signature restaurant.
Lodging analysts say the high costs of building in New York, and the competition from residential housing, have held down the number of hotel projects. "It's a red-hot market, but not a lot of hotels are being built," said Michael Fishbin, a hotel consultant with E&Y Kenneth Leventhal.
"In some cases the highest and best use is residential," he added. "The Mayfair was converted from a hotel to condominiums and the St. Moritz is being actively evaluated for conversion as well."

ALL OVER
 BUT THE SHOUTIN'
 By Rick Bragg.
 Illustrated. 329 pp. New York:
 Pantheon Books. $25. 
 There is an old saying among African-Americans to the effect that any white man who lives in poverty does so by choice. This saying is based on the premise that being born with white skin is so great an advantage as to determine a successful life. The colloquialism for disadvantaged Caucasians, "white trash," indicates that the nation as a whole holds these people responsible for their station as well. "Trash" means something without value, something unworthy of our attention and barely worthy of our contempt.
In his sad, beautiful, funny and moving memoir, "All Over but the Shoutin', " Rick Bragg gives us a report from the forgotten heart of "white trash" America, a sort of "Pilgrim's Progress" or "Up From Slavery" about how a clever and determined young man outwitted fate. The story he tells, of white suffering and disenfranchisment, is one too seldom heard. It is as if a descendant of one of the hollow-eyed children from "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men" had stepped out of a photograph to tell his own story, to narrate an experience that even Agee could not penetrate because he was not himself "trash."
Bragg, like the boys and girls around him in isolated and impoverished northeastern Alabama, did not choose to be poor. Along with them, he was intended in the rigid hierarchy of American life to be a logger, or to work in a pulp mill, or to drink and carouse and engage in the sort of small-scale criminal activity that leads to a fair portion of your life being spent behind bars. Instead he became, by his mid-30's, a Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent for The New York Times. "All Over but the Shoutin' " is the story of that rise.
There is an early picture in the story that serves as an imaginative metaphor for the whole: Bragg recalls sitting on a gunny sack at the age of 2 or 3 and being dragged through a field by his mother. It is only years later that he realizes she had been working, picking cotton -- degrading and backbreaking labor that could only have been made more onerous by the presence of a toddler. "The tall woman is wearing a man's britches and a man's old straw hat, and now and then she looks back over her shoulder to smile at the 3-year-old boy whose hair is almost as purely white as the bolls she picks, who rides the back of the six-foot-long sack like a magic carpet." Turning hard scrabble into a pleasant memory was something Margaret Bragg would do for her boy again and again as he grew.
Her sacrifice and suffering form the core of Bragg's experience and so of this book. How did she let him dream in the face of such discouragement, how did she protect his spirit from being broken, as so many others were? The father of the family, a hard-drinking and violent ne'er-do-well, is never more than intermittently involved in Bragg's life, and is gone for good by the time the boy is in elementary school. His brothers grow up to lives very different from his: Sam, several years older, is forced by circumstance to leave school early and begin what will be a life of working with his hands and back to try to make up, economically, for the absence of the father (Bragg relates, heartbreakingly, how Sam was made to "work off" Federal entitlements like school lunches by callous teachers and school administrators); his younger brother, Mark, falls into the pernicious Appalachian life style of alcoholism, making illegal liquor and being permanently situated on the wrong side of the law. This is the psychological and emotional landscape Bragg looks back on as he reconstructs his life.
Bragg is painfully honest about his feelings of insecurity and inadequacy as he moved among his "betters" -- "the old-money white Southerners who ran things, who treated the rest of the South like beggars with muddy feet who were about to track up their white shag carpeting." He writes of a thwarted school love affair: "They named the sections of the divided classroom after birds. She was a Cardinal, one of the children of the well-to-do who studied from nice books with bright pictures, and I was a Jaybird, one of the poor or just plain dumb children who got what was left after the good books were passed out. . . . The teacher -- and I will always, always remember this -- told me I would be much more comfortable with my own kind. I was 6, but even at 6 you understand what it means to be told you are not good enough to sit with the well scrubbed."
In a time when Bragg's family was at rock bottom, without food, a black boy from down the road brought them some corn his mother had sent over. "In the few contacts we had with them as children, we had thrown rocks at them . . . I would like to say that we came together after the little boy brought us that food, that we learned about and from each other, but that would be a lie." In the brutal realities faced by those like Bragg who were not "white," not really, poor whites chose not to band together with blacks but to instead live in "two separate, distinct states." One would have liked to see even more commentary on this critical topic from so honest and thoughtful an observer.
After very limited college experience and very good luck (Bragg, at the age of 18, gets a job at a local paper when the first choice decides to remain employed at Kentucky Fried Chicken), he commences a rapid climb through the ranks of the newspaper trade, starting as a sports reporter in small towns in Alabama and getting a steady succession of better jobs through his plucky Ragged Dick combination of large talent and sheer will. Bragg moves to a new city just about every year for 10 years, moving ever farther away from the strict but sure comforts of his family back home and ever farther into "enemy territory," the polite and at best indifferent precincts of the white middle and upper classes.
From the vantage point of adulthood, Bragg contemplates "how I got over" the extent of his mother's accomplishment in not letting him be broken. He spends much of his rise scheming and saving to buy her a house. Gradually the reader becomes aware that what Bragg is really trying to buy for her is a place in the world, a place from which she doesn't have to move, a place where Mrs. Bragg can, for once, sit still, and be unconcerned with practical exigencies, be insulated from whatever random difficulties and humiliations the given day may bring. It is this sort of life-or-death urgency that gives his tale its majesty and power.
Bragg is showing us a place we have not seen before, not quite like this. And he is joining an elite group of American writers who have used the literature of childhood to affect our understanding of our society, standing in the tradition of Huck and Tom, Holden Caulfield and Dorothy Allison's Bone Boatwright, of Richard Wright and Harry Crews, those hardheaded but bighearted malcontents who ricochet through the land making trouble and keeping the rest of us honest.
There are books that let us see clearly a time and place; there are books that allow us to feel that we are experiencing with truth and accuracy the life of another person. Rick Bragg has written the kind of book that causes us to see ourselves more clearly because it corrects and heightens our vision, and through this vision we see for the first time the humanity of others and are able to imagine, if only for a moment, that unbridgeable divides can somehow, because of what we have learned we have in common, be surmounted.

HEADLINE: Hawaii With Julia: An Idyll

BYLINE: By Jonathan Raban; Jonathan Raban's most recent book is "Bad Land: An American Romance" (Pantheon).

 BODY:
When we stepped off the plane into the sauna weather of a Honolulu evening in late December, my old friend Paul was waiting for us at the gate, carrying a brown paper bag, packed by his wife and full of gifts for my companion -- a lei, a hula skirt, a straw sun hat and a rainbow bikini. Everything, except for the bikini, which I nixed, was donned then and there, while our fellow passengers surged past us. Hatted, garlanded, hula skirt swirling, my companion strode off toward baggage claim. She looked like the tourist from hell.
Julia is 4, and it was for her sake, mostly, that we were here. I like the sea, but not the seaside, and Hawaii has always struck me as too blatantly cliched a destination. But 4-year-olds have rigidly conventional tastes in travel, and for Julia there was still unsullied magic in the idea of sun, sand, sea, a "tropical paradise" with ... 
 "Palm trees!" she yelled, "Look! Palm trees!" joyfully incredulous at seeing the illustrations to "Curious George" and "The Enormous Crocodile" spring suddenly into 3-D all around her. "Why do they have those rings on them?" Each tree had a tin sleeve on its trunk, 15 feet above ground level.
"To stop the mice and rats from climbing up and eating the coconuts," Paul said. Julia stored this piece of information, her first serious nugget of Hawaiian lore. On the drive into town, she gazed perplexedly at the familiar signs, street lamps, traffic signals. "I keep thinking I'm in Seattle, but I know I'm in Hawaii." To Paul she explained: "Hawaii is always hot because it's nearer to the sun."
At the seafood restaurant where we were meeting Sheila, Paul's wife, Julia took the maitre d'hotel into her confidence: "I know I look like a Hawaiian girl, but I'm not really a Hawaiian girl. Actually, I'm from Seattle." The maitre d' did his best to appear astonished by this revelation.
The kids' menu yielded pizza. "They have pizza in Hawaii!" Sometimes life just goes on getting better. But after one slice, and before the grown-ups were properly started on their hors d'oeuvres, Julia fell into a coma in Sheila's arms.
At dinner's end, I slung my unconscious daughter over my shoulder and carted her off to a room in the Sheraton Waikiki -- where, a very few hours later, I was awakened by her announcement that it was "a beautiful morning." It wasn't beautiful. It wasn't morning. In the crepuscular light, well short of dawn, Julia was out on the balcony, already dressed in hula skirt and lei, watching pale explosions of surf on the black beach.
In 54 years of active fantasy life, I had never imagined that I might find myself on Waikiki Beach, at 7 A.M., in a thin and chilly drizzle, helping to dig burrows for nonexistent rabbits. Unsurprisingly, Julia and I had the place
to ourselves.
"It's raining," I said reproachfully. "Just like Seattle."
"It isn't!" Julia was leaping to Hawaii's defense. "It's hot rain. Hawaii is always hot because it's closer to the sun."
"I wish I'd never told you that."
It was 9 A.M. before I persuaded her to hit the Rice Krispies.
Back at the airport, we found our flight to Lanai was delayed. Julia, unflappable and uncomplaining, crawled with her favorite bear into the space below the twin rows of back-to-back seats and took a nap. When the Dash 8 eventually began its sprint down the runway, she was enthralled by the takeoff, the sudden release from earth, the diminishing -- and now sunlit -- city. "We're higher even than the palm trees!"
But the weather worsened as we flew south over an increasingly sullen-looking sea. We came down low over a rocky shoreline, rimmed with white, no more tropical in its appearance than the Isle of Man. The landing gear plopped down, and we were almost on the ground, when, with an abrupt snarl, the plane climbed steeply and Lanai faded out as we lurched, bumping, through the clouds. The pilot's voice came over the intercom: he was going to make a second attempt to land at Lanai, but if the visibility defeated him again, we'd have to go on to Maui.
"I'm not scared anymore," Julia said, as we twisted and bounced through lumpy fog. "I like it now." I didn't. I held her hand, for my own comfort more than for hers. Red dirt materialized out of nowhere just beneath us, then the shuddering thump of the wheels on tarmac, and the voice of the pilot, rather too plainly registering his own adrenaline level, saying, "Welcome to Lanai." His passengers applauded him. Julia clapped the longest.
From the hotel bus, Lanai was unexpectedly forbidding. Patches of tawny rock showed through the mesquite scrub to which the abandoned pineapple fields were fast returning. Red mud sluiced along the roadsides. We passed by the outskirts of Lanai City, a meager grid of dripping tin-roofed bungalows with tangled yards. "Are we still in Hawaii?" Julia asked. But as the bus started to corkscrew down the steep road to Manele Bay, the rain stopped and there was a smear, at least, of sunshine on the gale-torn sea ahead.
All Julia's doubts fled when we stopped at the hotel, where a uniformed bell captain hung yet another lei round her neck -- to which I added the lei he tried to drape on me. Bowed down by flowers and hugely, shyly grinning, Julia entered her paradise on earth.
Paradise -- in the shape of the Manele Bay Hotel -- is where the taste of Ralph Lauren collides with that of the Tang dynasty: it has something of the English country house, something of the Venetian Lido and enough ostentatious chinoiserie to fill a container ship end to end. From the grand public rooms at the center of this marvelous confection, one is led out to a mass of beige-colored open cloisters, through gardens packed with jasmine, palms, bougainvillea, orchids, jacaranda, where a winding stream, full of ornamental carp, is fed by a succession of prettily constructed waterfalls. In Xanadu ...
The hotel's preferred term for its own architectural style is "Mediterranean" -- but that's too modest. It is, rather, triumphantly American in its lavish capital investment, American in its lofty disregard for natural obstacles. The southern, leeward shore of Lanai is dry to the point of being arid; left to itself, it was a rust-colored cinder heap, nearly bereft of vegetation. When David H. Murdock, the Californian chairman and chief executive of Castle & Cook Homes and the Dole Food Company, the Kubla Khan of Lanai, took the island out of pineapples and into upmarket tourism, he built a new landscape with imported dirt, moistened by water piped down from the wet, forested uplands beyond Lanai City. The place is -- in the 18th-century sense of the word -- a folly; a monument to the wily artifice of the hydraulic engineer and landscape gardener. In the can-do arrogance of its conception, it's in the spirit of Las Vegas or the Grand Coulee Dam.
Our room lay at the far end of the maze; backed by a waterfall, fronted by a lawn, a ha-ha, then the sea. Julia was enchanted -- by the green at our doorstep ("We've got our own field!"), by the marbled splendor of the bathroom and its fittings, by the expensive collection of Chinese breakables. She expertly raided the minibar, changed into her bikini and went visiting with the neighbors along the row of oceanfront patios.
She was instantly at home here. What I hadn't realized was how very closely the world of the resort hotel resembles that of the preschool. The young women who run the concierge desk are the controlling grown-ups; they set the curriculum and sort out squabbles. The indignant 55-year-old guest, in his beach romperwear, with bulging face and shrilling voice, is pure 200-pound toddler in a snit.
As at preschool, the hotel day is organized around mealtimes, with, between meals, what Julia's Seattle school calls "sensory activities," centered on the pool, the spa and the beach. For the adult guest, the trick is to adjust to being 4 years old again. You have to learn the school rules: No swimwear in the public rooms ... elegant resort attire is acceptable in the restaurant ... You have to slot yourself into the regimented spaces of the school day. I settled for the activities known to Julia as Quiet Time and Stories -- lounging on our patio reading Trollope's "Bertrams" and trying to put names to the neighborhood birds.
The birds, as it turned out, exactly mirrored the human sociology of the islands. Very few were native to Hawaii. Most had been introduced within the last 150 years -- foreigners that had thrived in the balmy climate with its easy pickings, just like the Chinese, the Scots, the Filipinos, the American mainlanders, the Samoans. So the starlings, which roosted noisily each evening in the palms above our waterfall, had come from Britain by way of New York; the house sparrows had come over from New Zealand; the black-hooded mynahs from India, and the cardinals from the United States. The many Japanese guests at the hotel could wake to the familiar dawn chorus of Japanese bush warblers, resident aliens in Hawaii since 1929. Lanai was an island of immigrants, more Filipino than Hawaiian native; a cultural salad of exotic birds and people. The imported bric-a-brac in our room, the German family from Munich staying two doors down, Julia's and my own presence here -- we were all authentically part of the salad.
Meanwhile Julia, in the care of the Children's Activity Center ("Let's pretend I'm going to school in Hawaii"), was conducting a strenuous social life on her own behalf: she played bingo, went on epic scavenger hunts, watched movies, attended poolside pizza parties and fell in love with her swimming instructor.
I was walking to lunch, "The Bertrams" in hand, when I was hailed from the pool. "Daddy!" Julia, in rainbow bikini, was wetly reclining in the arms of a youthful, mahogany-tanned beach god. "This," she said, glowing with pride in her conquest, "is Kenji." "Hi, Kenji," I said, reaching down with the fake bonhomie that, I guess, all fathers learn to exercise in this situation. Kenji, with Julia riding on his back, lapped the pool.
"I shall not forget this day in my entire life," said Julia.
Next morning, she awakened at 6:45, sitting bolt upright in her bed and announcing, "I love Kenji."
"I know," I said. "Go back to sleep."
Paul and Sheila were due to join us on Friday. But I woke that morning to the brushfire crackle of rain on the patio: our ocean view had gone, and from the radio I learned that Lanai airport was closed to all traffic.
An intense kona storm was dawdling through the islands. Gleaming rods of rain were drilling holes in the lawn, and the dry creek bed just to the west of us (the favored haunt of the Japanese bush warbler) had become a foaming torrent of red water. It was tearing up small trees by the roots and flinging them into the ocean. The waterfalls were running red and so was the ornamental stream, which had burst its banks. The hybrid carp were nowhere to be seen. "Poor fish -- I expect they're dead," said Julia. Our usual elevator was out of order: it had sprung a leak and red water was dripping through the shaft. At the top of the stairs, six maids were trying to staunch the flood by pushing at it with long brooms. I rolled up my trouser legs, hoisted Julia onto my shoulders and paddled the last 20 yards to the main body of the hotel. A brief lull in the rain revealed that the sea itself was stained red with runoff: a half-mile-wide band of water, the color of dark tomato soup, now encircled the island.
We were marooned in our stately pleasure dome. Bands of would-be travelers were begging the concierge staff to make planes fly. The lobby was piled high with their luggage. "I have to be in New York tonight!" "I have to be in Tokyo tomorrow!" The only way off the island was by boat to Maui. "But it's rough, and I get seasick!" wailed a toddler in her 60's.
Things were quieter below. Couples were bent over million-piece jigsaw puzzles. Single men were making tents of two-day-old copies of The Wall Street Journal. There were novels -- John Grisham or Danielle Steel, depending on the reader's sex. People stared out into the gray yonder, then consulted their watches importantly, as if they expected their bomb to go off at any moment.
With Julia dispatched to the children's center, I finished "The Bertrams" and went off to browse through the hotel library, where I encountered my daughter, who was on a scavenger hunt. "Have you seen Kenji?" she said.
Getting through to Honolulu on the phone was like trying to raise Bora Bora or Uttar Pradesh: Paul's voice was a whispery vibration in the wires. "Tomorrow!" it croaked, from another world.
So I got Julia as my dinner date. For my entertainment she juggled with the silverware. She conducted a physics experiment involving the horizontal flow of liquids (apple juice, in this case, and the experiment failed). She slid under the table. She waved at strangers and kept up a running commentary on their varying degrees of baldness, redness of face, girth, age and fashion-victimhood.
The staff -- pineapple pickers, retrained for the hotel trade -- extended to both of us a smiling tolerance that went way beyond the call of duty. They indulged Julia; they talked to me of their children and grandchildren. Unaffected, with none of the solemn snootiness that tends to go with jobs at a $400-a-night hotel, these cheerful and elastic islanders seemed the best possible advertisement for David Murdock's economic revolution.
On Saturday morning, it was still raining, with the cloud-ceiling pegged to the ground. The weather system had stalled over Lanai and showed no sign of budging. No flights in or out. No Paul and Sheila. Our long-planned weekend was a bust. Julia splashed through the cloisters, clutching a fallen coconut that she'd found in the grass. She took in the thrashing palms, the rusty flood, the glum adults staring at the weather from their dripping patios. "I love Hawaii," she said. She had an appointment with Kenji at the children's center.
I pride myself on meeting the ordinary happenstances of traveling with equanimity, but Julia was making me feel a rank amateur. "So do I," I said. We passed the concierge desks, with their throng of grown-ups throwing tantrums. Julia marched through them, full of happy purpose, while I bumbled in her wake. She was in command of the vacation now: she had the Manele Bay world at her fingertips. "Come on! This way!" And I obeyed -- glad to learn, at this late stage, how to travel gracefully from my daughter.

HEADLINE: A New Latin Voice in the World of Pop

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Ostensibly it was a trade conference, but given the nature of the industry involved, it couldn't help turning into a huge party as well.
From the ample Jackie Gleason Theater in Miami Beach to back-street clubs in the the region's sprawling Cuban neighborhoods, Latin and Caribbean musicians from across the hemisphere converged here last week in a mood of artistic and economic euphoria. 
 At the Gleason Theater, the Colombian heartthrob and former soap opera star Carlos Vives wedded the country rhythms, wood flute and accordion of the raucus vallenata style with international pop.
At a party at Vizcaya, the waterside Italianate mansion, Chichi Peralta and Son Familia, from the Dominican Republic, mixed salsa, South African music, classical music, folk music, merengue and half a dozen other forms.
Control Machete, a new rap band from Monterrey, Mexico, that is one of the week's most talked-about groups, absorbed rap and skateboard cultures, and brought them together with the fluorescence of Mexican slang.
The occasion was the first Latin and Caribbean music conference sponsored by a French company called Midem, which sponsors commercial music trade events around the world. The gathering, known as Midem Music Mart '97, attracted 151 acts from 25 countries, filling the Miami Beach Convention Center with hundreds of booths from record companies, CD manufacturers, radio stations and concert promoters.
Past Midem Music Marts have taken place in Cannes, France, and Hong Kong. This was the first devoted to Latin music, and it came at a felicitous time. The Recording Industry Association of America recently reported that sales of Latin music were growing robustly while sales in other music segments were flat or slumping.
At the conference, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization that presents the Grammy Awards, announced that a parallel organization it had set up for Latin music would put on its own awards ceremony within 18 months.
Julio Iglesias, who gave a short speech at the conference, said he marveled at the growth of what had traditionally been a marginalized music niche. "I'm really proud of all the attention music in Spanish is finally getting," he said. "And it's been hard to get it, too. We've all worked hard to take the music around the world."
The one politically touchy note was a resolution by the Dade County government that restricts the county from doing business with companies involved in commerce with Cuba. The resolution nearly led to the cancellation of the conference, and some of the conference's promoters said it threatened its return. No music sponsored by Cuban companies was sold or performed at the conference.
The musical message of the week was evident in the syntheses of music across Latin cultures and countries.
Sometime early Wednesday morning, as night was pushing into dawn, Machel Montano from Trinidad hit the stage in Miami Beach with a mix of soca with reggae and hip-hop. The musicians take their cues from MTV.
For Control Machete, the Mexican rap group, hip-hop appropriations were ample, but the musical fusion was clearly Mexican; the form was borrowed, but the sensibility, the color of the music, was indigenous.
"We've heard hip-hop all our lives," said Fermin IV, one of the group's rappers. "Two Live Crew, House of Pain, everything. So we use hip-hop beats, but it's with our experience and we feel that its very, very Mexican."
The name that was perhaps mentioned most often was Ricky Martin. Mr. Martin, from Puerto Rico, was in the group Menudo and has acted on Broadway. He has had a major string of hits in Europe over the last year, from Spain to Finland. There was a sense here that Europe and the United States were primed for a portion of all the new experiments coming from Latin America and the Caribbean.
Wendy-Ann Garcia of the Trinidad and Tobago Tourism and Industrial Development Department, which sent 34 acts, said she thought her government's investment made sense.
"We feel that the world market right now is really receptive to Caribbean music," she said. "It's happy music, and there's so much going on now, from steel band orchestras to chutney music, which is a mixture of soca and eastern Indian music, that it is vibrant. Also, soca hasn't really broken out in Europe or in the United States. It still sounds new and fresh."
Roald Smeets, a Dutch businessman who started his record company Caiman a few years ago in the Caiman Islands, and who records Mr. Peralta, the Dominican band leader, invested nearly $50,000 in the trip.
Mr. Smeets said he thought the conference was catching Latin music at a ripe time. "In Holland, salsa and merengue are very big," he said. "Every town has a salsa dance class or a club. The average person no longer wants to just be a Dutch housewife or a banker. They want something better, something more social, and this music is a way to get into a different way of living."
None of this made too much difference to the musicians, who went on doing what they do: playing and hanging out.
Disk jockeys playing international and Latin mixes worked with Spanish-language rappers. Reggae, one of the most influential forms across Latin America, was in evidence all over. Puerto Rican salsa bands were joined by Puerto Rican rock bands, as well as rock bands from Argentina and some from the United States who sang in Spanish.
"There's so much going on now, it's hard to make a case that any one music sums up the whole," said Xavier Roy, Midem's chief executive. "It's rich, both culturally and financially."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW;
Museum Tells a Tale of Resilience, Tuned to the Key of Life

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
At last, at long, long last, Battery Park City has acquired a soul. With today's opening of the Museum of Jewish Heritage -- A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, this 92-acre sliver of landfill at the southern tip of Manhattan finally joins New York City. The place moves beyond real estate development, beyond upscale shopping, beyond its well-intended but bleakly suburban, golf course conception of modern urban life.
The museum honors the resilience of Jewish life in the face of genocide. The story told by its exhibitions is thoughtful, nuanced and tuned to the key of life. It would be pleasant to report that the museum's building, designed by Kevin Roche, conveys a similarly modulated message. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The building is dignified, somber and refined. It is a triumph of prestige design. But it is not a work of art. The architect has not explored his medium's potential either to arouse empathy or to express ideas. 
 The building occupies one of the most privileged sites in the world, overlooking New York Harbor with its dazzling reflected lights, views of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, and a horizon that is a virtual inscription to freedom. And Battery Park City's waterfront esplanade has endowed the museum with the most impressive approach of any cultural institution in New York City.
Mr. Roche's design is chiefly confined to the building's exterior. Apart from the handsome lobby and a top-floor gallery that commands breathtaking harbor views, the interiors were planned by Patrick Gallagher of Douglas/Gallagher, a firm based in Texas and Washington. Mr. Roche's task, essentially, was to create a distinctive urban object. His design has the virtue of simplicity. Sheathed in light granite, the three-story structure is hexagonal. Rows of square windows punctuate the walls. The roof is a ziggurat of concrete louvers. A deep rectangular reveal frames monumental entrance doors of bronze.
It is an understatement to say the building suffers from the defects of its virtues. Mr. Roche's design conveys none of the brilliant complexity displayed inside. The museum presents the staggering tapestry of life interwoven with death. The building resembles nothing so much as a mausoleum.
Victor Frankl, the psychotherapist, died two weeks before the opening of the Museum of Jewish Heritage. Author of the classic book "Man's Search for Meaning," Dr. Frankl founded a practice he called logotherapy, based on his own experience as a survivor of a Nazi death camp. Mental health, Dr. Frankl argued, is contingent on our power to invest events with meaning. Politics, art, love, family and religious faith may support this power, but what if the supports collapse?
In addition to everything else, the Holocaust was a crisis of meaning, a calamitous cognitive breakdown. What people knew -- that Jews were being herded on to boxcars, in full and often thunderously approving public view -- overwhelmed what they were able to believe: that a catastrophe of such magnitude was actually taking place before the eyes of the civilized world. Walter Laqueur, in his book "The Terrible Secret," analyzed the same disjunction from a historians perspective.
The genius of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, designed by James Ingo Freed, is that it gives full expression to the shattered relationship between knowledge and belief. The building depicts two faces of the German state, joined in a complicity of denial. The exterior props up, but barely, the thin facade of civilization. It is handsomely classical, durably stone. Within, Freed develops a vocabulary abstracted from watchtowers, oven doors, the bridges that connected Jewish ghettoes, isolating Jews from contact with the master race.
Mr. Freed invested these forms with meaning, but beyond that, he personally struggled with the whole issue of meaning in architectural form. Before this building, Mr. Freed was known for buildings like the Javits Convention Center, projects in which meaning was confined to the purely architectural values of structure, space, and light. In Washington, he challenged himself to reckon with ideas outside his usual frame of reference. That struggle is the ultimate source of the building's power. The building represents one architect's attempt to bridge the gulf between knowledge and belief. That effort changed the art of architecture itself.
No such struggle is evident in Kevin Mr. Roche's design. What we get, instead, is a subdued recycling of earlier Roche projects: the Lehman Pavilion at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the louvered roof of the office tower at 60 Wall Street.
Mr. Roche is not entirely to blame for the weakness of this building. Part of the problem stems from its location. Conceived in 1979, after years of many discarded plans, Battery Park City was the first major demonstration of the idea that New York City's future would be shaped by economic partnership between government and private enterprise. The demonstration produced a series of spaces that are neither public nor private.
The Winter Garden at the World Financial Center is a bogus public space, a shopping mall atrium with expensively wilting palms. Hudson Park is a bogus playground, a theme park furnished with architecturally insignificant pavilions. The residential buildings, with facades modeled after prewar architecture, are high-rise deceptions. Behind the facades are matchbox apartments that fall ridiculously short of prewar dimensions.
This place also represents a crisis of meaning. A veneer of tradition masks the collapse of a far more vital tradition: New York's belief in itself as the creative heart of cultural innovation. The sad truth is that Battery Park City is itself a memorial: a post-modern shrine to a New York that never was. This is not the ideal context for a building that seeks to memorialize the most catastrophic event in modern history,
New York has struggled for 50 years to build a memorial to the Holocaust. And that goal has now been brilliantly realized. Regrettably, the building that houses the museum fails to wrap itself around the intelligence displayed inside.

HEADLINE: John Leddy, 83, Senior Official Faced McCarthy

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

 BODY:
John Marshall Leddy, a former senior official of the State and Treasury Departments whose Government career was interrupted by a confrontation with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in 1953, died on Aug. 31 at Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax, Va. He was 83.
Mr. Leddy retired from the State Department in 1969 after serving in a succession of Government posts handling trade and international economic affairs. 
 He served as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs from 1965 to 1969; Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development from 1963 to 1965, and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs from 1961 to 1963.
He began his career in public service in 1937 as an officer in the Pan-American Union's economic information division.
For a time in the early 1950's, it appeared that Mr. Leddy's career would be cut short by Senator McCarthy's hunt for communists in the State Department, said Mr. Leddy's son, Thomas Leddy of Vienna, Va.
"Senator McCarthy was on a rampage, accusing everyone at the State Department of being a member of the Communist Party," recalled Thomas Leddy, a policy executive at the International Monetary Fund. "My father had proposed liberalizing trade toward Eastern Europe, which particularly raised his ire. Pop got out of town for a couple of years and then came back."
John Leddy conducted research at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University for several years, then returned to the State Department in the late 50's as a special assistant to Deputy Undersecretary C. Douglas Dillon.
While serving as Assistant Secretary of State in 1966, Mr. Leddy received a Rockefeller Public Service Award for more than 20 years of service in public affairs.
After his retirement, he served as a consultant to the Atlantic Council, producing a study on reform of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1975.
Mr. Leddy was married for 43 years to Louise Crawford of Nashville; she died in 1978. In addition to his son, he is survived by his second wife, Margaret Hardy Potter, also a former State Department trade official, whom he married in 1983, and two granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Statistics and Even Lore Of the Dismal Science

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Should you wake up in the middle of the night wondering whether Americans or Norwegians have a bigger per-capita gross domestic product, there is no need to lose sleep. You can find the answer, quickly and free, on the World Wide Web.
A rapidly proliferating number of Web sites are filled with economic statistics on everything from the latest official estimate of inflation by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to details of the Turkish budget. 
 Other sites let you manipulate data, such as easy-to-use sites that adjust dollars for inflation.
Economic Web sites can be valuable to businesses that are trying to decide on new investments or marketing, to students, and to anyone who needs answers to questions like how many Americans use wheelchairs (answer: 1.4 million) and the percentage of residents of every county who are children between the ages of 5 and 17.
Perhaps the most comprehensive site is Resources for Economists on the Internet, created by Bill Goffe, a University of Southern Mississippi economist, who has found enough links to fill 24 screens.
Most of these sites are easy to use, even by those who never took Economics 101 and do not care what price elasticity means.
You can find out how much the Federal Government spends per capita in every county, which turns up some curious figures. For example, the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, represents two Georgia counties where Federal spending is more than $7,000 per person, while Federal per-capita spending is less than half that level in two Missouri counties represented by Richard A. Gephardt, the House's Democratic minority leader.
The White House Economic Statistics Briefing Room has pages of color charts, some of them backed up by tables on income, crude oil, farm prices and household wealth. But the site's creators have a curious lack of consistency about chronology. You can trace poverty rates back to 1959, but median household income data to 1970 and disposable personal income only to January 1995.
At the site maintained by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which posts comparative statistics from 25 advanced nations, you can answer the question about whether Americans or Norwegians are better off. The answer, as of the last time the Web site was updated, is both. Norwegians are 26 percent better off than Americans based on currency-exchange rates. On the other hand, in terms of purchasing power, Norwegians have only 85 percent as much as Americans.
Ever wonder what would happen if gasoline prices doubled, Pentagon spending was cut by a third or a flat 27 percent income tax was adopted? You can find out using Fairmodel, a model of the United States economy created by Ray C. Fair, a Yale University professor. The model is easy enough that social studies students use it during their nine weeks of economics instruction at Palatine High School outside Chicago. Advanced students manipulate the model on their own, while lower-level students sit around as their teacher, Robert Gilbert, punches in their proposed changes to fiscal and monetary policies.
"Instead of hearing a lot of theory, my students actually put their hands on the valves of the economy," Mr. Gilbert said. "And it turns out to be a great tool for building self esteem because I have them work with a 20-year period; they just don't know what the period was because I remove the years, and their decisions usually produce better results than the actual results of what Presidents and the Congress did."
There are even sites with a touch of whimsy, like Ken White's coin-flipping page, where with the stroke of a key you can demonstrate what happens if you flip 100 dimes (heads American, tails Canadian).
And one site is filled with jokes about the dismal science created by Pasi Petteri Kuoppamki, a research fellow at the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry, with a United States mirror site for faster downloading.
Among its jokes is this one, edited to its essence from the shaggy-dog version on the Web:
A man comes upon a shepherd and his flock, and proposes a wager.
"I will bet you $100, against one of your sheep, that I can tell you the exact number in this flock," the man says.
The shepherd accepts.
"973," says the man.
The shepherd, astonished at the accuracy, says "I'm a man of my word; take an animal."
The man picks one up and begins to walk away.
"Wait," cries the shepherd, "Let me have a chance to get even. Double or nothing that I can guess your exact occupation."
"Sure," the man replies.
"You are an economist for a government think tank," says the shepherd.
"Amazing!" responds the man, "How did you deduce that?"
"Well," says the shepherd, "if you will first put down my dog . . ."

RUTH W. MESSINGER
 
Speaking to reporters yesterday after an Eastern Queens Democratic Club breakfast in Oakland Gardens, in response to a question about the fairness of criticizing the Rev. Al Sharpton during the mayoral race: 

"Everything about an individual candidate for office, or just about everything, is fair game. I have made clear my disagreements with Al Sharpton on matters of policy and matters of principle. I have done it before the campaign heated up, I have done it pretty steadily through the campaign, and obviously I will do it during the runoff. But my focus is going to continue to be on the fact that this city has big problems. And if we don't identify those problems and talk about them and outline solutions, then we are not running an election, we're running a debating society. "
 
AL SHARPTON
 
In a wide-ranging interview yesterday on the "Open Line" talk show on KISS-FM, he made the case that he was the strongest Democratic candidate for mayor, and that he could beat the incumbent:
 
" Let us remember we are in a city that has over a 10 percent unemployment rate. Young people are going to school tomorrow in schools that are in disrepair. Their classrooms are overcrowded and 53 percent of them can't read at their grade level. We're in a city where police brutality is still rampant. There is no systemic change and Abner Louima still lays in a Brooklyn hospital. "

HEADLINE: A Feisty Weld Criticizes Helms For His Stance on Mexico Post

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
William F. Weld today used his fight to become Ambassador to Mexico to articulate his vision of the Republican Party and to portray Jesse Helms, the conservative Senator who has denied him a hearing, as an undesirable representative of the party.
In a feisty appearance on the NBC News program "Meet The Press," Mr. Weld, a moderate Republican and social libertarian, said his only hope to become ambassador was if public outrage at Mr. Helms forced a Senate hearing on his nomination. 
 "I think this battle is now in the court of public opinion," Mr. Weld said.
He took swipes at Mr. Helms and Washington, persisted in the kind of comments that even his supporters have called undiplomatic and hedged when asked if he would run for President in 2000.
At the same time, Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, reaffirmed that he thought Mr. Weld's chances for a hearing were zero.
White House officials had little new to say about this political serial, except that Mr. Weld had not discussed with them the possibility of withdrawing his nomination. They said that President Clinton would continue to advocate on his behalf but that he would navigate carefully away from criticizing Mr. Helms and Mr. Lott.
The Administration seems content to leave Mr. Weld to his own strategy, which he discussed with White House officials this morning.
Mr. Weld appeared today to hold out little practical hope that the Senate would give him a hearing. He said his best chance would be for the public to rise up in anger at Mr. Helms, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Helms, who has said Mr. Weld was soft on drugs and would be an inappropriate ambassador to a country with as serious a drug problem as Mexico's, said he would maintain his prerogatives as chairman and not grant Mr. Weld a hearing.
With a nod to the definitiveness of Mr. Helms's opposition and the unlikelihood that Mr. Lott would circumvent Mr. Helms, Mr. Weld said today: "There are 100 senators. If they hear from people out there on Main Street, I think that's what's going to change the dynamic here."
Mr. Weld's tone and comments suggested that he believed he had little to lose, as far as winning the nomination was concerned, by portraying himself as his own man, not a diplomatic conciliator (although he said if he were Ambassador he would advocate the President's views, not his own).
Mr. Weld, the former Governor of Massachusetts, also took the opportunity to lay out his view of Republicanism as the party continues its internal strife, particularly over social issues. Mr. Weld noted he favored abortion rights. He referred to his protection of "fundamental Republican principles of economic development but keeping the Government out of people's face, having a maximization of individual liberty."
He gave the air of being engaged in a larger political mission, trying to appeal to moderates who see Mr. Helms as the icon of conservatism in the way that conservatives see Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts as the icon of liberalism.
In calling for voters' support, he said Mr. Helms, whom he opposes on most social issues, had become "the face of the national Republican Party." And while he said he would not run for the Senate in 2000, he hedged when asked whether he would run for President.
"No, my sights are set on Mexico City," he replied, then added, "I'll take my battles one at a time." Asked again, he said: "I'm not going to bid against myself in terms of what might happen in the future."
Mr. Weld has fueled such speculation since the fight over his nomination began in the spring. Attacking Washington as he has at times previously, he portrayed himself as an outsider challenging the kind of inside-the-Beltway maneuvering that has disgusted many voters.
Mr. Lott, on the CBS News program "Face The Nation," said Mr. Weld has "behaved really outrageously," and he seemed increasingly impatient with the Clinton Administration for the "mischief" of nominating Mr. Weld when President Clinton knew he would encounter resistance on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Christian Coalition Reaffirms Its Strength

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 14

 BODY:
It appeared to be another joyous weekend of prayer and politics here at the Christian Coalition's annual convention. But between their familiar fulminations against abortion, homosexuals and President Clinton, many speakers left little doubt they fear that the group could lose some of its political punch.
In speech after speech, leaders of the largest organization of religious conservatives signaled their concerns by defiantly, even defensively, insisting that the Christian Coalition was not about to fade. 
 "America, we are still here," declared Donald P. Hodel, the group's new president, "and we are going to be here for years to come."
Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who founded the organization eight years ago, told the crowd, "We have not lost our vision -- we haven't wavered in our faith." Even as the coalition has struggled with little success to expand its membership to minorities and Catholics, he confidently predicted, "We can double everything that we have been doing in the next five years. We want to double our budget. We want to double our grass-roots infrastructure."
The heartening news for the coalition this weekend was that it still managed to attract a cavalcade of Republican luminaries, including seven prospective Presidential candidates who are mindful of the group's effectiveness at turning out voters on Election Day.
But many of the 1,000 coalition members who gathered here conceded in interviews that their organization was embarking on a new, perhaps arduous, journey: Most notably, its charismatic executive director, Ralph Reed, who has been credited with the organization's success, has left to become a political consultant.
Mr. Reed's departure came as the organization's activities face serious scrutiny from Federal officials. Among the inquiries, the Federal Election Commission is investigating whether the coalition made illegal efforts to promote Republican candidates, and the Internal Revenue Service is examining whether the group's actions violated its tax-exempt status.
These inquiries pose serious challenges for the pair that Mr. Robertson, the chairman, selected in June to replace Mr. Reed: Mr. Hodel, a former Secretary of the Interior and Randy Tate, a former one-term Congressman from Washington state, who is the executive director.
Thus far, the new leadership has kept a low profile in the capital; Mr. Tate and Mr. Hodel did not announce their legislative priorities until they had been on the job for three months. (The group's Capitol Hill agenda includes pressing to establish a White House office to monitor religious persecution; elimination of the so-called marriage penalty that can mean higher taxes for some couples, and support for tax-free savings accounts for parents of children in private or public schools.)
The coalition also faces competition from Gary Bauer, an influential conservative who heads the Family Research Council and established his own political action committee earlier this year. Mr. Bauer represents a significant number of outspoken conservatives who believe that Mr. Reed was too much the pragmatist in making deals with Republicans in Congress and straying from an agenda of strictly social issues.
"A steady drumbeat of criticism of the Christian Coalition -- that maybe their day has finally passed -- has stung its leaders and made them want to argue the counter case," said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who is an authority on religious conservatives. "I don't think they worry about disappearing, but they worry about being able to continue to grow."
By holding the convention outside Washington for the first time in five years and by cutting the traditional length of the program almost by half, some convention organizers said the new team was trying to stay out of the spotlight as it regrouped.
Still, for all of its looming troubles, the lineup of speakers demonstrated that the Christian Coalition still has drawing power. The least subtle of the prospective wannabees for 2000 was Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, who held an ice cream social and personally concocted vanilla-and-Coke floats for dozens of participants. When he addressed the crowd Saturday, he was greeted by a mock spontaneous demonstration of supporters planted on the floor of the hall who brandished placards with messages like, "Run John Run" and "Ashcroft for President."
"Janet and I seek your prayers in the months ahead as we consider pursuit of the nation's highest office," Mr. Ashcroft said. "We want your prayers that our decision-making process will reflect the spirit of Christ."
As usual, Alan Keyes, the radio-show host who ran for the Republican nomination last year, was the favorite of many delegates with his fiery flourishes like, "Stop killing the babies!"
But Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who is preparing to run for President again, made a special effort to win over the crowd by emphasizing abortion and other social issues that he shunned in 1996. In return, Mr. Forbes drew one of the most raucous, foot-stomping receptions of the weekend.
Mr. Forbes was one of several speakers who condemned not only the Clinton Administration but the Republican leadership in Congress for being "neck deep in compromise, captive to its doubts -- in search of its soul." Still, Speaker Newt Gingrich won applause for saying that the budget agreement passed by Congress demonstrated public support for a conservative agenda.
Yet many speakers stuck to the moral themes that have been central to the coalition's agenda. Oliver L. North, a central figure in the Iran-contra affair who later became a talk-radio host, mocked James Carville, Mr. Clinton's chief strategist in 1992, as "James Car-vile."
"It's not the economy, stupid!" Mr. North said of the consultant's near legendary mantra for the Clinton campaign. "It's the morality, stupid!"
Gov. David M. Beasley of South Carolina delivered a long speech about the perils of divorce and ticked off many statistics, as well as this contention: "Studies will show monogamous married couples to be the most sexually satisfied people in America."
And one of Mr. Robertson's bigger applause lines came when he called for "an America where families are valued and children are cared for by two married, heterosexual parents."
Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a group that attacks the Christian Coalition, said that despite the ruminations over the leadership shift, Mr. Robertson was still clearly in command. "I think you could literally appoint to the Christian Coalition's board of directors Jesus, Moses and Mohammed," he said, "and Pat Robertson would still call the shots."

Wage Gap Widens Again Between Men and Women
After nearly two decades in which the wage gap between men and women narrowed steadily, it is now widening again. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of full-time working women are just under 75 percent of the men's median, down from 77 percent four years ago. 
 While some economists suggest the gender gap may be connected to changes in the welfare laws unleashing a flood of unskilled women on the job market, most warn that it is far too soon to say what the data portend. [A1.]
 
Computers Eroding Privacy

The nearly five-year investigation illustrates the world of computer technology and information marketing that has turned private detectives into a vanguard of privacy invasion. [A1.]

HEADLINE: North Korea Famine May Be Killing 15% in Towns, Survey Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
An informal survey conducted for Korean-American organizations has found that about 15 percent of people in North Korea's towns and villages may be dying of starvation and famine-related diseases, an official of the international relief organization World Vision said yesterday.
The North Korean Government was not informed of the survey, which was carried out by ethnic Koreans living on the Chinese side of the China-North Korea border who can travel freely into North Korea. About 400 North Koreans and some Chinese and Russian citizens who recently traveled to North Korea were questioned. 
 They told stories of unclaimed bodies being collected from village streets and coffins being reused to save wood.
The results of the survey are to be made public in New York today by Andrew Natsios, vice president of World Vision, which has relief programs in North Korea.
"Fifteen percent is a huge famine," Mr. Natsios said in a telephone interview yesterday from his home in Washington. "And the thing that's alarming is that those three provinces on the Chinese border where the survey was conducted are ones where the World Food Program has found that people are the best fed."
Mr. Natsios, a former head of United States Government relief programs during famine crises in Africa, said that if these figures are reflective of the national picture, as many as half a million North Koreans may have died of starvation and famine-related illnesses in a population of about 22 million.
"Based on other reports we are getting, these findings seem to be an accurate and not exaggerated description," Mr. Natsios said, adding that food shortages would peak in November, when there should be a fall harvest -- although its size is hard to predict -- and a chance to plant winter crops.
Mr. Natsios, who visited North Korea in June, said the famine's effects were being worsened by the collapse of the national transportation system, which makes distribution of what food there is difficult.
World Vision, one of a handful of American-based private relief organizations working in North Korea, is recommending that Washington press China and Japan to give the North Koreans more food aid. Those organizations are also asking the secretive North Korean Government to allow relief experts and reporters to travel freely in the country, especially to remote areas. "The North Korean Government must be pressed to open the country up so that we can judge its needs," Mr. Natsios said.
"It would be much easier to mobilize resources if they would give us more access," he added. He also recommended that food donations, which the North Koreans are seeking desperately, should come in through the eastern ports and the Chinese border rather than through the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.
"No more food should come through Pyongyang," he said, adding that too much of it is being held and consumed there.
The survey recently conducted along the Chinese-North Korean border covered more than 30 villages and towns in Hamgyong, Puongan and Ryanggang provinces, with the largest number of people surveyed living around the towns of Onsong and Musan in Hamyong.
Of 400 people initially interviewed by Chinese-Koreans, only 33 agreed to complete more detailed questionnaires about local conditions. The rest said they were too fearful of the North Korean Government to divulge information beyond descriptions of life in their own towns.
World Vision officials acknowledge that the survey was limited and often anecdotal, but welcomed its findings as "probably the first of its kind" for North Korea.
The isolated country suffered floods in 1995 and 1996 and a summerlong drought this year. The natural disasters hit an economy unable to function normally, much less in crisis, after years of a bizarre Communist experiment in self-sufficiency that left the country without hard currency to buy emergency supplies or even spare parts abroad.
The collapse of the Soviet bloc further weakened North Korea. Its closest friends now are Cuba and Vietnam, neither of which is able to give much assistance.

HEADLINE: Congo Aid at Risk In Defiance of U.N. Over War Refugees

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Four months after winning power through an armed rebellion, this country's new President, Laurent Kabila, is locked in a showdown with the United Nations. The outcome, diplomats say, could critically influence his Government's prospects for survival and will determine how it is seen by much of the world.
Mr. Kabila is torn between the demands of the international organizations and foreign governments that he respect long-established conventions on the treatment of refugees and the investigation of war atrocities, and the demands of powerful African allies who helped place him in power and have no interest in light being shed on these matters. Diplomats say that Mr. Kabila, militarily and politically weak, has opted to satisfy his neighbors. 
 A breakdown in relations with the United Nations would almost certainly spill over into Congo's ties with international financial institutions like the World Bank, and other lenders in the West.
A donors' conference in Paris last month put the new Government on notice that major loans to Congo will be contingent on human rights improvements and a real commitment to democratic elections.
Aid from Washington is already nearly frozen because of huge arrears in debt repayments inherited from the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko, who was overthrown by Mr. Kabila.
Even before it came to power, Mr. Kabila's movement won a number of commitments from international mining companies for large investments in copper and cobalt production here, but bankers here say little of that money is paid in advance to the new Government, whose revenue is to come from future production.
Returning this week from a brief visit to Rwanda, his biggest military backer during the seven-month war that defeated Mr. Mobutu and put Mr. Kabila in power last May, Congo's new leader gave full voice to the aggressive tack he has apparently decided to take toward the United Nations.
He spoke with undisguised scorn in responding to a warning by the United Nations refugee agency that it would suspend its work in this country because of the summary deportation this month of 700 Rwandans and Burundians, refugees from the city of Kisangani, in what the head of the refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, called a "blatant breach of international treaties."
"We should be very pleased about the departure of the people" of the refugee agency, Mr. Kabila said, "because they are harmful to freedom and well-being of the Congolese people. It would be a good opportunity for the Congolese people to be totally free."
One senior Congolese official later explained Mr. Kabila's language saying that the Government suspected an international conspiracy of sorts to use the refugee issue in the United Nations to destroy Mr. Kabila's Government and replace it with leaders more amenable to the West.
"The history of our country and the United Nations is the history of a failed romance," said Biyoya Makutu Kahandja, a senior Foreign Ministry official. "At independence in 1960 the United Nations banned our own Prime Minister from the radio, and a U.N. peacekeeping force took sides in our civil war. We have reasons to suspect the worst."
Mr. Kabila's Government has been even more assertive in its treatment of a United Nations-mandated investigation into the suspected massacre of thousands of predominantly Rwandan ethnic Hutu who were reportedly killed by Rwandan Tutsi forces during and after Mr. Kabila's campaign for power.
Some of the Rwandan Hutu are known to have been armed combatants, participants in the 1994 anti-Tutsi massacres in that country who allied themselves with Mr. Mobutu's army. But many thousands of the presumed victims were women and children.
After approving the deployment of the investigators under intense international pressure, Mr. Kabila's Government has thrown one obstacle after another in the way of the team, successfully demanding the removal of its original leader, questioning its mandate repeatedly and effectively preventing it from starting its work.
In a recent exchange of correspondence, Mr. Kabila wrote to the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, demanding that any investigation of atrocities be limited to eastern Congo, where the insurrection against Mr. Mobutu began, that it cover only the period before Mr. Kabila took power on May 17, and that investigators be accompanied by Congolese "facilitators."
Later, in what one United Nations official called a "clear provocation," Congolese officials submitted a budget for 24 official "facilitators" that included a $700 daily allowance for each. With the United Nations already considering withdrawing the investigators altogether and referring the matter to the Security Council for possible punitive action, Mr. Annan replied on Aug. 29 in a letter calling the new conditions a "complete surprise," and complained bitterly that "promises and assurances given are being reneged upon."
More recently, the United Nations investigators here have been told by their superiors in New York to try immediately to begin their field work, with the idea that if the Government obstructs them further the mission will simply be recalled.
One member of the investigative mission, Reed Brody, said that when the team tried to buy airplane tickets on Saturday for a destination within the country to begin their work, the travel agent here told them the Government had given instructions that no tickets could be sold to them.
If the investigators pull out, a move many here believe is imminent, Western diplomats say it will prompt a series of actions that will further isolate a Government with huge reconstruction needs, little cash and a dwindling number of friends.
Until now, Washington has been widely seen as the Kabila Government's most sympathetic backer outside of Africa, but senior American officials too have begun to say that enough is enough.
"We very much wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and to help him," said Bill Richardson, the American delegate to the United Nations. "But when it appears that his Government turns its back on important commitments made to the international community, he leaves us with few options."

HEADLINE: Another Waterway Is Closed in Maryland;
Thousands of Fish Die in Most Recent Outbreak of Microbe Problem

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: DRAWBRIDGE, Md., Sept. 14

 BODY:
Thousands of fish stricken with a microbial affliction thrashed weakly this morning on the surface of Chicamacomico River, leading the state to close yet another waterway to fishing and recreation and adding to the urgency of a festering new environmental problem for the Chesapeake Bay.
It was the third time since early August that Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland had ordered the closure of one of the bay's Eastern Shore tributaries, where sport and commercial fishermen and boaters prop up half the economy and chicken farms and cornfields sustain the other half. 
 The gaping raw sores on the four-inch-long menhaden, which are a common bait fish for crabbers in this area, are the classic symptom of fish attacked by Pfiesteria piscicida, a little-understood microbe discovered only a few years ago that sometimes assumes a toxic form. It has been blamed not only for killing fish but also for rashes, flulike symptoms and even short-term memory loss among some people who have come into contact with it while fishing or conducting research.
Just what causes Pfiesteria to turn toxic is not certain, but chronic problems with the microbe in North Carolina are thought by many scientists to be related to polluted runoff from hog farms. In this part of Maryland, the attention is focusing on chicken farms, whose manure enriches the cornfields that dominate the landscape, drained by ditches that feed directly into some of the affected streams. The nutrients in the manure runoff provide the nourishment for microbes to flourish.
Already, Governor Glendening has stirred a furor in the agricultural community by suggesting that chicken farmers should brace for stricter pollution standards. He said he would appoint a commission to develop recommendations this fall for better regulation of agricultural runoff.
In the meantime, the state's decisions to close a stretch of the Pocomoke River, a section of King's Creek and the Manokin River, and now six miles of the Chicamacomico, have stirred another kind of economic turmoil, because the fishing and tourism industries have paid the price. Pfiesteria hysteria, as it is being called, has dominated the front pages of many of the region's newspapers for weeks now.
"Our two primary concerns must be, first, the health of our citizens, and second, the health of the bay itself," Governor Glendening said in a telephone interview today. "In many ways, Maryland is the Chesapeake Bay, and if we can't find the source of this and contain it, we have the possibility of this spreading year after year."
Even before the state closed the river today, uniformed natural resources police warned boaters and passers-by to avoid the area.
"We're here to advise you it's probably not wise to hang around," one officer told Cindy and John Jacobs, who bicycled by with their son Dennis. They said they were visiting relatives in the area and had been planning to go fishing.
"It's terrible -- look how many there are," said Mrs. Jacobs, gazing at the sick fish from the bridge. "Isn't that sad?"
In their death throes, some of the fish leaped from the water; the dead ones floated downstream. It was impossible to say how many fish would die, but clearly tens of thousands had been stricken since the outbreak was detected late on Saturday. Teams of state officials have been taking samples and shipping them to laboratories for analysis. Until that work is done, it cannot be said for certain that Pfiesteria was at work.
Throughout the region, businesses that rely on tourism said they were suffering from the bad publicity.
Larry Knudsen, proprietor of the River House Inn, which abuts the Pocomoke several miles above the area that the state closed, said a group of elderly guests who visit every year, filling the inn, had canceled this year's trip. Because they usually eat at a fine local restaurant and take a boat tour, he said, the economic loss from their decision alone was probably thousands of dollars.
Many of the Eastern Shore's large poultry farmers say there is insufficient proof to pin the problem on their operations. But some farmers acknowledge that chicken manure may be partly to blame for the fish kills.
"I believe it is a contributing factor," said Frank Morison, a founder and director of the Delmarva Contract Poultry Growers Association, a group of 2,600 poultry farmers from Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. "I've been in the industry for 30 years and done a lot of research," he said. "Wherever the industry sets up shop, there's water quality problems associated with it."
Although many local residents suspect that the heavy output of chicken manure is somehow implicated in the fish disease outbreaks, they are often gentle in their criticism of their neighboring farmers.
"We have never pointed a finger at the poultry industry alone," said Fred Maddox of Maddox & Son Seafood in Shelltown, who began reporting sick fish to state authorities as long as a year ago.
Pollution-control experts point out that there are many sources of excess nutrients pouring into the Chesapeake, from well-fertilized suburban lawns to outmoded sewage treatment plants, and even from the nitrogen in air pollution throughout the vast watershed.
But Judith Stribling, an assistant professor of biology at Salisbury State University and a leader of Friends of the Nanticoke, another river where sick fish have been reported but not confirmed by state authorities, says agricultural runoff is a prime suspect. She suspects that there may be an imbalance between the nutrient chemicals nitrogen and phosphorus, especially when manure is used as fertilizer.
"We have been saying for years that the bay was overloaded with nutrients," she said. "The obvious question is: How much worse is this going to get, and how far is it going to go?"
Governor Glendening said he had called for a meeting of regional governors this week, and that Gov. George F. Allen of Virginia, who has drawn some criticism for his state's less aggressive response to Pfiesteria in its waters, would attend.
Environmental Protection Agency officials have said they are examining how to better control the runoff from agricultural sources nationwide. New regulations and tougher enforcement of rules governing animal feedlots are under active consideration, they said.

HEADLINE: Albright's Trip: No 'Big Steps'

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 14

 BODY:
As a measure of the deteriorating peace efforts in the Middle East, even the Davis Cup tennis team from Morocco -- one of the Arab countries warmest to Israel -- has refused to go to Israel to play.
While security fears were cited as the reason, American officials interpret the decision as a protest against the policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and an example of the increasing re-isolation of Israel in even the moderate Arab world. 
 In her first official visit to the Middle East, which is due to end on Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has found herself having to try to restore even the semblance of negotiations toward peace. She has had to try to reduce the swelling distaste and distrust between the conservative Mr. Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Mr. Arafat is still nostalgic for Israel's Labor Party, whose leaders negotiated and signed the Oslo accords with him on the White House lawn exactly four years ago.
Ms. Albright's delicate task has been to push a deeply divided Israel hard enough to convince it not to damage its own interests. And if Mr. Arafat or Mr. Netanyahu will not take up her challenge to make "hard decisions" needed to restart peace talks, she wants to protect American strategic interests in the larger Middle East from the collateral damage.
She had to warn Mr. Arafat that the United States -- let alone Israel -- would no longer tolerate his use of security cooperation with Israel as a negotiating lever.
She had to support Mr. Netanyahu in his security concerns. But she also had to warn him that they cannot forever be a pretext to keep from dealing seriously with the political issues of real peace and partnership -- or at the minimum, rapprochement -- with the Palestinians.
With the American-built regional coalition against Iran and Iraq fraying badly, Ms. Albright had to go to the Middle East to appear to be trying her best to work as an "honest broker" for peace and to be heard speaking with at least some sympathy for the situation as moderate Arabs and Palestinians see it.
A prolonged collapse of peace negotiations would lead to more radical and fundamentalist pressures on moderate Arab governments, the further isolation of Israel, the undermining of Mr. Arafat by a frustrated and impoverished Palestinian population, a probable increase in terrorism and violence, and a major fracture in the strategic position of the United States in the Middle East.
Ms. Albright had to begin to fix all that in the aftermath of a second suicide bombing episode in recent weeks, when the Israelis needed reassurance about their security. She also had to manage the entire initiative without getting President Clinton into too much trouble with a pro-Israel Congress and Democratic Party at home.
With so much at stake, it is really too early to say whether this much-postponed first trip to the region has been a success or a failure. She herself was relatively honest about the paucity of her achievement, but for once she may have been selling herself a little short.
While she made clear that "big steps" were needed -- from Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat, she was careful to say, not from the United States -- she did manage to arrange a series of meetings on both the Palestinian-Israel and Israel-Syrian negotiating tracks.
Neither is likely to go very far very fast, but they did break the sense of deterioration and stalemate and bought everybody some time. They helped to restore a sense of American engagement and sway. And she was outspoken about the damage done by unilateral Israeli actions like settlement expansion, while decrying the radical Arab terrorism that also threatens every Arab state.
These accomplishments alone produced complimentary sighs of relief from Arab leaders ranging from President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan to less predictable figures like King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the country's conservative Crown Prince, Abdullah.
Mr. Mubarak said her trip had produced unexpected results and had created new hope for peace efforts, telling her in their meeting that she was being seen "in a new light" throughout the Arab world. Crown Prince Abdullah, who has warned that Saudi Arabia might boycott an American-sponsored regional economic meeting in mid-November in Doha, Qatar, said, "This is what we always looked for and admired, a Secretary of State who is brave and frank at the same time."
Even taking into account traditional Arab chivalry -- King Fahd met her uncharacteristically early in the evening and did not keep her waiting -- Ms. Albright clearly made a favorable first impression.
The public relations-conscious Mr. Netanyahu, too, has moved quickly to make some gestures of the kind she recommended, announcing tonight that he would turn over half of the remaining money he owes the Palestinian Authority and canceling plans for a small but controversial housing project in Jerusalem that he had earlier suspended. And Mr. Arafat has already moved some way, though not nearly far enough, American officials say, to begin to crack down on the militant group Hamas.
The actions are another proof of an old diplomatic adage that when parties are engaged in negotiations, no matter how desultory, they tend to behave more responsibly.
There is a risk that those negotiations could quickly run into the sand, producing another stalemate and possibly further deterioration.
Still, it would be remarkable enough if both parties followed the path of "mutual responsibility" that Ms. Albright laid out for them on this trip -- Mr. Arafat producing enough security cooperation to give the Israelis enough confidence to make the political moves necessary to get into serious final-status talks, while carrying out what remains of the troop withdrawals from the West Bank called for under the Oslo accords.
Those final status talks themselves, to reach a peace settlement, must tackle the most fundamental issues between Israelis and Palestinians. The talks are to define the boundaries of the Palestinian entity, whether it becomes a state or not (and if so, what kind), and the future status of Jerusalem, which both peoples claim as their capital.
But just to get that far, from where matters are today, would be a significant accomplishment for a Secretary of State who waited eight months to visit the region in the vain hope of associating her first trip with a negotiating success.

HEADLINE: Women Losing Ground to Men In Widening Income Difference

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
After nearly two decades in which the wage gap between men and women was steadily narrowing, it is now widening again, piquing confusion and concern among economists and women's groups alike.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of full-time working women are just under 75 percent of the men's median, down from 77 percent four years ago. 
 "It's a puzzlement," said Francine Blau, a labor economist at Cornell University. "In my head, at this point, it doesn't mean we're actually going backward. It's more a slowdown, a plateau, a consolidation after a period of rapid social change. The concern is what's happened to that robust upward trend we had for so many years, and what's going to happen in the future."
From 1979 to 1993, women's median earnings rose from 62 percent of men's to 77 percent. And in the early 1990's, the narrowing gap was widely trumpeted as evidence of women's greater opportunities, greater education and greater work experience -- trends that were predicted to continue indefinitely, edging women ever closer to pay equity.
"The narrowing wage gap got a huge amount of attention five years ago," said Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University. "But right now, we're a little quiet. Questions of gender and economics are going to be with us forever, and it's all connected to political and social change. The social movements that led to women's advances came in with great force. It was an enormous tide. Now we're coming into a new equilibrium. I see this as a household issue, and the new equilibrium is that all those strollers are still being pushed by women."
While some labor economists suggest tentatively that the turn in the statistics may have something to do with a flood of unskilled women unleashed on the job market by changes in welfare, most warn that it is far too soon to say with any certainty just what, if anything, the earnings data portend.
"There's definitely something real going on, and it's worth worrying about, but we don't have a good explanation," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research organization known for liberal views. "I've been wanting to point out to the world that it was happening, but I didn't know why, and I wanted to have some causal information before writing about it."
Most experts caution against any conclusion that the earnings numbers are evidence of growing discrimination against women: They say it is more likely that the numbers reflect changes in the makeup of the workforce, overall economic trends, or statistical flukes, than any real reversal of women's workplace status.
They point out that while one measure of wages -- median usual weekly earnings of full-time workers -- shows a steadily widening gap between men and women since 1993, another measure available only through 1995 -- annual full-time wages of year-round workers -- fluctuates slightly, showing no steady trend. The gap between men's and women's annual earnings is larger than on the weekly earnings in part because the annual measure more fully reflects bonuses and occasional overtime, areas in which men tend to do better than women.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics changed its questionnaire in 1994, so that the later earnings data are not strictly comparable with the earlier years, but that would not account for any continuing drop.
Generally, the youngest working women have come closest to men's pay levels, with those age 16 to 24 earning more than 90 percent of men's wages, those in their mid-careers earning about 75 percent, and those over 55 earning about 65 percent as much as men their age.
"Looking at women over their life cycle, you see that as they get those first jobs, they look pretty equal to men, then when they have their first baby, they start looking less equal to men," Ms. Goldin said.
Though that overall picture remains unchanged, the youngest and oldest women lost ground in the last few years, while women ages 25 to 54 continued to earn about 75 percent of what men their age earned.
The effort to sort out just what the gender gap means is complicated, because it reflects larger economic trends. For example, economists point out, more women may choose to stay home with a new baby during a recession, when wages stagnate and job-hunting becomes harder.
"You're measuring one thing that's changing against another thing that's changing," said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. "Anywhere from half to three-quarters of the closing of the gender gap was a result of men's real wages falling, so women's wages came closer. Now men's wages are rising again, so to keep closing the gap, women's would have to be rising faster."
Ms. Hartmann is troubled by the widening wage gap because it indicates a concentration of women at the low end of the pay scale.
"There's a growing inequality in the labor market between people at the high end and people at the low end," she said. "Women are losing out because more of them are moving into the losing category of lower skilled workers than into the winning categories of highly skilled workers."
Economists at both ends of the political spectrum suggest that the change may be a result of welfare overhaul.
"Not-married women with children have had an enormous increase in employment, which coincides with the dropping welfare caseloads," said June O'Neill, the Republican-appointed head of the Congressional Budget Office. "These are the least skilled people entering the workforce, and that would have a downward pull on median wages."
Ms. O'Neill said that though she had not examined the data closely enough to offer any definitive analysis, she thought it was more likely that the earnings data reflected welfare changes than sex discrimination.
"Clinton was elected saying he would get rid of welfare as we know it," said Marvin Kosters, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington. "By 1994, we had a Republican Congress, and a lot of changes at the state level. The movement off the welfare rolls began long before Federal legislation. I'm not saying that's necessarily what's going on here, but it's one thing to consider."
Whether welfare change is the cause, it is true that the group for whom the gender gap widened the most was black women age 16 to 24. In 1996, such women earned 94.9 percent of the median weekly pay of black men their age, down from 101.6 percent in 1993.
When liberals discussed welfare overhaul and the pay gap, they tended to cite such a gap as a sign of the negative social impact of changes in welfare.
"We'd predicted, a while ago, that if welfare reform went fully in effect nationally, and moved a couple million people nationally from welfare to work, it would lower wages for low-wage workers as much as 12 percent," Mr. Bernstein said. "So we shouldn't be surprised if that's occurring. If the point of welfare reform was to lower wages, this is a success. People talked a lot about welfare recipients displacing other workers from their jobs, but now we have to wonder about another kind of displacement, wage displacement, in which the wages for all low-skilled jobs are depressed by all the new women from welfare looking for work."
Though some economists are just noticing the widening pay gap, many women have apparently been aware of the problem for a while. In a nationwide survey of women workers released last week, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. found that equal pay was the top concern cited -- and while 94 percent of the women surveyed said that equal pay for equal work was very important to them, more than a third said they did not get such equity at their current jobs.

U.S. Says It Could Sign A Modified Treaty on Mines
The United States could sign a treaty banning land mines if it got an additional nine years before removing them from the Korean peninsula, senior Clinton Administration officials said. The major policy shift came after already strong pressure from allies grew with the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, who had taken up the cause. A1
 
Israel Eases Some Pressure
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the Government would release another portion of the tax funds it had withheld from the Palestinian Authority, a step that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright sought last week. Israel also announced the easing of restrictions on Palestinian movements in the West Bank, which were imposed after suicide bombings. A1 

Congo in Standoff With U.N.
The new President of Congo, Laurent Kabila, is locked in a showdown with the United Nations over refugees and wartime atrocities. Diplomats say the powerful African allies who helped bring Mr. Kabila to power four months ago are pressuring him to resist. But the standoff could jeopardize the aid that Congo badly needs from world financial institutions. A1
 
Survey of North Korea Famine
An informal survey has found that about 15 percent of North Koreans in towns and villages may be dying of starvation and famine-related diseases, an official of the relief group World Vision said. The North Korean Government was not informed of the survey, which was carried out by ethnic Koreans living on the Chinese side of the border who can travel freely into North Korea. A11

High-Tech Sleuthing And the Invasion of Privacy
The world of computer technology and information marketing has turned private detectives into a vanguard of privacy invasion. Perhaps no case provides a better illustration than Texaco's investigation of people who filed claims after a 1992 refinery fire in California. Through commercial databases unknown to most people, law-enforcement computer files that are supposed to be off-limits to civilians, electronic surveillance equipment readily sold in spy shops and simple telephone schemes common in the information underground, Texaco amassed sensitive knowledge about dozens of people involved in the explosion claims, according to court documents, interviews and sworn statements.

The Value of Friendship
Thomas F. McLarty 3d was pushed out as President Clinton's chief of staff more than three years ago, but in certain circles, Mr. McLarty still wields considerable influence. Given the lofty if hazy title of "counselor to the President" and shunted to a basement office, Mr. McLarty can walk into the Oval Office or the Clintons' private living quarters unscheduled and unannounced. He is blithely candid about the secret of his survival. "I had the good fortune," he said, "to go to kindergarten with President Clinton." A1

HEADLINE: New Work Proposed For Shuttles: Salvage in Space

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
BILLIONS of dollars' worth of old communication, weather and spy satellites are circling Earth, dead or dormant and usually adrift. Typically, there is little or nothing wrong with them. They have just run out of fuel.
Space-age garbage?
Not to James C. Adamson, a former astronaut who is the chief operating officer of the United Space Alliance, the company that NASA has put in charge of running the space shuttles. 
 "Space salvage," Mr. Adamson said with the grin of Han Solo, the galactic wheeler-dealer of the "Star Wars" movies.
Most any rocket can carry payloads into orbit, he said in a recent interview at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But only the winged spaceships, with their cavernous cargo bays, can haul derelict craft back to Earth. If the shuttles "bring a lot of these dead birds back" for refurbishing, Mr. Adamson said, they could be returned to work in space and his company would make a tidy profit. "I'd love to do it," he said.
The potential enterprise signals looming change for the nation's fleet of spaceships. The shuttles are going commercial, slowly for now, then perhaps faster in the years ahead.
On Oct. 1, the United Space Alliance is to present the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at NASA's request, a detailed plan for privatizing the shuttles. A main agenda item is the return of shuttle flights and services to commercial missions.
Big commercial payloads like communication satellites were banned from the spaceships after the 1986 Challenger disaster, and some experts worry that the return of free-market forces could doom the temperamental shuttles to another catastrophe as economic pressures erode safety.
But many analysts say that the onset of private rigor is already improving shuttle performance and that in time, the process could save taxpayers billions of dollars. The nation's $68 billion fleet of space shuttles runs on an annual budget of $3.15 billion and is now limited to scientific and military missions.
In theory, complete privatization early in the next decade would have the Government spending little or no money on the shuttles other than fees for specific jobs and objectives.
The United Space Alliance has run the shuttles for one year and so far is generally given high marks. The spaceplanes are starting to thunder aloft without the serious delays that marred so many past missions, a testament to good planning and management.
"All the indications are that it's working beautifully," Jerry Grey, policy director of the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics, a professional group of aerospace engineers based in Washington, said of United Space's operation of the shuttle fleet.
"Most NASA people at the beginning were worried. They thought safety would suffer as costs were cut. Now, most seem reasonably happy with how things have gone. The consensus is in that things are moving in the right direction."
Mr. Adamson of United Space is upbeat about commercialization and the prospect of completely privatizing the shuttle effort.
"Here's a program that grew up in cold war days," he said. "We're trying to bend it around. I'm very optimistic. There are lots of opportunities."
The space shuttles, which first blasted into space in 1981, were designed to do commercial work. After their initial test flights, they did so with great regularity, carrying more than a dozen private satellites into orbit. They also made rescues that proved the principle of satellite recycling, at least for craft readily accessible in relatively low orbits.
When the booster engines of two communication satellites failed to work properly in February 1984, stranding them in useless orbits, the shuttle Discovery and its crew flew to the rescue the following November, carrying the satellites back to Earth for refurbishment and eventual return to space.
But the period of shuttle commercial flights ended abruptly in January 1986 when Challenger blew up shortly after launching, killing all seven crew members. President Ronald Reagan, worried that market forces had undercut safety, ordered all large commercial payloads off the shuttles that August.
The commercial idea was resurrected in the early 1990's by Daniel S. Goldin, the current NASA Administrator and a former aerospace executive who has struggled to have the sluggish agency do things smaller, cheaper, faster and better.
The shuttle program was back on its feet but financially bloated, Mr. Goldin reasoned. So he championed the commercial shift as a way to cut costs and free the agency to finance and pursue more futuristic work, like exploring distant worlds and looking for extraterrestrial life.
His ideas were backed in February 1995 by a NASA panel headed by Dr. Chris Kraft, an aerospace consultant and former director of the Johnson Space Center, an agency field installation in Houston.
"The Challenger incident created a safety environment in NASA that is duplicative and expensive," the Kraft panel reported, adding that it actually threatened to undermine safety by adding mazes of red tape.The panel called not only for private shuttle operation but also for an end to the ban on commercial payloads.
In September 1996, NASA signed a six-year, $7 billion contract to turn over most shuttle work to the United Space Alliance. United Space is a joint venture of the Boeing Company, the shuttle's maker, and the Lockheed Martin Corporation, a major shuttle contractor.
Since Oct. 1, United Space, which is based in Houston, has increasingly overseen the day-to-day work of the four-shuttle fleet and by all accounts is running them smoother and less expensively than ever before. Its contract calls for any savings to be divided between the company and the Federal Government, with hundreds of millions of saved dollars expected through the end of the initial contract.
At NASA's urging, United Space is now taking the process a step further by exploring new commercial markets. Last month, it hired Spacetec of Hampton, Va., a technology development and marketing company, to seek potential customers at home and abroad.
The early salesmanship focuses on the shuttle Columbia, which will not be used in building the planned International Space Station, the effort that will occupy the other three shuttles almost exclusively for nearly five years starting in 1998. Columbia, the first shuttle built, is too heavy to carry the heavy components of the outpost.
The envisioned commercial ventures include such varied ideas as advertising on Columbia's exterior and carrying tourists into orbit, though few passengers could probably afford the likely cost of $5 million to $10 million per trip.
A company wish list of other possible jobs includes using the shuttles to generate power, to manufacture goods, to aid mining operations on the Moon, to make educational shows and to loft human remains into orbit.
Glynn S. Lunney, a former NASA official who is now the United Space vice president for strategic and business planning, said the aim was to to do things for customers that rockets cannot do. Mr. Lunney added, however, that the shuttles might play a backup role to regular deployments by rockets.
"We don't know what our role might be in the existing market," he said in an interview, adding that it would "continue to evolve as we go along."
"We're taking a long horizon on this whole enterprise," he said. "We expect that the country is going to operate this system at least until 2010 or 2012."
United Space sees some of the brightest glitter in satellites, a multibillion-dollar industry expected to grow vigorously in years ahead as the world becomes more closely knit economically.
One intriguing idea that plays to shuttle strengths is satellite servicing and retrieval, especially in low orbits of hundreds of miles. It is there that spy satellites, some the world's most costly spacecraft, live and die.
A more ambitious goal is to fetch derelict craft orbiting 22,300 miles above the equator, the altitude at which craft circle Earth in sync with planetary rotation, keeping them stationary in the sky, unlike stars or the Sun.
The United States Space Command, which tracks space objects for the military from Colorado Springs, says 614 satellites populate the areas in and around this geostationary orbit, with roughly half of them dead or drifting uselessly.
Fran Slimmer, spokeswoman for the Hughes Space and Communications Company, the world's largest maker of communication satellites and a part of the General Motors Corporation, said most of the abandoned satellites suffer from a lack of maneuvering fuel rather than from serious problems like bad electronics. Satellites in geostationary orbit depend on fuel to stay precisely in the right spot so the operators of dish antennas on Earth know exactly where to find these beacons in space.
Retrieving the geostationary drifters would require space robots that could fly up from the shuttle's low orbit and carry the targets back down. Experts disagree on whether such work could be economical. But the construction of space tugs is nonetheless being explored.
In the future, experts say, the biggest challenge to shuttle privatization is not finding new markets but increasing the number of flights for the aging spacecraft so operating costs are spread out.
"Today," said Mr. Adamson of United Space, "we fly 7 to 8 flights a year. Without very much trouble I think we could comfortably fly 9 to 10, and with minimal additions, 11 to 12."
The big question is whether that approach courts disaster.
Most analysts agree that the Challenger catastrophe was partly rooted in a push to make the shuttle fleet pay for itself by carrying many Government, scientific and commercial payloads.
The year before the disaster, in 1985, the spaceships nearly doubled their rate of launchings by flying 9 missions, and faced plans for at least 24 a year by 1990. That was the atmosphere on Jan. 28, 1986, when Challenger began its last flight, carrying six astronauts and a high school teacher.
NASA itself is cautiously optimistic about the new push and eager to avoid repeating past mistakes.
"Our goal is to privatize the shuttle as soon as practical," Wilbur C. Trafton, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, wrote on Aug. 25 to the Johnson Space Center, which oversees the shuttles.
But the move, Mr. Trafton stressed, must be "consistent with maintaining or improving safety."
The plan envisions 2002 as the start of the private era. Ultimately, the success of the plan depends on whether the United Space Alliance and NASA can persuade Congress and the Clinton Administration to reverse post-Challenger policies that bar commercial payloads.
The allure is perhaps as great as the risk: turning the shuttle from a Federal hog into a lean, fly-for-profit business.
"We've got a trend that's building considerable momentum," said Mr. Lunney of United Space. "It's not a question of doing it anymore. It's a matter of when and how."

Charts: "A Profit Center, 22,300 Miles Up"
Hundreds of satellites, dead and useless, are in orbits that keep them stationary above particular spots on Earth. Shuttles could make money by retrieving these craft for repairs or refueling and then lofting them back into orbit. Removing obsolete satellites could also clear valuable spots in orbits about 22,300 miles up, where orbiting craft remain in sync with Earth's rotation.

HEADLINE: Private-Suite Concept Is Coming to Broadway

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Skyboxes and luxury suites have all but saturated the sports world, providing cushy retreats for corporate executives and big-ticket fans in football stadiums and basketball arenas, at golf championships and tennis tournaments.
Now, the concept is coming to Broadway. When "Ragtime: The Musical" starts previews in December at the new Ford Center for the Performing Arts in Times Square, 50 tickets a performance, at $125 each, will be available for what the theater's developer describes as "V.I.P. suite service." Those ticket holders will be able to make use of a private suite beneath the theater's lobby where they can check coats, sip free cocktails and make use of uncrowded restrooms. Their seats will be center stage, rows 6 to 12. 
 The $125 price is $50 higher than that for the best orchestra seats at "Ragtime," but it is not a Broadway record. Producers of other shows have offered more expensive promotions. At "Victor/Victoria," the musical that closed this summer, a limited number of seats were available for $145 in the first two rows, with some amenities thrown into the package.
Livent, the Ford Center's developer, runs similar suites in theaters in Toronto and in Vancouver, British Columbia, and is building one in a theater now under construction in Chicago. Garth Drabinsky, chairman of Livent, said the special service would offer patrons "an evening at the theater that was complete, from the moment they walked in to the moment they left."
In recent years, a number of Broadway producers, seeking to attract corporate executives and their often lavish entertainment budgets, have marketed "champagne boxes" with free drinks and other perks, or "preferred" seating in the front rows, at premium prices. But space constraints at most theaters made it impossible to offer amenities in a private environment.
"You've got a certain clientele that is used to being pampered," said John Scher, a producer of "Victor/Victoria," who said he had unsuccessfully tried to offer a similar hospitality suite in the hotel adjacent to the Marquis Theater during the show's two-year run.
"This is long overdue," Mr. Scher said. "There's a higher tier of theatergoers that is used to being pampered at the great restaurants in Manhattan, in the private boxes at the Garden, the Meadowlands. Even the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark has dining rooms next to the private boxes."
Mr. Drabinsky insisted that the $50 price difference for V.I.P. tickets was justified by the perks associated with entry to the 850-square-foot basement room, which will be open before the show and during intermission, and will be staffed by three attendants.
But Paul Libin, vice president of the Jujamcyn Theaters Corporation, which owns five Broadway houses, called it a simple excuse to raise ticket prices. "No one has to pay $50 to hang up their coat and go to a bathroom in the basement," he said. "You're getting the best seats in the house, and you're paying a premium for it."
Others said that the advent of "business class" in the theater might take some business away from ticket brokers. "Business people already buy their tickets from brokers, because they can get better seats than you do from the box office," said Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater. Mr. Drabinsky, he said, "is just cutting out the middleman."
Mr. Scher, who heads the Metropolitan Entertainment Group, said that the economics of Broadway, which are far less lucrative than those of professional sports, are forcing producers to search for every source of added income. "If there are any new theaters to be built in New York, every single one will try to create this kind of space," he said.
Whatever the result, Mr. Drabinsky said, the market for higher-priced seats, suites and perks appears to be a fertile one. Livent sold 2,000 V.I.P. tickets -- enough for 40 performances -- last Wednesday, its first day of sales.
Nicholas J. Verbitsky, president of United Stations Radio Networks, a company that produces radio programming for 3,000 stations, ordered four tickets to a mid-February performance of "Ragtime." "To entertain a station owner or an advertising executive and his or her spouse, for four tickets it's $200 -- that's money well spent," he said.
"You're not standing up getting a Coke at the refreshment stand, you're going to a private area," he added.
"It's supposedly exclusive. And the seats are right down in front. If you called up Ticketmaster, the seats wouldn't be available. And if you went to a scalper, it'd be a heck of a lot more money then $125."

HEADLINE: Welfare's New Face?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The most interesting point in your Sept. 11 front-page article on the changing image of welfare recipients is that state officials of both parties increasingly recognize that it is not so easy to save money reforming welfare. Most welfare recipients are likely at first to land low-paying jobs; thus the need for public investment in supplementing incomes continues. The demand for child care, health care, transportation, training and other services is likely to grow. 
 It is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. We do not know what might happen when the economy slows. But the early evidence shows that the social experiments under way in the states are not so much shrinking the safety net as redefining it. I hope the new definition of success goes beyond declining caseloads to emphasize true integration of the poor into our economy.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against the Mark On Hint of German Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark yesterday after the president of the Bundesbank hinted that it might soon raise interest rates.
The Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, said Germany would have less flexibility to raise interest rates after May 1998, when European officials will decide which countries will be part of the planned economic and monetary union. 
 There will be less room to maneuver on interest rates, Mr. Tietmeyer said, suggesting to currency traders that there was a greater likelihood that the central bank would raise rates before then. "The mark's starting to look more favorable on the threat of the Bundesbank raising rates," said Dave Moline, a currency trader at Norwest Bank.
Mr. Tietmeyer's remarks followed a decision by European Union finance ministers this weekend that they would announce in May 1998 the levels at which European currencies would be valued against each other when the single currency, the euro, is introduced. At the same time, they plan to announce which countries will take part.
European Union leaders are trying to avoid unexpected fluctuations in the currencies between May 1998 and Jan. 1, 1999, when the euro is set to begin. That will keep central bankers from making substantial changes in interest rates, or any other moves that could derail the project.
The decision is also heightening expectation that the Bundesbank will raise rates. Countries are expected to bring their interest rates in line with other members' rates.
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.7629 marks, down from 1.7720 marks late Friday and 7 percent below an eight-year high reached Aug. 6. The dollar's weakness against the mark also helped it tumble to its lowest against the Swiss franc in two and a half months. The dollar was quoted at 1.4470 Swiss francs, down from 1.4635 Swiss francs. The British pound fell to $1.6051, from $1.6059.
The dollar fell against the yen amid concern over the rising United States trade deficit with Japan and as traders look to next weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Hong Kong.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 120.31 yen, down from 120.96 yen on Friday.

Thorn to Appeal Ruling on Rental Stores

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The British rental company Thorn P.L.C. said today that it planned to appeal a United States ruling about its Rent-A-Center stores that could cost the company $120 million in damages.
A suit said the company, which "rents to own" household furnishings, charged its mostly low-income customers interest rates that exceeded state law. 
 Thorn said a New Jersey Superior Court judge ruled last week that the company owed customers fees and interest paid for furniture and small appliances at its Rent-A-Center stores.
The judge ruled that each customer was entitled to recover 40 percent of what had been paid to Rent-A-Center but that the awards could be trebled under the state's consumer fraud law.
Thorn's shares dropped about 7 percent, or 12 pence (19.3 cents), to 154 pence ($2.47) to rank among the biggest percentage losers on the London Stock Exchange today.
Thorn provisionally estimated total potential damages at $120 million before legal fees.
Thorn said judgments made under New Jersey law had no application beyond that state.
It has 24 stores in New Jersey out of a total of more than 1,400 stores throughout the United States.

HEADLINE: Albright Says She Found 'Tattered' Mideast Situation

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: SHANNON, Ireland, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Evaluating her first official trip to the Middle East, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today, "The crisis of confidence there is worse than I thought -- it's fairly tattered."
She will "stay absorbed" in the issue, she said en route home after her weeklong trip, but added that she had many other world problems to occupy her if Middle East leaders are not prepared to make basic decisions about working together. 
 "The responsibilities of the United States are so large that I can't be occupied with this full time," she said. "On the other hand, I will be available to go when it is necessary and to make a difference if I can."
"Probably more than at any other period of history, the Secretary of State of the United States is called upon to be involved in or part of a host of problems that require his, or, in this case her, attention," she said.
But it is important not to waste time and effort, she added, which was also a kind of warning to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
"If I can make a difference, I will be there," she said. "I don't have to wait to be summoned by phone. But if there's not enough happening for me to make a difference, then I'm going to concentrate on what's happening in Cambodia, or on our summit with the Chinese, and Bosnia certainly and NATO expansion and meeting with the Russians in New York."
After a not-very-successful effort to keep secret her plans to stop in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, she made an emotional visit there today. She and her party flew from Larnaca, Cyprus, in three American military helicopters with no markings and traveled in an armed convoy flanked by trucks with light machine guns protruding from their roofs.
It was the first such visit to Beirut by a Secretary of State since March 1993, although Warren Christopher visited Lebanese leaders in southern Lebanon in April 1996. Ms. Albright recently lifted the legal ban on the use of American passports to travel to Lebanon, a move appreciated by Lebanon's leaders, while Washington still issues strong official warnings about the dangers of travel there.
In her speech in Beirut today, she stressed to officials and about 70 carefully invited citizens America's support for Lebanon's "sovereignty and territorial integrity" -- despite the Syrian and Israeli troops that have been stationed there for years.
She also made it clear that Washington would not accept a final peace in the Middle East that left Lebanon occupied or divided, although she did not mention Syria or Israel by name. "We respect your vision of a Lebanon that is not beholden to any foreign power," she said.
And she described her effort to revive Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese peace talks this way: "Here, too, we have at least agreed to talk further about further talks. In the absence of a peace elevator, we are methodically taking the stairs."
Despite the crisis of confidence she found in the Middle East, she felt she had made a small beginning, she told reporters on her plane. "I said I was going there to give them a reality check," she said. "So I decided to be really unvarnished in the way I stated the case."
She said early steps by Mr. Arafat to move against the infrastructure of terrorism and by Mr. Netanyahu to ease the economic pressures on Mr. Arafat "are useful" and "move in the right direction."
Whatever the leaders think about each other, she said, "the fact is that they must work with one another, and the term 'necessary partners,' I think, becomes the key." One of her main themes wherever she went, she said, was "mutual responsibility for the peace process."
The fight against terrorism is separate and primary, she said. But by mutual responsibility for the Arabs, she said she meant ending "the war of words" against Israel and the habit of going to the Security Council to seek a condemnation of the Israelis at every moment. "It inflames the situation, and frankly it was one of the points I discussed with them when I said the other Arab nations also had a responsibility for the peace process," she said.
At least the parties will be talking again, she said, citing a new round of discussions in Washington on Sept. 23 between Israel and the Palestinians, with a follow-up meeting by foreign ministers. Later this month in New York, she is to hold individual meetings with the Israeli and Syrian Foreign Ministers.
"I'm pleased with some of the things I've seen, but we've a long way to go," she said. "But I am not going to overestimate what's going on here."

HEADLINE: A Promise Is Kept: Mill Reopens

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: LAWRENCE, Mass., Sept. 14

 BODY:
All in all, this was a very good day for Aaron Feuerstein, owner of Malden Mills and national poster mensch of the nascent American business vogue for having a heart, better known as corporate responsibility.
President Clinton sent congratulations. Thousands of Mr. Feuerstein's employees and their families celebrated the dedication of his gleaming, new $130 million factory in the streets of this old Massachusetts mill town. And best of all, Mr. Feuerstein could announce that true to his word, just 21 months after the heart of his textile plant burned to the ground, he has rebuilt it here and rehired nearly all of his 2,700 workers. 
 "I thank you, God, for most this amazing day -- I who have died am alive again today," Mr. Feuerstein said, quoting E. E. Cummings, and then moved, with his usual theatrical combination of literary erudition and Orthodox Jewish tradition, to a version of a Hebrew prayer: "I thank you, majestic God of the universe, for restoring to Malden Mills and its employees, our life and soul."
The plant, which produces Polartec and Polarfleece, the warm, light-weight synthetic material used mainly in outdoor clothing, is back, at more than 100 percent of its capacity at the time of the fire, he said. Officials say the company's sales are up 40 percent since the fire, in December 1995, its productivity is up 25 percent, and the company plans to bring back the last 70 of its workers within two months.
In late 1995, when American industry was still enmeshed in a period of painful downsizing, Mr. Feuerstein took a dramatic and very public gamble: after a Christmas-season fire and explosion ravaged three critical plant buildings with a total of 600,000 square feet, he promised to rebuild here instead of taking the $300 million in insurance money and moving the plant to another state or even Mexico.
He was also protecting a booming business and a highly skilled work force, but with that pledge, he turned himself into a national symbol, hailed by the White House, unions and the press, of a company's loyalty to its workers.
Today, jubilant attendees at the dedication continued to attribute a broader symbolism to Mr. Feuerstein, this time to his success: It is an example, said Jay Mazur, national president of Unite!, the garment workers' union, of "taking the high road to make the product better instead of the low road of cheapening the product, downsizing the workers and running away to another location."
"Let's hear it for America's number one mensch," proclaimed Robert B. Reich, the former Secretary of Labor, using the Yiddish word for a honorable person.
Mr. Feuerstein's loyalty is not unique. After a January 1995 fire in LaGrange, Ga., at the biggest plant owned by Milliken and Company, the largest privately-held textile company in the country, the owner, Roger Milliken, promised its 680 workers that it would be back in production within six months. He gave them jobs at other plants at the same pay until they returned to the plant that had burned.
Also, economists note, Mr. Feuerstein's commitment to keep his plant and its 2,700 jobs in this northeastern Massachusetts town might not have worked if the company had not already been on a roll, making high-technology, high-performance products for which there is a potent niche demand.
"To understand the Malden Mills story, one has to understand a larger shift in the industry, and the fact that Aaron Feuerstein is a brilliant businessman at understanding that," said David Weil, a textile industry expert at Boston University's school of management.
Mr. Feuerstein, he said, had already managed to refine a high-quality product and maintain great flexibility and speed in filling customers' orders. He also had assembled a highly skilled work force that he had great incentive to keep.
But that, Mr. Weil hastened to add, is not to take away from Mr. Feuerstein's ethically admirable decision to keep his company here.
The driving force behind his decision, Mr. Feuerstein told the dedication crowd, was his conviction that "there was no way that I was going to take 3,000 people and throw them into the street. And there was no way I was going to condemn Lawrence to economic oblivion. No."
Though it was that single-minded tenacity that gained him so much attention, Mr. Feuerstein also serves as an example of how to solicit outside help. Federal, state and local politicians from senators to mayors, union leaders and lenders all helped get Malden Mills, which is an economic anchor of northeastern Massachusetts, through its crisis.
Not everyone could call on BankBoston for money to tide over the company until the insurance settlement came through and be patted on the back and told not to worry by the chief executive officer, Chad Gifford, of that regional powerhouse bank.
But any company owner would aspire to the kind of gleaming-eyed, standing-ovation appreciation that Mr. Feueurstein, 72, is now accorded by his employees.
"The community loves him very much and it's not hype and it's not the upper class, it's the people," said Julio Fernandez, a machine operator. "He treats all the employees with the utmost respect."
And he plans to continue doing so for a long time, said Mr. Feuerstein's wife, Louise. The designated worrier in the family, she expresses concern even now about whether the company's success will continue, especially under the pressure of its heightened visibility. But one thing she knows about her husband: "He has no plans whatsoever to ever retire."

HEADLINE: Havana Seeks Death Sentence For American

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Cuban prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for an American citizen held in Cuba on charges of working for a "terrorist" group in Miami, diplomats said today.
The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the American citizen, Walter Van der Veer, had been held since Aug. 21, 1996. 
 In March, Cuba's state television described Mr. Van der Veer as a "highly dangerous mercenary" and "an agent of a terrorist organization in Miami" and said his operations were financed and directed by a Miami-based Cuban exile group, which it identified as the Cuban Liberation Front.
The report said he had smuggled military equipment including incendiary devices into Cuba and planned actions against unspecified "socio-economic, religious and military centers" with the aim of "subverting internal order and the stability of our nation."
In Miami, a lawyer for Mr. Van der Veer, Ellis Rubin, said he would urge the United States Government to intercede on Mr. Van der Veer's behalf.
Mr. Rubin said today that Mr. Van der Veer had been on a charity mission to Cuba on behalf of the Church of the Little Flower in Coral Gables, Fla.
At the time of his arrest, associates described Mr. Van der Veer, 51, as both an anti-Castro commando and a humanitarian worker. But his trip to Cuba had no military aims, they said.
Mr. Rubin said he had not been allowed to go to Cuba to represent Mr. Van der Veer, and said he would appeal to President Clinton and the State Department to monitor the situation.
The diplomats said officials of the United States Interests Section in Havana had been allowed access to Mr. Van der Veer.
No trial date has been set.
Cuban authorities contend that Cuban exiles are organizing and financing attempts to try to overthrow the Government.

HEADLINE: Equity Office Properties to Absorb Beacon

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Equity Office Properties Trust, which Sam Zell had already fashioned into the nation's largest publicly traded office real estate empire, today announced plans to acquire the Beacon Properties Corporation, its nearest competitor, in a merger valued at about $2.9 billion plus debt.
Mr. Zell, a billionaire with a legendary eye for undervalued real estate and companies, called the deal a "one plus one equals three opportunity." He said it would give Equity Office the leverage in crucial markets to negotiate better deals with large tenants and with suppliers of building services and equipment. The more immediate payback would be a $15 million to $20 million savings from closing overlapping administrative offices, he said. 
 The merger would leave Equity, which is based here, as a leading owner of prime office space in Boston, Atlanta, Washington, Dallas, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as Chicago. Just over half of its 233 office buildings would be suburban. Equity Office also owns a chain of urban parking garages that can be marketed along with its buildings.
"We view ourselves as the dominant player in a gigantic industry," Mr. Zell said in a conference call with analysts. "Our scale will separate us from everyone else."
Analysts said that the deal spotlighted the growing clout of publicly owned real estate trusts, known as REIT's, and consolidation in the industry as leading investors race to accumulate assets. However, despite Mr. Zell's talk of dominance, Equity Office would still own less than 2 percent of the nation's prime office real estate. Analysts calculate that Equity Office already owns nearly half of the Stamford, Conn., market, but Equity Office's share in the biggest urban markets is under 10 percent.
Still, analysts agreed that the deal was a blockbuster likely to enhance Mr. Zell's reputation as a champion of REIT's. He also controls REIT's that are the largest players in the mobile home and apartment sectors.
Many analysts were surprised not that Mr. Zell wanted the merger but that Beacon, which is based in Boston, would so willingly give up its freedom. It was the fastest-growing REIT in the country during the second quarter of this year and had been performing well. Alan M. Leventhal, president and chief executive of Beacon, which his family built up over two generations and took public four years ago, said the deal began taking shape when he and Mr. Zell met on vacation in New Hampshire in August.
"Our outlook on the marketplace is very similar," said Mr. Leventhal, who will join Equity Office's board along with Edwin Sidman, Beacon's chairman, but will have no direct role in management. At current prices, Beacon shareholders will end up owning slightly more than one-third of Equity Office after completion of the deal, which is expected early next year.
"It's probably a win-win for both companies," said Edward Linde, president of Boston Properties Inc., a major office REIT based in New York that also recently went public.
Beacon's shares jumped $6, to $42.625, in heavy trading on the Big Board following the announcement. Although Equity Office executives said the deal would immediately improve the company's earnings and reduce its debt, investors were nervous. Shares of Equity Office , which had jumped more than 50 percent since the company went public at $21 a share July 8, fell $1.375, to $31.6875.
Under the deal, each Beacon shareholder will receive 1.4063 Equity Office common shares, and Equity will assume $883 million of Beacon debt and issue $200 million in preferred stock.
"It's a very rich price for Beacon, about a 40 percent premium to the underlying value of Beacon's assets," said John Lutzius, an analyst with Green Street Advisors Inc., a Newport Beach, Calif., firm that specializes in real estate research for institutional investors.
Whether the deal pays off or not depends in part on whether Mr. Zell's rosy assessment of the office market is correct. Mr. Zell began buying office buildings for investment funds he managed in the 1980's. His backers included insurance companies like Allstate and large pension funds. The various investment funds were brought together to form Equity Office, which sold just under 16 percent of its shares to the public in the July offering.
Equity Office was wildly popular with investors because rents in many cities have soared. A combination of economic growth and a shortage of new buildings has bolstered occupancy rates.
Mr. Zell said today that he believed rents would have to climb 30 percent to 40 percent more before Equity Office and other building owners start running into serious competition from new building projects. In some key markets like San Francisco and Boston, the barriers to new building are especially high, he said.
"We expect clear sailing for the next few years," Mr. Zell said.
Some real estate experts said Equity Office might be overestimating the value of large-scale operations in its segment of the real estate industry.

A New York Bank To Stay in the Bronx

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Spurred by a package of city tax incentives, the New York National Bank has decided against moving out of New York and will instead move its corporate headquarters to another part of the South Bronx, where it will also open a new branch, the city announced yesterday.
The privately held bank, the only minority-owned commercial bank in the state, had planned to move its headquarters at 960 Southern Boulevard to Westchester County. But under an agreement with the city's Economic Development Corporation, the bank will receive a maximum of about $448,000 in sales tax exemptions and $75,000 in energy discounts. The bank will also receive up to $195,000 in additional sales tax exemptions if it creates 73 new jobs over the next 20 years. 
 "We are pleased that we have identified a site that will insure our ability to keep our headquarters and back-office personnel here in the South Bronx," said Serafin Mariel, president and chief executive officer of the bank, which has 67 employees.
The bank will invest $1.1 million in capital improvements at its new headquarters, a 30,000-square-foot building, at 369 East 149th Street near Third Avenue, which will also house its new branch.

HEADLINE: Downsizing Activism: Greenpeace Is Cutting Back

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
After 48 hours of daredevil dangling on ropes from a bridge in Seattle, trying to block outgoing trawlers in a recent protest against overfishing, Greenpeace staff members returned to solid ground, only to be told that the environmental group had just laid three of them off.
Here in Boston last week, a staff member in the group's Back Bay office unhappily carted out a giant Greenpeace sign, no longer needed now that the place was all but abandoned. And in a handful of other cities from Minneapolis to Santa Cruz, Calif., Greenpeace offices had been dismantled or were in the last stages of closing. 
 Around the country, Greenpeace officials say, the world's best-known environmental action group is suffering through the biggest retrenchment it has ever seen in the United States. It is disassembling all 10 of its permanent branch offices and ending the signature door-to-door canvassing that led one critic to call it the Avon Lady of the environmental movement.
It is also laying off about 335 of its 400 staff members, most of them canvassers. The spirit is still willing, officials say, but the finances are weak, and in the face of plummeting membership and a deficit of $2.6 million halfway through the year, Greenpeace is cutting its annual budget in the United States to $21 million from $29 million. The group is also narrowing its focus, planning to concentrate more on campaigns against global warming and forest destruction and somewhat less on toxic waste and overfishing.
"If this is a signal that the public has become so apathetic or uninformed about our environmental devastation, it's tragic," said Niaz Dorry, the Boston staff member carting off the sign for a smaller office in Gloucester, Mass.
Since its grandstanding beginning in 1971, when a dozen protesters in a small boat sought to block nuclear testing in the Aleutian Islands, Greenpeace has weathered many an internal storm, many a tactical mistake and many a cutback.
But the scale of the current downsizing has prompted a new spell of particularly intense soul-searching, and the 170-member board of the United States arm of Greenpeace met in Washington last weekend to discuss what went wrong and what should be done.
Greenpeace International has offices in 32 countries, a worldwide budget of nearly $146 million and worldwide membership of almost 3 million people. Global membership has remained stable while the United States organization's memberships have fallen. Because Greenpeace is expanding its work in Asian and Latin American countries -- work that the United States offices subsidize -- it can no longer afford a financial drain in its American operations, said Kristen Engberg, acting director in the United States.
The United States group's cutbacks have prompted outsiders to analyze what the group's problems say about how environmental organizations in this country have had to change in the last few years as the world has changed around them.
The whales are pretty well saved, environmental historians and top officials in several other national groups say; the Clinton White House is generally friendly to the environment; many more businesses try to respect the environment than ever before, and other national groups have developed highly sophisticated lobbying and outreach methods.
It could well be, some said, that in an era when environmental issues seem to hinge more on complex trade-offs than on an all-or-nothing approach, the time has passed for the classic Greenpeace tactics of telegenic "direct actions" in which protesters rode tiny inflatable motorboats to face down whalers.
Greenpeace, said Rindy O'Brien, vice president of public policy for the Wilderness Society, has tended to look for ways to publicize problems instead of ways to actually solve them. Her comments echoed longstanding criticism by others that Greenpeace is too much of a self-promotion machine.
"I do think the public, in more of the political realm, are looking for solutions rather than maybe extremists," Ms. O'Brien said, "and I think that separates Greenpeace from the other environmental groups."
Four things happened that hurt Greenpeace, said a top official at another environmental group who insisted on anonymity. With an international moratorium on commercial whaling, Greenpeace lost a flagship issue; its tactics became more familiar and so drew less attention; it fell into a debilitating internal debate about its own mission, and it shifted more toward helping local environmental groups behind the scenes, which lowered its profile.
"They ended up with a confused and weak public perception of what they were," the official said. "They're not really a grass-roots organization like the Sierra Club or the Audubon Society. When people stopped seeing Greenpeace on TV and started reading confusing things about it, they drifted away."
But Greenpeace officials say that though they will be narrowing their focus and shifting from permanent branch offices to mobile campaign teams, their basic philosophy and tactics of uncompromising, high-profile protests will remain in force. And they have always sought solutions with industry and government, the officials say, but those efforts never received wide attention.
The cutbacks, Greenpeace staff members say, are mainly a reflection of past poor management, including shoddy record-keeping that allowed membership to drop to about 400,000 from 1.2 million in 1991, and annual United States donations to fall to about $25 million from $45 million. The staff members also say that by dropping the canvassers and the offices from which they worked, the organization can do its work more efficiently.
"The canvass was a costly operation in terms of its administrative and overhead cost," said Ms. Engberg, the acting director. "By having these fixed costs of 10 offices, it gave the U.S. organization less flexibility in how it could spend its money on campaigning."
The canvassers' function was dual: They signed people up for dues-paying memberships, at a minimum of $30 a year for those who wanted to receive the group's magazine, and educated them on current issues and campaigns.
Greenpeace International has been headed for the last two years by Thilo Bode, a bottom-line German economist who has also overseen the streamlining of several offices in other countries.
But the United States group is particularly important, said Ms. Engberg, because each national office sets aside a percentage of its proceeds to be redistributed for work in needier countries. The United States organization, which contributes 18 percent, is one of the four biggest Greenpeace branches, she said.
"It's a very difficult but necessary decision for the health of Greenpeace around the world," Ms. Engberg said.
As Greenpeace's work has stabilized in Western countries, the international organization has focused increasingly on environmental problems in Southeast Asia, China and Latin America -- work it needs American money to help pay for.
The decision to cut back the United States offices was made by the organization's board of directors for the United States, an executive group that could not be overridden at the meeting last weekend of the board of all voting members. The weekend meeting created a committee to plot a strategy for the future of Greenpeace in the United States.
Greenpeace staff members in United States offices also attributed the downsizing to new competition for charity money from social service groups in this period of cutbacks in Government support for the poor.
"We used to compete with other environmental organizations," said Mark Floegel, a Seattle staff member who is being laid off. "Now we compete with the homeless. People who gave $50 a year to Greenpeace now have to decide between that and Save the Children and a homeless shelter."
Other national environmental groups, however, say that their membership and donations have stayed about steady over the last several years. In the period when Greenpeace lost 800,000 members, for example, the Sierra Club has stayed roughly steady at 600,000 and the Wilderness Society at 250,000.
The main explanation, some Greenpeace officials acknowledge, may be that the group was simply not equipped to sustain the membership boom that occurred after French frogmen sank the group's ship, the Rainbow Warrior, while it was trying to block nuclear testing in the Pacific in 1985.
"There's no question our development office made tremendous mistakes," said Dave Batke, a research coordinator in the Seattle office. "Names were not entered when people joined Greenpeace. There was some mismanagement."
Faulty recruitment arrangements may be relatively simple to remedy; what is less clear to both members and environmental historians is whether the tactic of closing branch offices, while keeping its Washington headquarters largely intact, is a good idea.
"If they're going to concentrate on Beltway stuff, they're getting into a crowded market," said Philip Shabecoff, a former reporter for The New York Times and author of "A New Name for Peace," (University Press of New England, 1996), a book on international environmentalism. "I personally think it's a big mistake for Greenpeace. They had their own mission in the environmental movement -- they were kind of the troublemakers, the people who made noise and raised tension on issues, and on top of that they were one of the few national groups that actually went out door to door."
Aside from possible doubts about the decision, staff members in Greenpeace offices around the country have been grappling with the pain of losing jobs that are much more than jobs to most.
"Certain jobs I've had in my life were 9-to-5 jobs," said Mr. Floegel in Seattle. "Greenpeace is a way people identify themselves. It's like if you take a bunch of priests and tell them they're laid off because of cutbacks.
"There's a sense of loss about the work. That's ahead of people's concern for their well-being and how they're going to make the rent."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise As Investors Await Reports

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose slightly yesterday as investors waited for today's reports on consumer prices and industrial production and capacity utilization in August, which are expected to provide more proof that the economy is expanding at a noninflationary pace.
The 30-year bond gained 6/32, to 97 15/32, to yield 6.57 percent, down from 6.58 percent at the close on Friday. 
 Friday's reports on retail sales and producer prices for August, which were not as negative as the market had feared, quieted worries that the Federal Reserve was likely to increase short-term interest rates at its monetary policy meeting on Sept. 30.
Michelle Laughlin, Treasury market strategist at Prudential Securities, expects the market to focus on the Consumer Price Index. "Our forecast of five-tenths of a percent over all, and three-tenths of a percent excluding food and energy, is above the consensus of three-tenths of a percent and two-tenths of a percent, respectively," she said, noting that last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics warned that the index could spike in August because of rising gasoline prices, which were exaggerated by seasonal factors.
She said that an unfavorable index "will not alter our outlook for continued low inflation." Ms. Laughlin said she did not expect the Fed to move, even in November, and added, "The odds are less than 50 percent they will move between now and year-end."
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the light trading yesterday appeared to be a squaring of positions by traders ahead of today's consumer price report.
"The market reached a technical level at the close of trading." Mr. Regan said yesterday, "which would indicate that favorable noninflationary data in the numbers tomorrow will propel the long bond up another half to three quarters of a point in price. That would push the yield closer to the 6.50 percent level."
The price report will be important, but if the other indicators like industrial production and capacity, coupled with business inventories, are in line with expectations, Mr. Regan said, the market may move up.
Other factors affecting the market will be the scheduled release of the Fed's beige book report on regional economic conditions tomorrow, in preparation for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and an announcement by the Treasury of the size of its auctions of two- and five-year notes the following week.
"There is some speculation among market participants that there could be a draw-down in the auction amounts," Mr. Regan said. "My opinion is that the Treasury would not like to have a liquidity crunch."
Rates at yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills dropped modestly, with the average for a three-month maturity down 10 basis points, to 4.91 percent, and a six-month down 6 basis points, to 5.08 percent. A basis point is one hundredth of 1 percent.
Kim Rupert, a San Francisco-based economist at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm, said the bill auction was worse than expected, considering the reinvestment demand from the $44 billion in cash management bills maturing this week.
"It looks as though they are a bit too rich, having gotten expensive over the last few days," Ms. Rupert said. One reason is that the Treasury has reduced the supply of bills by $1 billion.
The following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.759	97.432	Discounted Rate	4.91%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.04%	5.29%	High Price	98.764	97.442	Discounted Rate	4.89%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.02%	5.26%	Low Price	98.759	97.432	Discounted Rate	4.91%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.04%	5.29%	Accepted at low price	43%	25%	Total applied for	$39,871,563	$43,925,641	Accepted	$11,266,623	$10,982,829	Noncompetitive	$1,307,955	$1,247,606	

Both issues are dated Sept. 18, 1997. The three-monthbills mature on Dec. 18, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on March 19, 1998.

HEADLINE: Prison in the Forest;
The Itinerant Jailer Is an Adirondack Plan's Best Booster

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: TUPPER LAKE, N.Y., Sept. 10

 BODY:
In the Adirondacks, Richard Moeller is the prototypical migrant worker, though you might not realize it from his job description. He does not pick vegetables, trap beaver or sell encyclopedias. He is a prison guard.
Each week for the past three years, he has traveled hundreds of miles from home -- as far as Sing Sing Correctional Facility, 250 miles to the south in Ossining -- to watch over some of the state's most violent convicts. At night, he sleeps on a mattress in a rented room, alongside a dozen other men, counting the hours until his days off. All because guarding inmates is among the steadiest, best-paying jobs a man from the North Country can find. 
 But Mr. Moeller, who has three brothers who are also prison guards, has never thought about moving his family out of Tupper Lake to be closer to his job. Life in the city, as he refers to Westchester County and Utica, where he now works, is too dirty and crime ridden, he says. And where else could he afford a rustic, 12-acre spread like the one he owns now?
So it comes as no surprise that Mr. Moeller, 27, and his brothers are thrilled that the New York State Legislature decided last month to build a 750-cell maximum-security prison on the outskirts of Tupper Lake. Along with about 170 other correction officers who live in this village of 4,100 residents, they are hoping the new prison will finally spell an end to their long commutes.
"This is where I want to make my home," he said.
But the prison has touched off a fierce debate over the future of this mountainous region that has pitted neighbor against neighbor, worker against worker, even sibling against sibling. The fight has focused not just on Tupper Lake, but on the entire Adirondack Park, six million mostly pristine acres of public and private land that includes 4,000 lakes and ponds, the source of the Hudson River and the state's highest peaks.
To critics, the verdant North Country has become overly dependent on the penitentiary business, whose latest growth spurt is being fueled by tougher prison sentences established by the Legislature in 1995. Tupper Lake would be the fifth state prison inside what is known as the blue line, the boundaries of the largest American park outside Alaska. If the counties bordering Adirondack Park are included, there are 14 prisons in the North Country, holding a total of nearly 15,000 inmates.
But the critics contend that each new prison detracts from the natural beauty of the place, discouraging efforts to make the Adirondacks a more popular destination for tourists and nature lovers. And they question why the state is building a prison at Tupper Lake even as it tries to prevent development on nearby Whitney Park, 51,000 unspoiled acres owned by the descendents of William C. Whitney, the industrialist who built a fortune on oil, tobacco and New York City streetcars a century ago.
"This does not capitalize on the special qualities of the park," said Eric J. Siy, Adirondack project director for Environmental Advocates, a nonprofit group. "It diminishes those qualities."
But to supporters of the prison, including most of the region's elected officials and many business owners, such critics are out of touch with the hardscrabble reality of the Adirondacks. With double-digit unemployment rates during the long winters, a dying logging industry and downtowns that are pockmarked by vacant storefronts, the region desperately needs the economic lift that prisons can provide, they say.
"If your kids can't find a good job, they leave," said Robert J. Bierwirth, 49, who owns the local McDonald's. "That's why having a prison is held in such high regard. We'd rather have I.B.M. But realistically, a prison is what we can get."
Many business owners said news of the prison gave them newfound confidence in the local economy. With a $130 million price tag, the prison is expected to generate scores of local construction jobs. And when it is completed, possibly in 1999, it is expected to create more than 100 permanent jobs and pump $19 million each year into the economy.
As a result, Mr. Bierwirth has scrapped plans to sell and now wants to expand. A developer is talking about building the town's first indoor mall. And prison guards from other towns have begun inquiring about buying houses in Tupper Lake.
One businessman, Peter S. Day, said he used to oppose the prison on the ground that it would hurt business at the Big Tupper Ski Area, which he owns. But he became a convert a few winters ago when he saw a dozen prison guards at his bar, buying drinks and lunch. They had rearranged their work schedules so they could ski midweek, when the lift lines were short -- a flexibility that was not lost on Mr. Day.
"The Adirondacks have broken a lot of men," said Mr. Day, noting that the average prison guard earns $35,000 a year, well above the local median income of about $25,000. "It's remote. It's inhospitable in winter. There's nothing much here to make a living off of. We need all the help we can get."
The prison will be the state's first maximum-security penitentiary in nine years. Plans call for it to be built on a 100-acre tree farm in an area zoned for an industrial park. It will house as many as 1,500 prisoners, most of whom will be those deemed disciplinary problems and transferred from other prisons.
Its obstreperous inmates will be kept in 105-square-foot cells all day, minimizing contact with guards and other prisoners alike. Meals will be eaten in cells, and even exercise time will be spent in tiny areas attached to each cell.
The prison will employ up to 367 workers, 223 of them guards. Under union rules, all of the guard jobs will be filled by transfers from other state prisons. The remaining 110 to 140 support staff jobs will be filled largely from the local workforce.
Though a few environmental advocates are opposing the prison, others have withheld judgment, saying they might be willing to accept it provided it meets all the region's tough environmental standards.
"This is a major facility that has esthetic impacts, waste-water impacts, water usage impacts," said Bernard Melewski, counsel to the Adirondack Council, a nonprofit group. "We're at the beginning of the process. This is no different from siting any other major industrial facility."
Residents who oppose the prison raise other objections. Some say they fear breakouts. Others complain that "prison glow" will ruin their gloriously starry night skies. Or that prisoners' families will move to town. Or that taxes and electric rates will rise. Or that tourists will stay away.
Some of those opponents say they have been ostracized, occasionally threatened, and had their businesses boycotted by prison advocates.
"There are a lot of people who are afraid to come forth and say they oppose it, because they fear retaliation," said Michael Trivieri, a 34-year-old logger and woodcarver.
Supporters say the prison will barely be noticed, because it will be in a forest, nearly two miles from the nearest main road. "Out of sight, out of mind," said Dean D. Lefebvre, supervisor of the Town of Altamont, which encompasses Tupper Lake, and one of the first advocates of the prison.
People like Mr. Lefebvre say opponents of the prison are a tiny but loud minority consisting mainly of out-of-town environmentalists, residents with stable government salaries, like teachers, and affluent owners of vacation homes who do not understand the struggles of unemployed loggers and small-business owners.
Settled in the mid-1800's mainly by French Canadian trappers, the town has undergone a variety of makeovers. At the turn of the century, logging dominated its economy. By the 1950's, tourism was fueling a boom, and there were 39 bars and restaurants, more than a dozen hotels, four sawmills and a vibrant shopping district.
But the 1960's were the start of a steady slide. The train line shut down. Logging companies moved away and all but one of the mills closed. The population shrank and the state became the largest employer, with about 700 workers at the Sunmount Developmental Disabilities Services Office.
The Northland Hotel is now boarded up; the 330 Lodge is a burned-out hulk. Storefronts are vacant and the weekday traffic is thin.
Most business owners in town want the prison. "Some of that money has to trickle down here," said George Kallasy, owner of the Swiss Kitchen. Asked about opposition, he said, "Some people would complain if Santa Claus gave out $10 bills."
But across the street, Joyce Vincent Moody, owner of the Adirondack Company, among the town's only upscale boutiques, says she is thinking of moving because of the prison.
"It's not what I want to see for my hometown," said Ms. Vincent Moody, 43, the mother of two. "Yes, my business is hurting; we all need something. But the only ones this will help are the Realtors, fast-food restaurants, bars, convenience stores. For the other small businesses, I don't see much coming from it."
Such comments exasperate State Senator Ronald B. Stafford, a Republican of Plattsburgh, who waged a fierce fight in the Senate to bring the prison to his district. Mr. Stafford was among the first legislators to recognize the prison industry's economic potential. Since taking office in 1966, he has brought nine into a district that already had two.
The Senator can speak from personal experience about prison town life: he grew up a stone's throw from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, where his father was a guard. "I feel fortunate to have grown up there," he said. "Prison towns are great communities."

HEADLINE: How Long Will Good Times Roll?

 BODY:
Steady growth for six and a half years. Low and steady inflation. Unemployment under 5 percent, the lowest level in decades. Productivity -- the amount of workers' output -- rising at the fastest clip in years. Stock markets soaring to dizzying heights.
The economic cheer is unrelenting. The question consuming Wall Street and Main Street is whether the good news is forever. 
 For some, 15 years of nearly uninterrupted growth portends a new world where downturns hardly exist and policy makers can chuck time-honored caution. Some corporate C.E.O.'s, union officials and financial experts call on the Federal Reserve to rev up the economy faster because, they say, the inflation dragon is extinct. But sweet dreams make for irresponsible policy. Good times will not last forever. They will end as they have in the past -- because of a major policy blunder or shock from abroad.
Economists can no more predict the timing of the next recession than they can that of the next crash on stock markets or boom on bond markets. But those who track the economy say that its structure today differs little from that of the recent past. That means the economy will continue to expand by 2 or 3 percent a year, largely reflecting increases in population and improvements in technology. That pace will not excite those who lived through the halcyon days of the 1950's and 60's, but those were years of aberrant growth following the Depression and World War II.
Recessions have interrupted growth throughout the postwar years. In nearly every case the downturn was preceded by a large and visible shock. In the 1960's the shock came from policy makers in Washington. President Johnson made the fateful decision to pay for the Vietnam War without raising taxes. Inflation soared, forcing the Federal Reserve to crack down at the end of the decade. In the 1970's, the shock came from Middle Eastern nations that drove oil prices sky-high and triggered inflation. Once again the Fed clamped down, producing years of recession and stagnation. Only in 1990 was there recession without a strong shock, though some economists believe that the small, short-lived downturn was provoked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
What distinguishes the steady growth of the 1990's from these earlier decades is not the inner workings of the economy, but rather the absence of shocks. Can good luck prevail? There are grounds for optimism. The recent budget deal, however misguided its priorities, commits Washington to paying its bills without much borrowing. Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Fed has set monetary policy on a responsible course. The country cannot fully insulate itself from imploding financial markets in Asia or the antics of Saddam Hussein. But at least the wounds will not be self-inflicted.
In the past, low and falling unemployment rates compelled workers to demand, and win, substantial wage hikes. Yet 78 months into the current recovery, wages, corrected for inflation, are rising more slowly than productivity. That is a needless blow to workers, some of whom have not enjoyed a wage hike, after accounting for inflation, since the 1970's. Fortunately, workers are likely to catch up. Over the long sweep of American experience, the more workers produce, the more they take home.
If wages rise along with productivity, corporate profits will not be affected and companies will have no need to raise prices. But wage hikes are two-edged. If they rise too rapidly, they could lead to price hikes and a Fed crackdown to control inflation, which would slow the economy and drive up unemployment. So the trade-offs built into the fabric of every market economy linger. The boldest new thing about the 90's economy is its uninterrupted luck.

HEADLINE: Party Lines Don't Define Debate: Clinton's Foes on Trade Bill Are Democrats

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The textile workers turned out in force, wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with the name of their union. Before them, on easels, colored charts tracked the United States trade imbalance with Mexico and the size of Mexican wages. And at center stage Representative David E. Bonior, the House minority floor leader, railed against the trade policies of his fellow Democrat, the President.
"The Clinton Administration is moving us in the wrong direction," the Michigan Democrat said at the "teach-in" last week in a House office building. "With a lot of talk about building bridges to the 21st century, they are dragging us backward towards 19th century conditions -- lower wages, weaker consumer protection, a dirtier environment." 
 The scene illustrated the difficult political terrain facing President Clinton as he prepared to submit legislation on Tuesday to renew his authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can approve or reject but not amend. For Democrats, the looming Congressional struggle over the so-called fast-track trade legislation is as much about the direction of the post-Clinton party as it is about trade. It is so divisive that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore both planned to argue their cases before House Democrats on Tuesday.
The dispute pits Democrats who believe the new global economy is to be embraced as the key to economic growth against those in their party who think globalization threatens to erode the living standards of American workers unless aggressively policed and managed by government.
"I know that we have often disagreed on this," Mr. Clinton told the Service Employees International Union in Washington today, "I just want to say one more time, our analysis is that between one quarter and one third of our economic growth that made 13 million jobs in the last four years came because we are selling more American products overseas."
 Vice President Al Gore and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, who is expected to challenge him for the Democratic nomination in 2000, have staked out opposing sides in the debate. And labor, bolstered by victory in the recent United Parcel Service strike, is organizing a drive against the trade initiative, including television advertisements in the districts of undecided lawmakers.
The Democratic division leaves Mr. Clinton more reliant than ever on the Republicans in Congress, who traditionally support free trade. But Republican conservatives, particularly in the House, are increasingly restive about their leaders' cooperation with Mr. Clinton, leaving Republican leaders pressed to extract favors from the President in return.
While the White House chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles, declined to comment, other White House officials said Mr. Bowles had already rebuffed one effort by Speaker Newt Gingrich to trade Republican backing for the trade legislation for Administration support for the party's position on how the 2000 Census should be conducted. Republicans want to ban the use of statistical sampling in the Census, fearful that it could count more minorities and cost them control of the House after the next reapportionment.
The last time Mr. Clinton faced the Congress on a similar trade issue, the North American Free Trade Agreement, in 1993, he won mostly with Republican votes.
But since then, control of Congress has changed hands and the makeup has changed significantly, leading to uncertain vote forecasts. "This is untested," said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which controls trade legislation. "With the freshmen and sophomores, it's unclear what their position will be."
In the House, Republican officials say that unless Mr. Clinton delivers 80 to 100 Democratic votes, they expect support for the trade measure to diminish among Republicans. Administration officials say they can win if they gain the support of 50 of the House's 206 Democrats. But they admit they are short of that.
Aware of the Democratic discontent, Mr. Clinton last week delayed introducing legislation, as his aides worked to bring over more Democrats, particularly Senator Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader. The White House hopes to use Mr. Daschle to counter Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Bonior, who are expected to be staunch opponents.
Many Democrats want Mr. Clinton to draft a proposal that links labor and environmental issues to trade pacts to prevent developing nations' gaining a competitive advantage over the United States though law wages and poor pollution controls.
But aware that such provisions, if too broadly drawn, could erode Republican and business support, the President instead will try to reassure Democrats that he address labor and environmental concerns in international tribunals, his aides said.
While business groups are poised to counter labor and fight for passage of the legislation, they say that they are waiting to see an actual bill before committing themselves.
"We will be doing TV ads later on in the month after the President submits his proposal to the Hill," said James T. Christy, vice president of government relations for the military contractor TRW Inc., "assuming the President's proposal can be embraced by our coalition."
Organized labor, however, has not been waiting, with John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., declaring last week that "the economic status of the next generation of average-wage Americans will be determined to a large extent by how our government handles trade questions in the coming months."
The unions have been issuing fliers in workplaces and organizing a "Call Congress" campaign. The Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, has started "speak-outs" against the trade legislation.
But for undecided Democrats the lobbying, such as the advertisements, threatens to put them in a vise -- torn between supporting the President who is at the peak of his popularity and supporting labor, whose financial and organizing support could be crucial in next year's Congressional elections.
One of those Democrats, Representative Nita M. Lowey of White Plains, expressed dismay at the labor movement's intent to run television commercials. "If we disagree on one issue it would be such poor judgment to target the district of a member who would be an advocate on 99 percent of the issues," she said.
Mr. Clinton's support is considered stronger in the Senate. But White House officials said they wanted to be sure they had 60 votes there, enough to break a filibuster that might come from Democrats like Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia or Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina.

The Poor Get Poorer

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Here's why Americans no longer have big families: college.
Suppose you had 12 children --
Ah, but you are laughing. "Twelve children," you are laughing. "Hah hah hah." 
 Well, you are laughing at my grandmother, and if she were here at this moment you would regret giving your laugh muscles such free play. All but 1 of her 12 were boys. A woman who has brought 11 boys to manhood does not do it by being a good sport when people laugh at her.
So suppose you had 12 children, of whom the oldest is about done with high school. You would be studying the college survey just published by U.S. News & World Report.
Having skimmed the contents, you would immediately (1) swear never to have 12 children again, and (2) tell the entire brood, "As of right now, you are all finished with school and will start tomorrow learning honest trades."
U.S. News reports that the price of sending one -- just one child! -- to college for one year -- just one year! -- is now over $20,000 at most of the flossier academies. Add $7,000 for room and board, and go figure:
Twenty-seven thousand dollars a year for four years comes to $108,000. Twelve children at $108,000 a child for four years runs to $1,296,000. Toss in inflation -- and nothing inflates faster nowadays than college costs -- and you can round the number off at $1.5 million, give or take $100,000.
That's why nobody has 12 children anymore. Having one in college is enough to keep Mom and Dad in penury until they're old enough to be wrapped in shawls and kept in rocking chairs.
If they can afford $27,000 a year for college they are probably in a tax bracket that licenses various governments to ravage maybe 50 percent of their salaries. This means they have to earn about $54,000 before taxes just for tuition and board.
That's for one child. For two, it's $108,000 a year. For three -- But let us draw the curtain. If you have tears you are probably shedding them now.
What do colleges do for this kind of money? They certify. As the United States is now organized, people not certified by colleges don't have a lot to look forward to except that blessed happiness that cannot be bought with money.
When seeking work, youth is asked by corporate interrogators, "Are you certified?" If not, alas!
The essential certifying is done by colleges of what is called "higher learning," the highest form of learning being that uncertified people don't go far. The indispensable certificates, called "diplomas," certify that recipients are persons whose parents were willing to face financial ruin in order to have their children certified.
In the past generation or two, too many people have been certified. The employment market is glutted with certified job applicants. Employers can afford to be picky.
"So you're certified, and who isn't these days?" they yawn. They have developed new criteria for weighing individual worthiness within the certified masses.
"Being certified cuts no ice here, kid," they say. "The big question is how much did the old folks pay to get the certifying done for you."
So Moms and Dads now pray that their produce will be acceptable to colleges notorious for their bankruptive tuition costs. Ivy League colossuses and many flossy but small private colleges are now well over $20,000 per annum and, considering the bullishness of the college market, likely to hit $30,000 before today's seventh-graders need certifying.
Applicants for admission to these top-dollar certifiers are so profuse that being accepted to one confers a singularity in a category with the Hope Diamond and the World Series victory of the St. Louis Browns.
Parents pining for poverty dream of having just one precious child accepted by a college that rejects 999 of every 1,000 applications.
These elegant academies, as might be expected, tend to breed killers -- corporation lawyers, merger-acquisition-and-downsizing wizards, Washington string-pullers, etc. The kind of people you don't mess with if you know what's good for you. Killers.
No wonder. After paying those killer tuitions, their parents would probably kill them if they didn't become killers.

HEADLINE: Concern Develops on Wall St. Over Wide Swings in Stocks

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
With the stock market swinging more wildly this year than it has in a long time, Billie Taylor is a bit more cautious about his investments.
Although he still has 80 percent of his money in equities, he has pulled back from the market, gently tip-toeing away from stocks. 
 "Right now I'm sitting on as high a level of cash as I've had in 10 years," said Mr. Taylor, a 57-year-old retired schoolteacher in Kettering, Ohio. "I'm somewhere on the fence because the pundits say that every time this happens the market's in for a major change."
Like millions of other investors, Mr. Taylor has been watching the increasingly sharp day-to-day moves in the stock market. Ups and downs of 1 percent or more have become commonplace in the stock market's major indexes. So far this year, such fluctuations have accounted for almost 3 of every 10 daily changes in the Dow, more than four times the pace of 1995. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks has shown the same volatility.
And the even bigger swings have been spectacular. The Dow had a 247-point, 3.1 percent, drop on Aug. 15 only to be followed two weeks later by a 257 point, 3.4 percent, rise. And while the market was calm yesterday, with the Dow slipping just 21.83 points, to 7,721.14, it had two moves of 1 percent just last week.
So even though the stocks in the Dow and the S.& P. 500 are having very good years, those 20 percent gains have been coming in an increasingly volatile environment. While this volatility has been rising from very low levels since early 1996, by many measures it is now well above average, flashing warning signals even among seasoned Wall Street strategists.
"Volatility tends to pick up when you get to turning points," said Robert Farrell, a longtime strategist at Merrill Lynch. "Occasionally, high volatility does occur in an up year without a sinister result. But a majority of your high volatility years have been down years."
To be sure, a number of Wall Street analysts remain relatively unconcerned about the increasing volatility. Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed strategist at Goldman, Sachs, argues that current volatility is still not particularly far above normal and that the economic fundamentals -- steady growth, low inflation, moderate interest rates -- remain positive and thus dampen the risk of a significant downturn.
Still, many analysts -- while not predicting that a big downturn is necessarily just over the horizon -- are growing increasingly concerned.
"Does this parallel to 1987 suggest market action will play out the same way as 10 years ago?" Gail Dudack, the chief investment strategist at UBS Securities, asked in a recent report. "Not at all. But this is a warning that should be heeded."
For investors, the increase in volatility can have two contradictory effects. It can make some nervous enough to change their outlook and their investment strategy, while others may be lulled into complacency.
On one hand, "volatility makes people think about the market again, and makes them reconsider their positions," said Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University and an expert on investor behavior. "Volatility is a clue that other people are re-evaluating, and so investors have a rule of thumb: when in doubt, imitate others."
On the other hand, increasing volatility as the market is still rising can lull investors. They may see a 200-point fall one day only as volatility that will be followed by a sharp rebound. This means it could take investors longer to see that the fundamental market direction has turned.
Some of this contradictory impact can be seen in the ebb and flow of money into stock mutual funds. Despite the rise in volatility this year, the $150 billion flow into stock funds through August is just 6.6 percent behind last year's record-setting pace and is the second highest ever. And weekly data from AMG Data Services show that in two weeks in August when volatility was high, investors withdrew more money from stock mutual funds than they put in.
One way that Wall Street analysts measure volatility is to calculate how many trading sessions register moves of more than 1 percent from one day's close to the next. By that measure, this year has been more turbulent than most.
The Dow has moved 1 percent or more in 29.2 percent, or 52, of the trading days. That is up from 16.9 percent last year and the recent lows of 6.8 percent in 1995 and 6.3 percent in 1993. And this year's performance is well above the average since 1940 of 17.2 percent, Paine Webber says.
The 29.2 percent figure so far this year is well below the most volatile years since 1940 -- 47 percent for 1974 and 38.3 percent in 1987, years when the market suffered sharp declines. But it is higher than other turbulent periods, like 1990, when investors were rattled by the Persian Gulf war and this measure of volatility jumped to 28.9 percent.
Another gauge of volatility gives more weight to larger percentage moves and measures daily movements over a rolling six months. By this measure, called standard deviation, the volatility of daily changes in the S.& P. 500 is well above the median level since 1940 of 0.72 percent. Current volatility, calculated by this measure, is 1.05 percent.
By this measure, market volatility is also well above that of the 1960's, the era most resembling today. The low-inflation environment is similar, and some analysts point to the strong market then as support for the argument that current stocks are not particularly overvalued. But in only one period -- during 1962 -- from 1957 through 1969 did volatility get as high as it is now.
Analysts offer many reasons for the higher volatility these days. Some argue that the market is jittery because of the high prices investors are now paying for stocks compared with their expected earnings potential, so that even a whiff of unexpected news about a particular company can send certain stocks reeling.
Others say it flows from a surge in computer-aided program trading, which is one reason the stock market has recently made very sharp moves at the end of the trading day.
Experts also cite the shift to allowing price changes of as little as one-sixteenth of a dollar rather than the long-standing one-eighth. And still others say that the rise in volatility is just making up for lost time from the very low volatility of 1993 and 1995.
Ms. Cohen, the bullish strategist at Goldman, Sachs, said that stocks were exceptionally undervalued through the mid-1990's, which helped hold down volatility. But as share prices rose, and stocks have became what she called "fairly valued," investors have turned edgier.
She likened the situation to shopping. "Let's say you go shopping and buy for $50 an item that's worth $100," Ms. Cohen said. "You bring it home and find it has a little ding in it. If you only paid $50 for it, you're not likely to be upset. But if you paid closer to full price, you may be a bit more agitated. That may be a good analogy for our market."
Ms. Cohen acknowledges that the market is more volatile than normal but does not know if that will continue. "What matters to me," she said, "is a fundamental turning point. And I don't see that there is a major fundamental disruption at this time."
Justin Mamis, an analyst who has been tracking and charting the market since the 1950's, suggested that the length of this bull market is starting to tear at the emotions of investors, as some are selling shares at huge profits, while others are trying to get in on the astronomical gains of their neighbors and co-workers.
But whatever the reason, there is little doubt that high volatility has usually been associated with significant turns in the market.
"Our conclusion is that the consistently high volatility, up and down, is indicative of a market in transition," usually downward, said Steven Leuthold, head of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
Tim Hayes, senior equity strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla., says volatility "tends to move from relatively low levels before market peaks to relatively high levels after market peaks."
Still, some strategists, like Mr. Farrell at Merrill Lynch, are not sure what to make of this period. "I would treat it as a caution flag," he said, "without implying it's 1929."
Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School, warns that one of the biggest dangers in the current rise in volatility is that it can whipsaw investors into making bad decisions with their money.
"Volatility is harmful," he said, "if you let it affect your psyche and your long-term goals."
As for Mr. Taylor, the retired teacher, he is content to just wait on the sidelines and let the market run its course. "Sometimes, my Daddy used to say, you need to just lay back in the weeds and wait a while. And that's just what I'm doing."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE CANDIDATES;
No Shortage of Criticism, But Little for Each Other

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
With no idea whether they will actually face each other in a runoff next week, Ruth W. Messinger and the Rev. Al Sharpton nonetheless sat down for a courtly televised debate last night as if the contest was still on, displaying the occasional flash of disagreement but generally concurring with each other's criticism of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
For the most part, the two Democrats resisted requests by three questioners that they point out their differences and criticize each other. Sitting in the auditorium of St. Francis College in downtown Brooklyn, they said they would not submit to the divisive suggestion of Mr. Giuliani that they spend their time attacking each other. 
 "I take the people that got up and came out and voted for me too seriously to let this degrade into some schoolyard thing of Ruth attack Al, Al attack Ruth," Mr. Sharpton said in his opening statement. "It's about education, unemployment, mass transit, affordable housing, it's not about, Rudy, you dictating a schoolyard fight."
Ms. Messinger agreed that the runoff campaign should not be forced into "name calling and finger pointing."
"I ask Reverend Sharpton not to take the bait, to rise above the Mayor's attempt to divide," she said. "I am not a divider. My whole life has been about bringing people together to solve common problems, to work toward common goals."
The discussion virtually ignored the question that dominated New York political circles yesterday: whether, in fact, there would even be a runoff. Only in response to the first question of the forum did the candidates touch on the possibility that this might be their only head-to-head encounter.
While refusing to say whether he would challenge the results of a recount in court, Mr. Sharpton warned that many voters would take a cynical view of the process if the runoff was canceled. Ms. Messinger declined to discuss the possibility until the tally was completed.
With some coaxing, the candidates did come up with several areas where they parted ways. Without the slightest trace of rancor in her voice, Ms. Messinger said she disagreed with Mr. Sharpton's handling of the Tawana Brawley case in 1987, as well as his refusal to denounce Louis Farrakhan. She also criticized his proposals to raise the city's commuter tax, and his decision not to seek greater productivity gains from the municipal unions.
In turn, Mr. Sharpton said she was wrong to try to balance the budget on the backs of union workers, and said it was important to make commuters pay their share of the city's upkeep. He also said Ms. Messinger should have endorsed the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition in 1988, a year in which she backed Gov. Michael Dukakis for president.
But even their differences were presented in an amiable way. To applause and laughter from the audience -- largely made up of Sharpton supporters -- Ms. Messinger said her main difference was obvious: "I'm taller." Mr. Sharpton predicted that anything short of a fistfight would produce press accounts of their refusal to square off.
A final 20-minute segment in which the two candidates could question each other was dominated by softballs lobbed back and forth: Do you see the Mayor as a divider and a bully, as I do, Ms. Messinger asked, and her opponent quickly agreed. Do you agree that the Mayor has not laid out a plan to deal with record unemployment, Mr. Sharpton asked. Sure enough, Ms. Messinger could not have agreed more.
Mr. Sharpton dismissed Mr. Giuliani's description of him as unqualified by saying the Mayor had no right to criticize his tax problems when the Giuliani campaign itself has been hit by charges of widespread violations of campaign finance laws. Ms. Messinger said that while she considered Mr. Sharpton qualified to run for mayor, she believed her 20 years in government made her the most qualified candidate.

HEADLINE: Whitman Shifts Focus From Car Insurance to Record on Other Issues

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
After six weeks of making automobile insurance the focal point of her re-election campaign, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is now seeking to move the campaign debate onto other issues and away from the one subject that some advisers believe makes her vulnerable to her Democratic challenger.
In what her aides describe as a new phase of her campaign, Governor Whitman is no longer speaking on the campaign trail almost exclusively about high auto insurance rates. In the last week, she has attended campaign events organized to highlight her record on education and crime. And her campaign today presented its first television advertising spot for the general election, and it does not mention insurance. 
 Until now, campaign aides to State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democratic nominee, have said Mrs. Whitman has made it easy for them to focus attention on auto insurance, the one issue that both Republicans and Democrats believe could hurt Mrs. Whitman's candidacy and strengthen Mr. McGreevey's election bid.
Polls show that auto insurance is the most important issue to voters in this race and that the majority of voters do not believe that Mrs. Whitman has done enough to reduce their premiums, which are the highest in the nation.
In the Whitman campaign's new 30-second television spot, Mrs. Whitman is pictured at upbeat, crowded campaign rallies with police officers and union members as an announcer extols her administration's record, saying she has succeeded in cutting taxes, strengthening the economy, reducing crime and putting welfare recipients to work. The campaign will begin broadcasting the advertisement on television stations in New York, Philadelphia and Atlantic City beginning Wednesday.
As Election Day approaches, the Governor's campaign aides said that they had intended all along to move the campaign debate away from auto insurance and onto the Governor's broader record, which they believe will persuade voters to give Mrs. Whitman a second term.
Tom Wilson, the Governor's campaign manager, said the advertisement was created to remind voters about Mrs. Whitman's record and to tell them that the state is moving in the right direction under the Whitman administration. "The Governor has a great story to tell," Mr. Wilson said. "She has a lot of good things to talk about, and we want to keep talking about them."
Over the objections of some of her political consultants, Governor Whitman spent much of the summer, and until just recently, talking almost exclusively about the state's auto insurance problem while campaigning. Her campaign aides worried that she was spending too much time discussing an issue that voters believe she has not handled properly. But Mrs. Whitman disagreed. She contends that it would be a bigger mistake to ignore the voters' top concern in this campaign.
Mr. Wilson said that Mrs. Whitman would continue to address the problem of auto insurance but that the campaign intended also to focus on other issues of concern to voters, like crime, taxes and education.
Mrs. Whitman's decision to stress auto insurance this summer was welcomed by Mr. McGreevey, whose campaign has tried to tap into voter anger over high premiums. His staff criticized the Governor today for trying to move the focus away from the issue that polls show most voters cite as their top concern.
Steven Salmore, a professor at Rutgers University and a Republican political consultant, said that Mrs. Whitman's decision to move away from the issue will cause difficulties for Mr. McGreevey.
"I have a strong feeling that he has lost his opportunity to define this race," Mr. Salmore said. "It is going to be very difficult for him to recover now that the media campaign has begun. He had to come up with a compelling reason to throw her out of office. He picked auto insurance. The question is what is next."
But Mr. McGreevey's campaign aides insist that voter concern over auto insurance is not going to go away.
"She is talking about issues that are outside the Governor's control, such as the national economy and national trends in crime and welfare," said Richard McGrath, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey. "She is trying to hide from her failed record on auto insurance, property taxes and education."
Mr. McGreevey, who is lagging behind the Governor's fund-raising efforts, expects to begin his television advertising campaign next week. Both candidates expect to spend about $5 million on television advertising in the coming weeks to reach New Jersey voters.
New Jersey voters can also expect to see television advertising from Murray Sabrin, the Libertarian Party's gubernatorial nominee. Mr. Sabrin, a college professor, said he had raised $236,000 for his campaign.
The State Election Law Enforcement Commission postponed a decision tonight on whether to grant matching taxpayer funds for Mr. Sabrin's campaign. Gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey who raise at least $210,000 are eligible to participate in the state program. If the commission approves Mr. Sabrin's request, he will also be able to join Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey at two televised debates.

HEADLINE: Fight Over Nomination Clearly Shows Rifts in G.O.P.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
In their final showdown on Capitol Hill last week, Senator Jesse Helms accused William F. Weld, the former Governor of Massachusetts, of threatening to "begin a war within the Republican Party." Today, Mr. Weld, the non-Ambassador, welcomed the battle, declaring, "To the extent that people are looking at Jesse Helms as the face of the Republican Party, I think that carries a certain amount of freight with it."
The moment, in fact, is more like one combative day in the Thirty Years' War or the Hundred Years' War than Pearl Harbor or Fort Sumter. The ideological war in the Republican Party dates back more than three decades, to 1964, when Barry Goldwater won the Republican Presidential nomination. 
 The spectacle of Mr. Weld's doomed quest to win an ambassadorship to Mexico was one of the most theatrical displays of these deep hostilities. The Helms-Weld fight demonstrated -- as did the coup attempt against Speaker Newt Gingrich earlier this summer -- that the party that was so successful as the opposition is still struggling to adjust to its role as the Congressional majority, and to the reality of a Democrat in the White House.
Their personal collision reflected successful efforts by Mr. Weld and Mr. Helms to use each other to raise their profiles in the party. In quashing the Weld nomination, Mr. Helms asserted his power in the Senate and was cheered by the social conservatives.
By standing up to Mr. Helms, Mr. Weld became a hero for Republicans who are conservative on economic issues but more liberal on social matters like abortion. The ease and humor with which Mr. Weld carried himself and his terse, punchy answers in the news conference today were reminiscent of the banter with reporters of another son of Massachusetts, President John F. Kennedy, and may help Mr. Weld set himself apart from other moderates willing to jump into a field of right-wing Presidential contenders in 2000.
In blocking Mr. Weld's move to Mexico City, Mr. Helms may have inadvertently helped Mr. Weld remain active in Republican politics. As Mr. Weld said in an interview days before he resigned the Governorship in July, "If I get the nomination, obviously it takes me out of national politics."
That, of course, is no longer a possibility. Indeed, at times today, Mr. Weld sounded almost as if he were trying out lines for the stump. He said that Republicans should "get Government back to doing what it does best: defending public safety, educating the citizenry and helping those who cannot help themselves." (It was probably not lost on potential rivals that in the news conference, Mr. Weld emphasized his anti-Washington bona fides, saying more than once, "Washington sure is a funny town.")
"This made him national," said Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's former political strategist, who has also advised Mr. Weld and Mr. Helms. "He can't win the party's Presidential nomination, but he can be the leader of the political faction" of liberal Republicans.
But many Republican loyalists discount Mr. Weld's national potential, saying they were unnerved to see a prominent Republican standing at a lectern with a White House seal as he ridiculed Mr. Helms -- and spoke warmly of the Democratic President who nominated him.
"I really think he's marginalized himself," said Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's unsuccessful Presidential campaign last year. "He stuck it in the eyes of conservatives all over the country, and he has helped Clinton more than he has helped the Republican Party."
Senator Sam Brownback, a freshman Republican from Kansas and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who had urged Mr. Helms to give Mr. Weld's nomination a hearing, said: "It raises Weld's name and it raises his profile. But you do that at the expense of making other people very irritated."
Whatever the fallout for Mr. Weld, the drama over his nomination left the Republican Party looking particularly weak, with fractures that go far beyond ideological differences.
"A number of Republicans still don't know what it means to be in the majority," said Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, a moderate Republican. "They still think they're in the minority. And being in the minority means just blowing up the place." That is not only the view of a lone moderate; Mr. Gingrich has made a similar observation.
Many Republican lawmakers said they were particularly concerned that, with Mr. Gingrich's wounded image and the failure of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, to become a commanding figure, the party is floundering and unable to find consensus on an agenda of issues. These lawmakers said they were increasingly worried about these conflicts as the midterm elections approach next year.
The predicament was on display at the Christian Coalition convention in Atlanta last weekend, where the lack of a party line was obvious. Some Republican speakers condemned the party's leaders in Congress for working too closely with the White House, while others, like Mr. Gingrich, congratulated themselves for pressing Mr. Clinton into signing a tax-cutting package.
"The leadership has allowed a vacuum to occur where we don't stand for anything," said Representative David McIntosh, a conservative from Indiana. "If we don't solve it by the 1998 election, then we're likely to lose the majority in Congress. The polls show everybody still likes incumbents in Congress, but our base is very depressed."
Ralph Reed, who recently left the Christian Coalition to become a political strategist, warned party leaders in a memorandum that the way for the party to recover was not to simply attack Mr. Clinton.
"Republicans have sometimes acted as if the road back for them is paved with scandals and Congressional inquiries," Mr. Reed wrote.
"This is a mirage. Instead, Republican candidates should treat Clinton's popularity for what it is: an amorphous political phenomenon created by forces beyond our immediate control," he said.
But for other Republicans, their party's challenge boils down to the two men in the spotlight today and finding a home where both Jesse Helms and Bill Weld can co-exist. "The Republican Party must be big enough for Jesse Helms and William Weld if we're serious about competing in national affairs," said Senator Robert C. Smith, a conservative from New Hampshire. "And I believe it is big enough for that."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on Tuesday about William F. Weld misattributed a quotation about the future of the Republican Party. It was Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, not Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire, who said: "The Republican Party must be big enough for Jesse Helms and William Weld if we're serious about competing in national affairs. And I believe it is big enough for that."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk;
Bordeaux Again Leads a High-Price Parade

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THE official date set for picking white grapes in Bordeaux this year was a remarkably early Aug. 25; mid-September is more the norm for all grapes. But the crop was so precocious that picking in the Graves region, a major source for white Bordeaux wine, began on Aug. 18. The early harvest reflects the magnificence of this year's growing season, which means the grapes and the wine should be superb.
Historians have had to go back more than a century to find an earlier date. Not since 1893, when the harvest began on Aug. 15, had the picking begun so early. Dates for the red grapes this year were early, too: Sept. 3 for merlot and Sept. 8 for cabernet sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties. There have been years when most picking was done in October. 
 It was an auspicious start to what could be a memorable season for wine. And not just in Bordeaux. Early harvests were the rule all over France, most of Italy enjoyed good growing weather and, despite rain damage in August in some areas, California is harvesting a bumper crop.
These are happy days in wine country. Prices are high, order books are full and figures show that the consumption of good wine is continuing to grow. Prices for futures for the 1996 Bordeaux vintage, announced earlier this year, are in the $300-a-bottle range for wines like Petrus and Chateau Ausone. And some current Burgundy prices are even higher, with Domaine de la Romanee-Conti reaching $600 and more.
California wines like Robert Mondavi Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Case 23 sell readily for $75, Caymus Vineyards Special Reserve goes for $100, and the rare Diamond Creek Lake Vineyard Cabernet sells out in European markets for $250, says the winery owner, Al Brounstein.
These ultra-premium wines account for only a tiny portion of the wine market, but they reflect a trend toward more expensive wines, a trend that indicates American wine drinkers are coming of age.
The numbers for California wines show what's happening. Sales of varietal table wines -- wine named for the grape from which they are made -- were up almost 11 percent from 1996, according to Impact, a trade publication. This continued a trend begun in the mid-1980's. In 1985, the industry shipped 20 million cases of varietal wines; last year the figure was 77.4 million.
To that must be added 31.5 million cases of imported table wines, much of it meant to cover demand that domestic production, most of it from California, was unable to meet. California vineyards are still recovering from an epidemic of phylloxera, a vine-destroying insect, which has forced the replanting of thousands of acres of wine grapes.
Further illustrating the change in America's wine-drinking tastes is the continuing decline in interest for inexpensive generic wines. In 1985, some 85.7 million cases of California generics, mostly jug wines, where shipped; last year, the figure was 52.5 million cases.
The long-ignored bag-in-the-box wines have given considerable support to the generic category in recent years. They have made substantial inroads in the traditional market for three- and four-liter glass jugs. Each rectangular box holds an airtight plastic bag usually filled with five liters of wine. As the wine is poured through a built-in spigot, the bag collapses, keeping the wine free from air. Five liters is the equivalent of almost seven bottles of wine. Some boxed wines have crossed into the varietal group, holding inexpensive chardonnay and other wines.
Most varietal wines, however, sell far more than all but a handful of the generics. In 1996, the retail value of chardonnay sold in this country topped that of all generic wines combined, according to Impact.
Even if the wine producer is thrilled by high prices, most wine is inordinately expensive from the consumer's point of view -- and not just for famous French wines. It may well be that most American wine drinkers have seen the last of the Bordeaux First Growths and Burgundy Grand Crus -- at least until the economic boom in the Far East slows down.
Call any Bordeaux chateau owner or head of a famous Burgundy domaine, and he or she will probably be traveling in Asia. And selling wine. Some American wine collectors are finding themselves forced to sell their Lafites and Moutons, even when they acquired them years ago at reasonable prices. They find it difficult to drink a bottle of wine that can be sold at auction for $350. Top-of-the-line American wines are unlikely to come down in price, even when grapes are more plentiful, because most of them are deliberately made in small quantities and will never match the demand for them.
What will happen to moderately priced varietals remains to be seen. Many wines that were priced at $8 a few years ago are $12, and the $12 wines are $18 or $20. For all but a small group of consumers, $20 is too much for a bottle of wine for dinner at home. A moderating factor is that discount retailers in this city and elsewhere, generally, even in a time of wine shortages, pare 10 percent or more off suggested retail prices.
Since the overall market for wine is growing much more slowly than the industry would like, there is reason to hope that as grapes become more plentiful in a few years, competition will drive prices of many wines down to more acceptable levels. Thousands of acres of new vines have been planted in California to replace those destroyed by phylloxera, and many wineries are developing vineyards overseas, both on their own and in joint ventures.
But as for now, there is no shortage of little-known and underhyped wines that sell at attractive prices and are equal to wines at twice the cost. The search is unending; it's also fun.
 
Tastings
From Australia, A Special Cabernet
 
PENFOLDS Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon 1993, South Australia. About $45. Penfolds bills this rich, luxuriously concentrated wine as the cabernet equivalent to its Grange, Australia's best-known wine. Bin 707 is a blend of fruit from vineyards in Coonawarra, Padthaway and Adelaide Hills. It was first made in 1964, but was discontinued in 1969 because of a shortage of the highest quality cabernet. Since it was brought back in 1976, there has been a 707 every year except for 1981, when the fruit was considered too light. Fermentation is finished in American oak, and the wine is aged in barrels for 16 months. It can be kept in a cellar for a decade.

HEADLINE: Inflation Continues Slow Crawl, U.S. Says

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Consumer prices edged up a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in August, while factories increased output at the fastest rate in nine months, the Government said today in separate reports.
The reports were the latest signs that the economy continues to grow at a robust pace with low inflation. Stocks and bonds rose after the reports, as investors reasoned that the data would allow the Federal Reserve Board to hold interest rates steady when its policy makers meet on Sept. 30. 
 "What we seem to have is a situation where the good times keep rolling," said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant to the Northern Trust Corporation in Chicago. "Production growth is vigorous, and inflation is tame. You can't get much better than that."
The rise in consumer prices, below the gain of three-tenths of 1 percent that Wall Street economists had expected, was viewed as especially benign in light of the economy's overall strength and surging gasoline prices. The rise of two-tenths of a percent in the Consumer Price Index matched the gain in July.
Consumer prices have risen at a 1.6 percent annual rate for the first eight months of the year -- less than half the 3.3 percent increase in 1996. For the last 12 months, prices have risen at a 2.2 percent rate.
In its report, the Labor Department said gasoline prices jumped 5.4 percent last month while food prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Those gains were partly offset by a 1 percent drop in clothing prices as shoppers bought more discounted spring and summer merchandise.
Consumers will probably buy more expensive fall clothing soon, reversing that decline next month, Patrick Jackman, an economist with the Labor Department, said.
Excluding the often volatile categories of food and energy prices, the so-called core rate of inflation inched up one-tenth of 1 percent, down from a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in July. The core rate has also risen at a 2.2 percent annual rate for the last 12 months; if the pace continues, the core rate for 1997 could be the lowest in more than 30 years.
"It's a very comfortable number for the inflation outlook and certainly fits with no Fed activity in terms of policy on Sept. 30," said Kathleen Stephansen, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York.
A separate report from the Federal Reserve said factory output rose seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, pointing to brisk growth with few signs that the economy was overheating after more than six years of expansion. Industrial output grew nearly twice as fast as July's increase of four-tenths of 1 percent. Factories ran at 83.9 percent of capacity last month, the highest rate since September 1995 and up from 83.6 percent in July.
While economists welcomed the inflation data, many said the unexpectedly strong rise in manufacturing output suggested that the economic slowdown anticipated by the Fed seemed unlikely to occur in the third quarter.
That left some wondering how long the rosy situation would last. The economy grew at a 4.9 percent rate in the first quarter and a 3.6 percent pace in the second quarter, rates that economists traditionally believed would fuel inflation.
James E. Annable, chief economist at First Chicago NBD bank, said that if factory output rose so that businesses started using too much spare capacity, they might be forced to raise prices.
"That has not happened yet," he said. "One of the reasons that inflation has been so low is that capacity utilization rates have been historically low."
But a report from the Commerce Department suggested that growth could still moderate later this year. The department said business inventories rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July, slower than June's rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent and the seventh consecutive monthly gain.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Mark As German Rate Isn't Raised

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher against the German mark yesterday after the Bundesbank left a crucial interest rate unchanged and an official at the central bank suggested that a weak mark would not automatically lead to a German rate increase.
The dollar also strengthened against the yen, benefiting from the mark's strength against the Japanese currency. 
 Surging stocks and bonds in the United States gave the dollar a push higher in late trading. The United States markets rose on benign inflation data, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 2.26 percent on the day.
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 1.7700 marks, up from 1.7629 marks on Monday. The dollar rose to 121.25 yen from 120.31 yen. The pound slipped to $1.5954 from $1.6051.
The dollar begin its climb against the mark in overseas trading after the Bundesbank, as expected, left its securities repurchase rate steady at 3 percent.
The dollar added to its gains on news that a Bundesbank council member, Franz-Christophe Zeitler, had said in an interview with a German magazine, Borse Online, that the central bank would not automatically raise interest rates if the dollar climbed toward 2 marks.
"Important for me is less the level, rather the period of time in which the movement took place," Mr. Zeitler said.
Despite the decision by the Bundesbank to leave interest rates unchanged, many currency traders say they expect it will raise rates later this year.
Indeed, the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, on Monday hinted at a rate increase before next spring.
"Talk of German interest rates going up continues to put a cap on the dollar in the short run, anyway," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange economist at the Bank of Montreal.
By contrast, investor confidence in the Japanese economy and financial markets continues to deteriorate. For this reason, aggressive purchases of mark for yen continued today, and that was the primary reason the dollar showed gains against the yen.
"The turn everyone thought was coming in Japan's economy is apparently not coming at the moment," said Benjamin Strauss, vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Julius Baer.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Tight Market Reveals 'Hidden Space'

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
As if by magic, some of Manhattan's invisible office space is starting to come into view.
Actually, magic has nothing to do with it. Brokers and other real estate executives say that as vacancy rates drop and rents rise, many prospective tenants are seeking to line up deals for office space as much as several years before their existing lease expires and the same space officially goes on the market. 
 But some landlords still appear to be holding space off the market to avoid committing to leases at current rates, in the hope that rates will be sharply higher in the near future.
In a recent report on the state of the office market, Newmark & Company Real Estate noted that McGraw-Hill was scheduled to move into space in 2 Penn Plaza, at 33d Street and Seventh Avenue. The transaction, it noted, "reveals the importance of 'hidden space'; the floors to be occupied by McGraw-Hill at 2 Penn Plaza encompass over 300,000 square feet that was never placed on the market."
James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark, said the strength of the market allowed Vornado Realty Trust, which owns the building, to secure a new tenant before the old lease expired without the expense of a marketing campaign or a major renovation. "In the early 1980's I was doing as-is deals all the time," he said. "This is the first point in the current cycle where it is easy for landlords to do this sort of thing."
Peter R. Friedman, chairman of the brokerage company bearing his name, said that during the early 1990's, when many corporations reduced their work forces, they faced a quandary about what to do with the excess space, particularly if the lease had only five or six years to run. To attract a new tenant in that recessionary time, the company would have had to offer at least one year of free rent, while being forced to pay brokerage commissions and for remodeling work.
"The reason a lot of this space was held off the market is that it was economically unmarketable," Mr. Friedman said.
For example, the advertising agency holding company WPP Group had 3 million square feet of space in New York, while only needing 2 million, he said. "Only in the last 24 months has it made any sense to try to market that space."
Julien J. Studley, chairman of a brokerage firm bearing his name, said, "A lot of corporations carried excess space because they did not want to take a hit on their books" by taking a financial loss on a sublease. "As the rental value increases," he said, "that space will come to market."
Mr. Studley said some of the office space that was invisible even to real estate specialists would be vacated when new development took place. As an example, he cited the old Alexander's department store at 58th Street and Lexington Avenue. "Everybody knows the Alexander's site will be developed," Mr. Studley said. "It will support 1.5 million square feet of retail, office and apartments." He predicted that most of the commercial tenants would move from elsewhere in the city.
Another form of hidden space is in buildings that are not suitable for marketing, he said. "There is the Chrysler Building and 666 Third Avenue," Mr. Studley said. "One is empty and the other is half empty and both need renovation. But they are in good locations and they will come back to the market."
In spite of the improving market, some space is being withheld for speculative reasons, brokers say. "Space is being warehoused by landlords in hopes that the market will tighten more and they will have a precious commodity in the near future," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage that represents tenants.
As an example, he cited the building at 600 Fifth Avenue, which is part of Rockefeller Center. Officially, he said, about 71,000 square feet of space on the upper floors is on the market. But, he said, there is 190,000 square feet of contiguous space on the second to ninth floors that will become available at the end of 2000. "Why is that not on the market?" he asked. "I guess the attitude is that they can get $35 to $40 a square foot in the building now, but by the end of 2000 it will be worth $50 a foot."
The existence of hidden space, both known and unknown, means that vacancy statistics are at best an approximation, real estate executives say. "Whenever brokerage companies quote vacancy rates they are different because there is no accepted industry standard or benchmark," said Paul N. Glickman, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield.
He said that because of the tightening market, brokers are working in advance to identify what space will become available and to prepare to market it when it does. "We are working with 133,000 square feet of space at 99 Park Avenue," Mr. Glickman said, referring to a building on Park Avenue between 39th and 40th Streets. "It becomes available in the second quarter of 1999 and we are very quietly beginning to market it. Six months ago that was hidden space."

HEADLINE: 'Fast Track' Issue Deserves Fast Action

BYLINE: By Bob Dole and Lloyd Bentsen; Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican Presidential nominee, is the former Senate majority leader. Lloyd Bentsen, the former Treasury Secretary, is a former Democratic Senator from Texas.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
During more than two decades of divided government, Democrats and Republicans have often set aside their differences to take collective action on matters promoting our nation's interests beyond its borders. The next issue that calls for bipartisan leadership is the passage of legislation granting the President "fast track" authority -- a contract between the executive and legislative branches in which the President can negotiate trade deals knowing that the results will receive an up or down vote, without amendments, in return for a commitment that the Administration will consult Congress in the negotiations.
As Senate colleagues from different political parties, we joined in voting to give fast-track authority to every President from Gerald Ford to George Bush. Today, as law firm colleagues, we agree that Congress and the Administration must set aside partisan differences to grant President Clinton this same authority. The United States must act now to take advantage of our status as the most competitive economy in the world to insure our future prosperity. To do that, Congress must decide to compete, not retreat. 
 The United States is, once again, the world's largest exporter. Our current seven-year period of sustained growth, with extraordinarily low unemployment, has been fueled in large part by international trade. More than a quarter of our economic growth and more than 10 million jobs are the direct result of trade.
Without passage of fast-track legislation, however, our success in selling American products to the world will be at risk. Inaction carries a very high price. Although we are currently well positioned to compete, other countries have recently been negotiating trade agreements that will allow them to move ahead of us into developing markets -- even in our own backyard in Latin America.
Since 1992, 20 free trade pacts have been negotiated in Latin America and Asia that exclude the United States. China, for example, has aimed at Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela as "strategic priorities" to develop bilateral trade.
Fast-track authority will allow President Clinton to negotiate agreements to break down trade barriers in areas where the United States is most competitive, like agriculture, telecommunications, financial services and medical equipment. It will allow us to retain our leadership in exports by focusing on developing economies, where the bulk of international growth will occur in coming years.
The coalition that passed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade must come together again to pass a fast-track bill this fall. If legislation does not pass in short order, next year's contentious elections may delay passage until the 106th Congress -- and 1999 may be too late. If we don't act quickly to shore up trade relationships in Latin America and Asia, other countries will.
Passage of fast-track legislation is critical to insure that our economy continues to grow at its present rate. In fact, the success of this year's budget agreement depends on maintaining steady growth. As much as any other issue, the fate of the fast-track bill in 1997 will determine whether our budget balances in 2002.
While we are the world's largest exporter, we also continue to import more than we export. The best way to shrink the resulting trade deficit is to persuade other countries to eliminate their trade barriers, enabling us to export even more goods, services and agricultural products. That, in turn, will create more and better-paying American jobs.
Given the public's general ambivalence about trade matters, it would be easy for either party to try to score political points by criticizing responsible proponents of free and fair trade. Criticism is easy. Leadership requires hard work. Our leaders must step forward, now, to do what is right for America's future.

HEADLINE: End of Chicago's Education School Stirs Debate

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 16

 BODY:
As the campus's shaded quadrangles fill with students for the start of the fall quarter -- hints of red dappling the ivy that climbs the neo-Gothic buildings, yellow self-move trucks rumbling along the streets -- there is a void at the University of Chicago this year: For the first time in more than a century there are no doctoral candidates entering the department of education.
The department, founded in 1895 by John Dewey, and once home to Bruno Bettelheim and William S. Gray, creator of the "Dick and Jane" early reader series, has been shut down, its remaining faculty and students told that they have until 2001 to finish and move on. The administrators who closed it argued that its scholarship was unworthy of Chicago's standards in the social sciences, a failing they deemed too costly to correct. 
 At a time when education is edging to the center of the American domestic agenda, the demise of such a pedigreed department has engendered much anger. After the faculty of the division of social sciences voted last November to endorse the recommendation of Dean Richard P. Saller that the department be closed, he and other administrators were barraged with hundreds of letters and petitions from around the country, some accusing them of apathy toward the fate of the nation's schoolchildren.
A common version of the events leading to the decision asserted that the money men, the bean counters, had taken over Chicago, found its education department -- with its modest-earning alumni -- wanting, and chose to kill it off.
"It was portrayed as a battle between good and evil," Professor Saller, a Roman historian who became dean of social sciences in 1994, lamented. "I got all kinds of hate mail."
But in recent months, a more complex discussion has emerged, one which raises questions about the nature of educational research, notably about the links between educational theory and practice, and how they fit into a traditional academic setting. Increasingly, insiders and outsiders are contending that the decline started in the late 70's, when Chicago's education department stopped its day-to-day involvement with teacher training and schools, devoting itself more purely to theory.
"A department of education which terminates all ties to the real world of schooling and focuses only on statistical manipulation of schooling outcomes is getting itself in trouble," said Bert Cohler, a professor of psychology and education here. "We became more and more ivory-towered in the worst sense."
Ivory tower is not generally a dirty phrase at Chicago, an institution that prides itself on offering a kind of cloistered devotion to knowledge. A higher percentage of Chicago graduates go into academia than those of comparable schools, such as Yale and Stanford, and its graduate departments of such disciplines as economics and anthropology are widely viewed as among the very best.
But education has always been a special case, a hybrid field that depends on a give-and-take with ordinary people teaching youngsters how to make sense of squiggles on a page and the world around. On this score, the department's fate is a something of a cruel paradox, because Dewey himself made much of applied research, founding the university's laboratory school where he tested and developed his theories of education and child psychology.
He assailed education that separated school and life and made his mark by rejecting the predominant pedagogy of his day, which involved rote learning rather than learning through experience, now the prevailing pedagogy.
His well-known laboratory school remains on campus but it has evolved into a good private school with few direct links to the university.
Until the 1970's, the University of Chicago had a strong commitment to education. In addition to the department, there was a Graduate School of Education devoted to teacher training, with strong links to the laboratory school both for teacher instruction and research projects.
Philip W. Jackson, who in the 1970's was head of the laboratory school, dean of the graduate school and chairman of the department, said he had 40 full-time faculty members under him with programs financed by the Ford Foundation and other major endowments reaching as far afield as Pakistan and South America.
But in the late 1970's, two things happened: The focus on education shifted away from schools, and research money dried up.
Chicago closed its graduate school of education and consolidated it within the graduate department that was part of the division of social sciences. Several Ph.D. candidates transferred out, and the number of faculty members began to diminish and age -- there were only 15 last year, with 12 of them over age 60 -- and the focus shifted to bring it more in line with traditional social science. Apart from the continuation of small Master of Arts of Teaching programs in the departments of English and mathematics, links with the laboratory school were severed.
Prof. Patricia Albjerg Graham of Harvard, the former dean of the Harvard's Graduate School of Education, said that Chicago's withdrawal from teacher training in the 1970's was not unusual because the dominant intellectual model in education then held that schools themselves had relatively little influence on youngsters.
"Schools of education moved away from schooling," she said. "Harvard stopped training teachers in 1974, so for Chicago to close its school was, in some ways, very understandable. The difference was that once that happened and they found themselves in the social sciences, they couldn't realign their priorities when things changed again. Harvard went back to teacher training in 1983 and now we do loads of it."
But money and prestige played roles in the fate of Chicago's department as well. Professor Jackson, who called this an enormously painful subject for him, said, "Like law and medicine, education looks outward to some world of practice and is plagued by this dual role of serving two masters."
"But law and medicine," he continued, "have extremely wealthy alumni which education does not have. It's very unusual for a university to say, 'Let's get rid of medicine or law.' But getting rid of education can be done."
A number of top universities, including Yale and Johns Hopkins, have dropped schools or departments of education over the years, he said, partly over financing and partly because they did not fit in with classic models of academic research. While Chicago held on, the department found itself increasingly unable to get money for new appointments since education research often appeared to lack rigor in the eyes of the university administrators who controlled the money.
Dean Saller said that when he took over the social sciences division, he was troubled by the frequent lack of peer review for publication in education and the way in which government agencies or foundations sometimes set the research agenda by financing their own pet projects rather than the ideas generated by scholars themselves. He noted that some 20 percent of the Ph.D.'s earned in America are in education, yet the field has failed to live up to its promise.
"Of course I care about public education," Dean Saller said. "My children are in public schools. But we can't let a sentimental concern for children get in the way of hard scrutiny about whether we are producing quality work."
Critics of the department's closing maintain that while the department was declining over 20 years, the administration failed to step in until it was too late.
A university committee has been working since the spring on recommending a future for educational research and teacher training here and some hope that the department can be revived. But the committee's chairman, W. Clark Gilpin, dean of the divinity school, said there was no chance of this, though an interdisciplinary center might be formed to link what he and other administrators said were pockets of fine educational research in other departments and to continue teacher training programs in English and math.
Others, noting that the university finds itself surrounded by a large and troubled public school system, argued that the department had been salvageable. The failure to save it, they say, reflects a lack of commitment to what should be a vital university mission, especially at this moment in American history, even if it requires an adjustment of standards to reflect the messy nature of educational research.
"I consider it a major mistake when a university such as this one cancels its education department," said Wayne C. Booth, a retired English professor and distinguished literary critic. "It should be struggling to restore what was once the best department in the world."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
American Express expects travel costs to continue rising next year, but at a less torrid pace.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES experiencing sticker shock from constantly escalating travel costs can expect more of the same next year, though there are signs the increases are beginning to taper off.
In a 1998 business travel forecast released this week, American Express predicts overall travel costs will jump 3 percent to 5 percent next year, compared with an expected 7 percent to 8 percent increase this year. 
 Air fares -- which American Express says represent 42 percent of an average company's travel and entertainment costs -- are projected to rise 5 percent to 6 percent in 1998 over 1997 levels, which are the highest ever. This year, according to American Express, the typical business air fare -- a full fare or fare with few purchase requirements -- will climb at least 15 percent; through July it was up 23 percent. American Express attributes any increases next year to upward pressure on airlines' labor costs; it expects carriers' capacity growth to be a minimal 3.5 percent, with demand growing similarly.
Hotel costs, which American Express says total 21 percent of travel expenses, are projected to climb 4 percent to 5 percent in 1998, half the rate of increase expected this year. The company predicts 1998 hotel occupancies will fall "slightly below expected 1997 levels, (but) nonetheless remain at historically high levels." Room supply is expected to increase in 1998, outpacing demand.
American Express is also forecasting a smaller increase in 1998 over 1997 in car rental costs, which constitute 8 percent of total travel expenses; the company says rates will rise 5 percent to 6 percent, compared with 4 percent to 7 percent in the first half of this year. It says dining costs, 14 percent of total travel expenses, will climb 2 percent to 3 percent, the same as this year.
The Air Transport Association, the trade group for the United States airline industry, has confirmed what many business travelers have uncomfortably suspected for months: carriers are flying an all-time high number of passengers. According to statistics announced by the association last week, a record 69.3 percent of seats on planes were occupied by paying passengers in 1996; this year the figure-- known as the load factor -- is one percentage point higher. Load factors 15 years ago were below 60 percent.
One bright spot ahead, according to the association's chief economist, David Swierenga, is that United States airlines will add 175 to 200 planes to their fleets this year, and more than 200 in both 1998 and 1999. If the economy slows, as he anticipates, capacity growth should outpace demand, which should mean lower load factors and more empty seats.
PKF Consulting, a San Francisco company specializing in the lodging industry, issued its 1998 forecast last week. It predicts the average room rate will climb 5.8 percent next year, compared with 7.2 percent in 1997, and that occupancies will vary significantly by city. The bad news for visitors to New York: PKF expects the average rate for a hotel room there to reach $200 by the end of 1998, making the city the first in the United States to achieve this dubious distinction.
 
Rewards for Short Trips
UAL's United Airlines has created a special offer for its frequent fliers to encourage them to use up miles on short weekend trips. Through March 31, 1998, travelers can obtain two tickets for a round-trip flight to a destination 750 miles or less away for 30,000 frequent flier miles, compared to the 50,000 miles such an award would normally require. Frequent travelers in New York, for example, can escape to Chicago; those in Denver, can fly off to gamble in Las Vegas, Nev. Requirements include an overnight Saturday stay, travel with an electronic ticket, and mileage redemption from one frequent flier account.
 
Facts From the Web
The Sabre Group, which runs the Travelocity web site (http:// www.travelocity.com), has teamed up with the guidebook publisher Lonely Planet to begin a new section on the site called "Your Planet." Set to start in November, the section will provide information on international destinations; maps and pictures from Lonely Planet books; tips on traveling off the beaten track; current visa, passport, travel and weather data for more than 220 countries, and a schedule of coming events and activities worldwide. The Columbus Group, a London travel information company, will also contribute to the new section.
 
Awards at Marriott
Beginning Oct. 15, Marriott International, will allow Hertz customers and passengers on United Airlines or British Airways to accrue points in the Marriott Rewards frequent guest program. Airline passengers will accrue between two and three points in the Marriott plan for each mile flown, depending on the type of ticket purchased. Hertz customers will be able to accrue up to 1,000 points for each rental. No hotel stay is required with any of these transactions. United and Hertz customers can ask to accrue points when they book or at the counter when they travel; British Airways passengers must make this request when they reserve flights.

HEADLINE: Japan Says Trade Surplus Is Up Sharply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The Japanese merchandise trade surplus rose more sharply than expected in August, the Finance Ministry announced today.
The surplus soared a seasonally adjusted 51.1 percent in August from July to 1.099 trillion yen ($9.12 billion), the Finance Ministry said. That was almost double the increase expected by economists. It was the third gain in more than five months. 
 From August 1996, the surplus grew 113.6 percent to 742.06 billion yen.
Exports rose 3.3 percent from the previous month. Imports declined 6.7 percent, another sign that an increase in the national sales tax since April 1 is discouraging consumer spending.
"With the effects of April's tax increase still here, there's no sign of a recovery in imports, and I can see exports rising through the year-end," Maki Miyazaki, an economist at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics Inc., said before the trade report.
The politically sensitive trade surplus with the United rose 59.8 percent to 350.60 billion yen in August from a year ago. About one-quarter of Japanese exports go to the United States.
United States officials have said that they would raise the issue of Japan's trade surplus at this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Hong Kong.
Japan's trade surplus with Asia expanded 27.2 percent, to 520 billion yen, in August from the corresponding month in 1996.
Overall imports totaled 3.238 trillion yen in August, the Government said. Imports were sluggish even as the dollar has lost about 5 percent of its value against the yen since May. That makes American goods cheaper.
Seasonally adjusted figures compare imports and exports from a month earlier, while ironing out differences in the number of working days and exceptions created by Japan's fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Clinton Faces Off With Congress on Trade

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton put his personal prestige on the line today, traveling to the Capitol to fight for new authority to negotiate trade deals in the face of muscular opposition from House leaders of his own party.
Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore appeared before a fractious caucus of House Democrats as senior Administration officials unveiled the trade legislation and then fanned out across the Capitol to sell the proposal at the heart of Mr. Clinton's second-term economic agenda. 
 The measure would grant Mr. Clinton what is often called "fast track" authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can approve or disapprove but not amend. Such authority has been held by every President since 1974. But it expired two years ago and Mr. Clinton chose not to push ahead with a vote that would have splintered the traditional Democratic coalition as he headed into a Presidential election year.
Today, however, Mr. Clinton joined the battle, arguing that expanded markets were crucial to continued prosperity. "Today 12 million American jobs are supported by exports," he said at the White House before his meeting with Democrats. "Today at the pinnacle of that strength, America must choose whether to advance or retreat. I believe the only way we can continue to grow and create good jobs in the future is to embrace global growth and expand American exports."
But the President did not mollify hard-core opponents in his party, who argue that American workers are hurt by competition with third world nations that have lower wages and lax environmental standards. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader and a likely primary opponent to Mr. Gore in the year 2000, nearly shouted his opposition after Mr. Clinton left.
Referring to a trip he made last week to the border with Mexico to survey living conditions, Mr. Gephardt said, "The people we met over the weekend are living in subhuman conditions. It is wrong."
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., meanwhile, announced that it had begun airing television and radio commercials against the measure at an initial cost of $1 million in the districts of 13 undecided lawmakers of both parties as well as radio ads throughout California.
While Mr. Clinton had planned to put forth the legislation last week, the White House delayed it as it sought ways to write a bill that could attract more Democratic support without losing Republican votes.
In the end, the bill contained some provisions designed to address objections from Democrats, organized labor and environmental groups. The legislation promised consultations with Congress and listed "workers rights and environmental protection" as negotiating objectives that the United States would pursue through the World Trade Organization.
Administration officials also pledged that the President would use his executive authority to negotiate separate side agreements on labor and the environment.
But the bill largely tracked language favored by Republicans and stopped well short of what many Democrats and labor unions wanted to see -- the placement of labor and environmental standards at the heart of any market opening accord, enforced by the threat of trade sanctions.
In a sign of just how delicate the balancing act is for votes in the Republican-controlled Congress, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he thought the bill "provides a reasonable base on which to start" but added that he had some reservations about the labor provisions that had been included in the legislation.
With the vote on the trade bill likely in October, a major question will be whether the Administration's pledges to heed labor and environmental concerns will be enough to sway undecided moderate Democrats. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said the steps the Administration had taken were "encouraging" but that he had not decided what to do. "Obviously, there is a good deal of difference of opinion," he said after Cabinet-level officials briefed Senate Democrats.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, predicted that it would be a "tough job" to pass the bill. "The President will have to participate in that very fully, as we will on our side of the aisle," he said.
Shadowing the trade debate are memories of a similar fight in 1993 over the North American Free Trade Agreement which involved trade with Mexico and Canada and which Mr. Clinton won with mostly Republican votes.
The Administration insisted at the time that it would be a boon to the economy. But an Administration assessment earlier this summer suggested that at most 90,000 to 160,000 American jobs rely on increased exports to Mexico as a result of that pact. In a booming economy that has created 13 million new jobs over the past four and a half years, that figure is hardly significant.
The critics of Nafta point to a United States trade surplus that has turned into a $16 billion trade deficit and say that American jobs are moving out. They also argue that the "side agreements" with Mexico on environmental and labor matters have not brought about reform and will not unless made a central part of trade agreements, with United States sanctions wielded as a threat.
Charlene Barshefsky, the President's chief negotiator, sought to rebut that viewpoint today by noting that the goal of trade agreements is to open rapidly growing markets to United States exports. "It is not realistic to suggest that countries will rewrite their domestic labor and environmental laws for the privilege of buying more of our goods," she told reporters as she made her way around the Capitol.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore met with House Democrats for more than an hour and tried to keep the mood civil despite the sharp differences. Democrats who participated in the closed-door session said more Democrats argued against the trade agreement than for it, and at times, participants said, the tone of the meeting turned testy.

HEADLINE: Senate Shelves Proposals to Restrict Indian Legal Protections

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The Senate backed away today from attempts to strip American Indian tribes of their legal immunity against lawsuits and to force tribes to report their income in order to receive Government benefits.
Under intense lobbying from Indian tribes and some of his fellow Republicans, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington agreed to drop his efforts. He had proposed both provisions as part of the spending bill for the Interior Department. 
 But in exchange, the Senate agreed to hold hearings on the immunity question and to bring it to a vote by next spring. It also authorized a Government study on whether future payments to Indians should be based on need instead of on the current formula based on population.
Across the Capitol, debate on yet another contentious issue in a spending bill put the House of Representatives on a collision course with the Senate and the White House. The House voted 295 to 125 tonight to block President Clinton's drive to establish voluntary national testing on mathematics for eighth-grade students and on reading for fourth graders by 1999.
The Senate voted 87 to 13 last week to rescue the plan.
But the probability of a political showdown with both the Senate and the President over the issue did not dissuade Representative Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania, from pushing to kill the testing plan on the House floor this evening.
Mr. Goodling's amendment was tacked onto the spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.
National testing for math and reading was in the 10-point plan for education that Mr. Clinton announced in his State of the Union Message in February. But the idea has drawn opposition from both sides of the political spectrum.
Many conservatives worry that national testing would be the first step toward a Federally imposed national curriculum that would weaken local control of education. Some liberals, including many of the black and Hispanic members in the House, fear that minority and other students in poor school districts will not perform well on national tests and that the test scores will be used against them.
The House was able to put off another bruising fight over spending when the chairman of the Transportation Committee, Representative Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, agreed to postpone further action on a three-year, $103 billion highway bill until next week.
The Transportation Committee was to vote on the bill on Wednesday. But Mr. Shuster, a Republican, said he postponed the vote after meeting this evening with Speaker Newt Gingrich to discuss the controversial measure.
Republican leaders had threatened to block Mr. Shuster from bringing his bill to the floor because they said it would have broken the balanced budget deal, outspending it by $30 billion over five years.
The debate in the Senate today ended with a victory for Indian tribes, but with a pledge that the fight would be rejoined.
"I have not gained the goal I set for myself," Mr. Gorton said. "But we are going to be able to debate these issues intelligently over the coming year in a way we haven't done in this Congress."
Critics of Mr. Gorton had said his proposals would have limited the sovereignty of American Indian tribes. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Republican and the only Indian in the Senate, complained that the proposals "constituted a dramatic departure from existing Federal Indian policy."
Last July, with little debate and no public hearings, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies included the two provisions in the 1998 spending bill for the Interior Department, which includes the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Mr. Gorton is chairman of the subcommittee.
One of Mr. Gorton's proposals would have forced the country's 554 Indian tribes to waive their sovereign immunity from civil lawsuits or lose up to $767 million in Federal money, nearly half the budget for daily operations on Indian land.
"It would have been grossly unfair to haul off and reinstate that Indian tribes can be sued by almost anyone for anything in almost any counts," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, who, with Mr. Campbell, led the fight against the provisions.
Indian leaders said that withoutthat legal protection, their tribes could face bankruptcy because of lawsuits and might be unable to operate as governments.
To entice Mr. Gorton to drop his provision on the immunity issue, the Senate's Indian Affairs Committee agreed to hold hearings and to schedule a vote by next May on a bill that would allow lawsuits against tribes.
Mr. Gorton's other proposal was just as vexing to Indian tribes. Through what is called means-testing, tribes would have been denied Federal money if their incomes were above a certain level.
Under current guidelines, Federal dollars to Indians are distributed through a formula based on the population and acreage of the various tribes. But citing the income that many tribes now get from gambling, Mr. Gorton and others have argued that Government aid to Indians should be based solely on need.
Opponents of Mr. Gorton's proposal argued that although there was a perception that Indians were getting wealthy from gambling, only a few tribes were making money.
A report last December by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said about a third of all American Indian tribes were involved in some sort of gaming. But the agency said that 10 tribes had taken in more than half of the $1.6 billion received by casinos on Indian reservations. The report also showed that unemployment on the reservations was more than three times the national average.

Appearing in Battery Park in lower Manhattan, she said she had to assume there would still be a runoff, and expressed hope that confusion with the vote count would not lessen voter interest in November. 

"They now have thousands of paper ballots that they need to review and count. And until they say otherwise, there will be a runoff next Tuesday. I am absolutely confident that as we move toward the general election, the vast majority of New Yorkers, who are ready for a change, will want a mayor who will set higher standards for students and teachers, will want a mayor who will grow the economy of this city, and who want a mayor who will pay attention to the quality of life in all neighborhoods will come out to vote."
 
THE REV. AL SHARPTON
 
At his campaign headquarters yesterday while taking a break from discussions with his lawyers over a possible challenge to the Board of Elections if it rules that there will be no runoff between him and Ruth W. Messinger:
 
"I think that while others major in speculation and confusion, we must keep our eyes on the prize. The prize is a new direction for the city and the defeat of Rudolph Giuliani. I will not be distracted with Board of Elections speculation or other speculation. I will continue to raise the issues of unemployment, bad schools, police brutality and will go forth in this runoff. If the Board of Election interferes with the runoff, we'll deal with it at that time. As of now, our agenda is full steam ahead."

HEADLINE: Poll Findings Hint at Trouble For Whitman Over Insurance

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

 BODY:
Most New Jersey voters say that neither they nor the state have benefited from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's income tax cuts, and now, seven weeks before Election Day, they give her low marks on the issue that they continue to cite as the state's biggest problem: the cost of auto insurance.
These results of a New York Times/CBS News poll underline the volatile nature of the New Jersey electorate, a group whose members overwhelmingly say they have no opinion of Mrs. Whitman's Democratic opponent for governor, State Senator James E. McGreevey, but who also tell poll takers that Mr. McGreevey is more likely than the Governor to bring down automobile insurance premiums. 
 Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed said they disapproved of the way that Governor Whitman has handled auto insurance rates, which are more expensive in New Jersey than in any other state. Asked which candidate is more likely to bring down those rates, 36 percent cited Mr. McGreevey while 25 percent chose Mrs. Whitman.
Mrs. Whitman's promise to cut income tax rates by 30 percent jump-started her 1993 campaign that ousted Gov. Jim Florio, and when she kept that promise a year ahead of time, she stood in the national spotlight. But as the fall campaign begins, almost half of New Jersey residents surveyed said they did not think the tax cut made much of a difference to the state. Asked what impact the income tax cut had on their own lives, two-thirds of those polled said that cut had not made much difference. Only 18 percent described the tax cut as good, nearly matched by the 13 percent who said it had been bad for them personally.
"What this poll says to me is that she has a real race on her hands," said Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia. "This is not the coronation that people expected a year ago."
Auto insurance has dominated the campaign debate all summer. Forty percent of the 901 New Jersey residents polled from last Thursday to Sunday cited auto insurance as the single most important issue that they wanted the next governor to address.
The next issues cited as problems were education (by 13 percent) and property taxes (by 11 percent). Democrats are working to persuade voters that local property taxes have increased as a result of the state income tax cut, and the poll shows their arguments may find fertile ground. Asked how Governor Whitman is handling property taxes, 53 percent said they disapproved while 24 percent approved of what she is doing. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
But the challenges for Mr. McGreevey are huge. Mr. McGreevey, a 40-year-old former assistant prosecutor who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge Township, N.J., remains relatively unknown to residents outside Middlesex County. Seventy-seven percent of registered voters surveyed said they did not know enough about Mr. McGreevey to offer an opinion of him.
Even so, when registered voters were asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today, Mrs. Whitman holds only a modest lead over Mr. McGreevey. Forty-four percent of registered voters chose Mrs. Whitman, and 35 percent preferred Mr. McGreevey. Fifteen percent were undecided. The remaining 5 percent said they would vote for neither candidate.
Despite reservations over the tax cuts and a preoccupation with auto insurance rates, 58 percent of those surveyed said that over all, they approve of the way Mrs. Whitman is handling her job as Governor.
Mrs. Whitman dismissed the poll's results about her modest lead over Mr. McGreevey. "I've never been a person who polled well," she said. "They've never been accurate in a race that I've been in. I focus on what I hear on the streets."
The poll results on her job performance put her comfortably ahead of where Mr. Florio was at this point in his campaign four years ago, a time when 47 percent of voters said they approved of his job as Governor. Mrs. Whitman defeated him that November by 25,000 votes.
The findings of the Times/CBS News poll are similar to those of other recent independent surveys. In a poll released yesterday by Quinnipiac College, New Jersey voters said they believed Mr. McGreevey would do a better job than Mrs. Whitman on the state's auto insurance problem. They also found that the Governor held a 49 to 37 percent overall lead in the gubernatorial contest.
Mrs. Whitman, who helped make auto insurance a campaign issue by vowing to reduce rates in her annual address to the State Legislature earlier this year, said she did not regret focusing public attention on the auto insurance problem. Although her own party in the Republican-controlled Legislature rejected her plan to reduce rates by giving consumers the option of reducing their coverage, Mrs. Whitman said she believed that "the legislators now understand how critical it is that they have got to address this issue."
Until last week, Governor Whitman has brought up auto insurance regularly on the campaign trail. But now her campaign aides say they are moving into the next phase of the campaign, extolling the Governor's record on other issues. In her first campaign television advertisement, which began broadcasting on New York and Philadelphia stations yesterday, the Governor does not mention auto insurance but hammers on the issues -- crime, jobs and welfare -- that tend to gain Mrs. Whitman her best ratings from voters.
In an interview yesterday, Mrs. Whitman vigorously defended her income tax cuts and expressed frustration about the poll's finding, showing that almost half of the state's residents do not believe that the tax cut has made a difference in the state. "The state has turned a corner, and we're back to where we should have been before," she said. "And that didn't just happen. It happened because of an aggressive program to cut taxes."
Richard McGrath, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, said he believed that the poll results showed the Governor's failings on the most important problems facing the state: auto insurance and property taxes. "The polls also reveal that the voters realize that Whitman shifted the tax burden onto the backs of homeowners and businesses," Mr. McGrath said. "She did the easy part of cutting taxes. But she opted to make up for the lost revenue with higher property taxes and budget gimmicks that will impose long-term debt on the taxpayers."
Mr. McGrath said that it was not surprising that Mr. McGreevey was not well known to voters outside Middlesex County at this stage of the campaign. Mr. McGreevey faces the challenge of most New Jersey candidates, making their first statewide election bid. Since New Jersey does not have its own major commercial television station, outside of Atlantic City, New Jersey voters get most of their information from New York and Philadelphia television stations that do not offer a steady diet of news about New Jersey or the race.
And the state program that publicly finances much of the race for governor limits campaign spending, prompting most statewide gubernatorial candidates to reserve most of their resources for their television advertising campaigns until the final weeks before Election Day.
Also, not many voters are now paying much attention to the race. The poll shows that only 12 percent of registered voters have said they have been able to "pay a lot of attention" to the gubernatorial campaign so far. Twenty percent more said that they will start paying more attention later this month, while an additional 42 percent said they will not start paying a lot of attention to the race until October.
Although Mrs. Whitman shows some vulnerability on the three most salient issues in the race -- auto insurance, property taxes and education -- the polls showed numerous strengths in other areas. She received high marks for her handling of crime, the state's economy, the environment and welfare.
But she is unlikely to earn many points at the polling booth for her tax cut. Only 16 percent of those polled said their state income taxes had gone down over the last four years, while 28 percent said they had gone up. The largest share, 43 percent, said their state income taxes remained the same.
At the same time, 59 percent said their property tax bills had gone up during the same period.
Professor Sabato attributed this to Mrs. Whitman for not getting more political mileage from her tax cut. He said the poll's finding, showing that voters give Mrs. Whitman little credit for her tax cut, says more about the Governor's failure to communicate effectively her administration's success than signaling a national trend that tax cuts are unimportant to voters, over all.
"It says that she has done an extraordinarily bad job of selling her major accomplishment," Mr. Sabato said. "Normally, a governor uses the tremendous resources at her disposal to communicate the fundamental accomplishments of the term. And she has not done that. And that is unusual. She seems to be good at public relations nationally. I suppose she would have been better off, staying home a good deal more."
But Mr. Sabato said voter concern over auto insurance also shows that voters are generally satisfied with the big issues, like the economy and jobs, and are focusing on minor irritants, like auto insurance. He noted that in Virginia, the only other state with a race for governor this year, a personal property tax on cars is dominating much of the campaign debate.
Mrs. Whitman said she hears the message loud and clear that voters are frustrated over auto insurance and property taxes. "I don't know if that means at the end of the day, they will vote against me," she said. "They just want to make sure that I don't take anything for granted and that I don't think I've solved every problem in the State of New Jersey. I understand that and I hear them, and auto insurance will be the No. 1 focus when this election is over."
 
How the Poll of New Jersey Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from last Thursday through Sunday with 901 adult residents of New Jersey. Of these, 744 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of New Jersey exchanges. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each area of the state was represented in proportion to its population.
For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex and age.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New Jersey.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 4 percentage points for registered voters.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Clinton Will Seek Tougher Proposals To Rein In Smoking

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton will decisively reject a proposed tobacco deal negotiated by state officials and cigarette company lawyers and will outline his own tobacco policy in an Oval Office speech on Wednesday, White House officials said today.
Mr. Clinton will insist that his chief goal -- reducing the number of teen-agers who smoke -- can be accomplished only by a sharp increase in the price of cigarettes, by as much as $1.50 a pack over 10 years, the officials said. 
 In his first extended public comments on the sweeping nationwide tobacco proposal announced on June 20, Mr. Clinton will praise the efforts of state attorneys general, plaintiffs' lawyers, health advocates and tobacco company executives in devising a plan to advance important public health goals while settling dozens of tobacco-related lawsuits.
But the President will insist that the $368.5 billion settlement plan does not go far enough to discourage smoking by minors or to help the nation's 45 million smokers end their nicotine addiction, aides said.
While not spelling out a detailed legislative proposal, the President will describe the overriding principles that he believes must guide the nation's approach to tobacco use, aides said. Among the tenets of the President's plan are unfettered authority for the F.D.A. to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug, fundamental changes in the way cigarettes are made and sold in this country and the rapid disclosure of documents that chronicle the legal, scientific and public relations conduct of the nation's tobacco companies in the past 40 years. Mr. Clinton will also call for some form of compensation to be paid to tobacco growers, whose income will decline as the nation's tobacco consumption falls.
According to calculations by economists at the Health and Human Services and Treasury Departments, the number of teen-agers who start smoking drops by 7 percent for every 10 percent increase in price. On that basis, Administration officials calculated that if prices rose by $1.50 over the current average of $2 a pack, the President's goal would be achieved: Reducing the number of teen-age smokers by two-thirds over 10 years.
The price would be expected to rise because tobacco companies would be fined if smoking levels did not decline rapidly enough.
The White House has yet to begin drafting legislation to embody the President's principles, but Mr. Clinton called on Congress today to address the issue soon. He could present his own bill or work with Congress on one.
"We ought to get this legislation through Congress as quickly as we can," the President said at an appearance in which he discussed trade policy. "I would hope that we can get all the parties to the lawsuits involved to agree to it, but we have to do it right."
Congressional leaders have said that action on what is certain to be a complex and contentious legislative package is not likely this year. And the White House does not appear to be in a hurry, calculating that the industry's position is weakening and that tobacco control will be an effective election-year issue in 1998 for the Democrats.
Enthusiasm has waned for the agreement reached in June. That deal would have required five major tobacco companies to pay $368.5 billion, mainly to settle lawsuits filed by smokers and by states seeking to recoup Medicaid payments for smoking-related illnesses. The companies also agreed to restrict marketing, to finance anti-smoking campaigns and to pay fines if smoking among youths did not fall below certain levels. The plan called for price increases of roughly 65 cents a pack over 25 years. But it would have limited the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.
The two officials who coordinated the Administration's three-month review of the original tobacco settlement proposal -- Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Bruce Reed, the President's chief domestic policy adviser -- are expected to be at the Oval Office event on Wednesday.
Also expected are others supporting Mr. Clinton on this issue, including Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman; the Mississippi Attorney General, Michael A. Moore, one of the central negotiators of the June tobacco accord; Matthew L. Myers, a lawyer for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and another architect of the June deal, and Dr. David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs and a longtime anti-tobacco crusader. Dr. Kessler's criticism of the original plan helped persuade Mr. Clinton to scrap the deal in favor of a tougher approach.
"What the President has cared about from the beginning is reducing the number of kids who smoke, and this will work," Dr. Kessler said in an interview today. "This is no longer about whether the deal is worth $360 billion or $500 billion or $700 billion. It's about what works, and I think this does."
Tobacco industry officials will not be represented at the White House announcement, said J. Phil Carlton, a North Carolina lawyer who represented the major cigarette makers in the negotiations.
Mr. Carlton said the industry had not decided how it would respond to the President's announcement. But he said he hoped that Mr. Clinton would endorse legislation to conclude the dozens of lawsuits, filed by individual smokers and by 40 states, that threaten the industry.
"If he'll come on out, as I understand he will, and call for Congressional action on national legislation, that would be good," Mr. Carlton said in an interview. "That doesn't mean we can agree to some of the things he may try to add to the June 20 agreement."
The industry's interest in reaching a settlement with the attorneys general has always been to find a single-stroke solution to the potentially ruinous litigation it faces from coast to coast. The June accord would settle most of those suits.
But Mr. Clinton's principles go far beyond the settlement proposal, particularly on the cost to industry of failing to meet specified targets on smoking by teen-agers.

HEADLINE: Fighting Religious Persecution

 BODY:
Conservatives in America have long been part of the human rights movement, but in the past they have largely focused on abuses committed by Communist governments. Today they are broadening their concerns. A small group of activists has succeeded in putting repression of Christians in other countries on the national agenda. This has brought attention to an important, neglected problem, and increased consideration of human rights in American foreign policy. But it has also produced demagoguery among politicians eager to gain points with the Christian right.
One example is a bill that purports to fight religious persecution, but is so poorly designed it would do little to help religious freedom abroad. The legislation, sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter and Representative Frank Wolf, has the support of the Republican leadership and appears to have a good chance of passing in some form. It would set up a new White House office to monitor and classify religious persecution. A finding of certain types of persecution would automatically trigger a variety of economic sanctions, starting with a ban on American exports to abusive government agencies and possibly including a cutoff of all non-humanitarian aid and American votes against international bank loans. The President could waive the sanctions on national security grounds. 
 The office would be required to investigate persecution of Christians and a few other minorities in Communist and many Islamic countries. All other religious persecution would be addressed at the director's discretion. While the bill's authors say it is not their intention, such an unbalanced mandate is offensive to Muslims, Jews and other religious groups that are also subject to abuse. The most common type of religious persecution -- limits on religious assembly -- is not covered at all in the bill. Immediate export sanctions would apply only to the entity directly carrying out persecution. No money, for instance, could go to a specific military barracks that tortured Christians, but it could go to the army or defense ministry responsible, making the sanctions meaningless.
One curious provision would change the rules of asylum and refugee applications in America to insure that people who say they are fleeing religious persecution would get a hearing. This is a welcome acknowledgment that the new rules that became effective in April do not protect refugees and asylum seekers. But the bill might end up filling the refugee quota with those fleeing religious persecution, thus shutting out other applicants. Its changes should apply to those fleeing all kinds of oppression.
This provision reflects the bill's relegation of all other persecution to second-class status. The torture of Christians is heinous, but so is the torture of ethnic Tutsi or union organizers. In most countries where religion is attacked, such attacks are part of a wide spectrum of human rights abuses.
Groups with a special concern for religious persecution are right to demand more attention to the issue. Instead of trying to create a new office in the White House separate from the policy-making process, however, they should work to strengthen the State Department's human rights bureau. If there is a political stampede to approve this bill, Congress must rewrite and broaden it to cover all manner of persecution and all religious groups equally.

A Player of Few Words Is Ready for No. 1 Speaking Role

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y., Sept. 16

 BODY:
When he began sounding off about things like unfair labor agreements and bad economics two summers ago, everyone associated with Patrick Ewing wondered what had happened to the often reserved and quiet man they thought they knew.
Ewing and the Bulls' Michael Jordan had led a faction of players that failed in its bid to decertify the players union, but the Knicks center had said his piece and made his point clear: beyond his playing exploits, he wanted to make a difference in the league's future. 
 After winning a majority of the vote to become the players association's president over the weekend, he will get his chance. Succeeding his teammate Buck Williams, Ewing will serve a four-year term that runs parallel with his new Knicks pact.
"Buck did the best job that he felt he could," Ewing said as he left the Knicks' practice facility at SUNY-Purchase today. "No disrespect to him, but I'm going to try to be the best leader I can possibly be also."
Ewing's election comes at a very pivotal time for the players association. With the growing possibility that the league will reopen the collective bargaining agreement next year, he could be at the forefront of securing a new deal and coping with a potential lockout. He will have to be outspoken and take charge.
This is the same guy who has spent the last 13 years quietly going about his business in the media capital of the world. He will have to dispel the notion that he has never been a vocal leader in the locker room.
"It doesn't mean anything, what other people think about you," said Herb Williams, Ewing's teammate and a players association vice president. "It's just their opinion. If he was really vocal, then guys would say: 'Well, he's too vocal. He needs to shut up some time.' You never hear that about Mike. I don't see him shouting and screaming at people. I never hear anybody say he's not vocal enough."
Billy Hunter, the players association executive director, said: "Still waters run deep. I don't see it as a problem at all. Patrick doesn't waste words. He's not always running off at the mouth with a lot of rhetoric. He's a very emotional person and I think that also validates his position."
Among the 18 player representatives who voted, Hunter said Ewing won by an overwhelming margin. He beat out Charles Smith, Mitch Richmond, Tyrone Corbin and Chris Dudley. The fact that Ewing was the most high-profile player among the candidates probably did not hurt.
"We had decent leadership with Buck, but I think it's good for a player of his caliber to step in and accept the responsibility," Herb Williams said. "You look at baseball, you look at their top players: Greg Maddux, Cecil Fielder, Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds. All their top players are the guys in the union sitting at the table. When you look at us, we have guys like myself and other guys that are not that well known.
"Buck probably could have run again if he wanted to, but I'm not sure he wanted to. He's like me; his career is winding down. When you had an Oscar Robertson and a Tommy Heinsohn, well, we need guys like that to step up to the plate and take responsibility."
There are other dynamics involved. Ewing will have to deal extensively with Commissioner David Stern, whom he penned a letter of discontent to in June after the league suspended Ewing and four other Knicks for leaving the bench against Miami in the second round of the playoffs. Ewing felt the league effectively cost New York the series.
Also, as one of the leaders of the decertification movement -- an effort to avoid what he felt was an inadequate collective bargaining agreement -- Ewing was accused of essentially being a tool of what many perceived to be an agent-led movement. Ewing, feeling his intelligence was being questioned, was furious regarding the perception that his agent, David Falk, was somehow steering his intentions.
Finally, Ewing and others feel that many of their predictions regarding the league turning into a caste system under the current agreement have come true.
"We're concerned about it, but we have to play under this agreement," Ewing said. "Unless the league blows the agreement up, we can't do anything about it. They're going to do whatever they feel is right. We, as players, have to stick together and fight on for what happened two years ago."

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
A Kicker Sues, Saying She Was Treated Unfairly

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

 BODY:
In 1993, Heather Sue Mercer left Yorktown Heights, N.Y., believing that her place-kicking skills, which had helped the high school win a state football championship, were good enough to secure a spot on the Duke University football team.
Four frustrating years later, after being told that she was on the team, and then not being given a uniform or being allowed to practice with the team or stand on the sideline during games, Mercer says that there was never a place for her on the Duke team. 
 Mercer, now a senior at Duke, filed a lawsuit in Federal court in Durham, N.C., yesterday against Duke and its football coach, Fred Goldsmith, claiming that the coach did not give her a fair opportunity to become the only female place-kicker on a Division I team. Mercer is alleging that Duke violated Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, which prohibit sex discrimination in college athletic programs that receive federal funds. She is also suing under North Carolina law for constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract.
Mike Cragg, the Duke University sports information director, said Goldsmith had not seen the lawsuit and neither the coach nor the university would comment on it.
"I think that people should be aware of what happened to me, and I hope it never happens to anyone else," Mercer said yesterday. "The idea of anyone else going through what I went through for four years is nauseating to me."
Mercer's lawsuit asks for compensatory and punitive damages for emotional distress and for the loss of opportunity to play football at another college or to participate in future amateur or professional athletics. She said any money she might receive from the lawsuit would be used to set up a college scholarship fund for promising female kickers.
Mercer, an economics major who will graduate next May, does not have any more college athletic eligibility. She was on the Duke fencing team while pursuing a place-kicking slot.
In a telephone call from North Carolina yesterday afternoon, Mercer sounded frustrated, angry and hurt when talking about her four years of trying to make the Duke football team.
"I just kept believing that they would see me as a kicker and not someone who often wore a skirt to the office," Mercer said. "Most athletes take it for granted that they have someone around them that supports them. It's tough when you don't have that. But it's worst to be made to feel that you don't even belong. It hurts."
Mercer, 21, was a walk-on player at Duke as a freshman in the fall of 1994 and was given what she describes as a "private tryout" by Goldsmith and members of his coaching staff. Mercer was allowed to practice only with the other walk-on kickers even though, she said, other walk-on kickers were allowed to practice with the team, were issued uniforms and were even allowed to dress for games -- things, she said, that she was denied during her quest to make the team. At one point, Mercer said, Goldsmith told her she could sit in the stands with her boyfriend during home games.
In April 1995, Mercer was selected to the Blue team for the annual Blue-White intrasquad game. She kicked a game-winning 28-yard field goal in the Blue team's 24-22 victory. Mercer said Fred Chatham, Duke's kicking coach at the time, told her she had made the team. But she had not. In the fall, she said, the same pattern emerged.
Mercer said that Goldsmith told her that she would be a distraction to the team if she were allowed to be in uniform and stand on the sideline, even though he wanted her to conduct news media interviews about being the only female kicker on a Division I team.
During the summer of 1995, Mercer said, she wrote a letter to Goldsmith asking him why he was not going to allow her to attend practice that summer. She said he telephoned her at home and asked her why she was interested in football and why she did not want to be in beauty pageants instead.
Finally, this past spring, Mercer said Goldsmith told her that she had no place on the team.
Mercer said that during the summers she attended kicking camps to help sharpen her skills and that no one at any of those camps told her that she did not have the ability to compete at the Division I level.
Mercer attended camps run by Bill Renner, Paul Woodside and Mark Moseley, the former kicker for the Washington Redskins. "She kicks the ball well enough to be competitive with other college kickers," Renner said by telephone last night. Renner, who runs the Fourth Down Sports Kicking Camp, said he thought enough of Mercer's skills to include her on his camp's staff last summer. Telephone messages to the offices of Woodside and Moseley were not returned yesterday.
Mercer said she never considered transferring to another college to pursue her place-kicking.
"It was suggested to me by those close to me, because they knew kicking was a big part of me, and they saw the frustration and hurt that I was going through," Mercer said. "I was never willing to give up. I felt like transferring would be giving up. I was happy academically. If I made it at another school, I would have felt like I had settled for second best, because I didn't make it at Duke."
Asked what she hoped to accomplish with the lawsuit, Mercer said: "At the very least people will know what happened down here. Everybody always thinks that everybody gets a fair shot at making the team. Maybe they will understand better what happens to somebody who is a little different when they try to accomplish something. I hope it changes some minds.
"Place-kicking is not about the size of your leg or whether you're male or female or you weigh 200 pounds. It's whether you can get the ball through the uprights with accuracy and consistency. Girls can do that."

Thailand Ponders Reform In Midst of Economic Crisis
A draft constitution stressing government accountability and civil liberties has become a flash point in Thailand, fueled by the nation's economic discontent. This frustration with the Government reflects an emerging social conflict in a nation where the political structure has not modernized along with the country's rapid growth. A6 

Space Junk Just Misses Mir
The Russian space station Mir narrowly avoided disaster when it almost collided with a United States military satellite, which had been taken out of service in 1994. The three crew members aboard Mir had sealed themselves into the Soyuz re-entry capsule to make a fast getaway in case of a collision. NASA officials estimate that about 10,000 pieces of junk are in orbit; the satellite had been used for a few months and then discarded. A14
 
Cold War Converts to Drug War
A screening system, partly based on a technology developed to detect Soviet warheads during the cold war, will soon be deployed to detect narcotics being smuggled across the border from Mexico, the Clinton Administration's drug policy chief, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, announced. "There is no question that this will work," he told reporters. A5
 
U.S. Seeks Mine Compromise
The Clinton Administration scrambled to reach a compromise on a treaty to ban land mines, hoping to avoid international censure. Details of the new American position were not yet public, but other countries seemed opposed to amendments other than possibly agreeing to a delayed timetable. A6
 
A Bomb Explodes Near Belfast
A bomb exploded in a town west of Belfast, disrupting the Northern Ireland peace talks in which Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, is taking part. Protestant political leaders blamed the I.R.A. for the blast, which damaged a police station, and demanded that Sinn Fein be expelled from the talks. The I.R.A. denied responsibility. A14
 
Protest Over Bosnia Elections
Several senior officials working for the organization that administered the elections this weekend in Bosnia have threatened to resign because of the body's failure to annul votes cast for the ruling Serb Democratic Party in Pale. They say the party should not have been allowed to field candidates in the local elections because it is run by Radovan Karadzic, who is charged with war crimes. A14
 
Bodyguard in Crash Is Alert
Trevor Rees-Jones, sole survivor of the high-speed crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, has recovered from serious injuries and was described by a doctor as "perfectly conscious." French prosecutors hope he will be able to recall the crash and shed light on the role, if any, played by photographers pursuing the Princess and her companion, Emad Mohamed Al-Fayed. A12

Reno to Replace Leaders Of Election Finance Inquiry
Attorney General Janet Reno, embarrassed by missteps and discord in the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation, will replace the top Federal prosecutor and F.B.I. agent in charge of the inquiry with more experienced personnel. The reshuffling is an attempt to get control of the agency's most important investigation, one that has created serious internal tensions, demands for the appointment of an independent prosecutor and accusations that she has refused to seek such a counsel to protect the White House.

Testimony Conflicts at Hearing
A college professor who was Vice President Dan Quayle's national security adviser testified at the campaign finance hearings that he attended a coffee with President Clinton at the White House last year where a Democratic Party official explicitly solicited campaign contributions. But another witnesses, a friend and golfing partner of the President who attended the same coffee, insisted that no one at the event asked for money. A26
 
Report Clears Breast Implants
Silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancer and there is only "borderline" evidence linking the devices to any other disease, according to a Federal review of scores of medical studies. The review pointed to the possibility that implants could help protect against breast cancer, but researchers said more studies were needed to draw that conclusion. A19

Antibiotics Are Overprescribed
Doctors wrote 12 million antibiotic prescriptions in a single year for colds, bronchitis and other respiratory infections against which the drugs are almost always useless, a study has found. Such indiscriminate use of antibiotics has contributed to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, a growing problem in the United States, the researchers said. A22

ROTH, ARTHUR THOMAS

 BODY:
ROTH-Arthur Thomas, ninetyone, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, September 17, at his home of sixty years in Rockville Centre, New York. He will long be remembered in American banking circles for the extraordinary innovations he successfully brought to commercial banking as CEO of the Franklin National Bank before retiring in 1968, and more locally for his dynamic role in spearheading the phenomenal economic growth of Long Island following W.W. II for which the press dubbed him "Mr. Long Island". His family however will remember him as a loving husband, father and grandfather whose generosity, warmth, strength, and will to do the right thing is deeply impressed on them all. His many acts of community and church leadership and his widespread philanthropy speak for themselves. He leaves his wife of 67 years, Genevieve, and his daughter Mrs. Carol Madigan of Oldwick, New Jersey, and son, Donald Arthur Roth of E. Setauket, N.Y., their spouses John P. Madigan, Jr. and Mrs. Patricia Roth, five grandchildren and three great grandchildren. He will be interred at the Holy Rood Cemetery, Westbury, New York, on Saturday, September 20, following a 9 AM Mass of the Resurrection at St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Centre. Visitation will be at Macken Mortuary, 52 Clinton Ave., Rockville Centre, on Thursday and Friday between 2 and 4 PM and 7 and 9 PM.

HEADLINE: With a Nod and a Wink

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
WHEN Marcel Duchamp put a bicycle seat on the wall and called it art, the world of decorating changed forever.
It is reassuring to remember this every so often, amid the angst over what fabric will spiff up that impossible 10-year-old sofa and the nagging suspicion that fine furniture is only for connoisseurs. Decorating was once a tortuous match game. Now, it is just as tedious to hunt and gather the right pieces to achieve the ever-elusive personal style. 
 Minimalism may be nobody's idea of fun, but it sure made the job easier.
It's time to spread a wider net. Two Manhattan designers who have done so are Kevin Roberts and Timothy Haynes. They hold that a Louis XVI settee and a skateboarding teen-ager can coexist in the same living room, that one can demand ease even while yearning for elegance. Welcome to a style of decorating that one can live with and even love.
The rules of decorating have never been more relaxed, but that, too, can be a challenge: if anything goes, where to begin?
Mr. Roberts and Mr. Haynes don't get their rules from a pattern book. They learn from the scale, proportions and lines of painting and sculpture, from the character of architecture and the wisdom of other cultures (Mr. Roberts started as an anthropologist).
O.K., so they're professionals. It's their job to stockpile experience and have clever ideas. But what makes them stand out as leaders of a new interior design direction is the way they honor both the esthetic high ground and the reality of daily use. "I had very stiff grandparents who liked formal rooms that we were never allowed to enter," Mr. Roberts recalled. "I learned early that the only houses that make sense are houses that get used."
So the first thing he asks a client is, "Where are you going to flop?"
In three projects, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Haynes faced typical hurdles: giving a rented loft in Manhattan personality; making a hallway kitchen less of a drawback in a tiny Upper East Side town-house apartment, and lending spaciousness to a period house in Cambridge, Mass., with small rooms and low ceilings. The standout interiors they put together share one thing: an easy elegance.
So where does Marcel Duchamp come in? "The freedom to take furniture out of context and let it stand like sculpture came straight from the Dada movement," said Mr. Roberts, whose second rule of thumb is, wherever possible, to allow each piece breathing space. He prefers classics, whether pedigree or plain beat up, so treating an armchair like a piece of sculpture is not as precious as it sounds. Breaking the lock step of sofa, chair and coffee table can also be practical, he insists. He lets the dynamics of life decide where the furniture goes.
Mr. Roberts, the decorator of the team, uses an old French upholsterer's trick to give a fine chair multiple lives: he'll take a Jacobean armchair, for instance, and put green velvet on the front and a green and white check on the back, making it interesting from any angle, whether at a dining table or a computer terminal.
"There's no wrong spot," he says.
In the Cambridge house one day, Mr. Roberts stepped into the breach as a dry cleaner's van sat idling outside. He ran around searching out the dirty laundry. He and Mr. Haynes, the architect, treat their clients with the old-fashioned courtliness of a young Ogden Codman humoring his client Edith Wharton.
"I find it helps keep things in perspective," Mr. Roberts said. "When clients get hysterical about a delayed schedule, I'm the one reminding them that none of this is about life and death, but about making living pleasant." And good humor can be as easy as placing a classical bust in the kitchen for a hatrack.
Mr. Roberts fondly remembers when the house of Joan and Elon Kohlberg in Cambridge was "a dark, dinky little dollhouse." The front rooms are so small that 12 paces mark off the living room. So the designers did something radical without tearing out a single wall. They treated the front half of the house -- living room, dining room and entrance -- as a continuous space by using the same wallpaper and placing light-color furniture throughout.
"You can trick yourself into seeing the rooms look bigger," Mr. Roberts said. He pointed to another artful device for fooling the eye: eliminating rugs and using only furniture with legs (wrought-iron garden tables can look especially lyrical) makes the space flow. To soften the bare floors of the living room, he covered a huge ottoman in an Oriental-rug pattern that cleverly alludes to the real thing. "Whenever I come over, that's where the kids are," he said, referring to the two Kohlberg sons.
Mr. Roberts and Mr. Haynes agree that no matter how modest the home, creating a sense of architecture is worth the effort. They take their cue in this from Edith Wharton, whose 1898 manifesto, "The Decoration of Houses," is often credited with upgrading interior design from upholstery to an art and avocation.
Bland architecture may be the curse of post-World War II dwellings. Still, there's hope. "Without good bones, you are lost and there's no Band-Aid," Mr. Roberts said, "but good bones are easily gotten. All you need is one good wall."
At the Kohlberg house, five-foot-high wainscoting in the kitchen and white-painted wood paneling in the dining room were low-key, hard-working additions. They add architectural interest and create informal backdrops to sophisticated pairings of the incongruous: a Roman bust on a Deco console; a Chinese chair alongside a painted Swedish chest.
And in the 3,500-square-foot Manhattan loft, the designers created an illusion of columns by hanging 10-foot-tall curtains of green Thai silk.
 ONCE you've seen how other people live, it opens you up to considering ways of doing things that might never have occurred to you," Mr. Roberts said. He described a mountaintop plantation house without walls he once visited in Jamaica where the clouds passed through the living room, and a cozy haven of a bedroom tucked under the gables of a Swiss house overlooking Lake Geneva. He carries his wide vocabulary of images to the most pedestrian job sites.
The idea of hiding a banal kitchen in the loft behind a beautiful screen came from grand 19th-century apartments in Paris. "When plumbing was added to these perfect rooms," Mr. Haynes said, "they dealt with it very casually."
And sometimes, "the solution to a problem is exactly what makes a place special," he added.
The tiny town-house apartment of Elizabeth Tops and Arnie Lizan on the Upper East Side seemed to have an insoluble defect: the only way to get to the living room was through a kitchen.
So the design team made the most of the awful truth and turned the kitchen into an illuminated manuscript by covering the walls with exotic wallpaper -- saffron yellow with a Gothic-style fretwork pattern. The result is so bright and unexpected that visitors pass through dazzled, without noticing the dishes in the sink.
Wallpaper has many uses. The designers employed it to great advantage in the loft, where they fabricated the kitchen screen in a jiffy by stapling a foliage print from Zuber to a makeshift wooden frame. "It made the whole place feel like the trees outdoors had been drawn in," Mr. Haynes said.
And the designers use panoramic wallpapers to make tiny spaces, especially foyers and dens, look bigger.
"They give a tremendous sense of quality," Mr. Haynes said. "We use them a lot in new construction. It's a great way to get beyond wallboard."
The designers have heard the talk about a return to luxury, but they aren't buying it. "The 80's are over for good," Mr. Haynes said. "People don't want to recreate the luxuries of the past, but they do want some glamorous things." It's what sets grown-up homes apart from dorm rooms.
Consider the antique sconce. For the loft, Mr. Roberts bought two over-the-top, four-foot-tall sconces that epitomized his idea of luxury -- something that is part gorgeous, part useless. Mirrors, when they have lost their silver, can still convey faded glamour.
Paint is the most economical luxury of all. Walls of Granny Smith apple green make a fashion splash in the loft and make its white 1960's armchairs pop.
There are stunning pieces in the tiny town-house apartment -- a reproduction 17th-century English sofa and Marie Antoinette armchairs with tapestry seats. But in Mr. Haynes's view, the layering of saturated color is what invests the room with theatrical richness. He points to the contrast of Cognac velvet against a pale, chalky green wall and an Esteban Vicente painting splashed with reds and golds.
"It's not about the antiques that happen to be there," Mr. Roberts said of this apartment and also of the team's design approach. "But in the end, it's the composition that makes all the impact."

HEADLINE: New York Arts Council Wins 15 Percent Increase

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
While the National Endowment for the Arts is struggling to survive, its state counterpart, the New York State Council on the Arts, has quietly won an increase of nearly 15 percent in its budget from Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature.
The 37-year-old state arts council emerged from the raucous budget fray in Albany a few weeks ago with a budget of $40.8 million for this fiscal year, up from $35.7 million last year. While other states' arts agencies received increases this year, New York, which has the largest budget of any state, increased its arts budget by a greater percentage than many other states. 
 Though the most ardent arts champions say the increase is still insufficient, veterans of previous budget battles said they were satisfied. Coming on the heels of a $3 million increase last year, they said, the current rise means that the arts council's budget has grown by almost a third in two years. It also shows that the council itself is finally rebounding, they said, from the budget reductions and downsizing of the New York City and State fiscal crises of the mid-70's, and the recession that hit the state during the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. During the recession of the late 80's and early 90's, the council's budget was cut almost in half, as was its staff.
"We're clearly on our way back at last," said Reba White Williams, an art historian and a member of the council's 10-person, unpaid board.
The increase is due partly to the strong economy and budget surplus in Albany but also to months of low-key, persistent lobbying by arts groups.
"It's not just enough to have a budget surplus," said Jonathan Katz, who heads the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies in Washington.
In New York, arts supporters credited the increase to advocacy in the State Senate by Roy Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, who is chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs; in the Assembly by Paul A. Tokasz, Democrat of Buffalo, the new chairman of the Assembly's Tourism, Arts and Sports Development Committee; and in the Pataki administration by Earle Mack, the New Jersey real estate developer, who was appointed by the Governor to head the council 16 months ago. Mr. Mack, a major supporter of the ballet, succeeded Kitty Carlisle Hart, the beloved performer now in her 80's, who stepped down after serving through five administrations.
Because Mrs. Hart was greatly admired, the nomination of Mr. Mack, who was a financial supporter of Mr. Pataki's campaign, was greeted suspiciously by many artists and arts organizations. But he has since earned significant respect.
"Getting the budget increases was nothing short of miraculous," Mrs. Hart said of her successor.
The New York council has distributed more than $900 million in grants ranging from hundreds to many thousands of dollars since it was established by the Legislature in 1960 at the behest of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Rockefeller made public support for the arts one of his priorities.
Last year, panels of artists in 15 disciplines sifted through more than 4,000 requests for grants, awarding 2,869 grants to more than 1,300 museums, cultural heritage groups and performing arts companies throughout the state.
New York arts groups receive more money from the National Endowment for the Arts than groups in any other state, but the state council gives more money to the groups than the endowment does. Last year, the endowment awarded about $17 million to New York-based groups, less than half of that awarded by the state council.
"We wouldn't have today's rich network of Off and Off Off Broadway theaters were it not for N.Y.S.C.A.," said Robert Marx, the director of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, who was the director of the council's theater program between 1976 and 1982.
Mr. Marx noted that the national endowment was patterned on New York's arts council and drew some of its early staff from it.
But the state council, he added, has rarely been subjected to the political pressures that have battered the national endowment, insulation that Mr. Marx attributes mainly to New York's more liberal political climate and to Mrs. Hart's stewardship.
Mrs. Hart said it was easier to rally support for the arts in New York than in Congress because of the arts' obvious importance to the economy. "You'd have to be living in a tree not to understand what the arts mean to New York," she said.
Unfortunately, Mrs. Hart and Mr. Marx agreed, Governor Cuomo did not share his Republican predecessor's commitment to the council. When fiscal retrenchment was necessary, many areas of public spending were cut, but the retrenchment for the council was particularly severe. "If we at N.Y.S.C.A. made a mistake," Mr. Marx said, "it was in failing to prepare for the day when money would be tight and Rockefeller would no longer be governor."
Suddenly the arts had to compete in Albany for a share of a shrinking budget. While the Republican-dominated Senate traditionally protected arts money, the Assembly, long a Democratic preserve, favored giving the limited state money to social welfare projects.
Norma P. Munn, who heads the New York City Arts Coalition, which represents small as well as larger institutions, credited Mr. Tokasz and Mr. Mack with having helped persuade the Assembly to become a real partner in obtaining money for the arts. "They were both enormously helpful," she said.
Mr. Mack said that a key to his strategy was underscoring the arts' importance to the state's fiscal health. During his first week on the job, Mr. Mack dined with Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, to discuss how to emphasize the arts' economic impact. A result was a joint study by McKinsey & Company that concluded that Government arts support is a low-risk, high-yield investment that recovers several times its cost in taxes and generates billions of dollars in economic benefits.
Also, when Mr. Mack calls, Albany tends to listen. A major campaign contributor to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Mack also gave $25,000 to Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign and helped organize a major fund-raiser. Though somewhat shy and deliberately low key, he manages to find common ground with upstate and city legislators.
The major budget battle behind him, Mr. Mack is now raising private support to supplement the $350,000 Albany has given the council for an arts technology conference next March and rebuilding the council's staff. He also got a small increase in the honorarium for the dozens of New Yorkers who serve on the council's grant-making panels. "Now they'll get $100 a day instead of $75," he said.

HEADLINE: Brother (or Sister), Can You Spare a Dime for a Boom-Era Economist?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The better the economy, the worse things seem to get for economists.
Fifteen years of expansion interrupted by just one brief downturn in the early 1990's have helped to erode the market for the people in American corporations who study the economy for a living. "If your job is forecasting recessions, you've got a pretty sleepy job," said Paul Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. 
 That was just one reason that the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, which concluded here today in this city known for celebrating good times, was such a sedate affair.
Sustained prosperity, corporate downsizing that has made research expendable and a backlash against the economic fraternity's inflated forecasting claims have all combined to make the life of a business economist tougher than ever. Indeed, for a lot of economists these days, job insecurity is not an abstract principle but a day-to-day reality.
Much of the program at the meeting was given over to self-improvement panels on topics like "successful job switching," "hot career opportunities" and "how economists can play a role in their firm's decision making," and corridor talk often began with old friends telling of new jobs or the search for them.
Among the missing was Alison Lynn Reaser. A former economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, she lost that job in the takeover by Wells Fargo & Company. She landed at Barnett Banks in Florida but is now uncertain of what will happen after its acquisition by Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C. Ms. Reaser had signed up to attend the meeting here but could not make it because of a freeze on travel by Barnett, a friend said.
"Hundreds of economists are in the same boat," said Ken Ackbarali, a Los Angeles consultant who lost his job in the Wells Fargo takeover of First Interstate.
John H. Ortego was left behind in Albany when his one-time employer, the Key Corporation, moved to Cleveland. "I have joined the army of the self-employed," said Mr. Ortego, who just resigned his latest post as an economist in Buffalo with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
While banks and industrial companies have been trimming economics departments for years, the employment distress in this field has never been so acute. And the contrast with the 1980's -- which started with a deep recession and saw record Federal budget deficits amid a booming stock market and the end of high inflation -- could not be starker.
"We were in nirvana as economists in the early 80's," said Bernard M. Markstein, who set up a consulting business in Phoenixville, Pa., after losing a job at Meridian Bank just before it was taken over by Corestates Bank.
Now, cost-conscious senior management finds little use for predictions from in-house experts when a wide array of forecasts, none of them particularly more trustworthy than another, are readily available.
"Forecasting," Mr. Markstein acknowledged, "is not what we do best."
Not that they don't keep trying. The National Association for Business Economics consensus predicts that the economy will grow 2.3 percent next year. And slightly more than half of the respondents are forecasting a recession in 1999. But even the experts do not put much stock in those predictions. "There was a lot of money to be made" in forecasting, especially of interest rates, said William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Temple University and chief consultant to the National Federation of Independent Business. "Now we know we can't do that."
That explains why the association, which has seen membership decline 10 percent over the last decade, is searching for a new identity.
"We are less and less an association of traditional members doing macroeconomics forecasting in a corporate center economic unit," said C. Mark Dadd of AT&T, the current president of the association. To reflect the new reality, the group just changed its name from the National Association "of Business Economists" to the National Association "for Business Economics."
Its new mission is to help members apply their economic skills to specific corporate problems rather than make grand but dubious pronouncements about the entire economy.
This somewhat humbler ambition seemed especially striking when set against the opening address on Monday by Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, who declared the stellar performance of the economy to be a triumph of national economic policy making rather than favorable circumstances and improved corporate competitiveness.
"The conventional explanations," he said, "do not recognize the central role of the monetary policy the Fed has made over the past 17 years and the more recent contribution of improved fiscal policy."
At other sessions, one speaker after another concentrated on practical ways for economists to "add value," enhancing their careers by filling such specialty niches as litigation analysis and transfer pricing or adopting strategies for turning themselves into executives.
In the end, several economists noted, they are victims of the very market forces that the profession so often exults. And with the market changing, economists must change, too.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The latest move by China toward capitalism: Is it real?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
KARL MARX envisioned the withering away of the state as the final stage of the socialist revolution. But it is unlikely he had in mind today's China, where President Jiang Zemin just broadened the definition of "public ownership" to include publicly held private companies and announced that the vast majority of state-owned enterprises would soon be left to the fate of the free market.
What Mr. Jiang meant is not yet clear. "Everybody's calling it 'privatization,' which may not be the case," cautioned Robert Dernberger, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. "All we really know is that Jiang made it politically correct to sell shares" in all but a handful of enterprises. 
 But Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, thinks he sees the writing on the wall. "They've reached the conclusion that state ownership won't work; China is now committed to free markets," he concluded.
China has been experimenting with its own eclectic mix of capitalism and socialism since 1979. The first step was the liberalization of agriculture, replacing communes with long-term land leases. That permitted peasants to keep the proceeds from their extra production, nearly duplicating the incentives of private enterprise while maintaining state ownership of land. And it paid off: while farm output grew by 5 percent annually from 1978 to 1995, the portion of the work force on farms fell to 53 percent from 72 percent.
In the second wave of near-capitalist reforms, small, community-owned industrial enterprises were permitted to blossom, absorbing much of the labor freed by productivity gains in agriculture. "Special economic zones" -- free markets, by another name -- were created in southern coastal cities. And their success induced some 90 other cities to demand partial exemption from Beijing's rules on labor, taxes and foreign investment.
Strikingly, though, the growth of free enterprise did not come at the expense of the socialist sector. Always viewed by the Communist leadership as its political base, state-owned industry has been coddled with Government orders and capital.
Thus, while the portion of gross domestic product generated by the state fell to just 34 percent in 1994, from 78 percent in 1978, both employment and output in Government enterprises actually grew. Today (as in the early 1980's) roughly one Chinese adult in five works for the state.
But the state sector is hardly healthy. Since the mid-1980's, managers have been granted freedom to produce what they want and sell it for what the market will bear -- as long as they maintained the "iron rice bowl" guarantees of employment and minimum living standards. The catch, argues Harry Broadman, a senior economist at the World Bank, is that enterprises rarely confronted a "hard budget constraint."
State enterprises got to convert the fruits of their successes into wages and bonuses, but were bailed out with loans or direct subsidies when they failed. Indeed, the neither-fish-nor-fowl character of the state enterprises produced much the effect that "perestroika" had in the last days of the Soviet Union: managers routinely played the system by taking out loans they could not repay, counting unsalable products as inventory -- or simply sold off assets to meet expenses.
The big difference, Mr. Sachs argues, is that China could carry its state sector because the business sector outside the state was so large and growing so rapidly. Why, then, the latest, seemingly radical pronouncements on reform?
One possibility is that President Jiang is bluffing in hopes of getting managers to shape up. But there are reasons to believe Beijing no longer has the room to reverse course that it had in the 1980's.
Wing Thye Woo, an economist at the University of California at Davis, predicts that "asset-stripping by managers will accelerate" once they discover "this is their last chance to steal." Hence, a reversion to direct state control would mean a serious loss of face for the leadership -- or worse, charges of corruption.
Equally important, Mr. Dernberger of the Center for Chinese Studies suggests, a subsidy-as-usual approach no longer represents a safe political alternative. While it may be possible to sustain the iron rice bowl for urban industrial workers, half-measures will not narrow the growing disparity in living standards between the socialist north and the capitalist south.
Besides, Mr. Sachs argues, the chance of unrest once state enterprises are left on their own has been exaggerated. He estimates that no more than 3 percent of the work force would lose jobs in a rapid restructuring -- a modest number compared with unemployment in the transition economies in Russia and its former satellites.
Indeed, Mr. Broadman sees this as the moment for China's canny, survival-oriented leaders to seize the day. "With the economy booming," he said, "they can afford the hard decisions."

HEADLINE: Federal Agency Is Proposing Regulation for Mortgage Brokers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The mortgage broker initially told Erick and Barbara Barbosa that their interest rate on a 30-year loan for the $78,000 house they were buying in North Miami Beach would be 8.75 percent. At closing, he told them it had jumped to 9.5 percent because interest rates were rising.
"I was amazed at how fast it went up," Mr. Barbosa said. 
 Several weeks later, the Barbosas learned from their lawyer that interest rates in general had not increased at all -- that, for a consideration, the broker had steered the Barbosas to a lender charging a higher rate.
With the number of transactions like that increasing each year, the Housing Department today announced that it was proposing a regulation to require mortgage brokers to declare in writing whom they represent -- the buyer, a lender or both -- when a buyer seeks the broker's help.
"Too often consumers think the brokers are working for them," Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said at a news conference with the Barbosas. "In reality, they are working against them."
Mortgage brokers are a relatively new element of home buying, playing a major role only in the last decade. In theory, a broker shops around to find a buyer the best possible deal and receives a fee at closing as part of the settlement, usually a small percentage of the mortgage or a flat sum.
Jan Hix, president of the National Mortgage Brokers Association, said her group how has 52,000 members, and according to Housing Department data, they were involved in half of the country's 3 million mortgage transactions last year, handling about $333 billion in deals.
Mr. Cuomo said the new regulation is needed because "a small number of bad brokers are scamming the system" by driving up purchasing costs for home buyers, costing them thousands of extra dollars over the term of the mortgage.
The Barbosas, who sued the broker and renegotiated their mortgage as part of a settlement, the terms of which they would not disclose, said the higher interest rate would have cost them $18,000 over the term of the mortgage.
Under the proposed rule, which must survive Congressional review to go into effect, a mortgage broker would indicate all sources of fees and what exactly those fees will be.
By refusing, Mr. Cuomo said, the broker would be presumed to be in violation of the 1974 Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act for charging excessive fees. That is punishable by penalties of up to a year in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Ms. Hix said she "did not think much" of the proposal, since her association adopted a similar -- but voluntary -- guideline for brokers three months ago. She also said the association had not received a single complaint over broker practices and she was unaware of any complaints filed with state real estate boards.
"We have already taken steps to address this issue," she said in a telephone conference call with reporters. "We have a model disclosure form, urging members to describe how they are compensated."
While implementation of the regulation could take several months, Mr. Cuomo said the department had set up a telephone number for prospective mortgage buyers to call with any questions about brokers. It is 1-800-217-6970.

HEADLINE: Starts of Housing Dropped by 4.8% in August

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Housing construction unexpectedly dropped in August as builders started projects at the slowest pace this year, though the broad economy shows few signs of losing its steady-growth, low-inflation rhythm.
Housing starts fell 4.8 percent last month to an annualized 1.363 million, Commerce Department figures showed today, suggesting that a decline in mortgage rates had yet to rekindle demand for new homes. Permits for new construction also dropped, and July's total of housing starts was revised lower, showing a decline of almost 5 percent. 
 A separate Federal Reserve report signaled that labor shortages had yet to translate into rising consumer or industrial prices. Bond investors welcomed the news as further evidence of slower growth that would keep inflation in check and give the Fed little reason to raise borrowing costs.
In the housing report, all regions of the nation reported fewer starts, with the Northeast accounting for the greatest decline. Last December was the last time new construction came in this low, falling to an annual pace of 1.353 million.
Builders are cautious because the number of prospective buyers is declining, though sales have yet to slow. "The demand for homes seems to still be there, but in the past three weeks there has been a considerable slide in traffic," said Lori Steiner, vice president of Dominion Homes. "It could be because people are busy getting their kids back into school, but we're watching that trend."
Even so, the pace of new-housing starts for the first eight months of the year -- 1.449 million -- remains close to the eight-year high of 1.476 million recorded in 1996.
The Federal Reserve -- in its latest regional economic outlook, known as the beige book -- said that "with a few exceptions, prices for goods are said to be moving very little, if at all, at the manufacturing level for inputs or finished goods, and at the retail level." Labor shortages, though widespread, "are not translating into generally higher wages," the Fed survey said.
Those findings suggest that the central bank is in no hurry to raise interest rates. Its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee next meets on Sept. 30.
While growth continued in all 12 Federal Reserve districts, "some districts note signs of slowing in selected sectors," the survey said. "About half the districts say their overall pace picked up in July and August while the others report continued moderate growth."
The regional-outlook survey is based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks. It is published eight times a year. The latest edition was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, with the information collected before Sept. 8.
Also pointing to subdued growth and low inflation, new figures from the American Bankers Association today showed an almost 4 percent rise in late credit-card payments in the second quarter, while the Labor Department said that import prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in August.
The Commerce Department report suggests that the "housing market has topped out," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, and unless low mortgage rates start it back up, "it looks like it's going to subtract from third-quarter growth."
Mortgage rates, a key ingredient in whether people buy homes, continued to decline in August, though by the end of the month they had again risen a bit.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.48 percent in August, down slightly from 7.50 percent in July. That put the average principal and interest payment on a $100,000 loan at $697.85 last month, down from $699.21 in July.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Overall Growth, Tight Labor Markets"
A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
 
Minneapolis -- Consumers spent more, new-home construction increased and manufacturers' orders were swelling.
 
Chicago -- Consumer spending picked up and manufacturing continued to grow. Labor markets remained tight.
 
Cleveland -- Business activity remained stable at a high level. Reports of labor shortages have become more prevalent.
 
Boston -- Sales rose at many companies. Wages increased at retailers and factories.
 
New York -- Retailers reported mixed results for August. Housing markets continued moderate improvement.
 
Philadelphia -- Manufacturers gained in orders and shipments, and retail sales increased modestly.
 
Richmond -- Manufacturing expanded more rapidly, but retail sales and services slowed somewhat.
 
Atlanta -- Retail sales continued to exceed last year's levels, and the housing market held steady.
 
St. Louis -- Retailers and car dealers saw a consumer spending rise. Labor markets were getting tighter.
 
Kansas City -- Manufacturing was strong and retail sales increased. Labor markets remained tight with little evidence of rising wages.
 
Dallas -- Economic activity expanded with a continued labor shortage, which increased wages in a few industries. Retail sales picked up.
 
San Francisco -- Economy grew at a rapid pace. Retail sales picked up and service industries maintained a high level of activity. A shortage of skilled labor continued.

HEADLINE: With or Without U.S., Latin Trade Group Is Marching Forward

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 17

 BODY:
After years of backstage rivalry between Brazil and the United States over which country's vision will shape the rules of trade in this part of the hemisphere, a high-level economic conference here has emerged as a coming-out party for Mercosur, a Brazilian-led South American trade group.
Leaders who spoke before the World Economic Forum, a business-financed research group that met last week in Sao Paulo, acknowledged the advances Mercosur had made in promoting regional trade. They also noted that the United States had done little to advance President Clinton's 1994 pledge at the Summit of the Americas in Miami to create a "Free Trade Area of the Americas from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego" by 2005. 
 "I don't want to rule out the Free Trade Area of the Americas," President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina said in his opening address to the group, "but charity begins at home."
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, also noted that trade was soaring among the four Mercosur members -- Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay -- and that the alliance was signing accords with the European Union and the Andean Pact, a trade group in western South America.
"Mercosur is not a stage toward a Free Trade Area of the Americas," he said. "It is an end in itself."
Mr. Lampreia said that Brazil now buys 30 percent of Argentina's exports and that Argentina sells more to Brazil than to the United States. In just a few years, Mr. Menem said, Argentina's trade with Mercosur countries has grown fivefold, to 20 percent of its total trade.
President Clinton's so-called fast-track authority -- the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress can accept or reject but not amend -- expired three years ago. The White House announced last week that the fight was on to restore it, and on Tuesday Mr. Clinton forwarded a bill to the House. Administration officials are arguing that Mercosur and other regional trade groups will make deals that exclude the United States unless the President can negotiate new trade agreements without Congressional involvement.
The President's special envoy for Latin American and Caribbean affairs, Thomas F. McLarty, visited the Sao Paulo meeting and indicated Washington's qualified acceptance of Mercosur, which he described as one of "many paths to achieving a Free Trade Area of the Americas."
He avoided the question of Mercosur's role in any future Free Trade Area of the Americas. But the growth of Mercosur appears to have posed more urgent questions for Washington than whose trade pact will prevail in 2005.
"Americans must be aware that trade liberalization is taking place at a very fast pace in the Americas," said Alvaro Garcia, the Chilean Economic Minister, "and any country that is not part of that is losing out."
Mr. Garcia said Chile had signed free trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, and had also joined Mercosur as an associate member. As a result, companies from those countries can compete on more favorable terms for Chilean contracts than American companies can.
Mr. Garcia noted that recent privatization contracts had gone to Canadian companies because United States concerns would face an 11 percent tariff on equipment they brought in.
In an allusion to the United States and the Miami meeting, Mr. Garcia added, "The only actor that's been absent until now has been the host of the summit."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise Somewhat on Congenial Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were mostly higher yesterday, buoyed by weak housing-start figures for August and a friendly Federal Reserve report on business conditions.
Still, ebbs and flows in trading were prevalent throughout the session, as advances were often stymied by investors' seemingly balking at the higher prices that resulted from Monday's sharp rally and the consolidation of those gains by others investors. Many in the market are waiting for figures beyond Monday's Consumer Price Index to justify any further moves higher. 
 Stephanie Davis, fixed-income analyst at Technical Data of Boston, said: "Today's data did not provide any fresh incentives for the market. The market politely accepted yesterday's rally off of C.P.I. data, and sentiment remains bullish as we await the next big move." That may not come until next week's report on durable-goods orders, she said.
The 30-year bond rose 7/32 to a price of 99 26/32 to yield 6.39 percent, down from 6.41 percent on Tuesday.
Bond buying gained impetus early in the session when the Commerce Department reported that new-home construction fell 4.8 percent in August to an annualized 1.363 million units. That was lower than the 1.450 million some economists had expected and the lowest monthly pace of the year.
Some analysts said that the housing statistics should be considered an aberration until proved otherwise. Others, however, said that the weaker August housing starts had not been signaled by traditional indicators like interest rates, personal income and consumer confidence and home-mortgage applications. Rather, they were signaled by falling residential-construction contracts.
"At this juncture," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "virtually all market participants are expecting the Fed to keep monetary policy unchanged at its Sept. 30 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Indeed, the economy's forward momentum has not yet produced any corresponding lift in inflation, and until there is a translation from strong economic growth to increasing inflationary pressures, Fed policy will likely remain stationary."
The Fed last raised short-term interest rates in March, when the target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, was increased to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.
Yesterday afternoon's release by the Fed of its beige book report on regional business conditions caused bonds to advance further into positive territory, as investors got a glimpse of what the Fed will have in hand when its monetary-policy committee meets on Sept. 30.
The report indicated that continuing economic growth would create little wage or price pressure. "While in reality, the beige book was for the most part a verbal description of the economic data already released over the past few weeks," Mr. Fine said, "the market found it reassuring nevertheless."
Also yesterday, the Treasury announced the size of note auctions next week, which were left unchanged, with $15.5 billion of two-year securities being sold on Tuesday and an $11.5 billion offering of five-year notes Wednesday. In when-issued trading ahead of the sales, the two-year issue was offered at a price to yield 5.78 percent, and the five-year at a price to yield 5.96 percent.

HEADLINE: An Old School Inflation Fighter;
Fed Official Resists Notion of a New Era in Economics

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Inflation is almost nonexistent despite steady growth and an unemployment rate hovering near a quarter-century low. Companies are chalking up ever-higher profits. Millions of investors are basking in the glow of the longest, strongest bull market on record. Even curmudgeons like Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, are increasingly optimistic that the economy is undergoing a transformation that should yield more good times ahead.
So who would dare to rain on the parade? 
 Larry Meyer might, for one. Mr. Meyer, one of Mr. Greenspan's fellow governors on the Federal Reserve Board, has emerged as one of the most outspoken and influential of those disputing the notion that the economy has entered a new era in which old rules about the interplay among growth, unemployment and inflation are becoming less reliable and less relevant.
In doing so, Mr. Meyer is subtly but unmistakably challenging some of the views held by Mr. Greenspan, whose thinking so dominates monetary policy that it is rarely questioned in public by other Fed officials.
Yet at the same time, Fed officials said, Mr. Meyer's role as an intellectual foil for Mr. Greenspan has helped invigorate the debate within the central bank over some of the most critical issues of the day.
And they said that by articulating the cautious, traditionalist view, Mr. Meyer was acting as a powerful anchor at the Fed. That gives Mr. Greenspan greater leeway to show Congress and the public that the central bank takes seriously the possibility that the economy's ability to grow faster without inflation has been permanently improved by factors like corporate America's huge investments in technology.
Laurence H. Meyer, 53, is a Bronx native who joined the Fed last year largely unknown to the general public but with a reputation as one of the nation's most brilliant economic forecasters. He says that the economy's stellar performance of late may require tweaking some rules that have long governed interest-rate policy, but by no means invalidates them.
Reduced to its simplest form, his argument is that there is little evidence so far to overturn what has long been a central tenet of policy making at the Fed: If the economy grows faster than around 2.2 percent a year for a sustained period when unemployment is low and factories are running near full tilt, it will eventually ignite inflation, threaten the continuation of the expansion and require raising interest rates to cool things off.
Just today, in a speech in Pittsburgh, Mr. Meyer emphasized that the Fed could not afford to ignore the lessons economists have gleaned from the past in assessing whether the present has changed so much that it promises a rosier future.
"There are limits," Mr. Meyer said. "They may not be the old limits that disciplined policy in the past. But even if the limits are new, they must be respected. Overheating is a natural product of expansions that overtax these limits. Recessions typically follow overheating. Good policy must therefore balance regularities and possibilities."
As a sparring match, the intellectual face-off between Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Meyer is not much. There is no animosity between the men, and their statements on the subject are directed at answering the most vexing question to face policy makers in years, rather than at each other.
Their debate is couched in the dense reasoning and cautious language used by Fed officials whenever they speak publicly. And despite their differing perspectives, Mr. Meyer has voted in lockstep with Mr. Greenspan on whether and when to change interest rate policy, and seems likely to continue doing so.
But Mr. Meyer is the only member of the Fed's policy making body other than Mr. Greenspan to have spent his career dissecting the business cycle and rooting out clues to incipient inflation. And he is the only one to have delivered a series of carefully constructed defenses of the rules and equations that economists have long used to track inflation risks from strong growth and declining unemployment.
"Larry Meyer is somebody who's worthy to challenge Chairman Greenspan's breadth and scope of knowledge on monetary policy," said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decisions Economics. "He provides a check on the power that Chairman Greenspan may hold over the Fed in terms of his knowledge of the nitty-gritty and his presumed forecasting power."
Some analysts believe Mr. Meyer is consciously positioning himself to become the Fed board's most determined inflation fighter in an effort to vault himself over the central bank's vice chairwoman, Alice M. Rivlin, as the leading inside candidate to succeed Mr. Greenspan.
But Fed officials said that was unlikely, and Mr. Meyer has told colleagues he does not consider himself to have any chance at the job.
Still, Mr. Meyer's willingness to stake out a clear position is one manifestation of how the conundrum over what is happening to the economy has upset the traditional roles within the Fed. Mr. Greenspan, a Republican who was long viewed as a dogmatic, uncompromising inflation fighter, has emerged in the last year as far more pragmatic and patient in assessing possible changes than either his supporters or critics would have believed a year ago.
Mr. Meyer and, to a lesser extent, Mrs. Rivlin have been far more cautious. They were both appointed to the Fed last year by President Clinton, who had suggested not long before he nominated them that he was intrigued by the argument that the nation's potential to grow faster without worsening inflation was higher than most mainstream economists believed.
In speaking up, Mr. Meyer is reflecting growing frustration among many prominent economists that the speculation about a New Age Economy -- fueled in part by Mr. Greenspan's public flirtation with the idea -- has simply gone too far.
"Whatever one calls it, this new view of the economy has spread with a rapidity rare in the annals of economic thought," Paul Krugman, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a recent article in The Harvard Business Review. "There is only one problem: when you think about it carefully, you realize that the new paradigm simply does not make sense."
In many ways, Mr. Meyer has been preparing for this debate his entire career. After receiving a B.A. at Yale University in 1965 and a doctorate in economics at M.I.T. in 1970, he went on to teach at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1982 he founded Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a consulting firm that soon became known for its sophisticated computer forecasting model of the American economy.
When he joined the Fed, he was initially taken aback at the power of the platform he had been given; he still winces when recalling how even his banal public statements moved the financial markets. But he has appeared increasingly comfortable lately in using his position to advance his argument -- both to the public and to other Fed members, who communicate remarkably little among themselves outside their eight meetings a year on monetary policy.
While Mr. Greenspan closely studies a combination of long-term historical trends and immediate indicators of what is happening in the real world -- one recent favorite of his has been the rate at which people voluntarily leave their jobs -- Mr. Meyer tends to put more trust in broad formulas.
In particular, Mr. Meyer remains a defender of a concept known as the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu. It holds that if the rate of unemployment falls below a certain level and stays under the line, that wages, and ultimately prices, too, will begin to rise. And if the economy continues to grow faster than what many analysts consider its "speed limit" -- 2.2 percent or so annually -- such an increase in inflation is almost unavoidable.
Mr. Meyer, like many other economists, long pegged the Nairu at about 6 percent. With unemployment now running below 5 percent and no signs of inflation in sight, he has lately lowered his estimate to around 5.5 percent. Still, even though the level may be flexible depending on changes in labor markets and other long-term factors, he insists that there is no reason to believe that the concept is any less valid than it has ever been. The same is true, he said, of the Phillips curve, an equation that economists use to predict how fast inflation will accelerate as unemployment falls.
"It is possible that the Phillips curve and Nairu is simply the wrong analytical framework, but I doubt it and am not aware of another model of inflation dynamics that is ready to take its place," Mr. Meyer said in his speech today.
The implication is that Mr. Meyer believes that the economy has been growing well above its noninflationary potential -- a trend that if continued would ultimately create inflationary pressures.
Mr. Greenspan, by contrast, has long expressed doubts about Nairu, and has stressed recently the need for policy makers to be flexible in how they assess the economy.
"We are constantly evaluating how much we can infer from the past and how relationships might have changed," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech at Stanford University earlier this month. "In an ever-changing world, some element of discretion appears to be an unavoidable aspect of policy making."
The implication drawn by many analysts from Mr. Greenspan's position was that he would need some firmer evidence that inflation was on the verge of accelerating before he decided to raise interest rates -- and that formulas like Nairu by themselves did not provide that evidence.
Mr. Meyer, while willing to concede that some fundamental changes may be under way in the economy, strongly suggests that the biggest factors in explaining the current lack of inflation may be temporary, including the strong dollar, the reduction in the growth rate of health care costs, declining computer prices and low energy and food costs.
"Uncertainty about the source of the recent performance might be viewed as so great that the best course for monetary policy is a reactive posture, waiting for clear signs that inflation is rising and only tightening in response to such evidence," Mr. Meyer said. "I agree that the current uncertainty encourages caution, but not to the point of paralysis."

HEADLINE: Strong Dollar Taking a Toll On U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Fears that a strengthening dollar could undermine the growth in earnings of American companies in the third quarter have sent the stocks of some large multinational corporations reeling in recent weeks.
Shares of Eastman Kodak, Gillette, Coca-Cola and Polaroid have all been hit hard because of the impact of the dollar's rally. Earnings from abroad are reduced when they are converted at higher rates into dollars; at the same time, a stronger dollar can make American exports less competitive by raising their price in foreign currencies. 
 But many analysts contend that the declines and investor concerns may be overdone, which might help explain the stock market's recent volatility. Yesterday, things were calmer, with the Dow Jones industrial average off just 9.48 points, to 7,886.44.
The dollar has been strong for some time, these analysts note, and thus its impact has already been factored into earnings forecasts. Also, not that many companies beyond the major multinationals receive a large part of their revenue from overseas operations. And of those that do, some use hedging to minimize the risk of losses from currency fluctuations.
Such companies also tend to offer brand-name products that are not easily copied and are in high demand, which can help offset upward moves in the dollar.
"The true currency impact is not going to be more than a few cents," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. As a result, Ms. Cohen said, she has not changed her operating earnings estimate for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index this year even in the face of the dollar's rally.
Analysts also argue that much of the selling tied to a stronger dollar may actually be a response to the high prices reached by popular blue-chip stocks in comparison to their promised earnings. In other words, the dollar has been an excuse to get out.
"The dollar has been doing what it's been doing for a while," said Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities. "The market was due for a pause or a little bit of a correction -- not because of the dollar, but because of the overvaluation, because of the quick move up without a corresponding move in fundamentals.
"But I think something gets blamed for it, and the dollar was a good thing to blame," she said.
So far this year, the dollar is up 4.5 percent against the Japanese yen and 14.9 percent against the the German mark. The rally against the yen has been very volatile, with the dollar up as much as 9.8 percent before a sharp slide in May. It has rebounded some since. Against the mark, the dollar moved higher all year, rising as much as 22 percent, until a recent slide that has seen it fall 5.8 percent.
But what has focused most of the recent investor attention on the dollar was the sudden collapse this summer of Southeast Asian currencies and the consequent jump in the dollar. Against the Thai baht, the dollar is up 48 percent since July 2; it has also risen 19.4 percent against the Malaysian ringgit.
These moves have had their impact. But often the companies that have been hurt do not hedge -- or hedge only minimally -- against sudden swings in the dollar's value.
The most recent casualty was Polaroid, which does only a little hedging. Polaroid's stock fell 6 percent Tuesday after it said that a stronger dollar would hold third-quarter earnings to less than analyst estimates and would reduce profits. "The dollar just moved too quickly for us," Nancy Childs, a spokeswoman for Polaroid, said. Hedging, she added "didn't help us in this quarter." Yesterday, Polaroid shares stabilized, slipping only 1/16, to 51 15/16.
The stock of Kodak, which has abandoned the hedging for which it was well known in the 1980's, has plunged 13.9 percent since the company said on Monday that its share of the United States film business was slipping and that the rising dollar would hurt profits. Yesterday, its shares fell 5/8, to 56 3/8.
Kodak had similar dollar problems earlier this year. That announcement knocked the stock down 10.5 percent in a single trading session, on March 21.
But other companies having dollar problems do not seem to be paying such a price with investors. The Chrysler Corporation hedges some exposure to the yen by purchasing parts made in Japan for use in the cars it sells there, said Van Bussmann, a Chrysler economist.
But, excluding Australia and New Zealand, Chrysler has seen sales in the Asia-Pacific region decline by 22 percent through the end of August as the rising dollar increased the price of Chrysler's cars, he said. Yet, its share price rose 3/16 yesterday, to 37 1/4 -- a level less than half a point below its 1997 high.
And Microsoft is purposely risking a hit from the strong dollar, but has not been penalized as much as other companies. Microsoft shares are down 10.9 percent from their 1997 high, and yesterday fell 3 3/16, to 133 3/16. But they are up 61 percent for the year even as the company delays the introduction of the newest version of its Windows software.
Since the currency crisis in Southeast Asia, Microsoft has been selling its software products to local distributors in their home currencies, enduring any losses from the dollar's rise, said Orlando Ayala, a Microsoft senior vice president. He said that the company took a similar approach after the Mexican peso devaluation at the end of 1994 in hopes of keeping its market share. In that case, he said, Microsoft was able to maintain 40 percent sales growth in the region in 1994 and 1995.
So while some companies have been hit, the overall picture of expectations for the S.& P. 500 has not changed significantly.
According to earnings estimates gathered by the First Call Corporation, operating earnings for the S.& P. 500 are expected to grow 12.4 percent in the third quarter and 13.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Estimates have declined modestly in recent weeks but that is a normal trend as the reporting period approaches.

HEADLINE: Clinging to Its Past, Europe Is Warily Awaiting the Euro

SERIES: CHANGING MONEY: First of two articles

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: MOSBURG, Germany

 BODY:
Franz Schmid is old enough to have suffered his share of European upheaval, and now, as the century wanes, he is convinced that the Continent is on the brink of another disaster, one that will wipe out all he has slowly built from the ruins of Hitler's war.
A retired hairdresser with a solid house beside a Bavarian brook, Mr. Schmid experienced the inflationary chaos that gave Hitler his start. He was drafted into the German army and captured on the Russian front. When he put his life together after 1945, rising early, never taking a vacation, it was the rock-solid German mark that measured his passage to a modest affluence. 
 His conclusion: play with currencies and you play with fire. So, like about 60 percent of his fellow Germans, he is alarmed by a plan to ditch the world's second-largest reserve currency, the mark, and use a new money to change Europe. "The mark is part of us," Mr. Schmid said. "What do we need a worthless new money for?"
But several European governments -- including Germany's -- appear ready to scrap their national currencies and replace them with a single money, the euro, by 1999. They are set to impose the currency on restive, sometimes openly hostile, citizens, for whom union has become synonymous with stagnation and sacrifice. The political risk is enormous.
That risk is being taken with a bold aim: to forge greater European unity in an attempt to arrest the continent's relative decline in an American-dominated world. "There is nothing more political than money," said Richard Descoings, director of the French Institute of Political Studies. "Once each person has a euro in his pocket, the money will unite us as Americans are bound by the dollar."
But this has been a lousy decade in Europe. Unemployment is at levels not seen since the 1930's. Over the past five years, growth averaged little more than 1 percent, less than half the American level. The globalization embraced by the United States has struck fear into the European soul; war in Bosnia has shaken the continent.
For some time now, Europe has labored under a dread conviction that Asia is rising, America roaring along, while the old Continent sleeps amid its predatory ghosts.
The euro is potent medicine for this malaise. Each country that joins the common currency will surrender part of its national sovereignty by turning over key economic decisions to a European Central Bank in Frankfurt. This bank will set interest rates and impose a fiscal discipline so strict that a profound reshaping of Europe's costly welfare state appears inevitable.
In the United States, too, there is a broad push to reshape welfare programs. But Europe is a customs union, not a country, and the cuts in spending required by adoption of the euro result from the planning of faceless central bankers rather than an election in which one vision for the future has trumped another.
Skeptics worry that the architects of the euro are inviting disaster by imposing a single economic policy on diverse countries with vastly differing traditions, national identities and economic philosophies. But supporters insist that this surrender of national sovereignty is the only way for Europe to challenge the United States' global economic power, closing the American century with an act of European emancipation.
"The euro has come to be seen as a thing imposed by an elite," said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French Finance Minister, "but it is the only way to make Europe strong in the decades to come."
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, already in the history books as the helmsman of German reunification, thinks he has a vision that will immortalize him a second time: end a bloody century -- in which Europe twice ripped itself to shreds and the United States twice came to its rescue -- by creating a single money in a market of 372 million people. Which will usher in a united Europe with a united Germany at its heart.
To reassure his fellow Europeans once and for all about his country's intentions, Mr. Kohl stands ready to sacrifice the country's best-loved symbol, the mark. It is an extraordinary political step -- akin to suggesting that the surrender of the American flag might somehow be in its people's interest. The euro will rise or fall with Germany, which accounts for 25 percent of the European Union's total output.
The outcome remains very much in doubt. The euro is to become Europe's money on Jan. 1, 1999. Will it bring strength or chaos, unity or renewed outbursts of European nationalism, as a Frankfurt bank becomes the scapegoat for massive unemployment?
 
Love, Hate and the Euro
Feared as Currency, Favored as Strategy
Faces at the European Commission in Brussels tend to light up at the euro's potential to spur Europe's economy. But Mr. Schmid, the retired hairdresser, sees folly where so-called Eurocrats see fortune.
His fears are those of the average German burgher. He has given some of his savings in marks to his son, Toni, to change into dollars. He equates the dollar's 20 percent appreciation against the mark over the past year with the mark's looming demise.
Franz Schmid was 12 years old when, in 1923, inflation reached more than two billion percent. To buy $1, 4.2 trillion marks were needed. In the same year, the young Adolf Hitler was arrested after he tried to lead a march on Berlin.
His family ruined, Franz was sent to work as an apprentice to a barber, only to be drafted into Hitler's army just as he had acquired his first hairdressing salon and was beginning to make his way.
Poland, France, Russia: Mr. Schmid invaded them all, an ordinary German swept along in a tide. Then, in 1944, he was captured by the Red Army and taken to a prison camp in Siberia. On carts in summer, on sleds in winter, he carried corpses out to woods where the wolves ate them. Only his skills in cutting Soviet officers' hair saved him.
A second lesson in the vagaries of money awaited him on his return to a devastated Germany in 1947. His life savings -- a bank deposit of 1,500 Reichsmarks -- were worthless, devoured by the inflationary financing of the war. Dollars alone, sent by two sisters who had emigrated to New York, bought him food until a new currency, the Deutsche mark, was introduced on June 20, 1948.
"The new currency was hope, the first hope, really," Mr. Schmid said. "I got married eight days later, and the photographer asked for 100 marks, and that seemed a staggering amount. But with time, the mark became part of us. It was stable. Germany without the mark is not Germany! I feel I'm about to lose my money for the third time."
Mr. Schmid is now 86. But almost one-third of Germans are over 55, and even many younger people grew up in homes where old, devalued Reichsmark bills were kept as symbols of money's vulnerability. It is, at the root, fear of chaos that leads 60 percent of Germans to say they oppose the euro project.
"It is amazing how deep the trauma goes," said Hans-Georg Gerstenlauer, the European Commission's representative in Berlin and an enthusiastic supporter of the euro. "I remember my parents talking repeatedly about hyperinflation, and they were infants when it happened."
During an interview, Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, talked repeatedly -- almost obsessively -- about the "sustainability" of monetary union: that is, the question whether Germany's low inflation and solid currency can be enduringly extended to the European Union. He repeatedly expressed concern that the euro might be blamed for the continent's economic woes. He seemed to be fighting his own doubts.
In the end, Germany fears the euro as money but favors it as strategic salvation. This country is, on some levels, is still trying to persuade wary neighbors that its nationalism was buried with the Third Reich.
"We are looking for a different identity because nationalism is really taboo," said Walter Hasselkus, the German chief executive of Rover. "That identity is Europe."
 
The Case for the Euro
Unshackling Europe To Take On the U.S.
The economic logic behind the plan is simple. "What," asked Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the French Central Bank, "would the single American market be without a single money in Texas and California?"
In other words, the European Union's single market in goods and services is incomplete without a single currency and will be invigorated by having one. Over 60 percent of the trade of European Union states is with other countries in the union: the euro will simplify and stimulate this trade.
Like many European executives, Horst Teltschik, a member of the executive board of BMW, the German auto maker, sees the case for the new money as self-evident: "We export one-third of our production to other European Union countries, "and we've suffered a lot from exchange rate fluctuation. The euro will eliminate that risk."
For example, since BMW bought the British Rover auto company three years ago, sterling has appreciated more than 10 percent against the mark. As a result, the new Rover dealerships opened by BMW in Germany are having difficulties. "We should raise Rover prices to match the mark's level," Mr. Teltschik said, "but we can't, so for now we take losses."
Of course, companies trading between New York and Phoenix do not face such fluctuations. In this sense, the euro is intended to make Europe more like America. Corporations including Siemens and Unilever have made clear that they believe they will benefit greatly from the change.
Executives say that business will be spurred by easier corporate planning, pricing and billing. European financial markets will be opened up to new competition; inefficient policies will be less sustainable; pressure will rise on countries to make their economies attractive to business. The dollar will at last have a real rival.
The union's economy is roughly the same size as America's; it accounts for 20.9 percent of world trade, more than the United States' 19.6 percent; its population is bigger by about 100 million people, providing the largest single market in the world.
Why, therefore, should the euro not eventually make strong inroads into the dollar's international dominance, expressed in the fact that the dollar is the currency for close to 60 percent of international trade and 80 percent of financial operations?
Imagine oil priced in euros rather than dollars. Imagine the United States no longer able to assume that its deficits are automatically financed because the world wants dollars. Imagine Europe one day showing the same "benign neglect" for the euro that America does for the dollar because the domestic European market will be so big.
Such visions are by no means shared by everyone. "A German racket to take over the whole of Europe," was what Nicholas Ridley, a former British Industry Minister, once called the euro. The remark was revealing of a corner of the British psyche. Abstruse and abstract, but as intimate as the coins in a pocket, the euro beams a spotlight into the diverse recesses of the European heart.
Up to now, Britain, Denmark and Sweden have indicated that they will probably not join the planned "first wave" because of their reservations about the project. To these countries, the economics look too risky and the politics of a formal abandonment of national sovereignty too sensitive. But they may join later.
The United States has its doubts as well, although European integration has been in the American interest for more than 40 years. It has provided a steady opening of markets on which American corporations from I.B.M. to Toys 'R' Us have thrived. It has been a bedrock of America's postwar emergence as a European power.
"Important as monetary union is," said Lawrence H. Summer, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, "we sometimes have an impression of an introverted Europe, of navel-gazing."
Richard C. Holbrooke, a former Ambassador to Germany and Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, was blunter: "Almost a decade has gone by since the Berlin wall fell and, instead of reaching out to Central Europe, the European Union turned toward a bizarre search for a common currency. So NATO enlargement had to fill the void. Tell me, would you leave your money in German marks if the mark is going to become the lira and you can move to the dollar?"
Italy, however, is eager to dissolve itself and its lira into Europe as soon as possible. "We've always had a healthy inferiority complex here about tall, blond people," said Luigi Spaventa, a former Budget Minister. "For us, it's the euro or Africa." In Portugal and Spain, where a decade of membership in the European Union has been synonymous with the end of dictatorship and the advent of prosperity, the euro is similarly coveted.
France is ambivalent. It cares little for the franc. Moreover, in the heady days of the Cold War's end, it was France that exacted a commitment from Germany to adopt the euro as a condition for reunification. The strategic desire to harness German economic power inalienably to French political ambitions remains. But the cession of sovereignty that the euro entails raises the specter of an end to "La France."
In Britain, the ripples of Mr. Ridley's remark have not entirely faded. Tony Blair's Labor Government has called for a sober look at the euro. But unease persists about loss of sovereignty to a bank in Germany and the less flexible economic model of continental Europe. The Conservative Party has torn itself apart over the issue.
To attempt to marry such diversity by creating a European money may appear the folly of this fin de siecle. "Kohl wants the euro for the history books," said Denis Tillinac, a French writer. "But why must we pay for his obsessions? You can share a home, you can even persuade people to eat together, but you can't force them to make love."
 
The Case Against the Euro
In Monetary Policy, Can One Size Fit All?
The political theory in Paris and Bonn is that you can. As Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, put it, "Why not try to be great?"
Perhaps the answer is because it can be dangerous. Historically, monetary union has usually followed political union. The Federal Reserve was not established until 1913. Europe has opted to do things the other way around.
There is no European government, and peanuts would be a kind description of Europe's budget. Paltry would be an overgenerous portrayal of Europe's foreign policy. As the Bosnian war illustrated, political Europe is still as feeble as it is fragmented. The projected expansion of the union in the next century to bring in Poland and other Central European countries could cause yet more fragmentation.
By minting a money without making a government, and by surrendering control of monetary policy to a central bank while shunning the creation of other federal institutions, European states are heading into largely uncharted territory.
"This is the first time in history that the creation of a single money on a territory is not being accompanied by political centralization," said Olivier Klein, a French economist. "But money corresponds to a state power. And that is why we will have to move toward a more federal political structure in Europe."
Yet many European voters appear to despise the very federalism that the euro seems to promise. A recent cartoon in the daily Le Monde shows a despondent Frenchman. "Funny," he says, "We seemed to have more fun before Maastricht!"
Herein lies the paradox of the euro, a project sometimes suggestive of a journey begun so long ago that nobody can remember why a certain destination was chosen.
"We are going a new way in Europe," Mr. Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said. "I don't see a readiness for a European superstate with one tax system, one big central budget, one security system. I have to accept that. So the basic question is whether there is enough common ground for monetary union."
The planned European Central Bank will -- if the euro is broadly adopted -- set a single monetary policy from Rotterdam to Rome, from Berlin to Barcelona. National room for economic maneuver after Jan. 1, 1999, will be limited.
Thus, if Italy hits a recession as the Netherlands booms, Italian authorities will no longer be able to lower interest rates to stimulate activity. They will not be able to devalue the lira.
Italians are unlikely to migrate en masse to Amsterdam for jobs, as Americans might move to a booming Arizona from a depressed Vermont. Europeans, in general, do not like to move.
Nor will a European federal budget transfer resources to Italy, as the United States Federal budget transfers money to depressed areas through Medicare and Social Security payments.
Nor, finally, will there be room for generosity in national budgets, because of the new fiscal discipline: no deficits larger than 3 percent of output. This has been the Bundesbank's draconian condition.
Europe, in other words, had better be a truly convergent economy, more or less responsive to the same economic medicine from Helsinki to Lisbon, or there will be tensions that will find a readily available target in the European Central Bank.
"How will a Europe with the euro deal with regional recessions?" asked Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at M.I.T. "I would put the odds of a collapse at one in four."
It is easy enough to imagine, for example, the invective of a group of newly unemployed French citizens told in mid-1999 that the government is essentially powerless because of decisions made in Frankfurt. Rather than uniting Europe, an unstable euro in a depressed continent might easily spur new nationalisms. Currency speculators would be quick to seize on instability.
"One can certainly imagine potential disasters in the one-size-fits-all approach to monetary policy," Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said in an interview. "I am feeling nervous for the whole of Europe."
 
Germans and the Euro
Reclaiming Berlin, Learning From Bonn
Toni Schmid, the hairdresser's son, works for the Bavarian state government. He is nervous, too. But unlike his father, he may be more willing to accept the euro, however reluctantly. He sees that giving up the mark is the price for a united Europe to which Germany is irrevocably harnessed, a Europe whose economic policy is largely set by a bank in Frankfurt.
A member of the postwar generation, Mr. Schmid sees the euro as shaped less by the direct trauma of Nazism than by the angst of being German in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Born in 1950, he was a member of the first generation of Germans to go abroad after the war. Everywhere, the mark was the finest money. In Western Europe it was admired, in Eastern Europe coveted.
But respect was not the only thing encountered outside Germany. There was the realization, in Mr. Schmid's words, "that you were not normal." Your fathers had started the war and butchered millions of people. You had not chosen those fathers, but there it was. You were different.
On a visit to Ireland, Mr. Schmid recalled befriending a couple. He was French, she British. On parting, the woman said to him, "You know, it's really strange, I never thought I would have a German friend." The remark stuck in his mind.
And there, perhaps, lies the root of Germany's euro dilemma: a strong, much-loved money, the mark, on the one hand; an uncertain identity, a bad history, on the other.
A half-century after the war, the country, whole again, stands squarely at the center of Europe. Its economic domination is clear enough. The German economy is almost a third bigger than France's.
But Germany also has its doubts. And it knows -- especially since reunification -- that its allies need constant reassurance. Indeed, the euro was given a decisive push by unification. It was the most convincing reassurance, the most sweeping sacrifice, that Mr. Kohl could offer his neighbors.
There is a telling symmetry in the fact that the scheduled readoption of Berlin as German capital -- the return to the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate -- is set to coincide with the adoption of the euro in 1999. The reunification with Germany's past will thus be tied to the abandonment of the mark, the very emblem of German postwar strength. Put another away, Berlin will be reclaimed but with the lessons of Bonn.
"If you give away the mark you give away respect," Toni Schmid said, "and most Germans hate the idea. But Europe has been sacred for 50 years. No political party can say no to it. That is why Germans are not yelling."
Mr. Kohl is gambling that he can win over people like Mr. Schmid to his vision of aEurope where morale and growth can return to France and Germany, and where, perhaps, a new European identity can be born.
It will also be a place where interest policy reflects the interests of all European states.
The Bundesbank's insistence during much of the 1990's on high interest rates to tame the inflationary pressures of German reunification imparted a crippling blow to the economies of other European countries, which had to apply the same interest rates as the continent entered recession. The euro's image was thus battered.
The challenge facing the German Chancellor is therefore enormous, and German history offers a cautionary tale. The last German leader to embark on such far-reaching change was Bismarck, who declared the creation of the German Empire in 1871. His united Germany, bringing together 18 states, grew out of the customs union, or zollverein, between German states established in 1834, just as the euro seems set to emerge from European customs union.
Within 19 years of German unification, however, Bismarck was ousted. Mr. Kohl, who reunited Germany in 1989, has been in power 15 years. The vote he faces next year will hinge on the politics of the euro. Like Bismarck, Mr. Kohl may yet find that his countrymen's memory is short. "Kohl wants to be a European saint and he is ready to pay with the mark," said Toni Schmid. "But to many of us, the price looks too high."

Chart: "The Euro: A Primer"
In the Maastricht treaty of 1991, members of the European Union agreed to requirements and a timetable for abandoning national currencies and creating a common money called the euro.
 
WHO QUALIFIES
 
Countries must meet strict limits on several criteria, primarily:
 
DEFICITS -- must not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product, unless the deficit declined substantially and continuously, approaching 3 percent.
DEBT -- must not exceed 60 percent of total output unless it is approaching that level at a satisfactory rate.
INFLATION -- must not exceed the average of the three countries with the lowest inflation by more than 1.5 percent.
 
THE SCHEDULE
 
MAY 1998 -- European leaders decide which countries qualify. The bilateral exchange rates of the national currencies of those countries will then be set.
JAN. 1, 1999 -- The euro comes into existence, at fixed ratios to the national currencies, and becomes the instrument for issuing debt and making intergovernmental payments.
1999 TO 2002 -- National currencies continue to exist and are used for cash transactions. Euro notes and coins may be issued at any time between 1999 and 2002. National currencies go out of existence in 2002. (pg. A10)
 
Map/Chart: "The Euro Zone"
Not all European Union members are adopting the euro in 1999. Some may not qualify; others will wait. This will create a two-tier European Union. Map shows those in the euro zone and those outside: expected to qualify, improving chance of qualifying, waiting until later and will not qualify. 1996 population in millions, and gross domestic product in billions of U.S. dollars.

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans Criticize Clinton's Effort on Trade Accords

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's stance on international trade encountered intense opposition from important Senate Republicans today, only a day after it was denounced by House Democratic leaders.
Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, told the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, that the Administration's proposals were "in deep trouble" and stood no chance of passage. 
 "The present proposal does not seem to have very widespread support on either side of the aisle," Mr. Roth added. "What you have here before us is not going to develop the kind of coalition we need if we're going to be successful enacting legislation."
The dispute is over President Clinton's desire for authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can approve or disapprove but not amend. The Administration has hit fierce opposition over two issues, workers' rights and environmental standards. Mr. Clinton had wanted so-called fast-track authority to negotiate on those issues in trade agreements.
But organized labor and environmental groups have expressed fears about hastily negotiated trade deals that might hurt American workers. The labor unions and environmental groups have complained that American workers lose in competition with their counterparts in developing countries, where wages are far lower and environmental standards are likely to be more lax.
So Mr. Clinton on Tuesday pledged to negotiate separate side agreements on labor and environmental issues and to negotiate global agreements on those matters through the World Trade Organization and other international groups.
It was not clear today how much the President's shift softened the opposition of those Democrats and labor interests who want to see workers' rights and environmental standards at the center of any international trade pact and enforced by the possibility of sanctions.
What was clear today is that the Administration's proposals have angered some Republicans. One, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, said the changes proposed by Mr. Clinton could put Congress in the position of having to vote yes or no on right-to-work laws, which bar mandatory union membership.
And Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, told Ms. Barshefsky and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin that he would not allow the fast-track legislation to become "a vehicle for special-interest agendas, no matter how passionate their proponents may be."
Ms. Barshefsky told the Senators that the fast-track legislation was needed unless the United States was willing to "cede our leadership role with respect to the global economy."
This evening, an Administration official familiar with the fast-track issue said the President and Ms. Barshefsky would continue to work with both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.
"We see this as a first step in a long -- hopefully not too long -- process," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Every President since Gerald R. Ford has had fast-track authority. Mr. Clinton's expired two years ago. Anticipating that the issue would divide Democrats, he chose not to press for it as he headed into his re-election campaign.

Starts of Housing Decline As Inflation Stays in Check
Housing starts unexpectedly dropped 4.8 percent in August, to an annualized 1.363 million, as builders began projects at the slowest pace this year.
A report from the Federal Reserve showed that labor shortages have not translated into rising consumer or industrial prices. Both are further evidence of slower growth that will keep inflation in check and give the Fed little reason to raise interest rates. [Page D3.] 

Traders bid up Treasury prices in response to the economic data. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.39 percent from 6.41. [D15.]
 
Fleet Takes a Different Approach
Fleet Financial is taking a different route into stock trading and investment banking than other banks. Its $1.6 billion acquisition of Quick & Reilly Group shows it is betting that adding a discount brokerage firm with a national reach is cheaper and less risky. [D4.]
 
Tobacco Makers Object to New Plan
The nation's cigarette makers reacted bitterly to President Clinton's new tobacco policy, saying that it demands concessions that go far beyond a costly and groundbreaking plan they reluctantly agreed to in June. [A30.]
 
Georgia-Pacific Splits Company
Georgia-Pacific is putting its 5.8 million acres of timber into a new operating group and spinning it off to shareholders. [D7.]
 
Lucent Offers a New Strategy
Lucent Technologies announced its long-awaited data networking strategy, sending its shares up modestly. The company introduced telecommunications products and said that it intended to acquire at least one smaller company that could help it offer a full line of networking gear. [D2.]
 
S.E.C. Accuses Six of Fraud
The S.E.C. accused six people of defrauding a Swiss bank of $3 million and Lehman Brothers of $6.5 million. [D4.]

U S Airways and its pilots are far from reaching a cost-cutting agreement that the company says is a precondition for the airline's future growth. [D8.]
 
Turbulence for European Currency
The move to forge European unity with one currency, the euro, is meeting both approval and skepticism. Skeptics worry that the architects of the euro are inviting disaster by imposing a single economic policy on diverse countries. But supporters say the surrender of national sovereignty is the only way to challenge the economic power of the United States. [A1.]
 
Yamaichi Workers Arrested
Japanese authorities arrested five current and former employees of Yamaichi Securities and banned the firm from underwriting Government bonds as they investigated accusations that the brokerage house made illegal payoffs to a corporate racketeer. [D15.]
 
Bad Times for Business Economists
The annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics was a sedate affair because the attendees have a pretty sleepy job. [D3.]

I spent last week following Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her Middle East tour. Here is what was being talked about outside the corridors of diplomacy.
Tel Aviv -- "Explain one thing to me," I ask one of Israel's top financial officials. "Why doesn't the breakdown of the peace process devastate Israel's economy?" (Growth in 1997 will be about 2.5 percent; in 1996 it was 4.4.) The answer is that Israel today has two economies: the old economy of oranges, tourism and textiles, and the new information economy of software and high-tech exports. "The information economy is highly resistant to violence," he explains. "Almost all the exports go outside the Middle East, and most of these information technologies are small and light, or exported by modem. All the key inputs come from brains and human capital; no embargo can stop them. Smart global investors understand that. Bombing affects the old economy, not the new one. But this new economy was stoked by Israelis who came back from Silicon Valley after the Oslo peace. These knowledge people are highly mobile. The only economic threat is if the conflict makes daily life so unpleasant, the best brains leave. It could happen." 
 Damascus, Syria -- "So what's the talk of Damascus?" I ask a Syrian reporter, as Ms. Albright's caravan pulls into town.
"There is a big debate in the Government over whether to let the Internet into Syria," he says. The state intelligence services, which refuse to allow any Syrian to have a cell phone, are said to be arguing over who will get to be the Internet provider. Syria, though, has just allowed AT&T credit-card calls from the press room at the Sheraton. Good news: Syria is slowly updating its economy. Bad news: It's just entered the 1980's.
Alexandria, Egypt -- While Ms. Albright is meeting with President Hosni Mubarak, a Mubarak spokesman strides over to me. I am sure he wants to talk politics. The first words out of his mouth are: "Have you seen our Web site? We've had seven million hits in only 10 months. It's got news, a press digest. You have to see it." Three years ago there was no Internet provider in Egypt. Today there are seven. For the first time ever, an Egyptian diplomat boasts to me that the Egyptian stock market was the hottest in the world last year. He jokingly offers me the services of his stockbroker son. Suddenly there is more to talk about than just Arabs and Jews. As Egypt gets more open, the demands for more transparency at home begin to mount. The As-Sha'ab newspaper just ran a series alleging gross corruption by the powerful Minister of Interior and his sons, and so far the Government is letting the investigative journalism go on.
Abha, Saudi Arabia -- "So what are people talking about here?" I ask an official while Ms. Albright is meeting with gulf foreign ministers.
"Venezuela," the official says, without hesitating.
"Huh? Venezuela?" I ask.
"The Saudis think Venezuela is cheating on its OPEC quotas, and this year, for the first time, Venezuela surpassed Saudi Arabia as the biggest oil exporter to the U.S. The Saudis don't like that. They want America dependent on their oil, not on Venezuela's. It's a national-security thing for them."
Jerusalem -- Think about this: Israel's Yediot newspaper just went to Moscow and bought Russian spy satellite photographs of new Scud missile bases in Syria. Then Yediot hired a private U.S. expert on satellite photos to analyze the pictures. Then last week Yediot published the package as a scoop, without ever quoting a government official. Good news: In today's global market you can buy anything. Bad news: Syria is still preparing for another war.
Amman, Jordan -- Lead story in The Jordan Times on the day after Ms. Albright visits: a speech by the Crown Prince on Jordan's need for global competitiveness. The hottest new Web site in Jordan is http:// www.arab.net/gid/welcome.html. This is the home page of the Jordanian intelligence service -- the first in the Middle East to have its own Web site. An official handout says: "The site offers an interesting glimpse of the history, doctrine, responsibilities and viewpoints of the General Intelligence Department." Hottest new restaurant in Amman: "Books @ Cafe," an Internet cafe where you can sip coffee and surf the Web on a computer. In the morning Jordanian housewives come in to shop on the net; in the evening it's the students who gather to schmooze. Try the banana cream pie. It's made by the wife of an Israeli diplomat in Jordan. When Islamist opponents of Israel found that out, they posted it on the local Jordanian Internet, and called for a boycott until the pie was ousted. But the boycott fizzled, the cafe is packed, and the pie is still a favorite.
Jerusalem -- Ms. Albright is gone. I return here to get a look at the Jewish settlers trying to lay claim to the Ras al-Amud Arab neighborhood in order to really kill the peace. I use my fancy new Israeli-made Tadiran telephone to ask the religious philosopher Moshe Halbertal for his analysis. He takes me down into the volcano still lurking just below the thin layer of globalization in this region: "At the end of the Second Temple days," he says, "the great Jewish historian Josephus describes the unfolding of the Jewish revolt against the Romans that led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. A determined group of Jewish zealots, mobilized by a megalomanic sense of their role in history, pushed the Jewish people at the time into a struggle they did not want to participate in. Ultimately it destroyed them."

HEADLINE: Messinger Appears Victor in New Count

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
By a margin of just 658 votes, Ruth W. Messinger appears to have broken the 40 percent barrier needed to avoid a runoff with the Rev. Al Sharpton for the Democratic mayoral nomination, the Board of Elections announced early this morning.
Mr. Sharpton immediately said he would file suit today in state and Federal courts, seeking an injunction to force the board to proceed with the runoff, which had been scheduled for next Tuesday. 
 According to the nearly complete count, released at 12:15 this morning, Ms. Messinger had 40.16 percent of the 411,811 votes that had been tallied. Ms. Messinger had 165,383 votes, or 658 more than the 40 percent threshold, compared with 131,888 for Mr. Sharpton. A third candidate, Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn, received 86,619 votes.
"As of now, there will be no runoff," said Daniel DeFrancesco, the executive director of the board.
Providing there are no more problems with this tentative count -- the 10-member Board of Elections will gather in Manhattan this afternoon to certify it -- the results should finally bring Ms. Messinger a successful if sputtering end to her bid to become her party's nominee against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
There were no victory celebrations at Ms. Messinger's headquarters last night upon learning that, contrary to what the board said only after hours the polls closed last Tuesday, she had achieved the 40 percent of the primary vote needed to secure the nomination. Ms. Messinger's aides said that, given the tumult of the past week, she would not discuss the result until the board made a final decision.
But her press secretary, Leland T. Jones, embraced the decision and presented Ms. Messinger as her party's nominee.
"Ruth very much looks forward to the general election campaign against Mr. Giuliani," Mr. Jones said. "His record is replete with failures: the sorry state of the city schools, widespread unemployment, police brutality, unabated homelessness, poverty and hunger and, of course, Mr. Giuliani's repeated violations of the city's campaign finance law."
Mr. Jones was referring to contributions that exceeded city limits, and that the Republican Mayor was forced to return by the city's Campaign Finance Board
Mr. Sharpton displayed no anger toward Ms. Messinger over the result. "I'm not blaming Ms. Messinger on this problem," he told a roaring crowd of supporters in Queens last night, his eyes brimming with tears. "Ms. Messinger didn't count the votes. If she did, she would have won the first night. So, don't blame her."
And Mr. Sharpton signaled that he would use the result to raise his political stature in the city, invoking the rhetoric of Jesse L. Jackson: "I raised hope in this city. I raised promise in this city. I made people who had given up try all over again. I will not sell out the dream of the people."
Mr. Sharpton, eager not to be seen as acting to undermine Ms. Messinger if she does become her party's nominee against Mr. Giuliani, said in an interview that his suit would be aimed not at Ms. Messinger but at a Board of Elections that he argued was so inept that it had effectively disenfranchised his supporters, who were seeking to help him become New York's second black mayor.
Ms. Messinger's tiny margin provides her a shaky platform from which to begin her fall campaign against Mr. Giuliani, several Democrats said. It also places her in a tricky political situation with Mr. Sharpton and his supporters, whom she will need at her side.
Several Democrats said a critical decision for Ms. Messinger now is whether she decides to join, or at least endorse, Mr. Sharpton's legal challenges to the Board of Elections and the election result.
Ms. Messinger's aides said no decision had been made. During the last few days, they have rejected the suggestion of other Democrats -- most recently, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- that she pre-emptively join Mr. Sharpton in calling for the runoff to proceed, no matter what the outcome of the count.
Mr. Sharpton demurred when asked whether he expected, or wanted, Ms. Messinger at his side when he and his lawyers go to court this morning to file his suits. "How she responds, that's up to her conscience," Mr. Sharpton said. "She's not the target."
Significantly, though, one of Ms. Messinger's black supporters, United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem, said that he supported Mr. Sharpton's action. Mr. Rangel said he understood how the back and forth of the past week could encourage suspicions among Mr. Sharpton's supporters.
"Sharpton supporters have every reason not to have confidence in the electoral system as managed by we professional politicians," Mr. Rangel said in a telephone interview from Washington. "I think good people and reporters and everybody would say you want a good count. It's not going to be a suit against her. It's not going to be alleging fraud."
Referring to what he described as widespread inefficiencies at the Board of Elections, as well as the apparent close margin of the race, Mr. Rangel said it seemed essential that the board be forced to do the count again. "He's entitled to a decent count," the Congressman said.
The Elections Board, usually an undisturbed outpost for political appointees, finally finished the count early this morning after lumbering through another day in the spotlight during one of the more embarrassing episodes in its history. Elections workers were dispatched from across the city to Brooklyn, which was the last place where votes were left to be counted. At one point, three dozen workers were seen plowing through piles of envelopes, containing absentee ballots mailed in before the primary as well as affidavit ballots filed in polling places where machines were broken.
"We're whipping people to death here," said Mr. DeFrancesco, the board's executive director.
Even then, things did not go well for the agency. At one point in the evening, the number of votes left to be counted actually increased from earlier in the day. Board officials attributed that to a faulty estimate of how many ballots were left.
The scene at the board's headquarters on Adams Street in Brooklyn looked like a set from a 1940's movie. The election clerks, seated at folding tables, went through a long and convoluted procedure, first checking each sealed envelope against the spiral-bound master list of voters, then stamping the box under each person's name to indicate that a paper ballot had been filed.
From there, the ballots were handed over to a second set of clerks, whose job was to open the ballots and transpose the vote, by hand, onto a tally sheet. From there, the tally sheets finally found their way into the 1990's, as a clerk entered the results into a computer.
The Board of Elections is made up of 10 members named by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the five counties. Each is paid $125 per day of work -- such as today, when they will certify the results -- up to $12,500 a year.
The selection of workers for the board is unusual, according to the Federal Election Commission, in that merit is one factor that is generally not considered. Instead, the selection is purely a result of political patronage, something no one even attempts to hide. "My mom was a district leader so I got this job," said Daisy Rivera, 40, a registration clerk from the Bronx who spent her day opening envelopes.
As the counting continued, Ms. Messinger sought to hold Mr. Giuliani responsible for the board and its problems. She repeatedly described it as a mayoral agency under his command, even though it is not, and said Mr. Giuliani should have ordered the Board of Elections to stay open until it finished the count.
"Let me tell you, if he funds it, he runs it," she said. "It's under his control, it's his dollars."
"I don't believe he cares when the Board of Elections finishes this count," Ms. Messinger said, speaking on the radio program of David N. Dinkins, the former Mayor. "But the people of this city do."
Mr. Giuliani mocked Ms. Messinger for what he said was an inaccurate description of the board. "Ruth Messinger has been in city government for 20 years," he said. "There isn't a person that knows city government that doesn't know the fact that it is not a mayoral agency." The Republican Mayor said her comment "reveals the irresponsibility of her and her campaign."
"To suggest that it is a mayoral agency," he said, "when I am sure she knows that it isn't. Maybe she forgot in the excess of wanting to blame things on other people."
For Mr. Sharpton, it seemed appropriate that his final stand should come in Brooklyn.
And as it seemed clear that Ms. Messinger was getting her 40 percent, Mr. Sharpton left no doubt about his unhappiness. Speaking at a rally at the New Greater Bethel Ministries in Cambria Heights, Mr. Sharpton noted that the city's Campaign Finance Board had awarded Ms. Messinger $320,400 for her runoff campaign, pointing to the incongruity of one arm of the city financing an election while another nullified it.
"You have people on one side of the city handing out checks and you have people on the other side saying, 'We haven't counted yet!' " Mr. Sharpton roared to appreciative howls from his audience. "There's something wrong."

Chart: "Counting the Votes: Why It Takes So Long"
The results of last week's primary were still being counted as of last night. By law, the city can take up to 25 days to determine the final count. Here's how the votes were counted.
 
ELECTION NIGHT: UNOFFICIAL COUNT
 
MACHINE VOTES COUNTED
At each poll site, an election worker and two inspectors (one Democrat, one Republican) write down the vote count from each machine.
 
MACHINE VOTES AND PAPER BALLOTS GIVEN TO POLICE
A police officer from the local precinct retrieves the results, which are called to Police Headquarters in Manhattan.
 
POLICE ENTER MACHINE VOTES
At Police Headquarters, the numbers are typed into a computer system and then sent to The Associated Press.
 
OFFICIAL COUNT
 
MACHINES RETURNED
Usually within four days, the 6,824 voting machines are returned to borough warehouses and organized by Assembly district.
 
MACHINE VOTES RECOUNTED
Within two to four days, a Board of Elections team (one Democrat, one Republican) is assigned to each Assembly district. They recheck the totals from
each machine for the official count.
 
VALIDATING PAPER BALLOTS
Affidavit ballots are verified to make sure the voter is properly enrolled and registered. Absentee ballots postmarked the day before the election, and delivered up to and including the seventh day after the election, are checked to make sure the voter didn't vote by machine.
 
PAPER BALLOTS COUNTED
Once the 7-day period has passed, the verified paper ballots are counted and certified.
 
ALL RESULTS TOTALED
The machine and paper ballot results are totaled and certified by the Commissioners of Election as the official election results.

Clinton Says He Won't Sign Treaty Banning Land Mines
Applause broke out in Oslo as about 100 governments, including the United States, agreed to submit for formal ratification a treaty to ban land mines. But a few hours later, President Clinton said the United States would not sign it in December. A1 

Mr. Clinton, who called for a ban on anti-personnel land mines in front of the United Nations in 1994, bowed to military leaders who argued that such a ban would put American soldiers at risk. A8
 
Latin America Celebrates Trade
South American leaders at the World Economic Forum in Sao Paulo celebrated the rapid growth of trade involving their countries conducted under the auspices of Mercosur, a regional group led by Brazil. But amid elation over recent agreements with Andean Pact countries and the European Union, pointed jibes were made about President Clinton, who pledged at a summit meeting in 1994 in Miami to create a "Free Trade Area of the Americas."

Protestant Joins Belfast Talks
David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, the largest Protestant political party in Northern Ireland, agreed to join formal peace talks on the province's future. Other Protestant political leaders are expected to follow. Mr. Trimble said foremost on his agenda would be trying to have Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, expelled from the talks. A11
 
Swiss Get Holocaust Fund List
A list of 12,000 names of aging Jews in eastern Europe was handed over to the Swiss Ambassador in Washington, according to Swiss officials. The list represented a first step toward insuring that money from a fund set up by the Swiss Government, industry and banks actually gets to the Holocaust survivors it was set up to help. Payments of around $1,000 a person are expected for the survivors, whose average age is almost 80 and many of whom subsist on meager pensions. A13
 
12 Die in U.N. Helicopter Crash
A United Nations helicopter crashed in central Bosnia, killing all 12 passengers, including Gerd Wagner, a German diplomat who was deputy to the civilian administrator of the Dayton accords, United Nations officials said. The passengers were all officials trying to help Bosnia conduct elections. Four other Germans, five Americans, a Briton and a Pole also died, while the four Ukrainian crew members survived. A15
 
Israeli Right Faces Fissure
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked that three recently installed Jewish families move out of a house in an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem while allowing a group of Jewish students to remain there. The compromise offer was refused, however, by the wealthy American owner of the house, who asked the Israeli Supreme Court for a restraining order against any forced evictions. A3

H.I.V. Research Criticized
One of the nation's most prestigious medical journals has thrown a harsh spotlight on research the United States has been conducting on H.I.V.-infected pregnant women in Africa, Thailand and the Dominican Republic. An editorial in the journal likens the research -- in which some women are given placebos -- to the notorious Tuskegee experiment, in which poor black men suffering from syphilis were left untreated.

Christian Coalition Politics
A 40-minute tape of Pat Robertson, chairman of the Christian Coalition, addressing about 100 members of statewide branches offered a rare glimpse into the coalition's political objectives. It also cast new doubts on the insistence by the coalition, the nation's largest and most influential organization of religious conservatives, that it does not engage in political activities. A24
 
Clinton Outlines Tobacco Policy
President Clinton demanded tough penalties on cigarette makers if smoking by teen-agers did not decline dramatically over the next decade. He also said he would not accept any dilution in Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate nicotine as a dangerous drug. The nation's cigarette makers reacted bitterly, saying that Mr. Clinton's demands go far beyond a costly and ground-breaking plan they reluctantly agreed to in June. A30
 
Magnetic Field Found on Mars
In its first major discovery, the American spacecraft that went into an orbit of Mars last Thursday has solved one of the planet's longstanding mysteries: Mars does have a magnetic field.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Building Lures 20 Bidders With Romance and Profit Potential

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
An unprecedented number of investors, real estate moguls and foreign companies have joined the bidding for the Chrysler Building, the landmark Art Deco skyscraper on Lexington Avenue at 42d Street that serves as a monument to the industrial age.
Sales of office buildings in a hot real estate market have often drawn a half-dozen prospective buyers. But according to real estate executives and some of the bidders themselves, as many as 20 groups submitted offers on the Chrysler Building on Monday: they include Jerry Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, Steve Witkoff, Steven Roth of Vornado Realty Trust, Argent Ventures, Willow Funding, Paul Reichman, the Canadian developer whose empire collapsed in the early 1990's, Bernard Goldberg of Gotham Hospitality, and a handful of foreign investors. They see the Chrysler Building as a trophy worth having. 
 "It's funny to see these hard-headed businessmen responding to the romance of the Chrysler Building," said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of Insignia/ Edward S. Gordon Company, a real estate broker. "It's the romance of industry. Instead of gargoyles, it has hubcaps."
The romance surrounding the 77-story skyscraper, which is expected to sell for more than $200 million, has captured some imaginations as much as its potential for profit. Still, any buyer will have to invest an additional $100 million to restore the 67-year-old building to its original grandeur and to update its air conditioning and electric systems, people familiar with the deal said. Built in 1930, the Chrysler Building is clad in stone and stainless steel, with shiny ornaments that evoke images from the automobile industry.
The fate of the building has been uncertain since spring, when its owner, Jack Kent Cooke, died. A consortium of nine Japanese lenders led by Fuji Bank, which holds a $250 million mortgage on the property, then began a foreclosure action. The two sides have a tentative agreement to sell the property to the winning bidder.
"The building has generated strong interest from people all around the world for reasons that are not purely economic," said Warren Heller of Jones Lang, Wooton, which is conducting the sale for Fuji. "This seems to be a building people are extremely anxious to own and are prepared to go to unconventional lengths to make that happen."
The sale includes the nearby Kent Building and several other structures.
Mr. Heller refused to discuss any details of the sale, but real estate executives said the bids range from $150 million to about $200 million. Any buyer would also have to come to terms with the owner of the land beneath the building, Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Real estate brokers say that no one would complete a deal for the property without an extension of the land lease at a reasonable rent.
The Chrysler Building was built by Walter Chrysler, the auto maker, in the midst of a three-way race to be the tallest building in the world. The Chrysler Building surpassed 40 Wall Street after a spire was installed atop the tower, but it lost the top spot a few months later to the Empire State Building.
One of the Chrysler Building's most striking features is its Art Deco lobby, which combines African marble and chrome steel. A Chrysler showroom once occupied the first two stories. Some prospective buyers have speculated that the skyscraper's larger, lower floors could be used for office tenants, while the smaller, tower floors could be converted to hotel rooms or boutique space for law and architectural firms. Mr. Goldberg of Gotham Hospitality has proposed converting the entire building to what he calls the Hotel Chrysler.
Any prospect would be expensive.
At least one potential buyer who reviewed the building's prospectus decided that the price was too high.
"The effort involved did not justify what we thought we could get out of it," said Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties, a real estate investment trust, and publisher of The Daily News. "It's a humongous undertaking."
A prominent New York real estate developer who is bidding on the property, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Chrysler Building could be a profitable venture, despite the tens of millions of dollars it could cost in renovations. He discounted talk that the romance of the building had blinded buyers to the economics of the deal.
"It's a beautiful-looking building, but nobody is going to spend the pile of money needed here because they've fallen in love with it," he said. "It's got to be completely retrofitted. But it's in a great location. We think the bones are good and we can do something with it."

HEADLINE: Field for Interim CUNY Chief Is Narrowed to Four

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
A committee of trustees of the City University of New York has narrowed its search for an interim chancellor to four candidates and will interview them tomorrow, according to several people familiar with the search process.
The candidates include two former college presidents, Edmond L. Volpe, the longtime president of City University's College of Staten Island, and Alice Chandler, the president of the State University of New York at New Paltz for about 15 years and a former acting president at City College. 
 The short list also includes two CUNY professors, Ira Bloom, a professor of political science at Lehman College and a former vice chancellor, and Steven M. Cahn, a professor of philosophy and former provost at the university's graduate center.
The committee, which reviewed 17 names at a meeting on Monday, bypassed several CUNY presidents, including Allen L. Sessoms of Queens College, Kurt R. Schmeller of Queensborough Community College and Gerald W. Lynch of John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
The search committee, headed by Ronald J. Marino and working with CUNY's chairwoman, Anne A. Paolucci, agreed to try to forward two or three names to the full board by next week, along with their recommendation. Dr. Paolucci has said she hopes the trustees can appoint an interim chancellor at their Sept. 29 meeting.
The chancellor's post became vacant this week after the departure of W. Ann Reynolds, who accepted the presidency of the University of Alabama at Birmingham after growing disagreements with the university's trustees.
Several trustees have said that they want the interim chancellor to be more than a place-holder and to upgrade standards and help decentralize the university while they conduct a national search for a permanent chancellor. They have also said they want someone who is familiar with CUNY but who will not be a candidate for the permanent position. The interim chancellor is expected to serve at least a year, until a permanent chancellor is chosen and arrives on campus.
Herman Badillo, vice chairman of the board, who is not a member of the selection committee, said yesterday that he could not comment on the candidates, but that he thought they should be asked their positions on issues like remedial education, grade inflation and testing.
He called the interim chancellor's job "a suicide mission" and said the person has to be tough and be willing to "clean the stables."

Where a Celebrity's Name Isn't Worth a Dime

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

 BODY:
IN the mirrored entryway illuminated only by distant tall towers twinkling through the drawing-room windows, velvety-black shadows darted from side to side as real estate agents searched for a light switch. It was a scene that revealed Marlene Dietrich's empty apartment at its most glamorous. As every star knows, when one grows older, the lights must get dimmer.
In daylight, the apartment is not as romantic. With its scuffed parquet floors and dated appliances, traces of burnt-down cigarettes and the slightly bizarre use of smoky mirrors, it becomes a house in need of TLC, a two-bedroom handyman's special for sale in a prewar Park Avenue building. 
 When it first came on the market in July -- it was used only occasionally by relatives since her death five years ago -- Marlene Dietrich's 12th-floor apartment was priced at a cool and simple million dollars. Yet, only a week later, the price was dropped -- with a jolt -- to $625,000. This week, brokers for Sotheby's International Realty jubilantly confirmed that an offer for the full $625,000 had been accepted.
But experts say the selling price is probably just what it would have been if the apartment had been owned by . . . anybody at all. In fact, a two-bedroom apartment in the same Park Avenue building, on the much-lowlier and less valuable second floor, but in mint condition, sold in the nadir of the real estate recession for $645,000. And the potential buyer of the Dietrich apartment, an unmarried executive in her late 50's, told her agent that the apartment's history had piqued her interest but, in the end, did not influence her decision.
So how much does a celebrity name really add to the price of a property?
Not much, the country's top brokers say.
"Someone buying a house wants to see themselves living in the house -- not anybody else, even if that somebody else is somebody famous," said Alan Jacobson, a partner in Wimbish-Riteway Realtors in Miami Beach, who this month put Sylvester Stallone's house overlooking Biscayne Bay on the market for $27.5 million. (The larger-than-life statues of Rocky and Rambo in the garden are not included in the price but "may be negotiable," the realtor said.)
Madonna's apartment, too, is on the market -- and has been there since the beginning of the year. A 6,000-square-foot duplex at 41 Central Park West, in the prewar dowager known as Harperley Hall, the apartment comes with its own beauty parlor on the second floor, next to the steam room. Nevertheless, the price has just been dropped, from $6.75 million to $6.25 million.
"I've yet to see a house that belonged to a celebrity sell for more because of it," said Nick Coates, a partner in Coates, Reid & Waldron in Aspen, Colo. "Martina Navratilova's got a house for sale; it's been on the market for two years."
Cher's house in Aspen, an adobe bungalow with a lot of charm, sold about a year ago, for $3.1 million, Mr. Coates said. "And we didn't get a nickel more because of it," he added. "Of course, they all let it be known who owned the house -- I don't think it hurts the value -- but it doesn't make a darned bit of difference."
Frank Symons, who heads Sotheby International Realty's office in Beverly Hills, Calif., agrees. In Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Holmby Hills, the areas where he does the most business, sales are "driven only by price -- there's no added value to celebrity," he said, adding that Barbra Streisand's house on Summitridge Drive in Beverly Hills took five years to sell.
Edward Lee Cave, whose New York City real estate business caters to the wealthy, including celebrities, said: "Provenance is much more important for art and jewelry than it is for houses. An apartment that a celebrity lived in is different from a painting owned by a celebrity or a famous collector."
Both Mr. Cave and Alan Rogers, the managing director of Douglas Elliman, pointed to the sale of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue in early 1995, as "the exception that proves the rule." Although the $9.5 million sale of the huge, terraced, 14th-floor apartment was generally interpreted to be wildly above market, the two men agreed that the price was only about 20 percent more than the market then -- and might be a fair price for the same apartment in today's much hotter market.
"If a beaten-up chintz sofa goes for 100 times its real value, or a Kenneth Jay Lane necklace for 50 times retail, then Mrs. Onassis' apartment traded at an astoundingly fair price," Mr. Rogers said, referring to the record-setting $34.5 million auction of Mrs. Onassis' belongings, a media event in which a $500 set of fake pearls went for $211,500. "Do you want to buy Paul Newman's apartment? It's for sale -- and it doesn't cost any more than anyone else's."
Madonna's broker, Roger Erickson, a senior vice president of William B. May Real Estate, adamantly refused to discuss her apartment, at her request. But he did comment on the phenomenon of celebrity sellers.
"There's so much emotion in real estate," he said, "and the celebrity element can add an extra kick to the emotional impact of a new listing and draw even more people than it might otherwise do. Right at the beginning, you want to get as much action as you can -- and maybe you'll even get a higher price.
"But if the place doesn't sell right away, for whatever reason, any celebrity benefit starts to wear off."
Besides Madonna's apartment, Mr. Erickson is also handling John McEnroe's penthouse at 200 East End Avenue, a remarkable apartment with spectacular views of the East River and a chrome-trimmed pool table in the living room. The penthouse has been on the market, with several different brokers, for at least a year and a half and has an asking price of $1.18 million.
To make a difference in the price, an owner "would have to be a legend, like Jackie Kennedy or Princess Diana or maybe Elvis," said Dolly Lenz, a broker at Sotheby's who is a bit of a legend herself -- mainly for selling 24 multimillion-dollar condominiums in a day on one of her frequent trips to Hong Kong. "To make a difference, you'd have to be a legend. Or an icon. Or a god."
Ms. Lenz said the imprimatur of a run-of-the-mill celebrity doesn't make a difference, and cited as an example Andrew Lloyd Webber's $7.9 million apartment in Trump Tower, which has been on the market for years. "Robert Redford's penthouse is on the market at 955 Fifth," she added. "It's a very sweet little two bedroom, asking $3.95 million, and nobody's snapping it up because it's his. Don King's house isn't selling. Meryl Streep sold her place at 271 Central Park West, where Robin Williams lives, for a normal amount. Then there was O. J. Simpson's at 200 East 65th. That, they kept a secret. The people who eventually bought it didn't even know whose it was."
Then, of course, there is always the one true exception.
"Take Barbara Hutton's place in the Casbah in Tangier," said John Prince, the vice president of international operations at Sotheby's realty. The fact that it had been owned by the heiress was "really the only thing going for it," he said.
"Sotheby's owns the Cecil Beaton archive and used a glamorous picture of Barbara Hutton sitting in the house on the cover of the brochure," he said. "And it worked. It did the trick."
Even if celebrity cachet doesn't increase a price, a ghastly occurrence can drag it right down. "If someone was killed in a place, like where Henry VIII chopped one of his wives' heads off, that would not be good," Mr. Prince said.
Donald Trump agreed. "Leona Helmsley's place in Greenwich had a history of about eight people living there, all of whom went to jail or committed suicide or went bankrupt," he said. "When I heard she bought it, I said I wouldn't take it for $10,000 -- and look what happened." Ms. Helmsley went to jail.
In any case, if you're looking for celebrities, it might be wiser to move in next door to one.
"People like to be where a celebrity is, rather than where a celebrity was," Mr. Prince said.
Mr. Jacobson in Miami Beach said, "If you can live next door to Stallone or Madonna, perhaps you might pay more, because if these people live there, you might figure it's a good investment."
Like all the other real estate agents interviewed, Mr. Jacobson said he manages to weed out the sightseers. Still, he said he has shown the $27.5 million Stallone house about 20 times in the three weeks it has been on the market.
When the potential buyer is unknown, he asks for letters of credit from a bank or other forms of financial identification. But in some cases, the person seeking to check out the celebrity's house might be a bigger celebrity than the one selling it.
"If it's a Hollywood star, it's not someone we're going to ask for references," he said. "If it's the president or the prime minister of a country, the same thing."
"It's actually amazing how many people there are who can afford this property, for whom $27 million is just a drop in the bucket," Mr. Jacobson said, adding, "These are not the type of people to be awed by celebrity."

Auction Houses Courting Youth
Just as museums are trying to appeal to younger audiences, so too are major auction houses. In years past, officials at Sotheby's and Christie's said, they had not generated enough business from the young, contemporary collector who bought brash, avant-garde art. Now these auction houses are addressing the problem, each in its own way.
Christie's is rethinking its approach to selling and marketing contemporary art. Starting next year, it will segregate art made between 1970 and the present into a department separate from the one that handles modern masters like Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning and Robert Rauschenberg. The new department will hold sales of art made only within the last 30 years. 
 Sotheby's, by contrast, has actually bought a piece of the art world that caters to this younger market. Last week, it announced it had purchased 50 percent of Deitch Projects, the SoHo gallery started by Jeffrey Deitch that represents artists like the 80's star Jeff Koons and the Japanese photographer and performing artist Mariko Mori.
As part of the deal, Mr. Deitch will manage the new 20th-Century Art Gallery Program for Sotheby's. Essentially, he will oversee the Andre Emmerich Gallery, which Sotheby's bought last year and which will focus on 20th-century masters. (Mr. Emmerich will be a senior adviser.)
Mr. Deitch will also continue to run two spaces in SoHo: Deitch Projects, at 76 Grand Street, and another gallery, opening Nov. 1, at 18 Wooster Street, between Grand and Canal Streets. Deitch Projects will show primarily the work of emerging artists, and the Wooster Street space will exhibit more established contemporary artists.
For Mr. Deitch, the deal offers financial muscle. It also plugs him into Sotheby's worldwide network of contacts. "This gives me a structure to play on a much bigger stage," Mr. Deitch said. "I have a wide circle of active collectors who I am personally involved with, so I will be able to help with major consignments and private sales. My first priority, however, will be building the galleries."
Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive worldwide, said the deal would give the company more expertise in 20th-century art. "The field is so large, it's overwhelming," Mrs. Brooks said. "We're better served by having someone from the dealer world who can provide us with his own vision." Although neither Mr. Deitch nor Mrs. Brooks would disclose the financial details of the arrangement, sources close to the deal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sotheby's investment was in the neighborhood of $1 million.
 
'The Warhol Look'
Bloomberg News, the financial data company, is becoming a new patron of fine art in New York. In June, it helped pay for the Public Art Fund's installation of several sculptures by Keith Haring on Park Avenue and at the Doris C. Freedman Plaza, at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street. Now it is sponsoring "The Warhol Look/Glamour Style Fashion," opening at the Whitney Museum of American Art on Nov. 8, during New York's fashion week, and running through Jan. 18.
"It was Warhol who said business was going to be the art of the 80's," said David A. Ross, the Whitney's director. "We know Bloomberg is interested in pop culture, so we approached them." The show, organized by Mark Francis and Margery King, curators at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, traces the artist's work from the 40's through the 80's. The Whitney announcement came right after the Metropolitan Museum of Art said that Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and chairman of Bloomberg Financial Markets/Bloomberg News, had joined its board. "Our television and radio stations cover a lot of cultural events," Mr. Bloomberg said. "We get the same kind of upscale audience that goes to museums."
At the Whitney's annual benefit party, which coincides with the Warhol show, Bloomberg will supply video screens and monitors for the museum's Madison Avenue facade and its interior. They will show reels of vintage Warhol film, as well as live coverage of the party.
 
Doors Close in Chelsea
It was inevitable. Despite the explosion of new galleries in Chelsea, one had to be the first to close. That doesn't make the "For Rent" sign a welcome sight in the window of 521 West 21st Street, where the five-month-old Paolo Baldacci gallery closed last week. A show by the abstract painter Alan Uglow had been scheduled to open yesterday. "I was shocked," Mr. Uglow said. "I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the work, since some of it was made specifically for the space."
Mr. Baldacci said he couldn't afford the gallery. "I have a gallery in Milan, and I couldn't be in two places at once," he said. "Despite all the good work, the economic results were not up to my expectations." Before moving to Chelsea, Mr. Baldacci had a gallery for five years in the Fuller Building, at 41 East 57th Street, where he showed Italian modern classics and some contemporary American artists.
Rent there was too high, "and there weren't enough American collectors interested in Italian art," he said. "In the last two years, I shifted more toward young, contemporary artists, but it became impossible to do while running two galleries."
 
Weekend Art Walk
The second annual Chelsea Art walk is this weekend, when 40 galleries and 35 artists' studios will be open to the public. There will also be guided tours given by Winston Wachter Fine Art, the Upper East Side gallery that helped organize the festival. The event is sponsored by Tag Heuer, the watch manufacturer, which commissioned Herb Ritts to photograph Olympic athletes; these works are on view at D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22d Street, where there is also an information desk with schedules, maps and brochures.

Bonds Slip As Traders Take Profits

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The four-day rally in Treasury securities ended yesterday as investors took profits.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond lost 2/32 , to a price of 99 24/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, remained unchanged at 6.39 percent. Since last week the price of the long bond has increased 2 27/32 , with bondholders gaining nearly $28.44 for every $1,000 invested in bonds. 
 Investors focused on the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's September survey of regional business conditions, which suggested that the manufacturing sector may be slowing. The report bolstered bonds and overcame a report of a trade deficit that was sharply wider and a weekly jobless claims number that was surprisingly lower.
The regional Fed's report gave market participants little reason to think that the central bank would raise short-term interest rates when its Federal Open Market Committee meets on Sept. 30.
"I'm afraid we're going to see more days like today for the next couple of weeks, where there is high volatility, but little movement," said Christopher A. Low, a senior economist with the HSBC Group in New York. "We probably won't have any significant data until the employment report early next month."
Reviewing yesterday's economic data, Mr. Low said that "the weekly unemployment claims was the first report on tap and was consistent with strong employment growth; the report was quickly followed by a bigger-than-expected trade deficit, which did not signal bonds should trade up or down, but did whipsaw the market."
The market rose after the Philadelphia Fed survey seemed to confirm the market consensus about a slowing in manufacturing. Traders took particular note of two of the survey's components. The employment index fell to a reading of -3.0 in September from a gain of 14.2 in August, and the prices-paid index reading slipped to 15.1 from 16.1. Over all, the Philadelphia Fed index dipped to 20.4 in September, from 24.3 last month, a steeper drop than what economists had expected.
In the weekly jobless claims report, claims fell by 5,000, to 306,000 for the week that ended Saturday, the lowest level in a month and a half, according to the Labor Department.
Bonds were also under pressure from the Commerce Department's July trade deficit report, which showed the deficit widening to a larger-than-expected $10.3 billion from a revised $9.54 billion in June.
Robert Kapito, a senior portfolio manager at Blackrock Financial Management and Compass Capital mutual funds who oversees more than $50 billion in bonds, said that after years in the shadow of a soaring stock market, bonds are back. He cited the inflow of $6.5 billion into bond funds in August, the most in three years.
Mr. Kapito said several factors make Government bonds attractive now. Yields are attractive compared with those of bonds from other countries, especially from the large capital markets of Germany and Japan, where the yields of 10-year securities yesterday were 2.16 percent and 5.50 percent, respectively, compared with a Treasury issue with the same maturity yielding 6.10 percent.
"This is keeping U.S. bond investors at home and attracting foreign money into U.S. bonds," he said.
Mr. Kapito also cited the strength of the dollar, as well as a shortage of bonds relative to demand. With the United States reducing its deficit spending, fewer bonds are being issued. He forecast yields on Treasuries dropping to a range of 6 percent to 6.25 percent on the long bond by the end of the year.
In when-issued trading for next week's Treasury auctions, the new two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.79 percent, and the five-year at a price to yield 6 percent.

HEADLINE: At Whirlpool, 4,700 Workers To Lose Jobs

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The Whirlpool Corporation announced today that it would dismiss 4,700 employees -- just more than 10 percent of its work force -- and take a $350 million charge against earnings as part of a plan to improve profits.
The reorganization plan will affect mainly its European operations, where Whirlpool has run into strong local competition, made marketing missteps and, more recently, faced adverse exchange rates in Italy, its European manufacturing hub. The company said it also planned to seek strategic alliances or other alternatives that will get it out of money-losing joint ventures that make refrigerators and air- conditioners in China. 
 "We're addressing the realities of the marketplaces in which we operate," said David R. Whitwam, chairman and chief executive of the appliance giant, which is based in Benton Harbor, Mich.
Mr. Whitwam stressed that the revamping did not represent a retreat from the company's global expansion, which began in 1989. Indeed, in addition to the retrenching, Whirlpool also said that it would assume control of Brasmotor S.A., the profitable Brazilian appliance company that has been its longtime partner in South America, by paying $217 million to increase its stake to 66 percent from 33 percent.
To cover the cost of that investment and reduce its financial risks, Whirlpool will sell $1.6 billion in receivables and other assets and operations of the Whirlpool Financial Corporation, its finance subsidiary, mostly to the Transamerica Corporation. Whirlpool projects that the deal will bring in $300 million after it pays off associated debts. Whirlpool had announced in July that it was considering its options for its finance arm.
The moves to cut losses in China and Europe were long overdue from Wall Street's perspective. Investors sent Whirlpool's shares soaring 14.2 percent, up $8.0625, to a 52-week high of $64.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"They really cracked the whip," said Nicholas Heymann, a consumer products analyst at Prudential Securities, which raised its recommendation on the stock to a buy.
Whirlpool's moves came just months after Electrolux, its largest European rival, announced a reorganization that will cut up to 12,000 jobs and close 25 plants.
Whirlpool's write-off will come to $3.38 a share and will be taken in the current quarter. The sale of Whirlpool's finance operations, expected in the fourth quarter, should add 53 cents a share to earnings.
The result would be a slim net profit for the year. Without such special charges, analysts expected earnings for the year to be $3.18, according to Zacks Investment Research. Whirlpool earned $111 million, or $1.48 a share, on sales of $4.2 billion in the first half of the year.
Whirlpool said that the job cuts would take place over three years and that the annual savings from the reorganization would reach $180 million in 2000. Roughly half of the job reductions are expected to be in Europe. As many as 800 jobs could be eliminated in the United States, not counting employees of Whirlpool Finance.
"It's our goal to grow our commercial finance business, and this is a big expansion for us, especially of our base in Europe," said William McClave, a spokesman for Transamerica, which is based in San Francisco. The deal with Whirlpool calls for Transamerica to continue providing a range of financial services over 10 years.
Whirlpool's global drive had once been viewed as a well-executed plan to expand out of its market-leading but stagnant North American appliance base. An interview with Mr. Whitwam published in the Harvard Business Review in 1994 was titled "The Right Way to Go Global," and the company's stock rose to $74 early that year. Mr. Whitwam said that Whirlpool was prospering because it was not just operating overseas but making sure that new technology, manufacturing skills and other assets were shared among countries.
But problems were already growing, both at home, where second-ranked General Electric was stepping up its efforts, and in Europe, where Whirlpool had been slow to consolidate manufacturing plants it had acquired and where demand was too sluggish to raise prices. Meanwhile, Whirlpool's rapid buildup in Asia was draining cash.
Whirlpool's stock tumbled below $50 in 1994 and hovered at that level for three years as setbacks undermined each hint of recovery. The company took a $240 million write-off at the end of 1994 in a reorganization aimed at eliminating 3,200 jobs, including 1,200 in North America.
Whirlpool was not the only appliance maker struggling with attempts to extend its geographical reach. Maytag, which invested heavily in Europe, finally gave up in 1995, swallowing a $135 million loss on the sale of its operations there.
Mr. Whitwam said that the restructuring announced today reflected Whirlpool's conclusion that high unemployment rates and low levels of consumer confidence pointed to poor market conditions in Europe for a long time to come.
In China, Mr. Whitwam said, Whirlpool decided to stop making refrigerators and air-conditioners because there was severe overcapacity and other manufacturers planned even more production.
"There won't be equilibrium for years," Mr. Whitwam said, but Whirlpool intends to continue making washing machines, where it has the leading market share, and microwave ovens, where it has the third most popular brand.
"We'll sell 2.2 million appliances in Asia this year, up from 40,000 four years ago," Mr. Whitwam said. "We'll sell more next year and will be doing it profitably."

HEADLINE: China Turns Another Corner

 BODY:
The centerpiece of this week's Chinese Communist Party Congress was President Jiang Zemin's call for the sale, merger or closing of the vast majority of China's state-owned enterprises. His declaration exceeded expectations and signals the boldest economic transformation attempted by Beijing since the early 1980's.
Regrettably, Mr. Jiang and his party colleagues showed no parallel interest in political liberalization, the key to consolidating a market economy and relieving chronic tensions between China and the United States. 
 Mr. Jiang emerges from the conference with his personal authority strengthened and his chief party rival, Qiao Shi, nudged into premature retirement. Next month he will try to enhance his diplomatic prestige with a long-sought state visit to Washington. The chances of a successful meeting would be improved by a good-will gesture like an amnesty for political prisoners, including the democracy advocates Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan.
Even after two decades of market liberalization under Deng Xiaoping, China's 305,000 state companies still account for more than half of urban employment, though a far smaller share of total output. Overstaffed, inefficient and obliged to provide a full range of welfare benefits to their employees, these enterprises had threatened to exert an increasing drag on China's future growth potential. They now absorb 90 percent of business credits provided by the state banking system, and the special privileges enjoyed by their managers also made these companies seedbeds of official corruption.
Despite artful language casting the move to shareholding and market relations as appropriate to "the primary stage of socialism," Mr. Jiang's initiative sharply challenges the party's guardians of Marxist ideology, something he had been conspicuously unwilling to do during the long and delicate transition of power occasioned by the frailty and death of Mr. Deng.
That Mr. Jiang now seems to feel confident enough to embrace accelerated economic reform leaves room for hope that he will go further and reopen the issue of political reform, off-limits since the 1989 blood bath in Tiananmen Square. In a modestly encouraging sign, China's officially controlled press permitted a slightly broadened range of political debate in the weeks leading up to this week's Communist Party Congress. Chinese leaders traditionally use these congresses, held every five years, to unveil major shifts in ideology, leadership or economic structure.
Mr. Jiang's privatization plan calls for the vast majority of state-owned firms to pass into the market, leaving only about 500 of the very largest in government hands. Many of the details, including the timetable, have yet to be filled in. What is most important is that government monopolies not give way to private monopolies and that privatization not become a smoke screen for handing over public assets cheaply to the well connected.
Shutting down these state enterprises carries social and political risks. That partly explains why it has been put off so long. There is likely to be a jump in unemployment and considerable suffering as workers lose their present entitlements to company-provided schools, health care, pensions and other social benefits. Worker protests are already on the rise in China and could grow, all the more so since Chinese citizens still have no real political outlet for their grievances.
Beijing can partially mitigate these problems by moving quickly to build a universal government-guaranteed safety net to replace benefits now provided mainly to employees of state enterprises through their workplaces. But it is unlikely to achieve lasting stability until it recognizes the virtues of decentralizing political as well as economic power and unleashing the civic as well as the productive energies of its people.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall For a Third Week

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly in the latest week, the Government said today, providing more evidence of a persistent tightness in the labor market.
 The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment compensation slid by 5,000, to a seasonally adjusted 306,000 last week, the lowest since the week of Aug. 2. It was the third consecutive week to show a drop.
 
 Wall Street economists had expected a surge in first-time claims to 320,000.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Construction of Rentals Is Surging

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Capitalizing on the steady demand for new rentals in Manhattan, developers will start leasing 227 apartments next month in a building rising at 33d Street and First Avenue, once the site of a gas station.
Called Eastbridge Landing, the 22-story building, at 577 First Avenue, will have studio to three-bedroom apartments, as well as a few larger units and penthouses. It will also have 10,000 square feet of medical office space on the ground floor along with an 80-space parking garage. 
 Ten more rental projects with some 2,500 new apartments are expected to be completed in the city by early 1999, according to estimates from Feathered Nest, a residential brokerage firm in Manhattan that is the leasing agent for Eastbridge Landing.
The vacancy rate for apartments in luxury buildings in good locations throughout Manhattan is under 1 percent, most brokers agree. That, along with rising rents, which increased about 10 percent on the East and West Sides the first half of this year, is fueling the construction activity.
"There will be adjustments in the rents according to the supply and demand," said Corinne R. Pulitzer, senior vice president at the Charles H. Greenthal Residential Sales Corporation, a residential brokerage. "But with the current lack of supply for luxury rentals, and assuming the economy remains healthy, new projects should rent quickly."
Ms. Pulitzer said the demand is coming from young professionals and families, as well as people selling their condominiums and co-ops to take advantage of the strong sales market. Those people are aware that "if they sell high they will have to buy high" and are opting to rent, she added.
At the same time, given the scarcity of development sites and the greater availability of financing, "construction has and is going forward on parcels that are ready to go, and in areas that until recently would not have been considered by the lending community for upscale housing," said Andrew J. Singer, chairman of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, a real estate financing firm in Manhattan. "That in turn," he said, "is expanding the definition of prime neighborhoods."
The developers of Eastbridge Landing bought the old gas station site last year from Mobil Oil in a sale that drew many bidders.
Construction is to be completed by March, said Trevor Davis, president of Davis & Partners, which is building Eastbridge Landing in a joint venture with Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, who own the RFP Holding Corporation. Both companies are based in Manhattan. The partners declined to give the purchase price, but the total cost is $45 million; financing is coming from American and European banks.
"It is a great location with easy access to midtown in a well-established predominantly residential neighborhood," Mr. Davis said, noting that the project would be the first rental built in the area in years and that none are planned within a six- to seven-block radius of the site. In terms of new luxury rentals on the East Side, "the playing field is not crowded," he added.
The partners have also renovated four adjacent four-story brownstones with 30 rental apartments and 6,000 square feet of street-level retail space. At that project, known as Eastbridge Landing Annex, the 11 unoccupied one-bedroom apartments have been leased, as have the storefronts.
Eastbridge Landing is in Kips Bay, the area between 30th and 34th Streets and First and Third Avenues. Ms. Pulitzer said that while the area, near New York University Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital, "may not have the same cachet as the Upper East or West Side, it is a solid family neighborhood."
The studio to three-bedroom apartments at the building, designed by the Manhattan architect Costas Kondylis, will have 525 to 2,500 square feet of space. Early estimates of monthly rents range from $1,750 for a studio to $7,800 for the top three-bedroom. Rents for the larger units and penthouses, with 2,500 to 3,500 square feet, may start at $7,000.
Mr. Davis said tenants will also have the option of combining apartments.
Mr. Davis said Eastbridge Landing, which offers views of the East River, will have the same focus on "quality and service" that proved successful at 300 East 64th Street, which he and his partners completed last year and where all 103 units were rented out in 16 weeks.
Amenities at the new building, faced in brick with stone and concrete details, include a health club and an outdoor landscaped garden. Tenants will have to pay for a parking space in the garage, but those prices have not been set, Mr. Davis said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Widened to $10.3 Billion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Driven in part by a mounting deficit with Japan, the nation's trade gap widened sharply in July, to $10.34 billion, the biggest since January, from $8.29 billion in June, the Commerce Department reported today.
Lower exports and higher imports both contributed to the surprisingly big rise, which economists attributed to statistical problems as well as the strong dollar, the weak economies of many trading partners and unflagging American growth. 
 The $5.2 billion deficit with Japan -- the biggest in two years -- captured political attention here and in Hong Kong where officials are gathering for this weekend's meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
"Slow growth and the fact that the Japanese market is still too closed to imports are reasons why our trade imbalance with Japan is large," complained William Daley, the Commerce Secretary. He called the persistently large gap between the two countries "upsetting" and said it would be "unacceptable" for Japan to try to export its way back to prosperity.
The latest widening of the deficit provides ammunition to those opposed to the Clinton Administration's attempt to win so-called fast-track authority for the President to negotiate unamendable trade agreements. Critics of fast-track power generally equate deficits more with lost jobs than with the benefits of lower-cost goods.
After dipping in June, imports rebounded 1.1 percent in July, to a record $87.7 billion, led by a 6.4 percent advance in vehicles, parts and engines, reflecting, in part, an end to production delays at auto assembly plants in Canada. But motor vehicles imported from Japan jumped 10.5 percent to bring the seven-month total to $20.9 billion, nearly nine times the value of vehicles the United States has sent to Japan this year.
Figures for trade between individual countries are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation.
Exports, meanwhile, retreated 1.4 percent from June's record peak to total $77.38 billion, with industrial supplies and materials -- especially shipments of nonmonetary gold -- the largest factor.
While trade data often swing sharply from month to month, analysts said they took little comfort that July's widening deficit might have been exaggerated by seasonal or statistical factors.
"There's hardly anything you can say that's good about trade prospects," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities.
He said that the Japanese "just don't have any more levers to pull" that would raise their demand for American goods or reduce the reliance of their companies on overseas markets. He said he was not, however, convinced that Japan's economy was as bad as was indicated by this week's report that showed a contraction at an 11.2 percent annual rate during the spring quarter. His doubts were widely shared by senior American policy makers.
The Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said today in Seattle that the United States was seeking "a better understanding of what's happening economically in Japan."
Janet L. Yellen, the President's chief economic adviser, said in a speech in New Orleans on Monday that what was important was not the size of nation's trade gap -- the amount by which imports exceed exports -- but the volume of trade, which implied "openness" to its benefits.
She also said that "there is a big difference between borrowing in order to invest -- as the economy is doing now -- and borrowing in order to consume, as we did in the 1980's."
Analysts acknowledged today that the country is indeed investing substantially but noted that the Government's report still showed net imports of consumer goods in July.
As American officials resumed their grumbling about the deficit with Japan and China, which have been repeatedly switching places as the biggest and second-biggest surpluses with the United States, a business-backed research group outlined a new strategy for disputes with Asian countries.
"Back away from unilateral sanctions and bilateral trade battles," advised the Committee for Economic Development. "Instead settle disputes where possible through the World Trade Organization, which is proving fair and effective."
The deficit with China, the department's report showed, climbed to $4.7 billion from $4.3 billion, while Japan's $5.2 billion deficit was up from $4.1 billion in June.
As for Western Europe, the deficit soared so much -- to $4.3 billion from $800 million -- that analysts, noting similar leaps in July 1996 and 1995, suspected flaws in the statistics. "Something is rotten in Denmark -- not to mention Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom -- with respect to these trade flows," said Joseph Liro, economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York.

HEADLINE: The Cries of Welfare States Under the Knife

SERIES: CHANGING MONEY: Second of two articles

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BENEVENTO, Italy

 BODY:
At the end of a dim corridor full of yellowing files spilling their forgotten contents onto dusty shelves sits Dr. Mario Maddaloni, the Italian state's inquisitor in this depressed southern town.
His mission is to cut the waste in Italian welfare, saving the state money by rooting out phony invalids. The disabled of Benevento account for an astonishing 21 percent of the population. The culture of dependency is deep-rooted. But if Italy is to balance its budget and qualify for the euro, that culture has to change. 
 Dr. Maddaloni has already interviewed about 800 local invalids. Of these, more than half were found to be making false claims and lost their benefits. It was wrenching work, the doctor said, because many of the people coming to the office needed the disability pensions to get by.
"But we have to do this," he said. "As long as we waste public money, we will pay more taxes. And Italy will get left behind -- a car with a beautiful wheels, a nice paint job and a lousy engine."
Throughout Europe, the euro, like globalization, has proved unforgiving of the inefficiences of what Germans call the Vaterstaat -- the consoling Father-State, always there when needed. It is forcing a radical reconsideration of the model of European society -- one that is treacherous politically because it has been decreed by central bankers rather than demanded by voters.
The euro requires countries to cut their budget deficits to 3 percent of total output this year if they are to qualify for the new European money on Jan. 1, 1999. That can only be achieved through cutbacks in the Continent's welfare state. Italy's budget deficit stood at 12 percent as recently as 1992. The euro is shaking Europe like a massive electric shock.
Even in countries whose public finances were less messy than Italy's, the euro is posing a basic question: how much of the welfare state should be sacrificed for it? If European nations give radically different answers, tensions will jolt the single-currency zone.
In Germany and France -- with respective unemployment rates at a record 11.6 percent and 12.6 percent -- the debate on how to shift from the expensive subsidizing of inactivity to stimulating jobs is already politically explosive. If welfare reform is pushed too hard, there could be social upheaval, as there was in France in December 1995, when strikers virtually shut down Paris to protest proposed changes to social security.
The debate is particularly volatile because it is envenomed by a sense that Europe's social model is under assault from a more vigorous United States.
As Jacques Chirac, the French President, made clear by declining to don cowboy boots at the meeting of leading industrialized nations in Denver in July, he does not want to be an extra in Bill Clinton's global theme park. "We have our model," Mr. Chirac said, "and we plan to stick to it."
But is that model compatible with the euro? France has advanced social protection but also record unemployment, high taxes, labor-market rigidity, low growth and a rapidly aging population. It, and countries like it, will almost certainly find the small budget deficit demanded by the euro's fiscal discipline hard to sustain. It is also likely to need different monetary policies from states that have chosen to sacrifice some social security for jobs and faster growth.
"If countries give radically different answers to the challenge of reforming the welfare state," said Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German Bundesbank, "we are going to have problems in the euro zone."
In Britain, for example, social security spending accounts for about 13 percent of total output, compared with 20 percent in Italy and 23 percent in France. Britain seems set on a radically different course from its Continental neighbors. It is a course that borrows much from the American conviction that reduced taxation, deregulation, labor-market flexibility and a dwindling safety net are the route to success in the jungle of the global economy.
"People look across the Channel and they do not like what they see," said Kenneth Clarke, former Chancellor of the Exchequer. "Confronted with the euro, they ask, why should we be locked into failure? Continental Europe is overregulated and sclerotic, and the key to recovery there is structural change."
British growth was double the French rate last year and, at about 3 percent, will be well above French rates again this year. Unemployment has plunged to 5.8 percent, from 10.4 percent in 1993, as the economy has benefited from lower taxes and the birth of a shareholding culture.
In the Netherlands, consensus has achieved what the Thatcherite revolution did in Britain, bringing unemployment down to 6.5 percent from more than 10 percent a decade ago, without accentuating inequalities as much as in Britain. Growth, as in Britain, has surged. But in both countries, to varying degrees, job security and welfare protection have been sacrificed.
Europe thus offers various economic models, whose differences will be laid bare by the euro. The currency will test the sustainability of different systems even as it exposes them.
A common currency will reveal, for example, that the same brand of Scotch whisky can vary in price by 50 percent, depending on whether it is bought in Spain or Germany. It will also reveal the relative attractiveness of different European economic environments in terms of tax levels, costs of labor, onerousness of welfare, and incentives to business.
"If we get the euro," said Bruce Kasman, a vice president of J.P. Morgan in London, "inefficient policies will be much less sustainable. You are going to see the same kinds of competition as between states in America. There are going to be huge pressures on countries to provide policies conducive to investment."

Italy Fights Its History
A System Corrupted By Cold War Politics
In Italy that pressure is particularly intense. More than 10 percent of Italians -- six million people -- are officially disabled. They will cost Italy more than $33 billion this year in disability pensions.
Many do have physical handicaps. But many are the healthy beneficiaries of a bygone system. Before the cold war ended, $33 billion was considered a reasonable annual investment in Italian political stability.
For decades Italy produced "invalids" at a remarkable clip. The politician, usually Christian Democrat, who arranged for the payment of a disability pension won votes. Particularly in southern Italy, where jobs were scarce, to be disabled was to gain a passport to money or a job.
It was a costly setup. Budget deficits and national debt spiraled. But the system helped keep the Christian Democrats in office and the Communists out. Italy did not go the way of neighboring Yugoslavia or Albania. Social security meant geopolitical security.
Now, however, a political age has given way to an economic one. Over Germany's border with Poland it is no longer the Warsaw Pact that threatens; it is workers making one-tenth of German salaries. Yesterday's esteemed political client in Italy is today's resented financial burden. It is the euro, not the politburo, that obsesses Europe.
"The euro is my frontier," said Enrico Michele, Undersecretary of State for the center-left Government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi. "Either we make it or this Government falls. And to get there, we have to negotiate reform of a distorted pension system. The welfare state is part of the European idea and cannot be completely dismantled. It must, however, be changed."
Michelangelo Bergamini is leading the campaign for change. As a senior Treasury official, he has been asked to lead a sweeping inquiry to unearth the fraudulent recipients of disability pensions.
Such is the labyrinth of Italy's state-run pension system -- costing more than $190 billion a year, or about 15 percent of total national output -- that there are three separate categories of invalid, each paid by a different state entity.
Mr. Bergamini was asked to start by investigating the 1.4 million cases handled by the Ministry of the Interior. The number of people receiving these pensions has doubled since 1985; pensions cost the Interior Ministry about $8.8 billion in 1996. Over an 18-month period that is to end on March 31, 1998, Mr. Bergamini's inquisitors, operating throughout the country, are interviewing 150,000 of the 1.4 million "invalids" to examine whether their claims are real.
"We are well into the program," Mr. Bergamini said, "and up to now we have found that one in four of those inspected was a false invalid. We have found blind people who were not blind and people miraculously cured of rheumatoid arthritis. In the most extreme cases -- say a blind man working as a bus driver -- we are bringing criminal cases."
Mr. Bergamini's agent in Benevento is Dr. Maddaloni. He works in a crumbling palace. There are typewriters but no computers. Just outside town, there are still people living in the mobile housing they were given after the 1980 Naples earthquake.
The bureaucracy of Italian welfare had assumed fantastic proportions before the current attempt at reform began. Under a 1980 law, for example, a person with a peptic ulcer causing "grave digestive disturbance" could claim a disability level of 51 percent to 60 percent. Diabetes of "medium gravity" would confer 31 percent to 40 percent disability. Different ailments could be added -- like roulette chips piled one on the next -- to increase one's degree of disability.
The degree was critical. Until 1992, a 35 percent disability level was enough to qualify a person for one of the numerous jobs in the public administration and state companies reserved for invalids. In the south, the postal service was a preferred haven.
A politician would send somebody to a friendly doctor who would certify a disability. And the reward would be a flood of votes. "Whoever governed from 1960 to 1990 had to have clients," Dr. Maddaloni said. "Welfare was the means."
The level of disability needed to qualify for a monthly pension is now 74 percent. The pension is quite small -- about $250 a month -- but a very useful cushion for poor families in places like Benevento.
At 100 percent disability, the situation changes. Authorities may approve a further $450 a month, supposedly to pay for a full-time nurse. There is no verification of the employment of such a nurse. Remarkably, more than 60 percent of the 1.4 million people now under investigation by Mr. Bergamini enjoy this additional benefit.
 
Italy Eyes the Prize
So Much to Change, So Little Time
Mariano de Luca, president of a Benevento invalids' association, is furious about Mr. Bergamini's campaign. He pointed to the man sprawled on the sofa and urged him to speak. "Say something, Pasquale, say something!" he hollered. No response. "Something, Pasquale, you must say something!"
From Pasquale di Fiori there emerged a groan. The sound slipped from lips contorted into a grimace. His hands writhed with the effort; his body was clearly a vessel he did not control. The sound, a crescendo, was a call from a distant place.
Satisfied, Mr. de Luca turned away. "You see what the Government is doing," he said. "Pasquale can't walk. He can't talk. But the Government calls him a false invalid! So they won't give him the disability pension he deserves. The euro is being used to justify an Italian witch hunt."
Mr. di Fiori has twice requested the extra $450 payment for 100 percent disability and been refused. The authorities argue that his parents can look after him. But to Mr. de Luca, the case suggests that the excess of abuse has been replaced by an excess of reforming zeal.
But Mr. Bergamini remains tranquil in his mission, convinced that Italy should break with its former culture and become a truly modern state with the euro as its currency.
Already this year, his investigation has saved about $150 million, an amount expected to double by the end of the first phase of his inquiry next year. Moreover, the number of invalids -- which had been growing more than 10 percent a year in the 1980's -- stopped rising last year.
Eventually, it is clear, Italy's entire pension system will have to be reviewed. The three categories of invalid will have to be grouped into one and a rigorous inspection of claims carried out, officials said. Resistance from labor unions is certain to be intense.
All this bodes ill. It is the sheer extent of these needed reforms that causes Arrigo Sadun, an Italian economist, to think that Italy is misguided in its haste to adopt the euro at its planned outset on Jan. 1, 1999.
"There is no question the Germans are right," he said. "Government spending is not yet under control. We Italians are going through a one-shot, unsustainable adjustment. Italy is not ready for the euro."
Still, the strides Italy has made so far are staggering. Nowhere is it more obvious that the euro is fueling profound economic adjustment in Europe.
Inflation has come down to a projected 2 percent this year, from 5 percent two years ago, and is now below the German level. The critical budget deficit figure may be as low as 3.2 percent this year. The national debt -- more than 120 percent of total gross domestic product -- remains way above the 60 percent target set for the euro, but it is also coming down.
"The euro has been the means to modernize our country," said Giuseppe Zadra, president of the Association of Italian Banks. "Without that external constraint we would have been too lazy to do it ourselves. If we do not make it now, it would be a disaster."
But Hans Zehetmair, culture minister of the German state of Bavaria, is among those unimpressed by Italy's efforts. "When you see how creative the Italians are with bookkeeping," he said, "then I say no, we will not allow this to make the German people suffer. Italy cannot come into the first wave of the euro."
 
Britain Keeps Its Distance
An Ex-Basket Case, And Proud of It
While the euro has been the agent of change in Italy, Britain transformed itself several years ago and as a result has profound doubts about a common currency. Britain's economic culture is now so profoundly divergent from that of Continental Europe that it is not easy to imagine Britain operating with the same money as its European Union partners.
Britain is an important economy. More than 60 percent of its trade is with other European Union countries. The City of London has by far the Continent's largest securities and capital market. A euro without that market will obviously be incomplete, and a Britain without the euro may face exclusion from a powerful club.
Yet, to travel around Britain today is to be plunged into a world to which Germany and France seemingly have scant relation. The attractiveness of soccer-club shares or building-society shares is the stuff of casual pub conversations. Shareholding has become a kind of national sport.
This radical change struck Walter Hasselkus when he moved from Germany to Britain two years ago to take over management of Rover, which had been acquired by BMW.
Old images of conflict -- the miners' strike, auto strikes -- inevitably lingered in this German executive's mind from the days when Britain was Europe's basket case. But what he found, he said, was "an acceptance that competitiveness is an absolute must."
"It is amazing, absolutely amazing," Mr. Hasselkus continued, "to see the brutal change of ideological direction here. Britain is very, very far from the social-market model that has served Germany well, and I think we in Germany have to be very careful not to knit the social safety net closer than we can afford."
Olivier Cadic, a French businessman, recently moved part of his electronics business, Info Elec, from France to Britain precisely to escape charges and constraints that he could not afford.
In Britain, he can hire and dismiss easily, and social security taxes add only 10 percent to his wage bill, compared with 50 percent in France. "We can employ people here," Mr. Cadic said, "but in France it has become prohibitive to hire. The French system seems to be conceived so that unemployment can go up."
For Mr. Cadic, Britain has realized, as France has not, that the world has changed. For a long time, the devloped world enjoyed a virtual monopoly -- of knowledge, of capital, of the most important goods, of military strength. That domination has now been seriously eroded. The knowledge and means exist for things to be made anywhere. This is the challenge that globalization poses.
Eddie George, governor of the British Central Bank, thinks Britain can comfortably live alongside the euro zone for an indefinite period, preserving sterling as its currency, just as Canada preserves its currency alongside the United States. And he sees grave dangers in joining the euro before France and Germany have undergone reform.
"If some European areas are ready to lower minimum wages and achieve a flexible labor market, and others are not," he said, "how can the euro work?"
 
France Sits in Concrete
Anglo-Saxon Model As Gallic Bugbear
Yet in France, the very word "flexibility" -- also favored by Mr. Tietmeyer of the Bundesbank -- is taboo. It is seen as a code word for replacing Gallic solidarity with marauding American capitalism. France wants the euro, but unlike Italy it seems unprepared to change to accommodate it.
"An extreme free-market approach may work," said a senior official at the French Finance Ministry. "But it is not for us."
Ed Balls, an aide to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, worries about what he sees as an effort in Paris to caricature the Anglo-Saxon model as an excuse not to change. "Look," he said, "America has created 30 million jobs since 1979. Surely we can borrow something from this. I say to the French, 'Our model is not perfect but nor is yours. Let's try for dynamism without cruelty.' "
To look at a pay slip from Eric de Cardonnay's BDM decorating company in the Normandy town of Bray-et-Lu is to understand something of France's absence of dynamism. In its way, it is as alarming as the number of invalids in Benevento -- and as rich in ominous implications for the economy of the euro zone.
When Mr. de Cardonnay started his company in 1977, there were five lines to a salary slip. Now, after various taxes and charges have been listed, there are 29 lines stretching over two full pages.
At the end of this labyrinth, the cost to Mr. de Cardonnay of employing a worker at a gross monthly salary of 10,111 francs ($1,699) ends up at 15,306 francs ($2,572), or an additional 51 percent. The worker ends up with net pay of 7,882 francs ($1,324).
The charges to Mr. de Cardonnay amount to a grand tour of France's welfare state, one that cossets but also appears to stifle.
There are taxes for family allowances, for a fund offering low-cost housing loans, for unemployment insurance, for work accident compensation, for pensions, for the improvement of security on building sites, for professional training, and even for reducing the social security deficit -- an estimated $7.2 billion this year.
Indeed, the charges are so numerous and diverse that this entrepreneur has given up trying to remember what all the acronyms stand for. All he is sure of is this: "These charges are simply uncontrollable. They go up all the time."
That, in turn, creates difficulties. Having expanded steadily through the 1980's, BDM faced a crisis at the beginning of this decade caused by a combination of rising labor costs and falling revenue. Mr. Cardonnay decided he had to lay off six of his 21 workers.
For 18 months after the layoffs, he had to continue paying an amount equivalent to most of the six workers' salaries, so they could be retrained for other jobs. This so-called conversion training has in practice proved largely ineffectual.
"Anyone who has gone through that will never hire again," Mr. de Cardonnay said.
BDM's experience is anything but uncommon. Increasing costs and constraints on dismissals keep entrepreneurs from hiring and expanding. Unemployment rises.
With it, the pressure builds on the welfare state funded by the charges. Taxes must rise further to compensate. The pay slip must grow longer still. The circle is vicious.
"If costs for employers in America were the same as in France," said a leading French banker, "perhaps 25 percent of Americans would be unemployed."
The dangers to the euro in this French situation are clear enough. Unemployment brings anger, and it can take nationalist forms. Already the extreme-right National Front has become the third-largest party in France, with 15 percent of the vote. It constantly attacks the euro as a German plot to take over Europe.
If unemployment continues to rise and change continues to be resisted, the euro may simply prove a catalyst to disaster. It will be the symbol -- weak and untrusted -- of a stagnant Continent. The state budgets behind the money will be overstretched. Germans will want their mark back. The inquisition at Benevento will have been in vain.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Rubin to Press Central Banks to Disclose Financial Data

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Sept. 18

 BODY:
In the Clinton Administration's first major response to the Southeast Asian currency crisis, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said today that the United States would press governments and central banks around the world to disclose more financial data that most nations routinely keep secret.
The American initiative, which could meet considerable resistance from Asian nations whose currencies have been under attack, stems from the discovery that Thailand's central bank kept secret data that would have warned international investors of the country's impending crisis. 
 But several Asian leaders have disagreed and argued that the crisis was precipitated by currency speculators, many of them from the United States, and it is likely that they will oppose disclosure requirements that could embolden such speculators to make new assaults on the value of their currencies.
"Let me be absolutely clear," Mr. Rubin said in a speech this morning, on his way to Hong Kong for the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. "The United States has a profound interest in the restoration of financial stability in Asia."
The I.M.F. has tried to help restore order to the Asian financial markets in recent weeks, and is reviewing whether it missed signs over the last few years of Thailand's huge bank-debt exposure.
Today's announcement has echoes of Mr. Rubin's actions after the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-95. At the time, he pressed the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, and then much of the third world, to agree to tougher disclosure standards, an action he believed would have helped avert the Mexican crisis. If foreign investors had known the extent of Mexico's economic troubles, he argued at the time, they would have stopped pumping cash into the country -- and imposed fiscal discipline on Mexican political leaders.
Mr. Rubin conceded today, however, that the post-Mexico changes did not go far enough.
"Our concept was right," he said. "But as time goes on, you learn. There are many things we did not cover" in those rules, he said, "that we now should include."
Among them are statistics showing commitments to buy or sell currencies in the future, figures that the central banks of many nations consider state secrets.
Central banks periodically report the levels of their reserves of foreign currency, which helps investors assess whether the countries can sustain current exchange rates and protect against devaluations. But the disclosure rules do not require them to disclose whether they have committed themselves to use those reserves to buy or sell other currencies -- say the yen or the dollar -- in the future.
In short, the governments have to report their assets, but not their liabilities. It is a little like telling a credit card company that you have $1,000 in the bank to pay your monthly bill -- but neglecting to mention that you have already committed $900 to pay the mortgage.
Thailand kept that data secret for much of this year. When its currency came under attack, it discovered that its reserves were worth much less than the world thought. That precipitated a crisis that spread to Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
With the Thais, many leading speculators suspected that the country's central bank was essentially overstating its available reserves, and would be forced to drop the fixed exchange rate between its currency, the baht, and the dollar. But other investors, with less savvy or less sophisticated research, were left in the dark.
No country would be compelled to follow the new disclosure rules. But if Mr. Rubin succeeds in getting a number of countries to agree to fuller public disclosure through the International Monetary Fund, the pressure on others to follow suit would be great. Investors could reward countries that disclose more, and charge higher "risk premiums" to those that refuse to go along.
Mr. Rubin's proposal will also include forcing commercial banks to report details of their nonperforming loans. Japan's banks kept these figures secret for much of the first half of the 1990's, then suffered huge losses when the facts came out. The country is still trying to recover economically.
"Making these disclosures is often difficult in the short run, and the temptation is to avoid doing so," Mr. Rubin said. " But it builds credibility in a nation's financial system and avoids much more difficult problems in the long run. The reality of life is that things get out sooner or later."
Mr. Rubin has made clear in recent days that he is worried about a world backlash stemming from the Asian crisis, one that would reverse a decade of progress toward greater openness in financial markets. Both Thailand and Malaysia, for example, tried to clamp down on currency traders to prevent them from selling the local currency, and from selling stocks in their markets. Thailand's market has declined 37 percent (and nearly 55 percent when translated into dollars) so far this year.
While the United States directly aided Mexico in 1995 -- lending it $12 billion that has since been paid back -- its only aid to Thailand has been through the I.M.F. program to promote stability there. But the effect on the American economy may prove considerable since Thailand and its neighbors are greatly reducing their purchase of foreign-made goods. That is damaging to American companies. Developing nations in Asia accounted for more than a fifth of all United States exports last year.
As Mr. Rubin headed to Hong Kong and then to China, where he is to meet the new leadership team emerging from the Communist Party Congress ending in Beijing, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright described for the first time her vision of the role of international economic issues in American foreign policy.
She argued today that leadership in opening markets -- including giving President Clinton new fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements -- was critical in bolstering American influence.
"The best course for our nation is not to curse globalization, but to shape it, to make it work for America," she said. "It would be foolish to get up from the table and leave the game to others. For we are competing very, very well."

HEADLINE: United Cuts Travel Agency Commissions

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
United Airlines has cut travel agency commissions to 8 percent from 10 percent for all tickets sold in the United States, saying yesterday it did so to save $80 million to $100 million annually so that it could "survive and succeed" in the global marketplace.
Gerald Greenwald, United's chairman and chief executive, said the new fees reflected the airline's "larger objective of keeping all of our costs under control." 
 "The quest to cut costs isn't a one-shot exercise; it's a way of life at United," he said. "There is a new and more intense level of competitiveness that all airlines must now confront in the marketplace."
United, a subsidiary of the UAL Corporation, said the change would have no effect on ticket prices for passengers.
The 28,500-member American Society of Travel Agents promptly denounced the cuts, which take effect today, as "deplorable and shortsighted." It also said that it "is already exploring all options, legal and otherwise, and is determined to take the strongest and most prudent course of action available."
Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the association, said it had not had time to calculate the travel agents' potential losses in the event other airlines follow suit. None had by last evening, and telephone calls to several airlines' corporate offices seeking comment were not returned.
United's announcement follows the imposition on Feb. 9, 1995, of what has since become the standard 10 percent commission on domestic fares, with a $50 limit. That earlier cap was initiated by Delta Air Lines, also as a move to cut costs. The maximum commission on United's domestic flights will continue to be $25 for each one-way ticket and $50 for a round-trip ticket. The airline will have no maximum for international tickets bought in the United States.
The 8 percent rate, United noted, is identical to the rates of Delta and American Airlines on some routes. Most other airlines continue to pay 10 percent.
The Delta cap two years ago set off a furor among travel agents, who held meetings and protest rallies to denounce Delta and the other carriers that soon followed Delta's lead. The carriers that did not go along were Trans World Airlines, Southwest, America West, Midwest Express and Alaska Airlines.
Yesterday's reaction from travel agents was more subdued, perhaps because most agents had not yet learned about United's decision late in the day. Those who had were not pleased.
"First they cut service to the bone," said Joe Galloway, the owner of Trans-Continental Travel in Houston. "Now they're cutting commissions of the people who sell 80 percent of their seats and interface with their customers at least 80 percent of the time."
Despite dire predictions that the Delta caps would force thousands of travel agencies out of business, the number of agencies has increased to 33,727 as of June 30 this year, Mr. Loucks said, compared with 33,411 at the time the caps were imposed. Moreover, travel agency sales hit $100 billion last year for the first time, up 6 percent from 1995.
But some travel agents say the industry avoided calamity only because of a steadily improving economy that has led to record numbers of airline passengers.
In addition, some agents began charging fees to all but their most loyal clients, while others put greater emphasis on booking cruises, hotels, rental cars and tours. "What also blunted the effect of the caps," Mr. Galloway said, "was that the average price of tickets has gone up."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE INCUMBENT;
Mayor Removes the Gloves And Laces Into Messinger

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
Unleashing a formal assault on his newly named Democratic opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began the general election campaign yesterday by ridiculing Ruth W. Messinger for opposing his plan to regulate sex businesses in New York City, and vowing to highlight differences between them every day until the Nov. 4 election.
Having been assailed for weeks by the five candidates in the Democratic primary, Mr. Giuliani made it clear that he would no longer sit back and take the criticism now that Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, has been certified by the Board of Elections as his opponent in the general election. 
 In truth, Mr. Giuliani has never been sparing in his criticism of Ms. Messinger, but yesterday marked the beginning of the formal critique of her record that his aides said he has long been eager to inaugurate.
Addressing an invited group of supporters and midtown business leaders in what was billed as his first campaign speech, Mr. Giuliani used a series of sarcastic asides to repeatedly belittle Ms. Messinger for stating in 1995 that adult businesses can actually invigorate the quality of life of some neighborhoods in the city.
"You think it lends character to the city," he said, as if directly addressing Ms. Messinger in regard to sex shops. "There are people who think that, and they are entitled to think it. I think it destroys the character of the city, and there are people who are entitled to think that. And let's see who thinks that more, people on your side or people on my side. That's what an election is about, right?"
He also made a withering reference to her prediction that his adult zoning plan, which became law in October 1995, would never hold up under constitutional scrutiny. In July, a five-judge appeals panel approved the law, upholding an earlier lower-court decision. The law is now on appeal to the state's highest court.
"It was decided not by Ruth Messinger, but by a judge, which is the way we do it in America," Mr. Giuliani said, producing raucous laughter and applause from the audience of about 200 supporters in the New Victory Theater in Times Square.
In a letter to the City Planning Commission in July 1995, Ms. Messinger opposed the Mayor's plan to drastically limit the number of sex businesses in the city by stating, among other reasons, that such establishments have "invigorated" the quality of life in gay neighborhoods like the West Village.
"The proposed adult establishment zoning text could well result in the closing of most of the gay-adult-oriented businesses of Christopher Street, as well as those in other predominantly gay neighborhoods of the city," she wrote. "This could have profoundly detrimental consequences for the gay community, not to mention an important part of our city's economic and tourism-industry base."
Leland T. Jones, Ms. Messinger's spokesman, said she was trying in the letter to make the point that in some neighborhoods sex businesses fit in well while in others they cause problems, which he said argues against the Mayor's broad-brush approach.
Under Mr. Giuliani's law, such businesses may not operate within 500 feet of one another and must stay at least 500 feet from homes, schools and churches, which will eventually mean that only about 30 of the current 180 sex businesses will be allowed to remain.
In contrast, Ms. Messinger proposed limiting sex shops to one per block and restraining their signage, but not restricting them to certain parts of the city.
Mr. Giuliani's decision to begin his campaign on the issue of sex zoning reflects his conviction that the various aspects of his quality-of-life effort are so popular with the city's middle class, particularly outside Manhattan, that any opposition to it is by definition a liability to his critics. For instance, he contrasted the Times Square of several years ago, which he said was patronized only by "the sick and the perverted," with its current, more family-oriented character, which he said was the result of his zoning law. He strongly implied that Ms. Messinger had stood in the way of the new Times Square.
In fact, the cleanup of Times Square began several years before Mr. Giuliani entered office, and has proceeded independently of his zoning law. Ms. Messinger proposed regulating sex shops in a far less restrictive way -- a proposal that went nowhere -- and has supported the changes under way in Times Square. But the Mayor said the issue illustrated the vast differences in their respective worldviews.
"This may be the first, very stark difference of opinion on quality of life," Mr. Giuliani said, "but there'll be many, many differences of opinion on taxation, on what's needed for proper policing in New York City, on what's needed for economic development. You'll be hearing a lot about that, too."
He also warned that the general election campaign would be nothing like the Democratic primary, in which the opposing candidates generally refrained from attacking one another in their zeal to criticize Mr. Giuliani. Parodying the lack of rancor in Monday night's televised debate between Ms. Messinger and the Rev. Al Sharpton, he said that voters could expect a far more spirited exchange of views.
"Since I've been asked all the questions so far, I thought it might be useful to start asking the questions the other way," he said. "And to illustrate that the general election campaign will be very different than the primary. This will not be attacking people. It won't be trying to avoid issues. This is going to be, like, really issue oriented."

HEADLINE: On Long Island, Critics Upset About the High Cost of Police

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Sept. 18

 BODY:
For years Long Island's police officers have been among the nation's best compensated, with high salaries, short work schedules and generous fringe benefits.
The resulting costs have imposed an increasing burden on local taxpayers, and the issue is now provoking public debate. 
 Here in Nassau, the police budget accounts for 72 percent of the proposed property tax levy in County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta's budget for 1998. In neighboring Suffolk, 79 percent of the county property tax is designated for the police.
Beyond Long Island, county police costs are far less, because of lower pay and smaller police forces. In Westchester, for example, the police budget equals 4 percent of the county property tax levy. But Westchester has only 235 county police officers, compared with 5,800 in Nassau and Suffolk.
And police costs on Long Island will increase under the latest labor contracts. In late August, an arbitrator granted the Nassau police a compounded raise of 24 percent over five years, paralleling an earlier award to Suffolk police of 18.7 percent over four years. By contrast, another arbitrator gave much less to the lower-paid New York City police: 13.3 percent over five years.
Base pay for an experienced Nassau officer, which was nearly $60,000 under the old contract, will rise to $73,859 in the year 2000. But the total cost -- with overtime and benefits like shift differentials, clothing and equipment allowances, health insurance and pension contributions -- now approaches $100,000 per officer. Under the new contract, it will reach $120,000.
"You end up with an agency where virtually every sworn member gets an executive-level salary," said Michael J. Butler, a lawyer and a retired Nassau police captain who studies police compensation and management. "Cops and former cops are my friends, colleagues and clients," he said. "They provide quality service, but we're taxpayers, too, and the costs sound out of control."
Citing the latest contract award as exorbitant, critics are calling for an overhaul of the laws and procedures governing police arbitrations. The rising criticism is unusual, considering the political sensitivity to police issues in the suburbs, where crime rates are low and on the decline.
Concern about crime helped fuel the migration from the city to Long Island, where the police have long enjoyed wide support from the public and elected officials. Police unions exercise great political clout, through candidate endorsements, campaign contributions and lobbying for legislation.
The debate has taken on partisan overtones. County Executive Gulotta, a Republican running for re-election, has steadfastly declined to comment on the police contract. But his Democratic challenger, Lewis J. Yevoli, the Oyster Bay Supervisor, has accused him of giving in to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association for political gain.
"We have TV commercials and billboards saying 'Tom Gulotta is tough on crime' -- paid for by the P.B.A.," Mr. Yevoli said. "Who are we kidding here? They gave $100,000 to his last campaign. What will contributions buy you? Probably the most lucrative contract in the nation. No knock on the cops, but taxpayers simply cannot afford this."
Even a Republican, County Comptroller Fred Parola, said: "Obviously this was an excessive decision. Our police do a great job, but there is already some backlash on the part of taxpayers who see this as inordinate."
Like most Long Island police raises over the years, the latest awards exceed the rate of inflation, raises for other government workers and the wage norms in private industry. Besides high pay and benefits, police contracts on Long Island generally require less work than at other police agencies.
Although officers often work 12-hour shifts in Nassau, for example, the total time worked averages 1,552 hours per year. Converted to a conventional 5-day, 40-hour week, that is equivalent to working 39 weeks and being off 13. Private-sector employees typically work about 45 to 46 weeks, with the remainder off for vacation, holidays and sick time.
Officers are entitled to retire at half pay after 20 years on the job, receiving pensions that with normal life expectancy will exceed $1 million. Those with disabilities like a heart condition get three-fourths pay, tax free. In addition, officers receive termination checks for unused sick leave and other credits that now top $100,000 and under the new contract will hit $200,000.
"Those golden parachutes are real budget time bombs," Mr. Butler said.
Long Island's high compensation draws hundreds of applicants for every opening. In Nassau, 32,000 applied for the last examination, in 1994. In Suffolk, dozens of lawyers took the police test. The pay here also draws officers from New York City; about a third of Nassau's new officers are hired from there. Even ranking city officers are willing to transfer and start over as rookies.
But the Nassau P.B.A. president, Gary Dela Raba, defended the gains won by his members.
"You've got no scandals here, no corruption," he said. "We've drug-tested close to 1,400 cops and caught only one violator. We're professionals. This contract puts in the first college requirement in the country. We've made schedule changes to cut down overtime and sick time. Gulotta's getting the biggest bang for the dollar here."
Mr. Dela Raba also noted that Long Island is a high-income, high-cost area, with electricity and tax bills among the nation's highest.
Each contract gain becomes a target for unions at the smaller police forces on Long Island -- some of which outdo the county police. The law requires arbitrators to consider comparable pay.
"We're going to keep leapfrogging with each other till doomsday," the Suffolk County Legislature's presiding officer, Joseph Rizzo, said. He has urged the State Legislature to amend the arbitration law to limit raises to the rate of inflation.
Mr. Parola, too, favors revising the arbitration law. "Obviously the deck is stacked," he said. "The law has to be revisited" to give more consideration to things like inflation, ability to pay and the job market.
"The cops are great, and you can't blame them or their unions," said Thomas R. Suozzi, Mayor of Glen Cove and a Democrat. "But you can blame the legislators who won't change the law and the County Executive for not negotiating more aggressively."

HEADLINE: Ancient Indian Site Challenges Ideas on Early American Life

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Earthen mounds at an ancient American Indian site in Louisiana have been found to be the earliest known remnants of human construction in the New World. The discovery challenges traditional ideas about early American cultures and suggests that pre-agriculture, pre-ceramic hunting societies were more socially complex than previously thought.
The mounds, begun about 5,400 years ago, predate other similar public architecture at Indian sites by nearly 2,000 years, archeologists said in a report being published today in the journal Science. 
 The new findings could transform thinking about the progression of economic and social development in ancient societies, especially about the nature and abilities of bands of hunter-gatherers who once inhabited the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. They show that agriculture, permanent settlements or wealth from trade were not necessary conditions for the mobilization of labor for ambitious construction projects.
"It's a rare and wonderful case where one piece of research fundamentally changes our whole picture of early American life," said Dr. Vincas Steponaitis, an archeologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is president of the Society of American Archaeology and an authority on Indian mounds.
Dr. Bruce D. Smith, an archeologist and specialist in early American agriculture at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, also praised the research. "It's a surprising find, this early date," he said. "But it makes a lot of sense."
The investigation of the mounds at a site known as Watson Brake near present-day Monroe -- a city of about 55,000 people in northern Louisiana, 100 miles east of Shreveport -- was conducted by a team of archeologists and other scientists led by Dr. Joe W. Saunders, a professor of geosciences at Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe.
The existence of the mounds, whose purpose is not known, was first brought to the attention of archeologists in the 1970's by Reca Bamburg Jones, who lives on a nearby farm.
In their journal report the scientists described Watson Brake, in the flood plain of the Ouachita River, as the place where hunter-gatherers apparently returned each spring and summer to feast on the fish and mussels in the river, the turkey, deer and raccoon in the woods and the edible plants, many of which would later be among the first domesticated plants in eastern North America. The site was full of animal and fish bones and the seeds of goosefoot, marsh elder and other plants, the scientists said.
Even though the people did not settle permanently at the site, they left a permanent mark there: the mounds. The 11 mounds and connecting ridges form an oval-shaped earthen enclosure about 900 feet in diameter. The largest of the dome-shaped mounds is 25 feet high; the others are less than 15 feet high, and the connecting ridges are no more than 3 feet high.
Charcoal and decaying vegetation in the soil were analyzed in several different dating tests, at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Washington in Seattle. From these tests it was determined that the mounds were built from 5,400 to 5,000 years ago.
Previously, the earliest known mounds were those at Poverty Point, also in Louisiana, which were built 3,500 years ago. Among the best known and most impressive mounds were those erected in more recent times by Indians known as the Hopewell culture, from 100 B.C. to approximately A.D. 400 or 500, and the Mississippian culture, from A.D. 1000 to 1500. Thousands of these sites are scattered through much of the Eastern United States.
But nothing about the new findings explains the purpose of the mounds, one of the nagging mysteries in American archeology. Did they have religious significance or a ceremonial function?
No human burials have been uncovered at Watson Brake or many other sites. People may have lived on top of the lower mounds, but not the higher ones. Perhaps, Dr. Smith of the Smithsonian said, mounds were ways for a hunting people to define their territory or celebrate themselves.
In a separate article in Science, Dr. Saunders observed, "I know it sounds awfully Zen-like, but maybe the answer is that building them was the purpose."
Dr. Saunders said in a telephone interview that he was just as surprised as others that the Watson Brake mounds were "so large, so complex and so early," and added, "We generally had believed that mobile hunting and gathering people would not have the capability to plan and organize such construction."
For a long time, archeologists assumed that mound building was linked to agriculture, and most of the sites were, indeed, from periods after the Indians had begun to cultivate crops. The people at Poverty Point were not yet farmers, but showed signs of thriving from extensive trading networks.
Such thinking stemmed from the conventional view that societies emerged from the hunter-gatherer stage by settling in permanent villages and domesticating plants and animals. And, as they thus gained wealth and surplus food, they could afford to devote time and labor to monumental architecture. Also, with agriculture and a settled life presumably came more complex social and political structures, including the leadership skills and organization to undertake such engineering projects as mound building.
Or, as Dr. Steponaitis remarked: "Mounds are, in effect, fossilized labor. They are the remains that mean that some social mechanisms were in place in a hunter-gatherer society that made it possible to mobilize labor on a large scale."
Dr. Smith said the findings at Watson Brake seemed to support an emerging concept in which climate change that occurred in the eastern part of North America 7,000 to 5,000 years ago made the river valleys richer sources of food, which mobile hunter-gatherers returned to seasonally, and thus began a gradual transition to a more sedentary life.
Several archeologists said the existence of elaborate mounds at Poverty Point and Watson Brake showed that the early Indian cultures in what is now the United States were probably developing independently of societies in Mexico and Central America. Mound building appears to have been widespread in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys long before there is evidence of it in Mexico.

Owners Take No Action On a Realignment Vote

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The magic number is 7.
That's not a combination of victories and losses that would clinch a division championship for somebody. It's the number of teams baseball's planning strategists would ideally like to have change leagues in their quest to realign the major leagues for 1998. 
 The owners did not act on realignment on the final day of their quarterly meetings today. In fact, they postponed their self-imposed deadline to adopt a plan, pushing it back from Sept. 30 to Oct. 15.
John Harrington of Boston, chairman of the realignment committee, said his group still had a half-dozen plans under consideration but did not provide details to the owners. However, a member of the committee said that now that the radical plan of a 15-team switch is dead, seven was the target number.
He didn't cite teams, but the key to achieving that number appeared to be persuading the Houston Astros to move to the American League.
Drayton McLane Jr., the Astros' owner, has steadfastly stated throughout the realignment debate that while he would like to be in a division with the Texas Rangers he does not want to move. He reiterated that position after the meeting today.
"Houston has been in the National League since 1962," he said. "We have strong ties and sentiments in the National League. We feel that's an important part of our franchise. We're not a candidate."
But if the planners want the Astros to move, they will very likely offer a financial inducement. Compensation became a topic of conversation during the meetings, and Harrington said it was possible the San Francisco Giants could be compensated for any possible economic loss as a way of overcoming their objection to having the Oakland Athletics join them in the N.L.
Oakland, Anaheim and Seattle are prepared to switch to the National, and Kansas City and Milwaukee have indicated similar interest, the Royals to be in a division with St. Louis, the Brewers to be with the Chicago Cubs.
Montreal and Florida are the two N.L. teams that would accept a move to the A.L. Philadelphia previously expressed a willingness to join them, but today, the Phillies' chairman Bill Giles said the club plans to stay where it is. The Phillies didn't want to be the only original N.L. club to change leagues.
The move of the three A.L. West Coast teams would create two four-team divisions made up of all of the major leagues' eight western teams. Except for Peter Magowan of the Giants, who aired his objections during today's two-hour meeting, the owners like that part of the realignment plan.
The players association, on the other hand, doesn't want to strip the A.L. of a West division and could throw up a roadblock to realignment. The union has to approve any plan the owners adopt.
Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, stressed today that he and his aides have been in constant communication with union officials about their plans, but that doesn't mean that any plan they adopt will gain the union's approval.
If the Astros agreed to move -- any team asked to change leagues has veto rights -- the major leagues could look like this next season:
National League (16 teams):
East -- Mets, Braves, Phillies, Pirates.
Central -- Reds, Cubs, Cardinals, Royals (or Brewers).
West I -- Dodgers, Padres, Giants, Rockies.
West II -- Angels, Athletics, Mariners, Diamondbacks.
American League (14 teams):
East -- Yankees, Red Sox, Orioles, Blue Jays, Marlins.
Central -- Indians, Tigers, Devil Rays, Expos.
Midwest -- White Sox, Twins, Rangers, Astros, Brewers (or Royals).
This picture, however, is not as simple as it looks. If the Expos are going to move, they want to be with the Blue Jays, who want to remain with the Yankees, the Orioles and the Red Sox. But the Marlins are apparently conditioning their prospective moves on being with those same three teams. Furthermore, the Marlins and the Devil Rays don't seem to want to be in the same division.
Selig said the meeting was shorter today than he had anticipated. Asked why the owners didn't stay longer and debate the pros and cons of the various plans, he said: "That's an impediment to the process. We know where each club is, what they want, what they don't want. We're trying to be accommodating. There's no perfect plan, but we have a better understanding of how maybe we can get to the end of the line and solve the problem."
Driving the desire for realignment, he explained, was the schedule, which, he said, has grown more unwieldy each season.
"This schedule is inflexible," he said. "A schedule that terrorizes individual clubs and their fans is not very helpful to anybody."
 
Public Ownership Now Possible
 The owners approved public ownership of teams, meaning clubs may sell stock in a minority percentage of their ownership. No rush to the stock market is expected, however. To go public, a team would have to issue a prospectus and annual reports with financial disclosure that clubs have always been reluctant to provide.

HEADLINE: Fitness, Not Medicine, Increases Life Expectancy;
Income Affects Health

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Sept. 12 news article reports that Americans' life expectancy is increasing. Should we be elated? It all depends on what the yardstick is. Do we give the Olympic gold medal to the first-place finisher, or to the one who did better than last year? 
 While life expectancy in the United States has indeed increased, it has done so for the entire century. Japan, however, has led the pack since 1977 and does so while spending only about 6.5 percent of its gross national product on health care. The United States, near the bottom of all the rich countries in life expectancy, spends about 15 percent of its gross national product on health care.
The major cause of our dismal showing is the widening income distribution between rich and poor (front page, Sept. 14) and men and women (front page, Sept. 15). No other factor has been shown to influence a nation's health more than measures of income distribution: a country with a more unequal income distribution than another country will have a lower life expectancy.

HEADLINE: Poor N.J. Drivers Save Under Insurance Plan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Sept. 17 news article on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's auto insurance proposal for New Jersey reports that most drivers would not save more than $100 to $200 on their premiums. However, according to a study by the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress, the average savings for a New Jersey motorist who chooses to forgo pain and suffering coverage -- one of the options under the Whitman plan -- would be $342. Low-income drivers would save the most. 
 You also report that experts believe that auto insurance in New Jersey will always be expensive because it is the most densely populated state. Auto insurance rates correlate with many factors, including the percentage of claims in which there is lawyer representation. In New Jersey, 92 percent of those injured in auto accidents who make claims against other drivers use attorneys. This is the highest percentage in the country -- the national average is 52 percent.
Another reason auto insurance rates are the highest in New Jersey is that the Legislature there has passed a law mandating a benefits package that is five times higher than New York's.

People Power 2: A Sleeping Giant Is Awakened

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: MANILA, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Corazon C. Aquino, former President of the Philippines and champion of the "people power" uprising 11 years ago, sat in her car the other day and honked her horn.
Church bells chimed and people stood in windows and doorways shouting and banging on pots and pans in a Philippine ritual of protest called a noise barrage. 
 And from all around the political landscape in the last few weeks, from churchmen, lawyers and business groups, came the catcalls: "warlord . . . dictator . . . dark ages . . . selfish and immoral . . . tentacles of evil . . . a mad dog gone berserk."
Why all the noise?
It appears that President Fidel V. Ramos, a former general known for his complex game plans, has roused the ghosts of dictators past.
Apparently trying to keep opponents off balance and avoid becoming a lame duck, he has allowed his backers to try to change the Constitution and keep him in office after his single six-year term ends next June.
It is a question of fierce debate here whether Mr. Ramos really wants to hold on to the presidency -- as Ferdinand E. Marcos did by declaring martial law in 1972 -- or is simply trying to keep control of the political agenda.
Some political analysts dismiss the idea that Mr. Ramos would seize power through martial law, and the President himself has denied that he would do so.
But whatever his motives, he has succeeded in rousing the nation against him at the end of one of the most successful administrations in Philippine history, a time when the country has just begun to emerge from decades of economic ruin.
He is discovering the high price that Filipinos place on the chief legacy of his predecessor, Mrs. Aquino: the restoration of democracy.
In a region where stability and economic growth are the highest values and where democratic openness tends to take a back seat -- in countries like Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia -- the Philippines stands apart for its dedication to freedom.
"The moment you start talking about extending anybody's term, the Marcos ghost starts to rise," said Paulynn Sicam, a newspaper columnist. "I wrote in my column: 'We'll survive any President, but no President can survive us.' We took Marcos out. We can take out anybody. We know what our power is."
All around the city, people are reveling in a re-creation of the symbols of their democratic triumph of 1986, when huge crowds supporting a military mutiny blocked tanks and drove Mr. Marcos into exile in Hawaii, where he died in 1989.
They are tying yellow ribbons to trees, lighting candles and throwing buckets of yellow confetti from tall buildings as groups of marchers pass by with signs reading, "No to Cha-Cha," the popular nickname for Charter Change.
"My fear is that the same thing is happening to President Ramos that happened to Mr. Marcos -- that he is beginning to believe that he is indispensable," said Rafael Khan, a lawyer, who attended a rally today. "He must respect the rule of law."
On Sunday -- the 25th anniversary of Mr. Marcos's declaration of martial law -- Mrs. Aquino and her most powerful ally, Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, plan to hold a mass demonstration on the Luneta parade ground that recalls the brave protests of "people power."
"It's exciting all over again," said Narzalina Lim, chairwoman of the program committee for the rally. "So much deja vu."
In fact, the political situation holds almost no similarity with 1986. One of the leaders of that peaceful uprising, Mr. Ramos has repeatedly demonstrated his allegiance to democracy, first by defending Mrs. Aquino from a half-dozen coup attempts, then with a notably open and consultative style as President.
The chief parallel in the two situations is the miscalculation by Mr. Marcos and Mr. Ramos of the country's political mood. Mr. Marcos seemed to think that Filipinos could be bullied; Mr. Ramos underestimated their fear of dictatorship.
"Why is there a hate campaign against all of us?" the President asked this month. "Why have we become demons all of a sudden?"
Mrs. Lim said the rally on Sunday would include at least four of the country's proliferating potential candidates to succeed Mr. Ramos.
Among them will be Vice President Joseph Estrada, who may be most responsible for all of the turmoil over succession. Mr. Estrada is a former movie star who is viewed as Mr. Ramos's most likely successor because of his broad popularity.
His candidacy is dreaded by the political establishment, which sees him as a blustering lightweight incapable of carrying on Mr. Ramos's legacy of economic reforms. A strong motive behind the movement to change the Constitution is a belief that Mr. Ramos is the only person who could beat him.
One of Mr. Estrada's most formidable assets is his off-the-cuff charm. At a recent open forum, a young man told him, "My mother says she will leave the Philippines if you are elected."
Mr. Estrada responded with a broad smile. "Then tell her to start packing!" he exclaimed.

HEADLINE: Battle of What May Be the West's Last Big Dam

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DURANGO, Colo.

 BODY:
Two years ago, the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund objected to a $700 million water diversion project planned for the Animas River here and proposed a $264 million alternative.
This summer, Ute Indian leaders, the project's proponents, reluctantly bent to Washington's budget-cutting mood and announced a $257 million plan. 
 Then the defense fund countered with a new proposal for a $115 million dam.
"Double-crossing" was the adjective used by editorial writers for both of Denver's dailies to describe the way environmentalists moved the goal posts on what may be the West's last big water project.
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Republican Senator from Colorado and the lone American Indian in Congress, joined the fray, saying: "The enviros have never been interested in a compromise. They just simply want to stop development and growth. And the way you do that in the West is to stop water."
The wrangling in Durango over what is now a medium-sized reservoir project highlights the death throes of a dam-building and water-diversion culture that in this century built 600 dams and reservoirs across the West. Cheap, subsidized water allowed the growth of great cities and the growth of cheap food to feed the new populations. Without piped water, Los Angeles might still be a provincial coastal town, and Las Vegas might be a gas station in the desert.
But with the growth of environmental opposition to tinkering with the West's natural plumbing, the number of new dams slowed greatly in the 1970's and then finally stopped in the 1990's.
"Big subsidized water projects are on their way out," said Robert B. Wiygul, a lawyer for Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, the new name for the Sierra Club's fund. Rejecting the "double-crossing" label of the Denver newspapers, he said, "The idea that we should embrace the first compromise thrown out by the proponents is just outrageous."
The West's water paralysis is most evident in this southwest Colorado town, just north of the Southern Ute Indian Reservation and the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation.
In 1868, Kit Carson negotiated a deal with the Utes: they would give up claims to Colorado's western half in return for a permanent home in the new territory's far southwest corner. This dry, semi-desert reservation land was arguably the worst in Colorado for farming, but the 1868 treaty stipulated Government aid. Later, courts ruled that this assistance included water.
With Indian water rights a low priority to white settlers, the water wheel moved slowly. In 1938, a Bureau of Reclamation office opened here to study a diversion project. In 1968, Congress authorized the project. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a law needed to go ahead.
But, while the Indians waited, political gridlock turned the project into a bonanza for water lawyers, political lobbyists, fish biologists, civil engineers and authors of environmental impact statements. If the $77 million that has been appropriated since 1988 for the project had been given directly to the 3,300 Utes who live here, each Ute would have received a $23,000 check.
Instead, no earth has been turned, and no end is in sight to the legal and bureaucratic jousting.
"In 1990, the endangered fish came up and bit us," Sam Maynes, a water lawyer for the Southern Utes, said of an environmental lawsuit. The new slimmed-down version of the project would divert only 14.5 percent of the Animas River's annual flow, presumably not enough to disturb two rare fish species -- the Colorado squawfish and the razorback sucker.
Although the Bureau of Reclamation has written an environmental impact statement that fills four feet of bookshelves, environmentalists say that a new statement would be be needed for the smaller alternative, "Animas-La Plata Lite," as it is universally called here.
These arguments seem otherworldly to Judy Knight Frank, chairwoman of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe, an impoverished people who survived until 1994 on water delivered by trucks.
"That squawfish -- and I take offense at that name -- seems to have more of a right to live than I do," said Ms. Frank, who presides over a tribe where unemployment is about 50 percent and household income hovers around $9,000. "The environmentalists don't seem to care how we live."
Sage Remington, director of a Ute splinter group opposed to the project, counters that the project was never intended to pipe or channel water to Ute Mountain Ute lands, which start 25 miles west of the reservoir site.
The reservoir, which would be on the northern border of the Southern Ute lands, is largely seen by Indian advocates as "a bucket." Instead of having abstract "paper water," or water rights on a deed, they would have "wet water," stored in a reservoir like money in the bank.
Water could be sold to Durango, a booming tourist town that experienced water shortages in the summer of 1996. Or water could be sold to non-Indian farmers. Historically a nomadic, horse-riding people, the Utes today largely disdain farming. Most of the tribe's income comes from a horse track, a casino and coal-bed methane gas royalties.
Mr. Remington has proposed an alternative way to settle his tribe's water claims: buying land and accompanying water rights on the open market. But critics say that under Colorado water law, this agricultural water could not be converted easily to other uses.
The hidden agenda behind the water fight, tribal officers and environmentalists agree, is that a reservoir filled with "municipal and industrial" water would allow the Southern Utes to mine their enormous coal reserves. When gas royalties run out, a coal slurry pipeline would allow the Utes to ship their low-sulphur coal -- 400 million tons lies near the surface -- to coal-burning power plants in the Four Corners area.
But, when environmentalists talk about strip mining and air quality, Indian leaders talk about mining royalties and high-paying jobs.
"Why do these people keep telling us what to do?" Ms. Frank, the Ute Mountain Utes chairwoman, asked angrily. "We are going to be on welfare, and the country is going to be taking care of us. Is that what they want?"
With feelings high here, the debate has not always been civil.
Last year, when the water project's price tag seemed to approach $1 billion, environmentalists derided it as "a white elephant wrapped in an Indian blanket." One white opponent formed a one-man group, Stop Campbell's Animas La Plata, or Scalp.
On the other side, Jeff Morrissey, a former mayor of Durango, lost his temper last fall when he saw a young woman park her car emblazoned with a bumper sticker that criticized Animas. He yelled out a crude remark and was cited for disorderly conduct.
Durango and water politics have changed since the late 1970's, when Mr. Morrissey was the Mayor here.
Rafters and trout fishermen now have a voice in the future of a river that flows through town. In the 1990's, the number of tourists who went down the Animas on commercial raft trips has tripled, hitting 30,000 in 1995. This summer, the Colorado Wildlife Commission, a state group, designated the river stretch below Durango a "Gold Medal Stream," an honor reserved for less than 2 percent of Colorado's 9,000 miles of trout streams.
Nationally, what 30 years ago would have been a run-of-the-mill Western water project now finds itself in Washington's spotlight, appearing on one Congressman's "pork" list and on an environmental group's "endangered rivers" list.
"That combination of national environmental organizations and fiscal conservatives is just deadly," Mr. Maynes said. In 1968 he had watched from the galleries, full of hope, when Congress authorized the project.

HEADLINE: What Makes Ted Turner Give? Others' Examples.

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
A soaring stock market, the end of the cold war and the examples set by such disparate figures as Mother Teresa, Jacques Cousteau and Diana, the Princess of Wales, inspired Ted Turner to pledge as much as $1 billion over 10 years, but possibly less, to support United Nations programs.
In a telephone conference call yesterday with several reporters, Mr. Turner, the unpredictable founder of Cable News Network, discussed the motives underlying what may turn out to be the largest single pledge in philanthropic history. He also described in general terms the structure of his planned gift, although United Nations officials and Mr. Turner's financial and philanthropic advisers agreed that specific arrangements had yet to be decided. 
 Mr. Turner said he would give away grants totaling a billion dollars worth of Time Warner stock valued at current prices or $100 million a year for 10 years, whichever is less. That means that if the stock price falls, Mr. Turner, who is vice chairman of Time Warner, could wind up giving away less than $100 million a year. On the other hand, if the value of the stock increases, he said, he would still limit his gift to $1 billion.
There were some early indications that giving away the money might be far more complicated than either he or the United Nations anticipated when he announced the donation in a speech on Thursday at the annual United Nations Association dinner in New York.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, who yesterday called the pledge "a wonderful gesture," said he thought the money would go into a fund at the United Nations and be managed in accordance with the organization's rules. But Mr. Turner's spokesmen said that Mr. Turner wanted to create an independent, private foundation whose board would work with United Nations officials to decide where the money would go.
Spokesmen for both Mr. Turner and the United Nations agreed that the United Nations can accept direct gifts only from governments and that Mr. Turner's gift would not be used to defray the organization's operating costs. Nor would it help pay off the debt that the United States owes the United Nations, though Mr. Turner said yesterday that he had toyed with the idea of "buying the U.S. debt and presenting the bill to Congress." (Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said yesterday that agreement was near on a deal in which the United States would pay nearly $1 billion that it owes to the world organization.)
Mr. Turner did not say, and his aides did not know, whether he would put the total value of the stock into the new foundation all at once, which would make it one of only 35 American foundations with assets of $1 billion or more, or add $100 million each year to the pool of foundation funds. Because Mr. Turner plans to give the money away over a 10-year-period, what could be a billion-dollar gift must be somewhat discounted because the later portions will be worth less as forces like inflation erode the gift's value.
Peter Bahouth, the executive director of Mr. Turner's private family foundation, which will give away $26 million in fiscal 1998, said Mr. Turner had told him yesterday that he wanted to insure that the new foundation would be able to accept donations from other wealthy donors.
Mr. Turner said that the foundation would not bear his name and that very few people knew in advance of his plans. Secretary General Annan told reporters yesterday that although Mr. Turner had been talking about a gift "for quite some time," the media executive told him only Thursday afternoon that he was going to announce the pledge that night. Mr. Turner said that on Wednesday night over dinner, he had discussed the idea with his wife, Jane Fonda, and that she had cried with joy. "Jane thinks it's terrific," one of her spokesman said today.
John C. Whitehead, a former Deputy Secretary of State and executive director of the United Nations Association, said that skepticism from some philanthropy experts about whether Mr. Turner would really make a billion-dollar gift was unfair. "Americans should be saying, 'Isn't that wonderful that the guy is giving away a third of his net worth to an organization he believes in.' "
President Clinton welcomed the gift through a spokesman, and Ms. Albright praised the "extraordinarily generous" act, but added that it would not affect the United States' demands for reform at the United Nations.
Mr. Turner's pledge, said Sara Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center, a New York-based group that monitors giving, puts him among America's most generous donors, especially in international affairs, where donations tend to be smaller and constitute only about 10 percent of total American giving. These include such benefactors as Walter Annenberg, who has given away more than a billion dollars, mostly for education; Charles F. Feeney, who quietly gave away $610 million and put $3.5 billion into a charitable foundation, and George Soros, the financier who has given away close to $1.5 billion and whom Mr. Turner identified yesterday as the philanthropist he most admires.
Mr. Turner said that he was also inspired by the good works of Mother Teresa, Jacques Cousteau and Diana. Asked why he gave to charity at all, Mr. Turner replied: "Well it's just say 'yes.' " The end of the cold war, he added, means that "war has become impossible" and that the world should concentrate instead on solving social and economic ills. "We live in an interconnected planet," said Mr. Turner, one of the nation's largest landowners.
Mr. Turner said, "I've been learning how to give. It's something you have to keep working on, because people like money the way they do their homes and their dogs."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
For years, religious leaders have lamented the absence of any major television series that took religious life and spiritual struggles seriously. The popular blend of therapeutic wisdom and supernatural gimmickry of "Touched by an Angel" and its knock-offs was not what they had in mind.
Now reviewers are hailing "Nothing Sacred," the ABC series about an edgy, dedicated Roman Catholic priest that debuted Thursday. Faith and doubt, fidelity and ambiguity, the questioning of both church and self, they argued, were woven winningly and realistically into a well-written, well-acted drama of a young pastor and the motley staff trying to hold together an urban parish. 
 If some conservative Catholics objected to the series and were even calling for a boycott of its sponsors, wasn't that all the more evidence of its strengths?
There is little question that "Nothing Sacred" is a cut above the vacuity, violence and sexual fantasy of much television entertainment. But if the realism and complexity of "Nothing Sacred" breaks out of the framework of most religious programming, it may not break out as far as some admirers seem to think.
Yes, Father Ray, with his temper tantrums, working hormones and occasional profanity, contrasts with Bing Crosby's crooning Father Chuck, the good-guy priest in "Going My Way" and "The Bells of St. Mary's." But to what extent is Father Ray simply a liberal good-guy priest?
There are stereotypes and then there are stereotypes. In "Nothing Sacred," the Rev. Gregory Coiro of the Los Angeles archdiocese points out, "the heroic priest is the one who bucks the church, and, by sheer coincidence, just happens to buck the church on all the issues -- sex and abortion -- where Hollywood is bucking the church."
Father Coiro, the diocesan director of media relations, has been reviewing the scripts of "Nothing Sacred," at ABC's request, for inaccurate or offensive material, although the network does not necessarily follow his recommendations.
Neither Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles nor the Catholic bishops generally has expressed a public opinion on "Nothing Sacred," but Father Coiro's personal view is that the series "is not a fair depiction of the priesthood."
"The basic premise," he said of the pilot broadcast, "is that the only good Catholic is a bad Catholic."
The Rev. Ellwood Kieser, a priest of the Paulist order who has produced feature films about Dorothy Day and Archbishop Oscar Romero, does not agree.
"I like it," he said of the series. "I don't think it is perfect, but conflict is of the essence of drama, and so is surprise and shock. A priest struggling with his faith, his celibacy and the bishop's office is dramatic" -- and not unrealistic, he said. "Saints have had tensions with authority, and so have had most priests."
Father Kieser did underline "things that stretched credibility" on Thursday night's broadcast. "I don't know many priests who would tell a woman no more than to follow her own conscience in regard to an abortion," he said, "and who would so distance themselves from what the church teaches."
He also found implausible a sermon in which Father Ray calls for a moratorium on confessing sexual sins. "Some people need to confront their sexual sins," Father Kieser said.
There were other lapses, puzzling in a program that ABC announced was written by a pseudonymous Jesuit. Moderately well-informed Catholics, even dissenters, realize that their church does not treat abortion primarily as a sexual question like contraception but rather a question of taking life, on the level of issues like capital punishment, limits in warfare and euthanasia. Not Father Ray.
Catholic bishops do not order priests to give Sunday sermons on topics like Thomas Aquinas's proofs for the existence of God, and Father Ray's snippet of a sermon was less Aquinas anyway than 19th-century popular theology.
But Father Kieser, who believes "Nothing Sacred" should be on at 10 p.m. instead of 8 ("It's an adult show"), has high hopes anyway.
"The press and the network really beat the drums on how controversial this program is," he said, recalling the flap over nudity on the first episode of "NYPD Blue."
"That series turned out to be good," he said, and this one features "some lovely twists, and realistically pulls us into the theological world."
Ultimately, of course, the appearance of a program like "Nothing Sacred" poses a challenge that conservative Catholics probably sense instinctively without quite articulating. That is the question of control.
Suppose that the opening episodes met absolutely everyone's standards, dramtically and theologically. Who's to predict the series' course if ratings are low? Will Father Ray announce he is bisexual? (An H.I.V.-positive priest is already written into a future script.) Will Sister Maureen start celebrating Mass? Is a network the newest claimant to theological authority?
Once upon a time churches could count on deference, sustained by public protectiveness about religious sensibilities. The groups threatening an economic boycott of the new show's sponsors would like to demonstrate that such a time has not passed. But as long as so many faithful, of whatever religious group, get their theology from the media rather than the pulpit, religious leadership will be hard-pressed to control how their own tradition is presented.
The long-awaited serious religious programming, in other words, could turn out to be a two-edged sword.

HEADLINE: Mexican Drug Dealer Tried to Buy Way Out, General Says

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Six months before his apparent death in July, the billionaire Mexican drug trafficker Amado Carrillo Fuentes sent his top lieutenant to negotiate with the Mexican Army for protection from prosecution, the country's disgraced former anti-drug chief, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, testified on Thursday.
General Gutierrez is on trial on drug and other charges. His testimony and documents that have surfaced in recent weeks offer new details about the last days of one of the world's leading drug traffickers. They suggest that Mr. Carrillo was trying to lessen his role in the drug business and wanted to make huge payoffs to buy peace for his family. 
 Mexican officials did not accept the offer, though the details of the negotiations, and why they ultimately fell apart, remain a mystery.
Responding to the general's testimony, the army's senior prosecutor acknowledged today in an interview that the trafficker's top lieutenant met with five generals from the army's General Staff in January.
The prosecutor, Gen. Marcial Macedo de la Concha, asserted that the generals did not know until weeks later that they had met with a representative of Mexico's top trafficker.
But other sworn testimony in General Gutierrez's trial, and army intelligence documents published earlier this year, indicate that in January military officials heard a proposal from Mr. Carrillo in which the trafficker pledged to minimize the violence associated with the drug trade and "act like a businessman, not like a criminal."
In exchange, Mr. Carrillo wanted to keep half of his immense fortune and to receive assurances that he and his family would be protected from anti-drug operatives, the documents indicate.
Events since that January meeting suggest that the trafficker's offer was eventually turned down, but it remains unclear who made the decision and why.
In early February, Mr. Carrillo began traveling outside Mexico, visiting Cuba, Chile and, some officials say, even Russia during the first half of this year. In Chile, Mr. Carrillo made real estate and other investments aimed at establishing a residence there. In early July, the American and Mexican Governments announced Mr. Carrillo's death from complications of plastic surgery.
Throughout this decade, Mr. Carrillo had carried out his smuggling operations with extraordinary license, moving hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into Mexico in planes and boats and north into the United States. He traveled throughout Mexico freely.
American officials have estimated that he paid as much as 60 percent or more of his billion-dollar revenues to the police, politicians and generals in Mexico to buy protection.
In 1996 Mr. Carrillo's top lieutenant, Eduardo Gonzalez Quirarte, a Guadalajara businessman, established friendly contacts with General Gutierrez, then the commander of a military region encompassing much of central Mexico. As a result of those contacts, General Gutierrez was arrested in February.
During General Gutierrez's trial, evidence has emerged that Mr. Carrillo succeeded in bribing other generals, but the details are sketchy.
The events suggest that starting in late 1996, at a time when his fame had spread worldwide, Mr. Carrillo lost his influence with Mexico's security forces. In early January he barely escaped a raid by army anti-narcotics troops on the wedding party of Mr. Carrillo's sister in the western state of Sinaloa. He managed to flee his mother's ranch hidden in a farm truck.
It was in that context that Mr. Carrillo's representatives met with the top generals in the Mexican Army. General Gutierrez testified on Thursday that Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte had met on three occasions with generals from the army's general staff, twice in December and again on Jan. 14.
Military intelligence documents published by the magazine Proceso in July appeared to shed light on details of the Jan. 14 meeting. Among the papers was one dated Jan. 14, indexed by army officers as a "document of exposition of hypotheses about an offer from a narcotics trafficker." The document appears to refer to Mr. Carrillo by his initials, A.C.:
"A.C. does not intend to surrender. A.C. wants to negotiate with the Government, to make a pact."
The document says he requested:
*That he be allowed to act.
*Peace for his family.
*50 percent of his possessions.
The document says he offered:
*To collaborate to get rid of unorganized narcotics trafficking.
*To act like a businessman, not like a criminal.
*Not to sell drugs in Mexico.
*To sell the drugs outside the country. U.S. and Europe.
*To bring dollars to help the country, its economy.
*Not to act violently, not in rebellion.
"If the pact is not accepted, he will take his offer, with its 'benefits,' to another country," the document says.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN FINANCE: THE HEARING;
Witness Says Clinton Aide Asked Him to Shred a Fax

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
An unemployed businessman from Florida testified today that a few days before last year's Presidential election, he was asked by Harold M. Ickes, then the top political officer in the White House, to donate $1.5 million to help President Clinton and then, a few hours later, to shred a fax that described the request.
The businessman, R. Warren Meddoff, said Mr. Ickes got his name from a business card Mr. Meddoff had managed to slip to the President at a fund-raising dinner. Mr. Meddoff said he had written on the back of the card, "I have a business associate that is interested in donating $5 million to your campaign." 
 No suggestion was made that money ever changed hands. After Democrats researched Mr. Meddoff's background, they decided not to pursue Mr. Ickes's request for money. Mr. Ickes has said that he made a mistake in talking to Mr. Meddoff, and has denied in a sworn statement to the Senate committee investigating campaign finance practices that he ever asked for the fax to be destroyed.
Republican Senators on the investigating panel, the Governmental Affairs Committee, said the Meddoff case was another example of reckless Democratic fund-raising last year. Democrats challenged Mr. Meddoff's credibility.
The story Mr. Meddoff told sounded a bit like an Elmore Leonard novel about small-time wheeling and dealing. Basically, it went like this:
For seven years, Mr. Meddoff had been in "extensive daily contact" with William R. Morgan, a Texan whom he has never met face to face. Mr. Morgan had a scheme to make a fortune selling pre-World War II German bonds, and Mr. Meddoff was supposed to get a cut.
In 1995, Mr. Meddoff, a former Republican county official in Florida, wrote to Mr. Clinton and to Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, and offered them $5 million if the United States Government kept its hands off and the bond deal went through. He never heard back from the President and got a routine cold shoulder from the Dole staff.
Last October, Mr. Meddoff told Mr. Morgan that the Danish company he then worked for in Florida was paying for him to go to a fund-raising dinner for Mr. Clinton in Coral Gables and they decided that Mr. Meddoff should renew the $5 million offer. That was when he gave the President the business card.
A few days later, Mr. Ickes, then the deputy White House chief of staff, called Mr. Meddoff from Air Force One. Mr. Meddoff told Mr. Ickes that Mr. Morgan had authorized him to offer an initial contribution of $5 million and an additional $5 million a month for 10 months, for a total of $55 million.
Mr. Meddoff also told Mr. Ickes that the contribution had to be tax deductible. Direct political contributions cannot be deducted.
The week before Election Day, Mr. Ickes called Mr. Meddoff back and said he needed $1.5 million immediately, according to Mr. Meddoff's testimony, and also sent a fax listing three tax-exempt organizations to which Mr. Meddoff could donate. One of the organizations was Vote Now '96, an obscure organization that promoted voter registration in black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
A few hours later, Mr. Ickes called back again, said the fax had been sent by mistake and told Mr. Meddoff to shred it. Mr. Meddoff did not do so. Mr. Ickes kept a copy of the fax in his files and gave it to the investigating committee.
The story more or less ends there. Mr. Morgan, Mr. Meddoff said, wanted a letter from someone official thanking him by name for the donation and saying it was in support of the President. By that point, the evidence showed, the Democrats had researched Mr. Meddoff's and Mr. Morgan's backgrounds and had decided not to deal with them further.
When the letter they wanted was not forthcoming, Mr. Meddoff said, Mr. Morgan decided not to make the contribution.
It is illegal for money to be filtered into political campaigns through tax-exempt organizations.
Lanny J. Davis, the White House spokesman on campaign finance matters, said today that Mr. Ickes had sent the names of groups whose work might benefit the President indirectly.
Mr. Davis said higher voter turnout in black neighborhoods, for example, could be expected to help Mr. Clinton on Election Day.
Democratic Senators said Mr. Meddoff's tale was not credible; they noted that Mr. Morgan lives in a rented house, has tax liens against him and clearly does not have anywhere near the resources to give the amounts of money he was talking about.
Senator John Glenn of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the panel, noted that Mr. Meddoff had never made a dime from his relationship with Mr. Morgan and suggested that Mr. Meddoff had been conned.
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the chairman of the investigating committee, agreed that Mr. Meddoff's tale was "bizarre and difficult to comprehend."
Still, Mr. Thompson, a Republican, said, he could not understand how Mr. Ickes could talk about millions of dollars with "someone that he does not know, who is purportedly dealing on behalf of someone else whom he does not know."

HEADLINE: Timothy Joyce, 63, a Pioneer in Market Research

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Timothy Joyce, a pioneer in the field of magazine readership research, died on Sept. 13 in Manhattan. He was 63 years old.
Mr. Joyce had long been suffering from hepatitis, said Alain Tessier, a friend and business colleague. 
 Mr. Joyce was born, raised and educated in Britain, receiving a Ph.D. from Cambridge University, and he began his career in market research in London. In the 1960's, as a director of the British Market Research Bureau, he developed a survey system for measuring a magazine's total audience, which included pass-along readership and reading done on airplanes.
In 1972, Mr. Joyce introduced the more extensive magazine readership survey methodology to the United States, when he joined J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, as a research director.
The survey system Mr. Joyce helped devise and championed seems common sense today, but it was considered a significant advance at the time. It was a research method that was particularly in step with changing social trends as more and more women were entering the work force, doing more of their reading outside the home.
In 1977, Mr. Joyce returned to London to become media director of J. Walter Thompson there. Two years later, Mr. Joyce returned to New York to become a founder of Mediamark Research Inc., a magazine readership research company.
In 1979, Mediamark was the upstart challenger to the American giant in the field of magazine readership research, Simmons Market Research Bureau.
Mr. Joyce left Mediamark in 1991 to work with A. C. Nielsen to develop a system of measuring media markets using point-of-sale scanning technology, called Homescan. At the time of his death, Mr. Joyce was the vice chairman of the research company, Roper Starch Worldwide.
A former president of the Market Research Council, Mr. Joyce was elected to the professional group's hall of fame in 1995.
Mr. Joyce is survived by his second wife, Helen, whom he married in 1988. His marriage to his first wife, Barbara Joyce, ended in divorce. Mr. Joyce is also survived by a son, Nicholas, of Bristol, England, and a daughter, Rachel Frosh, of London.

N.B.A. Contract in Need Of Change, Stern Says

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 19

 BODY:
The labor peace that Commissioner David Stern worked so diligently to keep in the National Basketball Association two years ago may be threatened again as early as next spring.
Stern and Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik acknowledged today that the league would strongly consider reopening the collective bargaining agreement signed between the players and the owners in August 1995. Between exorbitant salaries and loopholes around the salary cap, Stern is apparently willing to go back to the bargaining table to fix the economic disparities between the teams in his league. 
 The league can reopen the talks at its option, without the players association's approval. Though no action can be taken until April, one of the worst-case scenarios involves a league-imposed lockout to begin the 1998-99 season.
"We remain eternal optimists in the face of reality," Stern said during an informal news conference at the annual league meetings. "In some ways," he added, "the current collective bargaining agreement is a vast improvement over former agreements -- in terms of 50 different loopholes, balloon payments and salaries to untried rookies for the long term."
But the agreement has also led to a culture of rule-bending by teams and players hamstrung by the salary cap. Given the recent refusal of a $103 million contract extension by Kevin Garnett in Minnesota, the league is particularly concerned about players spurning major dollars for paltry, one-year deals that often lead to a long-term contract with a team now over the salary cap.
Stern and Granik said the recent victory in arbitration by the veteran center Chris Dudley was a prime example of their concern. "I think the Dudley decision is a particularly damaging one with the way we had hoped the new salary cap system would have worked," Granik said.
An arbitrator ruled two weeks ago that Dudley could move from Portland to New York in a sign-and-trade deal consummated by the teams in August. Dudley opted out of a contract worth three years and $13 million in Portland and turned down multiyear offers from other franchises to sign a one-year deal with the Blazers with the notion that they would trade him to the Knicks.
The league argued that an alleged unwritten agreement between Dudley and New York -- in which the Knicks would compensate Dudley with a multiyear deal after this season because he would become their own free agent and his salary would not count against the cap -- circumvented the rules.
The league appealed the decision. Both sides are awaiting the selection of a three-member arbitration panel to review the appeal. But if the appeal is shot down, the league thinks it will not be long before other imaginative maneuvers are used by team officials and players.
"One of the principal tenets here is that you should be encouraged to create salary cap room if you want to go after free agents," Granik said. "And having created salary cap room, perhaps more salary cap room than anybody else, you should be able to gauge what your competition is. Instead, if players are able to make deals where they receive only a relatively small amount of money in the first year because they know they'll get it back in later years, that eliminates that part of the system."
Stern also addressed character issues, adding that the league is wrestling with franchises' enforcement of uniform code-of-conduct rules. "We are concerned about our ability to help our athletes by holding them to standards that say that criminal conduct is not an acceptable part of life in the N.B.A.," he said.
But most of his time was spent detailing the problems and concerns involving the two-year-old labor agreement, a six-year pact that may not make it to its third year.
"The last couple of years when we were heading into our last bargaining agreement, things were heading in the wrong direction," Stern said. "Our concern is whether or not we can extend the gains we made in the first two years of the new deal. If not, then some action might be inevitable."
Added Granik, "We have no choice but to keep working to build a better mousetrap."

Jobless Rate at 7-Year Low

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate fell in August to 5.2 percent, the lowest jobless rate in seven years, the state's Department of Labor said yesterday. The rate in July was 5.4 percent.
But the news was less positive on another closely watched measure. In July, New Jersey had stood on the verge of becoming the first state in the New York City metropolitan region to regain the same number of jobs that were lost in the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's. It was a symbolic threshold that many economists expected New Jersey to cross in August. 
 Instead, the state fell back, losing 8,300 jobs, state officials said, mainly because of the effects of the strike at United Parcel Service. The state has about 10,300 U.P.S. employees, officials said.
As of August, New Jersey had regained 254,000 jobs through five years of the recovery, or about 97 percent of the jobs lost in the recession. Many of the jobs that were lost were in manufacturing, while the new ones tend to be lower-paying jobs in the service industry.

August Jobless Rate Fell To Its Lowest in 7 Years

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent in August, the lowest jobless rate in seven years, the state's Department of Labor said yesterday. The rate in July was 5.4 percent.
But the news was less positive by another closely watched measure. In July, New Jersey stood on the verge of becoming the first state in the New York City metropolitan region to regain all the jobs that were lost in the deep recession of the late 1980's and early 90's. It was a symbolic threshold that many economists had expected the state to cross in August. 
 But New Jersey fell back instead, losing 8,300 jobs, state officials said, mainly because of the effects of the teamsters' union strike at United Parcel Service. New Jersey has about 10,300 U.P.S. employees, the state officials said.
As of August, New Jersey had regained 254,000 jobs through five years of recovery, or about 97 percent of the jobs lost in the recession. New York State, which has not yet reported its August job count, had regained 319,000 jobs, or about 55 percent of its losses as of July.
Connecticut had added 101,000 through July, recovering about 65 percent, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The Fusion Quest
 By T. Kenneth Fowler.
 Illustrated. 250 pp. Baltimore:
 The Johns Hopkins University Press. $29.95. 
 DREAMS of fueling the world with water (or something just as plentiful) have inspired countless charlatans to hawk fraudulent additives and machines for converting water into fuel. But the dream has also engaged the creative energy of many gifted scientists who believe that one day unlimited electric energy will be produced by the same natural process that fuels the sun.
However, controlled hydrogen fusion -- the continuous joining together of the nuclei of hydrogen atoms -- has proved to be a far tougher nut to crack than optimists believed in the 1950's after the first thermonuclear bombs were detonated. Critics of fusion research sneer that fusion is the energy source of the future -- and always will be. Congress has grown bored with expensive fusion experiments that never result in the sustained thermonuclear burning of hydrogen fuel. Consequently, research funds for most (but not all) fusion research have dried up.
Earlier this year the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey was forced by reductions in Federal funding to shut down its huge Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, the largest fusion machine of its type ever built. Proponents of fusion research like T. Kenneth Fowler, the author of "The Fusion Quest," were embittered. Although the reactor did not achieve ignition, they acknowledge, it did produce brief pulses of fusion power as high as 10 million watts.
But the light at the end of the fusion tunnel has remained discouragingly dim. The problem is scale. The heating and squeezing together of hydrogen nuclei works fine in a reactor the size of the sun, where stupendous and uniform gravitational forces compress the entire star into a reasonably smooth sphere. The solar fusion system efficiently contains its hydrogen fuel, which therefore keeps burning. But an earthbound reactor is much smaller, so its fuel must be confined by something other than gravity: either a complex web of interlocking magnetic fields or the violent, machine-gun-like implosions of many pea-sized capsules of thermonuclear fuel.
Fowler, one of America's leading experts in plasma physics (the physics of ultra-hot, electrically charged gases, including fusion fuel), has spent a lifetime pursuing the fusion dream. His employers have included Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the General Atomics Company of San Diego and the University of California, Berkeley. He also served as a Government adviser on fusion problems, and few scientists have as broad an understanding of the labyrinthine problems fusion researchers confront.
Not surprisingly, he is an ardent partisan of fusion research. His book argues that there has been important progress in recent years and that the commercial exploitation of fusion power will be attainable, even if it takes 50 years or more. But Fowler makes his case awkwardly, encumbering his prose with so much technical detail that a lay reader may end up feeling bewildered. Evidently he could not decide whether to write an overview for ordinary readers of a textbook for engineering students. The reader plows through this book and must survive many brushes with difficult physics, engineering and mathematics. At its conclusion there is even a 10-page appendix (replete with equations) called "Designing Your Own Fusion Reactor." "The Fusion Quest" also fails to take note of some rather cogent arguments against the promise of hydrogen fusion that have been put forward by experts at the Electric Power Research Institute and various universities.
Most of the book deals with physical and engineering difficulties involved in satisfying the "Lawson criterion" -- a function of plasma pressure and energy confinement time in a thermonuclear reaction. If the Lawson number can be pushed high enough, Fowler explains, a sustained thermonuclear reaction can be ignited. Heating a mixture of deuterium and tritium fuels to more than 72 million degrees Fahrenheit in a very large reactor, he says, should do the job, provided the gas remains efficiently confined. (The reader will notice that the probable fuel for "hydrogen" fusion reactors is not ordinary hydrogen; instead, it is likely to be a mixture of two much rarer forms of hydrogen: deuterium, a trace component of sea water, and tritium, a radioactive hydrogen isotope produced by fission reactors burning uranium.)
There are other tricky requirements; for instance, most heating of the thermonuclear fuel must come from fast-moving alpha particles (helium nuclei). Alpha particles are produced by the fusion reaction itself, but they are difficult to corral. Another engineering nightmare is transporting useful heat from a fusion reactor's core to an electric generation plant. The heat must be extracted from neutrons spawned by the reactor, and as these particles speed away from the thermonuclear furnace they must be captured by some liquid coolant. The problems involved in making this neutron-absorbing "blanket," experts agree, are formidable.
Fowler frequently lapses into the annoying pedagogical habit of inserting "simple" or "well-known" in front of jargon that is left inadequately explained; the reader may feel shamed by not knowing what the author considers obvious. A case in point is his reference to the "well-known" Rayleigh-Taylor instability, one of the nastiest problems in controlled fusion. Some popularizers of fusion physics describe this phenomenon as what is seen when a bottle of oil and vinegar is inverted. The oil rises, not uniformly but in a chaotic pattern of thrusts up into the unstable vinegar layer. Hydrogen plasma trying to escape a confining magnetic field behaves the same way, greatly complicating the task of keeping it in place; it is as difficult to confine the plasma within the needed shape and volume as it is to manually squeeze a greased balloon into a regular shape. The author does not make this clear.
A reader looking for the drama of memorable fusion experiments will be disappointed. A high point, for example, was the night of Dec. 9, 1993, when the Princeton reactor delighted an audience of luminaries by delivering a record pulse of three million watts of fusion power. Fowler mentions the achievement but does not convey the electric thrill experienced by onlookers when that surge of power registered on computer monitors. This interesting, flawed book suggests that sometimes a scientist should seek help from a professional writer to organize his presentation.

 ALTERED STATES
 The United States and Japan
 Since the Occupation.
 By Michael Schaller.

 AMERICAN foreign policy is going through a noble phase just at the moment. In Eastern Europe, the United States is erasing the divisions of the cold war, bestowing NATO's security upon grateful Czechs, Poles and Hungarians. In the Middle East, it is rededicating itself to the peace process, a task so thankless that a saintly glow illuminates anyone fool enough to undertake it. In the Balkans, America is the scourge of war criminals; in Myanmar, it denounces human wrongs. But foreign policy is not always like this. Look at America's Japan policy.
America's dealings with Japan have seldom been about human rights or justice or peace mediation. They have been about profits and guns. In 1851 Japan was minding its own business when President Millard Fillmore wrote the Emperor a letter demanding that the two countries commence trade; since then, the American clamor for access to Japan's markets has continued unabated. In the early 1940's, after commercial rivalry in continental Asia got out of hand, the two nations fought a horrendous war; at other times, their armies have lined up on the same side. Warm or hostile, the United States-Japan relationship has been driven by calculations of raw power. Principle was just about irrelevant.
This is how the Japanese wanted it. When Japan was forced out of isolation by Fillmore's letter, Asia was being carved up by colonists spouting fine principles from the decks of their gunboats. Japan resolved to escape principled subjugation by amassing commercial and military power, and by shutting its ears to foreigners' beguiling rhetoric. As a result, Japan has traded with America only when it stood to gain; it has never believed (until recently, at least) that a consistent commitment to free trade is good on principle. Equally, Japan has entered security alliances with America only on terms that suited its narrow interests. It has been indifferent (again, until recently) to abstractions like human rights and international justice.
Japan's determined Realpolitik, and America's response, lie at the heart of two scholarly new books on the bilateral relationship. In "The Clash," Walter LaFeber, a diplomatic historian at Cornell University, takes the story back to the 1850's. Michael Schaller, a professor of history at the University of Arizona, deals with the period after 1945 in "Altered States." Both offer dense chronological accounts that are not for the fainthearted. Both draw few general lessons from their research, which may disappoint nonspecialist readers. Nevertheless, both books suggest that today's noble phase in foreign policy may soon bump up against its limits.
The noble foreign policy is based on two ideas: that America has the power to force other countries to behave in a principled way, and that its power allows it to take its core security for granted. The history of Japan policy shows that both assumptions are dangerous. Even at times when America boasted overwhelming power vis-a-vis Japan, it has not been able to make its principles stick. And, despite American power, Japan has often behaved in ways that threatened American security.
Consider first America's failure to make Japan accept its principles. For 150 years, as LaFeber shows, America has preached the value of free trade; for 150 years Japan has listened only when convenient. In the late 19th century, Japan was weak, so it backed America's "open door" policy on Chinese trade and grabbed the commercial opportunities that this policy created. In the early 20th century, Japan was strong, so it reversed its attitude to the open door and seized a chunk of China for its own companies. After 1945, America continued to explain that free trade yields benefits for everyone. Japan pretended to listen.
Japan, LaFeber tells us, has defied the United States on more than just trade. In 1904 Japan took advantage of American diplomatic support to go to war against Russia. This did not prevent Japan from entering into an alliance with Russia in 1910 to thwart American policy in China. After World War I, the United States emerged as the most powerful nation on earth: its industry had escaped destruction, its Navy was building formidable new ships, foreigners (including the Japanese) depended on New York for capital. But at the Versailles conference Japan steadfastly refused to bend to Woodrow Wilson's request that it should give up some territorial gains. "Wilson found himself now controlling the world's greatest economic and military power," LaFeber writes, "but it was not enough to have his way with Japan."
After World War II, this pattern continued. America's relative power increased; its military bases in Japan protected the Japanese from Communism. But this did not stop the Japanese from defying America repeatedly, refusing to rearm as rapidly as Washington wanted, demanding that the southern island of Okinawa be returned, undermining the American boycott of China after the Tiananmen massacre. Japanese leftists wanted the alliance revoked; when, in 1960, America's Ambassador in Tokyo met Japan's Foreign Minister to exchange signed copies of the security pact, arrangements had to be made for the two to escape over a back wall if rioting mobs caught up with them. Even the pro-American right wing has doubted the security alliance. In 1972, according to a poll cited by Schaller, only 44 percent of Liberal Democrat candidates for the Diet supported it strongly.
The high point of American power over Japan came right after 1945, when America's occupation force thought it could remake Japan in its own image. As a biographer of Douglas MacArthur, the general who reigned over occupied Japan, Schaller is especially expert on this folly. The United States started out by purging militarists from public life, hoping that new leaders would sprout up who shared American principles. When the vacuum seemed likelier to be filled by a pro-Communist left wing, Washington changed course. Nearly 200,000 Japanese had their purge orders revoked; these ex-militarists accounted for 42 percent of the new members of the Diet's lower house after the 1952 election. In 1957, Nobusuke Kishi, who had cosigned the declaration of war against the United States in 1941 and been imprisoned for war crimes, visited America as Japan's Prime Minister and Eisenhower's guest. Schaller mentions that he was invited to throw out the first ball at a game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox.
This visit was humiliating; but it teaches a useful lesson about the limits to American power, and so the limits to its ability to pursue principled foreign policy. On principle, America should have punished war criminals. But it simply could not afford the risk that Japan might acquire weak or Communist leadership. On principle, today, America is right to push Japan to open its markets and shoulder more of the defense burden in Asia. But perhaps it cannot afford to risk a Japanese backlash -- just as it must beware of provoking Southeast Asians when it speaks up for human rights and Russians when it enlarges NATO. It is not a pleasant thing to say, but noble ideals can sometimes be a poor guide to foreign policy.

THE BEAST REAWAKENS
 By Martin A. Lee.
 Illustrated. 546 pp. Boston:
 Little, Brown & Company.
 $24.95. 
 FOR several decades following the end of the Third Reich, extreme right-wing political movements around the world had to camouflage their true colors. "Fascists had no choice but to maintain a low profile," Martin A. Lee says in "The Beast Reawakens," because the Nazi horror delivered "state terror, genocide and mass destruction on an unprecedented scale."
Lee, a journalist who has written for several publications, has good reason to introduce his account of present-day fascism by recalling the fate of prominent Nazis who avoided serious punishment after the war and went on to successful careers in international intrigue and the arms trade. For several decades, their true vocation was to serve as living links to Hitler himself, inspiring young neo-Nazis in Germany and elsewhere.
Nazi apologists also sustained the cause. Most Americans are unfamiliar with people like Willis Carto. But Lee reminds us how Carto's Liberty Lobby and his magazine, Spotlight, forged links with the Republican Party in the 1960's, gaining a measure of legitimacy (and not inconsiderable funds) for Carto's promotional efforts among American and European neo-Nazis.
The underground culture that veteran Nazis and Nazi apologists helped to nurture did not reach genuinely dangerous proportions until the late 1980's, when developments like the end of the cold war made a number of European countries vulnerable to fascist appeals. Germany served as an unhelpful bellwether. During the immediate postwar period, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer appointed well-known former Nazis to high-ranking positions. By 1991, as skinheads and other domestic neo-Nazis grew more brazen, staging outright pogroms against immigrant and refugee families, Chancellor Helmut Kohl refused to respond with the kind of urgent measures that his Government had enacted against extreme leftists. German justice appeared to be blind in the right eye.
Lee provides a vivid survey of fascist resurgence throughout Europe. In Italy, Romania, France and Austria, demagogic political leaders have tried to divert "economic and social resentments toward national and racial preoccupations." In Croatia, President Franjo Tudjman has based much of his electoral appeal on rehabilitating his country's Nazi-allied wartime Government. To do so, he has whitewashed the slaughter of Orthodox Serbs and Jews, a kind of double holocaust that extreme Croatian nationalists now claim did not occur. Even in Russia, where, one might expect, the ravages of World War II would make it impossible for explicitly fascist rhetoric to gain a foothold, there are politicians and newspapers prepared to glorify Hitler, while fascist supporters can be found hawking swastika buttons within yards of Red Square.
The United States is not immune to this virus. Lee finds evidence that at least some leaders of the militia movement have links to neo-Nazis. Their mistrust of government authority may lack a well-defined political orientation, fascist or otherwise, but in a broad survey of fascism today, Lee would be remiss not to underscore the fact that many militia members and even a few candidates for high office are prepared to glorify violence and exploit irrational fears about foreigners, two elements of fascism's appeal that are not unfamiliar on the American political landscape.
Several decades ago, the German philosopher Theodor Adorno regarded the continued existence of fascism "within democracy" as "more threatening than the continued existence of fascist tendencies against democracy." Adorno's cautionary observation underscores a principal theme of "The Beast Reawakens." Although fascism requires political and economic instability in order to make serious gains, alert fascists can always be relied on to exploit the failure of democratic leaders to defend democratic values without apology.

ALL AROUND ATLANTIS
 Stories.
 By Deborah Eisenberg.
 244 pp. New York:
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23. 
 IN his preface to "What Maisie Knew," Henry James reminds us that "small children have many more perceptions than they have terms to translate them; their vision is at any moment much richer, their apprehension even constantly stronger, than . . . their at all producible vocabulary." In other words, their feelings can be complex even when their language is not. The writer, James was suggesting, might by a certain sleight of hand grant fictional children a language that honors these intuitions, this inner life. (This strategy is also attractive because it enacts the children's helplessness while returning to them their dignity.)
No contemporary American fiction has demonstrated James's suggestion more powerfully than Deborah Eisenberg's, beginning with her first story collection, "Transactions in a Foreign Currency" -- particularly the gorgeous and heartbreaking "What It Was Like, Seeing Chris" -- and continuing with her newest, "All Around Atlantis." In some of her most memorable stories the protagonists are adolescent or preadolescent -- "fine and shy and anxious with the passion that precedes knowledge," to return to James for a moment -- almost always affluent and always neglected.
As in the case of Kyla, the protagonist of "Mermaids," a story of nearly unremitting sadness about a miserable spring-vacation trip to New York City, these children are repeatedly shunted aside and left to wait for adults who remain fixed with an iron graciousness in their own agendas and who choose to assume that privilege will redress emotional isolation. Kyla lives in a world of expectations, admonitions and exhortations, a world that believes in the relative immutability of adults, even as its children are open to scrutiny, correction and evaluation. Eisenberg is expert on the cruelty of such expectations. (Kyla's friend Janey, when Kyla is offered some ice cream, requests some as well. Her mother responds: "There's some fruit for you. Remember those five pounds.")
These children are expected -- usually by their mothers -- to maintain a certain independence. ("Kyla leaned against her mother's coolness. 'Don't cling, darling,' her mother said. 'You're getting much too big.' ") Their mothers have an unfortunate gift for "the automatic nuancing of the unspoken," leaving the children in sole possession of a terrible silence. These women are ciphers, the decoding of which offers the children their only hope of decoding themselves: "Her mother's bed was tightly made; the bedspread was as mute as the surface of a lake into which a clue had been dropped long before"; "In the mirror . . . her mother's eyes lay across her own reflection like a mask." Like James, Eisenberg uses children to make seemingly ignoble people worthy of our attention; like Maisie, by the play of their good faith, these children make their parents "concrete, immense and awful."
The children in Eisenberg's stories only occasionally reveal the gaps in their precociousness. "Kyla looked at her. Flirting. Flirting, actually, was when you . . . 'What was he doing?' she asked." In these stories, comedy often operates that way: the precociously complex followed by the resoundingly down-to-earth. Francie, the main character in "The Girl Who Left Her Sock on the Floor," notes that "when her mother and Mrs. Peck emerged from the office together that afternoon, a blaze of triumph and contempt crackled behind the veneer of patently suspect humility on her mother's face. Mrs. Peck, on the other hand, looked as if she'd been bonked on the head with a plank."
The tension between vocabulary and perception creates in Eisenberg's young people a kind of uncanny eloquence of the nearly articulate: "When people got angry, they were angry and then they stopped being angry, and it was something that went from them to you. But when people were disappointed in you, it was something that went from you to them." Thus the children puzzle through larger philosophical understandings ("Just think," Francie muses, "things that you did went on and on, turning into situations, for example. Into people.") while perceiving events with a lyricism apparently charged with an emotional meaning that needs to be teased out. Visiting her mother's room after her death, Francie notices that "a fine coating of city grime sealed the sills in front of the closed windows like insulation."
Whether born to economic privilege, like Kyla, or selected for it, like Francie, the scholarship girl trapped in a snooty boarding school, these characters are always aware of class issues. Francie, remembering that her mother was often described as "proud," bristles: "But what did that mean, 'proud'? Proud of her poverty. Proud of her poor education. . . . Proud of bringing up her Difficult Daughter, Without an Iota of Help. So what was the difference, when you got right down to it, between pride and shame?"
"What you can do if something belongs to you!" another character realizes. "The way you can behave!" Three of the seven stories widen the collection's political scope and make the ramifications of class international by plunking down well-meaning and well-off Americans in Latin America and then probing their national collective shame as tourists "on the brink of doing or thinking something unworthy." In "Tlaloc's Paradise," for example, a refugee from the McCarthy purges, waiting in a Mexican village for her husband to return from a battery of medical tests in America, catches a glimpse of a local history she'd overlooked -- a history of refugees, disappearances and secret wars.
In "Someone to Talk To," an aging pianist, in an attempt to recapture a bit of the old adulation, agrees to perform in a concert sponsored by a murderous regime that supports the arts to divert international attention from its other activities. And in "Across the Lake," a college student gives himself over to two slightly feral Americans of the sort who turn up regularly in Robert Stone's fiction. Not surprisingly, he finds himself in the kind of deep water that Stone's guilty innocents have a genius for discovering. Drug runners, revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries trade the subtlest lethal gestures as our hero, Rob, frets over whether one of his fellow travelers has noticed his infatuation with her.
While Rob, in trying to make sense of this new world, like Stone's or Malcolm Lowry's hapless adventurers, follows "a trail of instructions . . . as far as it was possible to go," the reader comes to apprehend some of the complexity of his -- and our -- relationship to such places ("He could buy or not buy; he could exercise his power and money or refrain from doing so, and that was the extent of his choice") as well as the complexity of their relationship to us: "The shop owner was a large woman. Some automatic function was releasing rage evenly into her face." All the stories, featuring their protagonists' previously untested integrity and convenient innocence, maintain as their subtext willfully overlooked suffering.
The title story works the most explicitly to demonstrate the indivisibility of the personal and the political. Middle-aged Anna, on the death of her mother, Lili, imagines what she might say now to Peter, who was a boarder with the family when she was a child. Lili's entire circle, including Peter, were refugees from one Hungarian catastrophe after another, but poor Anna didn't qualify, having been brought to America as an infant. Competing with a long-lost and idealized past of which she'd had no part -- the lost city of the title -- as well as discovering herself to be in a half-understood sexual competition with her mother for Peter's attention, she was left an emigre in her own home.
Not all the strategies that recur in Eisenberg's stories are endlessly pleasing. Occasionally, the noticed detail is too flatfootedly an objective correlative (as Francie starts to face her shattered life without her newly deceased mother, "out the window a wrecking ball swung toward a solitary wall") and there's a fondness for pointedly illuminating chance encounters with eccentrics, who through their ramblings focus the stories' themes while bringing the usually somewhat baffled protagonists up to speed.
But if Deborah Eisenberg's young people, like Francie, are forced to train themselves in matters of empathy without the help of any obvious mentors, we as readers reap the benefits of their hard work: these stories are spirited and masterly road maps through sad and forbidding and desolate terrain.

HEADLINE: ART;
Public Sculpture the Public Likes. Really.

BYLINE: By ROBIN CEMBALEST; Robin Cembalest is the arts editor of the Forward.

 BODY:
IN 1995, WHEN THE SCULPTOR Tom Otterness was asked to create an artwork for a plaza outside the Sacramento Federal Courthouse, he had an inspiration: a four-foot-tall chess set that reflected the drama of the proceedings unfolding inside. In his first proposal, he envisioned one side as the financial establishment -- rooks as banks, bishops as lawyers, king and queen as rich entrepreneurs. The other would be an army of working-class pawns bearing shovels, mallets and serving trays.
Bronze casts of those pieces are in Mr. Otterness's show that opens Thursday for a monthlong run at the Marlborough Gallery on West 57th Street, where he moved from a SoHo gallery last year. But the works never made it to the plaza. A community panel convened by the General Services Administration, the Federal agency that commissioned Mr. Otterness, deemed the idea inappropriate and asked him to try again, a normal part of the back-and-forth nature of public projects. 
 The plaza, which opens next spring, now has a very different configuration: a tableau depicting the history of Sacramento, with salmon, gold miners, a covered wagon and scenes from the building of the railroad.
Though the final result bears no resemblance to his original design, Mr. Otterness is philosophical. "I said, 'What do you want?' " he recounts. "They said, 'Eagles.' I thought, 'Here's a chance to do a series of vignettes of Western culture.' I look at it positively."
That willingness to compromise is one reason Mr. Otterness is one of the country's busiest public sculptors. Nearly every work in the Marlborough show was generated by a public project. There are the canine prosecutor and feline defendant (telltale feather in its mouth) completed last May at the United States Courthouse in Portland, Ore. An alligator chomping off a man's head belongs to "Life Underground," a series of more than 20 bronzes that will be installed in December at the subway station on Eighth Avenue and 14th Street in Manhattan. A "frog rock" and other anthropomorphic stone characters are adapted from a piece for the United States Courthouse in Minneapolis, scheduled for next year.
With the debacle of Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc" still alive in the memory of the committees that commission public art, Mr. Otterness's frolicking figures offer everything that monolithic abstract sculpture lacks: humor, narrative, tactility, accessibility and an obvious, yet unthreatening, artistic sophistication.
"There's public art that I like, there's public art my son likes, but this is something we both like," says Tom Finkelpearl, a former director of New York City's percent-for-art program. "That it could exist for a 4-year-old and an adult expert is something Tom's acutely aware of."
Mr. Finkelpearl describes Mr. Otterness's elaborate vignettes as a contemporary version of church frescoes that spun complex allegories for an illiterate public. Others have likened his chubby cast of characters to the Pillsbury Doughboy, Babar the Elephant, James Thurber's cartoons, Disney animations and Holbein's portraits; his narrative style to Delacroix's history painting, Chinese tomb sculpture and Roman friezes; his sense of the absurd to Kafka.
IT TAKES A MOMENT OF LOOKING at Mr. Otterness's work to realize just how dark its content can be. His creatures may be adorable, but they are also greedy, cunning and destructive, engaged in life-or-death dramas in which the small and meek often emerge as losers. In "The Tables," a 1987 piece owned by the Whitney Museum of American Art, scores of tiny figures course through a city threatened by an atomic bomb shaped like a whale, a gargantuan spider and a cracked world hanging overhead.
"The Disney thing is the window into the work," says the artist, a mild-mannered man of 45 with below-the-shoulder graying blond hair and a goatee. "Disney has this nightmarish quality that I am convinced is its attraction -- the underpinnings of dysfunction and turmoil."
While many successful public artists work almost exclusively in the civic arena, Mr. Otterness is one of the few, among them Vito Acconci and Siah Armajani, who have a strong presence in the gallery and museum world as well.
According to Adam Weinberg, a curator at the Whitney, "Otterness engages a lot of the issues of current contemporary art -- popular culture, the pitfalls of capitalism, the downfall of communism, sexual politics. But he is really sui generis. There are not many artists I can relate him to."
Mr. Otterness plays down the political implications of his art, preferring to emphasize its personal approach to economic issues. "Instead of looking at this social system we're in from a great distance, I'm looking from inside my family out," says the artist, who has a wife and a 5-year-old daughter. "From the point of view of one of those figures looking up at one of those ominous forces."
Besides, he notes, what may seem heavy-handed to some may appeal to others. That was the case when the art museum in his hometown, Wichita, Kan., invited him to build a piece for its lawn and he offered an enlarged detail from "The Tables": a 15-foot-tall woman with a sickle standing over a fallen man with a hammer. "We were prepared for the worst," says Inez Wolins, the museum's director. But when the sculpture was installed in 1995, "Not a single person complained."
GROWING UP IN KANSAS, where his father worked for Boeing and his mother worked as a waitress and sold real estate, Mr. Otterness had no doubts about his calling. "I used to tell my teachers I didn't need to know how to spell because I was going to be an artist," he says. He proved himself right when he won a scholarship to attend the Art Students League and at 19 he found himself in New York. To support his studies, he catalogued pre-Columbian collections at the Museum of Natural History, where the Aztec and Mayan pieces exerted great power on him. "They had a beautiful formal quality combined with horrific decapitations and sacrifices," he says.
Mr. Otterness joined the Lower East Side artists who in 1977 founded Collaborative Projects, aspiring to take art out of galleries into mainstream settings like Times Square. In 1980, he provoked a small scandal when it emerged that he had made a film of a dog being shot, a seemingly uncharacteristic gesture that he has since declined to discuss.
Mr. Otterness has refined the characters he started working with in the late 70's, though he still uses five wax prototypes: a nude, a blue-collar worker, a white-collar worker, a police officer and a generic rich person. In his 9,000-square-foot Brooklyn studio under the Manhattan Bridge, as many as 12 assistants help him churn out his public projects.
The figures have gradually increased in size -- his largest so far is the 30-foot-tall "Uberfrau" outside the state library in Munster, Germany -- and he wants to make them bigger still. "I'd like to have figures that function as architecture," he says. "I'm trying to get into Las Vegas to do a theme park." Another ambition is to move into animation and toys.
Meanwhile, he is juggling the details of his public projects: his "Visionary," a 17-foot-tall woman holding her detached head in her hands, will be installed by the Public Art Fund at the Metrotech Center in downtown Brooklyn next month; he is finishing gates for the garden of the Cleveland Public Library. At the request of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, he recently removed a "rat cop" from "Life Underground," which is on view in Battery Park City until its installation in the subway.
"My philosophy is try to yield to every request so that the work can survive and end up in public," he says. "Then an active debate can happen."

HEADLINE: Can the Man Who Made Sun City Make It In Atlantic City?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Rabinovitz; Jonathan Rabinovitz is a reporter in Hartford for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Sol (the Sun King) Kerzner was casino hopping.
His casinos. Wednesday found him at his beachfront resort in the Bahamas, where card sharks watch real sharks in what Kerzner claims is the world's largest open-air aquarium. Thursday he turned up in Atlantic City to plan a $150 million overhaul of Resorts Casino Hotel, his newest toy. And Friday his jet landed in Connecticut for a party at Mohegan Sun, a stadium-size gambling palace that he built last year on the Mohegan Indian reservation. 
 Although Kerzner's name is little known in this country, one of the resorts that he built in his native South Africa -- Sun City -- was notorious. In the 80's, it inspired a hit anti-apartheid song and a boycott by superstars like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. Kerzner, who is sometimes called the Bugsy Siegel of the bush veld, was accused of bribery and was roundly denounced for using apartheid to advance his business interests. And time and again, when someone has stood in his way -- a politician or investigator or regulator -- that person has wound up with a comfortable job or a stake in the company or tax revenues he can't refuse.
Over the last three years, though, as chairman of Sun International Hotels, Kerzner has presided over the rise of one of the hottest gambling companies in the United States, its market value increasing fourfold since 1995 to about $1.2 billion earlier this month. With his casinos in Connecticut, the Bahamas and, if he has his way, Atlantic City, Kerzner is giving people like Steve Wynn and Donald Trump a run for their money, and Sun has a shot at becoming the dominant gaming company serving the East Coast.
Because of his and his company's cloudy history, Federal regulators initially balked at approving Kerzner's deal with the Mohegans. New Jersey gaming regulators have just completed the latest investigation of his dealings as part of the review of his application to operate in Atlantic City, and hearings are scheduled to begin tomorrow. Kerzner and industry observers are upbeat about his prospects.
The Friday-night party at Mohegan Sun offered a glimpse of why anyone trying to stop the Kerzner juggernaut has his work cut out for him. Clouds scudded across the ceiling, and there was the sound of a rushing stream. We were surrounded by trees, cliffs and boulders typical of a New England forest. "It's very Mohegan," Kerzner said. Even louder than the stream was the clanging of nearly 3,000 slot machines.
As hundreds of Mohegans in tuxedos, ball gowns and buckskin danced to an R & B band, the tribe's chief, Ralph Sturges, greeted Kerzner like a brother, giving him a hug. Roland Harris, the tribal council chairman, called him a "good friend." A letter was read from Gov. John G. Rowland -- who had once opposed Kerzner -- hailing the casino as an economic shot in the arm for the region. Senator Christopher Dodd made a speech, recalling some "very, very dicey times" but ultimately recounting "the pleasure" of working with Kerzner, who looked positively stunned by the praise. "What an outstanding guy," Kerzner said. "Incredible!"
Perhaps the most incredible thing of all is how respectable Sol Kerzner has become. Apartheid has ended, and he is on good terms with President Nelson Mandela. Liberal Democrats and Indians, who would once have been outraged by his South African past, are his allies. And Mohegan Sun, the nation's fifth-most-spacious casino, rakes in a million dollars a day.
An old friend, Lynton Israel, describes Kerzner as a "party animal." For his 50th birthday, the mogul chartered a 747 for more than 100 friends, with showgirls doing stripteases in the aisle. But now, 12 years later, he insists that he has mellowed.
Kerzner looks like a truck driver and has worked as a bouncer. He wears a construction helmet more often than a tie. He went years without reading a novel, does not like Champagne and at a Chinese restaurant at Mohegan Sun sent back his soup because the noodles kept slipping off his spoon. It is only his well-groomed hands that hint at his station. "I have lover's hands," says Kerzner, who is engaged to a 35-year-old model after three marriages, two of which ended in divorce and one of which ended in his wife's suicide.
Paul M. Dworin, publisher of International Gaming and Wagering Business magazine, calls him a "visionary" who should not be underestimated. "He's unpolished," Dworin says, "but unpolished by choice."
On a winter afternoon in the Bahamas, where Kerzner is adding a 23-story hotel to his Atlantis resort, he walked a vacant 30-acre lot in his usual jeans, polo shirt and scuffed Reeboks. "It looks like a big sandbox," he said. "Come back here in six weeks and the structure will be flying." By Christmas 1998, he added, the site, which is loosely based on the theme of Plato's fabled Lost City of Atlantis, will feature a gold-leaf domed palace, a Mayan temple with water slides and Kerzner's version of Atlantis ruins.
Later that day, he sat in a construction trailer, jiggling the worry beads that he has carried since 1983, when he suffered a heart attack and quit his three-pack-a-day cigarette habit. Poring over a restaurant blueprint, he suddenly frowned. "You can't walk into this room with the ass end of the bar out," he growled, gesturing at a design in which the bar blocked the restaurant entry. He told a construction executive to call the designers. "That plan is hopeless," he shouted into the phone, and ordered them to fix it.
The designs of Sun casinos are not driven by Kerzner's creative whims as much as his understanding of gaming trends. Kerzner couldn't tell you much about Mohegan history or Atlantis mythology. Like his Las Vegas counterparts, he once marketed his casinos as racy adult playgrounds. But now, reflecting his own transition from a jet-setting party animal to a doting grandfather, he has become a leader in the current industry trend: casino resorts as purveyors of wholesome, environmentally correct family entertainment.
Casinos are now legal in 26 states, up from 2 a decade ago. In 1995, according to one survey, American casinos had more visits than amusement parks, touring Broadway shows or major-league baseball games. With more gamblers but also with more casinos competing for their money, the operators need to offer more to lure people. Besides a splashy, if not altogether consistent, theme, the Bahamas Atlantis offers basic classes in blackjack, roulette and craps. Executives say that even though only 1 out of 5 Atlantis guests lists gambling as a reason for the visit, 9 out of 10 end up betting.
Kerzner clearly knows how to build these populist Xanadus. The Lost City, a 1992 addition to Sun City that was his first project to use the theme of a vanished ancient civilization, has been described as a surfer's paradise in the arid interior of South Africa, with an imported jungle of more than one million plants, a manmade ocean of six-foot waves and its own mythology (written by the resort's California architect). Herbert Muschamp, the architecture critic for The Times, called the Mohegan Sun's interior, which was created by the designer of the Planet Hollywood restaurants, "as ambitious a piece of stagecraft as anyone has realized since the days of Cecil B. DeMille." For the Atlantic City Resorts Casino, which Kerzner bought from Merv Griffin late last year, Kerzner plans the Beach Club, which will evoke the Boardwalk hotels of the turn of the century -- the ones that were gutted to make way for casinos like his own.
While Las Vegas has become a haven for Disneylike attractions, Atlantic City has lagged behind. Civic boosters see Kerzner as part of a group of developers who will recast the town as a destination resort. Gaming-industry analysts point to his success in turning around the Bahamas casino, another failing Resorts property that Griffin had owned.
"Is this the Atlantis Plato envisioned when he wrote of a utopian vision?" intones a promotional video for the $460 million addition that's now under way there. The footage shows young women in bathing suits playing in the water. Kerzner has flown in "disease resistant" palm trees and stocked an artificial coral reef with 13,000 tropical fish from as far away as Australia. New slot machines have motifs like "Shakin' Shark" and "Crazy Crab."
"Obviously this new development takes on a lot of Plato's thinking," Kerzner says.
Has he read Plato?
"I get summarized versions."
Born on Aug. 23, 1935, Solomon Kerzner was the youngest son of Orthodox Jewish parents who immigrated to South Africa from a shtetl in Eastern Europe. He grew up in a poor Johannesburg suburb, and his parents worked seven days a week in their own cafe. As a college boxer, he occasionally faced better fighters, but no one knocked him out, and he was welterweight champion at his school.
By age 28, having quit his job in accounting, he managed to sweet-talk some of his former clients into financing his plan to build a luxury hotel, even though he had never built anything. Before construction started, he spent two days touring hotels in Miami Beach and a day in Manhattan. The Beverly Hills Hotel, South Africa's first five-star resort, opened in December 1964.
From this start, Kerzner teamed up in 1969 with one of South Africa's largest companies to develop a chain of 29 hotels. Fourteen years later, he joined with new partners to establish another company that soon had a virtual monopoly on the casino market in South Africa, where headlines still refer to him simply as Sol. He brought Frank Sinatra to Africa and married and divorced one of the country's most famous women, a former Miss World. He has estates on the Riviera, on a mountaintop near Cape Town and outside Oxford, England. One report valued his family trusts at $750 million in 1994.
Kerzner would not have achieved this success without apartheid. All of his casinos were built in the homelands -- desolate reservations where black people were herded, which the apartheid regime began spinning off as independent states in 1976. Every other country refused to recognize these puppet states, and the African National Congress urged businesses to stay out of them. Kerzner rushed in.
Casinos were banned in South Africa but not in the quasi-independent homelands. He built Sun City on barren land in Bophuthatswana, two hours by car from Johannesburg. As part of the deal, Kerzner gave the homeland a substantial stake in the company that controlled the casino. The resort -- sometimes called Las Vegas on the veld, sometimes called Sin City -- drew white South Africans to gamble, ogle topless dancers and maybe have interracial sex, all of which were illegal in South Africa.
"Sol Kerzner was an unforgettable and important brick in the wall of apartheid," says Randall Robinson, president of the Washington-based lobbying group Trans Africa. "He and what he was doing were an essential part of the Government's strategy to defend that awful system."
Sun City became a symbol of apartheid's evils. In 1985, it was a target of the American anti-apartheid movement, with more than 50 musicians producing the album "Sun City." The title cut's chorus, "I ain't gonna play Sun City," urged performers to stay away.
Today, while Kerzner calls apartheid "unacceptable," he says that he was a businessman, not a politician. "Your role as a chief executive is to take care of your shareholders," he says. "We did what we could. That was very, very little."
Apartheid has been a defining issue in Kerzner's business life, partly because it allowed him to vastly expand his fortune and partly because his controversial way of doing so has dogged him ever since. His attempt to profit from the homelands backfired, for example, in the Transkei. For the past 10 years, he has been in and out of trouble over a charge that he paid a $600,000 bribe to a leader of the homeland, since deposed, to guarantee his monopoly in that market. Kerzner acknowledges the payment but considers it extortion. South African prosecutors finally dropped the case in April; New Jersey investigators have carefully studied it.
The connection to apartheid initially hindered Kerzner's efforts to expand beyond South Africa. But in the 1990's, when the country underwent radical change, so did his fortunes. By the time Mandela emerged from prison after 27 years, Kerzner had cultivated good relations with his African National Congress -- too good, said some critics, who cite reports that Kerzner wined and dined A.N.C. officials, that he covered some wedding costs for one of Mandela's daughters and that he helped pay for a 50th-birthday party for Mandela's heir apparent, Thabo Mbeki. Kerzner denies these reports, but he admits to contributing roughly $125,000 to the A.N.C. in 1994 -- a charge that he initially told journalists was "outrageously false."
President Mandela appears to harbor no ill will toward Kerzner for his apartheid-era profiteering. Before Kerzner was welcomed into the Bahamas, Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham talked to Mandela about him. "He felt Mr. Kerzner would be good for the Bahamas," Ingraham says, "and he didn't think there were any reasons whatsoever why the Bahamas ought not welcome him to do business here."
Yet each time Kerzner undertakes an ambitious new project, the same criticisms crop up. Two years ago, it was in Washington. Trading Cove Associates, a partnership in which Kerzner's company has a 50 percent stake, had a contract with the Mohegans to build and run the casino that required the approval of the National Indian Gaming Commission. The Federal agency had a backlog of cases, but the Mohegan contract -- the largest deal that had ever come before the commission -- received priority handling. Senator Dodd's office made several calls to the agency urging it to hurry up. "All we wanted them to do was make a decision," Dodd says. "It had gone on for a long time."
When two of the three commissioners recommended against approval until further review of Kerzner, the third commissioner, the chairman, Harold Monteau, overruled his colleagues. Monteau argued, in an unusual but legal move, that the Mohegans had waited long enough -- two years -- and that the law did not require a more thorough review. One year later, the Mohegans hired Monteau's assistant, Tom Acevedo, and an aide to Senator Dodd, Charles F. Bunnell, as chief and deputy chief of staff, respectively, for the Mohegan tribal chairman.
"This doesn't even pass the smell test," Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said of Acevedo's hiring when he spoke in October before the Committee on Indian Affairs. Reid also questioned why the casino's management company receives as much as 40 percent of the gaming profits -- about 10 percent above the norm. Three months later, Monteau, under fire for this and other problems, resigned from the gaming commission, saying he wanted to work outside government. Kerzner says he wasn't involved in the commission's review or in the Mohegans' hiring of any employees, including Acevedo.
In Connecticut, Kerzner's arrival also caused a stir. At first Governor Rowland voiced "grave concerns" about giving a state casino license to someone plagued by bribery allegations. But in July 1996, after the Connecticut state police conducted an investigation, Kerzner received a license. Less than a year later, the Mohegans had hired two of the state investigators to work for the tribe's own gaming commission.
Kerzner has offered as evidence of his integrity a 1994 report compiled by a private investigator for the tribe. Francis M. Mullen, a retired F.B.I. official and former head of the Drug Enforcement Agency, interviewed Derek Hawton, a South African business colleague of Kerzner's. The report noted that according to Hawton, "President Mandela himself has stated to him that 'Sol Kerzner would be prosecuted over my dead body.' " In March, the morning after I faxed this quote to Mandela's office for confirmation, a frantic Kerzner called. He had already spoken to Mullen, who after completing the report became the Mohegans' top regulator. "Somehow this got fouled up," Kerzner told me, adding that Mullen had made a mistake that caused "huge bloody problems." According to Kerzner, Mullen had meant to write that Hawton had "heard" that President Mandela had made this remark. Kerzner insisted that the quote should not be reprinted. The next day, Mullen said that the report was most likely in error, though he was not sure. Mandela's office denied that he made the statement.
The allegations of influence peddling are very much alive in New Jersey, where state regulators are currently considering Kerzner's application for the Atlantic City casino license. The review is the most comprehensive that he and his company have yet undergone, its scope unprecedented even by New Jersey gaming standards.
And the Atlantic City project carries considerable business risk. For the first time, Kerzner may be going head to head with some of the casino industry's biggest players, among them Donald Trump, who owns 3 of the 12 casinos in Atlantic City but whose company's market value was one-third of Kerzner's earlier this month, and Steve Wynn, whose Mirage Resorts had a market value roughly four times greater than Sun's in the same period. Kerzner has already scaled back his plans from a half billion dollars to $150 million, though he says he is bullish on Atlantic City. People who blocked his entry in 1983 are now talking about the jobs he will bring. "The name of the game is not to oppose," said Pierre Hollingsworth, the former head of the Atlantic City N.A.A.C.P. chapter, who protested Kerzner's proposal years ago. "He's going to be bringing work." Several people familiar with Atlantic City regulations say they will be shocked if Kerzner, who has an army of supporters ready to attest to his good character, is not licensed by the end of the year.
That is why many people are betting that Kerzner is here to stay. Since Mohegan Sun opened in October, it has brought in at least $325 million in gaming revenues. More than $58 million of that went to Governor Rowland and the Connecticut budget as part of a deal that gives the state 25 percent of the casino's slot-machine revenues. Another cut of casino profits went to the Wall Street investors who put up the construction money. Several thousand people have jobs because of the casino, and when Senator Dodd campaigns for re-election he will undoubtedly remind them that his support of Mohegan Sun helped make those jobs possible.
While the blots on Kerzner's record are unsightly, no one has ever proved them to be illegal. People may mistake his crudeness for shadiness, even as Kerzner is so consumed with his chase for profits that he ignores appearances. And with every coin dropped into a slot machine, it becomes clearer and clearer why it would be so difficult for any government or regulatory agency or Wall Street banking house to turn him away. Sol Kerzner knows how to make money.

HEADLINE: Getting Opal Caples to Work

 BODY:
True, every capable person should work, but the problems lie in the system's inability to place underskilled workers in an increasingly high-tech economy. 
 Nonetheless, the stereotypes in the article were highly offensive, beginning with the cover depicting three white males tirelessly working to stop welfare, and Opal Caples with her three children as the poster queen for welfare. Not only is welfare less than 3 percent of the national budget, but whites constitute a majority of the United States' welfare cases.
Welfare is not a black woman's issue, nor is it the greatest strain on American taxpayers' pockets.

HEADLINE: Helping Women With World of Finances

BYLINE: By RAHEL MUSLEAH 

 BODY:
TO Marilyn Crockett and Diane Terman Felenstein shopping for stocks is not much different from shopping for clothes and groceries. They liken bond ratings to pantyhose sizes and the buying of stocks in downturns to buying tuna fish on sale.
Their mission, to demystify money for women, has earned them reputations as the Ann Landers and Dear Abby of women's finances. 
 Ms. Crockett and Ms. Terman Felenstein founded the 008-Investment Club, an organization for women that meets in Manhattan. They share their story in "The Money Club: How We Taught Ourselves the Secret to a Secure Financial Future -- and How You Can, Too," written with Dale Burg (Simon & Schuster).
"Money is on the dark side of the moon for women," said Ms. Crockett, first vice president of investments at Paine Webber. "It's an unexplored frontier."
Ms. Crockett was invited to serve as the club's financial adviser by Ms. Terman Felenstein, who formed the club after being inspired by an article about the Beardstown Ladies, 16 women from Illinois who wrote a best-seller about their investment club.
Although Ms. Terman-Felenestein presided over a public relations and marketing company with clients like Prestige Cosmetics, Slim Fast and United Cerebral Palsy, she said she considered personal finances, even her own, to be "the world's most boring topic." At meetings with accountants and insurance agents, she said, she "zoned out and doodled."
When she contacted friends, successful professionals and businesswomen, fund-raisers and spouses of top executives, many with houses on Long Island, she found that few knew more than she did about managing their money. That cemented her resolve to form an investment club.
Ms. Terman Felenstein, 56, has now taken charge of her own stock portfolio, reorganized her insurance and estate plans, and even requested and received financial newsletters as birthday presents.
The 008-Club, so named because eight is a "power number" connoting financial success in numerology, lived up to its inspiration. Its portfolio has gained 29 percent a year since it began in June 1995. Its membership has grown, from 18 to 39 women. The group charges $1,100 as an entrance fee and $115 monthly for investments and expenses.
The club is one of 31,800 investment clubs worldwide, according to the National Association of Investors Corporations, headquartered in Michigan. Sixty percent of the 500,463 members of the clubs are female, and the average return on investments is 12 percent, according to the association.
Although the association was founded in 1951, most of its growth has been in the last three years, a spokesman said. Statistics in "The Money Club" show that all-female investment clubs in the United States account for 41 percent of the total clubs and that they outperform all-male clubs -- 13 percent -- by a 3-to-1 margin.
Ms. Crockett, who also advises a men's investment club in Manhattan, Stocks and Bondage, said she noticed a more competitive environment there, in contrast to the supportive atmosphere at the 008-Club.
She added that women were better investors than men, because they took time to understand each stock instead of making quick decisions and "shooting from the hip."
Most investment clubs are simple partnership agreements that have average portfolios of $87,000.
The 008-Club educates members through reports, speakers and seminars. In addition to Ms. Crockett, a financial consultant always attends the 7:30 A.M. meetings in Ms. Crockett's office.
No coffee, no doughnuts. No question is stupid.
"The single biggest mistake women make about money is that they're afraid to find out what it's all about," Ms. Terman Felenstein said. "They don't understand it. Money means another responsibility. There isn't enough time to do everything. So it becomes something to get to tomorrow.
"Women should be more afraid of the consequences. Ignoring your financial safety can lead to disaster. Learn the language. Assess what you have. Don't sign papers unless you know what they are. One small thing could change your life. Be honest about asking for help."
Women also fear taking risks, added Ms. Crockett, who learned about risk when as a college student she performed in an acrobatic show with the Florida State Flying High Circus.
"When you fear making a mistake," the book advises, "the most obvious tactic is to make no decision at all. But if you're not on the field you can never be a winner."
Chapters on investments, retirement and estate planning, insurance and transitions like marriage and divorce offer strategies for beginners.
To illustrate the message that women have to protect themselves the book is peppered with "horror stories" like the following:
*Harriet Mosson, 54, president of Liz Claiborne Dresses, was left destitute when her husband died unexpectedly and his former wife was still the beneficiary of his life-insurance policy.
*The 48-year-old owner of a dry-cleaning business gave her husband power of attorney when they were selling a former business. Ten years later, on the verge of separating, she came home after a vacation to find that her husband had used the power of attorney to sell the house that they owned jointly.
*A 39-year-old textile designer placed an order to buy stock for "a thousand" -- meaning dollars -- and was charged $12,000 for 1,000 shares.
"The message of the book is that it could be you," Ms. Terman Felenstein said.
Ms. Crockett, 49, who majored in college in home economics, said she got her wakeup call nine years ago while she was a flight attendant at Pan American World Airways. The company went out of business, and almost simultaneously, an 18-year relationship ended.
Ms. Crockett realized that she had assumed that her boyfriend would assure her financial security. When she examined her pension, she found it provided only $100 a month after she turned 62.
With no money, no job and no financial experience, she decided to capitalize on her fascination with business. In her years as a flight attendant in the first-class section, she had become hooked on business magazines and began investing "as a lark."
She applied for a position at a Wall Street brokerage, was accepted, and brought in more business than anyone else in the six-month training class that year.
"When a personal crisis touches you, the words you hear about financial security suddenly become poignant," said Jane Bishop Shalam of Old Westbury, executive vice president of the club. "You need that jolt."
Ms. Shalam works with many cultural organizations and is married to John Shalam, founder and chief executive officer of Audiovox, which imports sound equipment for cars and specializes in cellular phones. She grew up in Kings Point, the only daughter in a family of four children.
Her father had a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, she said, but did not teach her much about money.
"The family looked at me as a princess," Ms. Shalam recalled. "Today, I'm the person today who's managed the entire family with self-taught skills. The club has been my tool."
Five years ago, her sister-in-law died in a car accident in Indonesia. Her brother and their 7-year-old, Naomi, were seriously injured, Ms. Shalam recounted. But he had not paid his insurance a few weeks earlier and was left without coverage.
"I needed a lot of money fast to take care of the family," Ms. Shalam said. "It cost me $28,000 to get them out of a jungle hospital. Had I been on my own I wonder where my resources would have come from. It made me realize I had to be more knowledgeable about what I did and didn't have."
She spent two months in Indonesia, brought her brother back to the United States and has been raising the girl for four years, along with her own three sons.
Ms. Shalam took a hands-on approach to the responsibility each club member had -- researching and reporting on companies. When she was working on Home Depot, she spent a day going down the aisles of a store. When she reported on a hearing-aid company, she tried out all its products.
The women stressed that their first goal was to learn, not to make money. But their new-found knowledge has transformed their interests.
"I used to talk about buying Armani clothes and going to the theater," the president of the club, Joann Jordan, said. "Now instead of recommending the latest movie to people I ask how their stock portfolio is doing. I've become somewhat of an evangelist. As a widow I can't tell you how confident I feel that I'm the master of my own finances."
Ms. Jordan, a real-estate broker with houses in Manhattan and East Hampton, said she acquired more financial sophistication than many other women early on as she watched her father lose money because "he didn't pay attention."
When her husband died a year ago, the club was both a nurturing environment and a diversion, she said.
The club inspired Enid Rosenthal, a friend of Ms. Terman Felenstein, to form a women's investment club on Long Island, the Millennium Club.
That organization has capped its membership at 30, said Ms. Rosenthal, who lives in Old Westbury. The group meets monthly at restaurants and has been surpassing the Dow Jones Industrial Average every month.
For Carol Safir, a real estate broker and the wife of the New York City Police Commissioner, membership in the 008-Club meant that she felt equipped to manage a pension fund from her husband's former consulting business. She initially divided the fund four ways, allotting three parts to three brokers and controlling one part herself.
"After three years," Ms. Safir said, "I produced the best results. I created my own mutual fund, and it grew 35 percent. Now I will probably consolidate it and manage it all myself."
The Safirs have homes in Manhattan and Southhold. One important outcome of Ms. Safir's involvement in money matters is that her children, Jennifer, 26, an agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Adam, 24, a lawyer, have begun creating their own investment strategies.
"Mothers give advice," Ms. Safir said. "But children learn by example."

Penn Planning to Build Hotel and a Commercial Hub

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
NEARLY 30 years after its last major construction project added dormitories, the student bookstore and a new research center, the University of Pennsylvania is in the midst of two major building and renovation projects that will again reshape its campus.
One of them, called Sansom Common, will include in its first phase a 250-room hotel, shops and a new bookstore at an estimated cost of $73 million. The site is at the heart of the campus on a block bounded by Walnut, Sansom, 36th and 37th Streets that for years has been a two-acre parking lot. 
 The second phase will include the creation a new north-south street linking the hotel entrance to Chestnut Street, a major artery leading to downtown Philadelphia.
University officials are now considering proposals for the the block between Sansom and Chestnut Streets to add town houses and retail space and renovate existing high-rise dormitories and add retail space. The total budget for Sansom Common is $120 million.
The other project, Perelman Quadrangle, consists of $62 million in improvements to 19th-century academic buildings and pathways and lawns between them near the corner of 34th and Spruce Streets. The area will include a plaza or amphitheater area that will be used for gatherings.
"These projects will shape Penn as a residential community, particularly for undergraduates," said Judith Rodin, who became president of the university in 1993.
They also are significant in a wider urban context. The university, in West Philadelphia a mile west of downtown, is the city's largest private employer, with more than 25,000 workers at its campus and hospital. It is in an area where 72 percent of the residents are black and 20 percent are below the Federal poverty level, according to the Philadelphia City Planning Commission.
There are other educational institutions in the area, known as University City, including Drexel University, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science and a satellite campus of Lincoln University.
The 260-acre Penn campus has only one street with a significant number of privately owned stores, said Judy Wicks, who has run the White Dog Cafe and Black Cat gift shop for 25 years. Along Sansom Street, one block east of Sansom Common, there are about two dozen brick buildings with restaurants, cafes, pubs and an international newsstand. "It's important that the university have a commercial hub in the middle of the campus," Ms. Wicks said.
Planners say the first phase of Sansom Common will move the university in that direction. The cost of the hotel -- The Inn at Penn -- and the 55,000-square-foot bookstore and other stores -- will be paid for through long-term contracts or leases with their operators. The hotel operator has yet to be designated.
DR. RODIN, the university's president, predicted that the project would create the atmosphere of a European village with residences, shops, theaters and galleries. "It will give us the chance to re-animate Walnut Street, where there's more that goes on at night," she said.
The university spent $15 million last year to acquire the University City Sheraton Hotel for use as temporary living quarters while dormitory renovations are under way.
The bookstore at Sansom Common, a Barnes & Noble operation scheduled to open in the fall of 1998, will have a cafe and a children's activity area. Once the Barnes & Noble store opens, the 50,000-square-foot campus bookstore at 38th Street and Locust Walk and several nearby stores may be demolished, possibly to be replaced by a 300,000-square-foot building to be used by the Wharton School, Penn's business and management institution.
The 6-story, 190,000-square-foot hotel is scheduled to open in the fall of 1999, according to construction plans by LaSalle Partners of Chicago, the university's development manager. The hotel and bookstore have been designed by Elkus/Manfredi Architects Ltd. of Boston.
"The project itself has flown," said John A. Fry, the executive vice president at Penn, who is Sansom Common's project director. "We've gone from feasibility to construction in less than 12 months."
Retailers have been eager to reach the 22,000 students and thousands of people who work nearby, Mr. Fry said. But despite strong demand for stores, there are few sites on which to build more. The university's for-profit real estate company, UCA Realty Group, has built retail space on Walnut Street since 1987, usually with offices or parking above. UCA Realty owns and operates more than 70 properties in West Philadelphia, 40 of them residential.
Until recently, colleges and universities viewed their campuses as islands separate from their host communities, but that attitude is changing, said Gregory Clement, principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates in New York, which has worked on projects for Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and Baruch College in New York City.
"Penn's integration in that area has never been as clearly demarcated as at Columbia or Harvard," Mr. Clement said. "The fabric of Penn's campus really blends into the community and vice versa. It feels like it's part of the community, rather than a gated facility where you feel you need a card to get in."
CITING the need to work with the community, university officials note that Sansom Common will create 200 full-time jobs at the hotel and stores. The school already directs a portion of its equipment purchases and hiring to local sources, Mr. Fry said.
In the late 60's, Penn's last major construction project produced high-rise apartment towers in stark contrast to the local community's rowhouses. Local civic leaders say the university is now mindful of esthetic, economic and social concerns in developing its projects. To encourage such town-gown cooperation, the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has made grants to colleges and universities that create partnerships in their communities to solve local problems. Penn received a $400,000 grant last year.
One key liaison with the community is Ira Harkavy, an associate vice president at Penn who is director of the Center for Community Partnerships. The center coordinates the university's involvement in West Philadelphia. In 1969, when Mr. Harkavy was a junior at the university, he led a protest against the school's construction of dormitories and research facilities that replaced existing houses.
A study by Mr. Harkavy's department found that 8 of the nation's 20 largest cities -- Indianapolis, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego, Washington, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Columbus, Ohio -- all have a college, university or medical facilities as their largest private employers.
"Universities in the 1960's tried building barriers, but they also created distrust, hostility and affected the education of students who were part of the urban campus," he said. "Universities should make contributions to improve the quality of life in that environment. But they have not made optimal use of their locality as a place for students and teachers to address one of the most pressing issues of the day -- solving the problems of the American city."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Richard B. Erickson;
For Government on a Regional Footing

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
SINCE 1961, Richard B. Erickson has been involved in regional planning issues in Connecticut. That was the year Mr. Erickson, a county planner in New Jersey, became executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Regional Planning Agency, which became the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments in 1991.
Mr. Erickson is a native of Massachusetts, and earned degrees in geography at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. His career came about pretty much by accident. He had just gotten out of the Army as a Sergeant First Class in military intelligence when a friend mentioned a job in planning. Mr. Erickson thought it would be a good use of his geography skills, and took a job at the Cape May Planning Board in 1958. 
 Mr. Erickson, 65, recently informed his board of directors that he would retire in January, but was prevailed on to stay for another year. During an interview at his office on Boswell Avenue in Norwich recently, he reflected on his four decades as an advocate of regional planning, most of it in a state where there is a strong tradition of independent municipalities. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. What kind of changes have you seen in Connecticut?
A. There's been in certain instances a greater willingness to use regional service organizations, such as the regional water authority, regional transit districts, solid waste authorities, tourism district.
There has not been an abandonment, in any sense, of the philosophy of home rule. That's still quite strong. But I think it's been tempered by the changes taking place, almost overwhelming -- that there has to be a coming together of the local communities.
But we're light years away from any sort of regional organization that would bring together, in one agency, the governmental powers now scattered around.
Q. Would that be preferable, to have all these regional authorities under one office?
A. In theory, yes. In practice, at this point, I would say no. I don't think it could be achieved, to begin with. Secondly, I think if it were imposed by state fiat, it would be disastrous. The only way you can establish regional programs, in a state like Connecticut with a long history of home rule, is on a cooperative basis where partners are stepping to the table willingly.
Q. Does the state make regionalism more difficult with laws like that requiring more than 60 percent of municipalities in an area to approve the creation of a council of governments?
A. The advantage of the rule is that it insures you have a core of communities, more than half of the municipalities in a region, that have by their own choice opted to participate in the program. Anything less raises the question of how much of a base of support you have.
In the case of the formation of the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, there was an effort in 1980, which was a total failure, and another in 1990, which was a total failure. On the third try, in less than nine months, we had all the municipalities signed up.
Q. What changed?
A. There was the announcement of the impending cuts at Electric Boat. It was only after we took a hard look at the region's economic future that we were able to convince the towns that now was the time to proceed.
Q. So it was a crisis that prompted the creation of the council?
A. Oh, yes. In fact the creation of almost all the major regional organizations is linked to a crisis. That was true for the water authority (the severe droughts in the late 1960's), for the solid waste authority (the towns were overwhelmed). Southeast Area Transit was created when the Arab oil embargoes were imposed in the mid-1970's.
Q. Does the same hold true for the rest of the state?
A. Yeah. Connecticut is not a hotbed of regionalism.
Q. Why is that?
A. This is a state that did away with county governments in the late 1950's, and has great emphasis on having governmental decisions made as close as possible to the affected population. The related factor is the high dependence of the towns on the property tax. That creates an environment in which it is very understandable for the towns to be very self-focused.
And I think to a degree it's the nature of people in New England. Municipalities were formed first, and I think there has always been a degree of suspicion of our neighbors in New England -- and I can say that as a native New Englander.
Q. Where has regionalism worked?
A. The far West. Oregon, for example, has very strong regional legislation, as does the state of Washington. Minnesota has been very progressive. In New England, Vermont is probably the most advanced. They've put teeth, for example, into state and regional review of local land use decisions and planning, which is not available to us here in Connecticut. In the case of the Six Flags amusement park proposal, in Vermont, there would have by law been both a regional and state review.
Q. What kind of services are best provided on a regional basis?
A. Traditionally infrastructure, because infrastructure is typically needed irrespective of municipal boundaries. Economic development is another area. Land use management is an area which, if we continue to depend heavily on local property tax, should remain under local control, but my personal view is there's a need for a broadened, at least advisory review at the regional level.
One other area that I think will emerge over the next few years is the management of human service programs.
Q. Are there any services that really require municipal control?
A. In almost every instance there are going to be elements that will need to be performed at the local level. The degree of that will vary depending on the type of service and the size and complexity of the municipality.
For instance, comparing the city of New London with rural Voluntown, you're talking about a different environment in terms of the need for service and the resources available locally. The smaller towns, particularly, might be the primary beneficiaries of a regional program to supplement their local services.
Some regions in the country provide a circuit-riding town manager. We provide a technical assistance program to local planning and zoning and wetlands agencies. That's used periodically even by the largest towns, and we have a regular relationship with some smaller towns.
Q. Can larger towns can benefit from regionalism?
A. They can use the regional programs to supplement their local staffing in technical areas when a workload peaks or a special project arises.
Q. Are there any disadvantages to regionalism?
A. The biggest disadvantage right now is pulling together everyone who has to participate. We have 20 member municipalities, and most of the chief elected officials are up for election every two years. Two years ago we had a 55 percent turnover in the organization. This year, we're going to have at least a 35 percent turnover. That means every couple of years, you have to begin almost anew to develop an understanding on the part of the board of directors about what their function is and what the organization does. Most important, they have to develop working relationships and a level of trust with each other and with the staff of the council. That's a challenge. It makes it difficult to make sure you have continuity. But there's nothing much we can do to change that except to realize this is a critically important characteristic of councils of government, and we need to provide as much support as possible to members.
Q. New London County, with a population of 250,000, has a wide range of towns, from the affluent rural Stonington to an almost inner city area in New London and Norwich. Would regional government sort of smooth out those differences?
A. I think the most that can be expected from a regional structure is a balancing of the interests of those municipalities. There is nothing that would create a homogenized region, and it would create a pretty boring region if you could get that. I certainly am not going to advocate for that.
Many of these differences are the result of historic events in the settlement and gradual development of the towns. Realistically, those differences are going to continue, and may be highlighted and accentuated in the years ahead.

HEADLINE: Women Leaving Medicine for Home

BYLINE: By DARICE BAILER 

 BODY:
WHEN Dr. Ruth Martin graduated from the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in 1981, she was proud to be one of 49 women in a class of 148. In 1970 there had been only 13 women in the school's freshman class of 127. In the 1960's there had been only three or four women in each class.
Dr. Martin, whose training was in psychiatry, said she was pleased not to be an old-fashioned housewife; she was embarking on a career in what had been a predominantly male profession. 
 But eight years ago the Greenwich resident became a member of a new minority: women leaving medicine. Dr. Martin didn't leave because she was frustrated by trying to satisfy the demands of managed care or because practicing medicine was not as lucrative as it once was. She left, she said, because she suddenly realized that she wanted to stay home with her first child more than she ever thought she would.
Before her daughter Helena was born, Dr. Martin said, medicine had been her whole life. After the birth, the doctor found herself "frantic to get home" to see her baby. She was discovering that there was something equally, if not more, important to her than her medical practice. "I had to face the fact that I was a mother and I wanted to be with my child," Dr. Martin said.
Dr. Martin said she considered working part-time. But, she said, "I was burned out. My heart just wasn't in it."
The Martin family wasn't dependent on Dr. Martin's salary; her husband, Raymond Martin, is president and an owner of Solomon Broadcasting International in Stamford and can support the family, which has grown to three children, on his income.
Dr. Martin's situation is an exception to the rule. In 1995, according to the Census Bureau, the median income for married couples with children under age 18 and an unemployed spouse is $35,181.
Linda W. Finnie, a marriage and family therapist with offices in Greenwich and Wilton, says "I support women having choices, and yet we know that all women can't choose because of socioeconomic issues." Mrs. Finnie noted that women who are doctors have spent many years in the educational system training for their careers before choosing to give priority to raising their children. "It's wonderful that they have the possibility or the option to do that," she said. "It would be wonderful if all women had that choice."
Dr. Martin, 44, is glad that it is financially possible for her to stay home with Helena, now 9, her son Criswell, 3, and her daughter Meredith, 1. Mr. Martin travels a great deal, and Dr. Martin believes there is a calmness in her house that would not be there if she were working as well.
Five years ago, Dr. Randi R. Diamond, 38, quit her job as director of the geriatrics program at Norwalk Hospital to become a two-day-a-week attending physician at the Jewish Home for the Elderly in Fairfield. Dr. Diamond, who is married to an internist, Dr. Howard Eison, is home-schooling their children -- Daniel, 11, and Kaile, 9 -- in Weston. Feasible or not, the choice wasn't easy. "It was the hardest decision I ever made," Dr. Diamond said. "There are not a lot of people who have stepped back and said 'I need to limit my professional involvement to have more time with my family.' "
Jeanine Freliech, 32, is a part-time pediatrician at Doctors Pediatrics in Wilton. Dr. Freliech is the mother of Lydia, 2, and Cecily, 6 months. For now, Dr. Freliech said, "it's the best of both worlds." She works two days a week, doing what she was trained to do, and has five days home with her daughters.
Dr. Patricia Horton, 45, of Wilton, and Dr. Elizabeth (Lisa) Antell, 35, of Greenwich have also put their medical careers on hold.
Dr. Horton quit pediatrics after 15 years to stay home with her children, Whitney, who is now 16, and Andrew, 12.
Dr. Antell graduated from Cornell University Medical College after the birth of her first child, but did not continue with her training. She is married to Dr. Darrick Antell, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan; the two have three children.
Jeff Roames, director of student services at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Services, says he has seen doctors drop out of medicine during his 22 years at the university. Mr. Roames said what he's noticed recently "a change in attitude not only for the female students, but also for the male." Medicine is no longer the single focus of student lives, but one of many focuses. "It's fitting medicine into a complete life style," Mr. Roames said.
When a male physician quits medicine, however, it's usually because he's frustrated dealing with managed care or is unhappy by the constraints on doctors' incomes. It's not to devote more time to his family.
Is it acceptable for female physicians to put family first? "I would imagine that there are many doctors, both male and female, who would be very angry at them," said a male physician in private practice in Norwalk, who would speak on this sensitive issue only on condition of anonymity. He said he did not see anything wrong with women's decisions to leave medicine. "If they want to do it, and that's their choice, then they should do it," he said. "There are certainly people who go through hell to maintain their practice and raise their children. It's really hard."
But what about all the money spent training these doctors, only to have them leave? Medical students are heavily subsidized by their universities. While law schools and business schools generally make money for universities, medical schools are a drain.
Mr. Roames of George Washington says "Tuition cannot even come close to covering the cost of medical education." There are 3,000 faculty members to pay, and building costs. "We are running in the red," he said.
Dr. Horton -- who noted that she's been criticized for wasting resources and a spot in UConn's medical school despite having worked for 15 years -- worked for the student health service at Brown University before resigning in 1992 to move to Tokyo with her family. (Her husband, Rick Horton, is with IBM.)
Dr. Horton loved her job at Brown, but she had never traveled abroad before. The idea was very tempting. Still, she said, "I was dragged kicking and screaming."
Then she discovered that she enjoyed being a full-time mother, being able as she put it to go on field trips, help out in the classroom or attend impromptu school coffees or presentations. Dr. Horton recalled her daughter asking, "Can you come to school and do this?" "The answer was always no." Dr. Horton said. "She would have had to let me know three months in advance to get out of my schedule at the office."
The Horton family moved from Tokyo to Wilton a year ago, but Dr. Horton hasn't returned to work. She knows she has only a few years left with her children before they leave for college, and she says she wants to be around. She's planning on going back to work one day, though.

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Daniel A. Biederman;
The Greening of Downtown Districts

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
IF midtown Manhattan is a bit safer and a lot cleaner, there are those who think Daniel A. Biederman of Chappaqua deserves some of the credit. Mr. Biederman is president of the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership and executive director of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation. Together they make up the largest complex of private downtown management districts in the United States.
Mr. Biederman is what is called a downtown manager. As such, he works with city officials and property owners to raise money and maintain the acreage within his jurisdictions. For his work, specifically at Bryant Park, he was recently awarded the International Downtown Association's 1997 Special Achievement Award. 
 Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with him:
Q. What is a management district?
A. There are many cases in the United States where people with great economic stakes in neighborhood health have turned over a significant amount of responsibility outside their building to what is called a downtown manager. I'm the largest of those, because these districts cover about half the real estate in midtown Manhattan. This is done through a number of vehicles financially. Some are called tax-increment-financing districts; some are called business improvement districts; some are called downtown development corporations. Our combination covers the two main rail terminals of the city and Bryant Park.
Q. What do you do? Have you replaced the city government?
A. We work closely with the city, and it was under the impetus of the three mayors -- Koch, Dinkins and Giuliani -- that we started initially. Essentially, we manage jointly with the city the environment from building line to building line. Out on the sidewalks and in the streets and in the parks is a private entity that is spending a lot more money than government can afford to spend -- but spending it extremely wisely because it is being watched very closely by their board members.
Q. Where does your money come from?
A. Principally from assessments set on every building in the office district. If you're a commuter from Westchester with an office on a floor in a building near Grand Central Terminal, your landlord is paying about 15 cents per square foot for the services we provide that we think have remade the neighborhood in a much safer, much cleaner and more attractive way. There are some other revenues, particularly in Bryant Park, but the great bulk of the $20 million a year we have to spend on our districts comes from that assessment vehicle.
Q. At what point did those business owners vote to bring you in?
A. That happened in three different ways. In 1984, we established a district around Bryant Park to fix that park, which had tremendous problems. In 1988, such a decision was made at Grand Central and in 1992 at 34th Street, the area that includes Penn Station, the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden, Macy's and Herald Square.
Q. Describe what Bryant Park was like 15 to 20 years ago and what you did to change this.
A. The park had serious problems of design and the like and had declined significantly with active crime problems and vandals. It became unusable by people other than drug sellers. In fact, the number of people using the park declined to as few as 1,000 a day, whereas today we'll have 5,000 to 6,000 just at any one time at lunch. There was really no money in the city budget to hire enough police or park workers to clean it up. So the Rockefellers stepped in and hired me.
Q. So what did you do?
A. We redesigned the park and put in a terrific private security force and private maintenance. We put in various attractive amenities that involved food so there would be a reason for people to go to the park at off hours. We lit the park beautifully so it would be usable at night and to prevent vandalism, and we put in a phenomenally clean restroom right on 42d street so people would stop urinating in the park. We put in the best flower gardens, we think, anywhere in midtown Manhattan, and we put in interesting programs -- cultural, dance music, spoken word, a Monday-night movie series -- so there were other reasons to come into the park. And we put in 2,000 movable chairs.
Q. People have not been walking off with the chairs?
A. No. We lost fewer than 100 in 6 years to pilferage, whereas they usually just wear out. That's a key element. The park is jammed with people who like to sit on a chair -- choose their spot, in the gardens, wherever.
The tough thing about Bryant Park was it took nine years to execute the plan; five or six years were consumed with the process. We went through massive approvals to get the plan accepted.
Q. What about the Grand Central Partnership? What is that about?
A. That really came from a decision by Mobil Oil to leave the district and complain about it on their way out. They were leaving for Virginia and told Mayor Koch and his very smart Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Ken Lipper, that they were unhappy about conditions in the district. They made a videotape showing how terrible life in the Grand Central area was for their employees. The Mayor, through Ken Lipper, reached out to me and said, "Would you consider helping us with this because we want to fix this area up, and we don't have any money to do it?" Luckily, they also reached out to Peter Malkin, who is a Fairfield resident and became chairman, and I became the president of a new entity called Grand Central Partnership. Its aim was to apply some of the same private management techniques we were using in Bryant Park to the streets surrounding the terminal.
It has taken a few years, but in the early 90's we really started commanding the streets and installing attractive amenities and cleaning all the litter, removing the graffiti. And the crime rate, with a great help from the mayors, especially Giuliani, has been cut by 70 percent.
Q. What about the 34th Street Partnership?
A. That involved Peter Malkin, Bernard Mendik and me. A property owner said to us: "What you have done at Grand Central is so amazing. Do the same thing around Penn Station because we're dying down here." The litter was ankle deep in the terminal, and you had parks with a lot of crime and vandalism and dark, unattractive streets, a lot of clutter. After a massive effort, we now, in contrast, have competition from retailers who want to be in that district.
Q. All this begs the question: Why cannot the city do this? Is it too large to govern?
A. I think the Mayor has shown the city is not too big to be governed, that they can focus on individual block conditions. We started before Mayor Giuliani came in, when the city was in a worse fiscal condition and hadn't yet gotten to individual problems that were driving office workers and residents crazy. I think it's a combination of that and a combination of the use of our expertise. It sounds maybe overly proud, but I think we've developed a phenomenal team of experts on every area that needs to be worked on so a downtown can be well managed. And the city is organized differently by agencies, and they have many massive problems in other areas that they have to work on and greater responsibility.
Q. How does your security force interact with the police?
A. We call ourselves the eyes and ears of the police. We probably have more people out on the street on foot patrol than they do, but we don't have guns and we allow the police to actually make the arrest, although we may hold someone for an arrest. We work very closely with them.
Q. The Mayor has gotten a lot of attention for dealing with the so-called quality-of-life issues, but there is some concern that people are being arrested too aggressively. How do you see the balance?
A. I think what the Mayor has done is terrific. I think a lot of the criticism of the Mayor is purely political. I think anyone who has worked with the Police Department knows there were years in the 80's when the police were really disarmed. The police have now been unleashed to do their job -- not to abuse people. The cases of abuse are so few compared to the number of innocent lives saved from some character hanging around giving the police probable cause to believe a crime was going to be committed -- legal reason to search the guy.

For Rent: The Castle, $17,000 a Month, 28 or 35 Rms

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
OVER the last 18 months, eight prime houses in Greenwich have been rented for $15,000 to $25,000 a month in leases running for a year or more.
But there appears to be little comparable on the market in Fairfield County today -- with one exception -- a French neo-Renaissance chateau in Stamford, available for $17,000 a month. 
 Known as The Castle, the 15,000-square-foot cement-over-brick and steel residence has 28 to 35 rooms, depending on whether one counts as rooms the chauffeur's waiting room, the sewing room, darkroom, coatcheck room, pool changing room, and other limited-use spaces.
Built in 1912 at 1 Rogers Road on Shippan Point, the house sits on a rise with views of Long Island Sound across a courtyard, terraced lawns, specimen plantings and a 20- by 40-foot swimming pool. It is modeled after the Loire Valley chateaus.
Thomas L. Rich, who has an option to purchase the house, fell in love with it while accompanying a friend who was just looking. Mr. Rich is the 38-year-old senior vice president of the F. D. Rich Company, son of Robert Rich, the developer who rebuilt downtown Stamford.
He intends to live in the house some day, but in the meantime he is looking for a tenant seeking a lease of one to four years, and a buyer for a half-acre of the 1.67-acre property fronting on Rogers Road, priced at $500,000. Anyone living in the house is permitted four employees for a home-based business under Stamford zoning.
Mr. Richard's option to purchase expires next April 1, but it can be exercised on 60 days' notice or extended. "I might accept $15,000 a month," he said, adding that "for anyone paying the full $17,000 I will furnish the main living, dining and great hall areas."
The Castle, originally constructed for $140,000, has been on the market since September 1994. A price of $2.875 million was reduced to $2.75 million in 1996 and to $2.45 million in February of this year when Juner Properties of Stamford took over from a former broker. When it didn't sell through the summer it was reduced again, to $1.995 million. Neither June Rosenthal, owner of Juner Properties, nor Mr. Rich would disclose the price finally agreed upon.
"It's not a house for everyone," said Ms. Rosenthal, "but you couldn't duplicate it for many millions more, and you would have to bring craftsmen over from Europe." She said that taxes on the property were $29,500 a year and heating and cooling costs were about $11,000 a year.
The current co-owners and occupants for the last 19 years are Gordon Micunis and Jay Kobrin. After graduating from Yale they became partners in theatrical, fashion and interior design. After buying The Castle in 1978 they converted billiard and recreation rooms on the upper floors of the seven-level house into studios, using the main rooms as a showcase for their business and for numerous parties benefiting local charities.
Careful not to modernize the house, they have preserved original wrought-iron wall sconces and balustrades and a massive built-in oak icebox (supplemented by a 1920's double refrigerator) and restored broken stained glass and leaded windows.
They converted original gas-lighting fixtures to electricity, repaired the elevator and mined their professional access to European-styled wallpapers, fabrics, antique furniture and accessories and animal-head trophies, now in the great hall. "We do not hunt," Mr. Kobrin explained. "We bought them because they are suitable."
Still in use is the original kitchen incinerator, and in the paneled library there are original hand-held electric sconces attached to the bookcases by stretchable coils, the better to peer at book titles. The library contains the only fireplace in the house other than the walk-in fireplace in the great hall; its murals were painted in 1915 by Howard McCormick, muralist for the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan.
Central air-conditioning, steam and forced-air heating were installed or upgraded and an eight-burner restaurant gas stove replaced an outmoded range. Original marble over steel staircases, unblemished oak floors and slate roofing are all intact, as well as garden stepping stones of a thickness rarely seen today, chestnut kitchen cabinets, master bedroom wardrobes fitted with dozens of labeled drawers and an orchestrion that simulates 40 musical instruments.
In 1982 the house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in response to an application filed by the two owners.
The Castle was built by Frank J. Marion, who made a fortune producing one-reel films for nickelodeons and, as a colleague of Thomas Alva Edison, collaborated in various motion-picture inventions.
A man of expensive tastes backed by ample financial resources, he hired the Manhattan architectural firm of Richard Morris Hunt to design the house, which he named Terre Bonne. The firm also designed The Breakers in Newport, R.I., for Cornelius Vanderbilt and The Biltmore in Asheville, N.C., for George W. Vanderbilt, as well as several Fifth Avenue mansions.
The steel work was done by the American Bridge Company, builders of the Brooklyn Bridge. Wadley and Smythe, landscape architects, designed the Terre Bonne gardens, which extended to the water on what was then a four-and-a-half acre tract. When the waterfront parcel was sold off the owners of The Castle retained in perpetuity a right of way to the private beach and two boat moorings.
"When we took the house I was the same age as Marion was when he moved in," said Mr. Micunis. "I swore we would stay as long as he did, but I give up." He and Mr. Kobrin have bought a six-room apartment in Stamford and will spend more time at their sprawling adobe house in Santa Fe, N.M. Whatever furnishings were not moved to the two residences were disposed of in an auction at The Castle last weekend.
AFTER Frank J. Marion's death in 1963 at the age of 94, David and Martha Cogan bought what had come to be known as Marion Castle, using it as a summer home. Mr. Cogan was an inventor and major manufacturer of the color television tube. His wife was instrumental in rescuing dozens of children from the Nazis during World War II.
Thomas Rich will continue the succession of entertainment-oriented owners with his parallel careers of real estate developer and actor. He has had roles in five off-Broadway plays, 20 commercials, some low-budget films, and eight television shows, including a recent bit part in "Beverly Hills 90210." Because of his film work he keeps a home in Los Angeles, and when attending to real estate he lives in Stamford.
He is currently planning to develop a prime parcel of Stamford real estate opposite the new University of Connecticut branch nearing completion on Broad Street. The site could accommodate a 350,000-square-foot office building or a combination of offices and retailers.
"I'm not sure when I will move into The Castle," he said, "but I would like to settle down and raise a family there."

Tempo Picks Up on Warehouse-Distribution Projects

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WORK began Sept. 10 on transforming a patch of farmland not far from Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike into a 2 million-square-foot industrial park. Its first building will be constructed on speculation over the next nine months.
The initial high-ceilinged structure in the 150-acre Cranbury Business Park, which will be developed over four years on Cranbury-South River Road, will have 201,600 square feet of warehouse, distribution and office space. The entire project will be developed in two phases by Security Capital Industrial Trust of Aurora, Colo., one of the nation's largest industrial real estate investment trusts. 
 In addition to the first structure, phase one will include five more speculative buildings together totaling 1.26 million square feet of space; the second phase of up to 800,000 square feet will be in buildings for specific tenants. The project, which will cost more than $50 million, marks the company's first foray into new construction in the state. Since it entered New Jersey last year it has acquired 2.5 million square feet of industrial space in eight buildings.
The Cranbury Business Park venture is part of the latest wave of building activity in the Exit 8A region as developers try to capitalize on a strengthening industrial market and what they say is a demand for modern high-ceilinged warehouse distribution buildings.
Several other projects, together totaling an additional 2.7 million square feet of space, are being built or planned in Cranbury, Monroe and South Brunswick and Jamesburg Townships in Middlesex County. Its location -- midway between New York and Philadelphia via the turnpike and Routes 1 and 130, which also link it to points up and down the Eastern Seaboard -- makes it among the favored spots for such development.
Some buildings are being built on speculation, others are being planned as build-to-suit structures for specific users. And the activity has spread farther south to Exit 7A of the turnpike, where construction is under way on three build-to-suit buildings, with a total of 508,000 square feet, at the 553-acre Northeast Business Park in Washington Township. That site will ultimately have 2 million square feet of space.
Several factors are stoking the building activity in the area, as well as in other parts of the 11-county northern and central New Jersey market, industry executives said. Among them is the state's improving economy, which has translated into a demand for industrial buildings from some companies expanding within or into the state as well as others looking to consolidate operations from several locations into one.
Through June, 2.3 million square feet -- most of it warehouse and distribution space in greater-than 100,000-square-foot blocks -- was leased or sold in the region. That, along with limited building, reduced the supply of available space of that size to 2.1 million from 4.2 million in July 1996, and the vacancy rate to 6 percent from 10 percent. At $4.43 a square foot, average asking rents remain healthy, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage.
Because much of the available space is obsolete and capital has become available "the market in general and in 8A in particular is starting to see speculative construction," said Andrew J. Merin, executive director of the financial services group at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Merin said the presence of REITs (real estate investment trusts, which are publicly owned vehicles for purchasing and operating real estate) and pension and insurance companies in the marketplace provide ready financing for construction. And, he added, the cost of buying industrial buildings in prime locations like the Exit 8A area was close to or exceeded the cost of new construction.
"The question," said Mr. Merin, "is can the demand in the market sustain all the new development?"
FOR Security Capital, starting the Cranbury Business Park "made sense because there is limited opportunity to buy buildings and a selective need for new product to meet the needs of today's tenants," said Michael Nachamkin, a company vice president who runs its New Jersey operations, which are based in Edison.
The park is being built in a community where zoning has until recently restrained warehouse development and kept Cranbury from capturing its share of development during the mid-80's building boom. But a year and a half ago Cranbury Township rezoned some 1,200 acres east of Route l30, which bisects the community, to warehouse use from office and industrial use.
It did so, said Mayor Alan A. Danser of Cranbury, because there was a "need for ratable growth" to strenghten the township's commercial base and reduce the tax burden on its 2,500 residents.
Cranbury Business Park, made possible by the rezoning, is the first major commercial development in the township in 10 years. The project's initial 1.26 million square foot phase alone is expected to generate $400,000 to $500,000 in new tax revenue for the township, said Mayor Danser.
There are three other warehouse projects in various stages of approvals in the township that together would produce 1.3 million square feet of such space. Plans are moving forward on a fourth project that would mix 216,000 square feet of office space with 650,000 square feet of warehouse space in three buildings, according to data from the township's Planning Department.
Mr. Nachamkin said Security Capital was developing the Cranbury site "as much to create an identity for the company as to create a destination in the region."
The park's first 201,600-square-foot building, like its others, will have 32-foot-high ceilings and 3 to 5 percent of its space dedicated to office use. While rents have not yet been set, they will be competitive, said Mr. Nachamkin.
Elsewhere in the Exit 8A region the Matrix Development Group of Cranbury is developing with different partners two speculative warehouse distribution projects. One is a 259,369-square-foot building on a site along Matrix Drive within the 900-acre Center Point business park straddling Monroe and South Brunswick Townships. Matrix is developing the building (the steel skeleton is now half complete) with the Prudential Insurance Company based in Newark.
The other, a joint venture with AMB Realty Advisors in Boston, is the renovation and expansion of a 1950's warehouse on Dock's Corner Road in South Brunswick into a modern 1.2 million-square-foot building. The partners have demolished 100,000 square feet of the existing, mostly occupied, 650,000-square-foot building, and are now adding 650,000 square feet of new space.
"Even in the worst of times there was still activity in the 8A region and now demand for space is strong," said Joseph S. Taylor, Matrix's president and chief executive. Rents at both projects will be competitive, he added.
And after a slow start activity is also picking up in the market off Exit 7A of the turnpike, said Mr. Taylor. There, Matrix is developing the 2-million-square-foot Northeast Business Park in partnership with Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, an industrial and office REIT in Melville, L.I. Reckson is providing a $6 million mortgage secured by the park, where the focus will be on build-to-suit deals.
The two companies formed a joint-venture partnership last May to develop and buy industrial properties in New Jersey.
"We think tenants will come farther south to 7A and the park will capture its share of the market because of cheaper rents, equal access to the major Northeast transportation corridors, an excellent labor pool and stable taxes," said Mr. Taylor. "The 8A area does not have to be saturated before companies will leapfrog to 7A."
Some already have. Construction is under way on a 265,000-square-foot building for Hahn & DePalmer, a full-service marketing company; the Amway Corporation, a direct-mail company, and McLean Engineering have signed on for 113,306- and 130,000-square-foot buildings respectively, said Mr. Taylor. "There is a risk of saturation," he said of the amount of activity in the market. "But I don't see it right now."

HEADLINE: School Construction Gets State Aid Boost

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
ALBANY'S more generous approach to school aid in the 1997-98 budget, representing a $750 million increase for a total expenditure of $11 billion, has brought relief to many school district leaders who in recent years have grown accustomed to less.
One major change includes legislation that would insure that all school districts receive at least 10 percent reimbursement of construction costs on projects approved after July 1 next year. 
 This guaranteed minimum level of construction aid means that districts like Bedford, Elmsford, Harrison, Hendrick Hudson, Pocantico Hills and White Plains, which previously had not received any state aid for such projects, will now receive some state money. Districts that had previously received less than 10 percent in building aid, like Byram Hills, Greenburgh Central 7 and Irvington, will also benefit.
"I was involved in the statewide effort to get building aid for the 43 state districts that presently get zero building aid," said Dr. Ronald Valenti, the Harrison Superintendent. "Our position was that it was quite unfair and unjust for districts not to get a return on projects designed to make school buildings healthier and safer for students. Why shouldn't the state be a partner?"
Dr. Valenti continued: "New York State has found a considerable amount of money for education. That's the good news. The economy is doing extremely well, and we're able to address these issues in good faith. When you compare state aid of the last few years and now, this is a direction we must continue to move in. The Legislature has done a noble thing in addressing the infrastructure needs of school districts, and we'll continue the good fight."
Some districts have deferred school construction bond votes, which were planned for this school year, in response to the prospect of additional state funds for such projects next year.
In Dobbs Ferry, for example, the district's plan to hold a public referendum on borrowing $22 million to finance construction of new gymnasiums and classrooms has been postponed until next summer, Mary Cronin, the Deputy Superintendent said.
"When you're talking about a $22 million project, getting something in the range of $2 million back is significant," Ms. Cronin said. "Even though we'll hold off on the vote, if we have it July 1 and get our papers up to the state, we're hopeful we can start some work after January 1999 so that we can be ready by September 2000. We feel pretty confident that the Legislature wanted to aid school facilities."
Dobbs Ferry's proposed plan would include 14 new classrooms at the Springhurst Elementary School, among them replacing four temporary modular classrooms and adding classrooms and gymnasiums at the middle and high school campus.
The legislation is part of a package to upgrade school buildings, said Charles Szuberla, coordinator of facilities for the state's Department of Education.
"These are baby boomer buildings that were new 20 years ago," Mr. Szuberla said. "Many of these buildings date from the 50's, 60's and 70's and were designed to last for 30 years. The idea is, Let's align the facilities with the way we're teaching. Just look at how science was taught in the 1950's and 1960's, when teachers lectured from the front of the classroom. Now more hands-on science is being done, and science classrooms reflect that change."
Under this legislation, funds would be available for projects that would correct health or safety issues in a building, enhance accessibility for the disabled and improve educational technology and for related capital projects. The funds are not meant for routine maintenance or the renovation of existing space.
"The message is to get school buildings ready for the 21st century," Mr. Szuberla said. "There are a number of school districts in Westchester that are very affluent. For them, when they're getting zero building aid now, getting 10 percent will be a major improvement that's worth waiting for. We've been told by the Legislature that they have the money in there."
Still, in what some people view as a paradox, some districts are putting in temporary classrooms while waiting for voter approval next summer to begin permanent construction.
And some observers are concerned that if all the districts defer their construction bonds until next year, the reimbursements from Albany will be all but obliterated in higher construction costs, as too many districts chase too few approved contractors and architects.
"Our board has decided to move forward with a bond vote in early December," said Dr. Stanley Toll, Superintendent of the Ardsley school district. "Our reasoning is that we need the space now and that inflation will increase the cost of construction if we wait. Under the current thinking, very little construction will take place now, and a lot of construction would take place next year, which would drive up the bids. We're likely to get better prices if we go forward now."
Dr. Valenti said that "the Achilles heel of this legislation is that all these districts will be waiting for July 1998 when construction expenses will skyrocket, but we're looking to make it retroactive to January 1995 when many of these projects were started."

 BODY:

Jail Contract Renewed
The contract with EMSA Correctional Care, a private health care company, will be renewed only through next June 30 even though the county could have renewed it for a year, said Luke J. Smith, Deputy Commissioner of the County Corrections Department. 
 The company has been providing the county's 1,400 inmates with medical and mental health services since Jan. 1 last year. Its current contract, which runs through the end of this year, is for $10.1 million.
EMSA has come under scrutiny because of two inmate suicides at the County Jail in Valhalla, and it has been the subject of at least 20 lawsuits by prisoners. The most publicized case was the May 1996 suicide of Nancy Blumenthal, 17, of Bedford. She had been taken off antidepressants by a psychiatrist who worked for EMSA, even though the girl's parents had said she was suicidal.
In the other case, Sookhdeo (Frankie) Itwaru committed suicide in the jail in June, the night before he was to be sentenced.
EMSA, which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will be paid $2.66 million for the six months, a 5 percent increase in its current rate, Mr.Smith said.
"In light of the controversy surrounding EMSA, we wanted to continue to watch things, to keep them on a short leash," Mr. Smith said. "It's not that we are dissatisfied. If that were the case, we would not have renewed the contract at all."
Peekskill Ethics Case
In a five-page advisory opinion earlier this month, the Peekskill Board of Ethics found no impropriety in the sale of a downtown building by Edward Gibbs, the husband of Mayor Frances S. Gibbs, and three subsequent city loans of $85,000 to the buyer.
Mayor Gibbs, pleased with the finding of the Ethics Board but angry with earlier allegations of impropriety, said the ethics questions raised in the case were the result of "politically motivated false charges."
"Responsible, factual answers were ignored as the malicious character assassinations continued," she said. "I am gratified that an impartial Ethics Board, composed of members neither recommended nor voted on by me, has addressed the facts and drawn a clear conclusion that there was no validity to these false charges."
Early in the summer, Peekskill's Common Council appointed new members to the Ethics Board, which had been inactive, at the Mayor's request, so that it could consider the ethics charges.
In its report, the Ethics Board also said that Ralph DiBart, the city's consultant for downtown development, had not treated the Gibbs property "any differently than the other properties he marketed in the downtown."
The building was put up for sale in 1995 by Peekskill Properties, a company owned by Edward Gibbs -- who is chairman of the County Board of Ethics -- and his brother, George Gibbs. Mr. DiBart, as downtown consultant, showed the property to Kenneth Laudon, president of Azimuth Holdings, a software company, which bought it.
 
Scary Start to School
Emilys Zayas, 5, a Yonkers kindergartner who was tired after her first day of school, took a nap on the bus ride home, and unfortunately, no one noticed.
Although the story had a happy ending, the school bus driver who locked up the bus and left her sleeping on it has been dismissed along with the bus monitor who was employed by the school district.
Julio Cataldi, owner of Amberwood Coach Corporation of Yonkers, said the company dismissed the veteran bus driver, who had worked for the company for more than seven years, because he failed to check the bus after he finished his run.
Paul Del Colle, a spokesman for the school district, said that when Emilys's mother, Sonia Zayas, complained that her child had not arrived home from school, the Transportation Department called the bus company. But in what he called "a not-so-funny comedy of errors," the wrong bus was checked and no lost child was found.
The police finally found Emilys about 8 P.M. asleep under a seat on the bus after they had searched every bus in the yard, the spokesman said. She had been on the bus since at least 4:10 P.M.
At the end of each bus run, the driver is required to take any children still on the bus to the Board of Education central office on Palmer Road, Mr. Del Colle said. Last year, more than 3,000 children were taken to the central office for their parents to pick up.
 
Crime Tip Pays Off
A 15-year-old boy and two others have been indicted in the fatal robbery of a New Rochelle grocery store, the result of a telephone tip to District Attorney Jeanine Pirro's newly formed Westchester Crime Stoppers group.
William DeGaetano, 15, Andrew Thomas, 18, and Brian Howard, 24, were indicted in the case. The indictment charges that the defendants entered the C-Deli at 4 A.M. on May 23 and shot and killed Young Kwon Do, 34, who was working there. The defendants fled with the delicatessen's cash register after the shooting, the District Attorney's office said. They are charged with second-degree murder, robbery, criminal use of a firearm and criminal possession of a weapon.
Second-degree murder is punishable by a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in state prison. Because of William's age, he can be sentenced only to 9 years to life even though he is to be tried as an adult.
The informer was paid $5,000 for the tip that led to the arrests. The telephone number for Crime Stoppers is (800) 898-8477. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: Market Indicators: Multiple Bids, Unbound Binders, Frayed Tempers

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
IF the perils of Carol Joyner's quest through the rugged terrain of the residential real estate market -- pocked as it is by the pitfalls of multiple bidding and unrequited contracts -- were scripted for a silent movie, it would be a cliffhanger.
And the episodes might be titled: "High Hopes," "Naivete," "Avarice," "Betrayal," "Dashed Dreams" and -- not to give away the ending -- "The Denouement." 
 Ms. Joyner and her husband, Gerald, are among the thousands of would-be buyers who have been frustrated, even infuriated, by a sales market in which the search for the "right one" can last a year, contracts seem less than contractual, bidding wars boost prices beyond what was initially asked and even a winning bid can be cause for dismay.
"I've seen buyer's remorse after fiercely competitive bidding, whether they win or lose," said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, a leading Manhattan brokerage.
Before their search ended, the Joyners would see five bids rejected, three contracts left unsigned by a seller, three deposit checks uncashed and one vacation disrupted. "I guess we were a bit naive about all of this," Ms. Joyner said.
Multiple bids, outright bidding wars and sealed-bid auctions have been commonplace in the posher precincts of Manhattan for at least a year. But multiple bidding, that barometer of a pressurized market, has become increasingly evident in the other boroughs of the city and its surrounding suburbs in recent months, real estate brokers, lawyers and customers attest.
"The cursed multiple bidding," said Michael Ford, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, tongue only slightly in cheek. "We are seeing it here in Union, Middlesex, and my brokers in Bergen tell me its happening up there."
Ed Gitlin, a broker for Benjamin Realty, which has offices in Forest Hills, Queens, and Syosset, L.I., said, "It's not unusual that one house will have an accepted offer with two or three backup offers.
"I had an instance on a split-level, three-bedroom in North Syosset where an owner accepted an offer and it fell through," Mr. Gitlin said. "Then they accepted another offer as a backup and that fell through, and now they have another offer that they've accepted with two backups."
With the economy humming, conventional mortgage rates hovering in the attractive 7.7 percent range, an abundance of buyers, and computers giving brokers instant access to all the latest listings, multiple bidding is back.
But the phenomenon is more than a measure of demand; like a self-fulfilling prophecy, it is a spur to further demand. And so, with buyers virtually lining up (in one instance on Long Island actually waiting in the next room), sellers are holding off on signing contracts, even after their asking price has been met. Buyers are taking worrisome risks by dropping standard contract clauses -- like those that make the deal contingent on the results of an engineer's inspection, or even on the ability to secure a mortgage -- then feeling betrayed when a deal they thought was done collapses. And all the parties, even the brokers nursing clients through the process only to see commissions slip away, are being discombobulated.
None more so, perhaps, than the Joyners. The couple -- she a child-care agency director, he a union official -- had been subletting a one-bedroom co-op in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and began looking for a two-bedroom in a prewar building a year ago, about the time their 2-year-old daughter, Camara, began scaling the railing of her crib and crawling into her parents' bed most nights.
Hoping to remain near Prospect Park, they offered $200,000 for a three-bedroom on Plaza Street -- the circle around Grand Army Plaza -- only to be told the price had to be $250,000. Soon after, however, the seller called, Ms. Joyner said, and proposed that "if we exclude the broker and come up a bit, he'd reconsider."
The Joyners offered $230,000 -- through their broker. The bid was accepted, a contract was signed, "and then he said he didn't want to sell, they had a higher offer," Ms. Joyner said.
A few weeks later, the same seller called again and said the second bidder had withdrawn, "are we still interested?" Ms. Joyner said. "So we signed the contract again, sent the check again. And then he told us he got a cash offer from somebody else; he'd rather that."
And then the cash deal fell through.
"We're gluttons for punishment," Ms. Joyner said. "But the third time we weren't stupid enough to just sign the contract. We had our lawyer call before the contract was sent to confirm that they were serious, and their lawyer said he knew nothing about the deal. So my husband told the seller to go to hell. And that apartment is still vacant, a year later."
A glut of offers can obviously be a hair-puller for potential buyers. As Mr. Gitlin said, "They really are between the earth and the sky, not knowing whether they should go looking at other homes or just wait and see if the other deal falls through."
But it can "drive the sellers crazy, too," Mr. Gitlin said. "It's a nerve-racking experience. You have to baby-sit everybody, nurse them along."
And as Marilyn A. Donahue, president of a brokerage that bears her name and serves brownstone Brooklyn, put it: "We're trained to believe that an O. & A. -- that's offer and acceptance -- means something, but we're discovering that it doesn't always mean very much. Between an O. & A. and the contract, it's like running the gantlet for the last mile."
TAKE the case of Julius Kahn, a teacher, and Sheryl Kamil-Kahn, a cosmetics sales manager, both single parents of a total of five children until their wedding last month. The couple wanted to sell Mr. Kahn's home, a three-bedroom, split-level on Leahy Street in Jericho, L.I., for about $275,000.
"It became a multiple-bidding scene," Mr. Kahn said. "I had an offer for $280,000 that I accepted and signed a binder. Two days after that, I was offered $287,000."
Because he had signed a binder, Mr. Kahn could not accept the second offer. But after all the inspections and engineering reports had been completed, the first buyer began making more demands. "They wanted me to take out asbestos insulation around the pipes in the garage, to repair concrete around the house," Mr. Kahn said. "They wanted a second engineering inspection, but it would be after the terms of the binder expired." During those negotiations, the second buyer found another house.
After the binder expired, Mr. Kahn relisted his house, with a third and then a fourth buyer soon making offers. There came a night in June when Mr. Kahn was negotiating with one prospective purchaser in one room of his house while another waited in an adjoining room, and all the while the original procrastinator was still haggling.
"It was unbelievable," Mr. Kahn said. "It was difficult to sleep. I was very anxious because we had already purchased a home and I needed the sale of my house to consummate the purchase of the new house. It was difficult to tell my mortgage broker how much of a mortgage I required. And, as a result, the people from whom we purchased were getting anxious."
Eventually, the house on Leahy Street went to the third bidder, for $281,000.
"On top of getting married, packing up two houses and making the Brady Bunch, it's been a little hectic," said Mrs. Kamil-Kahn. At one point, she said, "We thought we would get a trailer and camp out, just drive around."
That sort of furious activity is, of course, a function of a heated market. Until the current quarter, in which preliminary data are indicating a slight leveling off, average sales prices in Manhattan below 96th Street increased five straight quarters, according to one survey, by the Halstead Property Company. "Pretty stunning appreciation, by any standard," said Clark Halstead, the company's founder.
Over the last year, the Halstead report said, prices for all apartments increased 13 percent, with a large two-bedroom jumping 20.1 percent, to $790,416.
Price increases in the suburbs have been less dramatic, but still substantial. In northern New Jersey, for example, the state's Association of Realtors reported that the median price increased 7.2 percent in the 18 months ended in June, from $188,100 to $201,300. And in Westchester, the median price increased 4.8 percent in the last year, from $292,000 to $306,000.
To be sure, those numbers point to the possibility of reaping abundant satisfaction from the current market. Witness Ms. Corcoran's tale of a gleeful turnaround for one couple who signed a contract in February to pay $1.4 million for a two-bedroom condominium on the Upper East Side. "They immediately changed their mind, even considered losing their deposit -- 10 percent," Ms. Corcoran recalled. "But the broker convinced them to make the deal and resell."
The couple closed on the apartment in May and immediately listed it for $1.5 million. "They had three offers above their asking price within five days," Ms. Corcoran said. The winning bid: $1.74 million -- $340,000 more than the couple had paid in May.
But, given its potential for confounding machinations, multiple bidding also carries with it the possibility for difficulty beyond mere aggravation. There is, of course, the possibility of overpaying. And then there is the risk of legal entanglement.
Michael Finder, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan, said he generally advises buyers: "Don't participate in a bidding war because, once the game starts, you never know where the ceiling is going to be. What are technically not auctions, these days, often evolve into de facto auctions and it's easy to overpay."
For those sellers who court multiple bids, Mr. Finder cautions that they could find themselves liable to claims for commissions from several brokers, each of whom has produced a prospective buyer who was "ready, willing and able" (the legal standard for such a claim) to make the deal.
"Let's say Broker A calls and says, 'John Doe is willing to pay your asking price,' and you say, 'Great,' " Mr. Finder said. "An hour later, Broker B calls and says that Jane Jones would like to buy the house. You respond by saying, 'Somebody's already offered me my asking price.' Broker B says, 'Well, I've been authorized to offer $10,000 over because she really wants it,' and you say, 'Great.' Then you proceed to sign a contract with Jane Jones.
" 'Great' sounds like assent, doesn't it? It's not like, 'I want to think about it.' There's no reservation expressed there. I have had, fairly commonly, sellers call up and say, 'Gee, do I have a problem here?' where they have five buyers all willing to pay a price above asking, each brought in by a separate broker. And the answer is there is the possibility that four of those brokers will make claims."
Sometimes, said Ms. Donahue, those brokers will hire a lawyer "to recover any money put out for bank application fees or from hiring an engineer for an inspection."
Even more daunting, in New Jersey, where the requirements for what constitutes a real estate sales contract were relaxed by the Legislature last year, a seller might be liable for far more than the commissions of thwarted brokers. Unwittingly, he or she might sell the same property to more than one buyer, said Eric M. Davis, a real estate lawyer who practices in both New Jersey and New York.
"Sellers must be very cautious about competitive bidding in New Jersey because what was considered a safeguard, namely that they needed a written contract, may not be required," Mr. Davis said.
The vice chairman for real estate for the New Jersey Bar Association, Joel M. Rosen, concurs with Mr. Davis's interpretation of the change in the law, but believes the likelihood of legal problems is slim because of other safeguards in the system.
Real estate transactions in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut all fall under what is called the Statute of Frauds, a common-law principle legislatively adopted in all three states, which establishes the standards for a legal writing, or contract. In the interests of consumer protection, the New Jersey Legislature revised the Statute of Frauds so that an exchange of letters could be construed as a contract.
"Let's say you own a house in Bergen County and I offer to buy your house for $150,000 by sending you a letter," Mr. Davis said. "And you respond to that letter by saying, 'Yes, I'm interested,' and then write back saying that the offer is acceptable with a term for closing in 45 days and describe the property."
Because of the change in law, a purchaser might be able to obtain a legal determination that he or she has, indeed, acquired the property. "This becomes a problem where a seller has sent out letters to several people in an effort to get a higher price," Mr. Davis said.
MR. ROSEN of the bar association said, "That could happen, but my own feeling is that such would be an extraordinarily isolated case." New Jersey (unlike New York or Connecticut) has a statutory three-day "Attorney Review Period," during which either party to a real estate sales contract can back out of the deal for any or no reason without damages.
"Really, what happens," Mr. Rosen said, "is that most transactions for a house are done through a broker, which means, by virtue of the three-day review requirement, that there will be a written contract. So it is extremely unlikely that the parties would memorialize the transaction through an exchange of letters that could conceivably be recognized as a sufficient writing under the revised Statute of Frauds."
Still, with the parameters of the change in the statute not yet drawn by the courts, Mr. Davis said: "The big warning to sellers who are engaging in multiple bidding in New Jersey is that you may become a test case. Rarely is there glory in being a test case; however, there certainly are legal expenses."
With all the psychological and legal complications, Randi Hutton's advice to all parties is to avoid combat. Ms. Hutton, a broker at Weichert Realtors in Westport, Conn., said that if an agent thinks there are going to be multiple offers on a property, "which you do know when you have contact with other agents, then I suggest the agent go to the seller and advise them not to accept the first offer, but rather go to a closed bidding situation.
"You want everybody to have a chance to go to their highest, best offer," she said. "That's what you as a professional have to be able to do, present it in a way that you're doing this for fairness. The worst way for everybody is to create a bidding frenzy, because when you do that trust gets lost."
For the Joyners, the Brooklyn couple whose ability to trust had already been pummeled, there would be further blows during their ongoing search for an apartment with a bedroom for Camara, their night-wandering toddler.
After finally telling that one shifty seller where to go, the Joyners set their sights on a prewar building on Eastern Parkway. But, one after another, their offers for five apartments there were rejected.
Then, seemingly, hopefully, at last, their bid on a three-bedroom in that same building was accepted; the contract signed, the check sent. "So, we went on vacation to celebrate," Ms. Joyner said, "and the whole time we were checking our bank account to see if the check was cashed, calling our lawyer to see if they had signed the contract. And their lawyer kept saying, 'Any day now.'
"We get back home from vacation only to discover from our realtor that they had signed a contract with another party and they were holding onto our check and contract as a backup."
To avoid just those sort of setbacks, some buyers have resorted to sometimes simple, sometimes incautious, tactics.
In a sealed-bid auction, one buyer, his sights set on a two-bedroom co-op on the Upper East Side, bid just above what he figured the apartment would go for and won by a margin of $132 -- his $360,132 offer edging out the next highest bid of $360,000.
Other buyers take the risk, sometimes successfully, of forgoing standard contingency clauses in the contract to rivet the interest of the seller.
"You can get caught up in the frenzy," said Mr. Rosen of the New Jersey bar association. "I've seen buyers in a bidding war, for example, agree to do away with the ordinary request for a home-inspection contingency, or a mortgage contingency. What makes it reckless is the fact that they may be bound to the contract and then be unable to actually obtain financing."
Steven and Terry Lewis took that chance and, fortunately, won.
THE Lewises paid $649,000 for a house they actually don't want -- a "small ranch on an acre" down the road from their home in Westport, Conn. "The new house, actually, I purchased to tear it down and build a new one," said Mr. Lewis, a stockbroker.
The Lewises, who have an 8-year-old daughter, Madison, hope to sell their current home for at least $1.3 million and use the difference to build a bigger house on the new property.
"Six hundred and forty-nine thousand for a small ranch," Mr. Lewis said. "When I was a kid I figured I'd be living in a mansion for $649,000."
And, yet, on the day he found out that the house was on the market, Mr. Lewis "ran over there, gave them my check." The next day, he found out that there were six backup bids and numerous other inquiries. "I went full price and I waived all my contingencies, mortgage and inspection," Mr. Lewis said. "I figured I wouldn't even give them time to think."
The reason he acted so quickly, Mr. Lewis said, was frustration. Several weeks earlier, he had tried to buy vacant property by the beach in Westport and lost out to a builder. "We both bid full price, $545,000, for a piece of empty land." The sellers went to sealed bids. The builder won, at $577,500, Mr. Lewis said. "So I knew I didn't want to get into another bidding war."
As for Carol and Gerald Joyner, they, too, were -- finally -- rewarded for their frustrations.
A few weeks after returning from that frenetic vacation, only to find that once again they had been strung along by a bet-hedging seller, another apartment in the same building on Eastern Parkway became available.
"Within a couple of months we had a contract, closed and moved," Ms. Joyner said. "It's a beautiful three-bedroom with views of Manhattan and lovely space, wonderful light."
The price (perhaps some hint of cosmic justice): $180,000, "much less than any of those other apartments," Ms. Joyner said.
"And Camara loves it. She likes her own bed, and when people come to the house she takes them by the hand and says, 'Come, let's play in my room.' "

An Independent Bookshop Puts Focus on Brooklyn
Nick Kaufmann and Phil Presby realized a mutual lifelong dream with the opening of Tell-Tale Books, their new shop in Brooklyn. Tell-Tale Books, at 314 Sackett Street in Carroll Gardens, offers new and used editions, mystery titles as well as fiction, nonfiction and children's literature. Tell-Tale specializes in books about Brooklyn and titles by writers who live there. 
 Superstores and chains dominate many markets these days. By contrast, Tell-Tale is a small independent bookstore with 400 square feet of space and 3,500 titles. How can its owners compete with the new 23,500-square-foot Barnes & Noble store in Park Slope, which has more than 150,000 titles? The owners said they hoped to attract book buyers who appreciated that the person working behind the register, the owner, had a particular interest in accommodating and satisfying the customer.
"As the owners and the staff, Nick Kaufmann and I are able to quickly accommodate customers, fulfill special requests and respond to suggestions," Mr. Presby said. "And between the two of us, we have read at least one novel by virtually every author on the store's shelf."
Other incentives for customers at Tell-Tale are a "frequent buyer" program, a discount on all hard-cover books and free delivery within 48 hours to homes and offices in Brooklyn or Manhattan.
 
Back-to-Basics Italian Food At Gemelli in Trade Center
Tony May, who owns San Domenico in Manhattan and Hostaria in Port Chester, N.Y., has opened a new restaurant named Gemelli, which means "twins" in Italian, on the ground floor of 4 World Trade Center. With the help of its executive chef, Emanuele Cappellini, Gemelli serves back-to-basics Italian cuisine.
Mr. May expects the appetites of workers around the Trade Center to keep tables filled at lunch and he hopes to draw larger dinner crowds as the current wave of residential development downtown swells. Lunch patrons at Gemelli may choose from the restaurant's regular menu, with entree prices up to $30, or a less expensive cafe menu that features a $12.50 lunch that offers pasta, pizza or soup, salad and beverage.
Outdoor seating, on Austin J. Tobin Plaza, and an open kitchen are two of the restaurant's distinctive features.
