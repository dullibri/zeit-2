HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES; 
Euro Climbs Above Record It Set Shortly After Its Birth

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The euro soared to a record against the dollar in Europe yesterday, giving a lift to United States exporters but deepening the pain for the Continent's struggling economies and American tourists in Europe.
 The euro reached a high of $1.1932 in trading in Europe, breaking the old high of $1.1884 set Jan. 4, 1999, a few days after the euro began to circulate as the shared currency of 12 European countries. 
In New York, the euro edged higher, trading at $1.1845 late in the day, up from $1.1827 on Friday. 
 Among those who benefit from a weaker dollar are United States companies that sell goods overseas, many of which have reported increased earnings in recent weeks because of the weaker dollar. Those who are put at a disadvantage include Europe's export-fueled industries, which are losing their pricing edge over their United States rivals, and Americans who would like to take European vacations or buy imported goods like French wine and German sports cars, which now cost more.
"This is a burden," said Michael Rogowski, the head of the Federation of German Industry. "Every cent above one-to-one gives me bigger stomach pains."
Currency markets have become convinced that the Bush administration is willing to accept the weaker dollar, based on remarks by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, including his statement two weeks ago that the dollar's slide was "fairly modest." That started a dollar sell-off that accelerated a more gradual fall over the last 16 months.
Reasons for the dollar's slide include foreign investors' disenchantment with United States stocks and economic prospects. They must sell dollars to move out of American assets, and that drives down the exchange rate.Higher interest rates in Europe, meanwhile. have drawn investors into euros.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: VIOLENCE; 
Gunmen Kill 2 U.S. Soldiers In a Firefight in Central Iraq

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: FALLUJA, Iraq, May 27 

 BODY:
In a second day of deadly guerrilla attacks on American convoys in Iraq, unidentified gunmen fired machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades at a column of military vehicles near the Euphrates River Bridge here today, killing two American soldiers, military officials said.
 Nine other soldiers were wounded in the firefight that erupted here about 1:30 a.m., civilian witnesses said. An American armored vehicle and a medical evacuation helicopter were also destroyed. Residents said the helicopter was struck by a grenade round after it landed to recover dead and wounded soldiers, but military officials said it was struck accidentally by an armored vehicle maneuvering near it. 
 Military officials said two of the attackers were killed and six captured in this restive town some 35 miles west of Baghdad, where 15 Iraqis were killed and dozens were wounded in clashes last month, and two more Iraqis died after they attacked American soldiers last week. 
One resident who said he was a former brigadier in the armed forces of Saddam Hussein said that residents were carrying out organized resistance and that they would keep attacking American forces until dead Iraqis were avenged.
Two similar attacks on American soldiers occurred on Monday. Two soldiers were killed and five were wounded in those separate assaults on convoys in Baghdad and near the Syrian border city of Qaim.
As American troops keep flowing into Iraq to provide greater security and departures of other troops are delayed to strengthen police functions, military commanders continue to express private concerns about whether they have sufficient forces to re-establish a stable postwar environment.
L. Paul Bremer III, the top civilian administrator of the occupation authority, said Monday that the allies would issue food ration cards on June 1 and restart the food distribution channels used by the Hussein government.
"In the long run, we would like to get out of the situation where 60 percent of the people are dependent on the government for their food," he said.
Tonight, Falluja remained tense as American troops stood guard in static positions in command posts protected by razor wire and Bradley fighting vehicles. Other troops positioned themselves at roadblocks.
"All the people are very happy with this operation," said one resident of the town, referring to the attack on the American soldiers. He identified himself as Barakal Jassim al-Zobai, a brigadier in the disbanded Iraqi Republican Guard. 
"We want to revenge all of the martyrs that Falluja gave and we will not allow American forces to occupy Iraq," he said. Mr. Zobai said guerrilla teams had been formed to exact revenge on American forces.
The episodes of violence here have radicalized some residents who have vowed revenge, residents said. 
"We are tribal people and we won't allow anyone to intrude in our lives," said a 27-year-old farmer who witnessed the attack early this morning. He refused to give his full name and called himself Abu Muhammad.
"The Americans have really hurt us," he said. "They didn't come here to give us liberty, or free us. They came here to invade us."
Also today, the United States Central Command said in a statement that allied forces had captured two senior Baath Party officials who ranked 46th and 55th on the list of most wanted members of Mr. Hussein's government. Troops on Saturday detained Sayf al-Din al-Mashhadani, chairman of the Muthanna governorate, and Sad Abed al-Majd al-Faysal, chairman of the Salah al-Din governorate. 
As allied forces sought to shift the focus on Iraq's economic recovery, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain was due in Kuwait on Wednesday to meet with senior officials of the desert emirate. Mr. Blair was expected to make a brief visit to southern Iraq, where British forces continue to garrison Basra, the largest southern city; the port of Umm Qasr; and major oil installations.
While many cities in Iraq have returned to a measure of normality, Falluja has become a bastion of resistance and hostility to occupation.
On the roadside where the firefight took place, a small group of men gathered to describe the battle and express their deep suspicion of Western intentions in Iraq. None of the men said they supported the return of Mr. Hussein, but they asserted that they resented the arrival of Western forces here.
"We want to be free," the man who identified himself as Abu Muhammad said. "We can govern ourselves. A million Saddam Husseins would be better than having one American soldier in our streets."
Mr. Zobai, 34, said he was among the 72 families who were displaced from army housing at Baghdad's international airport. He said United States military officials had refused to allow the families to return to their homes to reclaim belongings.
"If you come to our country as a guest, we will welcome you," he said with the bravado typical of the warrior class that filled the upper ranks of Mr. Hussein's elite army forces. "But if you come as an invader, we will cut off your heads, and we will show them what street fighting is."

HEADLINE: Confidence and Home Sales Rose Solidly Last Month 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27 

 BODY:
Low mortgage rates beckoned buyers in April and propelled sales of new homes to the highest level this year and sales of previously owned homes to the fifth-best month on record, reports released today showed.
 The Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose 1.7 percent from March to April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.03 million. That was the best showing since December. 
 In a second report, sales of previously owned homes rose 5.6 percent in the same period to an annual rate of 5.84 million, the fifth-highest level on record, the National Association of Realtors, a trade group, said.
Both reports provided fresh evidence that the housing market continues to be one of the few bright spots for the economy. "Low mortgage rates are keeping the housing market red hot," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.
A third report, from the Conference Board, a private research group, showed that consumer confidence rose in May.
The Consumer Confidence Index rose to 83.8 in May from 81 in April, when the index jumped 19.6 points as consumers cheered the swift end of heavy fighting in Iraq. It was the highest level since a reading of 84.9 in November. Analysts had projected an index of 84 for May.
"The postwar euphoria experienced last month has quickly given way and consumers' focus has returned to matters on the home front," said Lynn Franco, director of the group's Consumer Research Center.
The performance for sales of new homes and existing ones surprised economists. They were predicting new-home sales to drop 2.7 percent and existing-home sales to rise to a rate of 5.70 million.
In March, new-home sales jumped 8.2 percent, while existing-home sales fell 5.6 percent.
Low mortgage rates drove home sales to record levels last year, and this year is shaping up to be second-best for sales of existing homes and new ones, economists say.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in April was 5.81 percent, compared with 6.99 percent for the same month a year ago.
Rates on 30-year mortgages dropped to a new low of 5.34 percent last week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant, said. It was the seventh time this year that this benchmark mortgage rate fell to a weekly low.
"With interest rates near rock-bottom, it is really a why-not-buy deal," said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.
By region, in the Midwest, new-home sales jumped 13.4 percent in April from the month before, to an annual rate of 186,000. In the West, sales rose 4.3 percent, to a rate of 267,000, and in the South they went up 0.6 percent, to a rate of 487,000. In the Northeast, however, sales fell 17.8 percent, to a rate of 88,000.
For previously owned homes -- the biggest chunk of the housing market -- sales rose 9.6 percent in the West, to an annual rate of 1.60 million in April. In the Northeast, existing-home sales went up 4.8 percent, to a rate of 660,000, and in the South, sales increased 4.1 percent, to a pace of 2.31 million. In the Midwest, sales also rose 4.1 percent, to a rate of 1.27 million.

HEADLINE: Ideologically Broad Coalition Assails F.C.C. Media Plan 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27 

 BODY:
A broad coalition of both conservative and liberal organizations expressed deep criticism today of a plan by the Federal Communications Commission to relax the rules that have restricted the nation's largest media conglomerates from growing bigger.
 The groups took part in a meeting convened by the two Democratic commissioners, Michael J. Copps and Jonathan S. Adelstein, who oppose the plan. But few, if any, of the participants expected that the meeting would change the outcome of next week's vote on the matter. The commission's three Republicans have already signaled their intention to support the changes. 
 The debate is likely to continue afterward in Congress -- the five commissioners are expected to testify at a Senate hearing a few days after the vote. And some lawmakers have already begun to lay the groundwork to reverse the commission on some of the rules even before the agency has voted to change them. Soon before going into this week's recess, several prominent members in the House and the Senate introduced legislation to preserve some of the rules. But it was unclear whether they would have the votes to overcome the agency's expected action.
The meeting today illustrated that no issue has created more of a furor at the commission in recent years than this proposal, which would allow conglomerates to enter more markets and control both newspapers and broadcasters in more than 100 cities. In recent weeks, the commissioners have received hundreds of thousands of comments urging them to delay their action.
The F.C.C. has scheduled a hearing for Monday at which the three Republican commissioners are expected to rewrite the rule that prevented a company from owning both a broadcast station and a newspaper in the same market. The commission is also expected to permit a company to own three television stations in the most competitive markets, and to relax the rule that has prohibited a network from owning television stations that reach more than 35 percent of the nation's viewers.
The groups criticizing the plan reflect an odd alliance. They include the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the National Rifle Association, the National Organization for Women, the Writers Guild of America, the Parents Television Council, Consumers Union and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Representatives from the organizations said the number of diverse groups opposed to the commission's action illustrated deep national discomfort with the F.C.C. proposal. 
Mr. Copps and Mr. Adelstein have held meetings around the country on the proposal and have heard widespread opposition to the changes. They received support today from Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who is running for president. Dr. Dean sent a letter to Michael K. Powell, the commission's chairman, urging him to postpone the vote.
Mr. Powell has already rejected similar requests, and officials said that the commission would not alter its schedule.
Supporters of the proposal, who are led by Mr. Powell and include the major broadcast networks and some large news conglomerates, say that technology and the proliferation of competition have rendered the current rules unnecessary. They say that free over-the-air television may be jeopardized without changes as more expensive programming migrates to subscription services offered by cable and satellite companies. 
But critics say that while the number of pipelines into the home may have increased -- cable and satellite broadcasters offer hundreds of channels, and Internet choices are virtually unlimited -- a handful of large corporations dominate the production of content for those pipelines.
"Diversity of voices, not merely the variety of programming, is what matters," said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. He said that in moving to change the rules, the commission had promoted "economic efficiency to the exclusion of diversity of voices and viewpoints."
The opponents contended that the changes would sharply reduce the diversity of views on the airwaves, further limit opportunities for women and minorities, discourage coverage of local issues and lead to greater violence on television. In many cities, they say, the changes will also give even fewer corporate interests control over news and entertainment. 
"People don't want a few big corporations controlling their access to information and news," said Eli Pariser of MoveOn.org, an Internet advocacy group founded by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs that presented the agency with 150,000 online comments opposed to the changes.
They also said that the consolidation of the radio industry after it was deregulated in 1996 was a harbinger for the television and newspaper industries.
"Radio clearly is the coal mine canary," said Michael Bracy of the Future of Music Coalition, a nonprofit group devoted to promoting diversity on the airwaves. He said that after the consolidation, the number of radio listeners was at the lowest point in 27 years and most local markets were controlled by four or fewer companies.

HEADLINE: To Graduation, Tossing Obstacles Aside 

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER 

 BODY:
College commencement signifies the end of a journey, often long and arduous. But for some graduating seniors, the trip involves extra twists and turns. Here are the stories of graduates with their own special reasons to celebrate.

RON FRANCIS
By God's Grace, and Others'
 Ron Francis's mother, Linda, credits God with her son's graduation from Gettysburg College. But even Mrs. Francis, a member of a Pentecostal church, acknowledges that God did not work alone. 
 There was Philadelphia Futures, which pairs low-income public school students with volunteer mentors and brought Mr. Francis to the attention of David Boldt and his wife, Kelly, when he was a ninth grader. The Boldts pledged to do whatever it took to prepare Mr. Francis for college, which included having him move in with them. There was Temple University, which provided a summer math enrichment program, and Germantown Friends, an elite private high school, which gave Mr. Francis a scholarship.
There was Jon Landau, an immigration lawyer who got green cards for Mr. Francis, his mother and older brother, who immigrated from Jamaica in 1987. There was Charles Burton, a member of the Gettysburg College board, who helped Mr. Francis win a scholarship and drove him back and forth from Philadelphia for semester breaks. 
There was Mr. Francis's mother, who scrubbed floors to support her family, and prayed. Finally, of course, there was Mr. Francis, whose diligence and hopefulness made people want to help him. "I knew I possessed the potential to do anything I wanted," said Mr. Francis, 23, who majored in economics and is trying to get a job in Web design. "It was just a matter of finding the resources."
Ms. Francis took her children to Philadelphia for the educational opportunities. "A lot of people worked very hard," she said. "David and Kelly were a blessing. They saw how I was struggling."
Mr. Boldt is a former editor and columnist at The Philadelphia Inquirer who now teaches high school history in Bolivia. Mrs. Boldt made the trip to Pennsylvania for the graduation. Mr. Boldt got every detail of the event on May 18 via computer instant messaging with Mr. Francis and his brother, Kevin.
"I was telling Ron he has to get ready for the next phase," Mr. Boldt said in a telephone interview.
"Graduating from college is a steppingstone. He has to look at the next fence he has to jump over. I hope he's at the point where he can do that himself."

HEADLINE: Pressure Increases For Tighter Limits On Injury Lawsuits 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Arguing that legal costs and big jury awards are overwhelming them, insurance companies and other businesses have stepped up efforts in the states to restrict medical malpractice lawsuits and other kinds of personal injury suits.
 Bills are now pending in more than 20 states, and lawmakers have approved measures in at least 11 more states this year, as tracked by proponents of the lawsuit restrictions. The bills aim to limit awards for pain and suffering, reduce the amount of money that defendants must pay to appeal a decision and apportion liability for damages based on a defendant's share of any blame. 
 Businesses have not given up on Washington. Frustrated by difficulty getting broad litigation relief, they are pushing Congress for legislation to address specific concerns that cannot easily be dealt with by the states, like asbestos liability. 
"This is unprecedented because it's coming, at least from my perspective as a trial lawyer in New York, from the national, state and local level," said Jeffrey A. Lichtman, a lawyer at Trolman Glaser & Lichtman and president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association. Businesses perceive Republican-majority legislatures and the Republican White House as friendly to their cause. It has not hurt, Mr. Lichtman added, that President Bush mentioned the risks of "frivolous lawsuits" in his State of the Union address in January. 
Legislative battles in the states have also become intense as doctors protest what they call the effects of costly malpractice insurance and lawsuits. Hospitals in some states have closed their obstetrics departments because the risk of lawsuits and the price of liability insurance are both too high, an issue that resonates with the public. Measures drafted to reduce doctors' liability often contain language that will also limit other kinds of liability.
"This is a year where we had seen considerable opportunity at the state level, and the major reason is the health care issue has been driving the agenda," said Sherman Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform Association. 
Just last week, doctors held a poorly attended rally in Manhattan in favor of changing state laws on tort litigation -- civil lawsuits arising from claims of injury, including injury as a result of malpractice. Doctors and insurers blame jury verdicts for the high premiums.
"That's where you see these losses," said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute in New York. The average medical malpractice award rose to $3.9 million in 2001, from $3.41 million in 2000 and $3.29 million in 1999, according to the institute.
Trial lawyers say the insurance companies are suffering because of the weak economy, not because of lawsuits against doctors or other clients.
"The stock market is low and interest rates are low, and insurance companies have to make their profits," said Mark Phenicie, legislative counsel for the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association. The companies are using higher premiums to try to protect profits, he said.
Trial lawyers in several states have organized fierce counterattacks against coalitions of insurance companies, doctors and other businesses in a test of lobbying and marketing power. In New York, the lawyers have begun an advertising campaign depicting the victims of medical malpractice and citing cases where lawsuits resulted in safer products. In Pennsylvania, trial lawyers have paid for radio ads and are sending letters to lawmakers. In Florida they are combining both strategies with other efforts to reach voters and lawmakers.
The push for legislation in the states does not mean that Washington has been abandoned. The House of Representatives approved a bill in March that would cap an award for pain and suffering at $250,000. However, Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of Southern California who has followed the battles over tort litigation, said that most tort law is state law.
"There are no federal laws with regard to when you can hold manufacturers or doctors or lawyers or anyone liable," Mr. Chemerinsky said. "All of that is covered by state law, and every state can have its own rules. So product liability law, for example, is the product of 50 different states' product liability laws."
Small-business owners like Frank Ciotola are optimistic that state laws will be changed this year. Mr. Ciotola, who owns an Italian restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, and heads a state board of the National Federation of Independent Business, is coping with a lawsuit filed by a customer who said she slipped on a step. 
"I can't speak to the specifics," he said. "But in our case, there is a demand for $1 million in punitive damages."
If the jury awarded damages, Mr. Ciotola said, it would be a "death blow" to his restaurant. Fear of lawsuits -- let alone actual suits -- takes time and money away from running the business, he added.
Large companies also want changes to tort laws, said Michael Baroody, executive vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "It's as nearly a universal a proposition as there is in the business community that the current tort system is massively dysfunctional."
The trial lawyers argue that current laws are essential to protect the rights of victims of negligence, malpractice or wrongdoing. 
"We're trying to put a face on the story," said Mr. Phenicie of the Pennsylvania trial lawyers. In advertisements, the association uses short summaries of injuries suffered by individuals and of the money they recovered through a lawsuit. The association is working with clergy groups, labor groups and organizations representing the elderly, among others, Mr. Phenicie said.
"We have had individual case studies with pictures and a story about Pennsylvania victims mailed to every legislator," he said.
According to the American Tort Reform Association, which is tracking bills across the country, legislation that would limit defendants' liability in some way is under consideration in several states, including Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Texas. Some states, like Iowa, may take up legislation again in special sessions, and in other states plans are under way to reintroduce such measures in the fall.
Because state laws differ, proposed changes are not the same in every state. In California, for example, defense lawyers for years have attacked a law that allows individuals to file suits on behalf of the public; not many states have such a broad provision.
But there are common elements in the legislative proposals. The first target is often joint and several liability, which may result in one defendant who is only partly responsible for an injury bearing the full burden of a judgment. The principle was intended to ensure that victims were fully compensated, but defendants argue it is unfair. Ohio and Oklahoma have already modified their joint and several liability rules.
Another target is the size of jury awards. Lawmakers in Texas, for example, will consider a bill limiting noneconomic damages -- for pain and suffering, for example -- in medical malpractice suits to a total of $750,000, said Ralph Wayne, president of the Texas Civil Justice League. The organization hadinitially pushed for a cap of $250,000, he said. Idaho capped punitive damages at $250,000 in March.
"We're on the cusp of passing this," Mr. Wayne said.
Sizable verdicts are also a target because to appeal a decision, companies facing multimillion-dollar penalties often must post a bond equal to the full penalty. In some cases, lawyers have argued, putting up the full amount of the damage award would exceed the value of a company. 
Philip Morris said last month that it might have to file for bankruptcy protection to put up a $12 billion bond while it appealed a judgment in Illinois. The company ultimately persuaded the judge to reduce the bond. 
In New York, doctors are seeking most of these restrictions and some other specialized measures. They want to receive more information about expert witnesses used by plaintiffs, as well as a cap on damages for pain and suffering, said Elizabeth Dears Kent, counsel to the division of governmental affairs of the Medical Society of New York. 
Neither advocates of change nor the trial lawyers would discuss how much money they are spending this year. Both sides -- on the one hand, corporations and doctors, and on the other, plaintiffs' lawyers who have won large settlements from the tobacco industry and elsewhere -- have access to deep pockets.
"Businesses have made a priority of tort reform right now at the federal and state level that really justifies making a big push," said Mr. Chemerinsky, the law professor. "Businesses see this as a window that they've not had before."

HEADLINE: An Erosion of the Social Contract 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The hysterical hand-wringing by the left over the modest tax cut just passed by Congress would have some credibility if there were a reaction in the bond market, which is unforgiving when it comes to policy blunders (column, May 27). 
 A year ago, some asserted that rising deficits would send interest rates higher; yet interest rates continue to fall, showing that investors are not as concerned about deficits. 
 Reasonable people can disagree about the composition of this tax cut, but the need for stimulus is beyond question when an economy slides.
To worry now about reducing deficits is comparable to putting leeches on ailing patients 300 years ago: it will make the patient sicker. Thankfully, the bond market understands this.

HEADLINE: True Colors, Shining Through. And Taste? 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

DATELINE: TANNERSVILLE, N.Y., May 21 

 BODY:
After Elena Agostinis Patterson painted her gray house orange (and purple and yellow and green -- with dentures in a glass decorating the bedroom shutters and a toothpaste tube on the bathroom ones), a funny thing happened to the traffic patterns in this languishing Catskill Mountains village.
 Drivers took to veering off Main Street onto Hill Street and making a beeline down Cranberry Road onto Ms. Patterson's winding driveway through the woods. There they would stop to gawk at the Technicolor apparition before them, some even hopping out to wander the property, ogling the house. 
 Which got Ms. Patterson thinking: For years the burghers of Tannersville had wondered how to revive the area's economy and its lost tourism glory; if they were serious about making the village a destination, why not do to Tannersville, population 440, what she had done to her house? 
Now plans are in the works to paint Skip Pratt's commercial building on Main Street turquoise, lilac and marigold -- with a five-foot-high portrait of Mr. Pratt and his wife in the style of "American Gothic." There is talk of putting stars and stripes on the back side of Tom McManus's pharmacy, and soap suds, tumbling clothes and a water line on the commercial laundry's shutters.
The mayor of Tannersville, Glenn Weyant, is crazy about the plans. He sees the prospect of Tannersville's economic rebirth in Ms. Patterson's proposal to paint many of the buildings along Main Street in colors like turmeric, marigold and celery. Business owners have signed up, some endorsing Ms. Patterson's color schemes, others substituting their own colors.
But not everyone is thrilled. A delegation of aesthetically minded residents of the village and neighboring hamlets turned up at a meeting of the village board this month, wanting a say in the process and asking that the colors be toned down. Critics have confronted business owners, saying that they find the proposed colors shocking and that they fear Tannersville is going the way of Disney World.
"You know, in Latin there is an expression: de gustibus non disputandum est -- don't argue about taste," said Richard J. Rem, the supervisor for the Town of Hunter, which encompasses the village of Tannersville. "This is an argument about what's artistically and aesthetically appropriate for this village and this town. That's a tough area to handle."
Hunter was a tourism center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the home of major resort hotels, including what is said to have been the largest wooden hotel building in the world. Grover Cleveland and Teddy Roosevelt vacationed here, residents say, along with many members of the social elite of the New York metropolitan area.
But the Depression, interstate highways and air travel took a heavy toll. Then came the economic downturn in the late 1980's and early 1990's, followed by only a partial revival.
Though more and more New Yorkers have been buying second homes in Hunter, there is a dearth of well-paying jobs for permanent residents and the poverty rate is relatively high.
"When things don't get better for 90 years, you don't take risks with the one asset in the world that you have," said Sean M. Byrne, a lawyer and fifth-generation area resident. "And nobody knew Elena before she started this. It required people to put their faith and trust into somebody that they previously didn't know. And that's risky."
Ms. Patterson, a painter and sculptor who grew up in South Africa and lives in Bronxville, first came to Tannersville with her husband, Mark Patterson, an investment banker. They began building a weekend house there in 1986. After expanding it twice, Ms. Patterson decided the north side looked boring. So she had the house painted yellow marigold, periwinkle, orange blossom and split pea.
The stairs to her studio are painted in alternating stripes. The shutters on the front are decorated with icons of activities going on inside. Large boulders next to the driveway have been painted, too. In the back, elaborately painted columns tell the stories of the Patterson family's roots in South Africa, time spent in Mexico and the passions and adventures of their two grown sons.
Inside, the wooden bunk beds in one bedroom are upholstered in pigskin. Another bedroom is decorated in bright red and blue Masai fabric. Mr. Patterson's office is wallpapered in birch.
When Ms. Patterson decided she was unhappy with two white living room chairs covered in cotton, she took acrylic paint and painted them in a cow-skin pattern.
"We had unbelievable traffic coming up to the house," she recalled. "We had some people who walked up in the middle of a rainstorm. We had convoys of cars coming to look at the place. So I went to the mayor and the town supervisor toward the end of last summer. I said, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could have that kind of traffic in Tannersville?' "
Mr. Weyant, the mayor, who quit his job running an aerospace-parts distribution center in Florida to run a bed and breakfast inn in Tannersville, jumped at Ms. Patterson's idea. He had already been recruiting prison inmates to paint the village clerk's office and marshaling volunteers to spruce up the sporting goods store.
As it happened, the village and town had applied for several grants to improve the facades of stores and houses in the village. At the Christmas tree lighting ceremony on Main Street, Mr. Weyant mentioned Ms. Patterson's proposal to Mr. Byrne, who is chairman of the Hunter Foundation, a nonprofit organization that is helping pay for some of the facade work.
Mr. Byrne then met with Ms. Patterson at her house. He says he was struck by her skill at blending colors "with impeccably good taste." The house reminded him of "a living Andy Warhol picture."
But he says he never imagined she would be able to convince business owners with the ease with which she since has. "That was what I saw as the big challenge," he said.
There are now about half a dozen buildings on Main Street scheduled for Patterson-influenced paint jobs as part of the facade project, and another group that will be painted independently under the aegis of the owners themselves. And Ms. Patterson is working with the owners of another four businesses on plans that might go into effect later this year when another grant comes through.
Word of the plans trickled out. Carol A. Vannuchi says she heard about it in the Quickway market and made a point of going to this month's village board meeting. Also at the meeting was Dede Terns-Thorpe, a resident of the neighboring hamlet of Haines Falls, where she serves on the board of the library and is a member of the ladies' fire auxiliary.
"My personal feeling is these colors should be staying more historical," Mrs. Terns-Thorpe said. "They make like a sage green and white."
She added: "Stay with the yellow but go with a historical yellow. The colors were fine but they should be tamed way down. You know, a very pale yellow is pretty."
Maggie N. Landis, the owner of a 133-year-old Victorian building in the center of town that houses Maggie's Krooked Cafe, said she had worked with Ms. Patterson to come up with a mutually acceptable color scheme. She said she had wanted colors that she felt fit with the historic nature of the community as well as with the natural environment.
And Mr. Rem, the town supervisor?
"You're throwing me into the cauldron here," he protested, chuckling, when asked his opinion. "Yes, I have an opinion. I think Elena's got a good idea. And she certainly has demonstrated the energy and ability to make this happen. I think at the same time we do need to keep within certain traditional colors, and that there is a place for a marriage of the two."

Account for Jergens Is Being Reviewed

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
A major account is being placed in review by the Andrew Jergens Company as a result of the recent decision by the Interpublic Group of Companies to merge Bozell in New York into Lowe & Partners Worldwide.
 The review, Jergens said yesterday, is for the account of its personal-care brands like Ban antiperspirant, Biore skin-care products, Jergens lotions and John Frieda hair products. 
The brands had been handled by Bozell until they were shifted to Lowe with the merger in February. Although billings were not disclosed, Jergens and Frieda spent $90.1 million on advertising in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 Brad Kirk, vice president for marketing and strategic planning at Jergens in Cincinnati, confirmed a report of the review in Adweek.com. Jergens is open to moving the account to another Interpublic agency, Mr. Kirk said, but potential future conflicts at Lowe spurred the decision to begin the review.
The reference was to a major Lowe client, Johnson & Johnson. Lowe does not work on Johnson & Johnson products that might compete with Jergens brands, but the potential for such conflict in the future concerns Jergens enough for it to leave Lowe.
AAR Partners in New York is managing the review for Jergens, which is part of the Kao Corporation.

HEADLINE: Delta Gets Some Stiff Competition on a KeyRoute 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 27 

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines is scrambling to cope with competition that has spread as quickly here as a California wildfire: two low-cost airlines are challenging it for passengers between this city and Atlanta, on what until now was the country's biggest nonstop route with no rivalry.
 The entrance of JetBlue Airways and AirTran Airways into the market is forcing Delta to increase by about 50 percent the number of daily flights and to offer triple miles to frequent fliers on that route. Most noticeably, it has also drastically cut fares -- from at least $1,151 for a one-way walk-up ticket in March to $249 for a nonrefundable one-way walk-up fare in June. 
 Delta's response is typical of the behavior of big network carriers when low-cost rivals encroach on their routes. JetBlue made its inaugural flight between Atlanta and the airport in Los Angeles County's second-largest city, Long Beach, on May 8, and AirTran is starting twice-daily service on June 4 between Los Angeles International Airport and Atlanta, which serves as a hub for both it and Delta. 
The Los Angeles-Atlanta route is Delta's second-largest domestic market, and the airline is not about to give up those passengers without a fight -- even if that means losing money in the short term by ramping up its operations at a time when air travel is sluggish.
The intense rivalry on this route and the consequent benefits for travelers are emblematic of large-scale changes taking place in the airline industry. Seeking new markets to conquer and taking advantage of technological improvements that let smaller jets fly longer and higher, the low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines are moving more and more into the transcontinental routes once dominated by network airlines. The recent decisions by network airlines to scale back on flights because of the weak economy also leave them more vulnerable to attack from the expanding low-cost carriers.
When threatened like this, the traditional airlines either drop the routes altogether or they cut fares and add capacity -- at a time when executives and industry analysts say there is an oversupply of seats in the air.
"It would be quite a stretch to interpret Delta's capacity increase as simply a response to strong demand," said Jamie Baker, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase. "Rather, it's a response to strong competition."
In June, AirTran will be flying 312 seats a day each way between Los Angeles International Airport and Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. JetBlue is already flying 486 seats a day each way between Long Beach Airport and Hartsfield. Mr. Baker calculated that Delta is offering 2,876 seats one way on a typical weekday this June -- a 38 percent increase over June last year and a 30 percent increase over June 2001, before the Sept. 11 attacks caused air travel to plummet.
Delta's sudden infusion of seats is all the more surprising because it goes against the airline's general strategy to cope with the weak economy, which is to cut domestic capacity by 12 percent, Mr. Baker said.
Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for Delta, acknowledged that increased competition was one factor spurring the addition of flights, but she also said that "there's such a strong passenger demand for our Atlanta-Los Angeles service that we thought we'd be able to meet that demand."
She added that Delta was cutting fares, even with strong demand, to stay competitive with its rivals.
Delta's lowest one-way fare in June between Los Angeles and Atlanta is $119, charged for a nonrefundable ticket bought at least a week before departure, said Terry Trippler, an fare expert at Cheapseats.com. That matches the lowest fare from both AirTran and JetBlue, though JetBlue requires tickets be bought 14 days in advance to get that fare. Last June, Delta's cheapest ticket was a $198 round trip that required a 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stay. A business traveler who had to buy a ticket less than two weeks in advance paid at least $1,031 each way last June.
For years, Delta was shielded from market pressures on the Los Angeles-Atlanta route because it had very little nonstop competition. Eastern Airlines dropped out about a decade ago, and United Airlines left in September 2001 after flying the route for two years.
Then on Feb. 18, JetBlue said it would start service three times a day in May between Long Beach and Atlanta. David Neeleman, chief executive of JetBlue, said that his airline had picked the new route because Delta's monopoly hold on nonstop flights probably meant that the market was underserved.
JetBlue, with its fleet of new Airbus A320's, is doing more transcontinental flying than any other low-cost carrier. Robert W. Mann, an industry consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y., said that long-haul flying allows airlines to get more from passengers for the fixed fees it has to pay out, like the $2.50-a-leg security tax levied by the government and suspended by lawmakers until Sept. 30. Long-distance routes also allow airlines to schedule late-night flights, which ratchet up efficiency by increasing the number of hours a day a plane is used.
Improvements in aircraft technology are also opening up the world of transcontinental flying for low-cost airlines. In the early 1990's, most low-cost airlines used DC-9's or second-generation Boeing 737's, neither of which could fly from coast to coast. But Boeing and Airbus soon began improving the range of their smaller aircraft, and even Southwest -- founded in the 1970's to provide short-hop service in Texas -- has begun flying cross-country routes, starting with Baltimore-Los Angeles last September.
JetBlue will start its next transcontinental flight on June 26, when it will begin flying once a day between San Diego and Kennedy International Airport in New York, a nonstop route dominated by American Airlines. It will add a second flight each day, starting on July 14.
To match JetBlue's lower prices, American, a unit of AMR, has begun offering a $139 one-way nonrefundable fare that has to be bought one week in advance.
AirTran announced on March 4 that it would start flying twice a day between Los Angeles and Atlanta, starting on June 4. AirTran will fly the route with two Airbus A320's leased from Ryan International Airlines, based in Wichita, Kan. Those planes can fly farther than the Boeing 717's that comprise virtually all of AirTrans's fleet. By leasing them, Mr. Mann said, AirTran can test the market without putting up the cash to buy planes. 
AirTran is also introducing flights between Atlanta and both Denver and Las Vegas this summer. It has also put out a call for proposals for an order of 100 new aircraft from Boeing or Airbus. Those planes, with delivery to begin in 2004, would give AirTran the flexibility to add more transcontinental routes.
Two days after AirTran said it would start service between Los Angeles and Atlanta, Delta said that it would add five flights from Atlanta to Los Angeles and four from Los Angeles to Atlanta throughout the summer. It also said it would add, starting this coming Sunday, an additional flight each way between Atlanta and Ontario, a suburb east of Los Angeles. Many of the fares on these flights matched those of AirTran and JetBlue.
Mr. Mann, the airline consultant, said that the market had probably been underserved since only one airline controlled it. Both he and Mr. Baker, the J. P. Morgan analyst, said the addition of so many flights might seem extreme, but that it was not surprising that a network airline would do this to try to protect market share.
"They're certainly going to lose a lot of money," Mr. Neeleman of JetBlue said. "But carriers faced with competition in markets, they can look the other way or they can react. To react is their prerogative."
Mr. Neeleman declined to say if JetBlue's three-times daily flights between Long Beach and Atlanta were making money. "I don't really know for sure whether they're profitable at this point," he said, "but they're certainly not weighing down the company."

HEADLINE: When Good Friends Make Bad Diplomacy 

BYLINE:  By Yevgenia Albats; Yevgenia Albats is a columnist for Novaya Gazeta.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
It is fitting that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is welcoming President Bush to his hometown of St. Petersburg. An imperial backdrop makes sense for two men creating empires of the 21st century. When Peter the Great built his city 300 years ago, he had two somewhat contradictory purposes in mind. He wanted to showcase Russia's world-power status, but he also wanted to create a "window to Europe." (Europe's hand would poke through, pulling Russia into a more modern era.) The question is which of the two St. Petersburgs Mr. Bush will focus on: the gold-encrusted imperial capital, or the portal to the West and its values of human rights and liberal democracy. 
 My guess is that he'll pick the first, because that's the one President Putin wants him to see. Gone are the days when American presidents stood up to their Russian counterparts and openly pressed them to bring about democratic reform. Now relations at the top are largely about personal friendship. Diplomacy is tied to personality. Bill Clinton related to Russia largely in terms of his relationship with Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Bush has followed suit, making American policy a hostage to his personal attachment to Mr. Putin. 
 This is all rather surprising. Remember that in the 2000 presidential campaign, Mr. Bush and his advisers were critical of the personality-driven approach to diplomacy and of the White House for paying only lip service to ending the epidemic of corruption in Moscow and the brutal war in Chechnya. Yet after taking office, Mr. Bush looked into Mr. Putin's eyes and saw a kindred spirit, and apparently one doesn't ask tough questions of one's soulmate. 
Not much good has come of this style of foreign affairs. Despite this cozy relationship between the leaders, the situation in Russia has not improved. The war in Chechnya continues. Corruption is on the rise (businesses now pay an estimated $33 billion a year in bribes to government officials, equal to about 10 percent of the gross domestic product). And, in terms of personal liberties and democracy, things are much worse than before Mr. Putin came into power. Last month Freedom House, an independent group that monitors civil liberties around the world, downgraded Russia from being a country where the press is "partly free" to one where it is "not free" at all. 
So why is the Bush administration so willing to repeat the mistakes of its predecessor? Why does it seem to be more interested in personality than in working as an agent for democratic change in Russia? The answer, I think, is that it doesn't really believe Russia matters. After all, Russia is no longer a superpower, and it no longer poses a credible threat to the United States. This sentiment was summed up neatly when I recently asked a senior White House aide whether he was concerned about rising anti-American feelings in Russia. His reply: "We don't care." 
And I have to admit, the politics of "don't care" has brought some short-term benefits to the United States, including the NATO expansion in Eastern Europe. However, that American triumph has had unfortunate consequences. The ease with which America waved aside Moscow's objections weakened Mr. Putin among the hard-line nationalists in the bureaucracy, and he was forced to give them a freer hand. Now the parliament is little more than a rubber stamp for the government, and the Kremlin has near-total control of the press. 
The rise of anti-Americanism in political circles has trickled down to the public at large. And it came at the same time that many Russian liberals, who had once seen the United States as a reliable promoter of democratic politics, decided they had been betrayed by Washington and stopped raising their voices against demagogues who see the United States as pure evil. 
Even if the Bush administration won't support Russian democracy for its own sake, it has plenty of pragmatic reasons for pushing Mr. Putin back on track. For one, the 9/11 attacks made clear yet again that terrorism tends to originate in authoritarian countries, not democracies. An unaccountable authoritarian regime, driven by nationalism and equipped with nuclear weapons? That should worry even the world's only superpower. 
So as Mr. Bush sees the sights with Mr. Putin, I hope he'll keep in mind a bit of Russian history that will receive scant mention during the jubilee. St. Petersburg might have been created as a window to the West, but it was built on the bones of tens of thousands of serfs who perished while raising it out of the swamp. If Mr. Bush is truly a good friend, he should look Mr. Putin in the eye again and ask him which St. Petersburg he wants to build.

HEADLINE: A Russia Resurgent 

BYLINE:  By Anders Aslund; Anders Aslund, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is author of "Building Capitalism: The Transformation of the Former Soviet Bloc."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Last month Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain traveled to Moscow to discuss postwar Iraq with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Although the war was effectively over, Mr. Putin remained skeptical of its aims. "Where is Saddam?" Mr. Putin asked at a press conference after the meeting. Where, he continued, were the weapons of mass destruction, "if they really existed?"
 This weekend, President Bush is scheduled to meet with Mr. Putin in St. Petersburg. He might face a similarly rude awakening. 
 On 9/11, President Putin was among the first foreign leaders to phone President Bush. During the war against Afghanistan, he allowed United States military planes to fly over Russian territory, accepted American bases in Central Asia, and shared intelligence in spite of strong opposition from the former Soviet security establishment.
The Bush administration responded by accepting that the Chechen resistance was linked to international terrorism -- but that was it. President Bush promised to work to persuade Congress to revoke the obsolete Jackson-Vanik legislation, which threatens economic sanctions against Russia because of emigration policies not followed since the Soviet era, but so far he has failed. In the year following the attacks of 9/11, the Bush administration abandoned the ABM treaty with Russia and then supported the enlargement of NATO.
Mr. Putin accepted these decisions graciously, but he received nothing in return. In the Russian debate, he was increasingly compared with the hapless Mikhail Gorbachev, who was said always to have given in to the Americans without getting anything.
As the war in Iraq approached, Russia initially took a back seat. While not supporting Saddam Hussein, it wanted to secure some commercial interests in Iraq, like oil concessions, financial claims and trade contracts. But Russia enjoyed too little attention from the United States. In the first quarter of this year, no government official more senior than an under secretary of state visited Moscow.
Meanwhile, public opinion in Russia, as in Germany and France, evolved against the war. The Russian Communist Party benefited -- a fact that Mr. Putin, an avid reader of opinion polls, could not ignore in an election year. With no results to show from his pro-American policy, he joined the French-German position against the war. (Besides, Germany is twice as large an export market for Russia as the United States.)
So where does this leave American-Russian relations on the eve of the summit meeting? The scales of influence, if not the balance of power, have shifted.
The United States has relatively little to offer Mr. Putin. After years of discussion about American-Russian energy development, the Russian oil sector is doing well on its own. Russia's attempt to enter the World Trade Organization has, unfortunately, encountered domestic resistance and no longer tops the meeting's agenda. And after four years of annual economic growth averaging about 6 percent, the Russian economy requires no financial aid.
Russia, in contrast, has gained some leverage. As one of Iraq's main creditors, Russia belongs to the so-called Paris Club, which renegotiates government debt of countries in default. For Iraq to recover quickly, its debt of about $380 billion must be reduced by about three-quarters. But Russia, which never got any debt forgiven itself, is reluctant to grant such relief and could complicate international financing of Iraq's recovery.
Russia's export of nuclear technology to Iran could also prove challenging for the United States. The United States has long tried to persuade Russia to stop the practice. Russia has refused, partly because it would hurt its nuclear industry and partly because it sees Iran as the most predictable and reasonable country in the region.
Still, President Putin has no interest in a bad relationship. In his speech to the nation on May 16, he emphasized Russia's opposition to terrorism and to weapons of mass destruction as two key principles of Russian foreign policy. Clearly, there are issues on which Russia and the United States can cooperate -- North Korea, for example. And both the United States Senate and the Russian Duma have ratified the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, which requires both countries to reduce their nuclear weapons.
Economically, Russia also has much to offer. A scramble is under way for Russia's large undervalued private oil companies, and American oil companies may want to participate in a major venture. Increasing its imports of Russian oil will also benefit United States foreign policy.
For much of the last decade, the United States was able to dictate the terms of its relations with Russia. The war against Iraq showed that Russia can resist America's demands -- and that it can be strengthened in the process. It is this strength that Mr. Bush will meet in St. Petersburg.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Delay Summit Talks With Israelis for a Day 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 27 

 BODY:
Israeli and Palestinian leaders today postponed a summit meeting for at least a day, while Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, came under renewed criticism from Israeli politicians and officials for referring to Israel's "occupation" of the West Bank and Gaza, a term the Israeli government has long avoided.
 It was also a day of violence as Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian youths in three West Bank locations, killing a teenager and wounding at least five boys age 14 or younger, Palestinians said. 
 Mr. Sharon and the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, had planned to hold talks on Wednesday. But the meeting was postponed because of Mr. Abbas's scheduling difficulties, according to the Palestinian information minister, Nabil Amr. 
The delay was not described as serious by either side, and aides were trying to reschedule the talks, possibly for Thursday.
The meeting would be the second between the two leaders in two weeks, and is seen as important for sustaining the current diplomatic momentum on the Middle East peace plan, called the road map.
The meeting is also expected to help set the stage for a summit meeting that would include the two leaders and President Bush. That gathering looks likely to take place next week in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba in Jordan, according to diplomats.
In addition, President Bush is expected to hold a separate meeting in Egypt with Arab leaders, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported. It would precede his meeting with Mr. Sharon and Mr. Abbas.
Mr. Sharon, Israel's most prominent hawk, spent the day fending off right-wing critics following his recent comments and the cabinet's decision on Sunday to give conditional support to the peace plan.
Mr. Sharon argued on Sunday that Israel had no real option but to accept the measures outlined in the peace plan. After a stormy session, the cabinet voted 12 to 7 in favor, with 4 abstentions. 
The cabinet also expressed Israel's many reservations about the plan, which could complicate efforts to put it into effect.
The Palestinians maintain that the plan, drawn up by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia, must be implemented as is, fearing that attempts to rework it will lead to long delays, and ultimately to failure.
On Monday Prime Minister Sharon told members of his right-wing Likud party, "You may not like the word, but what's happening is occupation." 
"Holding 3.5 million Palestinians is a bad thing for Israel, for the Palestinians and for the Israeli economy," he said.
Today Mr. Sharon qualified his remarks, dropping the reference to "occupation," but did not retract them. 
"I meant it is undesirable for us to rule over a Palestinian population," Mr. Sharon told a parliamentary committee today. Aides hastened to add that the prime minister was not referring to all of the land of the West Bank and Gaza, where Israel has almost 150 Jewish settlements.
Israeli officials have long refrained from using the word "occupation," and refer to the West Bank and Gaza, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as "disputed territories."
Israel's attorney general, Elyakim Rubinstein, urged Mr. Sharon to avoid the terminology, saying it could harm Israel in international discussions on the issue.
The official Israeli position is that both Israel and the Palestinians have claims on the land, and the status needs to be negotiated. The Palestinians want all of the lands for a future state and are demanding an end to Israel's "military occupation."
"Israel has had a self-defeating tendency in the past to use the word 'occupation' regarding the West Bank and Gaza and thus undermine its own legal claims," said Dore Gold, an adviser to Mr. Sharon.
Meanwhile, Israeli troops were active in several parts of the West Bank.
Palestinian youths threw stones and gasoline bombs at soldiers, who fired back in the Tulkarm refugee camp, the army said. A 16-year-old boy was killed and a 7-year-old was injured, Palestinian witnesses and hospital officials said.
In similar confrontations in the town of Jenin and the village of Beit Furik, four Palestinian youths, ages 9 to 14, were wounded, Palestinians said. The Israeli Army confirmed the clashes but had no information on casualties.
In the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian militants fired three homemade rockets at the Israeli town of Sederot just across the border fence. No damage or injuries were reported.
In the Israeli Parliament, opposition lawmakers carried on with a filibuster for a second day to protest proposed government budget cuts.
On the streets outside Parliament, about 40,000 government and private sector workers protested planned changes in the pension system. The proposals include raising the retirement age to 67 for all, from the current age of 60 for women and 65 for men.
Jewish seminary students marched in downtown Jerusalem to protest cuts in their subsidies. A day earlier, thousands of Orthodox Jewish youths demonstrated against proposed cuts in subsidies to families.
A broad range of Israelis have been holding periodic strikes, protests and work slowdowns for the past two months, since the finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, proposed across-the-board spending reductions.
Mr. Netanyahu says Israel's economy, now in its third year of recession, cannot afford the current wide range of subsidies and social programs, some of which date back decades.
His plan calls for trimming the national budget by 11 billion shekels ($2.47 billion), or 4 percent overall.
Lawmakers opposed to the budget cuts have listed thousands of separate objections, according to Giora Pordes, the Parliament spokesman. But he predicted that a vote on the package would take place on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Greening of Lower Manhattan With $25 Million Grant to City 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
A carousel is planned for the Battery Park Bosque. A new park will spring from rutted asphalt at a bustling corner along Canal Street. Synthetic turf or natural grass will spread over concrete in several playgrounds. 
 In all, city officials announced yesterday, at least 13 green or recreational spaces south of Canal Street will get a makeover or be created under a $25 million grant to the city from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. 
 The parks improvements, which officials said were the most significant for the area in several decades, are part of $65 million in short-term projects the agency is taking over the next year to help bring about a revival of Lower Manhattan after the destruction of the World Trade Center. Other projects in the works include a pedestrian bridge over West Street at Vesey Street and a green market in Liberty Park Plaza that is scheduled to open next month.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the parks enhancements were central to the comeback of an area that, despite a surge of new residents, has suffered from a slowdown in business wrought by 9/11 and the weakened economy.
"The network of parks projects the city is undertaking will make Lower Manhattan a vibrant community and a worldwide destination," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference at the Battery Park Bosque. "They will also be tangible symbols of the rebirth of New York City."
Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, called the plan the most ambitious for the downtown area in more than 20 years.
"This is the biggest boon for Lower Manhattan since the creation of the Battery Park City parks more than two decades ago," Mr. Benepe said. "It is the first new green space in several decades."
The plan includes three new permanent parks rising out of existing roadbeds or asphalt space: Wall Street Triangle, near Wall Street and the South Street viaduct; Coenties Slip; and Canal/Laight Park at the intersection of Canal, Varick and Laight Streets.
Various improvements will be made at the following: Washington Market Park, TriBeCa Park, Old Slip, Brooklyn Bridge Plaza/Drumgoole Plaza, Bowling Green, Sara D. Roosevelt Park, Columbus Park, the Alfred E. Smith Playground and the ball fields at East River Park.
The largest improvements are planned for the Battery Park Bosque, a woodsy area close to the water at the southernmost part of the park. Aside from a carousel with an aquatic theme recalling the original locale of the New York Aquarium, the city plans to install ornamental gardens, a fountain and new lighting.
"This park will finally have the presence it deserves," Mr. Benepe said.
Most of the projects will be completed within 18 months; the East River ball fields may take up to two years.
The plan would not use money from the Parks Department, which, under Mr. Bloomberg's fiscal belt-tightening, is paring park cleaners and subsidies to zoos, among other cutbacks. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation funds come from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.

HEADLINE: Passion For Peace 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
For years I believed that when it came to Middle East peacemaking, America couldn't want peace more than the parties themselves. I no longer believe that. In fact, I now believe just the opposite. For there to be any progress, America must want peace more than the parties themselves -- in Israel and the West Bank, and in Iraq. And the question I have going forward is whether that will be the case with President Bush.
 First a word about Mr. Bush. He deserves a tip of the hat for having his principles right. His conviction that getting rid of Saddam Hussein was necessary to build a different Iraq and a different Middle East -- which are both critical for drying up terrorism -- was right. And his convictions that the Palestinians had to move beyond Yasir Arafat to a responsible leadership and that the Israelis hadto come to terms with the inevitability of a Palestinian state and an end to settlements, if there was to be any progress toward peace, are also right. 
 But -- you knew there was a "but" coming -- the question I always have about members of the Bush team is, How good are they at translating principles into practice? When it comes to breaking things they are very, very good -- whether it is the ABM treaty, the Kyoto accord, Afghanistan, Iraq or the old way of Arab-Israeli peacemaking. The Bush people believe in power and are not afraid to wield the wrecking ball. But how good are they with a hammer and a nail? How good are they at the detail work of building real alternatives -- to Kyoto, Saddam or the Arab-Israel peace process? This is still the most important unanswered question about this administration. Can it reap the harvest of the principles it has sown?
Don't get me wrong -- ultimately it is up to Israelis, Palestinians and Iraqis to liberate themselves. They have to want it. But at this stage, we have to use our power to help create the context for them to do it. And that is hard. It means taking hits politically and militarily, which is why if we are to do it right we really have to want it bad.
"In both Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict," says the Middle East expert Stephen Cohen, "there is such a struggle of wills within the competing parties, and between the competing parties, and the forces for and against change are so evenly balanced, that only a third party -- with a clear vision -- can swing things toward compromise. That is America's role. Also the parties themselves are always going to be focused on the immediate costs of doing something because the positive outcomes seem remote or even unlikely to them. Which is why they'll need our push."
In Iraq, it's still not clear to me how much the Bush team wants to do nation-building there. The Rumsfeld doctrine of small-force, high-tech armies may be great for winning wars, but you need the Powell doctrine for winning the peace: a massive, overwhelming investment of soldiers, police and aid. We should be flooding Iraq with people and money right now. Start big and then build down -- not the other way around. Ditto on the politics side. In destroying the Iraqi Army and Baath Party, we have destroyed the (warped) pillars of Iraqi secular nationalism. We need to start replacing them, quickly, with alternative, progressive pillars of Iraqi secular nationalism; otherwise, Shiite religious nationalism will fill the void.
We will have to do the same in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has said some remarkable and important things lately, most notably: "You may not like the word but what's happening is occupation. Holding 3.5 million Palestinians is a bad thing for Israel, for the Palestinians and for the Israeli economy." The newly elected Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, recently gave a talk detailing what a disaster the last two years of Palestinian uprising had been -- an uprising encouraged by Yasir Arafat.
But translating these changes in Israeli-Palestinian principles into real changes in quality of life, for both communities, will be a full-time job for the Bush team. Because for both Israelis and Palestinians, forging a two-state solution will require some level of civil war within each community -- between moderates and extremists.
And we should want that more than they do (or at least as much), because if we've learned anything since 9/11, it's that the spreading flames of Middle East conflicts have, in a world without walls, begun affecting our quality of life. Their madness has become our metal detectors -- and we've had enough of it.

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visit last week to President Bush's ranch in Texas was punctuated by an unannounced, last-minute surprise: Mr. Bush invited his house guest to sit in on his highly classified morning intelligence briefing, the daily global review of terrorist threats, loose nukes and brewing hot spots. 
 Just a few weeks before, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia got similar insider treatment at the ranch: he was given a precious seat at the table for Mr. Bush's strategy session with the American negotiators with North Korea. 
 Last week Mr. Bush pulled out all the stops for the president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo -- even enduring a formal news conference in the East Room, one of Mr. Bush's least favorite venues -- to make clear to her constituents half a world away that they would be rewarded for allowing the American military to pursue terrorists on their territory.
Such efforts to rebuild and reshape alliances -- and to make clear which foreign leaders are considered members of the Bush inner circle -- are part of an effort by the White House to compensate for the breaches with the traditional allies that became so visible during the war in Iraq.
While many presidents have usedprivate visits to Camp David and state dinners to impress and honor foreign leaders, Mr. Bush is taking the process a step further: since the fall of Baghdad, he has issued invitations to reward allies who have signed on to his view of the world -- and are willing to join him in the next steps of his plans to confront both terrorists and so-called rogue states.
Just as notable as who has been invited into the cozy intelligence reviews in Mr. Bush's living room, with its view of his private fishing pond, is the list of those not likely to be enjoying the view anytime soon. Mr. Bush will meet the leaders who led the opposition to the Iraq war at the annual Group of 8 summit meeting this weekend in Evian, France, where he is expected to spend as little one-on-one time as possible with President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany.
(Why France? "Let's say it wasn't the President's idea," one of Mr. Bush's senior diplomats deadpanned last week. "But they are the hosts this year, proving that the diplomatic gods have a sense of humor.")
Mr. Bush's aides insist he is not abandoning traditional allies, even if Secretary of State Colin L. Powell warned not long ago that France would have to face the "consequences" of its actions.
But clearly the highest honors have gone to those who sent in forces to aid in Iraq -- a short list that includes Britain, Australia and Poland. Mr. Howard received the highest compliment in the Bush lexicon: "you're kind of like a Texan." The next highest honor for countries is reserved for nations that have come around to share Mr. Bush's view that the only way to deal with terrorists and blackmailers is to confront them or, in the case of North Korea and Iran, to choke off economic interchange until they change their ways.
So Mrs. Arroyo's visit was intended to bolster a leader who is still facing considerable opposition at home to the idea that American forces would hunt down terrorists in a nation that was once an American colony. And Mr. Koizumi's treatment was intended to give some more spine to a nation still struggling to reconcile its post-World War II aversion to confrontations of any kind with modern threats on its borders.
Introducing Mr. Koizumi to the distinctly American ritual of a morning intelligence briefing was particularly notable, because Japan has just launched its first spy satellite, with lenses that will be focused intensely on North Korea's nuclear and missile sites. 
Whether all of this will work is anyone's guess. Mr. Bush first used the ranch near Crawford for diplomatic ends when he entertained Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jiang Zemin of China and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. In retrospect, Mr. Putin's visit was the high-water mark of United States-Russia relations: Mr. Bush's aides even taught Mr. Putin and his wife the country-western dance "The Cotton-Eyed Joe." 
Since then Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin have descended into rougher times -- first over Iraq, now over Russia's aid to Iran's nuclear program. Relations with the Saudi royal family -- Crown Prince Abdullah chose not to stay overnight at the ranch -- are clearly rocky as the royal family debates the risks of getting too close to the United States in its battle with terrorists.
(Prime Minister Tony Blair has been to the ranch, of course, as has another close ally, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain.)
"Bringing in Blair and Putin and Jiang and Abdullah was a clear signal that there is a new alignment," said James Steinberg, who arranged many a visit for foreign dignitaries when he served as deputy national security adviser for President Clinton. "Now, for almost everybody, the definition of being in the first rank of America's friends is an invitation to the ranch, because it is a place so special to the president," added Mr. Steinberg, now the vice president and director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution.
They also are part of an effort to build coalitions that the president will clearly need as he rolls out his post-Iraq plan -- a plan that starts in the Mideast, but also takes on the Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and a series of failing states, the future Afghanistans of the world. Mr. Bush is to take that plan on the road this week, in a trip that starts in Krakow, then moves on to a long planned observance of St. Petersburg's 300th birthday, then to the Evian meeting, and then, most likely, to Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt.
Mr. Bush, his aides say, has no illusions about the resistance he will encounter -- from Europeans still bitter about Iraq, Arabs deeply suspicious of Mr. Bush's Middle East road map, and many others still resentful of American power. 
But those who tell him they share his worldview -- or even those who suggest that, with time, they may think about sharing it -- could soon find themselves on the patio in Texas, being briefed about Al Qaeda in the morning and learning the "Cotton-Eyed Joe" under the stars.

HEADLINE: Putin's Sure Hand Abroad Belies Problems at Home 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 27 

 BODY:
When President Vladimir V. Putin meets President Bush in St. Petersburg on Saturday, more than a few questions will be asked about how Russia's steely leader opposed a hyperpower over the war in Iraq and came away unscathed. 
 The answer lies somewhere between Mr. Bush's evident personal regard for the Russian leader and Mr. Putin's skill in playing his hand on the world stage. Yet for all his stature abroad, Mr. Putin is looking increasingly vulnerable at home, facing growing fears that his dominance of the state machinery has peaked. 
 As parliamentary elections loom in December -- and the presidential vote follows next March -- the more important question may not be how Mr. Putin managed to go against the policy of Mr. Bush, but why he has been unable to face down the likes of Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the pugnacious former governor of the Primoriye Province on the Pacific in Russia's Far East. 
Early in Mr. Putin's rule, Mr. Nazdratenko tested the new president's vow to rebuild a strong Russian state and impose a "dictatorship of the law" over a society without rules. Back then, Mr. Nazdratenko headed a corrupt Primoriye government, which, many critics say, preyed on Russia's lucrative Pacific fishing industry. 
Mr. Putin fulminated, threatened Mr. Nazdratenko through aides with prosecution and, in 2001, removed him from office -- by appointing him fisheries minister. 
Two years later, the fisheries ministry is mired in a corruption scandal and savaged for mismanagement. This month, Mr. Putin finally got rid of Mr. Nazdratenko -- by making him deputy secretary of his national security council. 
Acerbic and decisive in public, able to hold his own with world leaders of all stripes, Mr. Putin has proven mystifyingly unable to marshal his global stature and his personal popularity to dispense with the Kremlin's Nazdratenkos, much less carry out the painful social changes he says Russia still needs to make. 
Three years into his rule, many experts have concluded that Mr. Putin's outward show of authority masks a careful balancing act among competing interests, from tycoons to political kingpins, who helped create his amazing success and benefit from it. 
In most democracies, there is a word for that: politics. But Russia's masses remain all but oblivious to how politics is played and policies are made. Who makes Russia's key domestic and foreign-policy decisions today is opaque even to experts, including American government analysts. 
"This system is not stable," Masha Lipman, a Moscow political journalist, said in a recent interview. "Its secret, the pivot of its stability, is Putin's popularity and the passivity of the public. The rest is warring interests, no matter how much Putin has tried to strengthen it." 
On its face, this is an odd time for doubts. Mr. Putin has won general acclaim for transforming Russia from skid row deadbeat to sober, even respected, nation-state. Public opinion polls routinely accord him the approval of 7 in 10 Russians, and he seems well set for another four-year term. 
This week's St. Petersburg festivities, ostensibly a glittering celebration of the city's 300th anniversary, are a barely disguised metaphor for Russia's re-emergence as a global force. The official laying on of hands comes next week in Evian, France, when the seven major industrial powers will grant Russia full membership and equal status. 
Moreover, thanks to the reordering that followed the 1998 crash of the ruble and to high oil prices Russia's economy has recorded five straight years of growth at a time of worldwide stagnation -- and Mr. Putin himself set a goal this month of doubling the country's gross domestic product within a decade. 
Mr. Putin's language remains as tough as ever. Not two weeks ago, in his annual address to Parliament, he recommitted himself to creating a "sustainable democracy where human, political and civil rights will be fully ensured," and suggested opening political party finances to public scrutiny and giving the Parliament a greater say in forming the government. 
The problem, analysts say, is with performance. After pushing a sweeping overhaul of the tax system and new legal codes through Parliament in his first two years, Mr. Putin has been unable to press much more of his economic and social revolution through a government he supposedly dominates. 
The problems begin in Chechnya, the breakaway province where Mr. Putin, then still prime minister, engaged in a war in 1999 that catapulted him to the presidency. Almost four years later, Chechnya has become a quagmire and a painful exposition of Russia's military shortcomings. Kremlin proposals to professionalize and shrink the armed forces are moving glacially, if at all. 
Banking reform, a linchpin of further economic growth, is moribund. Standard and Poors estimates that at least half of all loans in the Russian system are potentially problematic. Other experts say that no more than 15 Russian banks are true financial institutions, while the rest are essentially slush funds for conglomerates, much as before Russia's 1998 financial crisis. 
Reforms of the national gas and electricity monopolies have faltered, mostly due to opposition from big business or politicians who fear higher rates. Discussions on overhauling Russia's corrupt and bankrupt communal housing system have just begun. 
Mr. Putin's vow to slash into Russia's Gordian bureaucracy -- a major theme of his address to Parliament this month -- has been met, in echoes of similar Soviet-era schemes, by a government plan to wipe out 250 duties of government ministries and agencies. 
Some 4,750 others would remain intact. 
Liliya Shevtsova is a domestic political scholar at the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment whose new book, "Putin's Russia," analyzes the president's first three years. "I have an image of Putin sitting in the bunker constantly pressing buttons," she said in an interview, "and until recently, he didn't know that the bunker isn't connected to reality, that all the ties are cut." 
If that seems harsh, the growing consensus among outside analysts is that Mr. Putin is hardly the all-powerful figure his poll ratings and global reputation would suggest. 
Kremlin machinations are closely guarded. Yet it has become conventional wisdom that Mr. Putin remains somehow indebted to the group of tycoons and political kingpins who controlled President Boris N. Yeltsin's final years in office, and who presumably engineered his own swift rise to the presidency. 
Mr. Putin moved early in his rule to curb the broad influence those tycoons wielded under Mr. Yeltsin, and reached a grudging nonaggression pact with most of them in 2000. 
But key Yeltsin figures continue to hold important Kremlin jobs. The tycoons have reasserted themselves in Russia's 89 provinces, using their money and clout as major employers to wield effective control over politics in vast provinces like Krasnoyarsk and Chukotka. 
"Probably about a quarter of Russia's governors are to some extent involved in their business, and many governors are just agents of the oligarchs," said Rostislav Turkovsky, an economist and independent political consultant for the private Regional Studies Agency. "And if Putin wants to ensure that a certain governor is loyal, that means he has to go, not to the governor, but to the oligarch and talk with him." 
Mr. Putin, the experts say, has sought to offset those influences by peppering his government with trusted friends from Russia's intelligence and security services, where he spent his career before entering politics. 
But the principal effect, they say, may have been to give Russia's civil liberties and military policies an even more conservative cast. 
Always the targets of suspicion by the police and intelligence agents, foreign social activists and technical experts have come under renewed scrutiny and, in some cases, have been ejected from the country. The Peace Corps mission here was abruptly ended last year amid accusations that the young volunteers were spies. 
"Most people would agree that on the basic institutions of democracy, Putin has weakened Russia, not strengthened it," said Michael McFaul, an analyst with the Hoover Institution who is one of the leading scholars on post-Soviet Russia.
Among other glaring problems, Mr. McFaul lists the unequal rights granted ethnic Chechens, frequent rigged elections, harassment of social activists, the effective end of independent television networks and a shift away from direct elections to Parliament. 
But like many others, Mr. McFaul is reluctant to blame Mr. Putin for all that, or to declare the democratic experiment over. Rather, he said, it is stalled, waiting for a breeze to carry it either forward or back. 
"It's democracy by default, which is to say that they're not strong enough to have an autocracy," Mr. McFaul said in an interview. "It's like the vast majority of regimes which have gone into the transition from Communist rule. We always thought there was a continuum, from autocracy to democracy. But it turns out that you can get halfway there and just stagnate. And that's where Russia is."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: UNCONVENTIONAL WEAPONS; 
Rumsfeld Echoes Notion That Iraq Destroyed Arms

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld suggested publicly for the first time yesterday that Iraq might have destroyed chemical and biological weapons before the war there, a possibility that senior American officers in Iraq have raised in recent weeks.
 Mr. Rumsfeld has repeatedly expressed optimism that it is just a matter of time, and of interviewing enough senior Iraqi scientists and former government officials, before military teams uncover the illicit arms that President Bush cited as a major reason for attacking Iraq and toppling Saddam Hussein's rule. 
 While Mr. Rumsfeld repeated that assertion yesterday, he added, "It is also possible that they decided that they would destroy them prior to a conflict." Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, now in northern Iraq, mentioned the same possibility two weeks ago. 
Senior defense aides insisted that Mr. Rumsfeld's response to a question after his speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan yesterday broke no new ground, and that it was consistent with his past explanations.
He said the speed of the campaign might have prevented Iraq from using unconventional weapons. He added that military investigators had been searching in earnest for only seven weeks, that Iraqi weapons might be buried in one of several hundred uninspected sites and that investigators' best leads might come from Iraqi officials who have only recently surrendered or been captured.
"I don't know the answer," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "I suspect we'll learn a lot more as we go along and keep interrogating people."
But the fact that Mr. Rumsfeld even raised the possibility that Iraq might have destroyed unconventional weapons before the war prompts new questions about the intelligence that President Bush and his senior advisers relied on to go to war, and about the credibility of the United States, defense analysts said yesterday.
"They don't have a good explanation, and therefore are trying to come up with as long a list as possible," said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "But it's impossible to destroy or hide the quantities the administration said they had without our noticing it."
Mr. Bush, in an interview last month with NBC News, acknowledged, "there's going to be skepticism until people find out there was, in fact, a weapons of mass destruction program."
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Rumsfeld made no reference yesterday to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Instead, he sought to counter critics who have accused the administration of bungling the postwar phase of the military campaign in Iraq, and to appeal for patience for a reconstruction effort that will be difficult and bumpy at times.
"The transition to democracy will take time," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "Trial and error and experimentation will be a part of the process. The efforts will not be perfect. Course corrections will be needed. I'm sure they'll all be pointed to and viewed with alarm, but we'll survive that."
Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks seemed part of a public relations campaign of sorts. His speech echoed many of themes he outlined in an op-ed article published on Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal. Aides said he was to meet with The Journal's editorial board while in Manhattan.
The priorities Mr. Rumsfeld described coincide with recent steps by the administration's new civilian administrator for Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III.
These immediate goals include asserting the coalition's authority and providing security, steps Mr. Bremer has taken, along with increased military patrols in Baghdad to restore order and curb looting and lawlessness.
"The coalition is hiring and training Iraqi police, and will be prepared to use force to impose order, as required, because without order, little else is possible in any country," Mr. Rumsfeld said.
As fresh troops from the Army's First Armored Division take over for the war-weary Third Infantry Division in Baghdad, Mr. Rumsfeld said the coalition "will maintain as many security forces in Iraq as is necessary, and will keep them there for as long as is necessary."
Restoring basic services such as electricity and running water has proved more difficult that American engineers anticipated, but Mr. Rumsfeld said that "the power situation in Baghdad is improving, albeit slowly."
While Mr. Bremer has delayed establishing an interim civilian Iraqi authority, in part to provide better security and identify qualified representatives for the political body, Mr. Rumsfeld said the allies would move to install Iraqis who are not senior Baath Party members in ministry positions where possible.
The allies will promote a market economy for Iraq, he said, one that will be more diversified than the country's former economy that relied heavily on oil. That effort received a boost yesterday when the Treasury Department said it was lifting most of the remaining economic sanctions against Iraq.
"The Iraqi people have an historic opportunity to build a free and civil society," Mr. Rumsfeld said.
"If Iraqis, the Iraqi people, can take hold of their country, develop the institutions of self-government and claim their place as responsible members of the international community," he said, "then the world could well have a new model for a successful transition from tyranny to self-reliance, and indeed, a new ally in the global war on terror."

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Increase In Federal Borrowing 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Without comment or ceremony, President Bush signed a bill allowing a record $984 billion increase in the amount the federal government can borrow, to a record $7.4 trillion. The increased borrowing will enable the government to pay for the $350 billion economic stimulus package that the Republican-led Congress passed last week at Mr. Bush's behest.

HEADLINE: Again, Architecture Discovers Prefab 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG KELLOGG 

 BODY:
THE essential ingredient was a willing client. That was Nathan Wieler, 30, a former chief executive of an Internet company, who wanted a modular house but could not find one he liked. He and his fiancee, Ingrid Tung, also 30, a former mergers and acquisitions lawyer, planned to spend $200,000 on construction.
 The couple cut to the chase. They telephoned Allison Arieff after seeing "Prefab," a book she wrote with Bryan Burkhart (Gibbs M. Smith, 2002). Ms. Arieff, editor in chief of Dwell, a shelter magazine, had been hoping to organize an architecture contest for some time. And so she invited 16 architects to design attractive, economical and modern modular homes that would appeal to Mr. Wieler and Ms. Tung. 
 The designs would have to get the O.K. from four professional advisers Ms. Arieff had rounded up, including Joseph Rosa, the curator of architecture and design at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. But Mr. Wieler and Ms. Tung would have the final word.
On May 18, during the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, Ms. Arieff announced the winning design, by Joseph D. Tanney and Robert L. Luntz of Resolution: 4 Architecture, a New York firm, for the house for Mr. Wieler and Ms. Tung, who were married last Saturday. 
The exterior of the 2,260-square-foot house that the clients selected is wood; the roof is pitched. You could call it Costco Modern for the compact-S.U.V. set. Budgeted at $87 a square foot for the basic shell and interior finishes, it is contemporary architecture for people who think they cannot afford architects. On the other hand, on paper it doesn't look like a cheap house. And it has the curb appeal and expandability to appeal to a young couple in the suburbs. Mr. Wieler and Ms. Tung plan to build it on a wooded seven-acre site in Pittsboro, N.C., near Chapel Hill.
Most architects have abandoned American middle-class housing. And modular design, though often viewed as an economical solution, has sometimes met with disdain. But Ms. Arieff believes modular housing could transform and improve American domestic architecture.
Prefabrication has long fascinated architects. Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller both experimented with it, as did the Case Study House Program, begun in 1945 by Arts & Architecture, a small California magazine. Among the modernists who built Case Study houses were Richard Neutra, Eero Saarinen and Charles and Ray Eames.
The Arts & Architecture program, a landmark in the history of contemporary architecture, inspired Ms. Arieff. Among the architects she invited to enter the Dwell contest was Ralph Rapson, creator of a Case Study project that was never built. Mr. Rapson, working with Toby Rapson, his son, updated his 1945 design with a two-story central atrium. The couple liked it. "It seemed like a place to escape or entertain, without going outside," Ms. Tung said.
Collins & Turner Architects, a firm in Sydney, Australia, offered an elegant block of floor-to-ceiling glass that recalls the Eames Case Study House from 1949. It scored well, but presented the usual concerns associated with glass houses. "Even though we are out in the middle of nowhere, I like to have some sense of privacy," Ms. Tung said. "I was worried about feeling exposed." She also wondered if a sunscreen curtain, designed to hang outside the windows, would be impractical in the woods, where dead bugs accumulate and trees fall down during ice storms.
Craig Konyk, a Brooklyn architect known for futurism, designed a house that looked as if it belonged in the carport of the Death Star. It had a steel chassis, power windows, tinted glass, a moon roof and styling taken from the low, long body of a 1966 Pontiac Bonneville, he said.
Ms. Arieff described the winning design as belonging to a category dreamed up by Raymond Loewy, the industrial designer: most advanced, yet acceptable. "You can push the envelope so far, but people have a comfort level," she said.
Just as products placed by manufacturers in the original Case Study Houses made them into billboards for new appliances and materials after World War II, the Dwell home has a close relationship with sponsors. A window company has pledged to donate 44 windows clad in black aluminum and 10 sliding glass doors, which the architects estimate would cost $30,000. "We leveraged the windows," Mr. Tanney said.
Once the final plans are submitted to the manufacturer (which has not been chosen), the foundations will be poured. Walls and floors will be preassembled in sections on the factory floor. The winning architects will receive their standard fee for design and supervision of the prototype house, 15 percent of the construction budget.
Several developers want to market the winning design as a prefab product. Mr. Wieler, with no experience in the field, has said he would like to try. The architects in the contest are offering their designs for sale. And Dwell itself may sell plans. All 16 designs can be seen on the project's Web site, www.thedwellhome.com.

HEADLINE: Washington's Museums Are in Expansion Mode 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
Thanks to an infusion of federal and private money, some $2.4 billion in spending is in the works for new and revamped museums, theaters and other projects in and around the nation's capital.
 The grandest plans are taking shape at the Smithsonian Institution, the world's largest museum complex, which is adding two new museums -- the National Museum of the American Indian, on the National Mall, and an immense hangar-style addition to its popular National Air and Space Museum adjacent to Dulles International Airport in nearby Virginia. 
 Other parts of the Smithsonian are being overhauled, including the Patent Office Building, home to the National Portrait Gallery and the American Art Museum. The National Zoological Park is creating an area for endangered animals from Asia, and a children's farm, and the National Museum of American History is adding a huge transportation exhibition this year. The Smithsonian projects under way now total almost $1 billion in federal money. And in addition to the Smithsonian projects, the government is contributing $400 million to a $650 million renovation at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that includes a pedestrian plaza. 
"This is a vote of confidence in the city," said Lawrence Small, the head of the Smithsonian Institution. 
Other major projects include the Corcoran Art Gallery's $150 million new wing and the Phillips Collection's $22 million expansion of exhibition space for its 2,400 paintings. The Newseum, the museum of news, is relocating and tripling its space with a $400 million building half a block from the Mall. Not far away, Washington's first City Museum, costing $30 million, has just opened, and at least three theaters, including the nationally known Arena Stage, plan to expand.
The considerable investment in the capital's cultural institutions comes as state budgets for the arts are withering across the country and wealthy patrons and foundations are generally retrenching. 
Museums and other attractions nationwide are still suffering from a significant decline in visitors as the fear of terrorist attacks and less disposable income in a stagnant economy have tamped down tourist numbers. Even the Smithsonian, with its policy of free museum admission, suffers when numbers are down because it relies for some of its operating costs on money visitors spend at museum stores and restaurants; one-third of its 6,400-member staff, for example, are paid with this revenue, called business venture funds, and income is down this fiscal year. 
Attendance had been rising at the Smithsonian's 16 museums and the zoo until September 2001, when visitor numbers plummeted. Just as the tourist trade began to revive last fall, it was set back again by the combination of sniper attacks, a harsh winter and terrorism alerts. The tally for 2002 was 24.4 million, down from 31.1 million in 2000, which was the last "normal" year. Although it is too early to predict totals for 2003, numbers at the most-visited Air and Space Museum have picked up sharply -- one million in April 2003, compared with 641,000 in the same month a year ago. But totals for two other museums on the Mall, the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of Natural History, are down significantly. So far, both have registered one-third fewer visits this year than in the same period in 2002.
Against this backdrop, the enormous amount of private and public money being spent on arts expansion in the city is surprising -- but not to local arts supporters. 
"It's a coming of age," said Katherine Freshley, of the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation, which helps finance arts and theater groups in the Washington area.
"What is whirling around began long ago in quite a few cases," she said, referring to the years of planning for efforts like the new City Museum. "But it is coming together at the worst moment economically." 
Ellen Lovell, president of the Center for Arts and Culture, an independent group studying cultural issues, agreed that the "city is coming into its own as a major cultural capital," but questioned the expansion's viability.
"The big question is: Can they all raise the money in a time of economic and philanthropic downturn?" she said. "And, if they succeed, are they prepared for the increases in operating funds and maintenance that new facilities generate?"
Several museum leaders said they were mindful of the risks, but were still moving ahead. David C. Levy, president and director of the Corcoran, said the museum had already raised slightly more than half the money required to break ground on its new Frank Gehry addition and was going ahead with what he called "a very sexy project which is seen as being very important to architecture in this city." Construction is scheduled to start in 18 months if the money is sufficient by then. 
He said that a change in the leadership of the capital campaign did more harm to the Corcoran's plans than any decline in the economy or philanthropy. "Clearly the economy slowed down and people pulled in their horns," he said. "Everyone started in a period of euphoria, and now we are in a period of caution."
Washington's unique position as the home of major federal institutions has also helped stimulate the current expansion, said Robert Lynch, president of Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit group. He said that in a typical community about 10 percent of arts money comes from government sources. But in Washington, the Smithsonian itself is 75 percent federally financed.
The District of Columbia's government has also encouraged expansion, said Dorothy McSweeney, chairwoman of the district's Commission on Arts and Humanities, by easing zoning laws and helping with bond issues and other financing. 
Over the long term, however, government money for the arts in Washington has grown tighter, not more abundant. In 1989, Congress agreed to pay two-thirds of the American Indian museum's construction cost of $219 million, leaving museum officials to raise the rest privately. More than a decade later, in a tighter budgetary era, Congress is leaving more of the fund-raising to private groups and individuals. The new $309 million Air and Space Museum complex, for example, was built with private money (a first for the Smithsonian) and will support itself except for a limited number of federally paid staff salaries and some basic costs of running the building. 
Still, money concerns have not dampened the amount of construction and renovation, which is unprecedented in the Smithsonian's 157-year history, even eclipsing the expansions of the late 1960's and early 70's. Mr. Small ascribed this to the city's unique niche.
"The difference between Washington and any other city," he said in an interview in his office at the Smithsonian's historic Castle building, "is that Americans are making a pilgrimage to their capital, to the national repository of their historical and scientific heritage."

Teaching Youth to Start Worrying About the Bomb

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: HIROSHIMA, Japan 

 BODY:
After 18 years of almost daily lectures about surviving the atomic bomb dropped here on Aug. 6, 1945, Setsuko Iwamoto's stories to classrooms full of students have a finely limned quality about them, as smooth as pebbles in a creek.
 There is no straining for melodrama as the 71-year-old woman recounts how her skin seemed to melt and pour off her arms after the flash, or how whatever scraps of cloth that could be found were used by people to protect themselves from the black rain that fell afterward. 
 Stories of survival do not get much more compelling. But Ms. Iwamoto worries now, with Japan inching toward rearmament, that the spirit of Hiroshima and the moral power of her story are fading. 
Each year, she said, the stares of the students she faces from the podium grow blanker, just as their questions about the atomic bombing grow more stilted, appearing rehearsed rather than heartfelt.
"Just a few years ago, most schoolteachers had direct memories of the war," said Ms. Iwamoto, who said she was found to have cancer last year but appeared hale. "That's not the case at all anymore, though, and I wonder once this kind of lecture ends, how effectively the experience of war is taught.
"In my day we had trouble just surviving every day, whereas these days everyone in Japan is comfortable," Ms. Iwamoto added. "Children learn about war through manga comic books and think it is kind of cool. They have no particular sensation of Japan's defeat."
The profound shock of the Hiroshima bombing, and that of Nagasaki three days later, is widely credited not only with ending World War II, but with creating a strong emotional underpinning to Japan's official creed of nonviolence, consecrated in an American-drafted Constitution that faces increasingly strident calls for revision. 
Fears about Japan becoming increasingly blase about remembering the atomic bombings, though, are not limited to the survivors, or hibakusha, as they are known here.
Hiroshima's entire image and economy are linked to the horrendous final days of World War II, and city officials say visits by Japanese travelers are locked in a serious, long-term decline, broken only by a modest spike since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States.
Commissions have been formed to reverse the trend. A museum on the grounds of the Peace Park, near ground zero, has been expanded and modernized. In the hope of popularizing visits here, even a manga has been created -- to celebrate the memory of Sadako Sasaki, a 12-year-old who died of blood cancer years after the bombing.
"We are faced with the challenge of conveying this experience to the next generations," said Noriyuki Masuda, associate director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Association. "At some point we realized that what we had was a crisis involving young people's consciousness. We have been facing a change in attitudes and a decline of interest in Japan as a nation."
When Ms. Iwamoto completed her one-hour presentation to a lecture hall full of sixth graders who had come to Hiroshima on a field trip, five minutes were left for what was billed as a question and answer session. 
In lieu of a question, a young girl who appeared to have been chosen for her excellence in study walked nervously to the microphone and read a brief speech in the name of her class. "Why must there be war?" she said flatly, ending her comments with a wish for the lecturer's good health.
Asked if visits at a slightly older age might favor deeper thought, not to mention real questions, the girl's teacher, Keiko Tokunaga, demurred. "This is the age when children are just beginning to think about the world," she said, "and I think that it is the best time to introduce ideas like this. But this is just a start."
Out on the grand plaza of the Peace Park, where the famous atomic bomb dome sits, just a stone's throw across the Motoyasu River, one has trouble imagining that visits to the Hiroshima memorial grounds are in decline.
Over the course of a fine spring day, one group after another of uniformed students troops from the museum to the dome, typically laying wreaths and garlands of origami cranes by a statue of Miss Sasaki, the renowned 12-year-old bomb victim.
Foreign visitors, whose numbers have increased as those of Japanese have declined, are also constantly in evidence. This day, a group of volunteer greeters were excitedly awaiting the arrival of a group from Senegal, including the country's ambassador.
At the approach of an American journalist, a group of ninth graders from Tokyo was unfailingly polite, and even excited to be answering questions about their trip here. None had discussed the bombing, or Japan's long-fixed identity as a nation of peace, with their parents before coming. 
Nor did they have many ideas of how the war began or why it ended amid mushroom clouds and hundreds of thousands of instant casualties. "This was kind of an experiment, because it was the first atomic bombing," said Eiichiro Hiraka, a 14-year-old with a dream of becoming a professional baseball player. "Hiroshima was the perfect size for that."
A classmate, Kaoru Iwasaki, said she had studied World War II the year before but did not remember much. "I'm sorry, but I can't tell you why the war started," she said. Asked the same question, her friend Chisato Kajitani declared that she was not very interested in the subject. "I've never really thought about that question before," she said.

Three Proposals, and Big Decisions, Figure in Pier 40's Future

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
WITH none of the fanfare and little of the scrutiny attending plans for ground zero, a decision is to be made soon about a parcel that is almost as large and almost as important to the future of Lower Manhattan.
 At stake is Pier 40 on the Hudson River, at the foot of Houston Street, a three-level leviathan that opened 40 years ago to serve the Holland America Line. Covering 15 acres, only one acre less than the World Trade Center site, it is really more like a peninsula than a pier. 
 Also at stake is the tenuous balance between citywide and neighborhood needs along the ribbonlike Hudson River Park being constructed from Battery Place to 59th Street. Would-be developers of Pier 40 say they are trying to plan a complex that would draw enough people to generate revenue but not so many as to overwhelm -- and alienate -- communities whose support they need. 
Three competing proposals are before the board of the Hudson River Park Trust, which is charged with planning, designing, building, operating and maintaining the park. The board has a deadline of June 15 to choose among:
* River Green, a proposal by C & K Properties and the Durst Organization, both of Manhattan, to create a complex of 8 to 10 small museums and cultural institutions, television and film studios, shops and restaurants. Ball fields and small thematic gardens would fill the rooftop. The design, by Reichen & Robert of Paris, would preserve the old cargo-handling gantries.
* Hudson Oceanarium, a proposal by Jacoby Development of Atlanta and IDEA of Boston, to create an aquarium, shops, offices and four theaters. Ball fields, parkland and an all-weather soccer pavilion would fill the rooftop. Chermayeff, Sollogub & Poole, a Boston architectural firm, has designed a forest of masts up to 180 feet high with expanses of netting to provide shade and evoke sailing ships.
* Park on the Pier, a proposal by Robert Fagan, Abe Leser and Louis Stahl of Brooklyn for a home improvement superstore, smaller shops, restaurants and a farmers' market. Ball fields would fill the rooftop, though it could also be parkland. The architect is John Schimenti of Lynbrook, N.Y. 
A fourth proposal, by Forest City Ratner Companies, has been withdrawn.
The designated developer would lease Pier 40 for 30 years. All three teams plan to reuse the pier's existing superstructure, a sprawling square doughnut about 40 feet tall with sides nearly 800 feet long. They would gain extra floor area by filling in what is now a four-acre hole in the doughnut.
They would all use the roof to satisfy a requirement in state law that the amount of "passive and active public open space" on Pier 40 be no less than the equivalent of half of its 15-acre footprint.
Each proposal includes a great deal of parking -- no fewer than 2,000 spaces -- recognizing that for many neighbors, the scarcity of parking is as critical as the scarcity of parkland. About 2,000 vehicles are now parked at Pier 40, which has been operated since 1997 by Meir Cohen and Ben Korman of C & K Properties under a lease that runs through the end of this year.
LAST week, by a vote of 29 to 2, Community Board 2 in Greenwich Village recommended C & K and Durst as the long-term developers, provided, among other conditions, that they do not include a superstore, as they briefly proposed to do earlier this year.
The board's action is not binding on the Hudson River Park Trust, which is conducting its own evaluation of all three plans.
"We're giving them all equal weight and assessing the community's needs in making our decisions," Christopher Martin, vice president of the trust for marketing and public affairs, said yesterday.
Though it operates quietly, the 13-member board of the Hudson River Park Trust includes some well-known government officials, business and civic leaders and political contributors. Five members are appointed by the governor, five by the mayor and three by the Manhattan borough president.
Charles E. Dorkey III, a managing partner in the New York office of the Torys law firm, was recently named chairman by Gov. George E. Pataki. The vice chairman, appointed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding.
Other members are Adrian Benepe, Bernadette Castro, Erin M. Crotty, Franz S. Leichter, Georgette Mosbacher, Julie S. Nadel, Theodore Roosevelt IV, Joseph B. Rose, Henry J. Stern, Diana Taylor and Madelyn Wils.
New Yorkers may be forgiven for having lost track of Pier 40's future, since so many plans have been advanced over the years: 1,700 apartments, a new home for the flower market that was traditionally housed in the West 20's, a setting for a branch of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
Besides being used as a parking lot, the pier shed serves as a storage, distribution and sorting center. C & K has installed a soccer field on the roof and opened the walkway around the pier shed to the public.
One vestige of its romantic past is a 12-by-20-foot mural by Frank Nix showing the four vessels that sailed under the name Rotterdam and a map of Europe with Holland America's ports of call and a miscellany of national symbols: windmill, harp, Eiffel Tower and, for Belgium, the Atomium structure built in 1958, the same year that work began on Pier 40 and jetliners began crossing the Atlantic, dooming the pier as a passenger terminal even before it opened.

HEADLINE: Environmental Groups Gain As Companies Vote on Issues 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
Almost a quarter of the shareholders of the Southern Company, one of the nation's largest utilities, voted at the annual meeting today to require the company to analyze and report on the potential financial risks associated with its emissions of the pollutants that cause global warming.
 At the same time, shareholders of Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest oil company, meeting in Dallas, gave a similar level of support to several resolutions on environmental issues. One, which would require the company to report on how it would increase its investments in renewable energy, was backed by 21 percent of the shareholders, and another, on how it would respond to the risks of global warming, was supported by 22 percent. 
 No one expected any of these resolutions to win majority support. But they are a measure of the increasing intensity of shareholders' challenges to corporations to respond to environmental concerns. 
Spurred on by a coalition of environmental and religious groups, shareholders have filed 31 global warming resolutions with 23 companies in the United States this year and 5 in Canada. The companies include auto manufacturers, electric power companies and oil companies.
"It is a trend that I don't think is going to disappear," said Sister Barbara Aires, coordinator of corporate responsibility for the Sisters of Charity of St. Elizabeth in New Jersey, who introduced the resolution today at Southern's meeting in Georgia. "I think more institutional investors are looking for assessments of the triple bottom line -- social, environmental and financial -- not simply financial."
Last year, resolutions concerning global warming won about 18 percent of shareholders' support at a dozen or so companies, according to the United States Public Interest Research Group, which has helped organize efforts for the resolutions. This year, they have averaged more than 25 percent at more than twice the number of companies, the group said.
The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit group in Washington that advises institutions on proxy issues, was more cautious in interpreting the numbers. Its overall figures were lower because they included a low of 5.2 percent for a resolution at Citigroup, which finances energy ventures. That resolution called for Citigroup to review the effect of these financial ventures on climate.
Still, said Meg Voorhes, director of the center's social issues service, among electric utilities and oil and gas companies, the average support level was 22.6 percent in 2003, indicating investor concern about the risks that these companies face.
"In the 32-year history of shareholder activism on social issues," she said, "only board-diversity proposals have had average support levels topping 20 percent."
Last year, 9 percent of Southern's shareholders voted for a resolution to increase the company's commitment to renewable forms of energy to 20 percent of its portfolio by 2010.
"Obviously, we're way beyond that now," said Rebecca Stanfield, a lawyer with the research group. This year's measure, on the separate matter of financial risk but still perceived as a pro-environmental vote, received support from 23 percent of the shareholders.
"If it's any indication of their concern," said Ms. Stanfield, who spoke at the meeting, held outside Atlanta, "they treated us with kid gloves, shuttling us around and making sure we had coffee, anything we wanted."
"I think they're concerned" about where these resolutions are headed over the long term, she said.
Laura Varn, a Southern spokeswoman, said: "Any time a resolution comes before the annual meeting, it is something we take seriously."
She said, however, that the company was pleased that 77 percent of its shareholders agreed with the board that the resolution on financial risk would be of little benefit.
"The information that would be necessary to predict economic risk would be highly speculative and therefore unreliable to the investors," Ms. Varn said.
Still, Ms. Stanfield said the votes suggested the "increasing awareness that failure to address pollution issues can make a company vulnerable to changing regulatorylandscapes, liability for damages and poor public image."
Indeed, reports from Europe and the United Nations have estimated that changes in climate could cost the world $300 billion annually by 2050 from weather damage, pollution and industrial and agricultural losses.
The financial-risk resolution that was considered by Southern shareholders asked the board to submit a report to shareholders by August that would detail the economic risks to the company resulting from past, present and future emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury; report on the company's efforts to reduce these emissions; and detail the economic benefits of committing the company to a substantial reduction of emissions.
The resolution is identical to ones that were filed at four other major utilities this year: the American Electric Power Company, Excel Energy Inc., the TXU Corporation and the Cinergy Corporation. Along with Southern, they are the top five emitters of carbon dioxide in the country. Votes have been held so far at American Electric Power, where 27 percent of shareholders approved the resolution, and at TXU, where 24 percent approved.
Because the level of support at Southern was somewhat less than that, Ms. Varn was skeptical that the vote today indicated there was any forward movement for environmentalists.
"Ours came in at the low end," she said of the 23 percent. "They were hoping for more of an upswing so they could characterize it as growing momentum, but that wasn't the case."
While the managements of these companies have all opposed the resolutions, most have been endorsed by firms that advise institutional shareholders. The most successful so far was a global warming resolution earlier this year at ChevronTexaco, where 32 percent of shareholders voted in favor. This was more than three times the level of support that the last global warming resolution received at the company, which was 9.6 percent in 2001.
Ms. Voorhes of the Investor Responsibility Research Center said, "What we're seeing with these vote results creeping up is that people are saying maybe there is something to this idea that global climate change is a risk and the companies aren't preparing for it, they aren't discussing it forthrightly or in detail."

PERSON: Willard Goldsmith Rouse III 

HEADLINE: Willard G. Rouse III, 60, Dies; Shaped Philadelphia Skyline 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Willard Goldsmith Rouse III, a scion of a family of builders who built his own niche with Liberty Property Trust of Malvern, Pa., a real estate business that includes some of the most visible peaks of the Philadelphia skyline, died on Tuesday at his home in Phoenixville, Pa. He was 60.
 The cause was lung cancer, the company announced. 
 One of the country's 20 largest public real estate businesses, Liberty Property Trust has a portfolio that also covers an expanse of the Lehigh Valley, and properties as far away as California. As of the first of this year, it owned 652 properties, with more than 50 million square feet of industrial and office space. 
In May last year, Mr. Rouse commissioned the architect Robert A. M. Stern to design a $360 million, 746-foot-tall office building in Philadelphia called 1 Pennsylvania Plaza, planned to have 1.23 million square feet of rentable space; it is to be across the street from the Penn Center Suburban Station.
Mr. Rouse's uncle was James W. Rouse, who, with Mr. Rouse's father, Willard II, defined the shopping mall as America knows it today and left the family's mark with developments like Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston and the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. James Rouse died in 1996 and Willard II died in 1970. Their enterprise continues today as the Rouse Company, based in Columbia, Md.
Willard Rouse III came into his own in the 1970's when he founded Rouse & Associates, the predecessor to Liberty. He led it for 30 years until his illness forced his retirement as chief executive in January.
The 60-story 1 Liberty Place, built by Rouse & Associates, is, at 947 feet, the most prominent skyscraper in Philadelphia, the first to win the city's permission to exceed the height of City Hall. 
He was also a civic leader in Philadelphia, serving as chairman of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority and the Regional Performing Arts Center. He directed the development of the city's modern convention center and the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the new home of the Philadelphia Orchestra; he oversaw the opening of the center in December 2001.
Willard Rouse III, a native of Baltimore, was a 1966 graduate of the University of Virginia, where he majored in English. He did occasional jobs at the Rouse Company but decided to start a career elsewhere.
He was hired by the Great Southwest Corporation of Texas and worked in Dallas leasing speculative industrial buildings. In 1968 he joined the Bernguil Company of Los Angeles; while there he developed and marketed an industrial park in Gloucester County, N.J.
That undertaking, which resulted in the Mid-Atlantic Industrial Park, also brought him to Philadelphia. He and three associates founded a development company in 1972, Rouse & Associates.
The company reached out from southern New Jersey to the counties ringing Philadelphia, into the city's waterfront development, and on to Jacksonville, Fla. By 1990, it had holdings in Delaware; Harrisburg, Pa.; the Lehigh Valley; along the Eastern Seaboard; and in California. It reorganized into a real estate investment trust in 1994.
Mr. Rouse is survived by his wife, Susannah Dennison Rouse; eight children; three sisters; a brother; and two granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Next for Albany: Rents and the Environment 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 28 

 BODY:
For the first time since their bruising budget battle ended with a resounding defeat for Gov. George E. Pataki, the State Legislature's two leaders met with the governor today to set priorities for the rest of the legislative session.
 One issue they cannot ignore, all agreed, is whether to renew rent regulations. The laws are to expire on June 15, four days before all 212 lawmakers are scheduled to recess. 
 Like many legislative matters in the Capitol, a possible agreement on rent laws seemed far away today. That all three men -- Mr. Pataki; Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican Senate majority leader; and Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker -- even met was a significant event, since they had not sat down together in a month.
After the hourlong discussion, the three emerged, one at a time, and each outlined a series of issues that he said needed to be addressed, including environmental concerns, tough new criminal justice laws, antiterrorism proposals, insurance regulations, government reforms and economic development.
The leaders had no firm agreements to announce and, at times, seemed to voice opposing views about how to proceed on the same matters. But optimism seemed to be the mood of the day, in contrast to their often contentious dealings over this year's state budget, which ended with the Legislature's passing a $92.8 billion spending plan over the governor's objections and then quickly overriding his vetoes.
Specifically, the lawmakers and the governor agreed that one priority is cleaning the environment.
Environmentalists are pushing Albany to reauthorize the Superfund program, which helps clean toxic industrial sites, and to clean less polluted ones, known as brownfields, though differing bills exist in the Senate and the Assembly.
"We still don't have agreement, but staffs are going to be meeting and trying to see if we can resolve the differences," Mr. Pataki said of the brownfields issue.
Regarding a new state smoking ban, which takes effect on July 24, the governor and the legislative leaders were questioned by reporters about proposals that would weaken it by allowing people to light up in bars and restaurants that build stand-alone smoking rooms, or are operated by their owners.
Mr. Bruno defended the ban, but an aide later said he would be willing to consider ideas that did not undermine the intent of the law. Mr. Silver said he would consider very limited changes to help those who have made investments to conform to local bans around the sate. The governor repeated an assertion hemade when he signed the bill on March 26, saying he would consider "reasonable suggestions."
A priority for Mr. Silver this year is rent regulation. He wants not only to renew rent regulations, but also to kill a provision that has let landlords remove thousands of apartments from rent regulation. Mr. Bruno, who has said he regards the provision as one of his few victories in a battle with his Assembly opponents six years ago, would not comment specifically on the issue. Mr. Pataki said the current law, put in place in 1997, "has worked very well."
There are other issues that the leaders cannot avoid, said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. For instance, certain auto insurance laws are due to expire this year, he said, and the high cost of auto insurance will continue to exert pressure on lawmakers.

Free Food Taking Place Of Welfare

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT the city, charitable food programs are reporting higher numbers of people seeking help as tough economic times continue. The patrons of food pantries and kitchens are routinely called "the hungry," and some are. But a close examination of the system shows that it serves as an essential source of income for most, a substitute -- only a partial one, critics say -- for cuts in welfare grants and restrictions on food stamps.
 "We are supplementing people's budgets," said Sister Mary Alice Hannan, executive director of Part of the Solution in the Bronx, which provides hot meals in its food kitchen and groceries in its food pantry. "Because of unemployment and poor employment and the rising cost of everything, there is just not enough. When you feed people, you are giving them a monetary cushion." 
 The numbers in her program's food kitchen, which serves hot meals, are not only growing but changing, to include more families with children.
People like Mary Morris, who visits the kitchen often with herson, Isaiah, 2, and sometimes her husband, a hospital worker who was out of work for a while and has trouble paying the monthly rent of $720. 
"We need this," Ms. Morris said one recent evening, helping Isaiah finish his chicken dinner at one of the six tables in the food kitchen on Webster Avenue, a bright room that could be a small restaurant except that people are eating with plastic forks and moving in and out every 15 minutes or so.
Jose Padia, 53, who lost his job as a security guard a month ago and cannot make do on public assistance, is another regular. "I come here twice a day, every day, but if I get a job I won't have to come here," he said.
Most food kitchens are open to all and tend to attract the neediest; they used to be almost uniformly single men, often with substance abuse problems, but more families are turning up. Part of the Solution had to buy some highchairs and booster seats. Food pantries generally have modest requirements that people validate the size of their families and that they have a kitchen at home. Most pantries give people nine meals for each member of the family a month, though some can accommodate more frequent visits.
The Yorkville Common Pantry, on 109th Street in East Harlem, is a large operation that allows weekly visits. The program is popular and well known in the neighborhood. It is a routine destination for many of the people who stood along 109th Street with shopping carts last Friday just before the doors opened at 11, holding numbers they had picked up earlier.
"I came at 9, got No. 73," said Marcella Rosario, 68, a widow with grown children, who has been coming to the pantry every Thursday for slightly more than a year. It supplements her Social Security, she explained. "It helps you out, eases the pain."
Anna Febus, 62, who retired three years ago from a clerical job last fall, agreed, "It saves you money, to spend on other things."
If the Yorkville pantry disappeared she would have to find another, said Francisca, 30 and a mother of two. She lost her restaurant job and as an illegal immigrant cannot find a job other than cleaning an apartment once a week. Her cousin Eduardo, 23, just arrived in New York from Mexico last month and has no work. Francisca says she gets some government assistance but finds it hard to make ends meet, so the pantry's food will help.
SAME for a young woman named Michelle, a mother of four who was waiting for food at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on West 86th Street, and lost her job in the garment center after Sept. 11. She and her children have not gone hungry, but the pantry food helps stretch the family budget, she explained.
Most of the food in the city's 967 pantries and kitchens comes from the federal government, distributed through the Food Bank for New York City.
An average grocery bag includes staples like powdered milk and cereal, and an assortment that reflects national surpluses and market failures. The city's food bank is now distributing raisins because of a national raisin glut, for instance, and emu, an ostrichlike bird that did not sell in stores.
Whatever she gets, the Yorkville pantry's food will free up money for necessities like soap and paper, said Millie Serrano, in the 109th Street line. "There are six of us: me, my father, my mother, sister, her son, my boy," she said. "That's a lot of toilet paper. We need places like this."

HEADLINE: Surprise Jumps In Credit Rates Bring Scrutiny 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
The toughest diagnosis that Matthew Hajzl made last month was on his credit card statement.
 A doctor in Batavia, Ill., he discovered that the interest rate on his MasterCard had nearly tripled, to 16.99 percent from 6.2 percent. Dr. Hajzl asked the card issuer why, noting that he had always paid on time and kept within his credit limit. 
 The issuer, Bank One, replied that his creditworthiness had somehow changed and that it reserved the right to raise his rate accordingly. The culprit, Dr. Hajzl realized, was the mortgage on his new house. 
A provision now built into most card agreements allows the companies to reset anyone's interest rate based on the size and status of other debts. And improvements in information technology and a change in federal law have spurred card companies in the last couple of years to check their customers' data regularly, not only when they review applications or notice missed payments.
Concerned that consumers have not been adequately informed about the practice and that the sharp jumps in rates may be unreasonable, some federal and state legislators are proposing limits.
"Such practices increase the cycle of indebtedness, poison customer relations and spur bankruptcies that hurt borrowers and creditors," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York.
Congress needs to decide by the end of the year whether to reaffirm a crucial section of the federal law governing the use of personal credit reports by lenders. Some lawmakers would like to give states more power to restrict rate changes, and others want to limit how companies can use a person's credit information. Hearings began this month and are to continue this summer.
Ms. Maloney and another member of Congress, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, say they each plan to introduce legislation restricting rate increases.
A few states, including California and New York, are also considering measures that would limit lenders' access to credit information or require additional disclosure before they could change someone's rate.
Card companies say they are taking prudent action to increase the rates of cardholders who show signs of financial strain. They still look mainly at customers' payment records with them, they say, but add that the sophistication of today's credit reports -- consumer profiles that incorporate data from several lenders -- also allows them to change rates based on other factors.
So if someone misses payments on an American Express card, the interest rate on his or her Citibank card balance may jump. To a lesser extent, taking out a car loan or mortgage, or applying for other credit cards, can set off a rate increase because a new loan can stretch a borrower's ability to repay debts.
Three out of four card companies now use credit reports to reconsider cardholders' revolving interest rates, industry experts said. Those who do include some of the biggest card issuers, like J. P. Morgan Chase, American Express, MBNA and Capital One. And the card companies say they are checking on their customers more often, sometimes every month. 
"It's an industry standard now," said Robert Hammer, chairman of R. K. Hammer Investment Bankers, a consulting firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif., whose clients include 15 of the 20 biggest card-issuing banks. 
While each credit card issuer decides which factors warrant a rate change, virtually all companies keep tabs on a cardholder's credit score, the single number calculated to represent the information in a credit report. The score ranges from 300 to 850, with higher numbers designating more creditworthiness.
That may alert them to customers like Jim Voyles of Chico, Calif. Mr. Voyles, 40, acknowledges that he has made late payments and pushed the spending limits on some of his credit cards over the last few years.
Still, when Providian Financial last year raised his interest rate to 29.99 percent from 19.99 percent based on a low credit score, he considered the size of the increase excessive, especially given his clean record with Providian.
"Out of all my credit cards, Providian was one that I never was late for," he said. "Now, I am in bankruptcy, because -- 29 percent? Would you pay 29 percent?"
Providian declined to comment on Mr. Voyles's account. Like other card issuers, it said that raising rates was a way to compensate for the money it would probably lose to customers with weakening credit. 
Many card companies note that auto insurers raise the rates of drivers cited for speeding because those drivers are deemed more likely to have accidents and require big payouts.
Similarly, customers with black marks on other credit cards are more likely to default, card companies said, and should pay more. "We have to price for the risk that we take," said Alan Elias, a spokesman for Providian, based in San Francisco. "If a customer is maxing out their credit cards with other lenders or showing other signs of overreaching, the risk models tell you that it's only a matter of time before that's going to impact you as a company."
Mr. Elias added that Providian had recently lowered the rates of thousands of customers who maintained spotless credit records.
Bank One, Dr. Hajzl's card company, said that card issuers were tweaking interest rates more regularly because they had become better at customizing rates to reflect a customer's creditworthiness.
While Bank One declined to comment on individual clients, it said that when reviewing a cardholder's other debts, which it does every month, it looked primarily at the appetite for credit. "That is an indication of the future," said Ronald Robine, an executive vice president of Bank One Card Services.
Critics argue that the card companies' pricing policy is inadequately disclosed and often punishes cardholders for minor lapses. The practices receive only brief and vague mention in the agreements sent with new cards, they said. Although card issuers say they alert customers before imposing higher rates, the cardholders interviewed for this article said they received no advance notice.
These cardholders also questioned the logic of resetting their rates, saying it only put them further into debt. "What is that going to solve? Besides me paying them more interest? Or push me into bankruptcy?" said a 33-year-old financial adviser from New York, who asked that his name be withheld because he thought that divulging his credit troubles would hurt his business. 
He said the interest rate on his Bank One card shot up to 25.99 percent from 13.99 percent earlier this year, after he applied for new credit cards. "My debt hasn't been increasing," he said, adding, "But they assumed I was a bigger risk based on a mathematical model, I guess."
Many consumers say they are confused over the card companies' criteria. Charlene Marden, of Laconia, N.H., said the rate on her GM Visa card rose in March to 23.99 percent from 13.99 percent because she had enrolled in a program to manage her debts. Since last July, Ms. Marden, a single mother supporting two teenage children, has sent monthly payments to a credit service that in turn pays six creditors on her behalf. She said she would have juggled the payments herself if she had known the move would make her seem riskier and lead to a rate increase. 
"I haven't missed any payments," said Ms. Marden, 44, a nursing home aide. "I haven't been late -- ever. This doesn't make any sense." HSBC, which is acquiring the company that issued Ms. Marden's card, said it could not comment on individual customers.
The companies' reliance on credit reports also worries consumer groups because the reports can be inaccurate. Last year, the Consumer Federation of America analyzed half a million consumer credit profiles and found significant discrepancies in how different reporting agencies scored a third of them. 
The card industry's use of credit reports is under review because a crucial provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act expires this year. Since 1996, the provision has barred states from enacting tougher versions of the federal law, and Congress's deliberations on whether to make this provision permanent could open another important section to revision, legislative advisers said. This other section, also written in 1996, allows card issuers to review their customers' accounts regularly.
The card industry says the existing law has made credit accessible to more people, and lenders have begun advertising and lobbying campaigns to preserve it. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has testified in favor of it.
Consumer advocates concede that lenders should be allowed to see how their customers manage other debts, but they argue that some card companies are abusing that by sharply raising rates.
"This really is an outrageous gimmick to jack card companies' profits up," said Representative Sanders, an Independent and the ranking minority member of the House subcommittee holding hearings to review the law. "Certainly this is an issue that I and other pro-consumer members of Congress are raising."
He added, "What you want for the Fair Credit Reporting Act is strong national protection.' 
Mr. Sanders, like Ms. Maloney, is drafting a bill to prohibit card companies from considering information from other lenders when resetting their rates. 
In addition, states are considering privacy measures that could restrict card companies' access to their customers' credit reports. Proposed legislation in New York seeks to give consumers more control over their credit reports and would require the lenders to warn their customers before taking adverse action. A bill in California would penalize any lender that provided inaccurate information to the agencies that compile credit reports.
Supporters say such regulations would make it much harder for card companies to raise rates based on their customers' other debts. 
In many states, cardholders who experience unexpected rate increases can close accounts and pay off their balances at the original rates.
Whatever the law, consumer advocates said that the card companies' approach means that consumers will have to know their credit scores and keep track of their credit reports.
"And I'm not sure everybody's prepared to do it," said Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman for Consumer Action, a San Francisco education and advocacy group. "It takes some understanding. There's just a total re-education needed here for people."
Earlier this month, at a lunch in San Mateo, Calif., for retired public employees, Ms. Sherry asked, "How many people know what they weigh?" 
All 100 or so in attendance raised their hands. 
"How many people know their credit score?"
Not one.

HEADLINE: In Insurance Cost, Woes for Doctors and Women 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, Wash. 

 BODY:
Shannon Minor went to the drugstore last year to buy a home pregnancy test, picked up the local newspaper and read some bad news: her obstetrician, Barbara Pringle, was planning to stop delivering babies.
 But not only was Dr. Pringle giving up obstetrics, so were four other doctors in Mount Vernon, including Dr. Pringle's husband, Robert, and the Pringles' longtime partner. Within a year only four obstetricians would be practicing in Mount Vernon, a small city in an agricultural valley of the Cascade Mountains, halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border. 
 "I was so upset about it," said Ms. Minor, 35, who found a doctor at a hospital in Everett, Wash., 34 miles north of here. "There were hardly any doctors available. When I got pregnant a second time, I just felt lost." 
Ms. Minor's obstetrician is one of hundreds around the country giving up delivering babies. They cite the soaring cost of malpractice insurance. Here in Washington, rates have more than tripled since 1975, even after accounting for inflation, according to figures from Physicians Insurance, the state's largest insurer of doctors. 
The Pringles calculated that the annual cost of policies that would cover them for claims of up to $2 million -- the median jury award in lawsuits related to childbirth -- was about the same as the income they would lose by giving up obstetrics.
Medical malpractice insurance rates have been rising rapidly for several years, and multimillion-dollar awards against doctors have increased, putting pressure on hospitals and medical specialists and prompting calls for change. But in the last year, rates for obstetricians have risen particularly high, medical experts say, leading many to leave their practices. 
In rural areas, where there are already few obstetricians, it means pregnant women must scramble for a doctor. 
The Pringles said they had delivered about 4,000 babies in 20 years and had never been sued over problems in delivery. But the cost of doing business was not worth continuing, they said, and they decided to be part-time gynecologists instead. Their decision puts them at the center of a national debate overmedical malpractice insurance. 
President Bush and Republicans in Congress have used the plight of doctors to push for a law to cap jury awards. The House passed a bill in March that would have capped the awards for pain and suffering at $250,000, an amount that critics said was ridiculously low, given the possibilities for grave, lifelong harm from a doctor's mistakes.
But such a change in tort law has little support in the Senate. Opponents of the cap say supporters of the change are using obstetricians to exploit public sympathy and blaming the legal system rather than the real culprits: insurance and health care industries in need of overhaul. 
"There's a lot of fearmongering and overstating of the problem when you talk about ob-gyns, "said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the Center for Justice and Democracy, a consumer advocacy group in New York City that sent people injured by malpractice to Washington to lobby against the legislation.
But even opponents of a cap on awards acknowledge a serious problem with the availability of doctors like obstetricians.
"It's hard to overstate the problem," said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. "The problem is real, but I think it's simplistic to just say the only solution is the medical malpractice bill the House passed. That's where we go off track."
Caps, alone, Ms. Murray said, "have never been proven to bring down the insurance rates."
Ms. Murray added that she and two other senators were drafting a bill for federal aid for doctors facing higher insurance rates and lower Medicaid reimbursement. In a state like Washington, with a high unemployment rate, the number of patients without insurance compounds the problem, Ms. Murray said. 
No one has precise figures on how many of the roughly 40,000 obstetricians in the United States are leaving their practices, although several surveys are under way. Anecdotal evidence in the Pacific Northwest suggests that the numbers are rising rapidly. And it is easy to see why obstetricians would become symbols in a debate over malpractice insurance.
They pay among the highest insurance rates of doctors in the nation. In many states only neurologists and neurosurgeons pay more than obstetricians for malpractice insurance, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which recently released a survey calling the situation a crisis in 12 states, including Washington, and warning that similar crises were "brewing" in six other states. 
On average, obstetricians are sued two and a half times in their career, although they win a majority of the cases, legal and medical experts say.
In Washington, the average annual premium for obstetricians has risen to about $60,000 for a policy that covers up to $1 million of an individual claim or a total of $5 million for all claims, says Physicians Insurance, which insures 70 percent of the state's doctors. That is about 18 percent more than in 2002, when the rate was $51,000.
A policy covering a claim up to $2 million, or a total of $6 million in claims in a year, costs about $78,000, Physicians Insurance says. That was the coverage the Pringles were considering before they decided to drop out on Jan. 1, 2002.
The latest states that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has found to be in crisis, based on the number of doctors quitting practice, are Georgia, Ohio, Oregon and Virginia, joining a list that includes Florida, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington, with rural areas most deeply affected. The states where rising rates are a looming problem are Alabama, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Utah, the survey found.
"For everyone who's quit OB, there are 10 more that are on the fence right now," said Charles B. Hammond, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., and the immediate past president of the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Dr. Hammond added that if more specialists like the doctors trained to perform Caesarean sections and other procedures in complicated pregnancies left, injuries and problems could become even more common.
One doctor still on the fence about continuing to practice is Dr. Elizebeth Harmon, who has delivered babies in Salem, Ore., for 15 years. Last year, Dr. Harmon was sued for $6 million, after a patient lost a baby at full term. A jury awarded the patient $3.1 million, although that amount was later reduced in negotiations. 
"Things were really good in my practice," she said. "But your life can change radically overnight."
Dr. Harmon said her malpractice premium rose to $255,000 in 2003, from $28,000 before the lawsuit. "I'm working for free this year," she said.
She said she would decide within a few months whether to give up delivering babies.
For the Pringles the decision to quit was not easy. But as insurance rates soared, Medicaid reimbursement shrank; and about 60 percent of their patients were insured through Medicaid. The Pringles acknowledged that working part-time and leading lives that do not involve middle-of-the night telephone calls from women going into labor, or the fear of being sued, is a relief.
The Pringles' decision to stop delivering babies has been harder on the patients.
Ms. Minor, who delivered her baby girl, Jadey, by Caesarean section at the hospital in Everett four months ago, said she had a hard pregnancy. 
Once, she said, a nurse from the Everett clinic called at 5 p.m. on a Friday and told her that an ultrasound had detected a problem in the baby's heart. She wanted to see the doctor, but the nurse said she had to wait a few days. 
The baby was fine, but Ms. Minor said she missed being able to stop by the Pringles' office for a checkup on short notice. 
"For three months, I sat there and stressed and stressed and stressed," she said. "None of that would have happened at the Pringles'. I would not have been so scared. I would have had things explained to me. It was a rough haul."

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 29 about obstetricians who have left their practices because of the cost of malpractice insurance included an erroneous comparison from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In many states, only neurosurgeons -- not neurologists as well -- pay higher premiums than obstetricians. The article also misstated the location of Everett, Wash., where one expectant mother found a doctor after her obstetrician in Mount Vernon, Wash., stopped delivering babies. It is south of Mount Vernon, not north.

HEADLINE: State Oversight Urged as Way To Save Buffalo 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 28 

 BODY:
After years of teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, Buffalo is faced with having to turn over its financial operations to a state board that would oversee nearly all major city spending.
 The drastic prospect of a state financial control board taking over the finances of the city of nearly 300,000 was raised today by the state comptroller. Alan G. Hevesi, the comptroller, said that without such intervention, Buffalo and its schools could face a budget gap of between $93 million and $127 million in the 2006-2007 fiscal year. The overall budget for the city and its schools is currently about $925 million. 
 Buffalo, once a thriving, commercial hub for western New York, has experienced higher unemployment and seen residents leave the city in recent years, even during the boom of the late 1990's.
Each year, its government has spent more money than it has taken in, becoming dependent on state bailouts and borrowing to make ends meet.
The financial woes have become particularly acute in Buffalo's schools, which do not have independent taxing authority and must depend on the city for its revenue. About 1,400 positions -- or 28 percent of the district staff -- have been eliminated in three years. Buffalo schools have also talked about adopting a four-day week to save money, and the Buffalo Board of Education announced earlier this year that it would have to close at least two elementary schools and an alternative high school next month.
The proposal presented today by Mr. Hevesi was viewed by many Buffalo officials and residents as a lifeline for a city that has simply run out of financial options. While state aid to the city has more than doubled, to $103 million from $51 million, in less than a decade, state officials are now facing their own fiscal problems and have been less willing to bail out the city. 
Mr. Hevesi said that Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker, asked him to review the city's finances this month.
"The point is not to blame anyone," said Mr. Hevesi, who added that the board was intended to "correct these problems for the long-term and get everybody at the table who is a stake-holder, and who has power and authority to help make the decisions and share the responsibility."
The proposal, which must be approvedby Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature, would be the fifth time in state history that a financial control board has been created to oversee a city's finances. Similar financial control boards were put in place in New York City in 1975, in Yonkers in 1975 and again in 1984, and in Troy in 1994. In addition, the state also appointed a financial control board for Nassau County in 2000.
Under Mr. Hevesi's plan, the state would create a Buffalo Oversight and Recovery Board that would have to authorize any city expenditure of $50,000, or more, before the money could be disbursed. The bipartisan board, which would be chaired by Governor Pataki, would be made up of seven voting members, including Mr. Hevesi; Mr. Silver; Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader; and Anthony M. Masiello, Buffalo's mayor.
In addition, the financial control board would have five nonvoting members who would be drawn from the Buffalo city council and school board, the Erie County Legislature, and the business and labor communities. The board would review a four-year financial plan that would have to be submitted by Buffalo's mayor and its council; the board would also have access to the city's records.
In a written statement, Governor Pataki said today that he supports the idea of a financial control board for Buffalo, but he believed that its members should include more financial experts rather than elected officials. He pointed to Nassau's control board, saying that it "has succeeded because it placed politics aside and relied on the expertise of highly qualified financial experts."
Mr. Hevesi said that he stood by his proposed board, explaining that the situation was different because Nassau's economy was much stronger. "Buffalo needs a board that can agree to a recovery plan, including not just cuts and efficiencies, but also additional resources, and then make sure it is implemented," he said. "Elected officials, or their designees, have that power. Private individuals do not." 
Mr. Silver indicated his support today for a state board in Buffalo, and his aides said later that the speaker would be reviewing Mr. Hevesi's proposal with the Assembly members from that area. "I think there has to be something that brings the Buffalo finances under control, somebody has to overlook it," he said. "It is a situation that I think needs attention."
Mr. Bruno, who had not yet seen Mr. Hevesi's specific proposal, also said that a financial control board was probably needed in Buffalo, given that city's financial situation.
In Buffalo, Mayor Masiello held a news conference to pledge his support for the proposed state board, saying that it would provide him with "partners at the county, state and local level who have some real clout and can help give me the tools I need."
The mayor added: "We have an opportunity to get better, get healthier and deliver better services. It's going to take some pain and some tough love, but I'm up to the task."
The Erie County executive, Joel A. Giambra, who lives in Buffalo and previously served as the city comptroller, said that a state board was necessary because city leaders could not seem to solve the problem.
He blamed the city's financial crisis on the unwillingness of some of those leaders to make structural changes that would save money.
"They are more determined to throw money at the problem than to fix the problem," Mr. Giambra said. "That's a much easier solution, but it doesn't work. It hasn't worked in a decade." 
In the past month, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, which represents more than 3,500 businesses, has sent letters to the governor and state legislators, requesting that a financial control board be appointed as soon as possible for the city "with as many sharp teeth as possible." 
Andrew J. Rudnick, president of the partnership, said that Mr. Hevesi's conclusions about the city's dismal financial prospects confirmed what many of his members have known for months.
"This is a step," he said. "It needs some fine-tuning, but we should be focusing on just getting it done."

HEADLINE: Troops and Police Clash With Protesters as Unrest Grows in Peru 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru 

 BODY:
Soldiers fired into the air and police used tear gas and water hoses today in violent clashes across Peru with protesters who vowed to continue crippling strikes despite a government state of emergency.
 The police said at least seven farmers were wounded in Barranca, north of Lima, as soldiers fired shots to disperse rock-throwing protesters a day after President Alejandro Toledo imposed a 30-day state of emergency, banning strikers from the streets and giving the military and the police more powers to use force and conduct searches. 
 The police did not say how many people were arrested in the latest in a series of widespread protests by Peruvians demanding better pay and conditions. 
In the northern city of Chiclayo, security forces fired tear gas and arrested teachers, while shops in the jungle city of Huanuco were closed to avoid looting. In Lima, police in riot gear turned water hoses on protesting court workers at the national justice palace.
Health workers and farmers have, at least officially, temporarily called off strikes that disrupted highway transport with blockades of rocks and trees. But teachers, striking for more than two weeks demanding a raise of $60, to an average monthly wage of $200, said they were undeterred.
"The 100 sol ($29) raise they have offered us is insufficient," said Nilver Lopez, head of the Sutep union, which represents 280,000 teachers. "So we teachers have the right to keep expressing our unhappiness in the streets."
Earlier today, army troops backed by armored vehicles began clearing blocked highways. But the country's 1,500-mile Pan American Highway remained blocked in dozens of places by rocks and smoldering tires placed by angry farmers.
Thousands of travelers have been stranded since Monday as farmers sought to stop farm produce from getting to Lima and other cities.
Mr. Toledo declared the state of emergency on national television late Tuesday night, saying tolerance had its limit. "We have the responsibility to govern for 26 million Peruvians," he said. "We have the responsibility to protect citizens and the public order."
Mr. Toledo's two-year-old presidency has been marked by protests and a declining approval rating that now stands at 14 percent.
"One thing is democracy and another thing is the understanding that democracy means people can destroy the peace," Prime Minister Luis Solari told RPP radio.
Many Peruvians have complained that Toledo -- a former World Bank adviser -- has failed to fulfill ambitious promises of jobs, prosperity and a return to true democracy after the corrupt, hard-line rule of ex-President Alberto Fujimori.
Protests intensified in recent weeks with farmers, teachers, health and court workers pledging they would not give up on demands for wage rises and greater job security. 
Today, many schools appeared to remain empty despite a promise to reopen. "This isn't democracy. They send out soldiers as soon as they are unable to manage," said teacher Carmen Fajardo, 58, banging cymbals at a Lima school.
Mr. Toledo last declared a state of emergency in June 2002. That measure was limited to the city of Arequipa after three people were killed in protests there against the sale of two power firms.
Miguel Angel Bermudez, an analyst at private consultancy Maximixe in Lima, said the measure was a sign "of urgency, of the government's despair."

Delta Drops Burnett In Move to Cut Costs

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines in Atlanta is making significant changes in its advertising, dismissing the creative agency for its flagship Delta brand while making assignments for its new low-fare carrier, Song.
 Yesterday, Delta dismissed Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide division of the Publicis Groupe, which has handled creative duties on the Delta airline account since September 1999. 
 Most ad work for the Delta brand will now be handled internally, with help from BrightHouse in Atlanta, which has worked with Delta since August, to assist with creative and brand duties on a project basis.
Delta attributed the shift to "finding cost efficiencies."
The airline, like its competitors, has been struggling since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to cut spending as revenue falls and losses mount. Nina Avbee, executive vice president and group account director at Burnett, said the agency executives "entirely understand the pressures that Delta continues to face in this environment, and will do everything possible to make this a smooth transition."
Although billings for the Delta brand were not disclosed, ad spending in major media declined to $38 million last year from $57.1 million in 1999, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres. Starcome Worldwide in Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of Publicis, will continue to handle media buying for Delta.
Song is hiring on a project basis several divisions of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network in New York, including Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners for creative tasks; Media Kitchen for media services; and Lime Public Relations and Promotion for promotionalduties. Billings were estimated at $10 million to $12 million.

HEADLINE: A Better Class Of Competition 

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
A week before spring training ended, Jeremy Bonderman got the news that had seemed highly unlikely a few months earlier. He had made the Detroit Tigers' roster and would pitch the second game of the season.
 "You think it'd be O.K. if I went and called my dad?" Bonderman asked so earnestly that Bob Cluck, the Tigers' pitching coach, said he turned away as tears filled his own eyes. 
 Only two springs earlier, Bonderman was a junior in high school, pitching before several dozen fans and scouts in rural Washington State. Now, at age 20, after a season in Class A ball, he was headed for the big leagues. He still called his pitching coach Mister and wanted to know where he could get a sports coat required to ride the team charter. "I've never been to a big city," Bonderman confided to catcher Brandon Inge. 
Inge, sitting at his locker in the Tigers' clubhouse, said: "It's funny. A guy who's getting some wins in the big leagues can't even have a beer after the game."
Much attention has been paid to high school seniors who jump directly to professional basketball and to college athletes who leave school early to play for pay. But less has been said about another development: athletes who bypass their senior year of high school entirely and advance to college athletics or to the pros.
Bonderman, for example, became the first player selected in the baseball draft after his junior year of high school in June 2001. He skipped his senior year at Pasco High in Washington after receiving a G.E.D. certificate and turning 18, Major League Baseball's minimum age.
John David Booty, a quarterback from Shreveport, La., plans to graduate this summer and will skip his senior year at Evangel Christian Academy to enter the University of Southern California, where he will compete to replace Carson Palmer, last year's Heisman Trophy winner. 
Although the National Collegiate Athletic Association does not keep such records, Booty is believed to be the first Division I football player -- or at least the first prominent one -- to leave high school so early, football experts said. Another young athlete leaving high school early is Dana Hall, a 17-year-old soccer goalkeeper. She is graduating a year early from Kingwood High School in suburban Houston and will enter the University of Texas this fall. Coaches estimate that three or four of the best high school players in women's soccer take this accelerated route each year. The trend has included regulars on the United States national team like forwards Mia Hamm and Cindy Parlow and goalkeeper Siri Mullinix.
Supporters of early graduation say that athletes who take this path are highly motivated and disciplined and have matured faster than athletes in past decades because of their exposure to more sophisticated coaching and training methods and more advanced competition.
Those who question this athletic leapfrogging say that teenagers are missing a cherished year of high school and may be rushing into decisions -- or feeling pressure to make choices -- before they are physically and socially mature, and before they have explored a wider range of school choices.
Eligibility guidelines vary from sport to sport. For instance, athletes compete professionally at 14 in tennis and perform internationally at 15 in figure skating without having to meet any academic requirements. The N.C.A.A. requires collegiate athletes to be high school graduates who have taken a core curriculum of courses and have achieved a minimum grade point average and standardized test result based on a sliding scale. Major League Baseball has since closed the loophole that enabled Bonderman to be drafted as a junior; players must now exhaust their high school eligibility before entering the draft.
"We don't want to get into a situation of having people not complete their high school education," said Patrick Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball.
It is too early to know whether early departure from high school will become a widespread trend, either through established rules or court challenges to existing regulations, but for years sports administrators have confronted an invasion of younger athletes seeking scholarships, Olympic medals and professional paychecks. A year ago, LeBron James, the prep basketball phenom from Akron, Ohio, considered leaving high school after his junior year and challenging the National Basketball Association's requirement that American-born players remain ineligible until their high school classes graduate.
The N.C.A.A. said its membership was split on the growing practice of high school football players who graduate a semester early in the winter so they can attend spring football practice in college. As for athletes graduating an entire year early and skipping their senior seasons, "It is on our radar screen," Kevin Lennon, an N.C.A.A. vice president, said.
"If our membership found that young people were coming to campus at an increasing rate who were unprepared, it would respond," Lennon said. "But the numbers aren't there to put it as a top priority."
Still, even those who have benefited from early high school graduation caution that the decision needs thorough examination beforehand and sound advice from adults acting in the athlete's best interest.
"Do some serious soul searching whether you are ready," said Hamm, who is soccer's leading international scorer and one of the world's most recognized athletes. "It has to be more than one level -- athletically, academically and socially. If you're not ready, you're going to stumble."

Jeremy Bonderman
Riding a Fastball To the Majors
Detroit's plan this season for Jeremy Bonderman was to send him to Class AA ball in Erie, Pa. Baseball is littered with the ruined careers of young pitchers called up too quickly to the majors. "It's always a fine line," Tigers Manager Alan Trammell said. "Are you going to destroy a kid's confidence?"
And yet Trammell sensed a maturity and determination in Bonderman, a 6-foot-1, 210-pound right-hander, that belied his age. Perhaps it was the 95-mile-an-hour fastball, the wicked slider or the tattoo of a flaming baseball on his left biceps. In any case, there would be little pressure for Bonderman to succeed immediately with the Tigers, who own baseball's worst record and are on pace to lose more than 100 games this season. Perhaps Detroit could speed his development by keeping him in the big leagues.
Bob Cluck, the pitching coach, convinced Bonderman that he could gain accuracy on his fastball by slowing the speed slightly. And Cluck moved him to the left side of the rubber to better situate his slider. After two labored starts, Bonderman began to find his rhythm. By mid-May, he led American League rookies in strikeouts, even though his 2-7 record suggests that his control grows elusive, his pitches dipping and darting like a kite on the wind.
"We feel strongly that he is going to be a very good pitcher for a long time," Trammell said. "He's not polished, but we feel the staff is helping him along."
Pitching is all he ever wanted to do, Bonderman said. His pale skin does not hint at his outdoor life in the tiny farm town of Burbank, Wash., where he played baseball and hunted ducks and worked in the fields of potatoes, asparagus, alfalfa and corn. During his junior year, he dropped out of Pasco High School, took an exam to acquire his General Educational Development certificate, then re-entered school to play baseball that spring. He had played international baseball in the junior world championships and the Pan American Games. He had everything he wanted from high school ball and no interest in college.
"Something told me I needed to get out," he said recently in the dugout at Comerica Park, shifting his cap repeatedly on his shaved head as if signaling a runner on base. He had repeated fifth grade as he struggled with dyslexia, he said. All his friends were older than his classmates.
"I needed to take another step forward before I burned myself out playing at one level," he said.
Oakland drafted Bonderman in the first round of the 2001 draft and signed him to a $1.35 million bonus, then traded him last August to Detroit, which kept him in A ball. Last month, he got his first major league victory against the Athletics and their Cy Young award winner Barry Zito. Later, in Detroit, Zito praised Bonderman's pitching but said it "seemed pretty nutty" these days to go to professional baseball straight from high school instead of maturing in college first.
"I would never wish that on anyone," Zito said.
At the end of spring training, Bonderman talked with Al Kaline, the Hall of Fame outfielder who joined the Tigers right out of high school in 1953. Kaline said he had told Bonderman not to be intimidated by the hitters' reputations or their salaries.
The hardest part for him, Kaline said, was the loneliness of living in a hotel or an apartment and playing with guys who were years older. Bonderman alleviates the isolation by living with his fiancee, Amber Cox; they plan to marry in the off-season. Carlos Pena, the Tigers' 24-year-old first baseman, has also mentored him, taking him to the mall, to the bookstore, to dinner.
"The most horrible thing in the world is when you feel you are by yourself," Pena said. "Then you are left with your own demons."
The noise and the traffic and size of major league cities, Bonderman can do without. He would prefer to ride horses than planes and buses. Baseball is the same, though, in the city or the country.
"They turned this into a business, but when you're on the field it's a game," he said. "I'm living up to everything I've always wanted to be."
Cluck, a man of humor and patience, knows that this is a roll of the dice.
"Historically, taking high school pitchers is a very bad investment," Cluck said. Perhaps, he added, Bonderman will be one of the exceptions.

John David Booty
Skipping Off To Southern Cal
As he sat in the stands to watch Evangel Christian Academy's spring game on May 15, John David Booty said, it felt a little weird. He had planned to play in the scrimmage, then complete his senior season next fall before graduating in December and heading to Southern California next spring. Evangel Christian was loaded and would be seeking its ninth state championship since it began playing football in 1989.
In April, however, his father, Johnny, was fired as quarterbacks coach at the school, which is affiliated with the First Assembly of God church in Shreveport. Denny Duron, pastor of the church and chancellor of the school, told The Shreveport Times that the dismissal involved "a ministry matter." Johnny Booty had recently started a home ministry, which the church found threatening, he said in a telephone interview.
John David Booty then decided to forgo his senior year entirely. He will take an English course this summer to complete high school and will report to Southern Cal for the beginning of fall practice. "I felt like I was standing up for my dad and for what I want," he said.
At 18, Booty is apparently charting new football territory by graduating a year early. If anyone seems prepared, he does.
His father was an all-state quarterback at Woodlawn High School in Shreveport, where his predecessors were the future professionals Terry Bradshaw and Joe Ferguson. For 11 straight seasons, Johnny Booty coached all-state quarterbacks at Evangel Christian, including John David's brother, Josh, who is now a backup with the Cleveland Browns, and Brock Berlin, who is expected to start next season at the University of Miami.
At 6-3 and 200 pounds, John David Booty was considered by many the country's top prep quarterback prospect. He was held back in fifth grade to give his body an extra year to develop, a common practice in rabid football regions, and played varsity ball since seventh grade. In the last two seasons, he passed for 87 touchdowns.
"I told him not to make an emotional decision," his father said. "If he had not had older brothers and been exposed to this, I never would have let him do it. Because of his background and his winning two state championships, you want the kid to be challenged and pushed and find a new level."
Some recruiting experts believe Booty's decision will start at least a trickle of football players leaving high school a year early. But Joe Paterno of Penn State, the winningest major-college coach, said he had seen only a couple of players who seemed ready for college football after their junior years in high school.
Pete Carroll, the coach at Southern Cal, said N.C.A.A. rules prohibited him from speaking specifically about Booty until he arrives on campus. In general, Carroll said, these would be very rare cases, driven by families, not by coaches, who presumably prefer athletes to develop another year in high school.
"I don't think it is anything anyone would look for as an advantage," Carroll said.
Dennis Dunn, the coach at Evangel Christian, said he also hoped Booty's case would be an isolated one. Even his players who graduated a semester early had not found much benefit by arriving early in college, he said, noting also that early departures of elite athletes can disrupt the rosters of high school teams in numerous sports.
"We wish John David the best," Dunn said, but added, "I hate to see kids miss out on some of the purest and most exciting times of their lives, when it's not a business, it's still the love of a game."
Booty is already facing a number of questions tinged with skepticism. If he sits on the bench or redshirts next season, will he waste a year that could have been spent playing at Evangel Christian? If he left high school early, will he leave college early?
"If he goes there and stars, everyone will say, 'Great,"' Johnny Booty said. "If he doesn't they will say, 'I told you the kid was too young.' But he's ready academically and emotionally."

Dana Hall
Taking Soccer To a Higher Level
As with many top girls soccer players, Dana Hall was identified early as a star, joined a regional club team and the United States national under-17 team and traveled around the country and to Europe to play. In fact, she did not participate this year for her Kingwood High School team, which was considered lesser competition.
She had planned to graduate from high school next winter, a semester early, but reconsidered because she needed so few courses to complete the state requirements. This year, she took both junior and senior English, and she took correspondence courses this spring in physical education, government and economics. Instead of graduating a semester early, she will now finish high school a year early, and in the top 10 percent of her class, she said.
She will attend Texas in the fall and hopes to compete for a spot as the starting goalkeeper.
"I'm not getting challenged enough in my soccer environment," Hall said, explaining her reason for early graduation. She also said that she had become frustrated over having to go to detention on weekends for having missed 14 days of school this semester while on soccer trips.
"It's not fun chilling with delinquents," she said.
Accelerated graduation in women's soccer extends back at least to 1989, when Mia Hamm enrolled early at the University of North Carolina. Hamm's father was transferred to military duty in Italy, and Anson Dorrance, the North Carolina coach, became her temporary legal guardian. A number of players have since followed Hamm's path by arriving early at North Carolina, and the Tar Heels have become the sport's dominant team, winning 17 collegiate titles.
"Our experience has been very good," Dorrance said. "The kids who have joined us early have gone on to wonderful soccer careers. We've never had academic issues. These were well-adjusted kids."
Not all girls soccer stars have chosen to leave high school early, of course. Heather O'Reilly, the consensus top prep player, stayed through her senior year at East Brunswick High School in New Jersey and will attend North Carolina in the fall. "If it was going to be there a year later, why rush it?" she said.
Inevitably, early arrivals face adjustments, some jarring. Amy Steadman arrived at North Carolina a year and a half ago, leaving high school midway through her junior year. She was from tiny Brevard, N.C., and that first semester she had few friends outside soccer, became deeply upset when she received her first bad grades and, because of her youth, needed her parents' permission to participate in some psychology experiments.
A pair of knee injuries have kept Steadman from playing yet with the Tar Heels, though she is healthy now. The injuries, she said, made her realize that there was more to life than soccer and that happiness and friendships should be factored into the college experience.
Leaving high school midway through her junior year "might be a mistake, socially," Steadman said, adding that while she had no regrets, she would consider finishing her junior year if she could do it over again.
As players increasingly commit to colleges during their junior years, Bill Steffen, the women's soccer coach at Oregon, said some universities were pressuring athletes, giving them as little as two weeks to accept a scholarship offer. Steffen, a former assistant coach at North Carolina, has seen athletes excel after leaving high school early, but he said he generally did not recommend it.
The state of Texas, though, encourages early graduation, offering $1,000 scholarships to students as incentive, said Belinda Zoet, an assistant principal at Kingwood High School. While many students can benefit from completing four years of high school, she said, Hall seemed prepared for accelerated graduation.
"She's very mature, very goal-oriented," Zoet said.
Instead of participating in graduation on May 31, Hall will play in a soccer tournament.
"At graduation, you walk 100 feet across the stage and have one minute of fame," Hall said. "It's a lot more fun to play soccer."

Fan in Charge, if Only for a Day

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
WHEN Roger Farina landed his Army Chinook helicopter in Iraq during the recent conflict, he stepped out wearing the orange jacket of the Islanders, the team of his childhood. 
 For that example of extreme hockey loyalty, Farina was given the Seventh Man Award by the National Hockey League on Tuesday, just before the first game of the Stanley Cup finals. 
 His first proposal as commissioner for a day? Disbanding a certain blue-clad franchise based in Manhattan.
There are a lot of fanatics like Farina in a swath across North America, and this is their time of year. They remember televised Saturday night games in Canada, victory handshake lines, Stanley Cup parades. And in the days to come, fans in New Jersey and the nouveau frontier of Anaheim will make a pilgrimage to see the Stanley Cup glittering in public view. 
Roger Farina, a 36-year-old chief warrant officer, Grade 3, has shown his commitment to the Islanders by using two of his boyhood heroes for his daughters' middle names. There is Abigail Nystrom Farina, almost 3, and there is Allison Gillies Farina, almost 1. 
How did Farina accomplish naming two girls after stalwarts from the glorious past? 
"Because I'm in the military, all the benefits are in my name," he explained the other day. "My wife was in the delivery room and she was saying, 'No, no, no,' but I did it anyway. No, actually, she's Canadian. She's a good sport."
Jennifer Farina, from Ottawa, can understand her husband's love for this sport. He has not lived on Long Island for a number of years, but he has transported sticks, jerseys, photos and other Islanders memorabilia to his posts in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. He finds Islanders games on the Internet at all hours of the night and day, but his rule is that they must be live. Taped doesn't count. 
The earliest games Farina can remember were on television at his grandmother's house, where he watched with his older cousin Larry Wolfe and his best friend, Pat Tracey. He can remember where he was when the Islanders won their first of four Stanley Cups in 1980 on an overtime goal by Bobby Nystrom.
"I was outside, mowing the lawn, thanks to my father," Farina said. "You could hear everybody in the neighborhood beeping. Two years later, when they had a victory parade, my friend and I rode our bicycles down to Hempstead Turnpike, which we were not supposed to do."
He joined the Army after high school, and in 1991 he was flying a Cobra helicopter during the Desert Storm combat, "where I got most of my war stories," he said. Farina said he helped capture 500 prisoners of war, but he doesn't go into detail. 
While posted in Europe, he sought out international tournaments and looked up any hockey people from North America. A year ago in the Czech Republic he spotted Nystrom, who works with the Islanders.
"I showed him my daughter's birth certificate, and he started inching away from me," Farina said. "But after awhile he relaxed, and we went shopping together." 
Last year Farina met Clark Gillies, the strapping wing who had just been voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. When Gillies heard about the second daughter's middle name, he sent her a tiny Islanders jersey, having autographed it. 
The zeal of this pilot, serving his country in a war zone, won him the new N.H.L. Seventh Man Award. But Roger Farina did not merely show up to shake hands. On Tuesday, as commissioner for a day, he attended meetings and presented his concerns about hockey rules, traditions and economics. 
"It was more interactive than I would have thought," said Gary Bettman, the other commissioner. "He would say, 'I know I don't have the full story, but that's me, as a fan.' It was great to see somebody fighting for his country who says hockey is his passion."
One of Farina's proposals is to go back to the old personal names (Adams, Smythe, etc.) for the league's divisions rather than the recent use of generic geographic names. 
"There are two new divisions, so I would name one after Willie O'Ree," he said, referring to the first black player in the league, now a living icon. "And the other one I'd name after Al Arbour, the greatest coach in league history." Arbour, of course, coached the Islanders in their four Stanley Cup seasons.
At lunch, Farina got to sit near his old pal Nystrom and another former Islander, Jean Potvin. Later, he attended a news conference with Bettman and was proud to notice many of his concerns being raised by the hockey writers. 
When it was time to drop the ceremonial first puck before the Mighty Ducks-Devils opener, Farina wore a gift jersey, but then he lifted it to show his Army desert uniform. "The crowd went nuts," he said. 
Now Farina will fly back to duty in Iraq. "My 15 minutes of fame are over," he said. Bettman tried to tell him he was commissioner of all the teams, but Farina has put in a personal order for another Stanley Cup finals on Long Island, soon.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Pace Picks Up, Hinting of Broader Rebound 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
The first signs of a postwar pickup in consumer spending are emerging, reducing the chances that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates when it meets next month.
 Retail sales at chain stores rose last week at a faster pace than they had for most of the previous month, according to two surveys released today. In one survey, conducted by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, sales increased 3.1 percent compared with the week a year earlier, the biggest gain since January. 
 The chain-store numbers are among a handful of indicators receiving close attention from policy makers and investors because the data cover very recent economic activity. The indicators are more volatile than the best-known economic reports, like those on employment and retail sales. But the indicators reflect decisions that consumers and business executives have made since the war with Iraq ended, and they may now offer more insight into the economy's direction, economists say. 
Appearing before Congress last week, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that a series of disappointing reports over the previous month did not send a clear message about the economy because they still reflected concerns about the war. "Many more weeks of data will be needed to confidently discern the underlying trends," Mr. Greenspan said.
Stocks rose again today, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 953.22, its highest level since Aug. 22. 
Investors have also become more skeptical that the Fed will cut its benchmark short-term interest rate when it meets on June 24 and 25, judging from the price of a futures contract based on the rate.
The contract's price suggests that investors think a quarter-point reduction in the rate remains likely. Most forecasters, however, have said that the Fed officials will probably cut the rate either by a half-point, in a sign of their resolve to get the economy moving, or not at all, in a show of confidence. The odds of a half-point reduction are roughly one in three, based on the contract's closing price today, down from about one in two early last week.
The Fed's benchmark rate, which sets the interest rate on many credit-card, automobile and business loans and indirectly affects mortgage rates, is 1.25 percent, its lowest level since 1961. The Fed has cut the rate 12 times since the start of 2001 in an effort to encourage spending and end the lingering economic slowdown.
Over the next week, a series of other reports covering recent activity are likely to help economists determine whether the jump in retail sales is real and economic growth is indeed on the verge of accelerating, as most forecasters predict.
On Thursday, the Labor Department will announce the number of people who filed for unemployment insurance last week. On Friday, the Fed will release its weekly data on the amount of money businesses are borrowing. Next week, car manufacturers will announce their May sales, and an organization of corporate purchasing managers will release surveys about business activity during May.
The retail numbers released today offered tentative evidence that consumers have become more willing to spend money than they were during the first few months of this year, when sales were lower in some weeks than they were in 2002.
The Bank of Tokyo's index of chain-store sales remained flat during February and March before rising slowly in early April, compared to a year earlier, and last week's increase was only the second one above 3 percent this year. The other survey, the Instinet Research Redbook Average, provided a somewhat less optimistic picture, showing a 1.5 percent increase in sales. Still, that was the biggest increase in three weeks.
"Slowly, in a ragged fashion, the industry is showing better performance," said Michael P. Niemira, a senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo. But, he added, "it's not so powerful that everyone is happy."
At Target, the discount chain, sales rebounded last week after disappointing managers early this month, and May sales now appear likely to exceed the company's forecast, it said. Gains were biggest for pharmacy products, baby goods and children's apparel.
Wal-Mart Stores's sales projection has stayed roughly constant throughout the month, the company said.
Surveys of consumer confidence, another indicator offering nearly real-time glimpses of the economy, have also suggested reasons for some optimism. Although many analysts question whether the overall confidence numbers say much about the economy's direction, they say the individual questions within surveys often forecast changes in spending.
One closely followed measure -- consumers' near-term expectations for the economy -- rose this month, the University of Michigan reported on Tuesday. A second common harbinger of turning points is the percentage of Americans saying they expect the next five years to bring periods of widespread unemployment, and that declined to 36 percent in May, from 51 percent in March, the University of Michigan said.
"This is almost a repeat of what we saw at the end of the first gulf war," said Richard T. Curtin, director of surveys at the University of Michigan, who said he thought the economy was improving but still faced problems.
"What we have is the first surge in confidence," Mr. Curtin said. "I think we will see some slide. The question is how much."
Speaking today in Las Vegas, Robert T. Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, also cautioned against economic exuberance, according to a transcript of his remarks. "At this point, it appears that the economy is still mired in the soft patch we hit last fall," he said.
A "modest pickup" in the second half of the year was the most likely outcome, he added.
In a sign that business investment remained weak, the Commerce Department reported today that orders for durable goods -- expensive items like machinery and vehicles -- fell 2.4 percent in April, a larger decline than economists had expected.

Who Knew? A Shangri-La Within Driving Distance

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
Shorter vacations are again in vogue as a weak-kneed economy persuades more Americans to stick close to home. But coming up with a destination that is both nearby and unexplored can be tricky. 
 Enter TripAdvisor and its new Weekend Getaway Guide, which offers suggestions for trips to places that are 25to 300 miles away from a given ZIP code. The guide, which made its debut in late April, is a weekly e-mail newsletter that users sign up for at tripadvisor.com; in addition to suggested weekend trips, it contains links to published information and user reviews on thousands of tourist destinations in the United States and abroad. 
 For a southern Connecticut resident, TripAdvisor recently e-mailed weekend road trip suggestions for Atlantic City, supplying directions, the driving distance, a five-day weather forecast and recommended attractions and hotels, among other things. In case Atlantic City wasn't a good fit, TripAdvisor included links to eight other archived suggestions, among them Newport, R.I., bucolic Lenox, Mass., and, of course, New York.
Given Atlantic City's raison d'etre, some travelers with young children might quickly dismiss the notion of such a trip. But Trip Advisor's recommended reading detailed several interesting attractions for children, along with beach suggestions. Armed with such information, users might consider a spur-of-the-moment trip to be less of a gamble. Bob Tedeschi

Cash rewards and poverty alone do not explain terrorism.

"THE passing of Saddam Hussein's regime will deprive terrorist networks of a wealthy patron that pays for terrorist training, and offers rewards to families of suicide bombers," President Bush predicted in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute in February.
 Others in the administration, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, highlighted that Iraq's widely reported increase in payments to families of Palestinian suicide bombers, to $25,000 from $10,000, in the spring of 2002, encouraged suicide bomb attacks. Regime change, it was argued, would eliminate the incentive for suicide bombings. 
 This month's spate of suicide bombing attacks in the Middle East -- five in Israel, three in Saudi Arabia and five in Morocco -- should put this argument to rest. The number of suicide attacks per week in Israel was higher in the month after the fall of Baghdad than it was, on average, in the 14 months before the invasion. Of course, this is not a controlled experiment; other contributing factors have changed. But it would seem that the financial incentive provided by Iraq's payments has had little impact on the supply of suicide bombers so far. 
Why were the policy makers wrong? 
One possibility is that there are other wealthy patrons and Islamic charities, whose cash substituted for Saddam Hussein's. 
But I suspect the main reason is that most terrorists are not motivated by the prospect of financial gain or the hopelessness of poverty. 
The stereotype that terrorists are driven to extremes by economic deprivation may never have held anywhere, least of all in the Middle East. New research by Claude Berrebi, a graduate student at Princeton, has found that 13 percent of Palestinian suicide bombers are from impoverished families, while about a third of the Palestinian population is in poverty. A remarkable 57 percent of suicide bombers have some education beyond high school, compared with just 15 percent of the population of comparable age.
This evidence corroborates findings for other Middle Eastern and Latin American terrorist groups. There should be little doubt that terrorists are drawn from society's elites, not the dispossessed. 
Yet some stereotypes die hard. In 1958 the political scientist Daniel Lerner argued, "The data obviate the conventional assumption that the extremists are simply the 'have-nots.' "
It is still possible that well-off people in poor countries with oppressive governments are drawn to terrorism. President Bush argued something along these lines in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times on the anniversary of Sept. 11. "Poverty does not transform poor people into terrorists and murderers," he acknowledged. "Yet poverty, corruption and repression are a toxic combination in many societies, leading to weak governments that are unable to enforce order or patrol their borders and are vulnerable to terrorist networks." 
To investigate this possibility, I have analyzed data the State Department collects on significant international terrorist incidents. The home countries of the perpetrators of each event were identified. More terrorists do come from poor countries than rich ones, but this is because poor countries tend to lack civil liberties. 
Once a country's degree of civil liberties is taken into account -- measured by Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that promotes democracy, as the extent to which citizens are free to develop views, institutions and personal autonomy without interference from the state -- income per capita bears no relation to involvement in terrorism. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, which have spawned relatively many terrorists, are economically well off yet lacking in civil liberties. Poor countries with a tradition of protecting civil liberties are unlikely to spawn terrorists.
Evidently, the freedom to assemble and protest peacefully without interference from the government goes a long way to providing an alternative to terrorism. 
Apart from the size of a country and the extent of its civil liberties, no factor that I could find -- including the literacy rate, infant mortality rate, terrain, ethnic divisions and religious fractionalization -- could predict whether people from that country were more or less likely to take part in international terrorism.
After observing that "Saddam Hussein has raised the amount going to suicide bombers from $10,000 to $25,000," the comedian Jay Leno joked, "What's next, a health care plan?" 
Mr. Leno may be on to something. Financial incentives usually influence people's actions, but in this case they have a minor effect. The main motivation is deep devotion to a political, social or religious cause. When freedom of expression and other civil liberties are protected, there are nonviolent ways to express this devotion. 
If this is right, then terrorist attacks should increase in a repressive regime whenever the political situation is not heading in a direction the extremists prefer, irrespective of economic incentives. And terrorism and hate crimes seem to be particularly prevalent when countries go through an evolution in which normal law enforcement is disrupted, as in East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
The ultimate joke would be if civil liberties are sacrificed in the fight against terrorism, as a lack of civil liberties seems to be a main cause of terrorism around the world. Support for civil liberties should be part of the arsenal in the war against terrorism, both at home and abroad.

HEADLINE: Justices Urge Raises for Federal Colleagues 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
Armed with a report that shows judges leaving for more lucrative jobs, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made a rare public plea with three of his Supreme Court colleagues today to urge better pay for federal judges.
 For years Chief Justice Rehnquist has tried to draw attention to the salary issue in reports to Congress. 
 He stepped up the pressure late last year with a visit to the White House to lobby President Bush. Congress is considering a plan to give judges about $25,000 more a year, which would make up for years without any pay increases. 
"We must provide these judges, whom we ask and expect to remain for life, adequate compensation," Chief Justice Rehnquist told reporters at the court in a news conference with Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer.
The report, by the American Bar Association and the Federal Bar Association, shows that more judges have left the bench since 1990 than in the previous three decades. Many took private jobs.
The report also found that circuit and district judges' salaries, compared with inflation, had declined more than 23 percent since 1969. 
The buying power of Supreme Court salaries fell 37 percent.
The justices shrugged off a question about their personal financial sacrifices.
"I'm not taking three-month vacations in Europe, and I have not spent thousands and thousands of dollars educating my children," Chief Justice Rehnquist said.
He said that district judges, who earn about $155,000, can struggle to pay bills.
Justice Souter said that in the course of advising a friend who was being considered for a judgeship: "I said, 'Tell me how you are going to educate your kids.' That was the end of the conversation."
Justice Breyer, one of the wealthier members of the court, said that the pay scale should ensure that people of all backgrounds, not just the rich, would agree to become judges.
Justice Kennedy said there were problems in recruiting judges and keeping them from leaving for higher paying private jobs.
News conferences at the Supreme Court are extremely rare, usually reserved for the announcement of a retirement.
The subject of a possible retirement this year did not come up. Chief Justice Rehnquist, who has been on the bench 31 years, is considered the most likely prospect.
Although Supreme Court justices are federal judges, the four were making their plea on behalf of lower court judges.
The president of the American Bar Association, Alfred P. Carlton Jr., thanked the justices for having "a great deal of personal courage to stand up and talk about how much you make."
The report praises the pay raise plan that has passed a Senate committee, although Mr. Carlton said that it would be better if the raises were not linked to a proposal that gives judges the discretion to allow television cameras in their courtrooms.
After a recent cost-of-living increase, appeals court judges earn $164,000 and Supreme Court justices receive about $190,000. The chief justice is paid more than $198,000.

HEADLINE: Good News From Brazil 

 BODY:
The global economy may not be the happiest of stories these days, but it would be a far more tragic one had Brazil suffered a financial implosion in the past year, as many had feared. If Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, had defaulted on its $250 billion public debt, as neighboring Argentina had done, the consequences would have been catastrophic. The resulting panic would have affected not only Latin America, but all emerging markets. 
 The fact that this nation of 175 million is no longer on the brink of unleashing a global financial crisis -- and is instead helping to lead an emerging-market recovery -- is a tribute to the sound policies pursued by the five-month-old government of its leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and to a $30 billion rescue package the International Monetary Fund made available to Brazil last September. It is that rare success story in which the I.M.F. averts a disaster, as it was meant to do. In this case, the I.M.F. simply issued a vote of confidence in a country whose economic fundamentals were sound. That helped assuage investors' worries about the prospects of a da Silva presidency. 
 Since taking office in January, President da Silva has pursued policies that have strengthened the nation's financial standing. Brazil's currency and bonds have rallied strongly, easing its debt burden, and rampant inflation is beginning to taper off. The government is also maintaining a budget surplus.
Some of the president's most ardent supporters within his Workers' Party are not thrilled by all this economic orthodoxy, or by what Mr. da Silva himself calls "bitter medicine." The government's tough reform proposals for civil service pensions may cause further friction between the administration and party militants. But the president, a former labor leader, is right in saying he cannot succeed on his ambitious long-term social welfare agenda unless Brazil first gets its economic house in order.
A lot is riding on the outcome of Mr. da Silva's struggle to navigate between short-term reality and his grander aspirations -- not only for Brazil, but also for a growing number of left-of-center Latin leaders who look to him as a role model. Washington also seems to be warming to him. Treasury Secretary John Snow's first foreign trip was to Brazil last month, and it was announced last Thursday that Mr. da Silva would visit the White House next month.
Brazil and the United States, the two most populous nations in the Americas, are negotiating to forge a free trade area in the region by 2005. Success is far from certain. Brazil is a leading critic of indefensible farm subsidies in the United States and in Europe, yet is not keen on fully opening some of its own markets to foreign competition. Both sides need to offer concessions. It will be in Latin America's overall interest for the Bush and da Silva administrations to create a good working relationship as they tackle these difficult issues.

HEADLINE: Caught in the Squeeze 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
One of the things President Bush knows best is when to turn on the klieg lights, and when to keep them off.
 On Tuesday, with no fanfare, he signed a bill increasing the federal debt limit by nearly a trillion dollars. You don't want a lot of coverage when you're mortgaging the future. 
 But yesterday it was high-fives all around as Mr. Bush signed the third-largest tax cut in history at a grand ceremony in the East Room of the White House. 
I suppose if your income is large enough, there is every reason to celebrate. After all, the tax cut could save Dick Cheney $100,000 a year, or more.
But given the economic realities in the U.S. right now, I thought the East Room celebration was in poor taste. The enormous tax-cut package (which is coupled with budget deficits that are lunging toward infinity) is a stunning example of Mr. Bush's indifference to the deepening plight of working people.
The economy has lost more than a half-million jobs already this year, and well over 2 million since payrolls peaked two years ago. More than 8.7 million American men and women are officially counted as unemployed. And that figure is artificially low because it does not count those who have become discouraged and stopped looking for work.
The fallout from the continued hemorrhaging of jobs and the swollen ranks of the unemployed is spreading. The Times had an article two weeks ago about college seniors' putting their dreams on hold because they're graduating into the worst hiring slump in 20 years.
"We definitely picked the wrong time to be graduating from college," said Morgan Bushey, a 21-year-old student at the University of North Carolina. She said she planned to go to France, where she would make about $200 a week teaching English.
The jobs squeeze has other effects. "There's been this notion along the way that if you at least kept your job, you'd be O.K.," said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "But now this persistent unemployment is taking a toll on the wages of those who are still working."
Wages, when adjusted for inflation, are falling for workers across the board. An analysis of government data by Mr. Bernstein and Lawrence Mishel, the institute's president, found that the median weekly paycheck fell 1.4 percent over the past year. All the pay grades above and below the median are also sliding backward. White-collar, blue-collar -- workers in all pay grades are taking a hit. Even wage earners in the highest category have seen their pay slip by 1.4 percent.
"When unemployment got down to 4 percent in the late-1990's, you had broad-based wage growth -- and it was the first time we'd seen that in decades," said Mr. Bernstein. "That's gone."
The president is not calling his tax package the "Windfall for the Wealthy" act, which is what it is. He calls it the "Jobs and Growth" act, which is what it's not.
He would like us to believe that "with tax relief will come more jobs for the American people." But that's what he said in the last round of tax cuts, and the American people are still waiting.
In fact, the wait is becoming interminable for some. More and more Americans are joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed, those who are out of work for six months or more. A joint study by the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute called long-term unemployment "the scourge of a declining economy," and noted that it is taking its greatest toll among those who have traditionally felt economically secure.
"The reality," said the study, "is that the long-term unemployed are better educated, older and more likely to be professional workers."
What the economy needs is a real stimulus that will create real jobs, not an irresponsible package of tax cuts that will inflate the portfolios of the very wealthy while starving the government of the money needed to pay for essential services and to maintain a safety net for the nation's most vulnerable citizens.
We are closing schools and libraries in America, and withholding lifesaving drugs and medical treatment from the poor. The middle class is struggling ever harder to make ends meet, and reshaping its dreams of the future.
In Washington, they're celebrating.

HEADLINE: Battle Over Biotechnology Intensifies Trade War 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER with DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
President Bush said last week that Europe's opposition to genetically altered crops was a threat to efforts to end world hunger.
 But even many critics of Europe's stance say that the president's argument does not stand up and that the dispute needs to be understood for what it is: a multibillion-dollar cross-Atlantic battle over agricultural trade. 
 The disagreement will be played out this week at the meeting in France of the leading industrial countries. It pits European leaders, who say they are worried about the safety of importing genetically altered crops from the United States, against the Bush administration, which insists that Europe's attempts to block the crops are an illegal trade tactic.
The trade dispute heated up after an intense lobbying effort here in Washington, where some of the nation's most powerful interest groups -- farmers, the food industry and giant biotechnology companies -- have been pressing the administration to take on their case at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Europe. 
Lawyers and lobbyists for some interest groups have descended on the White House and Capitol Hill over the last few weeks to influence policy makers and lawmakers, and in some cases, to simply remind them of the importance of the Farm Belt in the next election.
Some of the biggest agriculture and biotechnology companies have invested billions of dollars over the last decade to develop genetically altered crops. Nearly 100 million acres of farmland in the United States are now planted with genetically altered crops, and agriculture officials say farmers have lost at least $1 billion over the last five years because they have been unable to export some biotechnology crops to Europe.
"We've been very patient with the Europeans, but their use of this ban as a trade barrier sets a precedent for countries around the world," said Mary Kay Thatcher, director of public policy at the American Farm Bureau Federation.
"We rely on export markets for one-third of our crops; this is a nightmare," she added.
Last week, the United States filed the equivalent of a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization, arguing that Europe's effort to block some genetically altered crops violated international trade rules.
At the Group of 8 summit in France this week, the Bush administration is expected to press its case that Europe accept genetically altered crops. But instead of arguing in the name of Monsanto -- the giant of agricultural biotechnology companies -- or American farmers, Mr. Bush and his aides will raise the issue of fighting world hunger.
In a speech last week he accused Europe of hindering the "great cause of ending hunger in Africa" by banning genetically modified crops. Administration officials say that such moves by Europe encourage African nations to reject technology that could save millions of lives.
That has upset European diplomats who are negotiating a compromise on biotechnology.
"It is quite shocking of Mr. Bush to tell us to follow his lead on African aid when the United States gives one of the smallest proportion of its gross domestic product for global development than any other wealthy nation," said a senior diplomat here. "This has not helped us."
Pascal Lamy, the top European trade official, even challenged the notion that Europe has a moratorium, saying that Europe is on the verge of completing new regulations that could open up the Continent to more genetically modified crops. Europe approved the sale of genetically altered soybeans in the 1990's, but then in 1998 Europe instituted a moratorium on approving new biotechnology crops like certain varieties of genetically altered corn. So while soybeans have been largely unaffected by the moratorium, corn exports have been harmed.
Several agriculture experts who want to lift European restrictions said that the problem would not be solved by opening up Europe's market.
"It's quite a stretch to tie the problem of the ban against genetically modified food in Europe to starving children in Africa," said Dan Glickman, who served as secretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration. "It is also a bit provocative to say the Europeans don't care about world hunger."
Scientists also agree.
"In general, that is not the case at all," said Pedro Sanchez, director of tropical agriculture at the Earth Institute at Columbia University.
"The main problems in Africa have to do with soil fertility," he said. "Until you solve the soil problems, it doesn't matter whether you use conventional or genetically modified seeds."
Backers of genetically altered crops say that they have been properly tested and that there is no scientific evidence that they pose a risk to humans or the environment.
Mickey Kantor, the first trade representative for President Clinton and a lawyer whose firm represents Monsanto, says the trade dispute has grown beyond complaints from biotechnology companies.
"It's not just about the industry anymore," he said. "It is a technology that can have a positive effect on world hunger."
If the biotechnology companies had done more for poor countries, that argument might hold, said Peter Pringle, author of the coming book, "Food, Inc.," (Simon & Schuster 2003).
Instead, he writes in his study of biotechnology, "while the industry claimed that their products would save the world from malnutrition, seed companies created only crops that made money for themselves and the wealthier farmers who could afford the premiums."
The current trade debate centers on opposing views about food safety and the need to test a product before it is put on the grocery shelf. How this dispute is resolved could determine the future course of agriculture, according to many agriculture economists.
Genetically altered crops, which have been biologically altered to do things like release their own insecticide, are already planted on more than 140 million acres worldwide, mostly in North and South America.
But consumers and regulators in Europe worry that the crops could pose a threat to humans or the environment.
Five years ago, Europe placed a moratorium on approving biotechnology crops. In preparing to end the moratorium, Europe is planning to impose new rules and regulations to trace crops back to their origin and label all genetically modified products, a move that could make it more difficult for Americans to export their biotechnology crops to Europe.
America's two biggest agricultural exports -- corn and soybeans -- could be greatly threatened by the new regulations to label the product, industry officials say. 
"We think that's the equivalent of putting a skull and crossbones on the packages, saying these things are bad," said Bob Callanan, a spokesman for the American Soybean Association in St. Louis.
American exports of corn to Europe have virtually dried up because corn farmers have widely adopted a form of biotech corn that kills pests.
"We went from about a 1.5 million metric ton market in 1998 to 23,000 metric tons, so it's pretty much been obliterated," said Hayden Milberg, director of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association, which is based in St. Louis.
The corn industry estimates that it has lost more than $1 billion since the moratorium. 
Some farmers are questioning the administration's strategy for opening the European market.
Harvey Joe Sanner, the director of the Soybean Producers of America, said Europe was the largest export customer for soybeans last year and he criticized some of the stronger remarks made by Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, in the current dispute.
"We are very concerned with the harsh rhetoric of late by Mr. Zoellick," he said in a statement today. "I am wondering how brilliant it is for a key government official, who should be promoting sales of U.S. soybeans, to use such derogatory terms in describing our largest single buyer."

HEADLINE: Bush Visit Will Lift Poland to Status of Special Friend 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: WARSAW, May 28 

 BODY:
President Bush is scheduled to stop in Poland later this week to spend a few hours on Friday and Saturday in the southern city of Krakow, and the point of his visit is obvious: to thank this country for supporting American policy in Iraq when other, bigger members of the Atlantic alliance campaigned vociferously against it.
 Mr. Bush's short stopover, during which he will visit the Auschwitz Concentration Camp Museum near Krakow, signals that Poland, in the enthusiastic eyes of Washington, has become an important ally, even a special friend -- to be distinguished from obstructionist allies in "old Europe," notably France and Germany. 
It is a strange and even improbable role for a country like Poland, whose tragic and tormented history kept it in the shadows for centuries. 
In Poland itself, the American wish for the European center of gravity to shift eastward and for Poland to play a large role is both gratifying and a bit awkward. Years ago, Poland's post-Communist leadership decided to find ways of enhancing its security by allying itself as closely as possible with the United States, but the potential costs to ties with closer nations in Europe were little weighed.
"Not all the consequences are positive, because of the fact that some European countries, especially France and Germany, adopted different policies on Iraq," Poland's foreign minister, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, said in an interview. "There were controversies, and, unfortunately, there is still something in the air, especially with France."
But, Mr. Cimoszewicz continued, "It's also an echo of the fact that our Western European partners and friends have to realize and accept that Poland is a serious partner, and should be respected. Its arguments should be listened to."
"We have 40 million people with good prospects," Mr. Cimoszewicz said. "We are the biggest state among those joining the E.U., and we have to play an important role."
What role exactly that will be -- assuming enough Poles vote to join the European Union in a June 8 referendum -- is the question being asked these days.
There are people here and elsewhere in Europe who believe that Poland will be swallowed whole by its more influential European partners.
Elsewhere in Europe, there have been undisguised expressions of astonishment and even contempt at Poland's newfound muscularity, a sense that the country is getting too big for its breeches. In remarks much noted here, the phrase "Trojan donkey" appeared in the German press to describe a Poland that was doing America's bidding in Europe, rather than working to create a counterbalance to American power.
And yet alongside any awkwardness Poland may feel at being caught between Europe and the United States goes unaccustomed security, and pride at standing on the same battlefields as the Americans, particularly in Iraq, where Poland is to send 1,500 soldiers to keep peace and will command one of four occupation zones.
Poland might not be able to pull Europe into strategic alignment with the United States, but influential Poles feel that it is nonetheless capable of exerting more influence than other European countries, accustomed to a weak and poor Poland, expect.
"Do we think we're a great world power? No," said Wanda Rapaczynski, the chief executive officer of Agora, a large publisher of newspapers and magazines. "Is this an unexpected element that tickles our fantasy? Yes."
"Of course, we have to limit our ambitions and make them proportionate to our actual potential," Mr. Cimoszewicz said. "But on the other hand, we should not underestimate our ability and potential. We have to find a real place for our country."
Krzysztof Bobinski , an editor and commentator, put it this way: "The majority view is that America will be the ultimate guarantor of Poland's security, and that the way to assure that is for Poland to go to Iraq and, perhaps, other places even farther afield. The alternative view would be that we have a long road ahead of us, and that the E.U. gives us a better chance in the long run."
By most comparisons, Poland does seem very small and backward compared to the bigger members of the European Union. Germany's annual trade with the United States, roughly $50 billion a year, is 50 times that of Poland. Germany's per capita income is five times that of Poland. France is Poland's largest source of foreign investment, and Germany is its largest market.
Poland's Solidarity workers' movement was a great factor in precipitating the end of the cold war, and the country has transformed both its economy and political institutions -- a strategic turn toward democracy and the American model developed in part to counter the weight of historic rival Russia looming to the east. But Poland has now had three bad economic years in a row, unemployment is running at close to 20 percent, and its government has been badly tainted by recent corruption scandals, giving rise to a palpable public cynicism.
Warsaw, the capital, is the kind of place where there are impressive goods to buy in the shops and crowds of people moving briskly, clearly with things to do. New international-class hotels have sprouted, and yet the dominant feature on the skyline remains the old Stalinist Palace of Culture built during the Communist period.
"Poland is not a dynamic economy," Mr. Bobinski said.
Two-thirds of Polish farmers produce only what they consume themselves, and nothing for the market, according to Piotr Stasinski, deputy editor in chief of the daily Gazeta Wyborcza. There are five times as many people, proportionately speaking, in agriculture in Poland than in Western Europe. The news magazine Poland Monthly now has a cover story called "The Other Poland," which reports on widespread hunger in rural areas.
But if a certain backwardness persists, Poland still represents half of the total population and half the gross domestic product of the 10 former Communist countries due tojoin the European Union next year.
Since joining NATO, it has also moved to enhance its air power and in so doing accentuate ties with the United States -- in three years, it will take delivery of 48 F-16 planes that it has bought from the United States, defying European pressure to buy Mirage 2000 fighters.
"This is a big country with a sense of history," Christopher Hill, the American ambassador, said in an interview. "It's not just a former grimy Communist country trying to privatize its textile mills. They're not going to be agenda takers; they're going to be agenda setters."

HEADLINE: Bush Signs Tax Cut Bill, Dismissing All Criticism 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
President Bush signed into law today the third tax cut in three years, dismissing criticism of the legislation's cost, fairness and effectiveness, while casting the measure as "essential action to strengthen the American economy." 
 Despite widespread disagreement among economists about the bill's potency as economic medicine in the short run and its implications for the national debt in the long run, Mr. Bush hailed the legislation as a job-creating measure that would also put much-needed cash in the hands of working people. 
 "By ensuring that Americans have more to spend, to save and to invest, this legislation is adding fuel to an economic recovery," Mr. Bush said in a signing ceremony in the East Room of the White House. 
Having aggressively sold the tax cut as a cure-all for an economy that has not been growing fast enough to prevent a steady loss of jobs or encourage a recovery in the stock market, Mr. Bush has much riding politically on whether it delivers on its promise -- or is perceived to do so, given forecasts that the economy is recovering gradually anyway.
After studying the final version of the legislation for several days, economists rendered judgments that reflected both analytical divisions over the ways in which tax cuts affect the behaviors of consumers, investors and businesses, and ideological rifts over the use of tax policy to shape the size and role of government.
"This is the most pro-growth tax cut we've seen since 1981, going back to the first Reagan tax cut," said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, an investment firm in Chicago. Mr. Wesbury, a proponent of tax-cutting "supply side" economics, said the package would easily provide enough punch to meet the White House's promise of creating a million jobs by the end of next year.
But Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning research organization in Washington, said the administration's own economic forecast, published in the "Economic Report of the President" in February, projected that the economy would create 4.4 million jobs in the next two years even without the stimulus of a new tax cut. If the tax cut is to be judged by its success in creating jobs, Mr. Mishel said, the standard should be whether it produces a million or more new jobs above the 4.4 million already forecast. The economy has lost more than two million jobs since Mr. Bush became president, measured by the number of non-farm employees, including a loss of several hundred thousand jobs this year alone. Few economists foresee the economy generating more than five million new jobs in the next 18 months, before Election Day 2004.
"The administration's policy was never really about job creation," Mr. Mishel said. "It was about shifting the burden of taxation onto wage earners and off people who have capital income, and about shrinking the government."
A study by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, projected that the number of jobs will increase by 3.2 million by the end of next year, with 500,000 of those a result of the tax cut.
Mark M. Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, a forecasting and consulting firm, projected that the tax cut would generate about 130,000 jobs this year and an additional 350,000 next year. But over the next decade, he said, the tax cut would actually cost jobs, in part because the resulting rise in budget deficits would push interest rates higher.
Many private economists are projecting that the deficit will reach at least $400 billion this year and next year, up from $158 billion last year, and that deficits are likely to persist for the foreseeable future. Although Mr. Bush quietly signed a $984 billion increase in the national debt limit on Tuesday, raising the limit to $7.4 trillion, Treasury department officials said the limit wouldmost likely have to be raised again between next April and October, in the heat of the presidential campaign.
"The tax cut will provide a small but much-needed near-term boost to the struggling economy," Mr. Zandi said. In the long run, he said, "Given the tax cutting we've done to date and the obvious spending requirements we have with defense and homeland security, we're going to have a very serious fiscal problem."
Economists also raised questions about whether the bill would do much to help stock prices. Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said the White House continued to believe that the reductions in taxes on capital gains and dividend income would "restore more confidence in markets." But Mr. Zandi concluded that the provisions would lift stock prices by no more than 2.5 percent if they are allowed to expire, as they would in 2008 under the law signed by Mr. Bush, and by no more than 5 percent if the provisions are made permanent, as Republicans hope to do.
Mr. Bush dismissed the criticism in general terms. With this "bold legislation, we're sending a clear message to the doubters that Washington can respond," Mr. Bush said, likening the tax cut to the nation's response to terrorism, two wars and a corporate scandal.
The bill will reduce income tax rates, increase the child credit, cut the rates on capital gains and dividends, provide tax breaks for small businesses and send $20 billion to state governments facing budget crises. It is valued at $350 billion over 10 years, although if Republicans succeed in their efforts to make permanent provisions in the bill that would otherwise expire, the price tag would rise to more than $800 billion.
The White House said workers would begin to benefit from the cut as soon as next month, as employers reduce the amount of money they withhold from paychecks to adjust for the reduction in income tax rates. Mr. Bush said 25 million families will receive checks in July to reflect the increase in the child credit.
The measure, which won approval on Capitol Hill last week, was the latest manifestation of Mr. Bush's success in pushing his tax-cutting agenda through Congress. He did so this time despite tepid public support in polls for tax cuts as an economic remedy, a closely divided Senate and vociferous objections from most Democrats, who said it favored the wealthy over lower-income people and would leave the nation deeply in debt as it faced the costs of providing retirement and health benefits to an aging population.
With the presidential campaign already heating up, this latest tax cut is sure to be subject to especially intense political scrutiny. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, a presidential candidate who has urged the repeal of Mr. Bush's entire 2001 tax cut, called the legislation signed into law today "unfair, unaffordable and ineffective."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, another of the party's nine declared candidates for the White House, said Mr. Bush's policies were "giving the most to those who need it least, piling more debt on the backs of our children and robbing Social Security and Medicare to pay for it."
But the focus on tax cuts could further expose the fissures within the Democratic Party over economic policy, diluting, at least until the party has a presidential nominee to rally around, the power of the opposition argument against Mr. Bush. The Democratic presidential candidates are divided over whether all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts should be repealed or allowed to stand. 
Two Democrats in the Senate, Zell Miller of Georgia and Ben Nelson of Nebraska, gave Mr. Bush his winning margin on the tax cut he signed today, and 12 Democrats in the Senate voted for Mr. Bush's 2001 tax cut.

HEADLINE: Details Set for Meeting With Bush in Mideast 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
President Bush will hold a three-way meeting in Jordan next week with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas, the new Palestinian prime minister, White House officials said today.
 The announcement of the meeting in the Red Sea port city of Aqaba formalized Mr. Bush's deepening personal involvement in trying to resolve the Middle East conflict. It is part of an initiative that is full of potential chances for failure. But administration officials said they saw little choice but for Mr. Bush to lend his prestige and credibility to the effort after the Iraq war. 
 They also said they hoped that both the Israelis and Palestinians would take some concrete steps toward peace before the three leaders meet on Wednesday.
Mr. Bush is to go on Tuesday to the resort town of Sharm el Sheik in Egypt, where he will meet with a number of Arab leaders, including Mr. Abbas. Mr. Sharon will not be included in that meeting, an administration official said, because Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia objected. 
Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said in a briefing to reporters today that Mr. Sharon would not be at the meeting of Arab leaders because "the format that we decided on was one that we thought worked best, and this format will work best."
Yasir Arafat, the longtime Palestinian leader, is to be excluded from the Sharm el Sheik gathering at the insistence of White House officials, who have been trying for months to marginalize him. Nonetheless, Arab diplomats said today that they believed that no agreement on the Middle East's future could be reached without the approval of Mr. Arafat.
White House officials said the meeting in Aqaba would take place with the caveat of "conditions permitting," apparently meaning that it could be called off if there was another round of violence or suicide bombings. But they also said that conditions now were better than they had been in many months for pushing both parties toward the idea of two nations, Israel and Palestine, existing side by side in the Middle East.
"The president just believes that this is a good time to sit down, face to face, eye to eye, with the leaders who have responsibility for trying to bring about that peace," Ms. Rice said.
The meeting in Aqaba became possible last weekend, when Mr. Sharon persuaded the Israeli government to endorse the American-backed peace plan, known as the road map, and to officially accept a Palestinian claim to statehood. But many details remain to be worked out. White House officials made it clear that the meeting in Aqaba would be a very early first step.
"This is going to be a long process, and it is going to have ups and downs, as it has always had," Ms. Rice said.
White House officials have been working on a meeting of the three leaders since Mr. Sharon canceled a May 20 visit to Washington because of a suicide bombing. With the White House visit off, administration officials began exploring the idea of a meeting of Mr. Bush, Mr. Sharon and Mr. Abbas in the Middle East at the end of a trip by Mr. Bush to an economic summit meeting in Evian, France.
Administration officials said the original location for a three-way meeting was Sharm el Sheik, the same spot President Bill Clinton visited on several occasions to try to bring the Israelis and Palestinians together. In October 2000, Mr. Clinton brokered a truce between Mr. Arafat and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister at the time. But this time, administration officials said, Egypt was reluctant to be the host of a meeting that would include Mr. Sharon.
As a result, the administration officials came up with the solution of the two meetings, one with the Arab leaders in Sharm el Sheik -- which is also to include President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan -- and the other the three-way meeting in Aqaba.
The meetings in Jordan and Egypt will come at the end of a six-day trip by Mr. Bush to Europe and the Middle East. The president is to leave this Friday for Poland, where he will tour the sites of the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau and deliver a speech about Europe and the trans-Atlantic alliance in Krakow.
On Saturday, Mr. Bush will meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in St. Petersburg for the city's 300th-anniversary celebration. He will then travel to a meeting of the leading industrialized democracies, known as the Group of 8, in Evian, France. There Mr. Bush will have his first face-to-face meeting since the war in Iraq with President Jacques Chirac of France. Mr. Bush will also meet with Hu Jintao, the new president of China.
From Evian, Mr. Bush will travel to the Middle East. After his meetings in Egypt and Jordan, he will make a final stop to see American troops at the United States Central Command forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, where he will meet with the Bush administration's new civilian administrator for Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, and Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of allied forces in Iraq.
White House officials said there were no plans at this time for Mr. Bush to go to Iraq, where security and the delivery of basic services are unstable.

HEADLINE: Tax Law Omits $400 Child Credit for Millions 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
A last-minute revision by House and Senate leaders in the tax bill that President Bush signed today will prevent millions of minimum-wage families from receiving the increased child credit that is in the measure, say Congressional officials and outside groups.
 Most taxpayers will receive a $400-a-child check in the mail this summer as a result of the law, which raises the child tax credit, to $1,000 from $600. It had been clear from the beginning that the wealthiest families would not receive the credit, which is intended to phase out at high incomes. 
 But after studying the bill approved on Friday, liberal and child advocacy groups discovered that a different group of families would also not benefit from the $400 increase -- families who make just above the minimum wage. 
Because of the formula for calculating the credit, most families with incomes from $10,500 to $26,625 will not benefit. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group, says those families include 11.9 million children, or one of every sixchildren under 17.
"I don't know why they would cut that out of the bill," said Senator Blanche Lincoln, the Arkansas Democrat who persuaded the full Senate to send the credit to many more low income families before the provision was dropped in conference. "These are the people who need it the most and who will spend it the most. These are the people who buy the blue jeans and the detergent and who will stimulate the economy with their spending."
Ms. Lincoln noted that nearly half of all taxpayers in her state had adjusted gross incomes that were less than $20,000.
Families with incomes lower than $10,500 will also not receive the refund checks. But under the 2001 tax revision, they would not have been eligible for either the $600 or the $1,000 credits because they do not pay federal taxes. Proposals to give them the credits failed on the House and Senate floors on party-line votes.
The Senate provision that did pass was intended to help those families making $10,500 to $26,625 who do pay federal taxes and could have taken all or part of the $600 credit. The provision, which would have cost $3.5 billion, would have allowed those families to receive some or all of the extra $400 in the new law.
Most families with children who make about $30,000 or less are also eligible for the earned income credit, which the law does not not change. In addition, the law has a few other benefits for low income earners, like expanding the lowest tax bracket and a temporary reduction in the penalty on two-income couples.
Several centrist senators worked hard to make the child credit fully refundable for all low income families, and the full Senate voted this month to include a provision that would have included the minimum-wage families. But the provision was dropped in the House-Senate conference, where tax writers spent days trying to cram many tax cuts -- most prominently, cuts in the taxes on stock dividends and capital gains -- into a bill that the Senate said could not be larger than $350 billion.
House Republicans, who acknowledged the gap on the child credit, blamed the Senate for insisting on its $350 billion cap, saying the low-income families could have been covered had the Senate been more flexible. 
A spokeswoman for the Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, Christin Tinsworth, noted that the provision was included in an agreement reached last week by Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, the committee chairman, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
That agreement would have cost $380 billion, but it fell apart when an important swing senator, George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, said he could not approve any bill that exceeded $350 billion. To satisfy him and the Senate, Ms. Tinsworth said, the child credit provision was dropped, along with other costs.
"The Senate preferred to have $20 billion in state aid," she said. "But when we had to squeeze it all to $350 billion, they weren't talking about the child credits. This bill does a lot to help people who need help. But its primary purpose was to generate jobs. Apparently, whatever we do is not going to be enough for some segments of the population."
But Democrats and children's advocacy groups said the Republican demand for large cuts in the dividend tax, which they said benefits primarily wealthy taxpayers, pushed away the credit from low income families.
"If we were going to have a tax cut to give $1,000 to all these other kids, there's no reason not to include these kids, too," said David Harris, president of the Children's Research and Education Institute. "Their families are working and playing by the rules and are left out, though it would not have cost too much to include them."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Voinovich said the senator would have been happy to extend the child credits, but believed that the entire package should not pass $350 billion. The tax writers were free to reduce the dividend tax cut, noted the spokeswoman, Marcie Ridgway.
The gap in the number of families who receive the child credit occurs because of how the formula was arranged in 2001. Congress decided then to give refunds of the credit to low income families, but just to a maximum of 10 percent of the amount they made over $10,000, or a refund of $600, whichever was lower. The $10,000 amount was indexed to inflation and is now $10,500.
When the credit was raised to $1,000, many families could not qualify for the extra amount, because the 10 percent maximum still limited them. Ms. Lincoln proposed raising the formula to 15 percent, which would have covered the increase in the credit for most of those families. Her proposal made it through the Senate Finance Committee, but later she voted against the full cut. 
Because her vote and those of other supporters were not necessary for final passage, Republicans knew they could drop the provision without hurting the bill's chances in the Senate.
"I guess this shows us what our priorities are," Ms. Lincoln said. "I think this tax bill is very irresponsible in the way it treats families."

A front-page article last Thursday about a revision in the new tax law that will prevent millions of minimum-wage families from receiving a $400 child credit misstated the tax situation of families earning less then $10,500. While they are exempt from federal income tax, many do pay Social Security and Medicare taxes.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Weekender Millbrook, N.Y.

BYLINE:  By ELLEN MAGUIRE 

 BODY:
WHEN Harvard dismissed Timothy Leary, the psychology professor turned psychedelic drug guru, in 1963, he dropped out, at the invitation of a wealthy benefactor, to Millbrook. This polished enclave of vast estates and hundred-acre horse farms set in the lush hills of the eastern Hudson River Valley became the unlikely home of Leary's Castalia Institute, where he conducted controversial experiments with LSD. (It is also where he was arrested by G. Gordon Liddy, then with the Dutchess County Sheriff's Department, in one of several brushes with the law.)
 The Castalia Institute no longer exists and these days Millbrook has a different kind of research center, the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, with a director, Gene Liken, who studies a different kind of acid: acid rain. Many weekend residents are patrons. "It's an oasis," said Ronald S. Gross, a corporate lawyer with a Ph.D. in botany who has an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Millbrook. "We listen to top scientists lecture on significant issues like Lyme disease." 
 Otherwise, Millbrook hasn't changed much. Greek Revival homes sheltered by mature oaks and sugar maples, rare breeds of cattle grazing the open fields and a 130-acre vineyard heighten the sense of centuries-old gentility. Weekend residents shoot pheasant and quail, perfect their fly-fishing casts and visit antiques shops. 
Luxury cars jockey for position outside Mabbettsville Market, an upscale grocery. Inside, women in riding boots and men in spotless barn jackets queue up for espresso. Pockets remain deep, and at least five philanthropic foundations operate in Millbrook.
Some local residents, however, are struggling because of the weakened economy; the Northeast Dutchess Fund of the Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation was started in 2002 with $100,000 from a publicity-shy second-home owner to help residents who lack phones, plumbing, kitchens or health insurance. 
Residents of the village of Millbrook and the town of Washington, of which it is a part, have Millbrook mailing addresses, and most people refer to the entire area as Millbrook. "It's a desirable address," Mayor Don Briggs said with a laugh. "Sometimes we catch residents of other towns slipping over here to get a post office box."

The Scene
Ric Ocasek of the Cars, Mary Tyler Moore and Liam Neeson all have houses in Millbrook, but they are among the newcomers. Residents, full time or part time, whose families have been in Millbrook for generations keep alive events like the Millbrook Hunt and the hunt ball. The Sandanona Hare Hounds is a group that sponsors weekly beagling: hounds chase the scent of cottontail rabbits and participants follow on foot. Every summer the Millbrook Horse Trials attract Olympics-caliber riders.
Other residents socialize in less tradition-bound ways.
Tim Smalls, an equity trader from Brooklyn Heights who bought a 19th-century colonial on 50 acres three years ago as his weekend home, takes his family to the July fishing derby at the town park and to free concerts at the town band shell. "It's great," he said. "The local plumber sits on a blanket drinking wine next to the C.E.O. of a Fortune 500 company."
Night life is minimal. "There's no big scene," said Mish Tworkowski, a jewelry designer from Manhattan. "That forces us to spend time at home with friends, which is a beautiful thing." Four years ago, he and his partner, Joseph Singer, an architect, bought a crumbling creamery and an adjacent barn, once part of a 19th-century estate, and combined them to create a 2,500-square-foot second home. "There were trees growing in the foundation walls," Mr. Singer said. Now their great room has 14-foot ceilings and original tongue-and-groove panels. 
An informal soccer league draws many foreign nationals living in town. "When the Argentinians play the Italians, it's fierce," said Elizabeth Baravalle, a store owner who moved to Millbrook from Milan in 1999.
Residents are proud of the recently renovated Millbrook Free Library; the capital campaign raised $2.5 million in eight months. In June, the Merritt Bookstore, which supports more than 10 book clubs and writing groups, will hold an overnight student read-athon to raise money for American Indian children nationwide.

Pros
Urbanites yearning for touches of small-town life can find them in Millbrook.
"We know everyone in every store by name," said Adelaide Camillo, an arts consultant for nonprofit groups and the wife of Mr. Gross, the corporate lawyer. The couple also catch up on local news during trips to the dump. "England has its pubs; we have the transfer station," Ms. Camillo said.
The village clerk, Karen McLaughlin, can send her sons, who are 10 and 13, out alone for ice cream without much worry. "Once the local police officer called to report my boys had crossed the road from between parked cars instead of at the corner," she said.
Gardeners abound. "Knock over a geranium pot, and you're one of Millbrook's most wanted," said Ms. Baravalle.
Many weekenders grow their own flowers and vegetables, and the Millbrook Farmers Market operates in the summer months. "I hit the ground on Friday afternoon with flats in my hand and that's it for the weekend," said Edith Kean, a landscape designer from Manhattan who has owned a second home in Millbrook for 16 years.
Many credit the Dutchess Land Conservancy with preserving open lands by acquiring conservation easements from local owners; under the easements, owners retain the land but relinquish development rights. The group has protected 4,600 acres in Washington this way, according to its executive director, Rebecca Thornton.
Children like the Trevor Zoo, which has more than 120 animals, including week-old red wolf pups. It is part of the Millbrook School, a private preparatory school where William F. Buckley Jr. was once a student. Wing's Castle, a private home with seven towers, a moat and mountain views built by Peter and Toni Wing using salvaged materials, is the site of an annual Shakespearean day camp for children. 
There are several popular restaurants in the village. Slammin' Salmon offers lunch daily, along with prepared food; the Cloud 9 Cafe serves breakfast and lunch; Cafe les Baux, a new French bistro, is open for lunch and dinner.

Cons
Millbrook may attract captains of industry, but Mother Nature still runs the ship. Spring is mud season. "We have wellies in the car and wellies by the front door," said Mr. Tworkowski. "If you live in your Manolo Blahniks, this is not the place for you."
Fresh produce is hard to find during winter, and long driveways that provide privacy can be difficult to clear after a large snowfall. During storms, power failures are frequent; many residents have their own generators.
While Lyme disease is prevalent in many parts of the Northeast, Dutchess County has one of the highest per capita rates in the country, and residents take every precaution during outdoor activities.
An air of exclusivity extends to a number of private shooting and sports clubs that have complex membership requirements and waiting lists of up to five years.

Real Estate Market
Housing prices rose nearly 23 percent from the end of 2000 until June 2002, when they leveled off, according to Peter Devers of George T. Whalen Real Estate (845-677-5076; www.gtwhalen.com). "The inventory in every price range is the lowest I've seen in my 22 years of selling real estate," Mr. Devers said. On the market in Millbrook and Washington this week were 39 single-family houses, five condominiums and town houses and seven parcels of undeveloped land.
This week, Whalen Real Estate offered a 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom cottage on 1.76 acres with a pond for $595,000 and a new four-bedroom, 3,162-square-foot house on 22 acres for $1.14 million. Diane Toland of H. W. Guernsey Realtors (845-677-5311, www.hwguernsey.com) predicted that the market would heat up along with the weather. Listings at Guernsey this week included a 2,125-square-foot split-level house with four bedrooms and views of the Catskills for $299,500 and a former home of Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., a 6,571-square-foot shingled house with 10 bedrooms and a stable, pool and pond for $3.3 million.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Modern China's Clashing Values, Mirrored in a Prodigy's Career

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Music, mostly of the Western classical variety and much of it floridly romantic, pours through Chen Kaige's film "Together" and helps infuse its story of a teenage violin prodigy and his devoted father with a feverish emotionalism. The newest movie by the Chinese filmmaker best known for "Farewell My Concubine" is not afraid to push buttons with its heady potpourri of Bruch, Richard Strauss, Liszt and Massenet, all pointing toward a climactic performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in D.
 The grand musical swirl lends "Together" the feel of a historical epic, even though the movie is set almost entirely in contemporary Beijing and its screenplay barely alludes to the political and economic changes that have swept through China since the Cultural Revolution. The three major characters -- Xiaochun (Yun Tang); his father, Cheng Liu (Peiqi Liu ); and Lili (Hong Chen), a haughty, high-strung material girl who becomes both a fantasy figure and a surrogate mother to the boy -- are broadly drawn, almost symbolic figures in a movie that sheds more than one tear before it culminates in a weepy, inspirational cloudburst. 
 Characters who may at first seem selfish and hardhearted eventually reveal unexpected depths of generosity and nobility that, given what we know about them, requires some suspension of disbelief. This is a movie that insists people are good -- that when all is said and done they come through for one another when it really counts. The music insists upon it.
At the center of the story is Xiaochun, a shy 13-year-old violin prodigy who lives with his father in a provincial Chinese city. Hearing of a competition in Beijing that could be a stepping stone for his son, Liu, a short-order cook with few resources, takes the boy to the capital. The father worships his son's gift and eagerly abases himself in Xiaochun's behalf by badgering potential teachers to become his tutors.
But his persistence pays off. Xiaochun's first teacher, Professor Jiang (Zhiwen Wang), a grouchy eccentric who lives in squalor surrounded by his cats, treats his student as a housekeeper until the boy lashes back and expresses his disgust at Jiang's slovenly ways. Through his father's perseverance, Xiaochun eventually becomes one of two live-in students of Professor Yu (Chen Kaige), who is much more encouraging
The movie, which opens today in New York and Los Angeles, is nearly stolen by Hong Chen's hot-blooded portrait of Lili, an upstairs neighbor and would-be femme fatale who bewitches the adolescent musician. Beautiful, spirited and greedy, Lili is determined to marry money. But her potential husbands have other ideas, and her aggressive overtures are often cruelly rebuffed. Xiaochun earns tips from Lili by giving impromptu serenades as she prepares for her dates. In the story's turning point, he impulsively sells his violin to buy her a white fur-trimmed coat he observed her admiring in a dress shop.
Ms. Chen's Lili is a flaming creature who imperiously struts and sashays about and barks orders like a 1950's Hollywood floozy on the romantic warpath. The performance is so confident it almost reconciles the gaping contradictions of a character who seesaws between extremes of brassy self-promotion and tender solicitation.
Yun Tang's Xiaochun maintains an enigmatic reserve throughout the movie, which periodically drops clues as to what's seething under his placid, poker-faced facade. When Liu finds his son's violin case and sheet music plastered with pinups, it is suddenly clear that the boy's hormones are in full eruption. The selling of his violin is the culmination of Xiaochun's silent, deepening resentment toward a father whose obsequious groveling and devoted self-sacrifice have become a smothering embarrassment. But Xiaochun also has a solid gift and knows it, and as he moves through the film, Mr. Tang imbues him with an undercurrent of hauteur.
"Together" may not be overtly political, but its vision of contemporary Beijing, where brazen, fashion-crazed gold diggers like Lili bait their hooks to snare arrogant, slippery wheeler-dealers who end up playing her for a sucker, has bite. In the broad scheme of things, Liu represents the pure old ways, while Lili and her feckless boyfriends are the avid harbingers of a soulless but seductive consumer culture that is taking root. Xiaochun, torn between the two, is struggling like the rest of China to find a comfortable balance between aesthetic ideals and material temptations.
"Together" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language and adult themes.

 BODY:
Small Show, Big Reaction
 Just when it seemed the season was casually meandering toward its inevitable conclusion, a tiny one-person show is causing an outsize ruckus on West 42nd Street. 
 That's the home of Playwrights Horizons -- at 416 West 42nd, to be exact -- where on Tuesday night the company opened a modest production of a new play by Doug Wright, "I Am My Own Wife," for a brief run right in the middle of Tony season. The show is simple: one actor, one set, one story, that of a German transvestite, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, and life under the Nazi and East German regimes. 
The reaction to "Wife" has been anything but simple. Newspaper reviews on Wednesday ranged from good to excellent, with particular praise for the show's little-known star, Jefferson Mays, who plays dozens of characters in von Mahlsdorf's life. Writing in The New York Times, Bruce Weber said Mr. Mays delivered "an extraordinary performance," adding that audiences were "riveted by his commitment to the character's self-knowledge and proud eccentricity."
Those notices have attracted attention both inside Playwrights and beyond. The show, which was scheduled to run only two weeks, has been extended through July 20, and commercial producers are circling for the rights to take it elsewhere. The production is selling "the best of any show in years," said Tim Sanford, the company's artistic director.
Nothing is set, but Mr. Sanford seemed confident that "Wife" would have a life. "There were producers interested before it opened, and that interest is still there," Mr. Sanford said, adding that both Broadway and Off Broadway had been bandied about as possible future sites. The producers have also asked that Mr. Mays, who has worked extensively in regional theater and with downtown directors like Anne Bogart, keep his schedule open for a while. One of Mr. Mays's first big roles was in another Doug Wright play, "Quills," in 1995.
The show, directed by Moises Kaufman ("Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde"), seems particularly popular among theater professionals, and many were at the opening. One early fan was Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, who advised his troops last week to check out the production. Other producers said to be interested include the San Francisco-based heiress Carole Shorenstein Hays, ("Take Me Out") and Susan Gallin, now represented by "Man of La Mancha."
One obvious appeal for a commercial producer -- besides the art, it's always about the art -- is that it would be very affordable (no pyrotechnics, a really small cast).
The timing is also in the company's favor. The show is playing in a new 200-seat theater that has nothing else booked until fall, so Playwrights can take a nice long time to decide and maybe have another extension. "It's not a pressing urgency," Mr. Sanford said, "which is nice, because summer can be a very slow time in the theater."

A Record, and Not
A little bookkeeping and record-breaking: The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that it had tallied the year's sales and that it was estimating that the Broadway gross would be more than $720.9 million for the 2002-3 season, which ends Sunday. (The season runs for 52 weeks from the last Tony Awards; last year's awards were June 2.)
That's an all-time high, said the league's president, Jed Bernstein, and a 12 percent increase over last season, which was rough because of the slow economy and Sept. 11. But while the gross is a record, actual attendance was not, indicating that Broadway ticket prices continue to rise. Estimated attendance will be 11.4 million, just shy of the 11.9 million record in the 2000-1 season.

The Next Season
Broadway, land of the musical, confirmed another new straight play for the fall, joining the previously announced Richard Greenberg's "Violet Hour," expected at the Biltmore, and "Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks,"due at a theater to named.
It is "Retreat From Moscow," a family drama by William Nicholson that played at the Chichester Festival in England in 2000 and was briefly rumored in May 2001 to be moving to Broadway with Mike Nichols as its director and producer and a cast including Ralph Fiennes, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Sinead Cusack. Those plans never developed, however, and by the end of that year another producer, Susan Gallin, was in the mix.
Now, Ms. Gallin and Stuart Thompson plan to open the play at the Booth Theater on Oct. 23 under the direction of Daniel Sullivan, who has directed "Proof" and "A Moon for the Misbegotten" in recent years. He is close to announcing his cast, including John Lithgow (who won the Tony for best actor in a musical last year in "Sweet Smell of Success"), the fine Eileen Atkins and Ben Chaplin, the 32-year-old British actor.
Mr. Chaplin, who has performed on the West End and in film ("Murder by Numbers," "The Truth About Cats and Dogs"), will play the son of the Lithgow and Atkins characters, a couple whose 35-year marriage is deteriorating.

Along the Way
* Gale Gates et al., an always provocative, often oblique experimental company that was a trailblazer in Brooklyn, is calling it quits. The eight-year-old company produced and presented nearly 60 multimedia events (naked people, awesome lights, strange prose), many conceived by its artistic director, Michael Counts, and all staged in the company's 40,000-square-foot space. Michelle Stern, the company's producing director, said the troupe was folding after an extended search for an executive director proved fruitless. The company will celebrate its demise with a bash-performance event on July 12.
* The Aquila Theater Company, a classically trained, modernly hip troupe that did a well-received version of "Comedy of Errors" last summer, returns this year with a spiced up 1970's version of Oscar Wilde's "Importance of Being Earnest." Performances begin June 21 at the Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at East 25th Street, Manhattan.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
Where Adults Go to Play In the Mud

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: SOUTH BEND, Ind. 

 BODY:
LIKE most of the students at Hummer camp, Maria del Carmen Grimmelmann tends to gush. "It moves me," Mrs. Grimmelmann, 51, said of the supercharged Hummer H2 she and her husband, Frank, bought earlier this year.
 "You know when you go shopping and nothing moves you?" she asked. "Then there's the time you see something, and right away know it's perfect. It's like falling in love. When I'm driving it, I feel empowered. It's the car that opens the sea for me. Now I know how Moses felt." 
 Every few years a vehicle comes along that draws a crowd, but few have been loved or hated with such vigor as the Hummer. To environmentalists, it is a gas-gulping, globe-warming menace. To consumer safety advocates, a highway battering ram. But to many of its customers, the Hummer is the first American car to stir emotion in decades. 
And for the truly smitten, there is Hummer camp, a sort of 21st-century dude ranch of mud-besotted excess more formally known as the Hummer Driving Academy. For three nights and two days last week, half a dozen students convened for a camp session, rambling over obstacle courses and roaring through 300 acres of muddy terrain thickly wooded with beech, white oak, cherry and shag-bark hickory trees in South Bend. The fee for this privilege is $3,575, plus $875 to bring along a spouse. 
The campers were from far-flung locales and backgrounds. Among them, for example, were Red Barley, 64, a retired Defense Department engineer from Severna Park, Md.; Major Chance, 58, a San Diego entrepreneur in the retirement housing business; Gary Hobbs, a 55-year-old Ferrari dealer from Oakton, Va.; and Mark Mills, 52, an unemployed former Verizon worker from Ohio.
Wait. How can Mr. Mills afford a $48,000 Hummer H2?
He won an $11 million Ohio lottery jackpot in 2001. And as the basketball star Lebron James demonstrated, buying a Hummer is de rigueur for mega-nouveau riche Ohioans.
But for Hummer skeptics, two questions linger: Who buys this thing? And why?
We need answers. To Hummer camp!
Once a private hunting ground for South Bend's last auto dynasty, the Studebakers, the woodsy campgrounds are now run by AM General, which manufactures Hummers and the military transports they are patterned after, Humvees. (General Motors bought the rights to market Hummers in 1999 and designed the H2.) On the edge of the woods, a modest, warehouse-style classroom complex is surrounded by an obstacle course that contains pits filled with water, boulders or mud.
Hundreds of students pass through the camp each year. Some are members of the Army's Special Forces units, learning to drive Humvees. Others are Hummer owners; this year classes have been added for the new H2. 
Even the Hummer owners drive the camp's H2's rather than their own. That gives them license to run risks they might never take with their own trucks. (Hummer drivers don't typically drive off-road -- that's what Hummer camp is for.)
"This is too nice a truck to do this to," said Mr. Mills, the jowly, mustachioed lottery winner, appraising a camp loaner that was covered with dirt and scratches after becoming so bogged down in mud that it took a winch to pull it free. "They said they had their own trucks. I was like, 'I'll come.' "
What's the appeal of Hummer camp? Uncomplicated. Take the proverbial boy in the sandbox. Add a few decades, a few pounds, some gray hair, a global positioning device and plenty of disposable income. Throw in oil, water and 6,400 pounds of steel, rubber and leather. And time to bond with like-minded souls (some of whom may even turn out to be women).
Scenes from Hummer camp:

WEDNESDAY, AFTER LUNCH -- Mark Mills and David Paschen, a 50-year-old recreational vehicle dealer from Chesterton, Ind., acquaintances for all of one day, are barreling up and down mud hills following a caravan of Hummers. Mr. Paschen is playing befuddled straight man while Mr. Mills doles out zingers.
Why did you buy a Hummer, Dave?
"I turned 50, and I decided if I was ever going to do it, this was the time," Mr. Paschen replied.
Mr. Mills interjects, "His wife said he could."
Mark, why did you buy a Hummer?
Well, he had a BMW sports car and had considered an H1, but there were complications.
"I don't want to say I'm a fat guy," he explains. "But I'm a fat guy. The seats in that H1 aren't very big." Besides, the H1 was twice the H2's price.
"I only have so much money," Mr. Mills said. Kidding!

3:20 P.M. -- Their Hummer is inching along a narrow downhill trail strewn with what seem like ski-slope moguls.
Mr. Mills: "Dave likes the brake. Dave won't take a foot off the brake. Oh man, Dave, you're never going to make it through this."
Mr. Paschen: "We'll make it." He does not sound convinced, but they clear the hill after a jarring ride.

4:20 P.M. -- Classroom time. The Chances (Major and Judy) of San Diego are sitting in front of the Grimmelmanns (Frank and Maria) of Anthem, Ariz., and all are trying to find local landmarks on nifty global positioning devices that have been handed to them.
"No wonder this course costs so much," says Mr. Mills, from the back.
Mr. Paschen, next to him: "What's Cleveland doing here? I think we're in trouble." 
Mr. Chance notes that he has the coordinates of a bar.
"I already found it," Mr. Mills says.

5:12 P.M. -- Seven students are outside trying to acquire satellite signals with their G.P.S. units, then amble in zigzag patterns toward a Dumpster. It's a test. They'll need this skill later for the Hummer Olympics. (That's another story, but suffice it to say Mr. Paschen and Mr. Mills finished last and had particular trouble with the blind Hummer driving test and balancing their H2 on a giant seesaw.)

THE NEXT MORNING -- Judy Chance and Maria Grimmelmann are on the practice course. Before setting out, Mrs. Chance, the driver, momentarily rests her blond head on the steering wheel, sunglasses in place, as Mrs. Grimmelmann, in the back seat, makes the sign of the cross. Ahead, a concrete barrier looms, followed by a short hill sloped at a 31-degree angle, in the manner of the highway turnoffs sometimes cut into mountainsides to corral runaway trucks.
"Very gently, I'd like you to touch the wall," Timothy Bonadies, the 46-year-old course designer and manager of the camp, says from the front passenger seat. He has learned to coax leaps of faith gently from the gravity-bound.
Slowly, they nudge over the 16-inch concrete barrier, tire by tire, and approach the slope.
"Roll forward," says Mr. Bonadies, whoserves as a sort of Zen master. "Approach it like your driveway at home."
"Oh my God," says Mrs. Chance, as the behemoth eases up the slope and points toward the blue sky. "I can't see anything."
"Roll up and over," Mr. Bonadies says. "Straight ahead."
The truck clears the slope, only to find another, angled steeply sideways, which causes the right side to soar while the left dips to a mere arm's length from the ground. While Mrs. Chance leans over the gear shift to fight the sensation that she is about to tumble out her window, Mr. Bonadies is perched high above her.
His voice remains serene. 
It won't help you to lean this way," he says.
Later, Mrs. Grimmelmann observed: "You can't be afraid. If you let fear take over, that's where you fall into mishaps. This vehicle really brings out that inner strength you didn't know you had."
Truck drivers used to intimidate her to the point that she would pull off the road to let them pass.
"But when I'm in the Hummer, they leave me alone," she said. "They just go away. And I like that."
Mr. Chance, a man with the erect bearing and basso voice of a somewhat younger Charlton Heston, explained the Hummer appeal over dinner. 
"The last G.M. car I liked was a '57 Chevy," he said. "I think it's so important that car designers create passion. Europe does it -- BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari. They create passion and make you willing to write a check. There's no logic. If I had sat down and done a cost-benefit analysis, I would have been, 'No-o-o.' Of course, I took delivery in California, and gas went to $2.50. So that's a statement of passion or stupidity, I don't know which."
This is why G.M. executives, beleaguered by foreign competition, love the Hummer. To them, it is a premium-price miracle that sells without the huge incentives needed to move Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and even Cadillacs.
"Having grown up in G.M., it's kind of like getting a winning lottery ticket," Marc Hernandez, Hummer's marketing director, said of his current job. He can remember working at G.M. divisions that aroused anything but passion. 
"I know what it's like to hear the crickets," he said, "and watch the tumbleweed roll across my desk."

Standard & Poor's Index Falls, Ending a Five-Day Rally

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell for the first trading day in six yesterday as some investors said its rally to a nine-month high already reflected expected gains in earnings.
 "We've probably seen the strongest part of the advance," said Thomas Madden, who oversees $185 billion in investments as market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. "Investors will justifiably want to wait to see if there is good news on the economy and corporate profits grow." 
 Eastman Kodak was a drag on the Dow Jones industrial average after an analyst said declining photo-processing sales at a Kodak customer, Costco Wholesale, suggested slowing revenue for the company. 
The S.& P. 500 dropped 3.58 points, or 0.4 percent, to 949.64, while the Dow average lost 81.94 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,711.18. Both snapped a five-day winning streak, their longest rally in more than two months.
The Nasdaq composite index advanced 11.71 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,574.95 as computer-related shares climbed.
On Wednesday, the S.& P. 500 closed at its highest since Aug. 22 after reports showed gains in new-home sales and consumer confidence. A government report yesterday showed jobless claims stayed above 400,000 for a 15th week, a sign the economy is too weak to increase employment growth.
"The market has had a big move and the jobless numbers weren't good," said Jay Suskind, head of institutional equity trading at Ryan Beck & Company in New Jersey. "Maybe you want to cut back on your gainers."
Kodak dropped 82 cents, to $30.01. Photo-processing results at Costco, which handles as much as 15 percent of film processing in the United States under an exclusive contract with Kodak, fell in the third quarter, suggesting a sales decline for Kodak, Craig Ellis, a Smith Barney analyst, said in a note to clients.
Costco fell 72 cents, to $36.63. A Morgan Stanley analyst, Bruce Missett, downgraded the company, the large warehouse-club store chain, to equal-weight from overweight. He said the shares, which are up 31 percent since March 11, were fairly priced relative to earnings.
J. C. Penney dropped 59 cents, to $16.61. Standard & Poor's cut the company's debt to a junk rating.
Technology shares gained, lifting the Nasdaq for a fifth day, on expectations that companies that make computers, software and related equipment would be among the first beneficiaries of growth in the economy.
Companies in the S.& P. 500 Information Technology Index are expected to report a 30 percent earnings increase this year, according to a Thomson First Call survey of analysts. That is more than twice as fast the growth rate for all S.& P. 500 members.
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, rose $1.09, to $20.83. Cisco Systems, the biggest maker of equipment to direct Internet traffic, added 34 cents, to $16.62.
Treasury bond prices rose, after a government report showed jobless claims stayed above 400,000 for a 15th week, a sign the economy is too weak to increase employment growth.
Demand for government debt rose as some investors speculated Federal Reserve policy makers might cut their target interest rate of 1.25 percent. 
A new two-year note at auction was priced to yield 1.305 percent. In when-issued trading by late in the day the yield was 1.303 percent.
The benchmark 10-year note rose 23/32, to a price of 102 13/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.34 percent from 3.43 percent.
And the 30-year bond climbed 1 6/32, to 116 19/32. Its yield fell to 4.34 percent from 4.41 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

Co-ops Are Less Likely to Reject Buyers, Study Says

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Co-op boards are less likely to become entangled in lawsuits, less likely to reject prospective apartment buyers and more likely to trust building managers than they were in the mid-90's, when the co-op and condominium conversion movement was just passing its peak, according to a citywide sampling of the views of 200 board presidents.
 "What we're seeing is a maturation process; the boards have learned a great deal about running buildings," said Richard Siegler, a partner in the law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. Mr. Siegler along with Eva Talel, his colleague in the law firm's co-op and condo division, conducted the 48-question survey -- a follow-up to a similar study in 1996. 
 At least one prominent industry observer wondered whether the sampling was big enough and said he felt there might actually have been an increase in lawsuits. 
The 2003 study found, for example, that 71 percent of the buildings that responded had filed no lawsuits against apartment owners in the previous two years. Almost the opposite was true in 1996, when 67 percent of the boards reported filing suit against at least one apartment owner during the previous two years.
"That's a wow!" Ms. Talel said. "And it speaks to the maturation process, where boards are smarter, have experienced the costs and disruptions of litigation and are engaging in alternative dispute resolution -- good old-fashioned trying to work it out."
The same might be said of apartment owners. The current survey found that 83 percent of the boards had not been sued by owners in the last two years, while 54 percent of the boards in 1996 had not faced legal action during the previous two years.
The current study also found that 96 percent of the board presidents say that the companies that manage their buildings deal honestly with the buildings. "This increased from 88 percent in 1996," Mr. Siegler said, "suggesting limited fallout from the 1994 investigation of corruption in residential housing." The investigation, by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, "was Morgenthau's attempt to crack down on bribery between building managers and vendors," Mr. Siegler said, with buildings paying inflated contract costs to cover the bribes.
Ms. Talel said the 2003 study -- in which about half of the 200 respondents were in Manhattan -- went on to indicate that co-op boards were not as arbitrary as commonly perceived when it came to rejecting buyers. "We found in 2003 that for 66 percent of the buildings, fewer than 1 percent of the sales were turned down," she said. "And in '96, it was 56 percent. So you're seeing a decline in sales being disapproved." 
The survey delved into several financial issues. It found that 51 percent of the buildings had seen insurance costs jump by at least half since 2000, with 11 percent more than doubling. In 1996, 45 percent of the buildings required owners to post a security deposit if they were undertaking apartment alterations; by last year, that had increased to 70 percent.
In 1996, 13 percent of the buildings had more than 10 percent of their apartment owners in arrears on their monthly payments; by 2003, only 1 percent of the buildings had more than 10 percent of their apartments in arrears.
Noting that it was "difficult to extrapolate" results from 200 buildings for the 6,000 co-ops and condos in the city, Stuart M. Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said he thought there were now more lawsuits.
But the survey does provide "valuable additional information that confirms, to some degree, things we have seen," Mr. Saft added. "For instance, we believe that approximately 50 percent of cooperatives now have flip taxes, and the report indicates that 62 percent have them, confirming the numbers we have been using." Flip taxes -- fees paid by either the buyer or seller to the co-op when an apartment is sold -- have proliferated in a time of increased maintenance charges caused by higher property taxes, insurance and labor costs.
Mr. Saft noted that in the last few months, as co-op and condo boards held their annual elections: "We have seen more proxy fights for board control than at any time over the last 10 years. Many of these buildings are seemingly well run, so I think it's just the reaction of residents to those increased operating costs and the difficulty in the economy."

HEADLINE: City Unemployment Rate Drops; Statewide, Job Numbers Edge Up 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City dropped in April for the second time in two straight months, this time to 8.3 percent from 8.5 percent, according to monthly data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor. The number of private-sector jobs grew more than it had in many months.
 The city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said private-sector jobs in the city had increased by 10,700, when seasonally adjusted. He said the increase amounted to the largest single-month gain since September 2000. 
 Job gains were reported in construction, financial activities, education and health services, with losses in leisure and hospitality and in manufacturing.
Statewide, the number of private-sector jobs grew by 9,400 after seasonal adjustment, according to the Labor Department.
Several economists said the new numbers were somewhat encouraging. Some said they showed that the state economy was slowly recovering from the national recession, the troubled state of Wall Street and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In New York City, they said, the numbers suggest a leveling off after many months of decline.
"When things are bad, a little bit of good news is encouraging," said Jason Bram, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "The March numbers were looking bad. Now it looks a lot better. Not a boom, but a lot better. For now."
Stephen Kagann, the chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki, said in a statement: "The data show the New York State economy is slowly improving. Most regions are gaining jobs or are stronger than the nation, and the regions in decline are declining at a diminishing rate."
Employment growth in the New York City suburbs and upstate has outpaced that of the nation as a whole over the past year, Mr. Kagann said. Job losses have been concentrated in New York City, Rochester and Binghamton, but the rate of decline has slowed, he added.
Jim Brown, a labor market analyst for the state, said the new numbers showed "above-average strength" in construction and employment services. Those services, which include temporary agencies, are considered a barometer of business conditions.
Mr. Brown said the decline in New York City's April unemployment rate could be traced to actual employment gains rather than to a drop in the number of people seeking jobs, as had been the case in March.
The state's unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent from 6.0 percent.

HEADLINE: 1st-Quarter Growth Is Revised To a 1.9%Pace, Still Sluggish 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29 

 BODY:
The economy grew a bit faster in the first three months of 2003 than initially thought, the Commerce Department reported today, but the advance was still considered mediocre.
 A revision in the gross domestic product showed that economic growth increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the quarter, modestly stronger than the 1.6 percent growth rate estimated a month ago. 
 Economists said a growth rate around 3 percent or higher was needed to return to a more normal pattern and persuade companies to start hiring. "Until that happens, it won't feel much like an economic recovery to the average person," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified last week that growth this quarter "is going to be quite soft."
Many private economists do not expect the economy in this period to be much better than in January through March. Forecasts for second-quarter growth range from a 1 percent pace to more than 2 percent.
Economists are optimistic that activity will pick up in the second half of the year, with some predicting annual growth around 4 percent. "We think the recent rise in stock prices is already foreshadowing this revival," said Maury Harris of UBS Warburg.
A big reason for the higher first-quarter G.D.P. reading was that consumers spent a little more than previously thought.
Separately, new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week by a seasonally adjusted 9,000, to 424,000, the Labor Department said. Even with the decline, claims were above the 400,000 level, which is associated with a weak job market. The four-week moving average fell to 427,000 from 434,250.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: LAW ENFORCEMENT; 
U.S. Cautiously Begins to Seize Millions in Foreign Banks

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29 

 BODY:
The Justice Department has begun using its expanded counterterrorism powers to seize millions of dollars from foreign banks that do business in the United States, creating tensions with the State Department and some allies.
 Law enforcement officials say the tool has proved invaluable in seizing ill-gotten money that criminals hide overseas and that was once out of the government's reach. Under the counterterrorism measures approved by Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks, prosecutors are not even required to trace the money back to the target of an investigation. 
 Officials at the State Department, however, have raised concerns over the practice, in part because most of the seizures have involved fraud and money-laundering investigations that are unrelated to terrorism.
State Department officials worry "that this might be seen by other countries as arbitrary or trying to extra-territorially impose our laws" under the guise of fighting terrorism, said a Bush administration official who demanded anonymity. Diplomats from several nations, including Switzerland, have voiced private objections, officials said. 
The Justice Department has seized at least 15 foreign-based bank accounts in the United States in recent months, confiscating what prosecutors say they believe to be tainted money belonging to overseas banks in Israel, Oman, Taiwan, India, Belize and elsewhere, said law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Other seizures are also being considered, officials said. 
Justice Department officials acknowledged the diplomatic problems that can be created by seizing money from foreign banks, and they said they have sought to use the new power sparingly after considering all other legal options. 
The authority to seize ill-gotten foreign funds "is a very powerful tool and one that can affect our international relationships," said Bryan Sierra, a spokesman for the Justice Department. 
Mr. Sierra said that to protect the law enforcement relationships the United States has developed with governments around the world, the Justice Department "scrutinizes prosecutors' use of this provision before it is exercised."
The Justice Department has sent out guidance to prosecutors around the country about how to use the new power and has reached an informal understanding with the State Department to consult more extensively with officials there before seizing foreign money. State Department officials had complained that the Justice Department had kept them out of the loop in some cases.
"This is a process of last resort," said a senior law enforcement official. American diplomats "are worried about it, and we understand that, which is why we want to use this judiciously," said the official.
The State Department declined to comment on the issue. But a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged that there was still the potential for abuse in foreign seizures, despite the Justice Department's pledges to consider diplomatic issues in its decisions.
"From a diplomatic point of view, we've got concerns," the official said. "We're the ones who have to ensure diplomatic relations, and this complicates that."
Traditionally in money laundering and terror financing cases, federal authorities have worked through international law enforcement treaties in requesting that a country that is home to a foreign bank move to freeze "dirty money" and turn it over to the United States.
In countries with no treaty with the United States, American authorities say, their efforts often ran into dead ends. 
But a little-noticed provision in the sweeping antiterrorism legislation passed in October 2001, gave federal authorities in such cases the power to seize money that passes through banks in the United States without notifying the foreign government. Most overseas banks maintain what are called "correspondent accounts" in American banks, allowing them to exchange American currency and handle other financial transactions in this country. Section 319 of the Patriot Act, as the legislation that grew out of the Sept. 11 attacks is known, allows federal authorities to seize money from the foreign bank's correspondent account if they can convince a judge that the money deposited overseas at the bank was obtained illicitly.
Information about the seizures has been tightly guarded, and federal judges have sealed the records on most of them. The Justice Department acknowledged two cases in which the authorities have seized a total of more than $2 million from foreign banks but declined to give the total number of seizures. 
Law enforcement officials said the Justice Department had employed the new tool in about a half-dozen investigations, seizing money from at least 15 bank accounts. Most of those came in recent months and involved fraud and laundering cases, officials said. Law enforcement officials said some of the seizures have involved money that they suspect was helping to finance terrorism, but they declined to discuss details. Officials also see the measure as a potentially powerful tool in seizing money from drug traffickers.
In a case that resulted in a guilty plea in federal court this week, federal authorities seized $310,000 from four banks in the New York City area that held correspondent accounts with foreign banks in Oman, India, and Taiwan.
In seizing the money, the authorities charged that a Sudanese citizen in Brooklyn, Ahmed Abdu, had illegally wired more than $5 million to bank accounts around the world. It was the first time the seizure tool had been used by federal prosecutors in New York's Southern District. 
Mr. Abdu pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a charge of conspiring to run an unlicensed money transmitting business and faces up to five years in prison. The authorities seized the $310,000 from four banks in the New York City area that held correspondent accounts on behalf of overseas banks: Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank, and HSBC Bank USA.
"It was a strange thing for the banks," said a financial investigator with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York who spoke on condition of anonymity. "There was resistance initially, because they weren't exactly sure what to do. They'd never seen something like this before."
The seizure power has opened up doors once closed in financial crime investigations, the investigator said. "Now we can get ahold of money where we couldn't before," he said. "But we proceed very cautiously. It's such a powerful tool, you could knock the economy of a country on its head if it were a big enough case."
A seizure in Belize, centering on a lawyer and financial manager who was accused of embezzling money from his clients, has become a model for how the law can be applied, officials said. 
The lawyer, James Gibson, was accused of bilking clients out of millions of dollars and then fleeing to Central America. Prosecutors said that Mr. Gibson, indicted by a federal grand jury in 2001, deposited some of the money in banks in Belize.
Although the government of Belize initially agreed to freeze the money, a court there blocked the move, and prosecutors said they believed that Mr. Gibson and his wife were looting the accounts to buy yachts and other luxury items. 
But after the passage of the Patriot Act, the Justice Department moved within weeks in late 2001 to seize the money from the Belizean banks' correspondent accounts in the United States, according to a report prosecutors gave Congress last week on the new law enforcement powers.
Officials said that the money seized from Belize totaled about $1.7 million, and that it would be used to compensate Mr. Gibson's victims.
Charles A. Intriago, a specialist in money laundering law in Miami who publishes Money Laundering Alert, said he considered the Justice Department's new power to seize foreign bank accounts "maybe the most startling provision of the Patriot Act." He said: "It's an awesome power, and it may even go too far because of the diplomatic problems it could cause."
But Mr. Intriago added that he did not fault the Justice Department for considering the new tool in a range of fraud, laundering and drug trafficking cases that are unrelated to their counterterrorism mandate.
"If Congress had wanted this tool to be limited to terrorism, it would have done so," he said. "It didn't."

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The business software maker J. D. Edwards & Company posted a loss for the second quarter yesterday versus a profit a year earlier, as revenues dropped in the weak economy. The company said that it recorded growth in the number of customers, but that its transactions were smaller. 
For the quarter ended April 30, it posted a net loss of $393,000, compared with a profit of $3.5 million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The Denver-based company said that on a pro forma basis, excluding unusual costs, it earned a profit of $1.1 million, or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $7.6 million, or 6 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Total revenue declined to $203.5 million from $223.6 million the year before, the company said. License revenues fell to $43.6 million from $54.1 million a year earlier, while service revenues declined to $160 million from $169.5 million.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Special Visa's Use forTech Workers Is Challenged

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER and DANIEL PREYSMAN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 29 

 BODY:
With the economy in a slump, a growing number of American technology workers say their jobs are going not only to lower-cost foreign workers abroad, but also increasingly to workers who enter the United States under a little-known visa category known as L-1. 
 In the nearly three years since the technology bubble burst, the use of L-1 visas to bring in workers -- with a large percentage from India -- has become a popular strategy among firms seeking to cut labor costs. The number of these temporary visas granted rose nearly 40 percent to 57,700 in 2002 from 41,739 in 1999. 
 The visas are intended to allow companies to transfer employees from a foreign branch or subsidiary to company offices in the United States. But they are now routinely used by companies based in India and elsewhere to bring their workers into the United States and then contract them out to American companies -- in many instances to be replacements for American workers. The number of Americans who have been replaced by foreign contract workers is unknown. American companies that use contract workers have said that the decision to do so is based on factors like skills, and not on cost alone. 
Some immigration experts are questioning the legality of this use of the visa. Officials at the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, or B.C.I.S., a division of the Department of Homeland Security that oversees the granting of L-1 and other work visas, say the bureau is conducting an assessment of the L-1 visa to determine whether there is misuse. 
"If this is a company offering the services of their employee to go work for another company, it sounds dubious," said Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for B.C.I.S.
"To bring someone in ostensibly as an intracompany transfer and then put him to work for somebody else and then to say that we're paying him still, that just sounds like someone's trying to really stretch the envelope on that visa category," Mr. Strassberger said. 
The legal questions, however, remain murky. Steve Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell, said that strictly speaking, what these companies are doing is legal, though perhaps not what Congress intended. However, Mr. Yale-Loehr added, "If Congress is upset about this, then Congress will act on it."
In response to the controversy, Rep. John L. Mica, a Republican from Florida, introduced a bill this month to prevent companies from hiring foreigners with L-1 visas.
"When you have people using this to bring in lower-cost labor to displace Americans, it's something we need to address," Mr. Mica said in a telephone interview.
During the boom years, the technology industries successfully lobbied Congress to expand the number of foreign software engineers who could be permitted to fill programming needs in the United States. In 2000, Congress increased the annual cap on more restrictive temporary visas -- known as H-1B visas -- for highly skilled foreign workers to 195,000 from 115,000. That quota will drop automatically to 65,000 on Oct. 1 unless Congress approves an extension, a move that is considered unlikely.
In the last two years, the trend in the use of H-1B visas has declined sharply. Many experts say the use of L-1 visas will grow. 
Unlike the H-1B visa, the L-1 does not require employers to pay workers prevailing wages. In addition, there is no cap on the number of L-1 visas. 
This has ignited an outcry among technology workers who have lost jobs and say that foreign contract workers are paid substantially less than prevailing wages in the industry. 
Over the last three years, William O'Neill has seen his small computer consulting firm in East Granby, Conn., dwindle from six contract workers to none. The work itself has not disappeared, said Mr. O'Neill, but his clients, most of them large insurance companies in Connecticut and western Massachusetts, are turning to foreign companies, some with workers who are in the United States on temporary visas. Satyam Computer Services, a consulting firm based in India, for example, now has a contract with the Cigna Corporation that has around 100 Satyam employees working on computer applications management in Cigna offices. 
And as others have claimed, Mr. O'Neill said that in many cases, existing technology employees are asked to train their replacements. The L-1 visa requires that the foreign workers possess specialized knowledge of the work to be done. 
Mr. O'Neill said that the people he knows who are currently training their replacements will not talk about their situation for fear of losing what is left of their jobs. "They're scared to death they're going to lose their jobs instantly versus six or eight or nine months down the road," he said.
Once the replacement workers are trained, Mr. O'Neill said, the foreign workers are often sent back to India to do programming and computer work there for the American companies. 
Wipro, InfoSys and Tata Consultancy Services, all of them based in India, are other companies that are using L-1 visas to get workers into the United States.
Girish Surendran, a human resources manager who oversees immigration issues at Tata, said his company "is committed in letter and spirit to all the requirements and regulations of all visa categories." He added: "If workers are replaced, it's not that T.C.S. comes in and employees get let go." Mr. Surendran said he could not comment on a company's reason for laying workers off. 
Wipro plans to lobby against Mr. Mica's bill. If it becomes law, said Sridhar Ramasubbu, investor relations manager at Wipro, the company will simply turn back to H1-B visas. "We will not be affected financially because our compensation is the same whether somebody comes in under an H-1 or an L-1," Mr. Ramasubbu said. 
But trade groups representing American workers say the foreign workers are paid considerably less. "I have friends that were told in the last three months that they must take a $30,000 pay cut to keep their job," said John Bauman, president of the Organization for the Rights of American Workers, a nonprofit group based in Meriden, Conn.
Gary Burns, the legislative director for Mr. Mica, said there were about 325,000 L-1 visa holders in the United States. Those who stay in this country can remain for up to five or seven years, depending on the category of L-1 they hold. 
Some experts say that the use of L-1 visas for contract workers is not widespread and that fears of losing jobs to foreign workers are exaggerated. 
"Even if this brouhaha is about a real problem, I think when you look at the number of workers involved, it is a totally insignificant drop in a massive labor market," said Daryl Buffenstein, a immigration lawyer in Atlanta who has corporate clients and is general counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
Mr. Buffenstein said that those who oppose the L-1 visa do not understand how important it is for American industry. "It will hurt employment in the United States if we impede the ability of legitimate users to transfer managers and specialists between different affiliates of international organizations," said Mr. Buffenstein, a lawyer who advised legislators on the law governing L-1 visas.
Mr. Buffenstein said he was also worried that public overreaction would result in measures like the Mica bill, which he contended would go too far in restricting international companies from using L-1 visa holders to do on-site client work. 
Controversy over the visa, which has been in existence for 33 years, is not entirely new. Three years ago, the General Accounting Office reported that the the Immigration and Naturalization Services, the precursor to B.C.I.S., had found a high incidence of fraudulent use of L-1 visas and had called abuse of the visas "the new wave in alien smuggling."
But protest over the use of temporary foreign workers has become more vocal in a rocky economy. One 57-year-old computer consultant in Avon, Conn., who has been out of work for five months said, "This isn't just an I.T. issue," referring to the information technology industry.
"It's a big issue with multiple professions, and has a serious effect on the economy," said the consultant, who asked that his name not be used for fear of jeopardizing his chances to find work. "A lot of this is about the economy and the L-1 issue is just exacerbating the problem."

HEADLINE: Effort Begun To Cut Costs Of Insurance In Ireland 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
Since Shirley O'Kelly and her husband, Henry, started a wood processing business 20 years ago in the mountains south of Dublin, their company, O'Kelly Sawmills & the Shedman, has grown to annual revenues of more than $2 million. Its 24 employees make playgrounds, trellises and fencing for national parks like the Dublin Zoo. 
 In spring of 2002, Lloyd's of London refused to renew their 22,000 euro ($26,140) insurance policy two weeks before it expired. Desperate to find a replacement, they had trouble even getting a quotation from any insurer operating in Ireland, Ms. O'Kelly said. Eventually, 24 hours before their policy expired, they found a new one -- for 75,000 euros ($89,115). 
 "There was no negotiation whatsoever," Ms. O'Kelly said. "It was literally take it or leave it. Our profits just went to the insurance company. It's very, very disheartening." They might close the Shedman, she said, rather than pay that premium again. 
In a tough economic climate, Ireland's vibrant small-business sector is being strangled by the insurance policies that are meant to protect employers and employees in the case of workplace accidents, industry groups say.
Premiums have skyrocketed to levels several times the rates for comparable coverage elsewhere in Europe, with the increases attributed to everything from the Sept. 11 attacks to the emergence of an American-style "compensation culture." Now, with the insurance industry's blessing, the Irish government is promoting some extensive changes to the system of personal injury damages. 
"When a small company closes down, it's not just about the company, it's about 80 other people" in their families and other companies that depend on the business, said Pat Delaney, director of the Small Firms Association. "You start to see what the damage is below the waterline with high insurance costs." 
Insurance claims that cost small businesses $:1,600 to $:1,800 in England ($2,600 to $2,900), with an additional 5 percent for legal fees, can end up costing 12,000 to 16,000 euros ($14,200 to $19,000) in Ireland, with 42 percent more for legal fees, Mr. Delaney said. He wants Ireland to hold a constitutional referendum on limiting a citizen's right to sue. 
Over the last three years, premiums have nearly quadrupled for small companies, and have increased 470 percent for small engineering and manufacturing concerns, driving dozens of companies out of business, said Mark Fielding, chief executive of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association. Insurance company representatives did not dispute those figures. 
Local governments have also been hit hard, with rising insurance premiums forcing towns to scale back St. Patrick's Day parades, horse markets and other events. 
Tralee, in County Kerry on the west coast, has received so many claims from people who said they were injured by tripping on its sidewalks that the town tried publishing the names of claimants in a local newspaper advertisement, in hopes of deterring spurious claims or drawing out witnesses who could help the town disprove them.
The town's annual liability insurance bill has reached 1 million euros ($1.17 million), according to the ad -- some 8 percent of the town's budget, or enough to maintain all its parks for five years.
A lawyer for five people with claims against Tralee responded by suing the town for "libel by innuendo."
The insurance industry has done much to make insurance a hot topic in Ireland. Most major insurers have made a show of hiring new antifraud investigators, often retired police detectives, and a trade group has mounted an advertising campaign encouraging people to turn in neighbors who file bogus claims, arguing that fraud makes premiums higher for all policyholders. 
Mary Harney, deputy prime minister, has championed a broad package of changes, which should be passed into law and be put into effect by insurers before the end of 2003, a spokesman said. Ms. Harney has said that if all the changes are enacted, premiums will fall 31 percent across the board. (That figure "may be a bit optimistic," said Paul Moloney, a spokesman for AXA in Ireland.) 
The centerpiece of the package is the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, a body of legal and medical experts that will weigh injury claims and award compensation based on a set formula. Dissatisfied claimants could still appeal to the courts in hope of a higher award, but they would be required to present their case to the board first, and to swear an affidavit backing their claim, on penalty of perjury. 
The board "is not intended to reduce the awards to claimants," Gerry Donnelly, Ms. Harney's spokesman, said. "It is intended to reduce the cost of delivering those awards," by streamlining the process and keeping most cases out of court. 
Legal proceedings increase the cost of settling claims by an average of 40 percent, and the courts are so clogged that it takes six times as long for a case to get a hearing in Ireland as it does in England, said Dorothea Dowling, chairwoman of the assessment board. "The reality of the situation in Ireland is that successive political administrations have failed to tackle vested interests," she said. 
While Ireland has relatively few lawyers who specialize in personal injury claims, most lawyers say that the current system is fair, and that adding the board will only make it more bureaucratic. Both of the country's professional associations for lawyers have submitted alternative proposals to the government. 
The injuries assessment board "is coming at it from the outside looking in, and it's adding an extra layer without an understanding of what the problems are," said Conor Maguire, chairman of the Bar Council, one of the two associations. "There is a certain amount of smoke and mirrors" in Ms. Harney's calculations of how her changes will lower premiums, he said. 
A winnowing of the market has also resulted in fewer competitors to exert downward pressure on premiums, analysts say; five major insurers write almost all of the policies now, compared with nearly 20 a decade ago. "We're now in a part of the cycle where it must look pretty attractive for outsiders to come into the market here," said Michael Garvey, director of claims for Hibernian Insurance, Ireland's largest insurer and a division of the Aviva Group. 
International insurers are wary of Ireland because there is no separate bench of judges dedicated to hearing compensation claims, and the size of awards often varies wildly, Ms. Dowling said. A whiplash injury might result in an award of 10,000 euros ($11,800) from a judge in Dublin but 30,000 euros ($35,600) in the countryside, Mr. Garvey said, adding that awards for such "soft tissue" claims in Ireland tend to be four to six times those in England, which is used as a comparison because its business culture is similar.
Even with the insurance industry's cooperation, enacting the new laws will be difficult for the government, because many members of Parliament, which has yet to grant the injuries assessment board any legal powers, are themselves lawyers with a stake in the status quo, Ms. Dowling said. 
"There's now a national momentum to do something about this," Mr. Delaney said. "It was seen as something that only affected businesses, and it has made the quantum leap onto the societal stage."

HEADLINE: Brazil Economy Shows Growth From Year Ago 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 29 

 BODY:
Brazil's economy contracted 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2003 from the last three months of 2002, but it grew 2 percent from the comparable quarter a year earlier, the government reported today.
 The statistics came as a small relief to the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose economic policies and competence were major worries going into last year's elections. Many economists had expected the country's gross domestic product to be flat or shrink outright in the quarter, both from the period before and from the year before. 
 The agribusiness sector was the main bright spot, recording 3.7 percent growth, according to the government statistical agency, known as IBGE.
"It's good news for Lula," said John Welch, chief Latin American economist for WestLB in New York. "The first quarter this year included the Carnival and Easter holidays. If it hadn't, the numbers would have been even better." 
WestLB is forecasting annual growth of 2.5 percent to 2.7 percent this year for Brazil. "I think many people are being way too pessimistic on Brazilian growth," Mr. Welch said. 
Since Mr. da Silva took office on Jan. 1, his economic team has managed to stabilize the currency and rein in galloping inflation, but the ordinary Brazilians he pledged to help are still suffering from low pay and spiraling unemployment, and most experts say 2 percent growth is too slow to do them much good.
In Sao Paulo state, Brazil's industrial heartland, unemployment rose to a new high of 20 percent, the government said this week. 
Nevertheless, Brazil's national accounts are being bolstered by a growing trade surplus. The country's central bank said today that the country's public sector had posted a primary budget surplus of 9.85 billion reais ($3.32 billion) in April, the highest on record for a single month. In March, the surplus was 6.75 billion reais.

HEADLINE: Are You With Us? Are We Against You? 

BYLINE:  By Timothy Garton Ash; Timothy Garton Ash is director of the European Studies Center at St. Antony's College, Oxford, and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford.

DATELINE: WARSAW, Poland 

 BODY:
When President Bush speaks tomorrow in Krakow, Poland, he should give the whole of Europe this message: we, the United States, want a strong, coherent European Union. By the time he leaves the Group of 8 meeting in Evian, France, next Monday, European leaders should have responded with this message: we, the dynamically expanding European Union, want to define our new identity through a partnership with the United States, not through opposition to it.
 The future of the West depends on the clarity and conviction with which these two strategic messages are delivered. Of course, everyone will make some polite noises of this kind -- even Jacques Chirac, at which Tony Blair will doubtless take a large pinch of salt in his Evian water. But can the two sides convey to the other that they really believe it? Do they, in fact, believe it? 
 Since the president last visited Poland, in June 2001, each side of the Atlantic has given the other serious cause for doubt. Throughout the cold war, Western Europe could count on the United States as a consistent supporter of European integration. As the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the best single characterization of our common goal was given by President George H. W. Bush: "Europe whole and free." Yet Europe and America were no longer held together by the common enemy -- the Soviet threat -- and divergences of view increased in the 1990's. These, however, were kept in check by the liberal internationalism of the Clinton administration, and by the personality of Bill Clinton, himself a former Oxford student and, so to speak, an honorary European.
Of course, this changed sharply with the advent of the second Bush administration. In the crisis over Iraq, the West split down the middle. The dividing line, however, ran not down the Atlantic Ocean but through the heart of Europe, with the central part of the original European Community -- France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- opposing the United States over the Iraq war, while a sickle line of states -- Britain, Spain, Italy, Poland and most of the smaller countries in Central and Eastern Europe -- supported it. Or at least, their governments did.
Three things were new here. First, the extent of the disunity and the vehemence of the criticism were unmatched in even the worst trans-Atlantic disputes of the cold war. Second, in this larger Europe, including the post-Communist countries soon to join the European Union, there was a standoff between two groups of European states that were roughly balanced in power. Third, and crucially, Washington encouraged and exploited this division. 
Famously, Donald Rumsfeld remarked that the United States didn't need "old Europe" (that is, France and Germany) as allies in the Iraq war, when it had "new Europe" (the states on the sickle) on its side. If pro-American European states provided the sickle, Washington was the hammer.
Indeed, from the outset, the Bush administration was ideologically suspicious of international organizations and multilateral structures, of which the European Union is perhaps the world's most advanced exemplar. From the start, the administration had a tendency to work with a few favored nations in Europe: Britain, Poland, Spain, and -- until Gerhard Schroder blew it completely -- there might have been Germany. The United States military wasn't comfortable fighting the Kosovo war in a complex multilateral alliance. At the same time, Europe's growing economic strength has increased Washington's reluctance to endorse wholeheartedly a strong, integrated Europe. 
Asked to characterize Washington's current approach to Europe, a senior State Department official recently responded with one word: "disaggregation." That means favoring some countries, like Poland, and punishing others, like France. Or, as the Romans used to put it, "divide et impera," divide and rule. Today, with a single hyperpower and a larger, more complex Europe, the United States could certainly go on pursuing this classic imperial strategy. The question is, does it want to? Is it consonant with the values, history and habits of cooperation that Europe and America share? Is it in the United States' own long-term national interest, when the West as a whole faces such major challenges, in the Middle East and elsewhere?
Yet Europe also has to answer a hard question, and answer it frankly. Does it want to be a partner or a rival to the United States? There has always been a strong tradition in the mainstream of European integration, the Gaullist tradition, which saw a strong Europe, in close partnership with Russia, as a counterbalance to the hegemony of "les Anglo-Saxons." In the Iraq crisis, aided by a weak and confused German leadership, Jacques Chirac produced a crude, reach-me-down version of this Gaullist vision, in the Paris-Berlin-Moscow axis of refusal. But there are deeper forces pushing in this direction too. 
For 50 years, democratic, integrating Europe defined itself against two sinister Others -- the Soviet Union, and Europe's own bloody past. Now the Soviet Union is gone and most Europeans are too young and ignorant of history for the memory of that bloody past to be a psychological driving force of integration. So Europeans are casting around for another Other, against which to define the enlarged European Union -- which is trying to give itself a new constitution and a clearer identity. Significantly helped by George W. Bush, and even more by the European caricature of him as a Texan cowboy, many have found the new Other in the United States.
Strong claims are made about the qualitative differences between an American model of a brutally individualistic "market society" and a European model of social solidarity and the welfare state. Some suggest that one can identify a set of "European values" that are quite distinctive from, and better than, American ones. Robert Kagan's brilliant neo-conservative caricature of Americans as warlike Hobbesians and Europeans as pacifist Kantians is warmly greeted by the anti-American European left. Altogether, Europeans like to wallow in what Sigmund Freud called "the narcissism of minor difference." So Europe, like the United States, has a very serious temptation it must resist.
These are profound, strategic choices for both sides. There's no point in pretending they don't exist for the sake of a smiling group photo. Each side's answer to its big question obviously depends on the other's. In the memorable words of Ronald Reagan, another American president whom Europeans loved to caricature, but who ended up paving the way to our Europe whole and free: it takes two to tango.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 7, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article on May 30, about differences between Europe and the United States over the war in Iraq, mischaracterized the Dutch position on the war. While the Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, did not sign the "letter of eight" European leaders expressing support for the United States, he later said he backed American action against Iraq.

HEADLINE: Minsk Journal; 
On Destined Way to Dallas, Oswald Tarried Here

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MINSK, Belarus, May 22 

 BODY:
The ornate apartment building at No. 2 Communist Street rises beside a wooded park along a wide bend in the Svisloch River. The balcony of Apartment 24, on the fourth floor, overlooks the trees and the water and, in the distance, the classically columned Ministry of Defense. 
 It is a lovely spot, especially now, in spring, but one that bears no outward sign of its link to the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas. 
 There is no plaque that announces, "Lee Harvey Oswald Lived Here." 
For those whose historical curiosity -- or conspiratorial bent -- brings them to the capital of Belarus, the landmarks of Oswald's strange life here from January 1960 to May 1962 remain in some ways remarkably unchanged four decades later. 
The sprawling factory where Oswald worked still produces radios and other electronics. It is still state-owned and, today like then, remains closed to visitors.
The K.G.B. -- still called the K.G.B. -- still operates the club where Oswald liked to dance, and the club is still named after Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the father of the Soviet secret police.
Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959, inspired by romantic notions of a workers' paradise, only to become disillusioned later and return home, more than a year before President Kennedy's assassination.
The authorities -- deeply suspicious and evidently unsure what to do with a troubled young American -- sent him to Minsk, a regional capital rebuilding itself in monumental Soviet style from the ruins of World War II. They gave him a job at the radio factory and the apartment on Communist Street and kept him under constant surveillance.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the K.G.B. in Moscow and here in Belarus opened their files to public scrutiny, most notably to Norman Mailer, who used much of the material in his biography, "Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery" (Random House, 1995). In 1999, President Boris N. Yeltsin gave President Clinton more declassified documents.
The files, most historians have agreed, support the Soviet Union's claim at the time that it had no role in the assassination, but here as elsewhere conspiracy theories thrive, nurtured by distrust of authority and suspicions that other files remain untapped.
"From what I found out, I'm pretty sure what was written in the Warren Commission was just a cover-up of what really happened," said Oleg P. Belousov, who helped make a documentary film based on interviews with those who knew and worked with Oswald during his 28 months in Minsk. It was not, he noted conspiratorially, shown on Belarussian television.
Mr. Belousov, a bearded and bespectacled man, has made a cottage industry out of Oswald's past here. (As conspiracy theories go, he favors one that holds Oswald to have been an unwitting stooge of both the C.I.A. and the K.G.B.) 
The truth, he said, may yet be found here.
"It's absolutely clear that Minsk's role in the whole affair has been underestimated," he said.
It is certainly not advertised. 
There are no exhibits, no Oswald tours by the state tourist agencies, Sputnik and Intourist, which have retained not only their Soviet names but also regained, under President Aleksandr Lukashenko's centralized economic policies, most of their monopolistic privileges.
"No one asks," said Svetlana S. Lubova, a youthful guide at Sputnik,when asked.
Even so, Oswald's presence lingers in the minds of those who knew him here and in the places he frequented.
Stanislav S. Shushkevich, the first leader of independent Belarus, who was ousted in 1994 in a political struggle that brought Mr. Lukashenko to power, worked at the factory with Oswald, then called the Minsk Radio Factory.
Mr. Shushkevich was assigned to teach him Russian. In an interview, he recalled Oswald as a handsome, but hapless worker who devoted most of his time to socializing with factory workers. 
"The only secret was the reason why he came over here," he said. "We weren't allowed to ask him about that."
Despite the veneer of a new era -- there is a designer clothing store, for example, on the first floor of the apartment building on Communist Street -- little about Minsk has changed, for better and worse.
Oswald's apartment building once belonged to the radio factory, housing its workers. Across the street is a recreation of the wooden building in which the first meeting of what would become the Communist Party took place in 1898. Around the corner is the apartment building on Victory Square where the woman he married, Marina N. Prusakova, lived. 
Oswald's apartment is small, with only one room, a kitchen and a bathroom. Eduard K. Sagyndykov, 67, lives there now. He bought it two years ago for $13,000. Only afterward did he learn its notoriety, a discovery that troubled him, but not for long.
Many of the apartment's fixtures -- the iron bathtub, the ancient toilet -- are those Oswald knew. The closet has a thin shelf hidden in the darkness near the top. Mr. Sagyndykov can only guess what Oswald kept there.
Mr. Sagyndykov said his son suggested turning his apartment into a museum, but he considered it a joke. Who would come?

HEADLINE: Criticism Takes Toll on South Korean Leader 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 29 

 BODY:
Barely three months into his five-year term, President Roh Moo Hyun is fighting for his political life. 
 He spent the better part of an hour in a hastily organized nationally televised news conference here on Wednesday night fending off accusations of corruption involving real estate and using political influence in business. 
 Mr. Roh said he had committed no illegal acts and later in the news conference he made an extraordinary plea for the public's trust. 
"I will accept any reprimand for any wrongdoing, but I earnestly appeal to you to not exhaust us anymore with wasteful debate," he said. 
Judging from the recent weeks of almost unrelenting bad news for Mr. Roh, however, the prospects of a swift end to the debate seem slight. News media coverage today was strongly skeptical, with the headline of one typical editorial, in The JoongAng Ilbo, saying, "The questions not answered." 
South Korea is famously a country of people in a hurry, with a cutthroat political culture. But the speed with which the knives have been drawn against Mr. Roh has surprised many here, no one more than Mr. Roh himself. He recently expressed misgivings about the presidency itself and wondered -- but only rhetorically, his aides insist -- whether he would be able to continue in the job. 
"Recently, the problems I've been facing are too difficult," Mr. Roh was widely reported to have said last week at a meeting. "The nation's functions have become paralyzed, because everyone is trying to resolve things with their strength. A president cannot concede to everything. With all this strain, I am beginning to think I can no longer be the president." 
The list of woes he has faced would be daunting for any politician. He came into office amid a crisis in relations with the country's most important ally, the United States, and quickly faced sharp doubts in the conservative press here over whether he was up to simultaneously managing both the widening cracks in the alliance and a simmering crisis with North Korea. 
Quickly added to these troubles were the corruption investigations involving some longtime associates, and worse, his older brother. The president was accused of masking real estate investments under his brother's name and using his political influence to advance an associate's interest in a water company that is no longer in business. 
Political analysts here say the accusations are especially damaging, even if they are not borne out, for a politician who has carefully built an image as a crusader for social and economic justice and as a champion of the common man. 
In the view of many, Mr. Roh exceeded expectations during a recent trip to Washington, his first visit to America, where he met with President Bush, and strongly reaffirmed South Korea's attachment to its 50-year-old alliance with the United States. 
What might have been a diplomatic triumph, or even the beginnings of a reputation for statesmanship, however, quickly turned into a political debacle at home, when leftist student groups and others quickly castigated Mr. Roh for supposedly caving in to Washington after campaigning on the theme of greater independence in foreign policy and defense matters.
"It is worth remembering that Roh is only the fourth democratically elected president this country has had, and it seems the speed with which the press goes for the jugular has increased with every transition," said Michael Breen, a Korea expert who is writing a biography of Mr. Roh's predecessor, Kim Dae Jung. 
"With Roh there has never been any honeymoon whatsoever. There is no more fear of the president here. People feel they can stand up and say whatever they want and not have to look over their shoulder when they are driving home in the evening." 
What is worse, not quite 100 days into the job, Mr. Roh's comments about whether he was fit for the job have prompted many Koreans to openly wonder if the 56-year-old labor lawyer has the right stuff.
A relative unknown, with only a single term in Parliament and a junior cabinet position in his political resume, Mr. Roh emerged as a surprise winner in a three-way election last December. He has cast himself as the ultimate outsider, a man whose campaign was paid for by "coin in the cup" contributions by the Korean people. His aides, pointing to the way Mr. Roh -- too poor to afford law school -- passed the bar through his own disciplined study, have depicted him as a Korean Abraham Lincoln. 
More recently, however, even some of Mr. Roh's appointees have wondered privately whether he is in over his head. 
"There are a great many issues that he simply doesn't grasp," said one senior official. "For now, though, he deserves the benefit of the doubt because he knows what he doesn't know. He is humble, and more than willing to listen." 
Ben Q. Limb, who advised Mr. Roh on foreign policy during the campaign, said, "I wouldn't characterize him as naive, but rather very sophisticated." 
Still, he said, the presidency is something that is new to any political leader, no matter how much he claims to be prepared. 
"If President Roh has not won the hearts of a broad majority of the people, it is because this country is being democratized much more quickly than the Korean people themselves realize. That means there's criticism from every quarter."

HEADLINE: Security Worries May Cut French Host Town's Profits 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: EVIAN-LES-BAINS, France 

 BODY:
Jacques Burnet plans to welcome world leaders and their trailing delegates, staff, journalists and spouses this weekend -- with open arms and hundreds of French-made Mephisto walking shoes.
 "Mephisto isn't considered very chic in France, but we know the Americans love Mephisto," said Mr. Burnet, 51, president of the Federation of Economic Actors of Evian -- and the owner of its main shoe store. "They're a lot less expensive here. So I ordered what I could. For five days we'll be the capital of the world, and my goal is to seize the day." 
 Mr. Burnet may be sorely disappointed. American and other foreign customers may not be coming. For security reasons, the French government has decided to seal off Evian from the rest of the world for the three-day extravaganza that opens on Sunday. Even daily commuters and the town's 7,500 residents will have to carry special numbered badges to get past heavy armor and police barricades into the town itself.
President Jacques Chirac chose well in selecting Evian for the annual summit meeting of the Group of 8, the organization of leading economic powers. One of the most serene settings in Europe and the natural source of the world-famous mineral water, the picture-perfect town is protected on one side by some of the highest mountains of the Alps and by Lake Geneva on the other.
Despite the deep chill between Mr. Chirac and President Bush over France's refusal to back the American-led war in Iraq, the two presidents have talked about security at the economic meeting.
In a phone conversation in mid-April, Mr. Bush asked Mr. Chirac if there would be protest demonstrations, and Mr. Chirac responded, according to officials familiar with the conversation, that even if there were, all necessary security measures had been taken. When Mr. Bush joked that he expected a big protest because of his presence, Mr. Chirac joked back that if he really wanted one, it could be arranged.
Marc Francina, the mayor of Evian, has already tried to ease tensions between France and the United States, sending Mr. Bush a six-bottle pack of Evian water in one-liter, tear-drop-shaped collector's bottles. He proudly showed off the letter signed by Mr. Bush that thanked him for the "commemorative glass bottle of water."
In the town, roving teams of French gendarmes in dark glasses and even darker uniforms patrol the streets and the manicured gardens of the Royal Parc Evian, a spa hotel complex and its 41-acre grounds that will serve as the meeting's headquarters. The officers are part of a French security and emergency force of 11,000 overall.
The town and the central government have split the cost of building a $400,000 all-grass level field large enough to accommodate the helicopter that will ferry Mr. Bush from the Geneva airport.
Surface-to-air missile batteries and radar warning systems have been deployed to keep unauthorized aircraft away. Special naval police units of armed boats and expert swimmers will bar private boats from the lake. Police mountaineers will search for terrorists on paragliders. Communications antennas have been installed on roofs so the security forces can talk to each other more easily.
The Belle-Epoque hotel overlooking the lake, built almost a century ago, once housed German and Italian and later American soldiers wounded during World War II. There is a royal suite named after King Edward VII -- even though he died before he could visit. Hotel officials refused to say which head of state will have access to it.
While France revels in the glory of playing host to a score of world leaders in total, Switzerland, its next-door neighbor, will have to police the protesters -- possibly hundreds of thousands of them -- expected this weekend.
The Swiss have also been assigned the task of housing and protecting a dozen world leaders from countries like China, India, Brazil and Mexico who have been invited to participate in the opening of the summit meeting but not to stay at the main house on French territory.
In Geneva, 30 miles and an hour's drive away from Evian, there are images that echo the G-8 summit meeting in Genoa two years ago when a young demonstrator was shot dead by the police and of the largest anti-Iraqi war protests in Switzerland.
Merchants have started to board up their shops and to prepare to extend the Ascension Thursday holiday into a five- or six-day break. Much of Geneva, including the area around the United Nations offices and the World Trade Organization, will be closed off.
"We don't understand at all why we have to suffer for something that is being done in France," said Liliane Sicard, the owner of a jewelry store just off the upscale Rue du Rhone, who is putting up plywood on her front windows and leaving town. "We're frightened. We don't know who is coming, how many and who will do what."
"The police will be so busy with the protesters that all the robbers will come into our apartments," she said. "There are gypsies and robbers coming from Lyon. Many people are staying in town only to protect their homes."
Banks in the downtown plan to either remove or shut down automatic teller machines to make them less tempting for vandals. Senior high school students in Geneva have been forced to take their comprehensive exams a week early.
At the weekly used and rare book market at the Place de la Fusterie, booksellers said they would not open this weekend. "I do this job for pleasure not money, so I'll stay home," said Nelly Fiaux, who specializes in old prints. "If they knock on my door asking for food, I'll feed them." 
Massive demonstrations and marches will be accompanied by what the demonstrators have dubbed Operation "Fire on the Lake" that will lighting up "protest fires" around Lake Geneva.
Andre Hediger, the leftist mayor of Geneva, is unhappy about what he called "all the anxieties and worries" brought on by the meeting in France. Still, he has decided to work with the protesters. Special camping sites have been built for them with food and toilet facilities on the outskirts of the city. Flags of the city of Geneva and flags with the word "Peace" have been hung along Pont de Mont Blanc, the bridge that links the right and left banks of the city.
More controversially, the Swiss government in Bern has called on Germany to send in 1,000 reinforcements to help the 4,000 Swiss police officers and 5,600 Swiss soldiers assigned to the summit.
Because of cultural sensitivities, Mr. Hediger said, the Germans will be deployed in neutral areas like the international airport and not be called on to police the protesters. "We cannot have the Germans in the streets," he said.

HEADLINE: The Tax Bill's Final Indignity 

 BODY:
The tax bill that President Bush triumphantly signed into law on Wednesday is not just unfair, dishonest and economically unsound. It is also cruel to low-income families. In a last-minute revision, Senate and House negotiators dropped a provision that would have extended child tax credits to millions of these families. The stated reason was that the total cost of the bill had to be kept to an agreed-upon limit of $350 billion. This excuse is typical of the shifty argumentation that has accompanied this legislation from the start. 
 Under the new law, which raises the child tax credit to $1,000 from $600, most families with children will receive a $400-per-child check this summer. It was never intended that the wealthiest families -- or the very poorest families, making less than the minimum wage -- would get the credit. As it turns out, however, millions of families with incomes between $10,500 and $26,625 will not get it either. Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, had insisted that the Senate version of the bill extend the enlarged credit to this particular group of working families, who have nearly 12 million children. The provision would have cost $3.5 billion, or exactly 1 percent of the advertised price of the bill. But because it would have helped push the tab above $350 billion, out it went. 
 Set aside for the moment the fact that the official $350 billion figure is a phony. The real cost of the bill over 10 years will more nearly approximate $800 billion if all the provisions that are scheduled to "sunset" in the next few years are eventually made a permanent part of the tax code, as they almost certainly will be. But even if the cost of the bill were actually $350 billion, there were fairer ways to reach that target than by depriving low-income families of the tiny crumbs the bill gives them.
For example, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the same result could have been achieved with a modest 2.3 percent adjustment in the bill's generous cuts on capital gains and dividends. It could also have been achieved by a tiny adjustment in the new top income tax rate, setting it at 35.3 percent over the next three years rather than 35 percent.
Senator Lincoln understandably feels betrayed. She also notes that the families who will no longer benefit badly need the money and would have spent it quickly, thus providing Mr. Bush with the stimulus he says he wants and which the rest of the bill may not reliably provide.
Some senators and interest groups are now urging President Bush to rectify this injustice, a change that would presumably require separate legislation. Given all the other problems with this bill, it seems the least he can do.

HEADLINE: Bush Off on Road Today, To Europe 'Old' and 'New' 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29 

 BODY:
President Bush leaves Friday for his first meeting with the leaders of France and Germany since their battles over the Iraq war, but officials on both sides are saying that the three combustible personalities are unlikely to do more than paper over the deep fissures between the "old" Europe and theUnited States.
 Diplomats noted that Mr. Bush had chosen not France or Germany but Poland, a supporter of the American-led invasion of Iraq and a crucial part of what he considers the "new" Europe, as the place to deliver his keynote European address on the future of the trans-Atlantic alliance. 
 Mr. Bush has also cut short his stay, from two days to one, at a meeting of the world's leading industrialized nations in Evian, France. His reason is that he must leave early for Middle East meetings with Arab leaders and then the Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers. 
"When I say something, we actually go do it," Mr. Bush told an interviewer from Nile-TV, an Egyptian network. "And when I say that I'm going to be involved in the peace process, I mean I'm going to be involved in the peace process."
In another interview, he made clear that the United States and France still had a troubled relationship.
He told the French newspaper Le Figaro today, in an interview to be published on Friday, that he expected to have a "good discussion" at Evian with the French president, Jacques Chirac.
At the same time he warned that French leaders "must work to convince their own citizens and show that France is ready to cooperate with the United States."
Nonetheless, Mr. Bush said that Evian "will not be a summit of confrontation" and that "it will be a pleasure to talk with Jacques Chirac." He added, "Vive la France."
Mr. Bush has a half-hour meeting on Monday with Mr. Chirac, the host of Evian. The agenda calls for discussions on the Middle East, AIDS, and the reconstruction of Iraq, but foreign policy experts say that the agenda will be overshadowed by the body language as will Mr. Bush's encounter with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, which will take place in a group.
"It could be a Kumbaya-like get-together with everyone holding hands and committed to forgetting about the past," said Ivo H. Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a director of European Affairs on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton. "But more likely, it will be a schoolyard with bullies on opposite sides glaring at each other and still angry about the fight they just had."
Earlier this month, Mr. Bush acknowledged that the summit meeting would be seen as a gathering of warring egos rather than a triumph of substance when he told a German delegation visiting the White House that he knew that every public moment he spent with Mr. Schroder would be under scrutiny.
"I know that when we meet all the the television crews will be watching to see if we get into a fistfight -- and we won't," one German visitor quoted the president as saying. Such is the state of Mr. Bush's relationship with Mr. Schroder that the delegation interpreted the remark as conciliatory.
Officially, the White House says that Evian will be about the future of the trans-Atlantic relationship and that the leaders will work together to combat terrorism and the sagging world economy. The trans-Atlantic split over Iraq is past, they insist -- just another squabble, to use Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's favored metaphor, in a marriage that has been in counseling for 200 years.
"I imagine that in marriage counseling the first thing you don't do is, item one, get up and over coffee talk about the fight you had last week," said a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the trip this week. "That probably doesn't strike me as the best way to build the relationship of the future. You talk about the chores you need to do together that day. And the relationship then starts righting itself, so to speak."
Unofficially, administration officials say that Mr. Bush is still angry with Mr. Chirac for working against the United States on the Iraq war and that he will never again trust Mr. Schroder for campaigning on an antiwar -- and, they say, anti-American -- platform in Germany last fall.
Administration officials now view Mr. Bush's Evian trip as an obligation wedged among the other appearances -- the speech in Krakow, Poland. a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the 300th anniversary celebration of St. Petersburg and the three-way summit conference in Jordan. 
White House officials say that it is no accident that Mr. Bush chose Poland. President Aleksander Kwasniewski committed 200 Polish troops to the Iraq war and he will now be the most recent leader to be thanked for supporting Mr. Bush's view of the world.
Scholars note, however, that Poland and other Eastern European nations of Mr. Bush's "new" Europe date back further than nations like Germany, which Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld infamously derided before the Iraq war as part of the "old" Europe, along with France.
"They're all old -- Europe is old," Mr. Daalder said. "In that sense, it's nonsensical. There are countries that are now members of the 'new' Europe that predate countries of the 'old' Europe. Germany was unified and became a single state long after Poland was an independent country."
Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United States, said today that Mr. Bush and Mr. Chirac had a "positive, relaxed" 10-minute phone conversation earlier this month in preparation for Evian, and that they "want to go beyond the bitterness of the past."
Mr. Levitte said that France did not see its role as serving as a check on American power in the world.
"Our problem is that there is not enough European military capacity," he said. "It has nothing to do with the supposed desire of France to limit American power."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Some Candidates Quick to Urge Tax-Cut Repeal

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29 

 BODY:
Tax cuts have returned as a central issue in presidential politics. But this time Democratic candidates are aggressively challenging tax reductions with a directness not seen since the 1980's.
 A day after President Bush signed the latest round of tax cuts into law -- which the White House has promoted as the centerpiece of his program to revive the economy -- four Democratic presidential candidates said they would campaign on a promise to repeal some or all of the tax cuts passed since Mr. Bush took office. They described the reductions as destructive to an already faltering economy and a squandering of scarce resources. 
 In a conference telephone call with reporters, Senator Bob Graham of Florida said today that he would push to repeal the tax-cut package Mr. Bush signed on Wednesday that has been valued at $350 billion over 10 years. Senator Graham described the cuts as "irresponsible." 
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said he would repeal tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which he dismissed as "inappropriate and unconscionable at a time when we have all these needs before us."
Dr. Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, issued a statement saying that he would repeal every tax cut passed during Mr. Bush's term. That was a switch from his previous position; Dr. Dean had said he would roll back tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
"It really does set up a real debate over something big and important for people," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said in an interview today.
Mr. Gephardt has been calling for the repeal of all the Bush administration's tax cuts to finance national health care coverage. "This is a clear choice for people," he said.
Mr. Bush's advisers invoked the tax cuts today as the foundation of an administration program that would spur economic and job growth, and said they welcomed Democratic efforts to run against the cuts.
Several Republicans argued that the image of Mr. Bush signing the tax cut bill would undercut any efforts by Democrats to present him as unconcerned about the nation's economy, the way Bill Clinton did in 1992 against Mr. Bush's father.
"When you talk to the voters, they believe the president is doing this in order to improve the economy," said Matt Dowd, a pollster who is a senior adviser to Mr. Bush's re-election campaign. "They believe he is doing this because he thinks it will move the economy forward. Even voters who don't support the president's tax cuts think that."
The maneuvering on both sides signaled that the debate about tax cuts could become the most sharply defined on the subject since 1984, when Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic candidate, ran on a specific pledge to raise taxes to erase a deficit that had ballooned after President Ronald Reagan pushed through a tax cut.
Mr. Mondale went on to lose 49 states, an outcome that has served as a cautionary tale for Democratic candidates -- and an inspirational one for Republicans -- ever since.
In 1992, Mr. Clinton, then the Democratic presidential candidate, proposed a tax increase for the highest-earning Americans. But that proposal was mostly lost under the shadow of his promise to provide a tax cut for all middle-class Americans.
Still, emphasizing tax cuts as a campaign issue presents risks for both sides. Democrats -- or at least those who have chosen to take Mr. Bush on about them -- are embracing the very issue that Republicans have used skillfully against them for years. But if the economy continues to decline a year from now, Democrats contended today, it would be that much easier to blame Mr. Bush -- and the tax cuts he has pushed -- for the nation's economic woes. 
To a certain extent, the Democrats have been forced into this position by the success Mr. Bush enjoyed in achieving this latest tax cut package, which accelerated the institution of tax cuts scheduled to take place over the next few years. 
In describing the spending programs they have promoted in their primary campaigns, Democratic candidates had repeatedly said they would suspend tax cuts that had not yet taken effect -- an option they no longer have.
Republicans today clearly took delight in watching Mr. Bush's opponents maneuver in response to the bill. "We always urge the Democrats to skate out on the thin ice of tax increases," a senior administration official said. "What appeals to the base alienates the center."
Given that, Democrats are not unified in how to respond to this tax cut. Some candidates are trying to avoid choosing between the social-spending demands of primary voters and the concerns of the general electorate, which, polls show, is much more inclined to support the tax cuts. 
"This field is definitely going to split into people who are solely focused in the primary and people who also want to preserve their viability in a general election," an adviser to one Democratic candidate said. "Calling for tax increases -- especially those that might fall on the middle class -- is not the best way to do that."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut issued a statement ducking the question of whether he would support repealing the tax cuts. He said he wanted to study the legislation as "just one part of our economic growth plan." He declined a request for an interview.
Similarly, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina issued a statement saying that some elements of the tax cut would have to be repealed. But an aide said Mr. Edwards had not yet determined which ones. The senator also declined a request for an interview.
Mr. Gephardt and Dr. Dean advocated rolling back all the tax cuts. "I now realize that the president's plan is so bad for the country that the right thing to do is just to repeal all the tax cuts," Dr. Dean said, explaining his revised position.
Mr. Kerry and Mr. Graham called for retaining tax cuts that were already in place, and those intended for the middle class.
"Their sense of priority is just warped," Mr. Kerry said of the White House. "I'm for what I think helps the middle class and helps kick our economy into gear."
Advisers to Democratic candidates said today that given the growth of deficits since Mr. Bush took office, the public would be much less accepting of tax cuts.
Democrats -- particularly Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Kerry -- have taken pains not to present their position as a choice between tax cuts or no tax cuts. Instead they frame it as a choice between, for example, cutting taxes or offering health care coverage. Even Republicans acknowledged that such arguments could prove effective.
Still, Democratic strategists said the candidates were taking a considerable risk in advocating a flat repeal of Mr. Bush's tax cut. They might be better off, the strategists suggested, to take a page from Mr. Clinton and mix up their tax increases with a few tax cuts.
"It's probably wiser to be both very clear on which of the tax cuts that have passed you support, and yet very courageous on which of the tax cuts are excessive and need to be rolled back," said Gene Sperling, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Clinton in his 1992 campaign and in the White House. "Then the message is not for or against tax cuts."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE OCCUPATION; 
G.I.'s in a Desert Town Face Rising Iraqi Hostility

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: HIT, Iraq, May 29 

 BODY:
Capt. Andrew Watson of Carson City, Nev., removed his helmet and mopped the sweat off his head this afternoon as he stood at the gate of his dusty encampment and puzzled over what had prompted the rioting, grenade throwing and arson on Wednesday in this little desert town that falls within his "A.O.," or area of operations.
 "We have taken great pains to be aware of cultural differences," he said. "We do not want to be ugly Americans. We are here to be a friend." 
 But the challenges now facing the American occupation of Iraq exploded here this week when a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at one of Captain Watson's convoys on Tuesday in this desert speck of a town 90 miles northwest of Baghdad. 
Soldiers of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment responded by bringing local policemen into one of Hit's neighborhoods and conducting house-to-house searches, according to residents and military officials. 
The residents say the soldiers kicked down doors and climbed over walls at other homes while an assault helicopter circled above the neighborhood.
Word spread like a prairie fire across the city that American soldiers had burst in on the Muslim women of Hit, catching them in various states of immodest cover.
"We are Muslims, and we don't allow people to trespass on our property and go into our houses and search our women," one angry resident said today. He would identify himself only as Abu Ahmed, age 37.
In this way, it seems, the earnest American quest to be sensitive to cultural differences can quickly turn to misunderstanding and violence in a country still nervous and restive after the fall of Saddam Hussein.
On Wednesday, American soldiers returned to the police station to talk with the local authorities about security. A crowd gathered and pelted the station with stones. Then someone threw a hand grenade over the wall of the police compound. Two soldiers suffered minor wounds, and reinforcements raced to the scene. 
"The citizens didn't accept the behavior of the Americans," an elderly resident in a white robe said in unaccented English that he learned while a student at a technical institute in St. Louis in the 1960's.
The crowd grew. The soldiers formed a cordon with their guns aimed outward as they evacuated their wounded, witnesses said. Warning shots rang out. One local man said he had been shot through the leg. When the troops retreated, the crowded rioted for hours, burning the municipal building and the police station in protest at what was viewed as the "collaboration" of the police.
It was one of a series of attacks this week in which six American soldiers were killed and a dozen wounded, most in central Iraq. 
The violence has underscored the challenges American troops face as they take over many of the functions of a national police force in Iraq. The injuries in Hit were minor compared with other attacks this week.
But confrontations like the one in Hit could multiply as allied forces begin enforcing a tough gun-collection program after June 1. 
Until this week, the war had passed over this industrial town. There was no bombing here during the military campaign and no looting afterward, the town elders say.
Many men threw their weapons into the blue waters of the Euphrates River three weeks ago and welcomed the Americans who finally showed up promising the return of economic life. 
But today, the municipal building and the police station are smoldering wrecks. A vigilante with an AK-47 stood guard as if to tell the Americans that they are in for a fight if they return.
After attacks on convoys that killed five Americans this week, a sixth soldier was killed today, military officials said, when "hostile fire" was directed at a convoy on the main supply route from Kuwait near the town of Anaconda. The unidentified soldier was pronounced dead at the 21st Combat Support Hospital, a military statement said.
Late Wednesday, American troops opened fire on an Iraqi civilian vehicle in Samarra, killing two people and wounding two others. Military officials said the vehicle had failed to stop at a roadblock.
While the level of alarm over convoy attacks was rising, American officials acknowledged today that they had mistakenly released from a military internment camp a suspected mass murderer believed to be responsible for the deaths of thousands of Iraqi Shiites in 1991. 
The suspect, Muhammad Jawad an-Neifus, was released on May 18 from the Bucca internment facility at Umm Qasr, officials said. He has been accused of helping the Iraqi Army kill thousands of people during Mr. Hussein's repression of a Shiite rebellion in southern Iraq at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
Known as Sheik an-Neifus by the residents of Hilla, the site of one of the largest mass graves discovered so far, he was arrested by marines on April 26 and then turned over to the Army military police on April 29, the statement said.
"When he appeared for his initial screening, there was nothing unusual about the story he told," the statement added, indicating that his "true identity" was not known then. "Therefore, he was cleared for release." 
American military officials said tonight that they were "solely responsible for his erroneous release and are conducting a thorough investigation to ensure no further recurrences." A $25,000 reward was offered for information leading to his capture. 
Mr. Neifus lived in a compound near Hilla. On Wednesday, American soldiers and policemen went to the house and arrested two of his grandsons. Other relatives in the house said all the accusations against the family -- that it helped Mr. Hussein's henchmen kill men, women and children in 1991 -- were false. 
The complexity of postwar Iraq has led American forces into law enforcement tasks for which they are not well prepared. They are still searching for Mr. Hussein and his key officials. They are fighting hardened criminals freed from prison by an amnesty granted by Mr. Hussein late last year. 
For many Iraqis, the shifting role of American troops has been a shock. Just eight weeks ago, they were rolling across the country passing out candy to children. Now they are kicking in doors and blocking traffic to seize the weapons that most Iraqis have for home defense.
In Hit, the change of perception about the American presence is palpable. "Having the Americans standing in the streets really provokes the people," said Qusay Yusef, a carpenter with four children.
For now, the Americans have withdrawn. Captain Watson said that the patrols and roadblocks would continue, but that his troops would still be "at pains" not to appear as "ugly Americans."

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Taking Fire From Left as Well as Right 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29 

 BODY:
After years of being vilified by conservatives, Hillary Rodham Clinton is suddenly facing mounting criticism from an unlikely quarter: liberals.
 Core Democratic constituencies that helped Mrs. Clinton win her Senate seat in New York two and a half years ago are expressing deep disappointment in her, saying she has been unwilling to challenge President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress on issues of importance to them. 
 Those who have expressed disappointment in Mrs. Clinton include gay rights advocates, antiwar organizers and even advocates for children and the poor, a group with which she has been closely associated for decades. 
Political analysts and critics on the left say Mrs. Clinton appears to be modeling herself on her husband, Bill Clinton, who was also criticized for abandoning the Democratic Party's liberal base to win larger political appeal. In Mrs. Clinton's case, they say, she appears to be taking for granted her liberal allies, a strong source of support, in favor of cultivating a broader audience.
"Is she playing to a national audience?" asked Anne Erickson, the director of the Greater Upstate Law Project, a group that advocates for poor people in New York.
"As a Democrat with liberal leanings, I can personally say that it is pretty disappointing to watch her stances on issues," Ms. Erickson said. "We expected better from her."
Mrs. Clinton's aides say her decisions are not part of any calculated effort to win over a wider constituency outside New York. Rather, they say, they reflect positions she has held since her days as first lady, like advocating stiffer restrictions on welfare recipients.
"This view of Hillary Clinton as a dyed-in-the-wool leftist is a caricature," said Howard Wolfson, an adviser to Mrs. Clinton. "Anyone who is surprised about her views on welfare reform and the war was not paying attention during the campaign."
Mrs. Clinton was unavailable for comment. But her spokeswoman, Karen Dunn, indicated that the differences do not make her any less an ally of the left. "She is one of their strongest advocates, but that doesn't mean that there is always agreement on how to approach every single issue," Ms. Dunn said. 
The criticism from her longtime allies comes at a time when Mrs. Clinton has managed to maintain a relatively noncontroversial image in the Senate. To be sure, to her longtime critics she remains an icon of liberalism. She is often invoked in literature that conservatives use to rally their supporters.
But since arriving in the Senate in January 2001, Mrs. Clinton has been a far less polarizing figure than she was in the White House. This is in part because she has tried to avoid the mistakes she made during her White House years -- when, for example, she moved rapidly toward radical changes in the health-care system and spoke of a "vast right-wing conspiracy" out to destroy her husband's presidency.
Mrs. Clinton now seems to be going out of her way to convince Republicans that she is someone with whom they can work. Only a few weeks ago, for example, she teamed with a person who, at first glance, might seem an unlikely ally: Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina who, as a member of the House, was a leader in the effort to impeach her husband.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Graham -- who once said, "Bill Clinton probably did more for my career than I ever did" -- co-sponsored legislation that called for increasing benefits for National Guard and Reserve members.
But some longtime supporters are beginning to bristle over many of her positions and statements.
In one of the more recent clashes, Mrs. Clinton drew fire from gay activists over the way she responded to comments made by Senator Rick Santorum, a Republican, who compared homosexuality to incest, bigamy and other illegal types of sexual behavior.
Matt Foreman, the former executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda and now the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said Mrs. Clinton was slow to respond to Mr. Santorum's comments. And, he noted, she refused to join a chorus of Democrats -- including New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer -- who called on Mr. Santorum to step down from his leadership post in the Senate Republican caucus.
Mrs. Clinton's aides acknowledge that she was not quick to respond to Mr. Santorum's remarks. But when she did, they say, she offered a forceful condemnation. Responding to criticism that Mrs. Clinton should have gone further and called for his resignation, Ms. Dunn, her spokeswoman, said, "It is the responsibility of the Republican Party to choose how it wishes to be represented."
The disappointment among gay rights advocates only deepened after Mrs. Clinton refused to say publicly whether she plans to support the promotion of an Army general who commanded a base where a gay soldier was beaten to death.
Several gay rights groups, chiefly the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, have been calling on the Senate Armed Services Committee, where Mrs. Clinton holds a seat, to block the promotionof Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, who was commander of Fort Campbell, Ky., in 1999, when a soldier beat Pfc. Barry Winchell to death in his barracks.
The organizations contend that Private Winchell's slaying was a hate crime that reflected a larger climate of homophobia at the base. But Mrs. Clinton's advisers say she wants to review concerns raised by the family and gay rights advocates in an executive session that she has requested.
Beyond that, Mrs. Clinton refused to meet with Private Winchell's family when they came to Capitol Hill a few weeks back to discuss the matter with members of the Armed Services Committee, said Steve Ralls, a spokesman for the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. "The family is disappointed," he said.
Mr. Foreman went further. "We are an unbelievably loyal, generous and significant part of her base," he said. "But what we have been met with is a reluctance to stand up for us."
Her aides say that before meeting with the family, Mrs. Clinton, a new member of the committee, wanted to confer with its most senior members and gather more information from them. They say that having done that, Mrs. Clinton is now willing to meet with the family. 
Among her other critics are antiwar Democrats, who are angry that she did not challenge the case President Bush made for war in Iraq, even as other prominent Democrats did.
Mrs. Clinton has also angered advocates for the poor, whose ties to her go back decades to when she was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund.
The disagreement involves the president's proposal to increase the number of hours that welfare recipients must work in exchange for cash assistance and other benefits. Many advocates for the poor regard this as one of the biggest issues Congress will take up this year and have been lobbying Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats to oppose such requirements.
But Mrs. Clinton has joined a group of moderate and conservative Democratic senators in supporting a bill to increase the work requirement to 37 hours a week, a significant increase over the current 30 hours and only slightly less than the 40 hours Mr. Bush would require.
Mrs. Clinton's advisers say that no one should be surprised by her position, noting that she supported the bill her husband signed in 1996 overhauling the nation's welfare program, despite opposition from many of her liberal allies. In addition, they say, Mrs. Clinton has insisted that any additional work requirements be tied to billions of dollars in child-care financing.
Philip Friedman, a Democratic operative in New York, said that criticism over these positions was not likely to hurt Mrs. Clinton, who is not up for re-election until 2006. Mr. Friedman said the state's sizable liberal base would ultimately stand by her, just as liberals stood by her husband, despite their complicated relationship with him.
"It's not going to mean anything," he said. "Democrats love the Clintons, and that's why her husband was able to get away with going off the reservation now and then."

To the Editor:
 With Republicans seeking "an era of dominance" and Democrats in desperate need of money and a focus ("State of the Party" series, front page, May 25 and 26), American politics has hit a dangerous low. 
Though this could be seen as a normal swing to the right (as in the 1950's) that will be followed by a swing to the left (as in the 1960's), one fears the lasting consequences of the ascendant reactionary trend. 
 If we were not facing complex and vexing problems (including global climate change, terrorist plotting, economic stagnation and poorly financed social services), the zeal with which national Republicans are impoverishing our federal and state governments might be correctable.
But no swing back to the political center will allow us to correct mistakes that cause sea levels to rise, expose us to increasingly toxic attacks and leave so many children behind.

The Double-Edged Ax of American Technology

BYLINE:  By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
AMERICA AS SECOND CREATION
Technology and Narratives of New Beginnings
By David E. Nye
Illustrated. M.I.T. Press. 371 pages. $29.95.
 What was so special about the American ax? In 1828 James Fenimore Cooper said it was admirable "for form, for neatness and precision of weight." In 1841 the British Parliament, impressed by its power, investigated its design. When Lincoln ran for president in 1860, his supporters marched with enormous symbolic models. And by the turn of the 20th century, it was the tool of choice in tall tales about Paul Bunyan, logger extraordinaire. 
 But the truly unusual character of the American ax, this book makes clear, is that it was considered unusual at all. It was treated not as a tool of destruction but as an instrument of creation. Grasping its distinctively curved hickory handle, the solitary pioneer carved a home from the untamed woodlands. In the swings of the ax, Cooper wrote, have come conquests that "have left civilization in their train instead of havoc and desolation."
Or such, at any rate, is one version of the story. For as David E. Nye shows in "America as Second Creation," every narrative of how a great invention helped create an American Eden inspired a counternarrative of how that same invention helped construct an American hell. The same ax championed as the creator of the log cabin was soon enough condemned as despoiler of the natural world, leaving behind stumps and wrecking the habitats of American Indians. The "heroic story of self-sufficiency," Mr. Nye writes, eventually became a "tale of thoughtless land exploitation."
And as with ax, so too with the mill, the canal, the railroad and the dam. On one hand, these technologies were championed for transforming the wilderness into "a prosperous and egalitarian society." On the other, they have been condemned for having increased economic inequality and for running roughshod over those less powerful. On one hand, they have been invocations of optimism and progress; on the other, they have been reminders of disruption and marginality.
In his earlier books, Mr. Nye, professor of American studies at Odense University in Denmark, has been a remarkable chronicler of how technological change has impressed itself on the American character. In this book, Mr. Nye draws on 40 years of scholarship, beginning with Leo Marx's influential "The Machine in the Garden" (1965), with its study of how the railroad and the Industrial Revolution were seen as intrusions on a pastoral realm celebrated by American writers. Hawthorne, Emerson and their contemporaries reappear in Mr. Nye's book, with all their wariness. So do many of the tics of the contemporary academic discipline of American studies, which has itself been beset by precisely the same confrontations that Mr. Nye traces.
In fact, in outlining these warring narratives, Mr. Nye inadvertently provides a portrait of how Americans still think about themselves -- and also, perhaps, how others still look at them -- as bouncing between idealistic images and their extreme inversions.
Underlying the celebrations of American technology, Mr. Nye argues, is a vastly different experience. While European cities, for example, often developed around a central church with roads radiating outward, American cities often developed around a mill on a river and its expanding promise of commerce. While railroads developed in Europe and England to serve existing cities, in the United States railroads helped determine where cities would be developed.
And because there were no long traditions of land ownership or conquest, and because ownership often had to be assigned to land as yet unexplored, the rectangular grid became the defining order for the American landscape. Jefferson was a champion of the new grid system, which struck one French observer in 1836 as being more suited to the division of the heavens than of the earth. New towns were laid out on grids before they had inhabitants, and new grids extended across the continent with the railroad. One assumption, Mr. Nye points out, is that "the land was unused, empty and waiting for settlers." 
There was also, Mr. Nye argues, an assumption that resources were abundant, that forests were unbounded and that prairies were open to unlimited farming. While America was inventing this sense of possibility, European consciousness was elsewhere: Malthus, in 1798, saw wars as the consequences of population growth and limited resources.
Counternarratives, of course, rejected American optimism, portraying each technology not as liberator but as oppressor. The mill "created not prosperity but poverty," Mr. Nye writes. "Its town was not harmonious but divided."
The railroad "confronted Americans with new forms of political power, class conflict, accidents, land swindles, pollution and unfamiliar environmental problems."
Mr. Nye clearly prefers these critiques to celebrations, but the counternarrative surely deserves its own countering. Mr. Nye writes, for example, "The railroad did not open the West; it closed it to poor settlers." But of course despite land speculation, eventually the railroad did open the West to vast migrations of populations seeking economic opportunity, just as the mill did far more than create poverty and division. Mr. Nye sometimes seems to defer to a new orthodoxy.
And the pattern of utopian expectation and dystopian warnings is also familiar, repeating itself again and again as technologies have erupted in innovation. Something similar happened during the last decade with the Internet, which was both hailed for ushering in a new era of human consciousness and attacked for increasing economic inequalities and pollinating pornography. Both were exaggerations.
For all its intriguing analysis, then, the great wonder and great fear inspired by technology was better explored in one of Mr. Nye's earlier books, "American Technological Sublime." The immensity of transformation, the grandeur of possibility, the overwhelming dangers of failure, the grim worries over retribution: these are latent in the technological sublime. And they still haunt American life and debates about its future.

S.&P. Index Is Up for the Sixth Week in the Last Seven

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Shares rose yesterday, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed the week higher for the sixth time in seven weeks, after surveys on Midwest manufacturing and consumer confidence increased optimism that the economy is reviving.
 AOL Time Warner advanced after it said it would repay debt with the $750 million it gained in the settlement of a dispute with Microsoft. Home Depot, the No. 1 home-improvement retailer, rose on plans to repurchase up to $500 million of its shares and spend $4 billion on new stores and improvements. 
 The S.& P. 500 added 13.95 points, or 1.5 percent, to 963.59, an 11-month high. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 139.08 points, or 1.6 percent, to 8,850.26. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 20.96 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,595.91, its highest level since last May 31. 
"The economy is showing signs of rebounding and earnings will follow," said Peter Boockvar, market strategist at Miller Tabak. "You could see north of 9,000 in the Dow and 1,000 on the S.& P. 500 before we top out. People are buying the dips."
Stocks extended gains after the factory index of the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago rose to 52.2 in May from 47.6 in April. Readings above 50 indicate that business is improving. 
The survey suggests that the economy is gaining momentum after the Iraq war. Since March 11, the S.& P. 500 has rallied 20 percent and the Nasdaq has soared 26 percent.
The S.& P. 500 recorded its third straight month of gains, the longest streak since the fourth quarter of 2001. It added 5.1 percent in May. The Dow average rose 4.4 percent in May, and rounded off its fourth weekly advance in five. The Nasdaq jumped 9 percent this month, its fourth straight month of gains.
AOL Time Warner rose 37 cents, to $15.22. The company, with $26.3 billion of debt at the end of last quarter, had accused Microsoft of illegally dominating the Internet-browser software market and shutting out its Netscape Navigator program. Microsoft added 40 cents, to $24.80. Home Depot gained 93 cents, to $32.49. 
The University of Michigan's April consumer confidence index rose to 92.1 in May, its highest in a year. The index was at 86 in April.
A Commerce Department report showed personal spending slipped 0.1 percent in April, while personal income was flat. Molex had the biggest advance in the S.& P. 500, rising $2.57, or 10 percent, to $27.37. 
Nvidia, whose chips help run Microsoft's video game console, added $1.96, to $26.17. ImClone Systems continued its advance, rising $5.04, to $28.50. At a conference tomorrow, the company, which makes biopharmaceutical products, will present results of tests showing that its cancer drug Erbitux is effective, according to its partner, Merck of Germany, which is not related to Merck of the United States.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury markets eased yesterday, as the Chicago purchasing managers index for May gave a hint of a recovery in the Midwest manufacturing sector and equity values rose.
As the stock market advances, there is a sense that Treasuries must give ground -- especially with yields on the benchmark 10-year note close to the 45-year lows reached on May 22. The rally "seems to be attracting some asset shifts from bonds to stocks," said Sadakichi Robbins, head of global fixed-income trading at Bank Julius Baer.
The benchmark 10-year note fell 9/32 , to a price of 102 4/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.37 percent from 3.34 percent on Thursday. The 30-year bond fell 19/32 , to a price of 116. Its yield rose to 4.37 percent from 4.34 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Pay Debated at British Bank's Meeting

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 30 

 BODY:
Sir John Bond's message to British investors today was unapologetic: Executives are paid more in America. Get used to it.
 Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting of HSBC, the London-based global bank where he is chairman, Sir John defended the compensation package offered to William F. Aldinger, who became executive director of the bank's American operations this year. 
 "The heart of this issue is how and whether an international company, headquartered in London, can acquire a business in the U.S.A., where remuneration practices and scales are different," Sir John said.
Mr. Aldinger joined HSBC last November when the bank bought Household International, the consumer loan company based in Prospect Heights, Ill., for $14.2 billion.
As part of the deal, HSBC agreed to give Mr. Aldinger a new three-year contract as chief executive of Household and $20.3 million in severance for tearing up the old one. Counting that payment and the roughly $36 million he is to get under the new contract, Mr. Aldinger will be one of the highest-paid executives at any company based in Britain. 
HSBC shareholders used the meeting today to express their displeasure with Mr. Aldinger's pay, saying that "these American-style remuneration packages" had no place in Britain and that they exemplified the kind of corporate greed that had brought down Enron, Tyco and other companies.
"We don't want to see that happen in Britain, do we?" one shareholder asked.
Alan MacDougall, managing director of Pensions Investment Research Consultants, a London-based group that advises institutional shareholders, said at the meeting that if HSBC does not draw the line against such pay, other leading British companies could drift toward American-size compensation. 
"This is a structural debate," Sir John responded. "Our policy is to pay the going rate, wherever we operate." 
Executive pay packages at British companies have come under new scrutiny since the beginning of the year, when an amendment to the Corporate Governance Act gave shareholders the opportunity to vote on whether to approve them. The votes are not binding, but analysts said corporate boards would feel intense pressure to respect the results. 
Though Mr. Aldinger's contract drew the most criticism, it was not among the executive pay packages put to a vote at today's meeting. About 22 percent of shareholders voted against approving the pay of Sir Keith Whitson, the bank's chief executive, and other officers.
Shareholders did get to vote today on Mr. Aldinger's candidacy for a seat on HSBC's board; some 15 percent abstained or voted no.
Sir John credited Mr. Aldinger with helping bring Household "safely" to HSBC. Successful acquisitions overseas are especially important to the bank because there is probably no significant purchase it could make in Britain without running into antitrust problems, he said. Household will contribute 20 percent of HSBC's net income and make the bank one of the biggest credit card issuers in the world, he added. 
In general, Sir John told shareholders, the global economic picture for the year ahead is grim. "We continue to see the world economy characterized by weak growth, excess capacity and subdued revenues for corporates," he said.
Sir John said he foresaw continued erosion of employment in Europe and the United States as companies seek to cut costs by moving both manufacturing and service functions to low-wage countries, a trend that he said might make international friction, trade barriers and trade disputes "a more common part of the international scene."

HEADLINE: 2 Reports Give Hints of Strengthening Economy 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
United States consumer confidence rose this month to the highest point in a year, and manufacturing in the Chicago area expanded, signs the economy may be strengthening.
 The consumer sentiment index compiled by the University of Michigan increased to 92.1 in May, the highest since last June, from the April reading of 86. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said yesterday that its factory index rose to 52.2 from 47.6 in April. Readings above 50 indicate that business is improving. 
 The manufacturing statistics reflected increased orders and production. A sustained rise in consumer sentiment, along with lower energy costs and an increase in home refinancing, could help spur consumer purchases, giving the economy a lift.
"It's certainly an encouraging development," said Douglas Porter, a senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns. "The Chicago report shows that from a production side, this is nothing but good news, and it does look as if manufacturing is slowly but surely getting back into gear."
The Chicago report tracks earlier Federal Reserve surveys in the Philadelphia region and New York State that showed manufacturing improving this month.
Economists and investors watch the Midwest for clues about the direction of manufacturing. The Chicago area is home to more manufacturing jobs than any other metropolitan area in the United States.
In April, the economy had trouble gaining strength. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed personal spending fell in April by 0.1 percent, the second decrease in four months, while incomes were little changed. 
The University of Michigan said its consumer expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, rose to 91.4, the highest in a year, from 79.3 in the previous month.
The preliminary indication had been 92.7.
The current conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, declined to 93.2 this month from 96.4 in April and from a preliminary May reading of 94.1.
The United States economy grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Frugal Japanese Dig Into Savings 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 27 

 BODY:
In more prosperous times just a few years ago, Kiwako Kaiyama and Kiyoko Kitamura looked to a future of kicking back on their husbands' salaries. Instead, to make ends meet, the 40-something housewives have had to cut their spending, take part-time jobs and -- shockingly, for Japan -- dip into their savings.
 For decades, the Japanese routinely socked away 10 to 20 percent of their incomes, earning a reputation as one of the world's most frugal people. In those years, Japan badgered the United States about its wasteful ways and trade deficits, even as Japanese companies benefited from selling Americans cars and electronics. 
 But a decade of recession here and a rapidly aging society are changing all that. Japan's household savings rate fell to a postwar low of 6.9 percent in 2001, the last year for which complete figures are available, from 11 percent in 1999 and 14 percent in 1990. 
Based on preliminary data, the savings rate fell another two percentage points in 2002, economists said. Within a decade, if current trends persist, Japan's savings rate will hit 1.5 percent, according to HSBC Securities, pushing it below America's, which rose to 3.7 percent in 2002.
This reversal of fortune for the world's two largest economic powers could have far-reaching consequences. For Japan, already the most heavily indebted nation in the developed world, the declining savings pool could lead to higher interest rates, making it harder to finance the debt.
Japan also helps America finance its debt by purchasing United States Treasury bonds. As Japan's savings shrink, it will have less money to export, which might push up American interest rates as well.
While economists can offer numerous technical explanations for Japan's declining savings rate, the reasons are clear enough to Ms. Kaiyama, 47.
Sitting around a snug kitchen table with her 52-year-old husband, Naoyuki, and his elderly parents, she cataloged the economic uncertainties between sighs and sips of tea. Taxes are rising, wages are falling, health benefits are being slashed and, most worrisome of all, Mr. Kaiyama's job and pension at an electronics maker are no longer safe.
"Every day, I wonder whether my husband's company will go under," she said uneasily. "Money just seems to drain away."
Some of the erosion in Japan's savings rate was inevitable. In the postwar era, Japan benefited greatly from a young and expanding population, which helped to expand both growth and savings rates. Today, more Japanese are reaching retirement age and are dipping into their savings accounts to pay for everyday costs, a trend expected to continue.
By 2010, more than 22 percent of Japan's 127 million citizens will be at least 65 years old, up from 17 percent just three years ago. By 2015, the elderly will outnumber the young, because of a record low birthrate. With interest rates near zero and life insurance companies cutting payouts, pensioners are already having a harder time.
Working families, suffering from economic stagnation and deflation, are also saving less. That is what Mrs. Kitamura, who works part time in a bank, has been forced to do. The salary of her husband, a Tokyo city employee, has been cut, something previously unheard of. With home loan payments piling up and a third child in school, "our savings are down to zero," she said.
To cut corners, the Kitamuras have given up on eating out and pack lunch boxes to take to work. Like other Japanese, they are spending less on cars, homes and other big-ticket items. A higher percentage of income now goes to ordinary things like food, clothing and education.
"People are hanging on, not letting their hair down," Chris Walker, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo, said, referring to the declining savings rate. "If things continue as they are, Japan will subside toward a middle-income country."
Mr. Walker's pessimism stems from Japan's national debt, which is 150 percent of gross national product, highest among the major industrialized nations. Though the government can issue bonds indefinitely, sooner or later it has to pay them back. Assuming the economy grows at 1.5 percent a year over the next decade, as the government expects, lawmakers will have to raise taxes, commandeering even more of the country's savings.
That process is already under way. In April, the government raised the portion of medical costs salaried workers have to pay, to 30 percent from 20 percent. On a recent visit to have his ears checked, Mr. Kaiyama discovered that the cost of his medicine had increased by 50 percent. Worse, the government's new tax formulas will substantially reduce Mr. Kaiyama's annual bonus -- worth five months' pay to the typical Japanese workers.
Together, the measures will extract 2.5 trillion yen, $21 billion, from consumers' pockets.
"With these extra increases, the burden on me just gets heavier," Mr. Kaiyama said.
The possibility of more tax increases, which the government is discussing, has led the Kaiyamas to buckle down. Every morning, Ms. Kaiyama scans the newspapers in search of bargains, riding 15 minutes out of her way by bicycle to track down cheaper vegetables.
Vacations, never extravagant, are now limited to sleepovers at a resort near Mount Fuji owned by her husband's company. To help pay for her two daughters' education, she works four days a week at a local grocery.
"I cannot put the burden only on my husband," she said.
Mr. Kaiyama, a personnel manager, is among the legions of "salarymen" who are being pushed to retire early so companies can trim their bloated payrolls. In Japan's seniority-based system, he cannot hope to get a new job that pays as much. So he hangs on, hoping to reach the mandatory retirement age of 60.
The government's prescription for its woes is higher taxes. To keep the health care system afloat, lawmakers are considering forcing those aged 75 and older to pay for 10 percent of their medical costs, while those from 65 to 74 would pay 20 percent.
Others favor a different approach. Keidanren, Japan's largest business lobby, wants to more than triple the national sales tax, to 18 percent, over the next dozen years. This way, it reasons, the entire nation can share the burden of paying for the elderly, not just working families.
The trouble is that a tax on nearly every transaction in the economy could set off another recession, like in 1997, when the consumption tax was raised to 5 percent from 3 percent. This would force consumers to use even more of their savings to make ends meet, economists said, increasing their uneasiness.
While Americans have been known to take to the streets or vote their representatives out of office, Japanese are more resigned about their plight. Openly discussing personal woes is less common in Japan, and with the Liberal Democrats in power for almost five decades, many voters have given up going to the polls.
"I can't trust the politicians to solve these problems," Ms. Kitamura said.
So she and her family, like the Kaiyamas, are learning to adjust their expectations. No grand trips to Hawaii or fancy dinners on the town. No guarantees that their husbands' jobs will be enough toretire on. Most of all, no big savings account to fall back on if times get tougher.

HEADLINE: Money Flows to Bonds, Despite Red Flags 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
What is wrong with this picture?
 The dollar is dropping in value, federal budget deficits are growing, the stock market is rising and the economy may be healthier than previously thought. And yet, long-term interest rates are still hovering near 40-year lows. 
 In the past, all other things being equal, a similar situation might have meant higher, not lower, long-term rates. 
In the view of several market experts, the Federal Reserve has convinced investors that it will not raise short-term interest rates anytime soon, and may even try to lower long-term rates. They say the Fed's actions -- as well as the statements of its chairman, Alan Greenspan -- have either influenced or temporarily overwhelmed the other, historically important factors.
"There are lots of things going on, and you have to sort out cause and effect," said Mark Gertler, the chairman of the economics department at New York University. He added that the current unusual state of affairs might melt away once the effects of the Fed's actions take hold.
For the moment, however, an increase in long-term rates seems far away. As a result, consumers may be able to pay less interest on mortgages and credit cards, and businesses may find it cheaper to invest in new construction or equipment. A further decrease in long-term rates, which the Fed could achieve by buying Treasury bonds with longer maturities, could give a bigger jolt to the economy and put an end to worries about deflation.
Anticipating such a move by the Fed, some investors have been buying long-term bonds, said Robert E. Mellman, a senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan Chase. They may be playing a precarious game of chicken, however. If the Fed's policy succeeds in generating growth and inflation, it will render the returns on the bonds less valuable.
"If the Fed's really trying to push inflation up, maybe you don't want to bet against them," Mr. Mellman said. "But that's not the way the market's taking it."
The window of opportunity for investors may be brief, but that has not stopped them from pouring money into longer-term securities. For some, that decision may have been overdue.
In the last several months, many institutional investors have been hoarding cash thanks to uncertainty about the economy and the Fed's plan of action, said Joseph W. Jasper, the director of fixed-income strategy at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. But now, with the Fed's apparent commitment to keeping short-term rates low, long-term bonds may be too tempting to pass up.
"They just can't stay short anymore," Mr. Jasper said. "It's too painful. The cost of staying in cash is too great."
In addition, investors tastes' may still be shifting from stocks to bonds. "People have, first of all, kind of recalibrated their expectation about risk," said John A. Penicook Jr., managing director and global head of fixed income for UBS Global Asset Management. "As they've moved away from equities, all these other things by definition have become relatively more attractive."
As well as providing a haven relative to stocks, Treasury bonds may be acting as a safety net relative to the rest of the world.
"The problem is if you're an investor, you just don't know where to put your money other than the U.S.," said Mr. Mellman at J. P. Morgan. "No one can find good places to invest."
Another possible explanation for falling long-term rates is an increase in the amount of money available for investment -- in other words, an increase in saving. Indeed, Mr. Penicook noted, recent statistics have shown an upturn in saving by American households. But it seems more likely that the two shifts -- from short- to long-term securities and from stocks to bonds -- are having more effect on the markets.
For one thing, Mr. Mellman said, an incremental change in saving by Americans could mean relatively little in the fast-moving global capital market. Moreover, their frugality may just be canceling the federal government's exploding deficits. "If you looked at saving rates for the overall U.S.," he said, "I don't think there can be an argument that they're going up."
Mr. Jasper at U.S. Bancorp suggested that a snowballing effect might also be helping to drive down interest rates on medium- to long-term bonds. As yields on Treasury securities fall, he said, mortgage rates tend to fall as well. Lower rates lead to refinancing, which often involves replacing partly paid 30-year loans with 15-year loans.
When refinancing becomes more popular, Mr. Jasper said, money managers who hold bundles of mortgages can see the maturities of their portfolios becoming shorter. Many 30-year mortgages are paid off within 10 years or less, and mortgages with 15-year terms typically last even less time before repayment.
The managers often want to offset this change with longer-duration securities, Mr. Jasper explained. So they buy 10-year Treasury notes, which the government is unlikely to pay off before a decade is up, driving down yields on those notes even further. "Whenever you get a rally in the 10-year, mortgage hedging activity will exaggerate that," Mr. Jasper concluded.
Setting off another refinancing boom, which could result in tens of billions of dollars in economic activity, may have been an explicit goal of the Fed. In the past, Mr. Greenspan has often cited the housing market as a main source of strength in the economy. He has also dismissed the notion of a bubble in the housing market, saying that such phenomena are more likely to occur in isolated localities rather than on a national level.
If the economy manages to avoid more shocks, like the war in Iraq and the torrent of corporate scandals, the underlying strength that Mr. Greenspan cites like a mantra might finally show through. Then those low long-term rates might disappear.
"The most likely strategy of the Fed is to commit to a policy of low short-term rates until there are signs of the economy strengthening and inflation picking up," Professor Gertler said. "Once there's evidence that's the economy's going to pick up, you'll likely see that long-term rates are going to rise."
He added that the supply of long-term bonds would increase, driving down their prices, as new tax cuts and higher spending burdened the federal government with more debt. "Ultimately, the recovery and the effect of the debt will put upward pressure on long-term rates."
The low rates might stick around longer, though, if prices rise slowly even after the economy improves its performance. "It's a perception that inflation's going to stay very low for a long time, and that's going to keep the Fed on hold for a long time," Mr. Mellman said. "It's sort of like faster growth with pretty low inflation."

HEADLINE: SARS Ebbs in East Asia, but Financial Recovery Is Slow 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 30 

 BODY:
While SARS infections have ebbed across East Asia, the economic consequences will continue to be felt for months to come, according to business executives and economists.
 Tourism is proving very slow to recover across the region. Retail sales have only begun to rebound, leaving stores reluctant to order more from factories because they are still stuck with huge inventories of goods that went unsold at the height of fears over SARS. 
 The effects of the continued sluggishness are being felt well beyond Hong Kong. Electronics manufacturers complain that the development of new consumer products has been badly delayed because engineers were barred from traveling among the United States, Taiwan and China after the SARS outbreak. That means stores around the world will have fewer innovative computer printers, scanners and wireless network devices on the shelves this Christmas, said Frank Huang, the chairman of the Taipei Computer Association. 
"There will be, because of SARS, a reduced number of products on the market, that is sure," during the crucial Christmas selling season, said Mr. Huang, who is also the chairman of Power Chip, one of Taiwan's largest manufacturers of computer chips.
Yet some encouraging signs remain for Asian economies. Exports are still strong, especially from China and especially to Europe, as the rising euro has improved the competitiveness of Asian goods. Most Asian currencies are formally or informally pegged to the sinking American dollar, making Asian products less expensive in Asian markets.
And the number of new cases of SARS is down sharply from the levels of two months ago. China and Taiwan each reported seven new cases of SARS today, while Hong Kong had four new cases.
The strong divergence between slow domestic demand and brisk exports has made it especially difficult for economists to gauge economic output. Sometimes misleading statistics from image-conscious governments have made matters worse.
China's government-controlled media, for example, recently said that economic output in China was 8.9 percent higher in April than a year earlier. But investment bank economists say that this figure just shows that the Chinese economy expanded quite fast in the third and fourth quarters of last year and the first quarter of this year.
Comparing economic output in the second quarter of this year with output in the first quarter, estimates range from Morgan Stanley's prediction of zero growth to J. P. Morgan's assessment of minus 2 percent. Most economists expect growth in China to resume in the third quarter, but not until the fourth quarter is the Chinese economy expected to resume the 7 to 10 percent growth that it enjoyed until this spring.
Hong Kong's government today cut in half its estimate of economic growth this year, to 1.5 percent, with much of that growth having occurred in January, February and early March, before the SARS outbreak crippled demand. The International Monetary Fund was somewhat more optimistic today, predicting that the economy here would grow by 2.2 percent this year.
"The economy was actually doing very well until we hit SARS," said Antony Leung, Hong Kong's financial secretary. Even before SARS, however, Hong Kong was suffering from severe deflation, and Mr. Leung predicted today that because of SARS, the general price level here will drop 2.5 percent this year, instead of the 1.5 percent previously forecast by the government.
Economies have also suffered in other countries with large SARS outbreaks, according to assessments released this week. The Council of Economic Planning and Development in Taiwan reported steep declines in many industries this week, while Morgan Stanley warned that Singapore appeared to be headed into another recession.
Andy Xie, a Morgan Stanley economist, said that companies ranging from sausage makers to paper manufacturers had been complaining to him that stores in China had stopped ordering because of bulging inventories of unsold goods.
At Lee Fung China Ware, a large store in downtown Hong Kong selling porcelain vases and bone china plates in many hues, sales are deeply depressed, said Lily Wong, a sales representative. Foreign tourists used to account for a third of sales, yet not one has come to the store since March.
Sales to local residents leaped on May 23 in the euphoria that erupted when the World Health Organization lifted its advisory against travel here, Ms. Wong said. But these transactions plunged again a day later and remain 40 percent below their pre-SARS levels. The store has told its supplier, a factory in southern China, to halt shipments.
Multinationals' long-term enthusiasm for investing in China, from building factories to setting up new sales networks, appears to have survived the SARS outbreak this spring. But company officials warn of delays in negotiating deals and performing due-diligence inspections in China.
A few businesses are still entering the market. Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe, a San Francisco-based law firm with 660 lawyers, has just hired 19 lawyers from a law firm here to expand its Hong Kong practice.
Paul Laudicina, a vice president of A. T. Kearney, a consulting firm, said that initial results from the firm's annual survey of multinational corporations did not suggest any long-term flagging in foreign investment. "I don't detect yet any wholesale change in investor orientation toward China and the region," he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
With Wireless, English City Reaches Across Digital Divide

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, England, May 29 

 BODY:
Three years ago, Shirley Hughes lived a life of dreary routine, collecting welfare checks, bringing up two children as a single mother, passing her evenings in front of the television.
 Today, she teaches her neighbors how to use computers at a local college while studying for a teaching certificate. At home, she skips "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in favor of the Internet, which she surfs avidly, downloading patterns for patchwork quilts, her favorite hobby. 
 Ms. Hughes's computer is connected to the Internet "24/7," as she puts it, through a technology known as Wi-Fi. For her, it has been a virtual passport out of the decaying industrial landscape of East Manchester, a place only now recovering from the end of history's last great commercial revolution. 
Wi-Fi, or wireless fidelity, has generated a lot of excitement here and in the United States as a way to offer high-speed Internet access in airports, cafes, bars and restaurants -- anywhere one finds a surfeit of laptop-toting customers and a scarcity of telephone jacks.
In Manchester, the once-grimy Victorian city famous as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, Wi-Fi is being used, for the first time ever on this scale, as a way to bridge the digital divide.
"We wanted to give people access to the latest technology," said Sean McGonigle, a local official who led the effort to build a network in Manchester. "In our wildest dreams, we didn't envisage the impact it would have."
Ms. Hughes, 40, marvels at the changes in her life. "If not for this, I'd still be cleaning house," she said.
Unlike the latest third-generation, or 3G, cellular telephone technology, where European providers are ahead of their American counterparts, Europe trails the United States in the development of Wi-Fi. But there have been a raft of projects begun here in recent weeks, suggesting that Europe has caught the bug.
The International Data Corporation, a research firm, predicts that Europe will have 32,500 hubs, or "hot spots," by 2007, up from 1,083 sites at the end of 2002. They will generate a projected $1.4 billion in revenue.
For example, Paris is starting to construct a wireless network, using the Metro system, with its 400 stations, as a backbone. At the moment, Wi-Fi coverage is limited to a single bus route that connects two Paris train stations, the Gare du Nord and Porte d'Orleans.
Eventually, the Paris public transportation authority plans to install up to 10 radio antennas in every major Metro station, allowing riders to send e-mail or browse the Web while commuting to and from work.
Here in Manchester, by using radio transmitters and other wireless equipment supplied by Cisco Systems, the city has turned a six-square-mile area into a Wi-Fi hot spot. Residents can receive high-speed Internet access by mounting a small antenna on their homes and inserting a card into their PC's.
The network covers 4,500 houses, in a motley neighborhood that ranges from tidy terraced homes to bleak housing projects. About 730 homes have signed up for the service so far. Mr. McGonigle hopes to connect 1,500 homes by the end of the year, and 2,500 by the middle of 2004.
For $:16, or $26.50 a month, people can have unlimited Internet access. A cheaper package, for $:6, or $10, a month, gives access to a Web site called EastServe, which offers e-mail, online chat groups, and news and information tailored to East Manchester.
Comparable service by a telephone or cable company would cost $30 to $40 a month. And it would depend on whether these providers were willing or able to offer broadband access.
Cable operators have wired less than 10 percent of East Manchester because it remains an unappealing market. The BT Group, formerly British Telecommunications, can offer broadband access by upgrading its existing copper wires. The trouble is, a quarter of the residents here do not have phone service, either because they have been disconnected or rely exclusively on cellphones.
"We found that the gap between affluent and deprived areas has gotten wider with technology," Mr. McGonigle said.
Before this project, Wi-Fi was viewed less as a technology leveler than as a convenience for sophisticated techies. In its most visible incarnation -- in airports, cafes, and the like -- it offers business travelers and other switched-on types superfast Web access on the road.
Offices and factories also use Wi-Fi technology to create private communications networks. With new phones from Cisco and Motorola, people are even using it to make cellular calls.
At first, industry executives said, mobile phone providers in Europe viewed Wi-Fi as a threat to 3G, a more advanced technology in which they have invested billions of dollars for licenses. But as 3G has been delayed by financial and technical hurdles, some providers now view Wi-Fi as a potential stopgap technology, until 3G is ready.
"Now that they see it's going to happen anyway, they want to be involved," said George Polk, a Wi-Fi entrepreneur in London.
Mr. Polk's company, Cloud, announced last month that it would turn 200 pubs into hot spots. It is the first phase of a plan to build a nationwide network, with 3,000 pubs and other public places.
Cloud will act as a wholesaler, selling access on the network to providers like BT Open Zone, a wireless subsidiary of the BT Group. Open Zone, in turn, will sell service, at a monthly subscription or hourly rates, to customers whose laptops are equipped with the necessary software.
Whether an English pub, with its jukebox and dartboards, is a suitable place for catching up on e-mail or surfing the Net is a debatable point. Mr. Polk insisted that pubs had become far more than watering holes in British society.
"It is the coffee shop of England," he said, evoking images of people pecking at their laptops while sipping a pint.
In Manchester, a local company, Netario Wireless, has installed hot spots in two of the city's most striking contemporary buildings: Bridgewater Hall, a performing arts center, and the Urbis museum, a sloping glass-encased structure with interactive exhibits on the world's great cities.
Philip T. Coen, Netario's enthusiastic chief executive, said he planned to build a Wi-Fi network so pervasive that it would transform central Manchester from a patchwork of hot spots into a "hot zone."
"If you can make deals with the right landowners," Mr. Coen said, pointing to the roofs of strategically situated buildings, "you can Wi-Fi a whole city, and there's nothing anybody can do about it."
Mr. Coen's approach may sound sly, but it merely reflects the technical realities of Wi-Fi. Because the radio signal carries in a radius of only about 100 to 150 feet, Wi-Fi providers typically cut deals with the proprietors of bars and cafes to install their equipment in each establishment.
By mounting antennas on the roofs of buildings across the street from popular meeting places, Mr. Coen hopes to be able to offer service without having to hustle for every bar owner or restaurateur.
"The urban solution is far more demanding," said Alan Salisbury, a consultant at Gaia Technologies, a Welsh company that designed the network in East Manchester. "We feel it's more suitable for rural areas."
Among Gaia's other projects are a network connecting three rural villages in Cumbria, in northwestern England, and a system that offers Internet access and e-mail to 300 schools in Wales.
Cisco is supplying equipment to a Wi-Fi project in Somiedo, a Spanish village so isolated that it gets its primary Internet connection via satellite. It is then beamed across the town by Wi-Fi antennas.
East Manchester did not face that hurdle. The challenge here was figuring out how to surmount a jagged landscape that mixes two- and three-story brick houses, towering trees and vast empty spaces where 19th-century steel mills and housing once stood.
The project's manager, Bob Jonas, mounted a small forest of antennas on top of four apartment towers on each corner of East Manchester. Two of the four receive the Internet through fiber optic wire.
From there, a radio signal is beamed to schools and Internet cafes, as well as to other rooftop antennas, which act as distribution points, relaying the signal to individual houses. Though homes do not have to be in direct line of sight of an antenna to receive the signal, an unobstructed path is helpful.
"It's very difficult to get a strong enough radio signal," said Mr. Jonas, who is trained as a radio engineer.
Signing up enough subscribers to make the network sustainable is an even greater challenge. Manchester subsidized the sale of 3,500 computers to residents, the vast majority of whom have never owned one.
But the service rollout has not been as rapid as Mr. Jonas would have liked, partly because of technical problems. Though the network has cost $2.4 million -- a paltry sum by industry standards -- Mr. Jonas knows that the pot of public money in Manchester is not bottomless.
What gives him confidence is the palpable social effect the Internet has had on the economically downtrodden people of East Manchester. The chat groups on the EastServe Web site crackle with debates, ranging from whether Britain should adopt the euro to the proposed design of a statue that will stand in front of the new Manchester soccer stadium. 
Irene Johnson, a lifelong resident, said East Manchester languished through three grim decades after the steel and cotton mills shut down. "Everyone I knew signed up for the dole," she said. "It was degrading."
Now, she said, a sense of community has been reborn. "You hear kids in the schoolyard talking about what they saw on the Internet," Mrs. Johnson said. "I would never have imagined it."

HEADLINE: Pataki Asks Board to Reconsider Rejection of Jobless Benefits for a Same-Sex Partner 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
When Jeanne Newland's companion landed a prestigious computer job in Virginia, Ms. Newland did not hesitate to quit her own job in Rochester and make the move south.
 After applying for 150 jobs in Virginia with no success, Ms. Newland applied for unemployment insurance back in New York, hoping to benefit from an unusual wrinkle in New York State law. While workers usually receive jobless benefits only when they are laid off, workers who voluntarily quit their jobs to follow a spouse who has obtained a job out of state can still qualify for benefits. 
 But when Ms. Newland applied for unemployment insurance, her application was rejected. State Labor Department officials informed her that she did not qualify because she and her domestic partner, Natasha Doty, were not married.
"This isn't fair," Ms. Newland said this week, "because I'm not even legally allowed to be married to my partner, so I'm excluded right at the outset. As far as we're concerned, we're as married as we could be." 
Ms. Newland's appeal of the decision was rejected, first by an administrative law judge and then by the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board. But in an unusual move, Gov. George E. Pataki has asked the board to reconsider its decision. 
Mr. Pataki's intervention, announced yesterday by a Labor Department spokesman, came after several gay advocacy groups, led by Empire State Pride Agenda, urged him to step in. But lawyers involved in the case acknowledged that the appeals board might face some difficulties in reversing itself and ruling for Ms. Newland, because that might open the door for any person, even one in a relatively brief relationship, to qualify for jobless benefits after quitting a job and following a partner out of state. 
State law says that people who quit jobs voluntarily can qualify for jobless benefits only if they quit for "good cause." In the past, the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board ruled that quitting a job and following a partner out of state was good cause so long as the claimant was married. 
Ms. Newland and Ms. Doty have been together for six years. They met in Los Angeles, where Ms. Newland was a police officer, and they moved together to Rochester. There, Ms. Newland worked in technical support for Element K, an educational software company, while Ms. Doty was a printing test manager for Xerox. 
Ms. Doty landed a higher-paying job in Richmond, Va., as an information technology manager at Capital One, a financial services company, and Ms. Newland moved there with her in December 2000. They own a house together, share living expenses and have joint bank and investment accounts.
Romana Mancini, Ms. Newland's lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said yesterday: "Jeanne and Natasha have done everything they can to demonstrate their commitment to one another and to solidify their relationship. Their relationship deserves just as much protection and recognition as that of a married couple."
Ms. Newland has filed a lawsuit against the state seeking to overturn the appeal court's decision. But lawyers involved in the case said they expected it to be suspended pending the appeal board's reconsideration of the case.
Ms. Newland and Ms. Mancini applauded the governor's intervention. "It's a good sign, but it doesn't mean we won yet," Ms. Mancini said. 
In another unusual twist, Ms. Newland's former employer, Element K, filed a legal brief on her behalf. Employers often oppose applications for unemployment insurance because their unemployment insurance taxes increase with the number of former workers receiving jobless benefits. 
"The Rochester community is pretty open about this kind of thing," said Lance D'Amico, Element K's general counsel. "We have some senior-level people here who are openly gay. We thought it was important to support employees and people who have left."
Even though Ms. Newland landed a job as a fraud investigator with a bank last year, she decided against dropping her unemployment insurance case. 
"It's not about the money now," she said. "I'm not the first person this has happened to and I know I won't be the last. It would be nice if the decision against me was overturned so these benefits could be available to other people in my situation."

Pierre Lewandoski lay still as Evian mineral water, heated to 95 degrees, bubbled and swirled, gently massaging his middle-aged body.
 Dressed in a small, fitted swimsuit in shades of ocean blue, Mr. Lewandoski, a car mechanic from Arras in northern France, seemed eager to explain what he was doing in a bathtub on the banks of Lake Geneva 500 miles from home. 
 "I'm here on doctor's orders, for rheumatism in my neck," he said, insisting that the visitor to his small treatment room examine the official papers describing his intense physical therapy program. "I have no idea if this is going to work. But the government social security is paying 65 percent, and my boss gave me permission, so I decided to do it." 
A state-subsidized spa cure at Evian, which plays host this weekend to the economic summit meeting of the world's eight major industrialized nations, is just the kind of thing the forum is supposed to eliminate.
After all, a main purpose of these meetings is to promote global economic growth. But one of the major obstacles to such growth is the generous government spending on benefits that is common throughout much of Europe but that might be considered a luxury elsewhere.
The Evian spa and health club overlooking the lake is not ashamed of what it does at taxpayer expense. On the contrary, its brochure boasts that there are 18-day "thermal cures" to treat ailments like urinary infections, irritable colons, arterial hypertension, gout, postfracture traumas and tendinitis. The brochure comes with an insurance form to be filled out by a doctor. 
The lore and lure of Evian's water is not limited to the spa. This Alpine haven of 7,500 people on Lake Geneva is essentially a company town. Half of its workers earn their living in connection with a factory in nearby Publier that bottles more than 1.5 million gallons of Evian water a day for consumption in 150 countries.
Danone, the French food giant that owns Evian, also owns the 41-acre hotel complex where the meeting will take place. Evian is the official water of the meeting, although Badoit, the slightly fizzy water also owned by Danone, will also be available.
Given the economic stakes, it comes as no surprise that people here believe in the magic and mystique of the water. In the United States, a bottle of Evian -- with its distinctive pink and white label, red lettering and blue-topped mountains -- carries a certain cachet. In Evian itself, the water is ubiquitous.
At the Evian spa, clients can swim in an exercise pool filled with Evian (lightly chlorinated) and take a 12-jet shower with hot and cold Evian. The spa sells watches, baby bottles, diaper bags, T-shirts, beach towels, bathrobes, backpacks and baseball caps with the Evian label.
According to Gabriel Baum, the company spokesman, people in Evian brush their teeth, wash their vegetables, cook their pasta and make their coffee with the stuff.
The actress Kim Basinger was ridiculed a decade ago when she was rumored to wash her hair in Evian, prompting her to tell a television interviewer: "I've never in my life washed my hair in Evian water. I mean, I don't know how you would do that unless you lugged all those bottles into your bathroom."
But here, a rinse of Evian is considered a practical way to get out the last bit of soap from one's hair.
"My wife always uses Evian water as the final rinse of her hair," Mr. Baum said. "Absolutely. And it's good for the skin. Every day after my shave I splash Evian on my skin."
Mr. Baum added that despite the French-bashing in the United States following France's decision to oppose the American-led war against Iraq, Evian remains the official bottled water of the United States Army.
Every year, 30,000 visitors tour the Evian factory, where the water is bottled in a production line that never stops. Plastic bottles are produced on site. The final product is shipped on Evian trucks or on special Evian railroad cars and tracks.
Photography is banned to prevent outsiders from stealing secrets of the production and bottling processes.
But visitors can view a film on the history of the water informing them that Evian water takes more than 15 years to flow from the main mountain spring high in the Alps to the main town below.
In 1926, the French government declared that the source of the spring was in the "public interest." It protected the purity of the water source by creating a nature preserve 12 miles in diameter around it.
So in the center of town stands a small pavilion partly hidden under a balcony where a red marble fountain with a brass spigot spews Evian at a constant temperature of 53 degrees. It is a free service for the public required by law, part of serving the public interest. The fountain honors the Marquis de Lessert, an 18th-century nobleman said to have been cured of kidney stones after he drank Evian water.
Despite its dominance, Evian still has a bit of good-will work to do at home. The uniforms for the local soccer team advertise the Hotel de France, a two-star hotel on the main shopping street. The hotel owner pays for the shirts himself. In addition, the players do not even drink Evian, but rather Thonon, the still water from the Alpine spring of Thonon-les-Bains, the spa town next door.
So what's the fashionable drink in Evian? Evidently not Evian, even though it is said to be the best-selling mineral water in the world.
"If you want to be considered a snob," Mr. Drzewiecki said, "you drink Schweppes tonic."

HEADLINE: Despite Casino Tax Issue, Warm Greetings for McGreevey 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, May 30 

 BODY:
Out on the Boardwalk and inside Bally's casino, Gov. James E. McGreevey received a warm welcome today during his brief stop here for a political convention. Over the airwaves, however, the governor was met by a far harsher greeting -- a series of radio advertisements denouncing him and his plan to raise taxes on casinos. 
 Faced with a projected shortfall of $5 billion in this year's budget, Mr. McGreevey officially proposed in February to raise $135 million by increasing the tax on casino profits to 10 percent from 8 percent and by taxing the complimentary rooms and gifts that casinos lavish on high rollers. 
 New Jersey's casino industry, which is so politically potent that no governor has dared increase its tax rates in 25 years, struck back quickly and decisively, threatening to lay off workers and cancel construction projects in Atlantic City.
Despite opposition to the plan in the State Legislature, the McGreevey Administration nonetheless stood by its proposal, and this month, the casino industry began airing radio ads that portrayed the tax plan as an assault on all of economically distressed South Jersey.
So as Mr. McGreevey came to town today, an assortment of South Jersey and Philadelphia radio stations ran advertisements warning him: "Tax the casinos and you'll have a mess on your hands."
With the issue tied to the budget negotiations that will intensify between now and June 30, casino employees had quietly discussed the possibility of protesting outside during the governor's appearance. But when he spoke to the Democratic State Committee's annual convention today, and strolled on the boardwalk, Mr. McGreevey was met with smiles and handshakes. When he stopped in a coffee bar, one man even asked him to autograph a paper cup.
State Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican from Atlantic County, said that Mr. McGreevey's respectful reception should not be mistaken for any slackening of opposition to the tax proposal.
"People are going to be courteous to the governor, but everybody knows how people feel about this," said Mr. Gormley, one of the casino industry's most ardent defenders in the Legislature. "Like he's destroying the economy of the entire area."
Mr. McGreevey made no direct mention of the issue in his speech at the convention this afternoon, although his statement that all corporations must pay their fair share of the tax burden was similar to language he has used to argue that New Jersey casinos pay far less in taxes than gambling establishments in other states.
But later in the day, there were indications that behind-the-scenes negotiations were under way: The casino association agreed to stop broadcasting its ads for 72 hours, and the governor's office agreed to meet with representatives of the industry on Monday.
Casino officials have proposed several alternative plans that would generate revenue for the state without cutting into their profits: increasing parking fees to $3 a day from $2 and instituting a new state tax on leased slot machines. But those initiatives would raise less than half of the $135 million Mr. McGreevey had sought.
The Governor's spokesman, Micah Rasmussen, declined to discuss details of any negotiations, but said that Mr. McGreevey had enjoyed his visit to Atlantic City.

PERSON: Rev. Yukio Saito 

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
Japanese Pastor Reaches Out With Suicide Line

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
FOR the Rev. Yukio Saito, reflecting on the suicide hot line he opened in Japan 30 years ago inevitably raises mixed feelings.
 There is a satisfaction in knowing that many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have been saved by his initiative, Lifeline. It has expanded since 1971 from a single telephone bank staffed in the cramped recesses of a Tokyo church to a network of 50 call-in centers all around Japan, most operating 24 hours a day, employing more than 7,000 volunteer counselors. 
 But even labors on such a scale, he acknowledges wryly, seem to have had little effect on the silent avalanche of desperate people in this society driven to take their own lives. Long one of the world's highest, the reported suicide rate in Japan has increased 50 percent in just the last five years, reaching an annual toll of 30,000 deaths. 
"Looking back, it is rather interesting -- no, depressing -- to note that by today's standards the problem was relatively small when we started out," said Mr. Saito, 67, who wears sober gray suits that match his thinning hair. 
He came to work in suicide prevention through a friendship with a German woman who sheltered Japanese prostitutes in the 1970's. In the era of Japan's most robust economic growth, the cost of rapid industrialization was the breakdown of the traditional extended family and the transformation of cities like Tokyo into what was known, even then, as emotional deserts.
Fast-rising suicide rates had persuaded Mr. Saito to travel to the United States for training at a seminary in suicide counseling, and bring to Japan what would prove to be a groundbreaking vocation in a country where the shame and stigma surrounding suicide had enforced a deafening silence around the issue.
When he returned after a year away, an early experience working on his hot line convinced him that he had found his calling.
"A woman called and said she had just swallowed a large number of pills," he said in his scarcely modulated baritone. "Ordinarily we don't do this, but my assistant said we would come and get her. We drove to the place where she had fallen and got her to the hospital, where she had her stomach pumped.
"Her parents and friends had simply told her to be firm in her will to live, which only made things worse for her. Later, she told me that what had changed her mind about life was the concern showed to her by others." 
Since then, he has devoted his life to persuading the isolated and despondent to spare themselves. After more than three decades, Mr. Saito, retired from regular preaching, admits to few other interests.
But it is a calling that has often placed the Methodist minister at odds even with fellow believers in Japan's small Christian population, and that has fed feelings of estrangement from a mostly Shinto and Buddhist society. These religions, particularly Shinto, are more permissive of suicide. 
AFTER initial inroads when it was brought here by Spanish and Portuguese missionaries in the 16th century, Christianity has failed to spread, even as Japan has adopted other Western influences, from mass production to baseball, more eagerly than any other country in Asia.
For this reason, Mr. Saito has been attacked even within his own parish for not making a pitch to convert anguished callers to the hot line. But he does not compromise on that principle. "In order to appeal to everyone, we must not preach Christianity on the phone," he said. "When we receive calls from desperate people, our job is to understand these people, and to accept their feelings," he added, describing a method far more akin to psychoanalysis than to religious salvation. 
"Although I am a pastor, I became convinced a long time ago that saving lives was the most important work I could do," hesaid.
For all of his reluctance to preach to the anguished, Mr. Saito acknowledges that his Christianity led him into his work. As he tells the story, his own conversion had a mysterious, almost preordained quality.
Like many young Japanese, he felt unmoored and angst-ridden as a teenager amid the devastation of the years immediately following World War II. His family had a longtime ties to Shinto, Japan's ancient syncretic faith. Indeed, the grandfather who raised him after his father died at an early age was a Shinto priest.
There was a church not far from his home, however, and one day he wandered into it. He was never the same again, he said. "I began going to church at the age of 15, in the middle of a huge identity crisis," he said. "I was asking myself who am I, where am I from, what are my talents, and what will I become. I went into the church for answers, and became aware of a totally new life." 
IN many ways, Christianity leads a double life in Japan. From its earliest days, it has found its most enduring popularity among a tiny elite. As a social force, however, it is most vigorous on society's fringes, among outcasts, from death row criminals to prostitutes and the homeless.
Mr. Saito rebels against this dual tradition just as strongly as he rejects the idea of using his hot lines to proselytize. "Suicide is a big phenomenon among the well-to-do in our society," he said. "Christianity should not just focus its energies on the poorest. Its relevance must be demonstrated for everyone." 
The conversation with Mr. Saito, in a spare room in Lifeline's rented space in a Tokyo church, was scarcely tinged with the discussions of spirituality one would expect from a pastor.
SEVENTY percent of the country's suicides are committed by men, and almost everyone here invokes two causes: the huge social changes in the early postwar period and the protracted economic crisis of the last 12 years that has ravaged the careers of millions of "salarymen," or corporate employees.
To this, Mr. Saito adds a particular form of modern loneliness washing over Japan, where nuclear families occupy the same home but scarcely communicate, where dating and friendships are negotiated on the tiny screens of mobile phones, and where the phenomenon of shut-ins -- total, housebound seclusion -- has become endemic. "What we have seen is the collapse of the family throughout Japan, even in small towns," said Mr. Saito, who is married and has a grown son. "Loneliness has become universal." 
Although Lifeline's volunteers must master techniques like sensitivity training and role-playing, their most important service is simply keeping company with lonely strangers, Mr. Saito said.
"After talking with a caller for over an hour once, one counselor felt that things had been pretty well resolved," he said. "At the end, the woman said: 'Please don't hang up. You needn't say anything more, I'm just afraid of being alone.' "

HEADLINE: Famed Psychiatric Clinic Abandons Prairie Home 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
In its best years, it was a pearl on the prairie, a place where bold ideas sprouted like cornstalks under the Midwestern sun, a name that meant the best that American psychiatry had to offer.
 Troubled souls traveled long distances to find treatment and refuge beneath the pine trees on its grounds. Generations of healers trained in its classrooms. At 10 minutes to 4 each day -- a time dictated by the 50-minute psychoanalytic hour -- the staff gathered for tea and cookies in the clinic building, chatting with visitors like Margaret Mead, Aldous Huxley and Helen Keller, drawn by its intellectual aura. 
 A highway sign outside of town proclaimed: "Welcome to Topeka, Kansas, the psychiatric capital of the world." 
But the world has changed since the Menninger Clinic opened its doors 78 years ago in a farmhouse on Sixth Street. Today is the clinic's last day in Topeka. Its 29 remaining patients are scheduled to board a chartered jet this afternoon for Houston, where Menninger will reopen, in a partnership with the Baylor College of Medicine and the Methodist Hospital.
The clinic's move marks the symbolic end of an era of elite private hospitals, often in bucolic settings, where patients spent months or years sorting out their lives in what the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson termed a "psychosocial moratorium." Only one hospital in the United States still offers intensive long-term psychoanalytic treatment: The Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Mass., which survives, experts say, as a result of its location and small size, its relatively low overhead and its dedication to narrowly defined goals.
Like its counterparts, Menninger has been tossed and torn over the last two decades by the sea change in health care economics, the rise of managed care ending long hospital stays.
At the same time, psychiatry itself has undergone great changes. Many psychiatrists now believe that staying in the hospital for years can be detrimental for patients, promoting dependency. And the intensive psychoanalytic approach that was once the clinic's specialty has been edged to the perimeter by new drug treatments, brief psychotherapies and advances in neuroscience.
"I think historically, the time was over," said Dr. Robert Wallerstein, a former president of the American and International Psychoanalytic Associations who worked at Menninger from 1946 to 1966 and who remains a member of its board of trustees. "The idea of being able to take as much time as you need for individual people is not one that our society is collectively willing to sustain."
But Menninger's rise and decline in Topeka, said many people familiar with the clinic's history, also reflects the dynamics of the family who founded it, a family woven together by complex bonds of love and resentment, its influence expressed as often in sibling rivalries and noisy quarrels as in innovative ideas and compassionate acts. That turbulence was most notorious in the relations between the late Dr. Karl Menninger, known to everyone as Dr. Karl, and his youngest brother, the late Dr. William Menninger -- Dr. Will -- who founded the clinic with their father, Dr. Charles F. Menninger. But tensions have continued, in milder form, into the next generation.

A New Psychiatric Mix
Those moving to Houston say they regard the transition as an exciting beginning, a chance to meld the best of the Menninger tradition -- an intense focus on the individual patient, and an expertise in sorting outdifficult cases -- with the research and scientific tools available at a major medical center.
"I think what has happened is a good evolution," said Dr. Jon Allen, a psychologist and expert on trauma and depression who has been at Menninger for 27 years and will, like other staff members, become part of Baylor's new Menninger Department of Psychiatry. "I hope that we will get the best of both worlds."
The clinic's new home on 14 acres in west Houston, Dr. Allen said, "is not like this with hills and deer, but it's actually quite pretty."
Others are far more dubious.
"One can no more move the Menninger that many of us came to Topeka for than you can move the London Bridge to Arizona," wrote one psychiatrist in a letter to Psychiatric News, the newsletter of the American Psychiatric Association, after the clinic's intention to relocate was announced.
Dr. Roy Menninger, Dr. Will's eldest son, who served as Menninger's president from 1967 to 1993, said in an interview that he knows the move is inevitable but remains troubled by it.
"I can't stand here without many more feelings than I can accommodate, much less explain," Dr. Menninger told an audience at a reception held on May 22 at the Topeka and Shawnee Public Library, which has inherited a collection of Menninger books and artifacts.
But Roy's younger brother, Dr. Walter Menninger, who succeeded him as president in 1993, strongly backed the move, after business consultants recommended partnering with an academic medical school, in an urban center, closer to an airport.
"I'm nostalgic, but I also recognize you can't live in the past," Dr. Menninger said.
In fact, the institution, which in the years after World War II trained 5 to 7 percent of American psychiatrists and ran one of the nation's top psychoanalytic institutes, the Topeka Institute of Psychoanalysis, has been a ghost of its former self for nearly a decade. With its budget increasingly pressed, Menninger tried diversifying in the early 1990's, then sharply downsized several years later, angering many who worked there. There are now only 8 psychiatrists on staff, compared with 80 in the late 1980's. The psychoanalytic institute closed in 2001. 
Yet the clinic was lucky to have survived at all. Chestnut Lodge, a family-run psychiatric hospital in Rockville, Md., also known for its psychoanalytic treatment, was bought by a private mental health organization reportedly for $4 million in 1996, then closed in 2001.

Catering to the Refined
Like many early private psychiatric hospitals -- Austen Riggs, Chestnut Lodge, the Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in Towson, Md., McLean Hospital near Boston and others -- Menninger built its reputation in the first half of the 20th century.
Many of the hospitals catered to wealthy patients, "persons of education and social refinement," as the journalist Dwight MacDonald noted in a 1935 article in Fortune magazine. Their grounds were verdant and meticulously manicured, often with the help of patients who gardened as part of their therapy. Artists and movie stars sought treatment for alcoholism, depression or "exhaustion," as nervous breakdowns were sometimes euphemistically called.
"At Craig House in the hills above Beacon, N.Y., the 50 patients were transported in chauffeur-driven limousines, enjoyed their own golf course, and drank wine from the hospital's private vineyards," wrote Dr. Lawrence J. Friedman in a 1990 biography, "Menninger: The Family and the Clinic."
In the decades after World War II, with psychoanalysis in ascendance, the hospitals had waiting lists: inits heyday, Menninger had 280 or more patients in intensive treatment, 70 of them in psychoanalysis.
Once admitted, patients might spend two or three years within the institutions' sheltering walls, building an identity, a network of friends, a way of living apart from the world outside.
"If any patient came in for only a week, it was considered to be an inappropriate treatment," said Dr. Steven S. Sharfstein, who took over the direction of Sheppard Pratt in 1981, and presided over its transformation into the Sheppard Pratt Health System. Dr. Sharfstein said in-hospital care now plays only a small role. The average hospital stay is nine days.
But in its earlier incarnation, Dr. Sharfstein said, Sheppard Pratt kept patients far longer. "The hospital was the treatment and patients either got better or they ran out of insurance," he said. "That was what was happening for about 100 years."
Some experts lament the loss of a time when patients could recover over time in a sheltered setting. But Dr. Sharfstein believes the shift to shorter stays, though forced by changing economics, was beneficial.
"I think the data is pretty clear," he said. "The hospital is really useful for a short stay, and as you get into a longer stay, you have diminishing returns."
Menninger, like other hospitals, evolved with the times, though its length of stay -- six to eight weeks -- remains longer than most hospitals. It has developed a reputation as a last-chance treatment center for patients with complicated diagnostic problems, many of whom have been hospitalized numerous times for shorter periods with little benefit.
"It is really the last place you can get an intensive psychological work-up," said Dr. Stuart Twemlow, a psychoanalyst and the medical director of the clinic's Hope program, which treats adults with serious and longstanding mental disorders. The patients who come to Menninger, Dr. Twemlow said, often arrive speaking of themselves "like a bag of chemicals."
"We introduce the psychology, so people can become thinking beings," he said.

The Family Business
From its inception, Menninger was filled with bigger dreams and more colorful personalities than many of its competitors. Charles Menninger, a country doctor schooled in homeopathic cures and devoted to horticulture, wanted to build a center of training, medical care and research much like the Mayo clinic. He was overjoyed when his oldest and youngest sons, Karl and Will, followed him into medicine.
The Menninger family was of solid Presbyterian stock, passionate about social causes and firmly rooted in Midwestern tradition. Karl, charismatic and mercurial, impatient with stupid questions and doctors without neckties, gained fame with his 1930 book, "The Human Mind," the first volume to explain Freudian theory to the American public. Residents were spellbound by his lectures -- and fearful of his sharp tongue.
Will, more even-tempered and socially skilled than his brother, became the Army's chief psychiatrist in the last years of World War II and made the cover of Time magazine in 1948, billed as "Psychiatry's U.S. Sales Manager."
Together, the two men created a intellectual center so powerful that it pulled people to Kansas, even those -- New Yorkers, European emigres fleeing Hitler's advance -- who had previously believed nothing of importance could coexist with rodeos and soybean fields.
"It really was a place where the brightest lights in psychiatry, psychoanalysis, clinical psychology and social work gathered," said Dr. Howard Shevrin, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who worked at Menninger from 1954 to 1973.
The hospital cared for its share of celebrities: The actress Gene Tierney was a patient there and later worked in a dress shop in town. But it also treated people suffering from schizophrenia or other severe psychoses. In the postwar years, with thousands of veterans suffering from combat stress, Menninger trained hundreds of psychiatric residents for the Veterans Administration, now the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Southard School was opened for emotionally disturbed children. "Freud and friendliness" was a Menninger slogan. 
New therapies grew as sturdily as the peonies that Dr. Charles Menninger planted on the campus. Patients chopped wood, grew vegetables and spoke, in quiet consulting rooms, of secrets they had never told anyone before.
Yet if a vision bound Karl and Will Menninger together, their differences drove them apart.
Karl was a lifelong Democrat, who spent every Christmas Eve visiting the prisoners at the county jail, belonged to the American Civil Liberties Union and distrusted the conventional and the pretentious.
Will, too, had a social conscience: Between 1953 and 1965, he addressed 23 state legislatures, according to Menninger documents, urging the lawmakers to improve the conditions in state hospitals. He voted Republican, dined with corporate executives and knew the value of raising money.
Despite his international reknown, Karl was jealous of his younger brother, said family members and psychiatrists who knew both men. Will, for his part, was perpetually frustrated by Karl's whims and unpredictable outbursts.
In an episode known in Menninger lore as the "palace revolution," Will acceded to the demands of senior staff members and removed Karl as chief of staff.
Dr. Wallerstein recalled stopping into Karl's office on a visit to Menninger shortly afterward. Two calendars were on the wall, he said, both draped in black.
"One said 'the month they killed Jack Kennedy,' the other was 'the month they killed Karl Menninger,' " Dr. Wallerstein said.
After Will's death in 1966, some trustees and staff members argued that it was time for Menninger to be run by businessmen rather than family members. But, perhaps because the family's spirit still pervaded the institution so intensely, Roy Menninger followed his father into the presidency.

Transplanting to Texas
In the next 26 years, Roy had his supporters and his critics. So did his brother Walter, when he took over as president in 1993. The brothers' relationship, more peaceable that that of their father and uncle, has still had its strains, as both freely say. Karl Menninger died in 1990 at the age of 96.
When the plan to move to Houston was first announced in the spring of 2000, many staff members were in shock.
"Clinicians were walking around the campus crying," said Dr. Allen.
In a telephone interview, Dr. Walter Menninger said he knew that some people blame him for the downsizing and the decision to relocate.
"It took me a long time to figure out that this institution always likes to have two Menningers"-- one good and one bad, he said. "Right now, I'm the bad Menninger and Roy is the good Menninger."
Once in Houston, the clinic will take in more patients and hire more staff members; 80 are moving from Topeka, according to Menninger. A board of directors, made up of representatives from Menninger, Baylor and the Methodist Hospital, will oversee the clinic's operation. Another board will preside over the Menninger Foundation.
The Houston area, said Dr. Stuart Yudofsky, Baylor's chairman ofpsychiatry, has "great needs, from a variety of perspectives, for the services that Menninger has traditionally provided."
In Topeka, meanwhile, strong feelings remain.
"I'd rather have seen us go down swinging," sighed Dr. Irwin Rosen, a psychoanalyst who was Menninger's director of the adult outpatient department until 2001. "But we took the third strike with the bat on our shoulders."
What remains is the future, "an empirical question," as one staff member put it, of how a Kansas-bred institution will take to Texas soil.
"This place has, I think, done its dying with dignity," said Dr. Twemlow, who is going to Houston. "And hopefully, it will be like the phoenix -- whatever comes up will be, in some way, Menninger."

HEADLINE: MARATHON; 
Marathon Is Set to Name Its First Title Sponsor

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
The 34-year-old New York City Marathon has gone the route of college football bowl games and signed a title corporate sponsor.
 On Monday, New York Road Runners will announce a three-year deal with ING, a financial services company based in the Netherlands. Race officials declined to disclose terms of the agreement, but a person familiar with the deal said it was worth close to $6 million. 
 Allan Steinfeld, president and chief executive of the Road Runners and director of the marathon, said the signing of a title sponsor reflected the realities of a soft economy. Pontiac has not renewed its automobile sponsorship of the race, and J.P. Morgan Chase is reducing its longtime support, Steinfeld said in an interview on Thursday. 
The 26.2-mile race, scheduled for Nov. 2, will be called the ING New York City Marathon.
"It was ensuring our viability in tough economic times," Steinfeld said.
Deeper pockets also should allow organizers to make more attractive financial pitches to such elite stars as Khalid Khannouchi of the United States and Paula Radcliffe of Britain, who hold the men's and women's world records in the marathon.
"It will certainly help us," Steinfeld said.
Khannouchi and Radcliffe have preferred to run fall marathons in Chicago, which has a flatter, more record-friendly course, and which has reportedly paid the two up to $250,000 apiece in appearance fees.
World records set by the two in Chicago -- and later broken by them in London -- have overshadowed the New York City Marathon in recent years. And a cash infusion from ING will not change the picture immediately.
Khannouchi has committed to run Chicago again in October, and Radcliffe has said she will not run another marathon this year after lowering her world record in London last month. Deena Drossin, the American women's record-holder, will serve only as a pacer this fall in New York for American women seeking to qualify for the Olympic trials.
But Radcliffe and Drossin have indicated they will run the 10,000 meters, not the marathon, in the heat of Athens at the 2004 Summer Games, which could make them available to run in New York next year. Steinfeld said he would also place Khannouchi on his wish list for 2004, although it seems highly unlikely he would run a fall marathon two months after the Olympics.
New York officials are also considering an increase in the $80,000 awarded for first place, and may match the $100,000 given to the victors in Chicago, Steinfeld said.
At the same time, he stressed, New York did not see itself in competition with Chicago. "We're a different race, and we'll continue to be," Steinfeld said.
In New York, there are about 29,975 runners in a field of 30,000 who are unconcerned with winning. For them, the marathon is pitched as a celebration of the city and its diversity.
A close competitive race is preferred to a time trial with one or two runners leaving everyone behind, Steinfeld said. No world records are likely to be set in New York, with its bridges and hills, but reputations can be forged there as no place else, he said.
"If you think you have a chance to win, you come to Broadway and you perform, as opposed to Off Broadway," Steinfeld said.
On Monday, organizers will announce the return of Marla Runyan, the legally blind runner who finished fourth in her marathon debut last year. In addition, Dieter Baumann of Germany, the 1992 Olympic 5,000-meter (3.1-mile) champion, will compete, and there is speculation that Bob Kennedy, the American record-holder at 5,000 meters, will also move up to the longer distance.
The lottery drawing for entrants for this year's marathon will be posted at www.nycmarathon.org on June 11. This year's race will start an hour earlier -- 9:35 a.m. for elite women, and 10:10 for elite men and the masses, Steinfeld said. This will reduce waiting at the start and will allow more runners to finish in daylight.
Steinfeld said this year's marathon would feature a contest within the race to help pay for running programs and improve recreational facilities in New York and in other countries.
ING has recently become the title sponsor of the Amsterdam Marathon and is planning to sponsor other races, said Shaun Mathews, an executive vice president of the company. "As we looked at the things where we could get ourselves better known and bring fresh ideas to a sport, running hit us as one of the truly global sports," he said in a telephone interview.

HEADLINE: Historians Trace an Unholy Alliance; 
Religion as the Root Of Nationalist Feeling

BYLINE:  By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
When Shiite Muslims in Iraq took to the streets to protest the presence of American troops as well as Saddam Hussein, was the world witnessing the birth of nationalism? When President Bush used the term crusade to describe the war on terrorism, was he inadvertently revealing religious roots in American patriotism? In short, is religious sentiment, long considered the prime enemy of nationalism, actually one of its founding elements? 
 This iconoclastic theory has been gaining ground among historians. Until recently, there was a growing scholarly consensus that nationalism was a distinctly modern phenomenon, aproduct of post-Enlightenment culture. Public celebrations of the Fatherland, the creation of national anthems and devotion to the flag all occurred in the wake of the French and American Revolutions. 
 As several essayists show in the 1995 collection "The Invention of Tradition," edited by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger (Cambridge University Press), many of the great national traditions we tend to think of as originating in the mists of the distant past -- like the clan tartans of the Scottish highlanders -- were 19th-century inventions, meant to generate national pride. 
But Peter Sahlins, a historian at the University of California at Berkeley, who is working on a book on the nature of citizenship in early modern France, says the idea that religious intolerance is the "original sin" of nationalism is getting more and more attention. "I think it's a healthy corrective to the modernist consensus," he said.
Mr. Sahlins notes that prevailing theories of nationalism have a way of following the mood of the times. When Serbs, Croats and Muslims were killing one another in the Balkans, many commentators originally pointed to the eternal and atavistic origins of ethnic violence, not recognizing that the different groups had lived in relative harmony under the Ottoman Empire and even under Tito. 
"Now the context in which we see nationalism has completely changed," he said. Faced with the threat of Islamic fundamentalism, the West is more open to looking at the role of religion in the formation of nationalism. 
One of the most recent contributions to this trend is "Faith in Nation: Exclusionary Origins of Nationalism" (Oxford University Press, 2003), by Anthony W. Marx, a professor of political science at Columbia University, who was recently named president of Amherst College. Mr. Marx insists that the birth of nationalism dates to a time when religious intolerance ravaged Europe. He begins his book in 1492, the year that King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, who united Castille and Aragon to form the new kingdom of Spain, ousted the Moors from Southern Spain and decided to expel the Jews from their territory. The Spanish Inquisition, Mr. Marx writes, was a central mechanism in consolidating power and conferring legitimacy on the new Spanish state. 
Linda Colley, a historian at the London School of Economics and the author of the 1992 book "Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707-1837" (Yale University Press), agrees that religion is central to nationalism.
According to Ms. Colley and Mr. Marx, nationalism begins with an act of demonizing a religious "other" and creating a sense of community by defining an "us" and a "them." Recognizing this, they argue, may help Westerners better understand, for example, the contemporary phenomena of Islamic fundamentalism and Arab nationalism.
"If we fail to look at our own history, we run the risk of being too self-congratulatory and too dismissive of others," Mr. Marx said. "When we see Shiites demonstrating in Iraq, we tend to reject or denigrate, forgetting that we went through similar processes."
Both Mr. Marx and Ms. Colley focus on the Protestant Reformation, insisting that the religious conflicts it unleashed played an important role in the creation of Europe's principal nation-states. Leaders used religion to consolidate their own power, turning themselves into both political and religious leaders. Before full-blown nationalism, religious passion was the one popular emotion that could bring masses of people into the streets, and Europe's rulers understood that it could be used to make or break a state. 
"A number of European monarchs start appealing to the people to carry out the Protestant Reformation," Ms. Colley said. "You can see it very graphically in England in the 16th century, where they get rid of holy images in the church and replace them with the royal coat of arms. So you don't worship images of the saints, you worship the monarch as the head of the church. A lot of countries -- Britain, Sweden, Holland -- see themselves as the new Israel, the holy nation. The American colonies inherit this tradition as the City on the Hill." 
European rulers also exploited fear of outside interference, demonizing the Roman Catholic Church to rally people around the throne. 
In Britain, Mr. Marx writes, the crown's defiance of the Church of Rome strengthened the power of the state and helped to sharpen the definition of what it meant to be English. Queen Elizabeth I finally yielded to pressures to have Mary Queen of Scots, her Catholic rival, executed, and made attendance at Anglican religious services mandatory. John Foxe, a Protestant author of the Elizabethan era, wrote that the Queen had come to represent "the link and identity between the Protestant and national causes." 
Mr. Marx quotes the British historian Lewis Namier, who once wrote that "religion is a 16th-century word for nationalism."
Catherine de Medici, Queen Regent of France, similarly exploited religious passion. After trying to mediate between the Catholics and the Huguenots, she manipulated anti-Huguenot feeling and in 1572 helped plot the infamous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which more than 15,000 Protestants were slaughtered in and around Paris. 
"Nationalism thus began to emerge by piggybacking on the passion of religious conflicts," Mr. Marx writes. 
Still, many scholars are skeptical. 
"If the point is that state building enlisted religion, then that makes good sense, but I am not sure we are talking about nationalism," said Eugen Weber, a professor emeritus of history at the University of California at Los Angeles and an expert on French nationalism. 
Modernists like Mr. Weber and others insist that the early modern states were fundamentally different, multilingual, multiethnic entities in which the sense of nation had not yet been firmly established. "The kings of Spain governed over modern Belgium and Austria, as well as parts of what are now France, Italy, Slovenia and Croatia," said David A. Bell, a historian who argues that the French Revolution was the critical event in establishing French nationalism.
Before that, he pointed out, the royal families of Europe married across national lines, and no one worried much over whether a German sat on the throne of England, Italians ran France, or Spaniards governed Austria. 
"With the French Revolution, rulers do not simply require obedience, but homogeneity," Mr. Bell said. "They are concerned that people read the same books, identify with the same history, see themselves as having something innate in common and as part of a national project. It's not that national feeling didn't exist before, but nationalism, as I see it, implies a program to make people the same."
While the kings of France cared little that most of their subjects spoke various languages, post-revolutionary leaders began to insist on standardized language and education. This happened not just in France, but in reactionary Austro-Hungary, where in the 1780's, the Hapsburgs made German the official language of administration. The increased complexity of modern administration -- with the need for a vast bureaucracy ofliterate bureaucrats -- made Latin impractical and the use of vernacular German essential, suddenly sharpening the Magyar, Romanian, Czech and Italian subjects' sense of themselves as discriminated minorities with their own national identities. 
The increased identification of nationality with language in the late 18th and 19th centuries has led many scholars to see the print revolution and widespread literacy as crucial factors in the formation of nationalism. "From the start, the nation was conceived in language, not in blood," Benedict Anderson wrote in 1983 in his classic book "Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism." 
Mr. Marx reverses this formulation, insisting that nationalism is soaked in blood. "Terrible to say, less blood proved less binding, for nothing is as powerful a basis of mass passion and cohesion than killings," he said. While Mr. Marx grants the importance of both literacy and industrialization in the creation of full-blown, 19th-century nationalism, he insists that the period of religious strife in 16th- and 17th-century Europe forms an important precedent. "You can think of it as a kind of proto-nationalism," he said.
Ms. Colley, meanwhile, dismisses the idea that nationalism can come about only with literacy and a nation of voting citizens. "I think you have to look at religion as a crucial part of identity in many preliterate societies," she said. "Most of the people who starting resisting the British Raj in India could not read or write, but they felt passionately Indian. The Russians who put up a fierce resistance to Napoleon's invasion were often illiterate but had a strong sense of holy mother Russia and the land as scripture."
Ms. Colley said she was not surprised that there was reluctance to accept the religious roots of nationalism. "Americans are in denial about their own nationalism," added Ms. Colley, who is British but has taught for many years in the United States. "They say, 'We don't do nationalism, we are a multiethnic country, we have patriotism.' But the U.S. still sees itself as the City on a Hill, fighting against 'the axis of evil.' Americans have a very theologically rooted sense of nation."

HEADLINE: Brazil's Leader Steps Gingerly Onto World Stage 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, May 28 

 BODY:
On-the-job training is nothing new to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He did it nearly 40 years ago as an apprentice lathe operator, and now, as the novice president of Latin America's largest country, he is going through the process all over again.
 It is not just that he has been studying economics textbooks so as to get a better grip on the subject that provides his most difficult challenge. Mr. da Silva has also been revising certain long-cherished notions of the world and the way it operates, even if it displeases the left-wing constituency that helped elect him Brazil's first worker-president last year. 
 "When God created human beings, he made the head round so that ideas can circulate" and "we can change our minds every now and then," he said during an hourlong interview with seven foreign reporters at the presidential palace here this week. "I've had to adjust to reality," he added, "and work on the basis of that reality and not my aspirations." 
In Mr. da Silva's case, that has meant shelving much of the ambitious social agenda that got him elected by a record margin. Instead, he has raised interest rates, introduced a fiscal reform package that would trim pension benefits and increase tax revenues and reduced government spending in order to meet budget surplus targets set in an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
"The Workers' Party changed because reality changed, it changed because it is in government," he maintained. "That is a natural change."
The conference with reporters was Mr. da Silva's first since taking office in January and preceded what promises to be a burst of activity and exposure for him at home and abroad. True to Mr. da Silva's casual style, the meeting was classified as a "conversation" rather than a formal interview, which meant under the ground rules that his remarks could not be taped or filmed.
Mr. da Silva was the only head of state to attend both the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum in January, reflecting his origins as a leftist labor leader and his new status as a statesman. But his real debut on the global stage will come when he attends the Group of 8 meeting in Evian, France, next week and on June 20, when he is scheduled to visit President Bush in Washington.
Mr. Bush is in many ways Mr. da Silva's opposite in ideology and upbringing. The Brazilian president is skeptical of an American-sponsored free-trade agreement, criticized even the American military action against terrorism in Afghanistan and was recently quoted in a magazine here as saying that Mr. Bush was "delirious" in his insistence on military action to solve the Iraq problem.
But Mr. da Silva appears to take a more pragmatic view of the man he has jokingly called "Comrade Bush" than he and his party have in the past. "I can't ask George Bush to be the president I want him to be, and he can't ask me to be the president he would like me to be," he said. "We have to learn to live with each other as we are."
This new, seemingly tamer version of Mr. da Silva has become the darling of the I.M.F. and the same Wall Street investors whose dread of a Workers' Party government helped drive up the interest and exchange rates during last year's presidential campaign here. In neighboring Argentina, for instance, the new president, Nestor Kirchner, finds himself being urged to "be like Lula and not like Hugo Chavez," Venezuela's combative populist president.
"It's not an ideological change," Mr. da Silva responded when asked if his partywas moving toward the center or still regarded itself as Socialist. "We still believe in all the things that we always have."
Nevertheless, Mr. da Silva seems to be following a trajectory similar to that of his predecessor in office. "Fernando Henrique Cardoso turned his back on his own theory too," recalled David Fleischer, publisher of the Brazil Focus political newsletter and a professor of political science at the National University here.
As one of the authors of "dependency theory," Mr. Cardoso became a favorite of the Latin American left by arguing that countries on the "periphery" of the capitalist system were doomed to exploitation by the "center." But by the time he became president in 1995, he had abandoned that opinion, in language almost identical to that Mr. da Silva has now begun using.
"I'm fed up with meeting presidents of Latin American countries who blame imperialism for the misfortunes of the third world," Mr. da Silva said in a recent speech. "That's nonsense. We are victims only of our own incompetence."
Such statements dismay the orthodox left in Brazil and in the rest of Latin America, which greeted Mr. da Silva's election as a watershed. They now accuse him of becoming "more Catholic than the pope" in pursuing the I.M.F.'s recipe and of abandoning his principles to lead a government that is to the right of Mr. Cardoso's.
Mr. da Silva and his supporters say that is nonsense. "If Marx were alive, he would probably say 'come up with answers to your 21st-century reality and not our 19th-century Manchester reality,' " Luiz Dulci, the Workers' Party's main ideologist for many years and now a member of the president's personal staff, said in April.
Mr. Cardoso also argued that it was necessary to reform and modernize the Brazilian economy so as to prepare it for a burst of rapid growth, but that never came during his eight years in office. Mr. da Silva said he believes the Brazilian people have given him "a year's tolerance" and that growth will resume next year, but his critics on the left say he is merely repeating Mr. Cardoso's error.
Mr. da Silva recently apologized to Mr. Cardoso's party for opposing reforms they had introduced and which he has embraced now that he is in power. "Not everyone goes to sleep or gets up at the same time," he argued, which led one leading opposition figure to describe the Workers' Party as "the party of the late risers."
Angered by Mr. da Silva's turnabout on the pension and tax package, radicals within the Workers' Party recently made public a tape of a 1987 speech in which Mr. da Silva criticized the very measures he is now seeking to have approved as president. Mr. da Silva's aides have threatened the so-called Shiites with expulsion from the party, and to make up for their loss of support have stitched together an alliance with a centrist party.
Even Mr. da Silva's own vice president, a conservative textile magnate who was chosen as a peace offering to the business community, has now joined the chorus of critics. "We can't remain at the mercy of these people who have put us in a straitjacket" Jose Alencar complained last week when the Central Bank refused to lower interest rates, which are near a historic high.
"I'm not one to suffer much from stress," Mr. da Silva said when asked about the barbs coming from within his own camp. "I don't lose a night's sleep over little things." But he is very much aware of both the historic burden and "the symbolism of a lathe operator as president," he said.
"My failure would not be just the failure of a president," Mr. da Silva explained. "It would be the failure of a movement that would not be able to raise its head for the next 50 years, and it would have repercussions abroad."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP: RUSSIA; 
St. Petersburg Is Given Some Major Primping For Its Birthday Bash

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, May 30 

 BODY:
Its manhole covers sealed, rain-dispersing air force circling aloft, unsightly shacks summarily torched, quadrilingual phrase books issued to police and cellular phone encryption disabled, Russia's baroque czarist capital is girded this weekend to wrap President Bush and nearly 45 other world leaders in an extravagant bear hug to celebrate its 300th birthday. 
 Peter, as the locals call it, has perhaps not been at once this radiant and this tense since the Russian Revolution, in 1917. 
 Aboard a gleaming white cruise liner in the Neva River, President Vladimir V. Putin convened a summit meeting today of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the club of leaders of former Soviet nations. On Saturday comes a summit meeting with leaders of the European Union, followed on Sunday by a 90-minute one-on-one with Mr. Bush. 
Presidents Putin and Bush will focus in particular on rekindling a relationship dampened by the United States' invasion of Iraq. The two also are expected to talk about Iran's nuclear ambitions and to exchange ratified copies of the Treaty of Moscow, the year-old agreement to reduce the active nuclear arsenals of their two nations. 
So much for the official excuses for this weekend's appearance of most global statesmen, leaders from Italy to India and China to the Czech Republic, in this city of 4.5 million. 
In fact, this is nothing less than a fabulous slumber party for the world's most powerful men (and three women, the leaders of Latvia and Finland and the Spanish foreign minister) -- a weekend of laser shows, concerts, sailing regattas, and literally palatial parties in an imperial city where it currently does not get dark until well after 1 a.m. 
Every minute bears the personal stamp of Mr. Putin, a native Petersburger whose passion for his hometown has propelled more than $1.3 billion in federal spending to replaster and paint his city's grimy facades, repave its roads and repair its great monuments for the party. 
Private businesses contributed at least another $290 million to restore the Konstantin Palace, conceived by Peter the Great as his personal Versailles, and ready it for Saturday's European summit meeting. 
Many ordinary people here are grousing about the spending on palaces rather than on crumbling infrastructure, about the smell of corruption in repair contracts and about the omnipresent security that has kept them a discreet distance from the V.I.P. spots to view the celebrations.
One Internet site, only half-facetiously titled "St. Petersburg: 300 Troubles," chronicles everything from the filling of the city's port with empty ships (presumably to thwart terrorists) to one man's effort to stop federal officials from encamping a sniper in his apartment. 
Manholes were sealed along one main street to thwart inventive terrorists, and the federal government double-checked a list of the city's 138,000 registered firearms owners to weed out some 2,000 potential threats. Mobile phone companies disabled encryption of signals for their 2.4 million St. Petersburg customers for the duration of the festivities. 
Beneath the grumbling about overreaching, though, runs a thread of pride that Russia's second city is getting its long-delayed due. 
"We took lots of pictures and bought lots of postcards, and we're going to make albums to celebrate the anniversary of my city," 77-year-old Anna K. Kostina said as she stood in Palace Square after having her photo snapped with an actor dressed as Peter the Great. "We'll send copies to all our relatives -- in Ukraine, in Voronezh, in Pittsburgh." 
"Our mother saw the original Amber Room before it was stolen," one daughter, Nadezhda, chimed in, "and now we hope to see it after the restoration."
The famed Amber Room, presumably lost to German invaders during World War II, has been recreated and will be formally unveiled on Saturday during a ceremony in the Great Catherine Palace, a 286-year-old restored mansion in Tsarskoye Selo, a village outside St. Petersburg. 
Despite all the money lavished on the city, a few blemishes still show. Moscow has grabbed most of the power and foreign money in Russia's 12 years of independence, leaving this city to struggle with abysmal housing, medieval heating and mediocre economic prospects. 
But even a blemished Peter leaves its richer rival looking pale and provincial by comparison. Most major monuments and palaces have been refurbished or repainted in classic Russian pastels, as have most major buildings along the wide Neva River, luminous walls of color in the acutely angled sunlight of the city's White Nights. 
Determined to impress the world, Russians have spared little excess in their civic primping. The city has strung nearly 2,800 flags from poles and lampposts around town, and borrowed $31 million from the World Bank to refurbish its historic main boulevard, Nevsky Prospekt. 
The thousands of militia members have each been issued blue 119-page pocket-size booklets offering English, French and German translations of what are purported to be typical Russian law-enforcement phrases. 
"Comrades! (Gentlemen!) You are violating the peace!" one helpful militiaman read in a literal translation and the thickest of accents. And, "Comrades! (Gentlemen!) You are not allowed to sing loudly/to turn high your transistor radio (tape recorder) in the streets!"
Main roads leading to Konstantin Palace, set magnificently on the Gulf of Finland about a dozen miles outside downtown, have been repaved, repainted and festooned with uniformed militiamen every hundred yards or so. To great scorn, most evidence of dilapidation and decay -- that is, the wooden cabins and kitchen gardens of average Russian peasants -- has been blotted out by high green picket fences, some of them plastered with advertising. 
Nearly 60 sheds and huts across the street from the palace, thrown up by gardeners during the years when it was a windowless, roofless hulk, abruptly went up in smoke about a month ago, shortly before a fence was erected to cover their remains. 
Officials blamed hooligans for the fires, which makes the gardeners smile. "There was a special team of people who said they had orders to burn them down," Aleksandr I. Shalagin, 70, who has lived in the area for 49 years, said during a pause in his gardening this week. "They wore orange jackets like road workers. They didn't hide. It was the middle of the day."
Peter was gloriously sunny and cloudless most of this week. But as skies began to glower today, the government ordered a fleet of 10 military aircraft aloft to bomb the approaching clouds with "environmentally pure substances and internationally certified chemicals" to wring the rain from them before they reached town. 
It was a master example of the fastidiousness with which officials have approached this grand city's tricentennial. But as V.I.P. planes began heading en masse into Pulkovo Airport this afternoon, it was cloudy and drizzling.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SOUTHEAST ASIA; 
Philippine Camps Are Training Al Qaeda's Allies, Officials Say

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: MANILA, May 30 

 BODY:
The southern Philippines has become the training center for Al Qaeda's Southeast Asia affiliate, Jemaah Islamiyah, drawing recruits from a number of countries, according to Western and Philippine officials. 
 For the last six to nine months, recruits mostly from Indonesia and Malaysia, but also a few from as far off as Pakistan and the Middle East, have received training at inaccessible, rough-hewn sites -- basically a few huts and some tents -- in a marshy region on the island of Mindanao, officials said. 
 The training is similar to what their older colleagues in terrorism got in Afghanistan when that served as Al Qaeda's base, they added. 
In Mindanao, though, the training appears to include more of a special emphasis on the use of sophisticated explosives, the officials said. 
"We've closed the camps in Afghanistan, but they're still operating in the southern Philippines," said an Australian official in Canberra. 
More broadly, intelligence officials say there is a constant movement of international terrorists across an area that includes Mindanao, islands in the Sulu Sea, the Malaysian state of Sabah and northern Indonesia. 
A joint American-Philippine military exercise scheduled to begin in a few weeks will have its locus on Sulu, a group of islands in the middle of that zone.
"I'm convinced that Jemaah Islamiyah, Al Qaeda and fellow travelers are able to move around Southeast Asia fairly freely," a Western diplomat said.
Jemaah Islamiyah has been linked to the nightclub bombings that killed more than 200 people last year on the Indonesian island of Bali. The group's leader is Abu Bakar Bashir, American and Indonesian officials have said. He has not been charged in the Bali case but is now on trial on treason charges and in the bombings of several churches in Indonesia in December 2000. He has denied the charges. 
The training camps are in an area under the control of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has been waging a guerrilla war for an independent state for 25 years, officials said.
Hundreds of Qaeda recruits trained at Moro camps in the late1990's, including some of the men being tried in the Bali bombing, Western officials said. But those camps were destroyed by the Philippine Army in 2000, and Moro rebels have steadfastly denied any links to Al Qaeda.
A new round of training began at several sites six to nine months ago, officials said. Similarly, in recent months, Al Qaeda has reorganized bases of operation in a number of other places, including Kenya, Sudan and Chechnya, according to senior counterterrorism officials in Washington, Europe and the Middle East.
At the Moro camps, courses vary in length from two weeks to three months, instructors are Indonesians and Arabs as well as Filipinos, and graduates receive a certificate, a Philippine intelligence officer said. There are 30 to 40 students in a class, most of them Filipinos joining the Moro rebels, along with the foreigners sent by Jemaah Islamiyah, he said.
In one class, students learn to take apart a watch, then put it together again as a timer for an explosive device, he said. There is also a heavy dose of Islamic religious teaching.
The number of Jemaah Islamiyah recruits who have gone through the recent training might be considered relatively small -- perhaps not more than 50, one intelligence official said -- but officials point out that a terrorist attack does not require a great number of men.
Besides, officials said, it is not the number that is alarming. The existence of the training "shows that while all the focus has been on Afghanistan, there remains in our region the infrastructure to continue to train people in terrorism," said an Australian official in Canberra.
In interviews in several countries, officials confirmed the Qaeda training that they said was now taking place in the southern Philippines. They admitted that their information was sketchy, and they were reluctant to provide details.
"You're into a highly classified area here," an American official said.
In general, the information has come from interrogations of Moro front and Jemaah Islamiyah members who have been captured in Malaysia and Indonesia as well as here.
The relationship between the Moro group, Jemaah Islamiyah and Al Qaeda demonstrates the amorphous nature of the Qaeda movement. The Moro rebels have a limited goal: an independent Islamic state on Mindanao. Jemaah Islamiyah, which was founded in the early 1970's and has been declared a terrorist organization by the United States State Department, seeks the establishment of an Islamic state across an arc of Southeast Asia.
Al Qaeda has often been likened to a franchise operation, with Jemaah Islamiyah as the Southeast Asia franchisee. Recently, the Indonesian government has begun to crack down on the group, arresting a number of its leaders, including Mr. Bashir.
In the mid-1990's, when he was looking for places to train recruits outside Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden sent an emissary to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which controlled territory and already had a military training course for its own purposes.
One Philippine group that Mr. bin Laden rejected an affiliation with was Abu Sayyaf, which Filipino officials say has degenerated into a group of bandits under a facade of Islamic radicalism.
Later this summer the United States will conduct a joint military operation in the southern Philippines. It is officially termed a training exercise, and its objective is the defeat of Abu Sayyaf, the notorious kidnapping-for-ransom group, whose beheaded victims include one American.
Questions have been raised, by many Filipinos as well as officials in governments closely allied with the United States in the campaign against terrorism, about why the United States is going after Abu Sayyaf and not the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
Abu Sayyaf is "practically null and void," said a senior diplomat from one of America's major allies.
An official from another country said, "To take out Abu Sayyaf may make everyone feel good, but it doesn't remove a large chunk of the problem."
American officials say the only solution to the Abu Sayyaf problem is a military one because the group has no real political goal about which to negotiate. 
But one official said that was not the case with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which is not considered a terrorist organization by the United States. Therefore, he said, a a negotiated political solution is possible. 
The group has longstanding grievances about decades of ill treatment and neglect of the Moro ethnic group on Mindanao, which is Muslim. Although the island has some of the most fertile land in the Philippines, supporting vast pineapple and banana plantations, it is one of the poorest regions of the country, with the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy.
"The M.I.L.F. is becoming stronger and stronger, both in terms of numbers and in support from the local population," said one ambassador. "The economic situation in Mindanao is so bad that the people have nothing to lose by joining the M.I.L.F."
The Philippine government's policy toward the Moro front has been markedly inconsistent, several diplomats here noted this week.
It has done everything except engage in a serious development program in Mindanao, one ambassdor said. The government has always talked about development and appointed cabinet ministers and committees to deal with the issue, the ambassador added, but it has never spent serious money.
Until recently the government thought it could negotiate with the Moro rebels, but that changed after terrorist attacks in March and April at the airport in Davao, the largest city in Mindanao, and at a market.
As a result, on the eve of her state visit to Washington earlier this month, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo turned the army loose against the Moro rebels.
At the conclusion of that visit, President Bush announced that the United States would commit itself diplomatically and financially to finding a negotiated solution to the war.
The American role, which includes a promise of at least $30 million in development assistance, has been embraced by the leadership of the rebel group.
An American official said a negotiated end to Moro rebellion would create a "less hospitable environment" for training of international terrorists.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Terrorist Groups In the Philippines" Moro Islamic Liberation Front Formed in the late 1970's by breakaways from the Moro National Liberation Front, the original separatist group on Mindanao. The splinter group thought the National Liberation Front had become more Marxist than Islamic. The National Liberation Front entered into negotiations with the government and today rules an autonomous region. The leadership of the autonomous region has been widely portrayed as corrupt. The M.I.L.F., which has a large political following and disavows violence, did not condemn the American-led war in Iraq, and says it has no relationship with Al Qaeda. The latter assertion is widely disputed by American and Australian intelligence agencies, as well as by the Philippine government. Abu Sayyaf Founded in the early 1990's as an Islamic fundamentalist group. Abu Sayyaf considered calling itself the Osama bin Laden brigade, but at that time few people knew who Mr. bin Laden was. After its founder, Abdurajak Janjalani, who trained in Afghanistan, was killed by the military in 1998, the group turned to kidnapping, murder and rape, aiming not just at Filipinos but foreigners as well. Its most recent American captives were Martin and Gracia Burnham, missionaries from Kansas. Mr. Burnham was killed during an American rescue operation last year. A joint American-Philippine military exercise, scheduled to begin in June, is aimed at finally defeating Abu Sayyaf. New People's Army The armed forces of the Communist Party of the Philippines has waged a Marxist revolution in the countryside since the late 1960's. The Communist movement peaked during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, nearly self-destructed in the early '90's because of an internal power struggle, but has gained strength in the past eight years as the gap between rich and poor in the Philippines has widened. In spite of its atheistic views, the New People's Army has been accepted into a tactical alliance by the M.I.L.F. (pg. A7) Map of Philippines highlighting San Agustin. (pg. A7)

HEADLINE: Spurious George 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Statehouse reporters almost anywhere like to boast that the capital they cover is, hands down, the most craven, the most corrupt, the most inept. New York, which has a colorful history of official malfeasance and an almost comically pointless Legislature, is no exception. Betsy Kolbert, the astute Albany veteran who covers politics for The New Yorker, undoubtedly spoke for many of her colleagues when she wrote recently, with perverse but unmistakable pride, that "New York has always been something of a pioneer in the field of fiscal mismanagement."
 Some experts, like Robert Kurtter of the Moody's bond rating agency, say New York is indeed almost incomparably bad. Others insist the state just seems that way because it has so much money to mishandle. Either way, the budget potboiler that has just concluded in Albany is worthy of your indignant attention. It has a lot to say about what a truly sorry state our states are in, and how they got that way. It is interesting, too, because Gov. George Pataki, who would not object to being elected president one day, has handled the mess in a way that raises doubts about both his executive abilities and his political acumen. 
 In their current time of trial, most states portray themselves as victims -- victims of a parlous national economy, of soaring health costs and of costly new state obligations imposed by the federal government, like President Bush's mandatory school testing and homeland protection measures. This is all quite true, but it is far from the whole truth.
The other part of the truth is that many states have done considerable digging of their own graves. And it is not just that they have spent themselves into the red, as conservative critics would have you believe. According to numbers crunched by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, state spending during the boom years of the late 90's grew more slowly (2.4 percent, plus inflation) than the average over the past five decades. Ninety percent of that added spending went to health care, education and crime-fighting. The study can't tell you whether the money was wisely spent, or whether some cutting might have been in order, but the money went for things voters tend to say they want more of. It's no accident that virtually every governor elected in the 1990's promised to be theEducation Governor.
What is often overlooked is that many governors chose to share the windfall by cutting taxes. Altogether, the states collected $40 billion less in taxes this year, thanks to cuts they enacted during those boom years. Supply-siders say this is O.K. because tax cuts stimulate the economy in a way government spending does not. To my mind that's more an article of faith than of economics. But the fact is, whether the states binged on kindergarten classrooms or lower income tax rates, red ink is red ink. Moreover, almost everyone agrees that it is politically more perilous to take back a tax cut than to cut spending.
When the troubles began to hit hard last year, some states made tough choices, but many did not. Most went into what Edmund McMahon of the Manhattan Institute calls "Micawber mode" -- adopting stopgap measures and assuring themselves, like the Dickens character, that something would eventually turn up. The something they decided to count on is a big economic recovery, which just about every trustworthy economist believes will be too little and too late to save them. So they have bought time by raiding the reserves, or raising campground fees or selling office buildings and leasing them back. They have kicked problems down to local government, forcing them to raise property taxes or shorten school years.
And they have borrowed. The mythology that states are more fiscally prudent than the federal government rests on the fact that 49 states (all but Vermont) are required by law to balance their budgets. But they commonly get around this by floating bonds. This season's big borrowing fad is "tobacco bonds," in which states will sell you a share in the money they expect to get someday from the gigantic legal shakedown of Big Tobacco.
This, by the way, is part of a general surge in state dependency on sin taxes to tide them over when times get tough. In all the merry cackling over Morality Czar William Bennett's private hypocrisy as a slot-aholic, I didn't read much about the public hypocrisy of preachy politicians, in both parties, making our states more and more invested in liquor sales, tobacco taxes and gambling revenues. But I digress.
Mr. Pataki came into office in 1994 as a liberal on social issues (except the death penalty), but an ardent tax-cutter. For the first couple of years he cut taxes and controlled spending, as promised. Then the Wall Street bonanza arrived. At that point, he became not a tax-and-spend liberal but something arguably worse, a don't-tax-and-spend-anyway conservative.
New York was not the only state to take a joy ride through the late 90's. Here are a few things that made Mr. Pataki special:
First, throughout this period of too-good-to-last prosperity, Mr. Pataki (abetted by the only two other people who matter in Albany, the Assembly's Democratic leader, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate's Republican leader, Joseph Bruno) not only continued cutting taxes, but also spent money with a fire hose, and he borrowed like a junkie. New York is the most heavily indebted state in the country, and the boom was a great opportunity to pay down some of that debt. Instead, Mr. Pataki borrowed $10 billion more during his first two terms, and now proposes another $4.2 billion in tobacco bonds -- plus rolling over leftover debt going back as far as the 1970's. Historically when states borrow, the money goes to build roads or prisons. In New York, much of it is paying for routine operating expenses. For reasons too complicated to explain, this is not illegal, but it isn't something that inspiresconfidence in our state's fiscal caretakers.
Second, although everyone who glanced at a newspaper knew by late 2001 that the bubble was bursting, Mr. Pataki went into full denial. He was running for re-election, and there was no problem. True, candidates of both parties in several states (Michigan, Florida, Texas, even the visibly tottering California) also pretended things were not so bad. But Mr. Pataki had more reason than most to be on top of things. This state, more than just about any other, lives off income taxes from the well-to-do, which means it lives and dies with Wall Street. New York officials monitor the markets like hawks. The Republican mayors of New York, first Rudolph Giuliani and then Michael Bloomberg, were judiciously piling up sandbags and issuing storm warnings while Mr. Pataki was still singing of blue skies ahead.
Third, when the election was over and the budget crisis was undeniable, rather than biting the bullet, Mr. Pataki scarcely nibbled. Striking a heroic pose against "job-killing taxes," he sent the Legislature a take-it-or-leave-it budget that, leaving aside the smoke and mirrors, was all spending cuts. These were not hard-won, negotiated cuts, but politically indigestible cuts in school aid that he must have known legislators could not swallow, especially when parents are clamoring for smaller classes. The Legislature, herded into revolt by its leaders, sent back a budget that raised sales and income taxes, and then, to universal astonishment, overrode the governor's vetoes. The Legislature's budget contains its share of flimflam, but by comparison with Mr. Pataki's it is an act of courage and fiscal probity. Thus if New York muddles through this crisis, it will have succeeded over Mr. Pataki's loud protests.
You hear two popular theories in Albany to explain why Mr. Pataki lost control of his state this month in its moment of crisis. One is that Mr. Pataki only cared about showing off his antitax bona fides in anticipation of an audition for national office. The other theory is third-termitis. Several people I talked to pointed out that Mr. Pataki had gradually lost much of his first-string staff (including his rigorously conservative first-term budget director) and is himself showing signs of being bored. Both theories are probably correct, but there is an additional factor: Pataki fatigue.
The governor who is now declaiming the virtue of fiscal responsibility is the same governor who was running around handing out checks last year as the economy crumpled around him. That may be why Mr. Bruno, the Senate's Republican leader, did not hesitate to organize a coup. "The critical thing about the governor is that nobody believes him," one Republican budget expert said. "The man has no philosophical anchor." The only thing deeper in the red than the state's future, it seems, is Mr. Pataki's credibility.

HEADLINE: Governors Cite Progress on a Medicaid Plan 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30 

 BODY:
A bipartisan team of governors appeared to make progress this week toward agreement on a comprehensive plan to revamp Medicaid. But powerful Democrats in Congress immediately urged Democratic governors to reject the deal, saying it would hurt poor people.
 Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, a Democrat, said tonight: "We've made some progress. There's quite a ways to go." 
 Medicaid, the nation's largest public health insurance program, provides coverage to 50 million low-income people. It is financed by the federal government and the states. 
Under a proposal drafted by Governor. Vilsack and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican, states would accept some limits on the growth of federal Medicaid spending in return for sweeping new power to alter benefits and eligibility.
Governors say they need the new power so they can avoid wholesale cuts in Medicaid, at a time when Medicaid costs are growing much faster than state revenues.
The proposal discussed this week by the governors builds on a plan announced by the Bush administration on Jan. 31. But in a telephone interview today, Mr. Vilsack said that his plan was "substantially different from the president's proposal."
Governors of both parties resisted the president's original proposal to set firm limits on federal Medicaid spending in each state over the next decade. The Bush administration then challenged the governors to come up with an alternative.
Under Governor Vilsack's proposal, the federal government would offer each state a fixed annual allotment of federal money for about one-third of its Medicaid recipients. 
Critics described the allotments as block grants. But the amounts could be increased to cover unexpected costs that result from increases in unemployment, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or the development of expensive new medical technology. 
In a conference call on Wednesday, the team of 10 governors neared a consensus supporting many elements of the Vilsack-Bush proposal. 
Kevin Goldsmith, director of the Washington office for Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat who is chairman of the National Governors Association, said, "We are moving toward a consensus proposal within the next couple of weeks." 
Bush administration officials welcomed the progress by the team of governors, headed by Mr. Patton and Gov. Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, a Republican.
But when Democrats on Capitol Hill learned the details, they immediately mobilized opposition.
Governor Vilsack said he received a call today from Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, expressing grave reservations. Mr. Waxman, an architect of the Medicaid program, has written many laws adding benefits and expanding eligibility in the last 20 years.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, also called governors with concerns.
"Weakening Medicaid with a block grant is an absolute nonstarter with Senate Democrats," an aide to Mr. Daschle said.
Senator Kennedy said, "Adoption of any version of the administration's block grant proposal is unacceptable."
Consumer groups, including Families USA and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, also denounced the plan being developed by the governors. 
The critics generally oppose any caps on federal Medicaid spending. Moreover, they say, the governors' proposal would limit financial risks to the states but would not limit costs to beneficiaries.
Gov. Bob Holden of Missouri, a Democrat on the panel, said he shared some of the critics' concerns.
"I cannot in good conscience support a Medicaid reform proposal that does not include adequate protections for the population we serve," Governor Holden said.
Another Democrat on the panel, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, said he feared that some governors would cut "optional benefits" like prescription drug coverage, home care and rehabilitation services for people with disabilities.
