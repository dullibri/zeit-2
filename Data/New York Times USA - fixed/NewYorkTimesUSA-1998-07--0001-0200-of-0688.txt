HEADLINE: Confidence Index At 29-Year High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the economy rose in June to a 29-year high, as Americans remained optimistic that the strong labor market and healthy economic growth will continue in coming months.
The Conference Board, a private research group, reported that its index of consumer confidence rose to 137.6 in June from a revised 136.3 in May, a larger rise than Wall Street analysts had expected. 
 June's gain pushed the index above the 29-year high of 137.4 set in February. The last time it was higher was the 137.9 reached in June 1969.
Consumer sentiment is important because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.
The report comes as economists scour new data for signs pointing to the direction of the economy and any inflationary pressures and as Federal Reserve inflation fighters begin two days of meetings in Washington to review interest rate policy.
The Federal Reserve was not expected to raise interest rates at this week's meeting to cool economic growth, especially because of fears that such action would deepen Asia's already serious financial problems.

HEADLINE: Fed Extends Alert on Bank Lending Standards

BYLINE: Bridge News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve warned banks today to keep up their lending standards as the boom in the economy will not last forever.
"This is a critical time for banks to maintain their lending discipline," the Fed said. "Banks should resist any tendency to assume in evaluating credits that the unusually favorable economic environment of the last few years will continue indefinitely." 
 Officials at the Fed and other bank supervisory agencies have urged the banking industry several times before to guard against excessive easing of lending standards. But the Fed letter sent today to all commercial banks takes the warnings a step further, providing a detailed review of lending trends and a heavy emphasis on "forward-looking analysis" of economic conditions.
The Fed identified three specific areas that need special attention: lending to real estate investment trusts, the use of forward-looking analysis in the loan approval process, and the relationship between loan pricing and risk.
Underlying the Fed's warning is the memory of the bank and savings and loan crisis of the late 1980's, after many banks had concentrated so heavily on real estate loans.
Previous warnings have been based mainly on anecdotal evidence and surveys, but the letter today was based on an intensive study of commercial and industrial loans made by a select group of large banks.
The study compared several hundred loans made in late 1995 with loans made in late 1997 and found that "intense competition" had led to "significant easing of pricing and some nonprice terms."
Although the Fed found no evidence that the quality of loans declined during the two-year period, it concluded that this would not have been the case if economic conditions had not been so favorable. The Fed therefore strongly urged bankers to consider what might happen to their loan portfolios during "periods of possible economic adversity."
Only 20 to 30 percent of the loan documents reviewed by Fed staff members contained formal projections of a borrower's future performance, the Fed said, and an even lower percentage contained an analysis of possible "downside" outlooks.

HEADLINE: A Race for the Soul of the Suburbs

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: OLATHE, Kan., June 27

 BODY:
For all the images of Dorothy's farm, the rail lines of Topeka or the aerospace plants of Wichita, the typical Republican voter of Kansas lives here in the traffic-jammed mallscape of suburban Johnson County.
Once the corn-covered Back Forty of metropolitan Kansas City, this affluent area booming with new subdivisions and retail centers has become the state's political quintessence, at least for Republicans, producing far more votes than even Wichita. And it is these newer, distant suburbs that are now a crucial battleground in the Republican primary for governor, between the incumbent, Bill Graves, a social moderate, and David Miller, former Republican state chairman and the leader of Kansas's anti-abortion forces. 
 Among Republicans nationally, the fight is the latest in the party's long and bitter struggle to define its chief mission: balancing budgets or saving souls.
Governor Graves, who has cut taxes four times since taking office three and a half years ago and presided over the kind of prosperous economy seen across most of America in recent years, would scarcely seem likely to face a challenge from his own ranks. He enjoys a 75 percent approval rating, according to one recent poll, and most political analysts say he will be tough to beat come the day of the primary, Aug. 4.
But Mr. Miller, a former state legislator who stepped down as party chairman to run for governor, believes that Mr. Graves's support for abortion rights makes him vulnerable. And while early polls give the Governor a big lead, analysts caution against discounting Mr. Miller, a former leader of the Christian Coalition who can draw on the organizational strength of evangelical churches and anti-abortion groups.
"You wouldn't think that the most popular governor in memory would be challenged by a leader of his own party," said Burdette Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas, who noted that Mr. Graves won 102 of 105 counties in 1994. "But David Miller is a very good politician. He's not in this unless he thinks he can win. He can get out all the evangelicals to vote. It's all going to hinge on turnout."
The outcome, Professor Loomis said, could well depend on voters in suburban communities like Olathe. Disputing the notion that prosperous suburbanites shun the appeals of religious conservatives, he said:
"You go into a lot of these affluent subdivisions -- $200,000 earth-tone houses with three-car garages -- and you'll find that many of these young families are strong fundamentalists. It's not like these people wear a big X on their forehead. They look like a bunch of other well-off, mostly white people."
Indeed, Professor Loomis said, religious conservatives in highest proportions can be found in the newer suburbs, with their winding roads into uniform subdivisions and their isolated cul-de-sacs.
So commanding is the early lead of the 45-year-old Governor Graves, a native of Salina in rural central Kansas, that a poll published on June 21 by The Wichita Eagle found two-thirds of the state's Republican voters supporting him. But low turnout makes primary elections difficult to predict, and surveys have sometimes underestimated the strength of evangelical voters like Cathy Kinsella, who runs a business with her husband, has five children and, as a strong opponent of abortion, says she will be working hard for Mr. Graves's defeat. That the Governor has signed a bill outlawing the late-term procedure that opponents call partial birth abortion does not change Mrs. Kinsella's view.
"He has neglected people like me," she said as she pushed a cart across the lot of an Olathe shopping mall on a wilting recent afternoon. "He's ignored the family, the Bible, the moral issues that are the most important thing facing us."
Mr. Miller, a 48-year-old insurance salesman from Eudora, just west of Olathe, recently held a campaign rally near Wichita that featured the endorsement of James C. Dobson, head of the conservative Focus on the Family, which reaches 28 million people through its radio and television broadcasts. Between prayers and patriotic music, Mr. Dobson stood before a giant American flag and hailed Mr. Miller as "a man of courage, a man of conviction and a man of faith." He criticized Governor Graves, calling him "not pro-life, not pro-family and not conservative."
But Mr. Dobson has campaigned for several social conservatives this year and has not been uniformly successful. His horse in the race for the Republican nomination for Nebraska governor, United States Representative Jon Christensen, finished a distant third.
Yes, Kansas is perhaps the most conservative Midwestern state -- its entire six-member Congressional delegation, including the former track star Jim Ryun, comes from the right end of the Republican spectrum -- but analysts say the rosy economy and the personal appeal of Mr. Graves should translate into bipartisan support. Tom Sawyer, minority leader of the Kansas House, looks like a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination, and among the Democrats who choose to vote in the Republican primary, the Governor is expected to find strong backing.
One of those Democrats, Charlie Bitts, said that while no one could ignore social problems like out-of-wedlock births and drug addiction, he would vote his pocketbook: for Governor Graves.
"Our economy is awfully good right now," said Mr. Bitts, 63, a retired landscaper from rural southeast Kansas. "Our morality in this country certainly needs to be changed. I just don't think politics is the place for it."

HEADLINE: Glimpses of Change in China

 BODY:
President Clinton's trip to China has given Americans an extended look at political life in that complex and changing country. Some of what they have witnessed was predictable, including the Chinese Government's effort to clear outspoken dissidents from Mr. Clinton's path. But a good deal was not, like the uncensored broadcast in China of Mr. Clinton's news conference with President Jiang Zemin. The signs of unexpected openness may be the most encouraging development of the Clinton visit.
Whether the change is a temporary relaxation or a harbinger of greater freedom is not clear. China for the most part remains a repressive dictatorship. But modest liberalizing changes have been under way for much of the last year. They seem to reflect the growing confidence and power of Mr. Jiang. 
 Officially, Mr. Jiang has been China's top leader for the past nine years. But it was only after the death of Deng Xiaoping last year that he defined his own positions, endorsing accelerated privatization of industry, banking reform and slightly freer political debate. Mr. Jiang took another step last weekend by debating some of the most sensitive issues in Chinese politics with Mr. Clinton on live television, including the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 and Beijing's policies toward Tibet.
Mr. Jiang's words conveyed important nuances to Chinese listeners. His characterization of Tiananmen as a "political disturbance" departed from the official line that it was a "counter-revolutionary riot." He also offered a dialogue, with conditions, to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader. These words may be taken as a license to broader public debate on both subjects.
Mr. Clinton has also encountered less encouraging attitudes. The nationalistic tone of questions asked by students at Beijing University, China's traditional democratic hothouse, was disheartening. It suggested that heavy government pressure directed against students and faculty there since the Tiananmen repression had changed the intellectual climate.
Ordinary Chinese, however, are somewhat freer today to express political views in private, and freedom can become contagious. Mr. Jiang seems to understand that a society organized around money-making is harder to regiment than one organized around the nostrums of Chairman Mao. Despite censorship and other government restrictions, exposure to global commerce, television and the Internet are chipping away at the old restraints.
As China continues to modernize its economy, it will face new pressures from within and without to open up its political system as well. Mr. Clinton has repeatedly used his public appearances on this trip to point out the connection between economic and political freedom. Millions of Chinese have been listening attentively.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Fierce Run on the Rand by Speculators Shocks South Africa

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 30

 BODY:
Speculators have given the South African rand a nasty shock in the last few days, forcing the nation's central bank to enlist help from the United States and Britain and to raise interest rates sharply to stem the currency's fall.
Until the selloff began, the rand had been drifting slowly down against the dollar, slipping about 12 percent since the beginning of the year. Then, starting last week, it plunged 13 percent after speculators who had been exploiting the turmoil in Asia turned their sights on South Africa. 
 At the Government's request, the American Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England both intervened on Friday and Monday.
The lift for the rand was short-lived, however, after it became clear that the two central banks were using the South African Reserve Bank's dollars to buy the South African currency.
Facing its worst currency crisis in years, the Reserve Bank today increased its overnight lending rate to commercial banks to more than 20 percent, from 18.311 percent, prompting most banks to raise their prime rates by two percentage points, to 22.25 percent.
While the tighter credit risked slowing South Africa's economic growth, which has already been hurt by falling commodity prices, it bolstered the rand by making rand-denominated assets more attractive to international investors. The currency closed here today at 17.04 cents, up from an all-time low of 16.26 cents at midday on Monday.
Until last week, the rand had actually outperformed the currencies of Asia, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand with which it is often compared because of similarities in the countries' economies.
"But some speculator must have noticed that on his computer and decided that it was our turn," said Sampie Terreblanche, a professor of political economy at Stellenbosch University. "So the Asian bug hit us -- a little belatedly."
Economists universally expressed surprise at the fierceness of the attack because the South African economy's fundamentals are strong, whether compared with Asian economies or with the situation here before the 1994 elections.
South African banks are very conservative, carry few bad loans and are not in thrall to ruling families like the Suhartos in Indonesia.
Foreign debt is low. State assets are being privatized, albeit slowly. Until the run began, inflation was down significantly, to 5 percent, the Reserve Bank had reserves equal to three months' imports, and the prime rate was high but stable at about 18 percent. Foreign bankers generally applaud the Government's economic policies, which focus on beating inflation and lowering the budget deficit.
By contrast, before 1994, the African National Congress was strongly socialist and talked about nationalizing the mines and cutting unemployment with huge public spending; the budget deficit was at 5 percent of G.D.P. and foreign exchange was heavily restricted.
It is not clear what started this run on the rand. Chris Stals, the governor of the Reserve Bank, has blamed selling by an unidentified American hedge fund. But the background was in place. To drive off speculators, the Reserve Bank had steadily raised the overnight lending rate to nearly 24 percent. When it felt confident enough to lower it to 17 percent to let commercial lending rates relax a little, speculators leaped in.
Simultaneously, foreign analysts wrote some cautionary reports. Particularly alarming, said Kevin Lings, senior economist for Nedcor, a major bank holding company, was one from the Bank of New York that raised the possibility of riots and food shortages. Local economists scoffed at the report, since the first affected by a weak rand are the rich, but it presumably encouraged speculators. Another rumor making the rounds had it that the failure of a Reserve Bank clerk to leave overnight orders with a bank in New York was read as a decision by the bank not to defend the rand.
In a sense, the monetary crisis reflects the growing maturity of the South African economy. The last abrupt currency plunge, in 1996, was brought on by a false rumor that President Nelson Mandela had had a heart attack. Administration officials then cried racism, since the implication was that a black government couldn't keep the country together without Mr. Mandela at the helm.
Now, the markets seem content with the prospect that Thabo Mbeki will become president next year and confident that the African National Congress will continue to pursue conservative financial policies. Indeed, economists say, the rand's latest slide results less from political upheaval than from the mundane realities of a developing country, notably South Africa's exposure to the fallout from Asia and its vulnerability to currency speculators. In addition, investors have become increasingly nervous about the possibility that labor unions will put pressure on the Government to temper its economic austerity measures as the 1999 elections approach.
Because of apartheid-era sanctions, South Africa is somewhat insulated against currency crises. Snubbed by the world, it became self-sufficient in food, steel, chemicals, textiles and other basics. It once produced a third of its own gasoline from coal; that is down to 10 percent, but fuel prices are still relatively low. Its biggest imports are auto parts, computers and machinery.
The people immediately hit hardest -- and complaining loudest -- are the relatively small numbers of upper-middle-class and rich people who buy imported clothes and take vacations abroad. However, anyone with a variable-rate mortgage or car loan will soon be hurt, too, if interest rates stay high, and so will the many stores that sell to the poor on credit.
The poor should not be hurt until high interest rates slow the economy enough to cause more layoffs. That is already a problem -- the economy lost about 130,000 jobs last year while growing only 1.7 percent.
On the other hand, a weak rand could stimulate the moribund economy.
The rand is now "clearly significantly undervalued by any measure," said Nico Czypionka, chief economist for the Standard Bank here. All the country's exports, from gold, platinum, manganese and zinc to chemicals, paper pulp, fruit and wine, should benefit. Gold mines, which have been laying off thousands of workers because gold is below $300 an ounce, may become profitable again, because those workers are paid in rand.
The most important thing for the economy, economists say, is to get South Africans to save. They have one of the world's lowest savings rates.
When the rand was created in 1962, it was pegged at two rands to an English pound, back when the pound was worth about $5 -- giving the rand a value then of $2.50. On Monday, it briefly hit 10 rands per pound.
"When I studied in the United States in the late 1960's, I got $1.40 for my rand," Professor Terreblanche said. "Now it's 16 cents. It's hard to think we can be so degraded internationally."

HEADLINE: Pleading a Case for the Child;
Educator Stresses Developmental Needs Over Methods

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
To this day, the winnowing process from his own youth still gnaws at him: how he was able to make it, while so many equally intelligent peers who grew up in less nurturing environments could not.
That memory informed the educational model that made James Comer one of the most celebrated innovators of his time: his approach begins and ends with the notion that, rather than intelligence and will, the experiences children have growing up, good and bad, determine who wins and loses in school and life. 
 In many ways, this should be James Comer's moment, with education near the top of the national agenda and an administration in the White House passionately committed to his view of it. He is a hero to many education advocates, not the least of them Hillary Rodham Clinton, who introduced him at a recent tribute and symposium at the Yale Medical School. They were there to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his School Development Program, a nonprofit project of the Child Study Center at the Yale Medical School that advises schools on the use of his theories.
But at 63, Dr. Comer (pronounced KOH-mer) finds himself not so much a symbol of how education has changed as a marker of where the fault lines are drawn. He is one of the most consistent critics of the ascendant countermodels for school reform: tougher standards, high-stakes tests and experiments with privatization or vouchers. For all the success of his approach, which is used in more than 450 schools in 17 states and several foreign countries, Dr. Comer is at least as aware of the winds blowing away from him as the ones wafting in his direction.
"In many ways, my voice has been heard, and I have had some influence," he said, reflecting on his career at his office at the Yale Medical School, where he is associate dean and a professor of child psychiatry. "But in the one area that's most critical, the role of child development, people are still not paying attention. Our moment is going to come, but right now most of the attention seems to be on things like charters and vouchers that don't do anything for the vast majority of children."
Few educators have looked so hard and so long at how the lives of children relate to educational achievement.
"Before it was a major field of study, Dr. Comer recognized that learning in school, before school and after school is tied to a child's level of development," Mrs. Clinton said in her remarks. "Before charter schools or magnet schools became household words, Dr. Comer was busy designing schools in which parents were involved in everything from curricular development to social activities."
Dr. Comer's education model centers on the idea that many children, minority-group children in particular, struggle in school because their level of social, intellectual and cultural development is far behind that of more affluent students.
Schools, he says, must focus on developmental needs, or even the best teachers and most sophisticated curriculum will be ineffective. That means bringing counselors, psychologists, parents and others into the learning process -- rather than just depending on teachers -- and tailoring lessons to a child's background.
For example, at Isadore Wexler Community School in inner-city New Haven, one school Dr. Comer works with, Shelia Brantley incorporates child development into her third-grade reading curriculum. Thus, the program is not just about reading. It might include a trip to the supermarket so students who have never seen an avocado can learn what the word means, a lesson suburban children might not need.
Discussions are predicated on the children's learning to communicate complex thoughts and ideas they might not be exposed to at home. And the whole teaching and learning experience is based on social skills -- listening, sharing information, expressing clear points of view -- that transcend the individual lesson.
The schools Dr. Comer works with are organized around three principles: problem solving rather than blaming; consensus decision-making, and collaboration.
Much of it sounds uncontroversial. But Dr. Comer's program begins with the unfashionable idea that in a country of growing disparities between haves and have nots, education has to begin by addressing the disparate needs and backgrounds of children so they can learn.
"Even my friends in education still begin by talking curriculum and instruction," he said. "All those things are important, but where's the kid? What's the kid like? What's going on with the kid? All of American education has left the development of the child out of it. We may pay it lip service, but for a whole number of reasons, the needs of the kid get ignored."
His perspective in many ways goes against the ingrained American belief that each individual can determine his or her own destiny.
"My biggest problem with education is we see learning as a function of intelligence and will," he said. "If you have the intelligence and will, you will learn. If you don't, you won't. Well, it's not that simple."
To critics, particularly advocates of vouchers, charter schools and tougher standards and tests, Dr. Comer's agenda, while well meaning, is not systematic enough to create real change in schools.
"He has a soft kind of model that's very Clintonesque," said Chester Finn, a prominent education analyst and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. "It says things a lot of educators find appealing, but I'm not persuaded that it can be counted on to produce improved student achievement. It doesn't change the power. It doesn't change the control of resources.
"It doesn't change the ground rules. It doesn't change who's in charge. It doesn't change what we mean by a public school, and it doesn't have the combination of uniform standards, tests and consequences I believe you need for real change."
He added that there were approaches other than Dr. Comer's richly empathetic model to help inner-city students. He cited the ideas of Thaddeus Lott, a Houston principal recently profiled in Policy Review magazine who uses ability grouping, intensive drill, rote learning and other traditional teaching methods to extraordinary result at his Wesley Elementary School.
Dr. Comer is singularly unimpressed by most of the ideas advocated by Dr. Finn and others. Unlike some educators, who see charter schools as a way to develop distinctive, innovative schools, he sees them as little different from voucher proposals that he thinks would skim off the best students, leaving most to fester in schools that have been largely written off.
Dr. Comer likes to cite his life story as a microcosm of his view of education. His mother grew up poor in Mississippi, with little formal schooling but a passionate belief in the importance of education. His father, a steel mill laborer, grew up in rural Alabama with a sixth-grade education. Their five children went on to earn 13 bachelor's and graduate degrees between them.
Dr. Comer grew up in East Chicago, Ind., in an integrated neighborhood with integrated schools. He may have been poorer than some of his white classmates, but his parents were able to inculcate the values, attitudes and discipline that he believes allowed him to succeed.
It taught him two lessons. The first was that education was the key to success and it was open to everyone. The second was that influences on children mean more for their chances of success than does innate intelligence.
Dr. Comer received his undergraduate degree from Indiana University and his medical degree from Howard University. But his work with poor communities soon convinced him he could have the most impact by working with schools.
Like proponents of most reform models, he can provide research showing dramatic results, like the McLeansville Middle School in Guilford County, N.C., where the percentage of eighth graders reading at a competent level rose from 65 to 85 between 1993 and 1997.
But he says that of the schools he has worked with, only a third had dramatic results, a third showed modest gains and a third were little changed.
But all in all, he says, those are pretty good results.
"If you play baseball those results will put you in the Hall of Fame, and this game's tougher than baseball," he said. "You're working against the very undesirable condition of the society: racism, economic adversity, social marginalization, the effects on parents and teachers of dealing with kids who people believe have no future. That's what schools serving low-income and minority kids are always up against. You bat .333 against that, and you feel pretty good."
Dr. Comer has handed off much of the daily operation of the program to others, like the executive director, Edward T. Joyner. But he is not slowing down. He continues to expand his activities.
He now works with districts as well as individual schools. He has joined Project Atlas, a new effort in which a consortium of theorists advises schools on a range of issues. The consultants are Dr. Comer; Theodore Sizer, the retired head of the Coalition for Essential Schools; Howard Gardner, the Harvard education theorist, and Janet Whitlaw of the Education Development Center.
The four theorists' approaches include Dr. Comer's ideas on how to draw diverse influences into a school's daily life; Dr. Gardner's on tests and student assessments; Dr. Sizer's on learning and curriculum, and Ms. Whitlaw's on teacher preparation.
Dr. Comer began his work with the idea that education reform was a long, slow struggle. Nothing has led him to think otherwise.
"The mentality of the moment is to look for the quick fix," he said. "But if we try to gloss over the depth, severity and difficulty of the problems, we will never address the depth, severity and difficulty of the problems."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS -- The Balloon That Refuses To Be Popped;
Investors Keep Lifting Stocks Despite Warnings

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The warnings that the bubble is about to burst have been sounded each quarter for the last few years, but investors in the stock market continue to ignore them. And so far, despite a series of blows lately that were widely expected to take the air out of the balloon, they have been right.
Sure, the Asian economic crisis poses a threat to already slowing corporate profit growth at home. And yes, the recent rise in wages could eventually mean a revival of serious inflation. Yet all indications are that the American economy is remarkably sound, seemingly indestructible, and therefore, investors surmise, so is Wall Street. 
 That's why, midway through 1998, share prices are once again hovering near their all-time highs. The investing public, for all the complaints of the professionals, remains sanguine about the unheard-of riches being delivered by one of the greatest bull markets in history.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- a widely followed proxy for the larger stock market and millions of index-fund investors -- is up nearly 17 percent this year. The Dow Jones industrial average, the best-known market barometer, is up 13 percent in a year that many Wall Street pros had forecast full-year gains of less than 8 percent.
"We've had a year well above almost anyone's expectations," said Frederick B. Taylor, the chief investment officer at the U.S. Trust Company.
Even though share prices fell modestly yesterday, and finished the second quarter with only slim gains of about 2.9 percent for the S.& P. 500, the evidence suggests that investors have not yet cooled to stocks.
Of course, there are dire warnings that weaker profits later in the year could send investors fleeing and erase most of the gains. Or that Asia, already in recession and still on the edge of destruction, could swipe winnings in Europe and topple American markets.
But for now, the United States economy seems to be in the throes of what the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has called a "virtuous cycle," of powerful growth, little if any inflation, low unemployment and rising wage gains.
That's an almost ideal economic scenario that may be compensating for the gradual slowdown in profit growth, which has drifted down for large companies to a gain of just 3.8 percent in the first quarter compared with a 15 percent advance in the period a year earlier.
This combination of favorable economic factors has been critical to the market's surge, said Mr. Taylor at U.S. Trust. Unemployment, inflation and interest rates are all low, consumer confidence is high, and where Federal budget deficits reigned, now there are surpluses.
"There are a whole group of things that if you had forecast them a few years ago, no one would have believed it," he said. "As an American looking at the U.S. economy these are indeed good times."
And with soaring consumer confidence, Americans are rushing to buy their favorite products -- no less than the shares of companies that create and market those products.
Call investors defiant, narrow-minded, excessively bullish, naive, or even downright silly. But also call them rich -- billions, no trillions, richer with each passing quarter. The "virtuous cycle," for them, is about buying Gap khakis, and then buying into shares of the Gap and its retail brethren.
Indeed, for those counting, the current bull market, which dates back to October 1990, just before the gulf war, clocked day 2,819 yesterday -- making it the third-longest bull market in history. It is now just months away from passing the period that ended disastrously in October 1929.
Not even the audacious 1980's can match the run of the 1990's for durability or distance. In the 1980's, the Dow soared 250 percent to its August 1987 high, before tumbling 22.3 percent on Oct. 19, 1987 -- Black Monday. In the 1990's, however, the Dow has climbed about 280 percent, including a record three consecutive years with gains of 20 percent or more. (In the 1920's, the Dow gained 496 percent before plummeting into the Great Depression.)
But if there is anything to raise a warning flag about the sustainability of the remarkable stock market run of the last few years, it is that the winnings are being concentrated in an ever-smaller group of blue-chip companies that include well-known names like General Electric, Dell Computer, Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart.
Lately, Americans, along with a growing mass of foreigners, have placed their bets largely on companies like Dell Computer, one of the hottest stocks of the decade. And despite its rocket-like rise, Dell has gained another 121 percent this year, pushing its market value to $58 billion -- more than that of the General Motors Corporation.
Many companies seem protected against even dire attacks by something resembling a bullet-proof vest. Microsoft, despite the antitrust action by the Federal Government and at least 20 states, has seen its shares appreciate another 67 percent in 1998, pushing its value up $110 billion in just the last six months to $267 billion, second only to General Electric, which is worth almost $300 billion.
The market value of corporations -- or what investors value them at -- has been growing exponentially in the 1990's, along with the urge to merge.
And when corporations merge, or hint at such deals, share prices soar, feeding the great bull market. Financial deals, like Citicorp's agreement to merge with the Travelers Group for $70 billion, have been among the most lucrative.
Some analysts see the merger deals not so much as a sign of health, but as a symbol of a market that is peaking, and readying for a fall. They argue that companies running out of ways to increase profits have nothing better to do than seek partnerships as a way to keep the game going just a little bit longer.
Of all the warning signs, the sharpest concerns corporate profits. The first-quarter growth was the slowest since 1991, and the second-quarter estimates are for gains of about 3.5 percent, according to First Call Inc., which tracks earnings data.
A profit slowdown, conventional wisdom goes, would weigh heavily on share prices, and at the very least, stall the bull run.
"Stock prices and profits go together, and through the 1990's, you've had a golden age of profits," said Ronald Talley, an economist at the WEFA Group, a forecasting unit in Eddystone, Pa. "However, it looks like that period may be coming to an end. You can't have profits growing faster than the economy forever, and it seems that unusual situation is about to end."
Gail Dudack, the chief investment strategist at UBS Securities, says the first quarter's strong economic growth with meager profit gains portends a difficult second half of the year. "If you put those two pieces of information together, it suggests you could have a negative quarter later this year," she said.
But others, like Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed market strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, says the "supertanker" economy will continue to steam ahead, buoying the major indexes even if many smaller stocks languish.
Part of the profit picture, though, could be determined by events in Asia, and they do not look good.
Companies like Boeing and Motorola have issued profit warnings, creating a group of losers circling a narrower band of big winners.
Thomas M. Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, estimates that the top 30 companies that make up the S.& P. 500 provided about half of this year's gains, partly because foreign investors consider them safe and recognizable. Many on Wall Street talk about a two-tiered market, a market of haves and have nots.
"The big surprise this year has been the focus and narrowness of the market," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. "Everyone believed that at some point smaller stocks were going to join in and they haven't."
The weaker fortunes of smaller- company issues can be seen in the Russell 2000 index, which has gained just 4.6 percent this year. "It's really been the General Electrics and the Coca-Colas that are getting all the activity," Mr. Birinyi said.
The big losers midway through 1998 are the energy stocks, suffering from a huge decline in the price of oil, as well as semiconductor companies with heavy exposure to Asia. National Semiconductor, an S.& P. 500 stock, is down nearly 50 percent this year. The Rowan Companies, an oil drilling concern, is down 36 percent.
Worries about Asia and profits were said to be behind the anxious moments in the second quarter, when the Dow first soared to a record 9,211.84 in May before falling as low as 8,627.93 earlier in June, a drop of 6.3 percent.
But with each dip has come a resurgence of buying, and that surge sent the S.& P. 500 to a record on Monday, before slipping slightly yesterday. The Nasdaq, despite turbulence in recent weeks, is up 20.7 percent this year. The Dow, meanwhile, closed at 8,952.02 -- hovering around the 9,000 mark.
Could anything end the party? Certainly the Federal Reserve could if it decides to raise interest rates. For the latest on that front, tune in today shortly after 2 P.M. for the conclusion of the Fed's two-day Open Market Committee meeting.

HEADLINE: Donations Rise, Ending United Way Slump

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Reversing years of declining support, United Way of Tri-State will report today that it raised $103 million in the last year, up 4.5 percent over the previous year after adjusting for inflation, the first real increase in this decade.
The growth is the first since United Way of America was rocked by a scandal six years ago that sent its president to prison for stealing charity funds and the local United Ways saw their support drop. Donations have also suffered from downsizing at major corporations, slow wage growth and less interest in giving to health and human services agencies. 
 Even with the increase, contributions by the 137 large companies and their workers in the New York metropolitan region that give through Tri-State is still 15 percent below the 1991-92 figure, when pledges totaled $121.4 million, adjusted for inflation as are all figures reported here.
The increase in pledges should translate into small increases in allocations in the next 12 months to many of the health and human services agencies that depend on United Way for support. Typically about 6 percent of pledges are not fulfilled, often because people switch jobs.
Tri-State is the largest of the 1,300 United Ways, but is little known because it does not directly allocate money to agencies. Instead, Tri-State divides the money it raises among 30 local United Ways in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with 41.5 percent of the money going to United Way of New York City.
Gary Wendt, chairman of the 1997-98 Tri-State campaign, noted that the 4.5 percent increase in pledges is significantly higher than the 3 percent average increase reported so far by 11 other large United Ways across the country. Mr. Wendt said he would like to see an increase in giving by the high-income residents of New York City, including those employed on Wall Street, where bonus checks are booming but giving through the United Way is modest.
At Goldman Sachs, for example, the 190 partners each made a minimum bonus of $4 million last year and 215 managing directors each averaged $1.5 million in bonuses. The investment banking partnership and its employees gave $1.1 million to United Way in the last year, a Goldman Sachs spokesman said, but a total of $60 million to all charitable causes.
Mr. Wendt pointed to one investment bank that was generous, Merrill Lynch, "which had more $10,000 givers than any other company in the country."
Mr. Wendt, the chief executive of G.E. Capital, a financial subsidiary of General Electric Corporation based in Stamford, Conn., set a goal for his company and its employees of $1.35 million, 20 percent above the previous year. Pledges exceeded the goal at $1.43 million.
United Way of New York City is the only large United Way that has not reported its campaign results for the fiscal year that ended yesterday. Ann Ormsby, a vice president, said Monday that pledges were running about 8 percent ahead of the previous year.
The Tri-State results, and the preliminary figures from the New York City campaign, indicate that the federated fund-raising organization is doing much better at winning support here than in the nation's second- and third-largest metropolitan areas. Earlier this month, United Way Inc. in Los Angeles reported pledges of $59 million, up a half of 1 percent over last fiscal year. Giving to the United Way serving Los Angeles County is still 46 percent below its peak seven years ago, when pledges totaled $108.8 million, and has been essentially flat since 1995.
Donors may have been turned off this year by a radio advertising campaign that chided Los Angeles residents for spending money on breast implants and caffe lattes, but not on gifts to United Way.
In Ventura County, a booming area northwest of Los Angeles, allocations to 59 member agencies had to be slashed 30 percent in May because United Way of Ventura County's deficit had grown to $1.2 million. The cuts came on top of a 7.5 percent cut the previous September.
In the third-largest city, the Chicago United Way/Crusade of Mercy raised $95.1 million, up 3 percent from the previous year, but still 22 percent below its $121.8 million peak six years ago.

HEADLINE: They're Ready For Their Layups Now

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 30

 BODY:
In real life, Timothy B. Smith is a "mystery shopper" for Taco Bell, buying chicken incognito at the fast-food joints and reporting to headquarters whether it is cooked too little or served too cold.
This job may have done little to prepare him for his big moment today, but Mr. Smith, 30, had other things going for him. For one, his head was shaved. For two, he had the right answer when the casting director, Julie Ashton, asked him, "Timothy, how tall are you?" 
 Six foot 4, he answered.
"Perfect," Ms. Ashton said.
Mr. Smith became one of a handful of men who may just have a shot at the movie part of a lifetime, the title role in "Michael Jordan: The Untold Story of an American Hero."
This week, television producers have descended on Chicago, hoping that somewhere in this scrappy workingman's town where the six-time National Basketball Association champions, the Bulls, are the municipal religion, they might just find a natural for the part of the world's most famous athlete in a movie to be made this fall and broadcast before the end of the year for the new Fox Family Channel.
"It's unlikely we're going to get the Denzel Washingtons of the world," said Lance H. Robbins, a producer for the channel.
And while actors across the country have been sending in their head shots and bragging on their hook shots, "we haven't seen many professional actors that could play basketball and look like Michael Jordan," Mr. Robbins said. "We've literally had white guys submit reasons why they should play Michael Jordan: 'I may not look like him but I can play him.' "
In Chicago, the producers opened a high school gym on Monday so that Jordan wannabes could show how they looked on a court. Several thousand men, teen-agers and boys showed up, some waiting in line for hours to audition for the boyhood, teen-age and star phases of Jordandom.
"Who wouldn't want to be Jordan?" said Robert Reed, 29, a high school math and science teacher who tried out for the part. Mr. Reed is such a Michael fan that his 5-month-old son's middle name is Jordan.
After the aspiring actors dribbled and took a few shots and read a line in front of a camera, Ms. Ashton selected the 30 or so most promising Jordans for callbacks today.
Michael Parkinson, 27, a firefighter who showed up at the gym after working a 24-hour shift, was one. Today, in an Italian suit with a red silk pocket handkerchief, showing Mr. Jordan's Armani side, Mr. Parkinson sat in a room full of Jordan look-alikes mouthing a scene in which Mr. Jordan, having left basketball for baseball, decides to respect the baseball strike: "I won't cross the strike line, Ron. I'm out of here."
His Airness himself has nothing to do with "The Untold Story." The screenwriter, Michael J. Murray, who has written television movies about the Menendez Brothers and Madonna, has teased a script out of the many books, magazine articles and newspaper stories that have been written about Mr. Jordan.
But "we'd love to have him bless the project," Mr. Robbins said.
The movie will be overwhelmingly favorable, Mr. Robbins said, touching only briefly on his affinity for gambling and a few sensitive scenes, like "the fact that he was very very shy when he was in college, hardly went out on dates, and joined a home economics class and got confidence to interact with women."
Today, Mr. Smith showed he was more than a look-alike, delivering his lines with emotion and nuance and impressing Ms. Ashton well beyond her expectations. "Usually, you're really looking mostly for, like, acting skills," Ms. Ashton said. "But with this project, it's really a look. And basketball skills would be nice too."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: AIRWAVES;
Clinton Enjoys Radio Stint: No Violence, Drugs or Sex

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, June 30

 BODY:
Talk radio is still new in China, so good behavior counts.
Callers are generally polite, not confrontational. A host would never hang up on anybody, the way Howard Stern likes to do. And the idea of trying anything as risque as voicing a contrary political opinion is altogether foreign, though maybe the vigilant screeners just make it seem that way. 
 When President Clinton turned up today at the studio of Shanghai Radio 990 to make his first appearance on a talk radio program outside the United States, he fielded questions about the need for library exchanges, the requirements for joining the World Trade Organization and the benefits of better education.
One caller even asked about auto emissions. The President seemed thrilled.
"One of the things you need to know," Mr. Clinton replied, "is that when a car, an automobile, burns gasoline, about 80 percent of the heat value of the gasoline is lost in the inefficiency of the engine. But they are now developing new engines, called fuel-injection machines, where the fuel goes directly into the engine, and it is about four times more efficient.
"So I hope that within a matter of just a few years, in the U.S., in China and thoughout the world, all these engines will be much much less polluting. And that will be very good for the health of the people of China and for the health of the world environment."
At that, Zuo Anlong, the host of the program, "Citizens and Society," could not resist a segue into mass transportation and, after a sip of Diet Coke, Mr. Clinton was off and running again. Here was a chance to delve deeply into policy without obnoxious hosts to cut in unexpectedly or resort to "gotcha" questions.
There was no mention of sex, violence or drugs. And certainly no allusions to Monica S. Lewinsky. It was an inveterate talker's paradise.
Allowing Mr. Clinton to answer questions from callers on live radio, uncensored, might have seemed unthinkable only a week ago. The media in China are tightly monitored, and broadcasting is generally kept within the narrow confines of approved programming.
After Mr. Clinton spoke about sensitive political topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre and Tibet in a nationally televised news conference on Saturday with President Jiang Zemin, then addressed students at Beijing University on Monday, having him on Shanghai radio reinforced the signals of greater openness in China, at least symbolically.
Yet the reality of today's program illustrated the firm limits that remain on public discourse in this country. As long as the radio station could screen its callers, even Mr. Clinton's presence could not move the discussion past a collection of safe topics.
Here was one typical question, from Li in Shanghai: "As far as getting the Shanghai Library and American libraries going for better and better exchanges, what can we do to increase the amount of exchange and cooperation between them?"
Mr. Clinton's answer was too long to print here, but suffice it to say: start with more Internet use, then we will ask someone at the Library of Congress to follow up.
Another question, from Yu in Shanghai: "As far as promoting cooperation in science and technology between the United States and China, what are you planning to do?"
The President kept it innocuous, citing earthquake prediction and spina bifida research, and then asked that anyone wth an idea write it down and mail it to him. There seemed to be no need to mention nuclear or satellite technology.
There was one question with a little juice.
"You seem very healthy, and you seem to have a very nice figure, Mr. President," said another Li in Shanghai. "When you were in college, which sports did you like to play? That's the first question. The second question I'd like to ask, if you could answer, Mr. President, is how do you maintain your energy in your work? And then the third thing is: can you predict who's going to win the World Cup?"
The short version: he played basketball in college, started jogging later and finally settled on golf. "It's my favorite sport," he said. "Even though it doesn't burn a lot of calories, it makes my mind calm. So I like it."
And then he threw caution to the winds and predicted that Brazil would be "hard to beat" in the world soccer tournament.
Mr. Clinton's host in Shanghai, Mayor Xu Kuangdi, was also in the studio to answer questions and he could almost hold his own with the President, talking at length about auto emissions and the information superhighway.
Then came a question from Wang in Shanghai: "Can you both talk about education exchanges and the future for them between the United States and China?"
Education seemed to be the favorite topic for each man, so they were off like horses, taking turns racing in the lead. Mr. Clinton spoke for several minutes about the need for computer literacy, affordable education and exchange programs, concluding with a typically innocuous "and I think it will only grow more important as we move into the next century."
Mr. Xu came back with a lengthy discussion about the need for Chinese teachers to consider introducing elements of the American teaching system to foster greater individuality.
"In Chinese eduation we talk about the filling of information into the student, whereas in the United States they try to make students more able," Mr. Xu said. "They try to teach you how to have the ability to do things. So Chinese are very good at tests, but not necessarily when it comes to scientific research."
Mr. Clinton rejoined: "Well, actually, here's a case where I think we would greatly benefit from working together, because there is no perfect system. If you just start with the issue of discipline and order in the classroom, it's impossible for learning to occur. We also know that if there is too much order, where everything is structured, the child may close up and not be open to information and to learning. So we have tried all kinds of things.
"Now on the second matter," and he went on for a while longer.
It was only toward the end of the hour that Mr. Clinton found a way to sound his sole note of political imperative, similar to what he said at the news conference with Mr. Jiang and at Beijing University.
"I believe, as I have said repeatedly, that high levels of personal freedom are quite important to the success of a society in the information age," he said, "because you need people who feel free to explore, to state their views, to explore their own convictions and then live out their own dreams, and that this will add to the stability of a society by enriching it. That's what I believe."

Optimism Over Economic Efforts by Japan Bolsters Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar plummeted more than two and a half yen yesterday -- its biggest loss since the United States and Japan sold dollars two weeks ago -- as traders reacted to signs that Japan was making progress to mend its ailing banking industry.
Traders also bought yen after Taku Yamasaki, the policy chief of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said he was considering a permanent tax cut to stimulate economic growth. 
 "People have been clamoring for a permanent tax cut and a deal to bail out the banking system," said Mark Turner, the chief investment officer at the Schooner Asset Management Company in Boston. "It would appear Japan is going to deliver. It's only natural people will review their bearishness on the yen."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 139.16 yen, down from 141.69 late on Monday.
Optimism over Japan's financial industry arose after Okiharu Yasuoka, chairman of a committee working on the bank cleanup, gave Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto an early draft of a program for a decision expected tomorrow. That bolstered expectations the Government was speeding up efforts to lift Japan out of recession. Japan's Government is struggling to shore up a banking system beset by 77 trillion yen, or $555 billion, in problem loans.
Comments by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin also fostered speculation that the United States and Japanese Governments might jointly sell dollars to bolster the yen, as they did earlier this month, analysts said.
"There are a number of bases on which we might judge it proper to intervene" in the future, Mr. Rubin said in Bangkok, Thailand, a stop on his tour of four Asian nations.
The Bank of Japan, along with the United States Treasury and Federal Reserve, sold dollars for yen two weeks ago, shaving six yen off the dollar in a day. The yen's weakness -- which lowers the cost of Japanese exports -- could press Japan's trade rivals to allow their currencies to weaken as well.
The yen also received a boost from a report in the Internet version of the newspaper Yomiuri that said Mr. Yamasaki was considering a permanent income tax cut -- a move Japan's trading partners have urged the Government to make.
In a sign the Japanese economy remains troubled, a report showed yesterday that Japan's unemployment rate in May remained at a record high of 4.1 percent for the second straight month as some of the nation's biggest companies were forced to cut jobs. Other reports showed housing starts in May fell 17 percent from the same month a year earlier, the 17th straight monthly drop.
"If you're looking to buy yen because you think the economy is going to turn around any time soon, you may be sorely disappointed," Mr. Turner of Schooner Asset Management said.

Signs of Slower Growth Lift Treasury Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury bonds climbed yesterday after reports on manufacturing and retail sales suggested that the economy was slowing and that inflation was tame.
"The economy will slow down," said Jeffrey Eglow, who helps manage more than $250 million at Highlander Capital Management in Parsippany, N.J. "We see lower rates" in the weeks and months ahead, he said. 
 The Chicago branch of the National Association of Purchasing Management reported a bigger-than-expected drop in its manufacturing index, to 52.9 in June from 56.3 in May. The group's prices-paid index, a gauge of inflation, also fell. The report helped bonds recover losses suffered after the dollar plunged against the yen.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 yesterday, to 107 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.62 percent, from 5.64 percent on Monday.
Bonds also got a lift after a private report by LJR Redbook Research showed a drop of seven-tenths of 1 percent in retail sales in the month through June 27, compared with figures from the corresponding period in May, and as traders bet that the report on employment in June, to be released tomorrow, may fall short of expectations. Some investors also put cash to work at the end of the quarter to put more high-quality bonds on their books before reporting quarterly results, traders said.
"Some of the gains are quarter-end related," said Mark Sauvigne, a trader at Chase Securities Inc.
Benchmark 30-year bonds handed investors returns of 5.8 percent in the second quarter, when price gains and interest are taken into account. In the first half of the year, Treasury bonds gained 7.2 percent, or $72,000 for each $1 million investment made at the start of the year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Nuclear Arms' Cost Put at $5.48 Trillion

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Nuclear weapons have cost the United States at least $5.48 trillion since 1940, and for most of that time neither Congress, the armed services nor the President had a clear idea what was being spent, according to a four-year study sponsored by the Brookings Institution.
The figure, which is stated in 1996 dollars converted under a Defense Department formula, represents about a third of the nation's military spending and about one-tenth of all expenditures by the Federal Government from 1940 to 1996; only non-nuclear defense programs and Social Security cost more. 
 The money spent on nuclear weapons, plus money for environmental cleanup, would buy 290 million automobiles, says an author of the study, William J. Weida, a professor of economics at Colorado College in Colorado Springs and a former director of the Economic Policy and Analysis division of the Defense Department.
Stephen I. Schwartz, editor of the study, said, "Nuclear weapons were considered to give more 'bang for the buck.' " For that reason, Mr. Schwartz said, policy planners have paid little attention to costs.
The study, "Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Since 1940," was published today by Brookings, a research center in Washington.
The cost of nuclear weapons programs has never been compiled before, according to the study. The cost includes money spent to invent them and produce them, build the missiles, bombers and submarines to deliver them and to defend against enemy nuclear attacks. In addition, cleaning up environmental damage resulting from the production of nuclear weapons will bring the total cost to $5.82 trillion, based on estimates of what will be needed in the next 80 years, the study said.
The Defense Department and the Atomic Energy Commission or its successor, the Department of Energy, were at the center of most of these programs.
Producing nuclear weapons accounted for only about 7 percent of the total cost, the study said. Deploying the weapons, including the cost of missiles and bombers, accounted for 55.7 percent of the total; defending against nuclear attacks made up 16.1 percent; targeting and controlling the weapons made up 14.3 percent and nuclear waste management and cleanup was 6.3 percent.
The study group said one reason for the high costs was interservice rivalry, with the Air Force getting nuclear arms and then the Navy and Army wanting them, too.
The study's authors said strategic deterrence had prevented nuclear conflict and probably conventional conflict in Europe as well. Although they said that task could have been accomplished more cheaply, they did not say how much more cheaply.
Some of the money went for projects that failed, like the development of a nuclear-powered airplane and the deployment of nuclear bombs under the Greenland ice cap. Far more was spent on producing nuclear weapons that the authors say were far in excess of military requirements. Mr. Weida, the economist, said part of the problem was pork barrel politics. Lawmakers were loath to cut back or cancel production of nuclear weapons in plants in their states or districts.
"The tie between regional economic benefits and nuclear weapons," he said, "created an inertia which made it extremely difficult to curtail nuclear weapons programs after their useful life had expired."

HEADLINE: Whitman Cuts $42.8 Million From Budget

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a new $18.1 billion state budget into law tonight, using her line-item veto power to eliminate $42.8 million in legislative spending, as well as language prohibiting her from turning public employee jobs over to private contractors.
The state budget, approved by lawmakers on Monday, raises spending by almost $1 billion for public schools, state colleges and universities, preservation of open spaces, and various other programs. It also puts $700 million aside in a "rainy day fund." 
 Although Governor Whitman and lawmakers had reached agreement on the broad outlines of the new spending plan for the fiscal year, which begins on July 1, she used her line-item veto power to strike some spending increases that were included by lawmakers and some budget language that her aides said would have reduced her authority.
Governor Whitman eliminated the biggest item that legislators had included for property tax relief: a $10 million increase in state aid for municipalities. Whitman aides said that before allocating more municipal aid, the Governor wanted to see what recommendations her commission on property tax reform would make at its meeting next month.
Mrs. Whitman cut other spending increases, including a $6.5 million addition for park maintenance and $6 million that had been added for capital projects at state colleges and universities.
Expressing concern about the rise in the number of "special appropriations" that lawmakers added to the budget this year for various projects in their districts, she warned that groups and organizations receiving the extra aid should not rely on it in the future.
She also eliminated state spending for about a dozen legislative projects, including $300,000 for a proposed Yogi Berra museum on the campus at Montclair State University and $1.5 million for a new Morris County Fire and Police Academy.
Spending for various legislative projects totaled about $60 million in the new state budget, about $20 million more than this year's budget.
"The increase in special appropriations reflects the availability of revenues generated by our robust economy," the Governor said. "During such times, it is appropriate to support worthy causes and to meet unaddressed needs. The recipients of such special appropriations should not, however, become reliant on state support since such support is, by its nature, temporary."
Some of the cuts that Mrs. Whitman made in the new budget were not popular with lawmakers.
State Senator Robert E. Littell, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he was disappointed by many of the changes the Governor made. He had recommended the spending increase in park maintenance and he called Mrs. Whitman's decision to reduce the allocation "very shortsighted," particularly since she was pushing to purchase a million acres of undeveloped land over the coming decade.
"You can't ask people to buy more land when you don't take care of what you have," he said.
Governor Whitman also struck out language that would have prevented the administration from withholding funds to municipalities for development projects, like sewers and roads, that are inconsistent with the state's growth-management plan.
On the issue of privatization of state jobs, she eliminated language that would have prevented the administration from turning any state jobs over to private contractors.
But in a move suggesting that Mrs. Whitman may not use privatization this year, she left $7 million untouched that lawmakers had put back into the budget, the amount her aides estimate privatization would save. The Whitman administration is considering privatizing an estimated 500 jobs in the Department of Transportation's engineering department and the Corrections Department's food service division.
Assemblyman Richard Bagger, a Republican and chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee, said the language had been inserted because lawmakers did not think it was appropriate for state employees to lose their jobs when the economy was pouring so much extra tax revenue into the state's coffers.
State Treasurer James A. DiEleuterio Jr. said that the question of eliminating some state jobs and turning them over to private contractors was still under discussion.
Despite the urging of some lawmakers and Mayor Milton Milan of Camden, Governor Whitman did not change language that authorizes a state-appointed review board to oversee Camden's finances.

Plan Seeks to Clarify Muddled Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
As Nieuw Amsterdam was only 22 blocks in extent, one Dutch colonist could easily find another by suggesting a rendezvous at the market field. Do not try that today.
"If you say, 'I'll meet you at Marketfield and Broad,' even I couldn't get there in 20 minutes," said Carl Weisbrod. And he's the president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. And his office is only a 10-minute walk from tiny Marketfield Street, near Bowling Green. 
 Historic as lower Manhattan's tangled 17th-century street plan may be, it confounds New Yorkers and out-of-towners, leaving them intimidated. The problem is compounded by inadequate signs and insufficient nighttime light.
So the Alliance, which runs the downtown business improvement district, has embarked on a $13.5 million streetscape improvement plan that includes the installation of specially designed "street furniture": simple lampposts, sturdy wastebaskets, benches with spring-loaded seats and a wordless "wayfinding" system.
Wayfinding signs, mounted on poles or at subway stops, will combine one or two pictographs of familiar landmarks -- the Statue of Liberty, World Trade Center, Trinity Church and Brooklyn Bridge among them -- with bold arrows showing whether the destination is straight ahead, to the left or right.
Street signs installed as part of the project will include a numerical range of addresses above the street name. Installation of the signs and 650 wastebaskets is to begin later this year, Mr. Weisbrod said.
Though undertaken privately, the plan fits into the Giuliani administration's downtown revitalization effort, said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission.
"The streetscape in lower Manhattan has had a down-at-the-heels quality," Mr. Rose said. "Having it be a pleasant, uplifting, intelligible experience -- as opposed to a bewildering one -- is an important part of shaping attitudes."
The project is to proceed on a "pay-as-you-go" basis, Mr. Weisbrod said, financed by the earmarking of 2.5 cents out of the 12.7-cent-a-square-foot annual assessment paid by property owners in the district. The Alliance will also use a $3 million reserve fund that it has accumulated.
The largest element of the streetscape plan is an $11 million reconstruction of Broadway from Bowling Green to Murray Street, near City Hall, with new sidewalks, curbs and the special fixtures.
As an extra touch, the ticker-tape parades along the "Canyon of Heroes," as lower Broadway is called, will be commemorated in eight-inch granite bands set into the sidewalk pavement every 20 feet, with stainless steel letters spelling out the dates and names of those honored.
Improving the streetscape is a tangible declaration that "downtown is very much alive," said Robert R. Douglass, chairman of the Alliance and former vice chairman of the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "And there would be no more visible evidence than Broadway, which is the major signature street."
The overall design is by Cooper, Robertson & Partners, a firm chosen in part because Alexander Cooper was co-architect of the master plan for Battery Park City.
"The instruction we were given was that we should avoid a 'B.I.D. esthetic,' " Mr. Cooper said. "The esthetic should be targeted to this place and not be 34th Street or 42d Street redux."
That left the question of what the lampposts should look like. At Battery Park City, the "bishop's-crook" design of the 19th century has been brought back to handsome effect.
"A no-brainer would have been historic fixtures," Mr. Cooper said. "But we thought that the approach that would set off historic buildings the best would be to use a contemporary fixture that was classical in its way and understated; that did not call attention to itself."
The result is an unadorned L-shaped lamppost 26 feet high, with an octagonal steel shaft that tapers into a cylinder as it rises. The lamp is housed in a disk at the end of a 6-foot arm. A companion piece is an even simpler 15 1/2-foot-high fixture topped by a slender, 3-foot-high cylindrical lamp.
Pentagram Design is responsible for the signage, Caribiner Communications for the lighting, Quennell Rothschild Associates for the landscaping and Vollmer Associates for the engineering.
More and more attention is being paid to the esthetics of so-called street furniture. Last year, the bidders seeking a citywide franchise for bus-stop shelters, newsstands and public toilets were some of the more highly regarded architects in the world.
Richard Meier, the architect of the new J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, designed the proposal submitted by Adshel Inc.; Josef Paul Kleihues designed the proposal by Wall City Design Inc. and Nicholas Grimshaw designed the proposal by Transportation Displays Inc..
For its submission, JCDecaux New York assembled a roster of celebrated architects and designers: Peter Eisenman, Sir Norman Foster, Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel, James Stewart Polshek, Robert A. M. Stern, Massimo Vignelli, and Tod Williams and Billie Tsien.
On Friday, however, the Transportation Department informed the bidders that a citywide franchise would not be awarded. Instead, the agency said it would explore a program "that would encourage competition and greater design variation in the structures to distinguish the city's neighborhoods."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Tells Of Hopes and Risks On Trade

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Wednesday, July 1

 BODY:
President Clinton told American business leaders today that corruption, environmental neglect, weak financial regulation and restrictive trade practices threaten China's growth and full entry into the global economic system.
In an address to the American Chamber of Commerce here, Mr. Clinton said rapid economic growth has brought significant challenges to the Chinese Government and people. 
 He said the dynamic growth of the last 20 years and the rapid pace of reform have changed the lives of Chinese citizens, bringing more career choices and opportunities to run their own businesses, but also breaking the system of guaranteed lifetime employment as Beijing slashes payrolls at Government-owned enterprises.
"China's economy still is burdened with complicated and overlapping barriers," Mr. Clinton said in his 21-minute address at the Portman Ritz Carlton hotel. He said he hoped that Beijing would make the difficult decisions needed to bring China into the World Trade Organization on the same terms that govern the other members of the global trading body.
"China and, indeed, Shanghai, face major challenges in advancing economic progress beyond the present point," the President said.
He specifically cited the problems of inefficient state monopolies, weak legal and regulatory systems, wasteful and polluting energy patterns, corruption, closed markets and poor supervision of the nation's banks.
"The United States is prepared to work with China in meeting these challenges because the success of China will affect not only the Chinese people and Chinese prosperity, but America's well-being and global stability as well."
The White House also announced today that Mr. Clinton would meet in Hong Kong with Martin Lee, the leading advocate for democracy there. This is a calculated affront to Beijing, which took control of the former British colony a year ago. The White House is playing down the meeting, which will take place in the President's suite at the Hyatt Hotel Kong on Friday. No public statements are planned, officials said.
In a concession to Beijing on another sensitive issue, Mr. Clinton formally stated on Tuesday that the United States did not support independence for Taiwan.
The Chinese Government, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province that should be politically reunited with the mainland, had pressed Mr. Clinton to state the American policy while he was on Chinese soil.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other officials have expressed the carefully worded position on other occasions. But it was important to Beijing that the words come from the President himself, and he obliged during a discussion with Shanghai residents today.
In response to a question from Wu Xinbo, a professor in the American Studies Institute at Fudan University here, Mr. Clinton said he had told Jiang Zemin, China's President, that American policy on Taiwan remained unchanged.
Reiterating what is known as "the three no's," Mr. Clinton said: "I had a chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy, which is that we don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement."
Taiwan reacted harshly, although Mr. Clinton followed the same formula that American officials have used before. "The United States and Chinese Communists have no rights and are in no position to conduct bilateral talks on anything related to our affairs," said Roy Wu, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry spokesman.
There is considerable debate about how new Mr. Clinton's statement is. The "three no's" formula was publicly used last fall by the State Department, which saw it as a reiteration of longstanding policy. But some scholars and supporters of Taiwan say the formula, as it was expressed then, was more detailed and restrictive than past statements, and they called on Mr. Clinton to disavow it.
Officials traveling with Mr. Clinton tried to minimize the importance of the President's statement. He told the same thing to Mr. Jiang, they said, and there was no intention of putting it into a written communique, which would give it more weight.
"The President himself had indicated prior to coming here that he would reaffirm longstanding U.S. policy, and he did so," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. "During the course of this visit we've made it clear both publicly and privately that we hope the people of Taiwan and the people of the People's Republic find an amicable resolution to the question of Taiwan."

HEADLINE: Alabama Governor Wins Runoff in Triumph for the Right

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., June 30

 BODY:
In a convincing victory for religious conservatives, Gov. Fob James Jr. won a decisive majority tonight over the businessman Winton Blount 3d in Alabama's Republican primary runoff for governor.
The Governor's triumph sets up another intriguing battle, in the general election in November, when Mr. James will face Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman, who easily won the Democratic nomination four weeks ago. Mr. Siegelman, who has hoarded cash while the Republicans skirmished, hopes that his proposal for a new lottery to finance education will help break the Republicans' near stranglehold on statewide offices in this once solidly Democratic state. 
 The caustic Republican campaign was seen very much as a referendum on Mr. James, 63, whose unvarnished political style and strong support for school prayer have made him a modern-day emblem of Southern defiance. In his campaign, the Governor alternated between Christian professions of God-fearing faith and a less charitable take on his opponent, whom he mocked for his heft and his inherited wealth.
The race also provided an unobstructed view of the strains facing the South's newly dominant Republican Party. While each man embraced some of the other's positions, Mr. James spoke most passionately to the state's social conservatives while Mr. Blount harped on the need to accelerate economic growth.
With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. James led Mr. Blount by 56 percent to 44 percent. The Governor finished first in the five-man primary on June 2, but could not enough to escape a runoff.
"It's always good to have a tough scrimmage or two before the big game," said a beaming Mr. James after declaring victory tonight. "And I've had two."
For the adaptable Mr. James, an Auburn University football star who made a fortune selling plastic-coated barbells, today's victory extends a resilient political career. Mr. James has switched parties twice in the last two decades, and he has needed a runoff to win his party's nomination in each of three campaigns for governor. He first renounced his Republican roots before running successfully for governor as a Democrat in 1978. After choosing not to seek a second term, he switched back to the Republican Party to run in 1994.
A poll taken last week showed this year's race to be a dead heat, with Mr. Blount leading by a single percentage point. But in the end, the mechanics of a midsummer runoff with few other races on the ballot favored Mr. James, who apparently succeeded in pulling his Christian conservative supporters to the polls. Last week's survey, which was taken for three Alabama newspapers, showed that he was overwhelmingly favored by those who said they took the Bible to be literal truth.
Mr. James and his advisers did not shy from his identification with the religious right. In advertisements and public appearances, Mr. James boasted about his quixotic efforts to reverse the United States Supreme Court's three-decade-old rulings against school prayer.
Mr. James's lead consultant, Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition, contended that the election would serve as a national test of the strength of Christian conservatives. "I don't need to tell you that in God's wisdom and planning, the eyes of America are going to be on Alabama on June 30," Mr. Reed told a group of ministers last week.
Mr. Blount took pains to insist that he, too, was for returning prayer to the schools. But he argued that Mr. James's open talk of sedition, including a court brief suggesting that Supreme Court rulings do not bind the states, had been a national embarrassment. In addition to distracting attention from the need to improve schools and recruit new industry, Mr. Blount said, the Governor's approach to school prayer harked back to the days when Gov. George C. Wallace used state's rights arguments to stymie desegregation.
Mr. Blount, 54, is the son of Winton M. Blount, a Montgomery construction and manufacturing magnate. The younger Mr. Blount owns automobile dealerships and a plastics company, and he outspent Mr. James by nearly two to one, financing his campaign with his own money and that of his family. The centerpiece of his campaign was a proposal to eliminate the state's 4 percent sales tax on food, which served to counter Mr. James's pledge not to raise state taxes.
Mr. Blount had hoped to benefit from an unusual provision that allows all Alabama voters to participate in a Republican primary runoff, regardless of whether they voted or how they voted in the first primary. Last week, Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. of Birmingham, a five-term Democrat, endorsed Mr. Blount for the Republican nomination and announced that his mostly black political machine, the Jefferson County Citizens Coalition, would work to turn out Democratic votes for him.
Mr. James's strategists worried that Democratic voters could provide the margin of victory for Mr. Blount. But they worked assiduously in the campaign's final days to encourage a backlash by portraying Mr. Arrington as a liberal Democratic boss who had demanded concessions on appointments and spending priorities from Mr. Blount. That contention was denied by both men.
In a final television advertisement broadcast last weekend, Mr. James charged that "Winton Blount sold out the Republican Party." Picturing Mr. Blount beside Mr. Arrington, who is black, the advertisement asked, "If he wins Tuesday, who'll be the real Governor?" Mr Blount accused Mr. James of making a racial appeal, an accusation he denied.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Corporate Underwriting Soared in First Half of '98

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Wall Street generated more money for corporate America in the first half of this year than any other six-month period in history, as historically low interest rates and a still buoyant stock market gave fresh momentum to the business of issuing stock and debt.
The frenzied pace of underwriting has helped finance consolidation in almost every area of industry, reflected in the record pace of mergers and acquisitions. Companies worldwide completed mergers and acquisitions valued at $1.36 billion in the first half of this year, double the figure from the corresponding period a year ago. 
 The money-raising boom also channeled funds into start-up companies and financed investment in technology and production equipment at larger ones, helping prime America's economy for strong expansion in the second half, analysts said.
"My sense is that this reflects a great entrepreneurial spirit in the economy," said Peter Blanton, an equity capital markets specialist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "You have people who are starting companies or companies investing in new growth areas because of the availability of capital today. That means it is having an effect on the real economy."
At just shy of $1 trillion, securities companies raised almost as much money for clients in the January to June period as they did during the whole of last year, which was in itself a record, according to the Securities Data Company of Newark. That, in turn, has meant soaring profits for Wall Street's leading securities companies. Many have seen their already strong earning growth accelerate so far this year with jumps of one-third or more in first-half profits.
The question for many on Wall Street is whether the underwriting juggernaut will meet resistance in the second half. Some analysts expect that the drop in interest rates this year prompted a one-time jump in companies seeking to take advantage of low rates to refinance earlier debt. That trend will not necessarily continue in the second half, as debt offerings slowed significantly as the second quarter came to a close.
"We have been seeing nearly perfect conditions for people to borrow money," said Jeff Chandler, head of the global debt syndicate desk at Merrill Lynch & Company, Wall Street's leading debt underwriter. "But I would be hard pressed to say that the level of issuance is going to continue."
The outlook for stock issues is also murky. Many securities firms say they have a large backlog of equity offerings that should keep them busy through the year, as hundreds of companies have taken the first steps toward raising capital on the public markets and world governments continue to sell the public stakes in government-controlled phone and energy companies.
But the stock market has turned choppy in recent weeks and investors have become fussier about what kinds of newly issued stocks they want to buy. June was one of the worst months in recent memory for initial public offerings, with at least a dozen companies that were scheduled to issue shares deciding to hold off until market conditions improve.
"We have a combination of a more flattish market and a more selective buyer. Things are slower going into the summer," said Thomas Tuft, co-head of global equity capital markets at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Others see new stock issues picking up in the fall, however, as some delayed deals from the summer and a bulging backlog of fresh corporate offerings compete for investors' attention.
With Wall Street steaming ahead at top speed, there was enough business to keep every big investment bank bustling. But the battle to lock up clients and generate fees was as fierce as ever, with the major brokerage houses fighting for the top spots on the quarterly league tables, the brokerage house rankings.
For the second quarter, Merrill Lynch was the clear leader in overall offerings of debt and equity. In total, Merrill underwrote $169 billion of securities, for a 16.9 percent market share. Salomon Smith Barney was No. 2, with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman, Sachs and Lehman Brothers rounding out the top five.
Ranked by underwriting initial public offerings of stock, the most hotly contested brokerage business because of the large fees associated with that work, Goldman, Sachs took a dominant leadership position. The private bank underwrote about $2.5 billion worth of new issues, for a 22 percent market share. Morgan Stanley, Salomon Smith Barney, Prudential Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston made up the top five.
Merrill Lynch was a surprise laggard in new equity issues so far this year. A Merrill official said, however, that a large initial public offering priced yesterday, the last day of the second quarter, would make it the second-largest underwriter for the period if that deal were added to its total.
Salomon Smith Barney, which itself is the result of a merger late last year, put in a strong equity underwriting performance after slipping in the rankings last year. The company ranked third among brokerage firms for equity underwriting so far this year, compared with a seventh-place performance in the corresponding period a year ago.
"I think this is indicative of the type of equity distribution we put together," said Jim Cowles, head of equity capital markets at Salomon. "After the merger, we are bringing in clients that we did not have before."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 2, 1998, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about corporate underwriting in the first half of the year understated the value of completed mergers and acquisitions worldwide in the period. There were $1.36 trillion worth of deals, not $1.36 billion.

HEADLINE: Birth Rate Falls to 40-Year Low Among Unwed Black Women

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The birth rate for unmarried black women, long a focal point in the debate over the causes of poverty among African-Americans, has reached its lowest point in 40 years, Federal health officials said today.
According to figures compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics, there were 74.4 births per 1,000 unmarried black women in 1996 -- the last year for which complete data are available. That rate is significantly below the peak of 90.7 per 1,000 unmarried black women reached in 1989. 
 Today's report showed that the out-of-wedlock birth rate has been dropping for all age groups of black women. Demographers and health officials said that some of the possible reasons -- an increase in contraceptive use, sex education and efforts by some community groups to encourage abstention -- should allow the trend to continue.
"There's just been no letup, and it's not been slowing down," said Stephanie J. Ventura, a demographer with the National Center for Health Statistics who wrote the report. "And it's not just for teen-agers. For all black women under 30, the declines have been really big."
The figures on fertility rates for unmarried black women are part of an annual report on births compiled by the Health Statistics Center, a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Using data from birth certificates submitted by the states, the report analyzed the 3.9 million births that occurred in 1996 and highlighted a number of trends, including these:
*Fewer babies were born that year than in any year since 1987; the continued decline put the number of births at 6 percent below the recent high point, which was 1990;
*The number of multiple births rose sharply, and resulted in 5,298 sets of triplets, 560 sets of quadruplets and 81 sets of quintuplets. The multiple births contributed to a 10 percent increase in the number of low birth-weight babies since 1984;
*Smoking among pregnant teen-agers increased, particularly among Mexican-American, Puerto Rican and black teen-agers; but overall smoking during pregnancy continued to decrease.
One of the most closely watched numbers is the out-of-wedlock birth rate for black women, long considered one of the clearest symptoms, and some say causes, of many problems that have plagued poor blacks.
The decline in that rate is part of a continuing decrease in fertility among all black women -- teen-age and adult, married and unmarried -- which means that the percentage of black births to unmarried women remains virtually unchanged from the previous year at 69.8 percent.
There has even been a small but notable decrease in the overall birth rate among unmarried women, to 44.8 per 1,000 in 1996 from 46.9 per 1,000 in 1994. That stems from a drop in the birth rate among unmarried white woman, which had more than doubled from 1980 to 1994 before it began to drop, hitting 37.6 per 1,000 women in 1996.
Even as the number of unmarried black women bearing children has been dropping, the percentage of black children who are born out-of-wedlock remains high. It was 69.8 percent of black births in 1996. The comparable figures for non-Hispanic whites was 21.5 percent and for Hispanics, 40.7 percent.
Some experts said the percentage of children born outside of marriage was more meaningful than the birth rate of unmarried women as a sign that too many black children were being raised in environments where they were most at risk to become engaged in crime, drug abuse, or other anti-social behavior.
"If you care about the link between black poverty and children in single-parent households, you want to know what percentage of black babies are born into one-parent households," said Stephan Thernstrom, co-author of "America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible." "I don't think there's been a decline in that. That would be real news."
Demographers say the Government has kept accurate birth statistics by race and marital status since 1955. Until 1969, the statistics lumped black women into a category that included all racial minorities, but experts say the vast portion of births to nonwhites in those years were to black women. The previous low birth rate for unmarried black women was 75.2 per 1,000 in 1984.
The fact that the out-of-wedlock birth rate among blacks is lower now than it was in the 1950's and 1960's surprised even experts who follow these trends.
"If you had asked me about that before these data came out, I would not have been aware of that," Jacqueline Darroch, vice president for research at the Alan Guttmacher Institute. "And I don't think most people would be either."
Ms. Darroch and Federal health officials gave several reasons for the decrease in the out-of-wedlock birth rate for black women: improved contraceptive use, especially a sharp increase among black women of passive, long-acting birth control methods like Norplant, Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices.
Some health officials also say that stepped up efforts by community groups to provide sex education or help young black women abstain from sex are beginning to pay off. And some said that the AIDS epidemic is causing more black women to take precautions like using condoms that can also lower the pregnancy rate.
"We really did scare people," said Dr. Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services. "The remarkable increase in condom use by African-Americans is directly attributed to AIDS."
Changes in the welfare system have not been a significant factor, according to some people who monitor fertility rates. Noting that out-of-wedlock birth rates for black women have been dropping steadily since 1989, they assert that the decline started before states and the Federal Government enacted welfare reform measures.
"This is happening at a time when the economy is improving," said Kristin Moore, president of Child Trends, a research and advocacy group in Washington. "We're seeing a trend that pre-dated welfare reform, so I would more likely look at the economy as a hypothesis rather than welfare reform."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about birth rates referred incorrectly to the figures given for multiple births in 1996. The numbers represented individual babies, not sets of them. Thus 5,298 babies were born as triplets, 560 as quadruplets and 81 as quintuplets or in higher-order multiples.

HEADLINE: USER'S GUIDE;
Digital Bread Crumbs Through the Forest

BYLINE: By Michelle Slatalla; E-mail address: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR a long time, I thought that it was my fault that I could never find the information I wanted on the Web. My search method -- typing one or two words hastily into a query box -- rarely yielded worthwhile results.
So imagine my relief to learn that my approach is typical. A recently published study of one million queries conducted in a single day in 1997 on the Excite search site found that only one in nine users embrace the nuances of Boolean logic to concoct sophisticated queries. The rest of us "are basically entering one or two search terms in the query box," said Amanda Spink, one of the study's authors and an assistant professor in the School of Library and Information Sciences at the University of North Texas. 
 Since there is no evidence that users can be persuaded to change, search sites have begun to mold their tools to fit our habits. The challenge is to improve the search results even if users do not improve their search techniques.
The Excite search site has been the most innovative so far, taking the first steps toward what Chris Charron, an analyst at Forrester Research, describes as "adding real intelligence to the search function." What Excite (www.excite.com) has done is try to guess what a user is seeking -- the specific bit of information the user wants to know even when typing a general query -- and then to use that assumption as a starting point for search results.
Here is how it works: If you type a single keyword in the query box on the Excite home page -- try "orioles," for example -- you will see that Excite's staff has made the assumption (based on users' past patterns) that you want information about the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. The search results will be about the team but will not be limited to relevant Web pages from Excite's index. You will also get information culled from other databases -- including those of current publications, for example -- giving you game scores, the team's schedule and recent news articles. All that information will appear on the first screen of the search results.
Excite's co-founder Joe Kraus describes this approach as creating "channels" of information. It also takes into consideration the fact that some users who type "orioles" will not be looking for information about the sports team. For them, the search results page displays a prominent link to sites relevant to other meanings of the word.
Excite has organized information about public companies into channels, as well. So if you type "Microsoft" in the query box, the search results will display the information that past users have sought most frequently: the company's phone number and address, as well as recent news articles, culled from 350 publications, and the stock price (updated every 20 minutes).
When I tried out Excite's system, searching suddenly seemed fun. Not since the long-ago day when I finally mastered the intricacies of the Dewey Decimal System had I felt so empowered by the giddy knowledge that vast troves of valuable facts were mine for the asking. I felt, for a moment, as if the Web could live up to the so-far-mythical promise of organizing the world's information in a coherent and accessible fashion. Here was proof of the value of such a dynamic medium, where facts are in flux -- things like sports scores and stock prices change from minute to minute -- and the latest bits of data are just a click away.
It was easy to get spoiled, but reality brought me up short. It turns out that Excite has so far organized only a fraction of its available information into channels. So if you are searching for something other than information about a sports team or a public company, no channels for you. Back to the old search results, lists of Web sites that might or might not be relevant to the query.
That frustrated me at first. Why was Excite discriminating against users who wanted to search for "applesauce recipes" or "Chesapeake Bay retrievers"? Were we not entitled to, say, the most recent articles published on those topics? But Mr. Kraus calmed me with the news that Excite will expand the scope of its intelligent search function, with plans in the next few months to create a number of other channels on topics like health, cities and celebrities. These channels are likely to appeal to a broad cross-section of users; Ms. Spink's analysis found that users often searched for information about a specific person or place.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to organize all information into channels, Mr. Kraus said. "If you want to know something very specific -- say, the effects of sleep deprivation on heart disease in men on the East Coast -- we won't ever be able to program a channel to answer that query," he said. "That's what we call a needle-in-a-haystack query." To increase the success rate for those kinds of searches, some sites have borrowed a technique that off-line information retrieval systems have been using for decades: improving the relevance of search results.
Infoseek (www.infoseek.com), for instance, determined from search patterns that when most users searched for "airlines," they wanted search results that included the home pages of major airlines. So search results now include those pages.
Another search site, Cnet's Snap (www.snap.com), uses a recipe for finding relevant results to make searches more successful. When a user types a keyword query, the site's software automatically assesses the potential relevance of all the sites in its index, assigning a weight to each site's Web address, description and content, then using those weights to rank sites. To supplement its method, Snap has human editors assign keywords to specific documents to give them added weight. "We can quickly improve relevancy by responding to seasonal trends, news and current events," said Katharine English, the site's executive producer.
How relevant are the results? In my own unscientific experiments, I conducted searches on both sites to try to answer my 7-year-old daughter's question about the average life span of a house cat, and the results indicated that the technology still has a long way to go. It took me about 10 minutes of clicking on unlikely search results to learn that the answer is probably 15 years (according to a source who identified herself only as Cat Lady in a message she posted on the cat health bulletin board of Acme Pet).
Of course, the search results suggested that I might also find the answer at a link called "Stupid threatened Snakes Don't Deserve to Live." But at least I no longer think that's my fault.

HEADLINE: CURRENTS: URBAN RECLAMATION;
The University Calls In Its Flock

BYLINE: By Barbara Flanagan 

 BODY:
Factories used to be the big employers in American cities, and their workers (and owners) lived right downtown. When manufacturing moved out of cities like Baltimore; Birmingham, Ala.; Provo, Utah; New Haven, and Philadelphia, a strange phenomenon emerged. Colleges and universities replaced steel plants and knitting mills as the largest employers; but the faculties and staffs -- even students -- often commuted from the suburbs.
Now, academia has plunged into redeveloping downtown areas near campuses. Yale University invented a New Haven home buyer program to stabilize neighborhoods by helping faculty and staff members to buy homes. Started four years ago, the program has helped 301 people buy inner-city properties and has inspired other schools, like the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, to offer similar incentives. 
 Under Phase 3 of Yale's program, the university pays $25,000 over 10 years, including a $5,000 initial bonus, to any qualified faculty or staff member who buys a home in a designated area. Over the life of the program, the university will have invested about $7.5 million.
Gila Reinstein, 53, a public information officer at Yale who lives with her teen-age son, bought a town house, top, on Bradley Street through the program. "It's great," she said. "I have an urban garden and I can walk to work." Cheryl Morrison, center in dress, a staff member of the graduate school, bought a house on Howard Street.

HEADLINE: Record Immigrant Flow Fuels U.S. Home Market

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
WHEN the Lennar Corporation, a building concern, held some home-buying fairs for Florida properties recently, they turned out to be bonanzas for the company, with some leading to six or seven sales on the spot. That may not seem unusual given the strong United States housing market. But these fairs were held in such countries as Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic.
With immigrants flowing into the United States at a record-breaking rate, the fairs are an example of the importance home builders are placing on a demographic group that many analysts and economists expect to fuel the housing industry in the 21st century. 
 "We feel it's important to establish a relationship with these people as soon as possible," said Rita Gonzalez, the director of marketing for Dade County with Miami-based Lennar, which is the fifth-largest United States home builder.
Attracted by a strong economy and an abundance of jobs, people from all over the world are coming to the United States in search of the dream of financial security -- not to mention a house with a two-car garage.
This has the $800 billion housing industry optimistic, especially now that it can no longer count on a stream of baby boomers to buy new houses, as has been the case for much of the last 30 years. The bulk of these Americans are now middle-aged and on their second homes.
"Without immigrants, home-building starts would level off," said Stan Ross, a vice chairman with Ernst & Young's real estate group. "This is a wake-up call."
According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, more than 10 million foreigners are expected to enter the United States this decade, surpassing the record of 8.8 million from 1901 through 1910. Unlike in the early part of the century, when Ellis Island served as the gateway for millions of Europeans seeking a new life, today's immigrants are mainly from Latin America and Asia.
"The sheer numbers are immense," said Robert Strudler, chairman of the U.S. Home Corporation, the nation's eighth-largest home builder. "We have to take advantage of what's staring us in the face."
U.S. Home, a Houston-based company, has a joint venture with GIG Desarrolladores Inmobiliarios S.A., one of Mexico's largest builders, to construct homes in Texas, Arizona and Florida, all of them priced at less than $70,000.
Beazer Homes USA Inc. of Atlanta and its Mexican partner, Corporacion GEO S.A., are building homes along the Texas border priced at $35,000 to $45,000. Beazer expects the venture to generate $150 million in annual revenue by 2001.
So far, sales to immigrants have had a small impact on earnings for home builders, the companies say. But that impact is expected to grow. The number of immigrant homeowners, which rose by 47 percent to 4.7 million from 1980 to 1995, is expected to grow an additional 45 percent to 6.8 million by 2010, according to Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest provider of home mortgage funds.
Heading into the 21st century, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Houston and their surrounding areas are likely to be affected the most by immigration, analysts say.
Some builders are tailoring their business to suit immigrants. A development in Irvine, Calif., has no home with the number "4" on it because in certain Asian cultures it is a symbol for death. And many people from Latin American nations prefer homes with more than the usual three or four bedrooms to house extended families, some builders say.
"What we are learning is that the immigrant market isn't just one market; it's 100 different markets," said Randall Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes Group, which builds homes in California and Nevada.
Mr. Lewis says he is hiring members of minorities to bridge the communication and cultural gap between the home office and buyers. "When our sales staff gets together, it looks like a meeting of the United Nations," he said.
At a Lewis development in Fontana, Calif., an hour east of Los Angeles, Latin Americans bought about half of the 170 homes. They were drawn to the development, Mr. Lewis said, because homes were built with the living quarters behind a garage that butted up against the street, a style popular throughout Latin America and which immigrants from those countries like for security reasons.
Many of today's immigrants are more educated and more prosperous than their predecessors, and become homeowners soon after their arrival. About 12 percent of recent immigrants have graduate degrees, compared with 8 percent of native-born citizens, according to the National Academy of Sciences.
Some mortgage lenders are making it easier for immigrants. Among other things, they are requiring borrowers to show only a year of stable employment rather than the usual two years.
Joe Varusco, who is in the export business, moved his wife and four children to a Miami suburb from Sao Paulo, Brazil, four years ago. Last year, Mr. Varusco, 39, bought a $180,000 house from Lennar, and found United States lenders more agreeable to work with than the ones back in Brazil.
"Here, it's much easier to buy a house because banks are willing to lend you money for 20 or 30 years," he said. "In Brazil, they don't want to do that."
Newcomers to the United States who rent are almost three times more likely than adult renters to consider buying a home their "No. 1 priority," according to a survey by Fannie Mae. And immigrants, on the whole, are more likely than all adults to buy a home within the next three years, it found.

HEADLINE: Taking on New Forms, Electronic Books Turn a Page

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
LET'S face it, if the printed book had just been invented, it would probably get three stars out of five in reviews from the computer magazines. A review of Paper Book 1.0 might conclude with the following summary:
"Pros: Lightweight, portable, inexpensive, high resolution, practically unbreakable, available in multiple languages, easily annotated with write-only stylus, requires no batteries. Can be read while sitting in the smallest room of the house. 
 "Cons: Pages are static rather than dynamic (they cannot be updated once printed); fonts and type sizes are fixed; lack of backlighting makes it difficult to read at night without an external light source; topic selection is limited; paper is inefficient, bulky and subject to mildew and yellowing; paper production is environmentally unfriendly, and content is vulnerable to rampant copyright violations."
"In subsequent versions," the electronic reviewers might write, "we would like to see the Paper Book add interactivity, hyperlinking, a built-in dictionary, animated illustrations, on-line connections to content repositories, encryption to protect the publisher's copyright and other features we take for granted in electronic books."
Printed books have been popular for five centuries, of course, and have enjoyed great success despite the aforementioned shortcomings. But that hasn't stopped recent generations of science fiction authors, futurists, entrepreneurs and even politicians from fantasizing about electronic and digital books.
Speaker Newt Gingrich told an audience last month that replacing printed textbooks with computers should be a goal of the Federal Government. "I would hope within five years they would have no more textbooks," Mr. Gingrich said. In Texas, the chairman of the State Board of Education has proposed spending billions of dollars in coming years to replace printed books with laptop computers and electronic books.
"Like a comet on some weird, loopy orbit, this idea comes around every 10 years or so," said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research group based in Menlo Park, Calif. "Each time we get a closer approximation."
This time around, at least three digital approximations of books are scheduled to be introduced, beginning in the fall. You would casually entrust none of them to a fifth grader and would not, for that matter, take any of them to the beach tossed into a bag with sand and tanning lotion. All are essentially portable computers with touch-activated screens and special modifications for retrieving, storing and displaying digital versions of printed material.
The first scheduled to arrive is the midsize Softbook, a sleek tablet with a supple leather cover. The Softbook weighs about three pounds and has a screen not quite big enough to display a single page of a hardcover book.
The Softbook is expected to cost $299 when it goes on sale in September, but the buyer will also be required to pay a monthly subscription fee of $9.95 for a package of services that will include local telephone access to the Softbook Press library and a bundle of public domain and special publications. Additional fees will be charged for downloading copyrighted books and publications. A $19.95 monthly plan for more active readers will also be available.
To load the Softbook with "content," as writing is known these days, the user will simply plug any standard phone line into the Softbook's built-in modem port and tap a connection icon on the screen, and the Softbook will do the rest. No desktop computer will be needed.
Sometime before the end of the year, the Rocketbook will be on the market. The smallest of the three electronic books, the Rocketbook can be held in one hand; it weighs about half as much as the Softbook (the Rocketbook's designer also designed the Palm Pilot). Nuvomedia, the Rocketbook's creator, has financial backing from the investment arm of the global publishing giant Bertelsmann A.G. and from Barnes and Noble. Both companies apparently see a potential cost advantage in not having to print, ship, stock and store paper-based books.
No subscription fee will be required for the Rocketbook, but the device will cost about $500 when it reaches the market, about the time when winter weather sets in and people are thinking of curling up in front of a fireplace with a good book.
Unlike the Softbook, the Rocketbook will have to be inserted into a special "cradle" connected to an personal computer with Internet access. The user will shop at any on-line bookstore but the book ordered will not be sent by mail; the words will stream into the Rocketbook instead.
Both the Softbook and Rocketbook companies contend that they have struck agreements with almost all of the world's great book publishing and information companies and that current best-sellers as well as specialized publications will be available when they open for business.
The only one of the three new models that actually resembles a book is the EB Dedicated Reader, which is being developed by Everybook Inc. of Middletown, Pa. Now in the prototype stage, the Reader is not expected to reach the market until next year. When it does arrive, it is expected to cost $1,400 to $1,600, a rich vessel indeed for bodice-ripping romance novels but perhaps reasonable for a twin-screened book that can display two full-size, facing pages at once, in the exact format of the printed-on-paper version, with color and the ability to show engineering diagrams and mathematical formulas.
"A single-screen device is not a book -- it's a tablet," said the Reader's inventor, Dan Munyan, who says that his product will be the first true electronic book. "The last person to read and enjoy a tablet was Moses."
Unlike the two other contenders, the Reader is designed to use the Portable Document Format (.pdf) files that recreate a paper document's layout and type styles on any computer screen. Mr. Munyan said he expected the Reader to appeal mainly to customers on the high end of the professional reference-book market, those who spend a thousand or more tax-deductible dollars on reference works a year.
Even the inventors of these first models stress that they are not intended to replace the paperback novel. "You can't beat paperbacks," Mr. Munyan said. "Paperback books are too cheap." Instead, all are trying to win customers among professionals like doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers and others who need to keep reading updated journals and reference works. Yes, there will be room in the digital book's memory for a guilty pleasure or two -- the smallest digital book can hold the equivalent of 10 trashy novels -- but realistically, the economics of it will make sense mainly for getting instant access to professional texts.
A digital book would have some undeniable advantages. Students would not be bent under bulging backpacks filled with heavy textbooks. Children would not have to read by flashlight under the covers after curfew at night because a button turns on the illumination for the book's display screen (and shuts it off quickly when footsteps approach). The children's parents could dispense with unstylish reading glasses because another button would instantly swell the book's text to a larger size.
In theory, an on-line bookstore could have hundreds of thousands of book titles ready for instant delivery. There would no longer be out-of-print books because once a title was digitized, there would be no cost to "print" another copy, even for one customer. In reality, though, very few books today exist in digital form, so publishers or distributors would have to pay several hundred dollars each to have older books retyped or scanned into a computer. Establishing electronic royalties for authors and illustrators would be a legal morass. Other than that, because the publisher has no paper, printing and distribution costs, one could expect the cost of a digitally delivered book to be less than that of one tattooed onto dried paste made from dead trees. Then again, one would have thought that audio CD's would cost less than vinyl LP's.
For teachers and students, the digital books hold the promise of never being outdated. Unfamiliar words and concepts would be defined with a tap on the screen, calling up a dictionary entry or supplementary text, all through hyperlinks. For professionals, things like medical journal articles and timely tax and legal information would be a click away.
As CD-ROM encyclopedias have shown, digital books can be enhanced with sound, video, animation, hyperlinking, automatic updating and interactive story lines. Of course, paper books don't crash, run out of battery power over Nebraska, spew error messages, demand periodic upgrades, require technical support, attract professional thieves, entice the purchase of expensive upgrades or go to the repair shop for days at a time -- all issues that Mr. Gingrich and the Texas schoolbook officials apparently believe won't apply to digital books.
And experience suggests that even if people own expensive, high-resolution desktop displays, they typically prefer to send long blocks of text to a printer rather than read them on a computer screen.
All things considered, however, digital books appear to be inevitable, not as a replacement, for paper books, but as an alternative. Microprocessors are getting smaller, more powerful and cheaper as displays are getting bigger, thinner and cheaper; memory capacity is getting bigger and cheaper; Internet access is becoming ubiquitous and cheaper, and book production and distribution costs are getting more expensive.
And in the even more distant future, the line between paper and electronic books may blur. In Cambridge, Mass., Prof. Joe Jacobson of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is trying to create an "ink" sensitive to electronic fields that, when printed on thin plastic, fabric or even paper, will lead to a book that can publish itself. The New York Times is a sponsor of several research projects at the Media Lab.
The ink is actually microscopic particles embedded in the paper, inside tiny capsules, that flip over in response to changes in an electric field. When they are flipped one way, they appear black; when they flop the other way, they are white. Electrical signals originating in the spine of the book tell the particles how to line up, creating text that can be rewritten over and over.
A book printed with so-called electronic ink could very closely approximate a traditional printed book, including paper pages. But depending on what the user wanted to read, the book could erase and redraw itself with new text and illustrations.
Realistically, a digital book printed with electronic ink is years, if not decades, away. But Professor Jacobson has formed a private company, E Ink, to find commercial uses for electronic ink in the near term, in products like clothing and wallpaper that could change patterns and display advertisements. Several newspaper, magazine, advertising and electronics companies see the technology as so compelling that they have poured millions of dollars into the research this year.
What's next? Professor Jacobson thinks that it might soon be possible to print logic circuits, transistors and other computational devices on paper, cloth or plastic, creating, in effect, a two-dimensional personal computer. If his group of physicists, chemists and engineers is successful, someday people won't have to carry books or computers -- they can simply wear them.

Primakov in Cyprus

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Prima kov of Russia long the K.G.B.'s top operative in the Middle East and still Saddam Hussein's closest ally -- sees himself as a new Andrei Gromyko.
Unlike that Soviet stoneface, Primakov represents no superpower. But because he now runs Boris Yeltsin's foreign policy, and because he has the latest Russian missiles to sell, this Gromyko with a smiling face has found a way to split the NATO alliance by inflaming Greeks and Turks over the island of Cyprus. 
 Cypriots on that independent Mediterranean island near Turkey number 650,000 ethnic Greeks and 200,000 ethnic Turks. When Greek nationalists got pushy in 1974, Ankara sent in troops to protect its Turkish minority in the north, cruelly driving out Greek residents, setting up a republic that the world does not recognize, and establishing air control over the whole island. Cypriots have been glaring at each other ever since. (You have to be Irish to understand.)
The Greek Cypriot Government is irritated at Turkey's air control. It is feeling feisty at the European Union's signs that it could gain membership in the coveted economic club, especially since the E.U. has snubbed Muslim Turkey.
To assert its nationhood, Greek Cypriots went shopping for surface-to-air missiles that could knock down Turkey's planes if war came. First stop was the U.S.; no sale. Then Europe; none of its nations would join in an obvious military provocation of Turkey, a NATO member.
Along comes Primakov, lighting a match in the gas-filled room. How much do you Cypriots have to spend? $200 million. At $5 million a missile, that'll buy you 40 of our best new S-300's, not only threatening Turkish air domination, but capable with some modifications of hitting Turkish soil. When can you take delivery? September. A deal.
The Turks are reacting to this deal today the way the Kennedy Administration did when Khrushchev put the Soviet missiles on ships to Cuba: You put those missiles in and we'll take them out. The nuclear missiles Gromyko lied about were 90 miles from the U.S.; these offensively defensive SAM's are 50 miles from Turkey.
Primakov has a fistful of interests in Cyprus. His commercial interest is in getting hard currency for Russian arms and keeping missile factories humming.
Especially delicious to the ex-spymaster is the espionage interest: Cyprus has long been the intelligence crossroads of the Eastern Mediterranean, of benefit to Syria, Iraq and Libya. Turks charge that along with the missiles would come Russian "technicians" to bolster Russia's intelligence network.
Fourth, international spooks know that corporations in Cyprus's capital, Nicosia -- a city split by a "green line" like a Berlin wall separating Greeks and Turks -- have for years made it the money-laundering capital of the Middle East. Our State Department says the Greek south is now cleaner than the Turkish north, but the whole island launders. Primakov will be able to monitor the flight of Russian rubles to foreign banks, and gain added leverage over Serbia, which gets clandestine foreign money support through Cyprus.
Finally, the strategic interest. Cyprus is the flashpoint of a Greek-Turkish tension that extends into the Balkans. Here was Primakov's way to retaliate at NATO expansion by breaking apart the southern flank of the Western alliance -- not only at no cost to Russia, but at a profit.
Madeleine Albright, in a meeting with Primakov in Luxembourg in May, tried to talk him out of shipping the missiles; she failed.
Richard Holbrooke, unable to negotiate the Cypriot factions into a sensible "bizonal, bicommunal" federation, creatively tried to use the impending Cyprus crisis as a shoehorn to ease Turkey into being fairly considered for E.U. membership. But the Germans and Greeks would have none of that.
As a result of Primakov's maneuvering and European anti-Turk bias, we now have (1) Ankara more adamant than ever about a separate Turkish Cypriot republic; (2) the U.N., which patrols the green line, passing resolutions blaming Turks for everything, and (3) Greeks lurching into a foolish missile provocation.
This thing could get out of hand. President Clinton should get on the horn to Yeltsin and say, "Tell Primakov to cancel that missile order."

HEADLINE: Iran's President Likes U.S. Tone but Says Actions Speak Louder

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, July 1

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran lauded the Clinton Administration today for softening its tone toward his country but added that a concrete change in American policy toward Iran was necessary.
Until today, Mr. Khatami had made no public comment on a speech by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright last month in which she called on Iran to help create a "road map" to normal relations or on the conciliatory words by President Clinton that followed. 
 But in a brief question-and-answer session with reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy, Mr. Khatami said: "We believe there is change in their tone, but we're always looking for action. Honesty lies in action, not words.
"I hope this change in tone is a gesture of better understanding by American politicians of the status of the Islamic Republic, the Iranian nation and the global situation."
Mr. Khatami did not break new ground with his comments calling on the United States to make a specific policy gesture. Other Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, have already articulated that view. But the absence of any direct criticism of the United States or any concrete demand by Mr. Khatami reflects a softer tone on the Iranian side.
Mr. Khatami seemed unaccustomed to the Western practice of a "press availability" after an official meeting, at which officials make a few comments, photographers shoot pictures and reporters fire off a few questions. But Mr. Prodi, who was traveling with a large press corps, was on a high-profile mission, and it was not surprising that the two emerged from their hourlong meeting at the Pink Palace in the presidential compound to greet the media.
Mr. Khatami asked Mr. Prodi in English whether he wanted to go first. Mr. Prodi replied in English: "I don't know. Which is your habit? For me it's O.K."
While reporters politely waited, expecting the officials to make opening statements, Mr. Khatami said in Persian: "Do they intend to ask questions or not? Or do they want to postpone this?"
After two questions, Mr. Khatami ended the brief encounter.
The visit by Mr. Prodi, one of the highest-ranking European officials to visit Iran since its 1979 revolution, was touted by both the Italian and the Iranian sides as a major political event.
For the Italians, the visit put Mr. Prodi in the vanguard of those Europeans who want to forge close ties -- particularly economic ties -- with Iran and are bargaining that Mr. Khatami can deliver on his promise to bring about the rule of law and liberalize the country.
But plummeting oil prices have deeply affected Iran's already damaged economy, and Teheran is not in a position to sign ambitious financial and industrial contracts.
For the Iranians, the visit helps rehabilitate their global image. The European Union countries briefly withdrew their ambassadors from Iran after the verdict by a German court last year that implicated the country's leadership in a terrorist bombing in Berlin six years ago. Recently, the Europeans have agreed informally to allow their foreign ministers to visit Iran.
But Mr. Prodi's visit ups the ante, and officials from a number of European countries were not at all happy that he had decided to make the trip without consulting them.
Early today, Mr. Prodi called his trip important "not only for Italy but also for Europe" and said it would "open a new chapter in relations."
In line with Mr. Khatami's mantra that there must be a "dialogue among civilizations," Mr. Prodi received an honorary doctoral degree from Teheran University and attended the opening of an exhibition at Teheran's Museum of Contemporary Art of graphic works on Islam by Italian artists.
Indeed, the official Iranian press agency reported that Mr. Khatami, in his meeting with Mr. Prodi, said, "Dialogue between civilizations requires Iran as the cradle of Islamic civilization and Italy as the parent of Western civilization to have exemplary and excellent relations with each other."

HEADLINE: In America;
Saving the Cities

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
For many years the goal of people concerned about the nation's cities was, for the most part, simply to stop the hemorrhaging. Crime seemed out of control, longtime residents were fleeing, entire neighborhoods were collapsing into rubble and ash.
Hard-core inner-city neighborhoods -- the South Bronx in New York, the Hough section of Cleveland, the Central Ward in Newark -- were seen by many as incurable concentrations of poverty and pathology. Much of the rest of the country closed its eyes and turned its back. Such neighborhoods, according to a particularly destructive but pervasive view, not only were beyond saving, they weren't worth saving. In the early 1980's a devastated neighborhood in Kansas City, Mo., was used as a location site for "The Day After," a television movie about the aftermath of a nuclear attack. 
 Hard at work but hardly noticed during those terrible years were the many men and women who, in small, often ragtag groups, rolled up their sleeves and did what they could to counter one of the biggest problems -- the desperate need for housing. Sometimes, in the midst of chaos and misery, their goal was to build just one house. Their attitude, invariably, was, "You have to start somewhere."
A couple of weeks ago the Clinton Administration released a report declaring that, finally, after decades of struggling, the nation's cities were rebounding. It's too early to reach for the champagne. The inner cities, especially, are still intensely isolated communities in which joblessness is high, poverty is rampant, drug addiction is flourishing and genuine opportunities are hard to come by.
But some very good things are happening. Crime is down, municipal budgets are in much better shape, and even in hard-core areas there are unmistakable early signs of renewal.
Go back now to the men and women who rolled up their sleeves and decided to build some housing. In the really tough neighborhoods, they are the unheralded heroes. Working with churches and small community organizations, they pulled off surprising early successes. New homes would go up on a block, or old buildings would be renovated, and before long a startling transformation would occur.
"I call it the miracle of small steps," said Paul Grogan, president of a national support group -- the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) -- that recognized the potential of these local groups, which came to be known, accurately but not very excitingly, as community development corporations, or C.D.C.'s.
Certain things happen when new homes, even a small number, appear in a previously blighted neighborhood. The construction itself creates economic activity. Architects and contractors are hired. New families are drawn to the neighborhood and a new sense of pride can be seen. Graffiti and other forms of vandalism tend to occur with less frequency.
"Blighted and abandoned housing sends a terrible signal," said Mr. Grogan, whose group held its annual meeting here this week. "It's a magnet for drugs and other criminal activity."
What groups like LISC have found is that the new or refurbished housing in most cases became a stabilizing force, a locally developed defense against what had appeared to be unstoppable blight.
Eventually, although very slowly, economic activity would pick up. As a Boston resident described it: "The neighborhood became a neighborhood again."
LISC and some other groups began working with C.D.C.'s several years ago, helping to arrange financing and offering the kind of expertise that allowed the local groups to operate on a much larger scale. What began small is now huge, and hugely important. LISC, the largest of the intermediary groups, has directly raised $3 billion in financing since 1979 and has leveraged $3.5 billion more. With the help of LISC and others, C.D.C.'s have built thousands upon thousands of units of decent affordable housing all across the country.
It's still not enough. There is still a critical shortage of affordable housing in the big cities. And there are many other problems as well. But the cities are better off than they have been in many years. And the men and women who built housing during the worst of times deserve to be applauded.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Selling uranium plants to enrich the private sector?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE Treasury's announcement on Monday that it would soon privatize the Government's half-century-old uranium enrichment plants made waves largely because of the proposed method of sale. While an initial public offering of shares in a Government-owned corporation is not unprecedented, it is certainly a novelty in keeping with the spirit of the high-flying stock market.
But the more important news is that the Treasury is moving forward in spite of years of warnings that the sale would undermine a key initiative for containing nuclear proliferation. For once the United States Enrichment Corporation is privatized, the company will have powerful financial incentives to find a means to back away from an agreement to import 500 tons of bomb-grade uranium from Russia. 
 "Privatization is a foreign policy disaster waiting to happen," argued Richard Falkenrath, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
When the cold war ended and Russia was left with a potent nuclear arsenal, Tom Neff, a physicist at M.I.T., had a brainstorm. Why not buy a chunk of Russia's stockpile of bomb-grade uranium, blend it with natural uranium to make fuel for commercial power reactors and resell it?
Why not, indeed: With much fanfare, Vice President Al Gore struck the swords-to-plowshares deal with President Boris N. Yeltsin in 1993. Russia would manufacture the reactor fuel from its bombs, and Washington would sell the fuel on world markets. Minatom, the Russian nuclear authority, with an estimated one million employees, would get cash to cover the wages of its impoverished nuclear scientists. Far less bomb-grade uranium would be left lying around Russia for someone to steal. And all this would happen without a dime from taxpayers.
The United States Enrichment Corporation, the Federal operator of the plants in Ohio and Kentucky that enrich natural uranium to commercial reactor fuel, was assigned to put the agreement in effect. That seemed the obvious way to go, save for one fact: In an entirely unrelated burst of enthusiasm for privatizing Government assets, Congress had earlier decreed that the public corporation should be sold to the highest responsible bidder.
Joseph Stiglitz, then the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, pointed to the conflict of interest. A privatized, profit-maximizing United States Energy Corporation, he argued, would have an incentive to buy as little Russian enriched uranium as possible -- at least as long as the price paid to the Russians was higher than the corporation's own (heavily subsidized) cost of producing each extra bit of reactor fuel.
But in a curious role reversal, the Government's national security establishment put the cause of reinventing government ahead of keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of malefactors. The State Department, Energy Department and the President's National Security Council all insisted that the corporation would do the right thing because Federal watchdogs would otherwise intervene.
Mr. Stiglitz was outgunned, but not outargued: There was already tangible evidence that the business conflict was real. For even as public servants, the corporation's managers had been caught secretly asking the Russians to slow deliveries to allow the corporation to sell more from its own inventory. And by Mr. Neff's analysis, the Government's will to keep the corporation on the straight and narrow is likely to be strained again.
As long as the price paid to Russia is less than the prevailing world price, the fuel can always be resold without cost to the Government. But Mr. Neff notes that the uranium fuel market is weak -- and will probably get weaker unless the Asian economies soon recover from their funk. Thus it would hardly be a surprise if the Government were someday forced to choose between turning a blind eye toward the United States Energy Corporation's machinations or buying up surplus Russian uranium fuel at the taxpayers' risk.
Would Washington invest billions of dollars to keep the fissionable material flowing out of Russia? In a letter to Senator John Glenn, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Energy Secretary Federico F. Pena assured him that "if problems arise the Administration will not hesitate to add or replace executive agents" -- longhand for "yes."
But Mr. Falkenrath is skeptical. "How likely is Congress to appropriate money to buy Russian uranium that had, in effect, been dumped by a privatized U.S.E.C.," he asked?
If economists believe there is trouble looming down the road, so apparently do the Energy Corporation's investment bankers. After subtracting the value of uranium inventories that the corporation will retain and adding debts it will carry, the corporation's advisers estimated that the Government would realize between $1.15 and $1.45 billion from the public offering -- just four or five years' profit, projecting from the corporation's fiscal performance in recent years.
Just how would the taxpayers be better off selling U.S.E.C. at five times earnings rather than banking the cash flow? "It beats me," said a frustrated Representative Ted Strickland, a Democrat who represents the Ohio district where one of the corporation's two plants is situated.

A Wall Not Yet Built Casts the Shadow of Racism

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: USTI NAD LABEM, Czech Republic

 BODY:
On the outskirts of this depressed industrial town, about 50 Gypsy families live in two dilapidated, graffiti-strewn apartment blocks along Maticni Street where voices are often loud and celebrations boisterous.
Across the street, stand three prim row houses with gray facades and white lace curtains drawn across the windows. These are the homes of Czech families who have persuaded the City Council to build a 15-foot-wall on the Gypsy side of Maticni Street to separate the Czechs, physically and psychologically, from what they consider their undesirable neighbors. 
 The Gypsies and several Czech human rights groups have called the wall an attempt to create a ghetto. They declare that the project is the latest example of designating the Gypsies, who number between 200,000 and 300,000, as outsiders in the Czech Republic, which has a population of about 10 million.
The Mayor, Ladislav Hruska, makes no apologies.
"This wall is about one group that obeys the laws of the Czech Republic and behaves according to good morals, and about a group that breaks these rules -- doesn't pay rent, doesn't use proper hygiene and doesn't do anything right," Mr. Hruska said as he sat in his office below a portrait of President Vaclav Havel, a prominent spokesman for human rights.
"This is not a racial problem. It is a problem of dealing with decent and indecent people."
In the last several years, the Czech Government -- once widely considered the leader in Central Europe in the transition from Communist rule, which ended in 1989, to a civil society -- has come under increasing criticism for its failure to address the growing disparities between Gypsies and non-Gypsies.
The most recent United States State Department report on human rights around the world gave vivid details of how Gypsies, also called Romany or Roma, "suffer disproportionately from poverty, unemployment, interethnic violence, discrimination, illiteracy and disease." Unemployment among Gypsies is about 70 percent, the report said.
After Usti nad Labem announced that the wall would be built, Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey and co-chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, criticized the Czech Cabinet for remaining silent in the face of continuing attacks and discrimination against Gypsies and other minorities. The only criticism of the wall by a Czech Government official so far has come from the Minister Without Portfolio, Vladimir Mlynar, who is responsible for Gypsy affairs.
Representative Smith attributed the Government's silence in part to politics. Public opinion polls have consistently shown that Czechs harbor what the State Department report called a "deeply ingrained popular prejudice against Gypsies," and Czech politicians, like all others, keep a close eye on opinion polls.
The prejudice, of course, is felt acutely among the Gypsies of Maticni Street.
"I don't understand how three families have more sway than 50 families," said Miroslav Demeter, 44, as he looked over at the austere facades across the narrow street. "The wall will make things worse. The Romany are very angry, because all over Europe they are breaking down walls but here they are building walls."
Mr. Demeter and several other Gypsies acknowledged that all was not perfect at the apartment houses. It was true, he said, that many families did not pay rent to the city. It was also true, said Tibor Badi, 48, that some families used the surrounding gardens as a refuse heap.
"I was standing on my veranda smoking a cigarette one day and I was almost hit by a falling chair," he said, when one tenant decided to discard the chair by throwing it out the window.
Complicating the issue is that the Gypsy community is quite diverse.
It includes families like Mr. Badi's, who have held jobs for many years and who lived during the Communist period alongside Czechs in integrated housing. High school certificates on the living room wall in Mr. Badi's apartment attest to the education that he and his wife, Marta, received under Communism.
But other Gypsy families here have little education, have rarely held full-time jobs and show contempt for the better educated like Mr. Badi.
At the bar U Pristavu on the corner of Maticni Street, the owner, Eva Kompertova, says she allows in only certain Gypsies.
"I let in three families -- they don't make any trouble -- but I don't let the others in because they get into fights," Ms. Kompertova said as she sipped a beer with some Czech customers. "On our side of the street, Romanies are not allowed. They don't even go over there because it's so clean they feel uncomfortable."
After a meeting with Gypsies from the apartment houses, Mayor Hruska agreed to postpone construction of the wall to September. In the meantime, the Gypsies are being asked to keep the area clean and reduce the noise level. But Mr. Hruska said he did not believe the Gypsies would meet the required standard.
Mr. Demeter, who was tending a newly planted garden, was not optimistic either. "In three months you can't change things," he said. "It's the culture. Romany people are different."
In Prague, a human rights advocate at the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, Marta Mikluskova, said it was essential that the City Council drop the plan. "If Usti is allowed to build a wall, it will become a precedent for other towns," she said, "and others will start planning and do it within a year or two."

HEADLINE: Labor's Abuse of the City

 BODY:
The construction workers who clashed with police and tied up midtown Manhattan for hours on Tuesday turned a lawful rally against the use of nonunion contractors into an illegal assault on civic life. No union, or its members, should be allowed to take the constitutional right to protest and turn it into a license to paralyze the city and rough up civilians and police officers.
Union leaders have issued an apology and offered restitution for injury and property damage. But their statements seemed so grudging and mechanical that the rank and file could easily conclude that their leaders were really winking at their misconduct. If the unions repeat their roughhouse tactics, arrests and heavy fines will be warranted. 
 Locally and nationally, unions are becoming more aggressive in asserting their interests. That is all to the good in a democratic society. But Tuesday's lawlessness pushed the issue that prompted the rally offstage. The rally's main sponsor, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, believes that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority erred in selecting Roy Kay Inc., a nonunion contractor from Freehold, N.J., as the lowest responsible bidder for a $32.6 million project.
In the unions' eyes, city and state laws governing the award of contracts on publicly financed projects to the lowest responsible bidder fail to adequately define what "responsible" means. The unions would like the city and state to adopt legislation that would require bidders to meet new financial, safety and performance criteria in order to be deemed responsible. They have also submitted evidence suggesting that Roy Kay intentionally misled state officials about safety and wage issues. Such charges should be thoroughly investigated by responsible officials, not adjudicated on the streets by lawless demonstrators eager to bully city and state agencies into using only union contractors.
The real issue in Tuesday's demonstration was who will get jobs on publicly financed projects. In a rebounding city economy, unions want as many projects as possible to go to companies that use union crews. Public agencies, most of which already rely heavily on union contractors, want to hold down construction costs. Awarding contracts to the lowest responsible bidders, some of whom may be nonunion contractors, is a means to that end.
If the unions want to change the legal requirements for a "responsible" bidder, they should do so through the normal political process. Although they poured plenty of energy into their street demonstrations Tuesday, not one union raised the issue during the authority's board meeting that same day.

HEADLINE: A Warning From the Fed

 BODY:
Banks are lending out cash a bit too easily, with too little regard for the risks that will come if the economy stumbles into recession. So says the Federal Reserve in an unusual letter sent to all banks last week and released to the public this week.
That the Fed should be worried about easy credit now is merely the latest indication that the American economy is out of sync with many other world economies. Most of Asia is in the midst of a severe credit crunch, as suddenly cautious banks try to get back the money they were lending out so willingly as recently as last year. 
 The Fed's letter, based on a detailed analysis of a sample of loans made by large banks across the country last year, falls well short of an indictment of bank lending practices. But the tone is one of caution, and there are specific warnings that credit standards may have slipped in certain areas, among them loans to real estate investment trusts and media companies. The Fed is also concerned that banks may be charging too little on loans to corporate customers. It is a concern that some top bankers privately say is warranted.
To the extent the Fed's warnings are taken to heart by bankers, the letter might serve as a mild drag on the American economy, something some Fed officials would like to see. The Fed has been unwilling to accomplish that through the usual means, raising interest rates, because of concerns that such a move would exacerbate the Asian economic crisis. No one was surprised that this week's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee ended without a decision to raise or lower rates.
In good times bankers vie to make loans, and are sometimes willing to use overly optimistic assumptions to justify those loans both to management and to regulators. Then, after errors become apparent, bankers grow too cautious, as may be happening now in Asia. If the Fed's letter does help to hold down excessive optimism now, it could help to reduce or forestall the pain that will be felt if the American economy does suffer a setback.

Sorry, You're Still Too Old To Join Force

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
THOUGH starting over is never easy, Michael J. Rosati said that for him the choice was easy. He had always wanted to be a police officer and suddenly it seemed that he might have the chance.
Thanks to the advent of laser surgery, Mr. Rosati was finally able to have his disqualifying nearsightedness corrected. At the same time, thanks to a fight in Congress, the longstanding age limits on becoming a New York City police officer had been suspended. 
 And so, at age 44, Mr. Rosati took the Police Department's written exam and received a high score. He proceeded to pass the background check, the psychological exam and the physical. He was told that he could enter the Police Academy on April 15, 1997, once he had sold his karate school in Franklin Square. So he sold his store.
Then, just four days before the start of classes, he was informed that the age limits had been reinstated. No over-age applicants would be admitted.
"It was like having a lottery number that wins and you lose the ticket," he said the other day.
The injustice, not to say the pathos, of Mr. Rosati's story and a few dozen like it convinced the City Council that an exception should be made. Earlier this year, the Council wrote a law specifically allowing him and about 40 other older candidates their chance to enter the Police Academy.
Yet when Mr. Rosati showed up to try to register for the academy yesterday at 7 A.M., he and the other candidates over 35 were all turned away at the door.
"I don't want to say it's humiliating, but it is embarrassing," Mr. Rosati said after finding himself once again shut out. "It's very frustrating."
Mr. Rosati's hopes are yet another casualty of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's rigorous interpretation of his duties or, if you prefer, his obstinacy.
From the beginning, the Mayor made it abundantly clear that he did not support the cause of the over-age police officers and did not feel an exemption should be made for them.
Though Mr. Giuliani's own celebrated truculence has, it is said, launched a thousand lawsuits, the Mayor maintained that he was extremely worried about opening the city to litigation. If these 40 candidates were grandfathered in, other over-age candidates would, he insisted, use it as an excuse to bring lawsuits against the city and overturn the age limit entirely.
City Council members rejected his argument as legally dubious, noting that exemptions to rules are made all the time for small groups of people who, for one reason or another, seem to deserve special consideration.
While Council members said they agreed with the Mayor that age was a factor in policing, they pointed out that these candidates had acted in good faith, giving up positions, selling businesses and putting considerable strains on their families.
"These people changed their lives and left their jobs," said Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for the City Council. "Look, we did this legislation because we felt it was just a question of fairness."
WHEN the Council approved the exemption in April, Mr. Giuliani promptly vetoed it. Last month, the Council overrode his veto by a vote of 43 to 4. Three of the Council's seven Republican members broke publicly with the Mayor to vote with the majority.
Not willing to accept this clear and apparently straightforward legislative defeat, the litigation-fearing Mr. Giuliani sued the City Council himself. In papers filed in State Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Mayor argues that the Council's action represents an illegal infringement on executive authority.
Though Mr. Giuliani did not seek an injunction, he clearly instructed the Police Commissioner to lock out the slowly dwindling group of over-age candidates.
Along with Mr. Rosati, Paul Agli, 42, got up early yesterday morning, hoping that despite the Mayor's opposition he would be allowed into the Police Academy. For his shot at joining the force, Mr. Agli had given up a job as a research technician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center last year and found himself unemployed for almost 12 months.
It was, Mr. Agli said yesterday, a painful business to watch the doors close in his face. And not just because he himself was being kept out.
"Seeing the police violate the law is very disheartening," he said. "Either this is out of the ordinary or I am very naive."

HEADLINE: Two States Outline Sanctions on Swiss Banks in Holocaust Case

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
New York and California outlined sanctions yesterday against two Swiss banks, after negotiations collapsed over how much money the banks and Swiss Government will return to Holocaust survivors and heirs.
Despite State Department objections, Treasurer Matt Fong of California said his state would not do any more business with two banks, Credit Suisse and UBS. 
 The New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, and the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said they would outline this morning a series of sanctions that would begin taking effect in 45 to 60 days unless a settlement was reached.
The decisions were made after all sides of the dispute had spent a day before a committee of state and local finance officials who had until now recommended holding off sanctions, because the talks had appeared headed toward a settlement.
In New York the first step is most likely to be the rejection of bids for overnight deposits of surplus Government money, followed by banning the banks from underwriting Government bonds. Ultimately the state and city pension funds could sell their shares of Swiss companies. The funds are the second and third largest public employees' pension funds in the country, with combined assets of $188 billion.
The three officials, as well as others from Pennsylvania and Delaware, said at City Hall in Manhattan they would recommend to 800 other state and local finance officials that they begin applying sanctions to prod the Swiss Government into joining new negotiations.
"My impression is that the sides are not that far apart and that the problem is with the Swiss Government," Mr. Hevesi said.
Credit Suisse and UBS proposed last month to put $600 million in a "rough justice fund" to help Holocaust survivors, in addition to paying whatever sums a commission led by Paul A. Volcker determined were due based on bank records.
The plaintiffs proposed last week to settle for $1.5 billion, provided that the Swiss Government and the Swiss National Bank joined in the agreement, Mel Weiss, a lawyer from New York who represents the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said outside the closed session.
The $1.5 billion is far less than lawyers for survivors and heirs, and for charities designated to represent those who died heirless, have been seeking. Those people were engaged in a two-step process in which a settlement would first be made with the commercial banks and then the talks would to the Swiss Government.
The banks and Government said that sanctions were not warranted and that imposing them would make it more difficult to settle the case.
"We will review all of our options," Roger Witten, a lawyer from Washington who is the lead negotiator for the banks, said. "But a gun at our head is not conducive to progress in these negotiations."
"State and local sanctions in this matter are wrong both in principle and practice," Under Secretary of State Stuart E. Eizenstat said in a statement to the officials. Mr. Eizenstat later said he hoped that "the parties will resume their talks as soon as possible in a noncoercive atmosphere."
Mr. Hevesi said the impasse "gives us no choice" but to begin taking business from the banks to prod them and the Government to settle.

HEADLINE: Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady Amid Signs of Cooling

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
With signs of a slowing economy and increasing evidence that the Asian economic crisis is beginning to hurt some industries in the United States, the Federal Reserve today decided not to raise interest rates.
Following a two-day private meeting, the Fed said that it was keeping the benchmark Federal funds rate -- the borrowing cost on overnight loans between banks -- steady at 5.5 percent, just where it has been since March 1997. 
 At the same time, other indicators were released today that gave a picture of an economy cooling down from the hectic pace of the last year or so. A key index of manufacturing activity, the monthly purchasing managers' report, fell in June for the first time in two years. This index measures manufacturing production and its sharp decline from 51.4 in May to 49.6 in June was seen as evidence that the Asian economic turmoil is starting to affect American industrial producers.
The Commerce Department also reported today that construction slumped 1.5 percent in May, the worst drop in more than four years, and the Conference Board's indicator of future economic activity remained unchanged from April to May, at 105.2. This is the second consecutive month that the Conference Board's leading indicator stayed fixed, a sign that the economy, while still on a positive track, is expected to be sluggish.
"When you have an economy where inflation is low and the economy is slowing, there is no reason for the Fed to raise rates," said Stan Shipley, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "And the three indicators also released today indicate that this economy is weakening and weakening rapidly. We think that by December we may begin to see unemployment rise and retail sales fall and then the Fed will have to vote to lower rates."
A number of analysts argue that the economy, after a period of relative weakness, could well rebound in the months ahead and see little reason for the Fed to cut short-term interest rates. Still, Merrill Lynch's view was echoed by others. "A good case is building that the Fed might need to lower interest rates," said James Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Securities. "The dislocations that were caused by the Asia shock are starting to ripple through the U.S. economy and we are beginning to see lots of indications that economic growth is slowing down."
For months, the American economy has been largely insulated from the Asian downturn. In fact, consumers have benefited in many ways from lower prices for imported goods and from lower lending costs caused in part by Asia's crisis. That has helped curb inflation. But some domestic producers have begun to suffer from reduced demand for American goods in Asia and from the intense price competition from cheaper overseas products.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said he was particularly troubled by the drop in the index of manufacturing activity. "The purchasing managers' index is something the Fed watches closely, and the numbers that came out today were significant," he said. "Our manufacturing sector is weakening because of the problems in Asia."
The Fed has stayed its hand even though monetary policy makers have leaned, ever since their meeting in March, toward raising rates in a bid to slow down what some feared was an overripe economy. (The Fed has long raised interest rates as a way of halting inflation, and lowered them when it wanted to stimulate the economy.)
But, since the beginning of the year, inflation has, if anything, retreated even further and is now running at an annual rate of under 1.8 percent. In addition, Fed policy makers are worried that raising United States rates could touch off more financial turbulence in Asia.
"Asia's misfortune is allowing us to enjoy a strong economy here with low inflation," Mr. Yardeni said. "While the Fed might see that strong economy as a threat to reviving inflation, they recognize that's not much of a risk right now. What's really important in these numbers is that we are seeing a weakening price environment for manufacturers."
Currently, many analysts expect that the hot growth rate of 5.4 percent that took place in the first quarter of the year could slow to around 2 percent -- or even lower -- for the rest of the year as manufacturers and retailers work off excessive inventories that have built up in recent months.
In light of these estimates, the Fed warned banks on Tuesday against lowering their lending standards on business loans. In a statement, the Fed said bankers should resist any tendency to assume "that the unusually favorable economic environment of the last few years will continue indefinitely."
A glimpse into the internal reasoning of the Fed may come on Thursday when the Open Market Committee releases the minutes of its May 19 meeting.

HEADLINE: In AT&T-TCI Deal, Cost and Logistical Problems

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 1

 BODY:
Sometime before the end of the century, high-speed Internet access and low-cost phone calls alike will make their way into American homes as streams of digital 1's and 0's over television cables.
But in recent days, as executives of AT&T and Tele-Communications Inc. have scrambled to sell Wall Street and the American consumer on the wisdom of their ambitious $31.8 billion merger, one fact has become clear: The technology will tread a costly path on its way from the laboratory into the home. 
 In addition to the $1.8 billion TCI will spend to upgrade its one-way cable network to a two-way service capable of carrying digital video and sound to its 10.5 million customers, AT&T will need to persuade customers to buy advanced set-top boxes that have connectors for video, computer and telephone, and it will have to install a new generation of advanced Internet routers capable of offering clear voice quality, at its own expense.
So, beyond that first $1.8 billion, the final cost for the entire project could run another $10 billion or more based on an initial per-customer cost of $750. That cost could eventually fall as low as $200 per customer sometime after 2000.
The actual amount will vary depending on what percentage of households decide to switch service from their existing phone company and on how quickly the cost of new Internet telephone technology falls.
But even assuming that the cost of the AT&T-TCI plan allows any real price competition on telephone calls, consumers will face sundry logistical problems once the digital telephones arrive in their homes. For example, most set-top boxes are in living rooms -- the one room often not wired for a telephone.
None of this fazes David Nagel, AT&T's unflappable chief technology officer, who points out that the nation's largest phone company has a decade's worth of experience working with the cable industry on the challenges of digital telephony.
"Our guys have crawled all over the cable networks, and the problems are very solvable," he said.
Indeed, AT&T has been welcomed as a conquering hero by the cable industry, which five years ago promised a future of 500 channels and interactive television only to back off when daunting costs and consumer apathy dulled that vision with a stubborn coating of reality.
"I don't care if it takes five years, AT&T is going to make this work," said Paul Kagan, president of Paul Kagan & Associates, a cable industry research firm in Carmel, Calif. Alluding to TCI's chairman -- and the the cable industry's most ambitious salesman -- he added, "There's more here than John Malone trying to make his stock go up."
While he acknowledges that a steep investment lies ahead and several technical challenges must be overcome, others are less sanguine.
"What I've found with technology is that C.E.O.'s don't have a clue about what really needs to be done," said Andrew Seybold, a computer and communications industry analyst and publisher of Andrew Seybold's Outlook, a newsletter based in Boulder Creek, Calif. "The problem is that the technology always takes longer than people expect."
Mr. Seybold worries particularly about reliability, citing the aftermath of California's Northridge earthquake in January 1994. While telephone service was restored in 24 to 48 hours, he said, cable did not begin to come back for a week and in some cases two months.
Here in the San Francisco region, TCI's largest service area, with 1.5 million customers, roughly 10 percent of subscribers have been upgraded to two-way cables. The company says that figure will be 50 percent by the end of the year and 90 percent by the end of the century.
For each city it serves, the first step in an upgrade is for engineers to cover every inch of the network on foot looking for older, one-way amplifiers that must be replaced with two-way equipment.
Next, the placement of fiber nodes -- the intersection points where fiber optic cables meet the coaxial cables that stretch past each home -- is adjusted to a ratio of approximately one for every 500 to 1,000 homes.
This makes the network more resistant to large-scale failures and reduces the capacity requirements for the digital networks that will carry data, voice and video.
Finally, equipment will be added to the central cable plant, or "head end," that will connect the thousands of homes to the Internet and, in some cases, to traditional telephone networks.
In the San Francisco area, switching from today's cables to a digital system promises significant cost savings for the network. TCI owns a powerful fiber optic ring that encircles the Bay Area, which it now uses to distribute television programming. In the future, the huge capacity of that network will make it possible for AT&T to economically centralize its switching and routing equipment.
Once the network is in place in each city, AT&T will immediately be able to offer old-fashioned "circuit switched" telephone service over the cable system.
However, by the fall of 1999, a second generation of cable boxes should be available through consumer electronics outlets nationwide. Based on a yet-to-be determined standard, these boxes will permit the complete integration of voice, data and video. But instead of using circuit switching, which requires a separate copper-wire path for each call, these will employ "packet switching," which allows many kinds of information, including telephone calls, to travel down the same wire at the same time.
It is at that point, industry analysts say, that AT&T will begin to realize the cost savings that will permit competition with local phone companies, plus a range of new services, including CD-quality music and distinctive ringing tones for each member of the family.
Moreover, Mr. Kagan said, the phone company has a powerful financial weapon as it buys its way into these converged technologies: the cable franchises will remain monopolies.
"One of the secrets of this whole deal," he said, "is that AT&T is going to make a bunch of money offering traditional cable television."

Currently, consumers get cable, telephone and Internet services over different types of transmission lines. By acquiring TCI, AT&T hopes to offer these services over one transmission line, using TCI's existing cables. Here is how it would work.

HEADLINE: In Seoul, Too, Rubin Urges Japan to Move on Economy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 1

 BODY:
On the last stop of his six-day, four-country sweep of Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin made his most pointed comments about a country that he did not even visit, Japan.
The Japanese economy was clearly on Mr. Rubin's mind as he met South Korean business, labor and political leaders for a report on the country's economic overhaul. 
 He stressed again and again the "enormous importance of getting Japan back on track to support growth in Korea and the region in general." Mr. Rubin said he was "deeply, deeply concerned" about the recent slide of the yen against the dollar.
But he dodged questions about whether the United States would again step in to prop up the yen with the standard response that the United States would move if and when it deemed that intervention was necessary.
And on the eve of the disclosure of Japan's latest plan to overhaul its financial system, Mr. Rubin exhorted Japanese officials to come up with a credible solution. "The most important key with respect to economic conditions in Japan is to restructure its banking system in an efficient fashion that wins the approval of the world financial markets," he said.
His decision not to include Japan on his trip, but nonetheless to talk a great deal about it, has been a subject of intense discussion in Asia, where Japan's inability to devise a plan to put its economy back on track is seen as prolonging the region's woes.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Clinton's detours around Japan are widely regarded as a snub to one of the United States' most devoted allies and have raised wide-ranging speculation here about a realignment of American interests.
In his meeting today with Mr. Rubin, President Kim Dae Jung wondered aloud whether the United States and China were forging a "special relationship," a heavily veiled expression of concern that most Asian countries have about how China's power will grow.
"I wouldn't characterize it that way," Mr. Rubin told Mr. Kim, although he added that Mr. Clinton had long regarded better relations between the United States and China as important.
In a day capped by a somber visit to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, Mr. Rubin met President Kim and business and labor leaders in hopes of improving his understanding of the issues confronting Korea as its sweeping efforts to reform its economy begin to bite.
The more radical of the two labor confederations gave him a stern lecture on the evils of the International Monetary Fund's rescue program, which includes maintaining high interest rates and introducing greater flexibility in the labor market.
Those two factors are faulted for pushing companies into bankruptcy at the rate of 3,000 a month and putting 1.6 million people out of work.
Mr. Rubin said the participants in the meeting understood the need for broad-based support for reform in spite of the immediate pain. "They were concerned that every sector of the economy bear a share of the pain," he said.
In an attempt to assess that, he met the heads of four of the five largest conglomerates, the Daewoo, Hyundai, Samsung and LG groups, and a senior representative of the fifth group, SK, whose chairman, Chey Jong Hyun, was ill.
Government and other analysts are impatient with the large groups' efforts to change. But in their meeting today they did express their commitment to reform, although the head of Daewoo, Kim Woo Choong, avoided directly answering Mr. Rubin's question about whether the groups would reduce their debt-to-equity ratios to 2 to 1 by the end of the year, according to people at the meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Mr. Kim of Daewoo urged Mr. Rubin to do what he could to further the imports and sales of Korean cars in the United States. The Korean automobile business is running at 40 percent of capacity, because of virtually nonexistent domestic demand and stiffer competition from Japanese manufacturers, who have been helped by the weaker yen.
Mr. Rubin also met representatives of small and midsize enterprises who pleaded with him to advocate lower interest rates, according to those at the meeting. Interest rates on corporate debt have fallen, to 16 percent for three-year notes from highs of 28 to 30 percent when the crisis hit in December.
Mr. Rubin reiterated American support for South Korea, pledging to back additional lending from international sources. But he added that he saw no need for such additional lending, because Korea has $39 billion in foreign currency reserves.
He also noted that the United States went through many of the same painful adjustments that Korea is experiencing before it emerged as the world's economic powerhouse.
"We made a lot of mistakes," he said, "and there's a lot to be learned from our mistakes."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
The Japanese Stock Market Extends Its Rally to 7 Days

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, July 2

 BODY:
The Japanese stock market extended its rally today for the seventh consecutive day, on expectations that the Government's plan for cleaning up the nation's bad bank loans will spur an economic revival.
The yen has also been rising. This morning it cost 138.15 yen to buy a dollar in Tokyo, compared with a level of 145 a couple of weeks ago. 
 The centerpiece of the Government's plan is the use of so-called bridge banks to take over the business of failed institutions so that creditworthy borrowers would not be left in the lurch if their main bank goes under.
The success of the plan is by no means certain. But for the last few days, investors have begun to raise their hopes that it might actually start to chip away large chunks of the nation's bad and doubtful debt, estimated to be at least $560 billion.
There is a growing sense that because of world pressure the governing Liberal Democratic Party and the Government are addressing the problem, although some of the effort is timed to their campaigning for parliamentary elections on July 12.
"We think it's real," said Richard Medley, a principal of the New York-based Medley Global Advisors, after talking with Japanese politicians in Tokyo this week. "These guys realize that the pain of delaying reform is actually worse than the pain of reform."
The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 328.52 points, or more than 2 percent, to 16,691.41, at the midday recess early today. The index has risen in the last seven days, with volumes surging. Reports that the Government might also permanently cut income taxes by nearly $30 billion have sent investors into the market.
"I think what's happened is you've got this policy machine, and it's working pretty well -- they've really got it together," said Craig Chudler, a strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. "Portfolio investors have become less negative. Instead of being super-negative, they're just negative."
The bridge bank plan will give extensive powers to two Government bodies, the Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Financial Supervisory Agency, a new agency of about 400 people spun off from the Finance Ministry last month to inspect the banks. As each institution fails, its business will be transferred to a bridge bank, which will be set up under the Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Initially, the Deposit Insurance Corporation will draw on public funds from the bank bailout in February of 30 trillion yen, or $217 billion, some of which has already been disbursed to the nation's largest banks to increase their capital.
In practice, the Supervisory Agency will play the pivotal role in the plan. One critical question will be whether it can hire qualified people and expand enough to accomplish the task. It will essentially be in charge of closing insolvent institutions and appointing new management teams to run the business of the failed banks.
It will also determine which loans in the failed bank are bad and which are good. Then it will transfer the bad loans to the Resolution and Collection Bank, another entity set up to collect bad loans, and transfer the good loans to the bridge bank, which then may extend loans to those borrowers as a bridge until they find a new banker.
Critics have argued that any bailout plan will create a moral hazard, in which private institutions have little incentive to improve because they think they will be rescued by the Government. Partly to prevent this, the bridge banks are expected to last about two years, during which time they are expected to find financially healthy banks to take on the restructured business.
This period could be extended up to five years. After that, any bad debt still left will be transferred to the Resolution and Collection Bank, and the bridge bank will be dissolved.

HEADLINE: SUHARTO REBUILDS HIS POLITICAL BASE TO SHIELD FORTUNE

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Suharto, the former President of Indonesia, is maneuvering to re-establish a political power base to shield his family's financial empire from scrutiny by future Governments, according to Clinton Administration officials and Western diplomats.
There is no direct evidence that the Suharto family has tried to bribe political or military leaders, the officials say. But they add that Mr. Suharto and his six children are offering to underwrite the political campaigns of legislators who vow loyalty to the family, which has a fortune in the billions of dollars. 
 Administration officials and diplomats agree that Mr. Suharto does not appear to be seeking reinstatement as President. He resigned in May after thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Indonesia's largest cities demanding his ouster.
Instead, they say, intelligence reports reaching the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and the Defense Department show that he is making use of his riches and his ties to the military to help his children retain their businesses and their top posts in the ruling political party, at a time when the political moorings of Indonesia are fraying.
Next week the party, known as Golkar, is holding a special national congress to pick new leaders.
Mr. Suharto remains chairman of the party's board of patrons, and two of his children have been appointed to the seven-member organizing committee for the congress. Four of his children are members of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly.
That Mr. Suharto, 77, retains close ties to the military, the nation's most powerful institution, was in evidence in June when he accompanied several powerful army generals to Islamic prayers in military mosques in Jakarta.
"Suharto has been very active, rounding up support wherever he can find it," said a senior Clinton Administration official.
Another Administration official said Mr. Suharto "knows that he can't be president again, but he is going to make sure that his kids and his cash survive whatever comes."
Daniel Lev, a professor of political science at the University of Washington and an expert on Indonesia, said the Suhartos "are doing what comes very naturally: they have the wherewithal to buy political support, and I suspect that is in fact what they are trying to do."
Despite the collapse of the Indonesian currency, the Suharto family is still among the richest on earth.
After his resignation on May 21, Mr. Suharto went into seclusion for a few weeks, rarely emerging from his Jakarta home and seeing few visitors apart from his six children. He was reported to be depressed and shocked at his ouster after 32 years of iron-fisted rule.
But diplomats in Jakarta and Administration officials with access to intelligence reports say that his isolation is over and that he has worked aggressively behind the scenes to restore his contacts with political, military and religious leaders.
His family appears eager, they say, to influence next week's selection of Golkar's new leaders, who in turn will control the actions of the party's 325 members in the 500-seat House of Representatives and the selection of the party's candidates in the next national election.
While the House of Representatives has been a rubber stamp for the President in the past, the recent political chaos in Indonesia suggests that it may not be in the future. "The Suhartos want to buy up the loyalty of as many legislators as they can," a Clinton Administration official said. "It's their best hope for survival."
Rumors that Mr. Suharto would seek a return to public life -- and might even try to take power again as President with the help of the army -- have swirled through Jakarta virtually since the day he stepped down.
Military leaders have been forced to deny publicly that they are helping him return to power.
At a news conference on Monday, General Wiranto, the armed forces commander, acknowledged that he and other senior officers remained "close" to President Suharto. But Gen. Wiranto insisted that the situation does not "imply the existence of secret or hidden ties," nor that the military would help Mr. Suharto return to the presidency.
Mr. Suharto was succeeded by his Vice President, B. J. Habibie. While Mr. Habibie was considered a protege of the former President, it is unclear what sort of relationship exists between the two today.
In recent weeks President Habibie has taken some actions that appear to be favors to his predecessor, including his decision last month to dismiss Attorney General Sujono Atmonegoro after Mr. Atmonegoro announced that he was organizing an investigation of the wealth of former government officials, apparently including Mr. Suharto.
But other actions by Mr. Habibie appear to be snubs.

HEADLINE: Keeping 'em Down on the Farm;
Sales of Development Rights Preserve Agrarian Land

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: RED HOOK, N.Y.

 BODY:
Fraleighs have been farming the land here ever since John Adams was President, forming part of an enduring rustic tapestry of grazing cows, languid country roads and trees sagging with fruit.
Yet discouraging economics and mounting debts have at times forced Dave Fraleigh, an apple and peach grower, to ponder some distasteful strategies. Two or three years ago, he looked into the possibility of selling part of his land to suburban-style developers the way farmers have done all over the nation. 
 He also considered turning the farm into an agrarian Disneyland, inviting the public to pick their own fruit and gawk at the vanishing ways of farmers. But he rejected that, too.
"I enjoy growing fruit; I don't enjoy being in entertainment," Mr. Fraleigh said, chatting with some visitors as his two Labrador retrievers snoozed in the midday shade.
Now, Mr. Fraleigh has been able to shrug off such possibilities because a white knight in June paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars to bind himself to farm his 125 acres until he retires, then pass it on to another farmer.
For Mr. Fraleigh, the instant infusion of cash will allow him to pay off debt and buy 93 more acres. For Red Hook, it may mean something far more valuable: one more lasting farm to help sustain a rural sense of place far into the future.
The white knight, in Mr. Fraleigh's case, was an environmental group called Scenic Hudson, but similar programs have existed in 20 states for many years. Local and state governments and private preservation trusts have been buying development rights to farmland, permanently limiting the use of the land to agriculture, as a way of sustaining their locales' pastoral character.
What makes Scenic Hudson's program noteworthy is that rather than preserving farms scattershot, the organization is spending $2.5 million to preserve a cluster of seven Red Hook farms with 1,000 acres -- 16 percent of the town's farmland -- on the theory that a rural area needs a critical mass of farms to resist development pressures. Mr. Fraleigh, 44, a stocky man with bulky, sunburned shoulders, said he would not have kept a farm if everyone around him had sold out.
"I didn't want to have a farm in the middle of suburbia," said Mr. Fraleigh (FRAY-lee), who does not yet know whether his three young children -- Peter, 10; Steven, 8, and Sarah, 5 -- will want to farm. "Tractors running at 3 o'clock in the morning aren't popular with neighbors."
What the government and private preservationists do is have farmland appraised for what it would be worth on the open market, then for what it would be worth if it could be used only as farmland. They pay the farmer the difference, sometimes more than 50 percent of a parcel's value.
For instance, if land in Dutchess County is worth $5,000 an acre unencumbered but only $3,000 if limited to farming, then the farmer would be paid $2,000 an acre. The farmer keeps the land, but unless a court intervenes, the deed to the farm is restricted with a conservation easement, a provision that forever prohibits residential or commercial development.
A program pioneered 25 years ago by Suffolk County and its municipalities has preserved more than 8,000 acres of farmland, mostly in the East End, against the enticements of bankers and entertainers seeking to build weekend homes. In an area like the Hamptons, where a 65-acre oceanfront farm recently went to a developer for $11 million, the Peconic Land Trust sometimes uses less expensive variations on a theme -- like encouraging farmers to contribute their land to the trust in exchange for substantial tax benefits.
New York State, a relative latecomer with a program less than three years old, is now spending $5 million for farmland preservation, providing grants to selected municipalities willing to shoulder 75 percent of the cost of development rights.
New Jersey, which started its program in 1973, has spent $168 million preserving 234 farms, and Connecticut has spent $75 million on protecting 169 farms. Some of the programs make use of a $35 million Federal pot of matching funds created in 1996.
Land preservationists like Joseph Gergela, executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau, make the argument that buying up farmland can end up saving taxpayers money. A single farm requires schooling, police and other services for only one family. A residential development on that same acreage can require services for scores of families.
A 1989 study by Scenic Hudson found that Red Hook spent $1.11 in services for every $1 in tax revenue generated by residential development. By contrast, when farmland or other open land was involved, the town spent 22 cents in services for every dollar it received in revenue.
To understand how important such programs are, it is necessary to grasp what they are battling against. Nationally, one million acres of the country's 945 million acres of farmland are swallowed up every year, transformed into homes and malls, according to the American Farmland Trust, a conservation group.
Southern Dutchess County, now about an hour and 15 minute drive from the New York City line, was not too long ago a sleepy backwater of milk farms and apple orchards. Like Red Hook farther north in the county, it was the kind of place where, as Mr. Fraleigh's wife, Karen, likes to say, "I can't go into the grocery store without running into four people I know on a first-name basis."
But starting in the 1950's, the arrival of two huge I.B.M. plants and the emergence of corporate office parks around White Plains created a thirst for housing, particularly in southern Dutchess. From 1969 to 1995, the last year for which figures are available, one of every four farming acres in Dutchess vanished, leaving 615 farms with 113,000 acres. (Since the 1970's, the number of farms has stayed roughly the same, but bigger farms have been replaced by smaller ones.)
There are no longer dairy farms in towns like East Fishkill and Wappingers Falls that not too long ago had plenty of them.
"Once a farm has been sold, it never comes back," said Dave Tetor, agriculture program leader of Cornell Cooperative Extension in Dutchess County, which furnishes farmers with research.
The downsizing of I.B.M. earlier this decade gave a reprieve to Dutchess's farmers, who generate $409 million a year in sales, but the booming economy has made them brace for the likelihood of another developer onslaught. Anticipating that invasion, Scenic Hudson tapped $2.5 million it received from the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands and used it for buying development rights rather than saving riverside bluffs or marshland, as it usually does.
"The younger generation is seeing the cards stacking up against them," said Steven Rosenberg, Scenic Hudson's director of land preservation. "They'll say: 'What am I going to do? Go into mom and dad's farm or go to business school?' If the cards continue stacking up the way they do, they go to business school."
These permanent conservation easements are not for everyone. Many farmers who expect to retire without heirs who want to farm would rather sell to a developer. Chuck Mead, who owns 105 acres of orchards and hay fields, did not accept Scenic Hudson's initial offer because it was too low, given what he felt is the possibility of Metro-North trains extending up to nearby Tivoli and driving up land prices. In the hope of getting a better price, he has applied for a separate county program that is buying up development rights.
"If I were to sell the land, I wouldn't have any debt," Mr. Mead said, "but I wouldn't have a farm. This way, I can sell part of the value and still continue to farm."
The preservation programs have helped not only landowners like Mr. Fraleigh, but also prospective landowners like John Hardeman.
Mr. Hardeman, 45, a tall, rangy Red Hook native, owns a tiny seven-acre orchard with a roadside produce stand just outside the village center. He could not afford to buy substantial orchard land in Red Hook, where the prospect of development had pushed prices above $5,000 an acre. So in 1989, he bought apple and peach land in Livingston, 15 miles north, and became what he calls "a commuting farmer."
But that commuting may soon be eliminated. In June, Scenic Hudson bought the development rights to most of the farm near the roadside stand, 173 of Dave Lown's 250 acres, sharply diminishing its value to the point that Mr. Hardeman could afford to buy it. "It enables me to return to my roots," Mr. Hardeman said.
Mr. Lown, 70, a fourth-generation farmer, is ready to retire and his son and daughter have no interest in farming. He could have made more money selling the land to a developer, though Red Hook is still too far north for a home builder to appear in the near future. But he says that he is gratified that he can help keep the land the way it is.
"I'd rather see it stay a farm," he said. "I like to look at trees and open land instead of all houses and traffic. It makes for a nice rural area."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Big Victory for the Republican Right

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., July 1

 BODY:
As a battle for the soul of Southern Republicanism, the Alabama primary runoff that Gov. Fob James Jr. won so convincingly on Tuesday reinforced a number of truths about the party and the region. Religious conservatives still wield immense influence. Strong stands against taxes still sell. Race still matters. And even as Southerners take a leading role in national politics, they still deeply resent Federal intrusion.
The result also buttressed a theme drawn from campaigns around the country this year, including the spending spree among Democrats in the race for California governor: money does not always prevail. 
 Governor James was outspent by his challenger, Winton Blount 3d, a wealthy Montgomery businessman, by more than 2 to 1. By financing his campaign heavily with loans from himself and his family, Mr. Blount forced Mr. James to spend twice as much as the Governor had originally budgeted for the primary. But he also handed Mr. James an issue, and the Governor appealed to this poor state's populist sensibilities by using television advertising to mock Mr. Blount's inherited wealth.
Each of those factors played a role in Mr. James's surprisingly decisive victory over Mr. Blount in their hard-fought runoff. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. James had 56 percent of the vote to Mr. Blount's 44 percent. In the general election for governor, Mr. James will now face Lieut. Gov. Don Siegelman, who easily won the Democratic nomination four weeks ago.
The primary campaign probed the inherent tensions in Southern Republicanism, between the conservative Christians drawn to the party, and to Mr. James, by a deeply felt moral agenda, and the business-oriented voters primarily concerned with the state's economic interests. One of Mr. James's chief strategists was Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition. Throughout the region and beyond, the primary was widely seen as a test of the power of the Christian right, less than two years before the Presidential primary season begins.
Mr. Reed himself said that Tuesday's message was clear.
"If you don't backpedal and don't apologize for taking a strong stand for religious freedom," he said, "you will be rewarded at the ballot box."
In the week before Mr. James's triumph, polls showed the race to be a dead heat. But the polls could not measure the enthusiasm of Mr. James's support among white conservatives in rural and suburban counties. Many of those voters were pulled to the polls by last-minute mailings and telephone calls that emphasized the Governor's devotion to religious causes, like his protests against Federal court rulings prohibiting organized prayer in public schools and his defense of a state judge's displaying the Ten Commandments on a courtroom wall.
In the last month, for instance, the Governor's campaign directed three pieces of mail and three telephone calls to each of 90,000 households gleaned from lists of people who had attended rallies supporting that judge, Roy Moore, a James strategist said. Many of the fliers noted Mr. James's support from evangelical leaders like Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and James C. Dobson.
"Anyone who didn't think before that religious conservatives were a big part of the electorate here and the backbone of the Republican Party simply didn't understand Alabama," said State Attorney General Bill Pryor, a Republican.
The polls also did not detect an apparent backlash against the endorsement of Mr. Blount last week by Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. of Birmingham, a black Democrat who urged his supporters to vote in the Republican runoff. An unusual provision allows Alabama voters to participate in a Republican primary runoff regardless of whether they voted in the first primary election, or how.
Mr. James had pursued the Mayor's endorsement himself. But when he did not receive it, his strategists and allies encouraged the backlash by arguing that Mr. Blount would be the captive of "a liberal Democratic political boss" who had demanded a say on appointments and spending.
Television advertisements and mailings produced by the James campaign included photographs of Mr. Arrington. And a flier circulated widely by a black newspaper publisher who supports Mr. James carried a two-decade-old picture of a black Arrington adviser, Donald V. Watkins, with an Afro haircut that had long been shorn.
Mr. James's strategists, who were jubilant about his unexpectedly broad victory, said their advertisements had been designed to raise questions about Mr. Arrington's influence, and not his race. The same tactics would have been used, they said, had Mr. Arrington been white.
But a number of political scientists and strategists, including several Republicans, said today that the advertisements had relied on an implicit racial appeal and that they had worked.
"When you talk about liberal special-interest groups and run pictures of Richard Arrington and Donald Watkins, it's pretty clear which special-interest group you're talking about," said Bradley Moody, an associate professor of political science at Auburn University, Montgomery. "It's not labor unions, and it's not the Alabama Education Association."
Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster from Atlanta who has worked for candidates and lobbying groups in Alabama, said that the endorsement by Mr. Arrington's Jefferson County Citizens Coalition seemed to have driven up turnout in some typically Democratic precincts and that Mr. Blount had benefited from that vote. But, Mr. Ayres said, that was more than offset by increases in rural and suburban counties where white conservatives may have been motivated to vote for Mr. James by the Arrington endorsement. "The initial indications are that the endorsement backfired," Mr. Ayres said. "My sense is that Mr. Blount got on the wrong side of a racial issue."
A Republican strategist who has worked on several statewide campaigns in Alabama put it even more bluntly. "When you play the race card in Alabama, it's over," the strategist said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. James also played effectively, as he has throughout his political life, to an almost visceral sentiment in Alabama's white electorate: a distaste for elites and outside authority. Several analysts said today that his attacks on the Federal judiciary and critical editorial writers, at whom he poked fun in his victory speech on Tuesday night, appealed to his state's oft-wounded pride. In his speech, he spoke of "a spirit that says deep down, 'I'm proud to be from Alabama.' "
Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist who has written extensively on Republican politics in the South, said Mr. James's ability to strike nativist chords was reminiscent of former Gov. George C. Wallace.
"It's the old Confederate thing of winning by losing," he said. "The important thing is making a stand against the odds. Even if he's losing on these religious issues, it still works with voters."
Although concerned about the damage inflicted on Mr. James during a prolonged and nasty primary campaign, Republican leaders were ecstatic about the record number of voters who were drawn. With few runoffs on the Democratic ballot, the Republican election on Tuesday attracted a stunning total of 455,000 voters, shattering the previous mark of 359,000 Republican voters, set in the primary on June 2. That number, in turn, had smashed a record of 215,000 set in 1996.
Mr. James succeeded by expanding his margin of victory over Mr. Blount in rural counties, and by minimizing his losses in cities like Birmingham and Montgomery.
While Mr. James, 63, depleted his war chest in defeating Mr. Blount, Mr. Siegelman, the 52-year-old Democratic nominee, begins the general election campaign with more than $3.5 million. At a news conference today, he wasted little time in opening a two-front offensive.
He continued Mr. Blount's efforts to make the campaign a referendum on Mr. James, describing him at a news conference as "a do-nothing Governor." And he relentlessly promoted his plan to enact a state lottery that would pay for college scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and classroom computers.
Polls show that education is by far the most important issue to Alabama voters. But the lottery, like all forms of gambling, may be a hard sell in a state where evangelical churches play so crucial a role in electoral politics.
The lottery plan permits Mr. Siegelman to propose significant increases in spending without raising taxes, a convenient device against an incumbent who pledges not to raise state taxes of any kind. But Mr. James opposes a lottery, and Mr. Siegelman's gambling initiative is also certain to energize the conservative Christians who form the foundation of the Governor's support.

Easing of Worries on Japan Helps the Dow Top 9,000

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 9,000 yesterday for the first time in three weeks as concerns about Japan eased and Federal Reserve officials left interest rates unchanged.
The index of 30 blue-chip stocks rose 96.65 points, to 9,048.67, a gain of 1.1 percent. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 14.72, or 1.3 percent, to 1,148.56, another record.
"I don't think it was any surprise," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones & Sons, referring to the Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged.
"You cannot fight what you cannot see, and right now we don't see any signs of inflation on the horizon."
Today, Japan's leaders are expected to disclose steps to tackle bad bank loans in a bid to restart their economy. This would help drag Asia out of its slowdown, analysts said.
"The market is reacting today to the rally in Japanese stocks, and the sense that Japanese political leaders are no longer in denial and will do something to spur the economy," Mr. Skrainka said.
Stocks in Japan jumped 3.4 percent overnight, the second day of strong gains, bolstered by a rising yen and optimism about Government plans to deal with the banking crisis.
In Washington, the Fed, the nation's central bank, left interest rates unchanged after a two-day meeting.
Investors' hopes that the worst of the second-quarter profit warnings were out of the way also bolstered sentiment.
In the broader market, advances beat declines by better than 2 to 1 on active New York Stock Exchange volume of 701.6 million shares. The Nasdaq composite index, weighted with technology stocks, rose 19.72, to 1,914.46.
Smaller stocks also rallied, with the Russell 2000 index of small issues adding 2.46, to 459.85.
Internet-related stocks were particularly strong on speculation that AT&T, America Online, CBS and others are shopping for Internet partners. Netscape Communications rose 8 5/8, to 35 11/16, in Nasdaq
trading. Doubleclick jumped 14 5/16, to 64; Yahoo gained 12 3/8, to 169 7/8, and Earthlink Network rose 10 1/4, to 87.
These and other Internet stocks rallied in recent weeks after the Walt Disney Company bought 43 percent of the on-line directory Infoseek.
The At Home Corporation surged 6 3/16, to 53 1/2, after the Internet content company said it had reached agreements with Jones Intercable to offer high-speed Internet service over cable television lines in the Washington area.
Nike gained 3 3/8, to 52 1/16, after the footwear company reported fourth-quarter profit of 4 cents a share, a penny above estimates. Analysts at several brokerage firms raised their rating on the stock.
Hambrecht & Quist Group, a San Francisco investment bank, slumped 2 5/16, to 34, after Credit Suisse First Boston said it had hired Deutsche Bank Securities' three most productive investment bankers. Hambrecht had surged 22 percent Tuesday on speculation that Credit Suisse First Boston would make a takeover offer.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
30-Year Treasury Unchanged As Fed Holds Line on Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday, after, as expected, the Federal Reserve policy-making committee decided not to adjust interest rates.
The 30-year bond closed at a price of 107 6/32, leaving the bond's yield at 5.62 percent.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, attributed the Fed's decision to a slowdown in the economy, subdued inflation, the budget surplus and the malaise in Asia.
Treasury securities opened weaker yesterday after the dollar fell in currency trading. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, who also benefit from the currency translation.
But then a report on manufacturing suggested the economy was slowing. "Indeed, economic data released today clearly indicated a slowing of economic momentum, as exemplified by the sharp decline in the National Association of Purchasing Management index, a fallback in construction spending, and the flattening in the index of leading indicators," Mr. Fine said. The June manufacturing index fell to 49.6 from 51.4 in May, the first time in two years that the level has dropped below 50, a sign of contraction in the industrial sector.
Mr. Fine added that some of the declines in the index were for production, employment and inventories, and while some of the sluggishness may be a result of the strike against the General Motors Corporation, he said, the crisis in Asia was playing a much greater role.
Construction spending tumbled 1.5 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $633.5 billion as private and public sectors registered declines. And the Conference Board's index of leading indicators was unchanged in May for the second consecutive month, which could be signaling slower growth in the third quarter as well as the second quarter.
The Government will report today on the number of jobs added to the economy last month and on the unemployment rate, both of which are capable of moving the market. Estimates of jobs created range from an increase of 125,000 jobs to an increase of 250,000, placing the consensus at about 190,000 new jobs.
Mr. Fine said the average for the number of jobs added to the economy in the last two months has been plus 300,000. "So even if it comes in at the high end of expectations, it is still below the recent average," he said.

HEADLINE: China Still Trails Russia in What Matters Most;
Gorbachev's Vision

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I agree with Robert D. Kaplan (Op-Ed, June 28) that China's gradual approach to modernization has worked better than Russia's. In retrospect, Mikhail S. Gorbachev was correct when he advocated a similar gradualism for Russia, and it is a pity that he lost power and reputation because he would not move quickly toward a free-market economy. 
 Some transitional market distortion and old-guard hegemony would have been a good investment in the controlled growth of an efficient production plant with minimal social disruption. Russia's leader might have had more to show for his life's work than a quiet retreat and the revenue from a television ad.

Japan's Reserve Funds Decreased Last Month

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Japan's reserves of convertible foreign currencies, gold and International Monetary Fund special drawing rights decreased by $1.1 billion in June from the preceding month, to $205.87 billion, the Finance Ministry said yesterday. 
 The decline followed a rise of $1.22 billion in May from April. A large decline in the value of reserves was expected for June because of the intervention to support the yen in foreign exchange markets undertaken by the Bank of Japan and the United States Federal Reserve on June 17. Traders have estimated that the Bank of Japan and the Fed spent a combined $3 billion to $4 billion in propping up the yen. Normally, in months without intervention, Japan's reserves increase $1 billion to $2 billion because of interest earned on holdings.

As Expected, Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged
After a two-day meeting, the Federal Reserve decided not to change interest rates, which had been widely expected.
Several new economic reports indicate that the economy is cooling, which might be the reason for the move. The National Association of Purchasing Management index for June fell to 49.6 from 51.4 in May, the first time in two years that the level has dropped below 50. The Commerce Department also reported that construction slumped 1.5 percent in May, the worst drop in more than four years, and the Conference Board's indicator of future economic activity remained unchanged from April to May at 105.2.

States Lose on Patent Ruling
A Federal appeals court judge ruled that a New Jersey Bank can sue the State of Florida over the state's unauthorized use of a college-savings program. The ruling means states can be sued for infringing patent rights owned by individuals or companies. D2.
 
Boeing Report Bolsters Shares
Shares of Boeing rose 6.45 percent after the company gave a glowing report on its recovery to analysts and reporters. The jet maker said it delivered 61 airplanes in June, the highest one-month total ever, and was on course to meet its goal of delivering 550 jets this year. Even so, many Wall Street analysts remain bearish on Boeing, citing price competition with Airbus, its European rival, continuing weakness in Asia and the specter of rising oil prices. Market Place. D6.
 
Dow Climbs Back Above 9,000
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1 percent, closing above 9,000 for the first time in three weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set another record, jumping to 1,148.56, D5.

Volvo of Sweden confirmed that its chief executive had discussions last Friday with the chairman of Volkswagen amid speculation of a possible alliance or merger between the two auto makers. Although Volvo executives discouraged suggestions that any kind of agreement was imminent, the company has long acknowledged that it is seeking strategic partners. And Volkswagen, which is buying Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, has made no secret of its desire to acquire a truck business. The stock prices of both companies surged. D6.

HEADLINE: Amid Boom, Workers Fret About Future

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Dennis Scudera wears his $7,800 Rolex watch with his hard hat, which he wears while making $34.64 an hour running the 3-ton Caterpillar to scoop out a basement for a Planet Hollywood Hotel being built in midtown Manhattan.
With New York City basking in a building boom, these are hardly hard times for Mr. Scudera -- or most construction workers throughout New York City. But instead of feeling secure in the steady flow of work, they are already worrying about the slowdown they know is inevitable. 
 The workers said it was such a worry that prompted them to turn out by the thousands for Tuesday's rally, which protested the hiring of a nonunion contractor by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
"If the nonunion companies can pay a Mexican $6 an hour -- not that anything's wrong with Mexicans or Italians or whatever -- and get away with it, what good is our union?" Mr. Scudera asked.
Such fears were so widespread that the organizers of the rally did not need a Web site or a news conference or advertisements or any of the other fancy tools of modern political organizing. Beginning eight days before the rally, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York sent one-sided black-and-white fliers to leaders of about 60 union locals.
"All jobs in the five boroughs will be shut down for this rally," the poster said. "Bring union banners and American flags."
The union locals copied the leaflets for shop stewards, who posted them at hundreds of job sites. The day before the rally, union leaders passed out copies in Grand Central Station between 6 and 7 A.M., when most construction workers arrive.
Paul E. Fernandes, assistant to the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council, said nearly every union job in the city -- about 60 percent of all construction in the city -- shut down for the rally. Most nonunion jobs are small; the unions said they took such dramatic action because of the size of the M.T.A. project, which will cost $32.6 million.
The march, though marred by injuries to both the police and the demonstrators, was so huge that even the workers said they were startled. "I didn't do it for now -- I did it for down the road," said Paddy Smith, 30, a bricklayer from Queens who was helping finish a luxury apartment tower on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets.
Fellow workers at the site pulled out their union cards to show that the idea of brotherhood goes beyond the names of the labor groups.
"Other guys have paid the dues," said Vincenzo Realmuto, 54, a laborer from Lodi, N.J. "You know what I mean? Without the unions, it would be like 200 years ago, when the bosses had slaves."
Charles Gallagher, 58, who was laying wood flooring, compared the hiring of nonunion laborers to the diversion of factory jobs to other countries. "These companies want to make the money you can make in New York, but they don't want to pay what it costs -- and that's union scale," Mr. Gallagher said.
Tuesday's demonstrators included plumbers and carpenters, electricians and steamfitters, lathers and laborers.
Despite criticism over the violence that ensued, union leaders said the rally proved that labor was being re-energized as a political force. And leaders have threatened future actions, albeit smaller, against public agencies if they award contracts to companies the unions consider irresponsible -- a response that is being embraced by labor movements across the nation.
"Working people get it," said Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. "When they're asked to respond, they do."
Among the marchers was Gene Bryant, 36, a machine operator who said a nonunion toehold in the city would make a downturn catastrophic for union members. "You've got to make the best of the good times to make it through the slow times," he said.
Mike DePasquale, 33, of the Bronx, took a break from his work on the elevator shaft of a new high-rise in Times Square to recall his stint as a bartender during the construction slowdown of the early 1990's.
Mr. DePasquale said that fresh memory was fueling his fight against the nonunion workers, who he feels lack the training to do safe and skilled work. "It's like hiring a carpenter to do plumbing," Mr. DePasquale said. "You've got to stop it when it starts."

HEADLINE: G.M.'s June Sales Soared; Strikes to Hurt July's

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 1

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that June car and truck sales were the highest for any month in nine years but that July sales would plummet because of two strikes that have shut down most of the auto maker's North American assembly plants.
Ronald L. Zarrella, vice president in charge of G.M.'s North American Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing Group, said at a news conference today that sales would drop 30 percent to 40 percent this month compared with sales from the month a year earlier because of the strikes by the United Automobile Workers. That would push G.M.'s market share to a record low of 25 percent and put G.M. behind the Ford Motor Company as the largest volume vehicle manufacturer in the United States. Already, analysts say the strikes at two plants in Flint, Mich., have cost G.M. $1.18 billion. 
 In June, G.M. sold 492,937 cars and trucks, including heavy trucks, a 24 percent increase compared with sales in the month a year earlier. It was G.M.'s best month since May 1989 and its fourth consecutive month of year-over-year increase. Though total industry sales in June will not be available until Ford reports its sales on Monday, Mr. Zarrella predicted G.M.'s market share would be between 31.5 percent and 33 percent for June.
The Chrysler Corporation, which also reported June figures today, said it had a 10 percent increase in sales compared with those in June 1997.
Despite the strong June sales report for G.M., the strikes, which have closed 26 of the company's 29 North American assembly plants, have already diminished G.M.'s sales by preventing shipment of vehicles to daily rental car fleets, which represent about 20 percent of the auto maker's sales. G.M. was unable to fill an order for 15,000 fleet cars in June and will be unable to fill any fleet orders in July, usually the biggest month of the year for fleet sales, Mr. Zarrella said. In addition, G.M. will be unable to build special-order vehicles, which typically account for 10 percent of sales, and sales to employees, which have been running as high as 5 percent of total sales, will most likely plunge.
If the strike lingers beyond mid-July, the consequences will be more dire and permanent as customers buy cars and trucks from rivals instead of waiting for the strike to end, Mr. Zarrella predicted. "If we can't supply it, we're going to lose customers -- 21,000 customers we're likely to lose every day," he said.
Analysts agree with Mr. Zarrella that those customers could be lost forever. "The competition will take as much advantage of the situation as it can," said Joseph Phillippi, an auto analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York. "That's not just Ford and Chrysler but also imports -- every seller from Hyundai to Mercedes-Benz. And the damage may be lasting."
G.M.'s inventory is already dwindling. The company entered June with 1.1 million cars and trucks in dealer inventory; that number dropped to 850,000 by the end of the month, enough to last through July.
"We have enough retail inventory to allow our dealers to keep the sales momentum going in July," Mr. Zarrella said. "Consumers can still go into G.M. dealerships, see plenty of variety and still get great value despite the fact that we have a strike."
Total United States car and truck sales in June are coming in nearly as strong as sales in May. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars and trucks in May, the best month since September 1986, and was on track to be just as high in June, auto executives and analysts said.
Chrysler set a new monthly sales record, selling 252,485 cars and trucks, a 10 percent increase compared with sales in the month a year earlier and breaking the record set in May, when Chrysler surpassed the quarter million mark for the first time in a single month.
Toyota Motor sales totaled 117,043 cars and trucks, up 17 percent, a new June record. Likewise, Honda Motor sales set a June record, with 88,928 vehicles sold, an increase of 8 percent from the month a year earlier. Mercedes-Benz sales were up 82 percent from June 1997, at 15,134 vehicles. Also reporting higher June sales were Mitsubishi Motors, Subaru, Volvo and Land Rover. Saab and Hyundai Motor sales dropped.
Regardless of the strikes against G.M., analysts predicted the surge of the last two months would ease somewhat in July. Strong sales in May and June were buoyed by attractive incentive programs, some of which will be discontinued. G.M. has already announced that it will not renew its Loyalty First program, which provided owners of G.M. vehicles with certificates of $500 to $1,000 to use toward the purchase of another G.M. vehicle.
Ford and Chrysler have not said whether they will continue their programs, which provide their customers with similar loyalty coupons and allow their dealers to accept G.M. coupons as well, when they expire next week.
Still, auto makers and analysts predict an unprecedented fifth straight year of sales of more than 15 million cars and trucks because of record consumer confidence, low interest rates and inflation and a healthy stock market.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Sends Dual Message To China in Interview on TV

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Thursday, July 2

 BODY:
President Clinton, in his last opportunity to address a mass audience in China, said Wednesday that he would continue to speak out on behalf of democracy and individual liberty, but that the United States did not seek to dictate the path of China's development.
In an interview with China's main Government-run television network to be broadcast today, Mr. Clinton said that China's current course of economic liberalization and greater personal freedom was "morally right," and that the status of the United States as the world's lone superpower did not give it the right to use economic and military might to impose its values on China or any other nation. 
 In the course of the interview, Mr. Clinton sent subtle and somewhat contradictory messages to different audiences in China. His words offered reassurance to President Jiang Zemin and other leaders in Beijing that the United States would not and could not impose its will on China. But he also signaled to ordinary Chinese -- and to domestic critics of his policy of engagement with China -- that he would continue to press Beijing to allow greater personal freedom and take steps toward a more open political system.
"I think there's a genuine movement toward openness and freedom in China, which obviously as an American, and as an American President, I hope will continue and increase and which I believe is right -- morally right -- but I also think it's good for China," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton was asked whether the world needed a single leader to mediate disputes within and among nations. "The short answer to your question is yes, the world needs a leader, but not in the sense of one country telling everyone else what to do," Mr. Clinton said. "So it's a different sort of world leadership than in the past where it's just a question of who has the biggest army gets to send a list of instructions to another country and you think it will be done. That's not the way the world works now."
He gave as examples the United States' intervention in Bosnia and Haiti and its efforts to mobilize other nations to combat drug trafficking, weapons proliferation and ethnic conflict. He said the way to get results in the post-cold-war world was to forge alliances to exert influence, rather than trying to act unilaterally. "And so the United States' role I think is to try to create a structure where more likely than not the right things will be done when problems arise -- not to just do it all ourselves or tell other people what to do," Mr. Clinton said.
The White House sought this interview because an earlier one with CCTV, held before Mr. Clinton left Washington, was heavily edited by the Chinese authorities and received little notice in China. United States officials said they had received assurances that Wednesday's interview would be broadcast in its entirety. It was conducted by Shui Junyi, anchor of CCTV-1's public affairs program "Focus" and Chen Xiaowei, an anchor on CCTV-4, thenetwork's international channel and host of a Sunday news program.
The questioning was gentle compared to the grilling Mr. Clinton got Monday from students at Beijing University who challenged him on United States policy toward Taiwan and human rights in America. Asked when he became interested in China, he gave a vintage Clintonian response. He said he was 8 or 9 years old and reading an encyclopedia when he came across the entry about China.
"And I was fascinated by what I read," Mr. Clinton said. "I always wanted to come here from that time on."
He said the most gratifying thing about his trip was the decision by Mr. Jiang to allow their Saturday press conference and his speech at Beijing University to be carried live on Chinese television. He said he was surprised and pleased by the decision to allow the "open, sweeping communication" with the Chinese people that those two events afforded.
"That I think was very good," Mr. Clinton said. "I think it was also good for the Chinese leaders."
Mr. Clinton sat for the 20-minute interview at the modern Shanghai Stock Exchange, where he received a rousing welcome from traders on the floor. Mr. Clinton conducted a round-table discussion with young entrepreneurs, who told him of the difficulties in starting a new business, securing venture capital and dealing with the bureaucracy. Mr. Clinton told the business people they were an important force for change in China, and a source of the new jobs that will be needed as state-owned enterprises close.
In the afternoon, Mr. Clinton visited a housing development to witness a relatively new phenomenon in China -- private ownership of homes. The Jin Hui Gardens complex opened five years ago, offering Chinese families the opportunity to buy their own apartments for $42,200 to $96,500, according to figures provided by the developers.
Mr. Clinton told families assembled at the development that home ownership represents an investment in society and the bedrock of middle-class life.
"All China benefits from more home owners because that means more jobs, a stronger economy, stronger families," Mr. Clinton said as low clouds threatened rain. "And, of course, when people own their own homes, they are free to take new jobs without worrying about losing housing benefits. We also see around the world that home owners take more responsibility for the communities in which they live."
The President announced a new joint United States-China program to promote the construction of affordable, energy-efficient housing. He also said that American officials would work with Beijing to create a middle-income mortgage-lending market and to strengthen legal rights for property owners.
Today, the President flew to Guilin, a picturesque city on the Li River, where he delivered an address on the environment. He continues on to Hong Kong, where on Friday he will give a speech on the turmoil in the Asian economy to business leaders and conduct a news conference before returning to Washington on Friday night.

HEADLINE: Rosy Economy Is Blemished as Factories Slow

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturers have slowed production to the lowest rate of growth since 1995, the clearest sign so far that the Asian crisis is hurting the American economy.
The slowdown has become increasingly evident with each new economic statistic in recent weeks. Yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity weakened in June for a majority of the companies that it surveys each month. It was the first time in 22 months that a majority had reported weakening instead of strengthening in their businesses. 
 Manufacturing employment has fallen in recent months. And industrial production has slowed sharply this year, to an annual growth rate of 2 percent or so, down from 6 percent last year.
Production is slowing in large part because stockpiles of unsold goods have grown, but also because companies are worried that the economic boom cannot continue at the brisk pace of the last two years.
Companies that make goods for sale abroad have retrenched the most. Take the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation, based in St. Louis, which makes the raw material for cardboard shipping boxes and sells its wares in the United States and abroad. It shut a big mill in Jacksonville, Fla., yesterday for 40 days because of slumping exports to Asia.
Companies are feeling the pressure from their American customers as well. The Goodman Equipment Corporation near Chicago says that corporate customers are placing fewer orders for its plastic molding machines and mining equipment. "They are more nervous about the future, and more reluctant to expand," said Calvin A. Campbell, the company's chairman.
The production slowdown may help to explain why the Federal Reserve chose, at its policy meeting yesterday, to leave interest rates unchanged. Labor shortages and robust economic growth have suggested that higher rates may be needed at some point to slow the economy and prevent inflation from rising. But concerns about the deepening woes in Asia put counterpressure on the Fed to keep rates steady, thereby making investors less likely to switch into dollars from Japanese yen or South Korean won.
The bright spot in manufacturing, which represents 30 percent of the nation's economy, comes from consumer goods. American consumers are still big buyers, and that is strengthening those businesses that serve them. Rubbermaid Inc., for example, which makes toys and plastic garbage cans and has little competition from abroad, says its output and sales are rising at the same rate as last year.
The strong demand at the retail level fosters the hope that the slowdown in manufacturing will be short- lived. If it was to continue, the robust economic growth of the last two years would undoubtedly disappear.
"We don't know which way manufacturing and the economy will go," said William Dudley, chief domestic economist at Goldman, Sachs. "The issue is how strong is the shock from Asia versus how strong is domestic demand. Our view is that domestic demand will win out, but the contest is under way, and we do not have a clear winner yet."
The numbers of late have not been ambiguous. The manufacturing index compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management dropped below 50, to 49.6, in June. That means that manufacturing activity weakened in June for a majority of companies surveyed. The General Motors strike, in its 28th day, is only partly reflected in the latest figure and may add to the drag on manufacturing for a while.
"People started to sense that orders were softening, and they are cutting back inventories," said Norbert Ore, a corporate executive who is chairman of the association's survey committee.
Inventories surged in the first quarter to a record $106 billion as companies like Jefferson Smurfit found their exports suddenly evaporating. The Eastman Chemical Company, which makes the chemical ingredients of plastic products and fibers, responded by trimming a few percentage points off its production. "We never close a plant when demand is not there; what you do is shave back production," said Ernest Deavenport, Eastman's chairman.
Nervousness about the future is also a significant constraint. New orders have been coming more slowly since spring, particularly for companies like Goodman, in Bedford Hills, Ill., which makes equipment and machinery for other manufacturers, and the Hiwasse Company in Jacksonville, Ark., which supplies the control panels for washing machines, stoves and other appliances.
"I had gone on sales calls in February, and customers were urgent in their demand for quotes from me," said J. Richard Derickson, Hiwasse's chief executive. "In April the requests for quotes just dramatically fell off, and they are just beginning to pick up again now."
Hannay Reels Inc. of Westerlo, N.Y., near Albany, which makes metal reels for industrial hoses and fuel trucks, has had a similar experience. "Our production this year is matching last year, which means it has slowed; last year production was up 7 percent," said Roger A. Hannay, the chief executive. "People are putting expansion on hold for a while, until they see what happens to the economy and the stock market."
The weaker production is hardly uniform. General Electric and some other appliance manufacturers say their production is up, not down, thanks to strong consumer demand. The Boeing Company, for all its concern about slowing airplane sales in Asia, is running flat out this year to fill a backlog of orders, although production may slow next year. And the nation's auto makers say that in the first five months of the year they produced 5.2 million vehicles, the same as in the period a year earlier.
But Republic Engineered Steels in Massillon, Ohio, concerned about swelling inventories -- given the potential impact of the Asian crisis -- has been selling off steel since early spring and reducing production. "We felt we had to convert those inventories into cash," said Harold Kelly, Republic's executive vice president. "We want to be more liquid."
Overcapacity is also hurting a variety of businesses. Having closed 11 factories in January, the apparel maker Levi Strauss says its jeans production is now in line with sales. "We were seeing that our market strategy could not be based on volume," said Linda Butler, a Levi Strauss spokeswoman. "We had to emphasize innovative products, made in smaller quantities."
Eastman Chemical is similarly struggling with overcapacity. The company had exported from the United States over the last several years while new plants were being built in Malaysia, Argentina, Spain and the Netherlands. "Now that they are on line, we are exporting less," Mr. Deavenport said. The cutback has come as Asian demand collapses.
Sometimes, chemical products going from Europe to Asia "can't find a home there and they land in the United States," Mr. Deavenport added. "And an American customer says, 'I am going to buy them at a lower price,' and we lose the sale. That is happening all the time now."
The slowdown in manufacturing production is helping to feed some forecasts that the economy will grow in the summer and fall at an annual rate of less than 3 percent, down from a strong 5.4 percent in the first quarter. Despite the surge in prosperity of the last two years, annual economic growth has averaged only 2.3 percent in the 1990's -- the slowest growth of any decade since World War II.

After a weak first quarter, a monthly survey has found that manufacturers may still be cutting back their production of goods, partly in response to rising inventories. Graph tracks industrial production (quarter-to-quarter change, from the first quarter of 1997 through the first quarter of 1998), the index of purchasing managers (from July 1997 through June 1998), and change in inventories (seasonally adjusted in constant dollars, from the first quarter of 1996 through the first quarter of 1998) (Sources: Commerce Department; Haver Analytics; Bloomberg Financial Services)(pg.

HEADLINE: Plugging In to the Internet: Many Paths, Many Speeds

BYLINE: By PETER WAYNER; E-mail address: pwayner@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE first thing anyone who wants to connect to the Internet has to realize is that the Net is not a single entity -- it is a collection of networks joined by a set of standard ways to exchange data. The name Internet even implies that it links networks. This means that almost any system for carrying data -- wires, radio, fiber optics or even smoke signals -- can be hooked into the Internet if it can send that data in the format known as the Internet Protocol, or I.P.
 The good (or bad) news about this open standard for a network is that there are many options for getting connected to the Web. The most popular way is to use the telephone, but new options using the cable system or the cellular phone system are expanding rapidly. 
 Of course, not all choices are available in all areas. Some of the fanciest systems are just being introduced in tests around the country. Others are offered by companies that serve only small regions. With the array of choices available, it is difficult to give straightforward advice that applies to most people.
 Still, there is one general rule: Faster is better. That sounds like a simple standard to apply, but it's surprisingly complex. Some systems can provide great speed consistently. Others offer it only in bursts. Some require you to share the road with your neighbors, which means that service will be slower when people are home and faster when everyone else is asleep. On others, information moves at different speeds when it travels in different directions. You might be able to download, or receive, large volumes of data quickly, but the time to upload, or send, information could be much slower.
 The problem becomes even more complicated because a fast connection between you and your service provider does not guarantee that information will arrive quickly. Data will often travel through more than 20 connections between your machine and a distant Web site. The weakest link limits the speed at which your computer will get the data.
 Another important detail is service. Some people are comfortable working with computers, while others want someone else to worry about the details. Some of the biggest brands in the on-line business got there by concentrating on making their connecting process as simple and bulletproof as possible.
 Ways of connecting require not only special hardware and software but also a relationship with an Internet service provider, known as an I.S.P. Look before you leap, and add up all the costs and benefits. This is only a general guide; specifics vary considerably from place to place and from company to company.
 So, with that said, here's a thumbnail guide to the sometimes bewildering world of connecting to the Internet.

GRAPHIC: Charts: "Ways to Connect"
 
Phone Line (Analog)
MAXIMUM SPEED*: 56 Kbps.
DOWNLOAD TIME FOR "MOBY DICK" ON-LINE BOOK+: 2.8 minutes at 56 Kbps.
COST: $30-$200 for modem, I.S.P. charges extra.
AVAILABILITY: Nationwide.
 WHILE the telephone system is the most common way for people to connect to the Internet from home, it was engineered to carry voices, not data, over the lines. Modems to carry data were developed as afterthoughts, and the phone companies are fond of saying that they do not guarantee that modems will work. Many glitches people report with modems, like sudden disconnections, are in some ways the result of trying to carry data by turning it into high-pitched squeaks through a modem.
Despite that, connecting with the phone system is relatively easy, and phone service is almost ubiquitous. Most I.S.P.'s offer CD-ROM's or floppy disks with all the necessary software to connect through a modem. These are usually programmed with the standard settings for most major computers and modems, but problems still occur occasionally. The I.S.P.'s also offer some hand-holding advice if things go wrong.
One of the biggest headaches for some I.S.P.'s is providing enough phone lines. They get charged for each line coming in to their headquarters, so they try to minimize the number of lines. Also, growth can swamp an I.S.P. (Remember when America Online gained so many customers so fast that many had problems connecting?) Companies are still trying to find the right balance of prices and service for a sustainable I.S.P. business.
A recent problem has arisen from the slightly confusing transition to 56 K modems. They are supposed to move data at the rate of 56,000 bits (or 56 kilobits) per second, roughly equivalent, depending on the technology, to 1,000 to 2,000 words per second. Often phone systems cannot support high speeds, and these modems are forced to work a little more slowly. Two companies tried to corner the market in the modem business by introducing competing standards that could not interact. A compromise standard, called V.90, has been designed, but it is not widely available, which means that your modem may not communicate well with your I.S.P.'s modem, and the glitches can be maddening because they can seem random.
 
I.S.D.N.
MAXIMUM SPEED*: 128 Kbps.
"MOBY DICK" DOWNLOAD TIME+: 1.2 minutes.
COST: $0-$250 for installation++, $30-$200 per month for service, I.S.P. charges extra.
AVAILABILITY: Most major cities.
 
A.D.S.L.
MAXIMUM SPEED*: 1.5 Mbps-8 Mbps download, 640 Kbps upload.
"MOBY DICK" DOWNLOAD TIME+: Less than a second.
COST: $300 and up for installation, $60-$400 per month for service, I.S.P. charges extra.
AVAILABILITY: Limited mostly to trial areas in major cities, including New York.
 FASTER digital telephone lines are available from phone companies in some parts of the country. The services are called I.S.D.N., for integrated services digital network, and A.D.S.L., for asymmetric digital subscriber line.
I.S.D.N. is older and slower (up to about 128 kilobits per second) than A.D.S.L., but it is available in more areas of the country.
I.S.D.N., the first major attempt by the phone companies to move toward a digital system, allows people with the service to get both voice and data calls on the same line. That is why the system is called integrated.
A.D.S.L. is much faster, but it is available only to lucky people living in the right neighborhoods.
Phone companies are experimenting with many different variations of digital subscriber lines and tagging them with similar names. For this reason, some people use the term xDSL to refer to the entire batch; the "x" stands for any of the possible acronyms.
The prices for these services can be confusing because each phone company has persuaded the tariff board regulating it to allow different rates. As a result, the cost of I.S.D.N. can be reasonable in some parts of the country ($40 per month), but a luxury ($200 per month or more) in others.
A bigger problem is the lack of widespread expertise with the technology. You have to buy a different type of modem to use either A.D.S.L. or I.S.D.N. You might also need a new phone line or two.
People are usually happy with the fast connections -- once they get them working. In many cases, the local phone company will sell a package that includes installation, but the amount of support varies. And you will still need an I.S.P. in addition to your phone line. That makes the hardware and service pretty pricey, but some people think that it's worth it.
 
Cable Modem
MAXIMUM SPEED*: 1 Mbps-10 Mbps download, 768 Kbps upload.
"MOBY DICK" DOWNLOAD TIME+: Less than a second.
COST: $0-$300 for installation++, $40-$50 per month for service above television bill, includes I.S.P.
AVAILABILITY: Limited to major metropolitan areas.
 THE cable television companies realized long ago that their shielded wires, which are protected against electromagnetic interference, could carry much more information than the largely unshielded wires used by the telephone company. The downside is that many homes in the same neighborhood, known as the local loop, share the same cable wire, much like a telephone party line in the past. The first adopters of cable-modem Internet links speak lovingly of their high-speed connections, but it is unclear whether performance will suffer in the long term if everyone in the neighborhood starts downloading big files at the same time. No one knows how usage patterns and service commitments from the cable companies will evolve over time.
Right now, cable access to the Internet requires a special modem that is usually installed by a technician from the cable company. The technician will also check your system to insure that the proper security provisions are in place. That is important because the party-line nature of the technology makes it easier for neighbors to poke into your business.
Access to cable-modem service is limited by economics. The cable companies are rolling out new service in some areas, like Baltimore County and parts of New Jersey, as a test. Each company decides where to offer service based on how much money it thinks it can make in an area, so it helps to live in a place filled with other Internet addicts. Comcast, the cable company serving Baltimore County, is spending heavily to offer the service in that suburban area, while the company serving the city of Baltimore, TCI, has been taking its time.
 
T-1 Line
MAXIMUM SPEED*: 1.54 Mbps.
"MOBY DICK" DOWNLOAD TIME+: 0.105 seconds.
COST: $1,000 and up for installation,
$500-$1,000 or more per month for service, I.S.P. charges extra.
AVAILABILITY: Anywhere a dedicated line can be installed.
BUSINESSES with local networks often get on the Internet by leasing from the phone company high-speed lines that link directly to major I.S.P.'s. All the traffic from an office network is then shipped out on one of these high-speed lines. It is much more reliable and efficient than putting a modem on each desk.
These leased lines, which include T-1 lines, come in a variety of sizes, and the price often depends on the distance to the local switching center. It is hard to generalize about these prices, but lower-capacity lines often run between $300 and $1,000 a month just for the telephone company's fees; T-1's can cost $1,000 to $2,000 a month or more. There are additional costs from the I.S.P. that handles the job of shipping the data to the world.
The idea of sharing leased lines is becoming popular in apartment complexes. Sometimes a group of neighbors will form a cooperative to share the costs. In other cases, a real-estate developer will provide the service as an incentive for home-based businesses and other small companies that cannot afford their own technology staff. And many luxury apartment buildings are starting to offer such lines to attract tenants.
 
"Less-Traveled Roads to Cyberspace"
 
SATELLITE HYBRIDS
Some of the same companies that make the digital satellite dishes used for television reception are offering Internet service through the same system. The good news is that the bandwidth from the satellite to your house is high. The Web pages you request travel down a channel that can easily handle 500 kilobits per second or more.
There are two caveats: First, the channel is a party line shared by all users in the country and, second, the bandwidth out of your house is more conventional because it travels over phone lines using a modem. If your Internet usage involves lots of short requests for big blocks of data, then the imbalance is not a problem. But if you want to ship out as much data as you pull in, this service is not the best solution. Digital satellite systems like Hughes's DirecPC are available at most places in North America where you can hang an 18-inch satellite dish and point it south.
 
CELLULAR-BASED WIRELESS SERVICE
Many cellular phone companies are offering wireless Internet service, which is integrated with the system that provides cellular calls. The Internet service requires a special type of modem with an antenna. The quality of the service, of course, depends upon how well radio signals travel in your neighborhood. Tall buildings can be a problem, and signals will sometimes not penetrate deeply inside other buildings. The quality of the service can also depend on the distance between the modem's antenna and the nearest cellular system antenna.
The radio modem often works well with laptops. That kind of tetherless freedom is its biggest selling point.
The cellular companies are adding new data-carrying service throughout the country, but coverage varies widely and you should check with your local carrier.
 
OTHER RADIO-BASED SERVICE
A wide variety of radio modems are offered by companies that do not sell phone service over their networks. These are often used by businesses like package-delivery companies and cab companies to keep track of their fleets and dispatch them. Still, some offer service that can be used by the average consumer.
The structure of these networks varies. In some cases, there are thousands of small antennas attached to lampposts throughout the city. Metricom is one example of a company using this solution, but it does that in only three major metropolitan areas -- the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle and Washington. In other cases, companies use satellites to broadcast information to reach all of North America. That is popular with trucking companies. Other wireless companies use methods similar to those used by the cellular phone industry, with towers every mile or two.
 
BROADCAST SERVICE
One of the more intriguing ways to get information from the Web is just emerging. Some companies are sending information hidden in the corners of radio and television signals. Users with television cards in their PC's can program their computers to grab this information and store it locally.
These methods are great if you want access to sophisticated and popular information without waiting. It may take too long to download a film clip through a modem, but a news company could broadcast the same clip to people throughout the country simultaneously. The next time you turned to your machine, the entire clip could be stored on your hard disk.
But this approach has several limitations. You can get only what the broadcaster wants to send you, so only the major services with broad appeal, like CNN.com, will arrive this way. Also, you cannot send data through your card. Most people will want to maintain a standard dial-up service to handle E-mail and Web data that the broadcasters do not offer. Still, if you regularly check the weather, headlines, sports news or other popular services, broadcast service has plenty of appeal.

From Hoops To Heartaches
It is often said in Hollywood that young directors and writers should start with a subject they know well, so why is Kevin Rodney Sullivan making his debut as a feature film director with a movie about a woman's search for love in seemingly the wrong place? 
 Mr. Sullivan (above), a onetime child actor who has written screenplays and directed television movies, has directed "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," a film based on Terry McMillan's popular novel and due in theaters on Aug. 14.
The movie, about a 40-year-old career woman and single mother who falls in love with a Jamaican man 20 years her junior, stars Angela Bassett as Stella and Whoopi Goldberg as her good friend Delilah. It is being distributed by 20th Century Fox.
Mr. Sullivan, who has been eager to direct a feature film, said the choice of this "woman's movie" was not as unusual as it might sound. First, the last movie based on one of Ms. McMillan's novels, "Waiting to Exhale," was also directed by a man, Forest Whitaker. More important, Mr. Sullivan said, "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" is about love, and that is something men can understand.
Still, Mr. Sullivan, 39, whose last television film was "The Soul of the Game," for HBO, about basketball, fathers and sons, said directing "Stella" had, in some respects, been an odd experience. There were plenty of times, he said, when he and Ron Bass, one of the screenwriters, felt a little lonely, since the film focuses on a woman, her best friend and her sisters.
"Ron and I were the only men in the room a lot of times," Mr. Sullivan said. "It made us friends real quickly."
Mr. Sullivan spent years as an actor, appearing in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," and in the television series "Happy Days."
He then wrote for the television series "Fame" and directed television movies.
"It would be a lie to say there was no difference making a movie like this," he said, referring to "Stella." "But I know what it is like to be into and to fall in love with the most inappropriate person. It didn't feel like I was going on an expedition into unknown territory."
Nevertheless, he said, he and Mr. Bass often had to defer to what the actresses said a woman would feel or not feel at a certain moment.
Mr. Sullivan, who is black, said he felt that the movie was mainly a love story, but that he was concerned it might be perceived as a "black film" and thus marketed to a limited audience.
He expressed some frustration that even though there are many ethnic movies, so-called black movies still have to struggle to attract a broader audience.
"The film business is a little slow in getting around to what the world is thinking," he said. "The world is not Anglo-Saxon. The paying audience wants diversity, and they appreciate good stories no matter what the cultural background.
"Films like this, I think, say the barrier should come down a little quicker."
 
Weird Is Cool
The bigger the entertainment conglomerates get, the more they rely on supposed formulas for making successful movies. And few formulas are embraced more than the one that says that when the weather turns hot, a blockbuster needs lots of special effects, a marketing tie-in with a taco and a strong dose of death and mayhem. Just like, say, "Dr. Dolittle." Huh?
Expectations were shattered when "Dr. Dolittle," an oddball children's film from 20th Century Fox starring the protean Eddie Murphy (above), battered its rivals and brought in an astounding $29 million on its opening last weekend. Jaws dropped around Hollywood because, put simply, the film, about a strange doctor who can talk to animals, does not fit the formulas.
Worse, critics were generally hostile. Richard Corliss, of Time, was typical in calling it a "slow, vacant farce." (Janet Maslin of The New York Times, however, called it "the sunniest family film so far this season.")
"It turns out kids don't read reviews," said Betty Thomas, the movie's outspoken director. "I guess that's good."
Ms. Thomas, 49, was gloating happily about the success of "Dr. Dolittle," but even she admitted that she had no idea the film would open so big.
"I was confused by the initial reaction," she said. "But it's funny. Doesn't anyone remember how to have fun anymore?"
But as improbable as the movie's immense success is the fact that a director like Ms. Thomas made it. Not surprisingly, she said she had initially scoffed at the project. The movie is based on the sweet children's stories of Hugh Lofting and follows by several decades a treacly, musical version of the movie that starred Rex Harrison.
"I don't like cute," said Ms. Thomas (left), which is not hard to believe, given that her last movie was "Private Parts," about the sex-obsessed shock jock Howard Stern. "I'm not a fan of cute. I'm into funny. My kind of funny."
She said her first reaction was swift.
"I said, 'Get serious,' " Ms. Thomas recalled. "Then they said Eddie Murphy was going to do it. That's when I said: 'That's interesting. That's unusual. That's not what people expect.' I like to come out of left field, so that appealed. Eddie was the reason."
With Mr. Murphy's edgy brand of comedy, the movie was given a slightly irreverent tone, with many anatomical jokes.
That contributed, Ms. Thomas said, to the real message behind the movie, which worked hard to be more than just a romp with a silly man who thinks he can talk to animals.
"I really think that the movie's about the artists in the world and how we have to accept them as they are," Ms. Thomas said. "Parents are too busy saying to their kids, you have to get good grades, you have to get into the right schools, you have to do everything right. I felt we had to get across that weird people are where it's at!"
 
Boom Town
Hollywood's stock in trade is illusion, of course, principally about itself.
But one of its greatest illusions is less well known: that the movie studios, as businesses, have never been that significant a presence in the Los Angeles economy.
That is, until now.
The Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation recently issued a report on the film industry in large part to counter some old myths and to underscore the remarkable arc of growth in this booming industry.
The movie studios were once dwarfed as employers by other industries, among them aerospace, particularly in cities like Burbank that had a reputation of being dominated by the studios.
But the recession of the early 1990's hit the aerospace companies hard, and the subsequent boom in all facets of entertainment has made the studios, for the first time, huge businesses with payrolls to match the impact of the movies on the public consciousness.
The report said that 96,000 jobs were added to the movie industry between 1990 and 1997. An additional 6,000 jobs have been added this year, making it, the report said, something of a slow one. The economic development corporation estimates that total movie-related employment in Los Angeles County is now 500,000.
Even those figures understate the impact of the industry on the local economy, however.
According to the report, the new jobs are not ordinary; they pay significantly more than other kinds of jobs, on average. By one estimate, they pay an average of $53,000 a year.
The Motion Picture Producers Association said earlier this year that the industry generated $25.6 billion in economic activity in Los Angeles County in 1996, the latest year for which there are figures, compared with $15 billion in 1992. And the report estimated that between now and 2001, demand for films would grow 7 percent a year.
But one of the more interesting pieces of information about the structure of the movie industry concerned who employs all these people. According to the report, the studios themselves actually account for a tiny fraction of the jobs.
Figures supplied by the United States Department of Commerce showed that a whopping 78 percent of jobs came from companies with one to four employees. An additional 8.6 percent of the jobs were at companies with five to nine employees. Less than 1 percent of the jobs came from employers with 1,000 or more employees.
In other words, the vast majority of the overall employment in the movie industry is not in the most visible entities, the studios, but in tiny companies.
And most of those provide specific services, including everything from costume design to computerized special effects, often on a per-job basis.

Treasury Prices Stage a Rally As the Dollar Gathers Strength

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rallied in an abbreviated pre-holiday session yesterday, as the dollar gathered strength in currency trading and the Government's latest report on employment suggested the economy was slowing.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32, to 107 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 5.60 percent, from 5.62 percent on Wednesday. Last Friday, the yield was 5.63 percent. The market closed at 2 P.M. yesterday and will be closed today in observance of Independence Day. 
 Gains came early as the dollar rallied against the yen on investors' skepticism over Japan's latest plan to fix its ailing banks. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
Bond prices were also bolstered by the June employment report, which showed that the pace of job creation slowed in the month. "This report provided some bullish support for the market because it revealed significantly lower wage pressures than the market was expecting," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Some analysts have said that if signals of an economic slowdown continue, the market may even begin to price in the possibility of a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But minutes of the May 19 meeting of Fed policy makers, which were released yesterday, show that the Fed remained concerned about a flare-up in inflation. The decision to hold rates steady at the May meeting came over the objections of two Fed policy makers.
The May meeting minutes "tell us that it will take many more economic reports to convince policy makers that current economic growth is no longer a threat to our long-term inflation outlook," Mr. Chan said. "Recent trends show this may very well occur in the near-term future."
Next week investors have little hard data to scrutinize, with the report on June producer prices on Friday being the most important report.

Dow Slips by 23.41 Points In 3d-Lightest Day of Year

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday on the third-lightest trading day of the year after Government reports on jobs and manufacturing suggested that profits could suffer from a slowing economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.41 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 9,025.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.14 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,146.42. The Nasdaq composite index had its biggest loss since June 15, sliding 20.46 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,894. 
 "With the Asian fallout, many companies are finding a fundamental deterioration in the demand for their goods and services," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer for the BankBoston Corporation, which manages $30 billion.
With many traders off early for the Independence Day holiday, volume on the New York Stock Exchange was just 509 million shares, well below the three-month daily average of 607 million.
The Government reported that orders placed with United States factories declined 1.6 percent in May and that unemployment rose to a three-month high of 4.5 percent. Analysts had expected a jobless rate of 4.3 percent, unchanged from May. Manufacturing employment took its biggest drop since March 1996, as Asia's economic crisis and the initial stages of the strike against General Motors took their toll.
The reports did not come as a complete surprise. Some investors were already expecting the economy to slow. In the computer industry, a slump has been dragging down profits for months.
Parametric Technology, which makes software that helps engineers design cars, planes and heavy equipment, was the biggest decliner after warning that earnings are being hurt by slack demand for its software in Asia. Shares of Parametric tumbled 8 3/4, to 16 1/16.
CompUSA, the nation's largest computer retailer, also warned of bad news on profits. CompUSA said it would report an unexpected loss in the fiscal fourth quarter because of falling personal computer prices and weak demand. Shares of CompUSA fell 11/16, to 16 7/8, bringing their decline for 1998 to 46 percent.
Sun Microsystems and I.B.M. declined after John B. Jones Jr., an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, lowered earnings estimates for the companies -- both of which have extensive operations in Asia. I.B.M. fell 1 9/16, to 115 3/16, and Sun dropped 2 7/16, to 42 1/2.
Mr. Jones wrote to clients that Asia's economic woes were intensifying, which is likely to slow growth in Japan. He added that he expected the yen to weaken relative to the dollar.
On the positive side, Netscape Communications surged for a second day on speculation that the Internet browser pioneer might attract an investment from a large media company. Netscape rose 5 5/8, to 4 15/16, up 55 percent for the holiday-shortened week.
Over all, analysts' expectations for growth in second-quarter operating earnings for the S.& P. 500 dropped to 2.3 percent this week from 3.6 percent last week, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings.
More than half the decline came from analysts who reduced their estimates because of the G.M. strike, said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call. The rest of the drop reflects the effects of the economic downturn in Asia, he said.

HEADLINE: Orders to Factories Fell by 1.6% in May

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Orders placed with United States factories declined in May from the previous month, suggesting that manufacturing is losing speed.
Factory orders fell 1.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $333 billion after rising a revised seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, to $338.6 billion, previously reported as a 1.2 percent gain, the Commerce Department reported today. Slower demand for electrical equipment and aircraft and parts drove May's decline. 
 In addition, factory orders outside the volatile category of aircraft and other transportation equipment fell 1.5 percent in May after declining three-tenths of 1 percent the previous month. Excluding the military industry, factory orders fell 1.7 percent in May compared with a gain in April of five-tenths of 1 percent.
Factory inventories increased one-tenth of 1 percent in May after rising four-tenths of 1 percent in April. And shipments, a gauge of current demand, fell four-tenths of a percent in May after falling 1.1 percent in April. That suggests that demand is weak.

HEADLINE: Restore Hamilton To His Pedestal

BYLINE: By Michael Lind; Michael Lind, Washington editor of Harper's Magazine, is the editor of "Hamilton's Republic."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If you join the crowd on the Mall this Fourth of July, you'll see majestic and luminous monuments to George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, and even a new memorial to Franklin Roosevelt. But something is missing. There is no Hamilton memorial. This omission is not only unjust, but peculiar. For Alexander Hamilton, as much as any other American, deserves credit for the United States' pre-eminent position among nations.
His imprint on our society is deep and wide, and has never been more obvious than it is today. He favored a more centralized union and wrote two-thirds of the Federalist Papers defending the Constitution. As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton established the Bank of the United States, precursor of the Federal Reserve, and he spelled out the industrial policy that transformed America into an economic power of unparalleled strength. 
 Hamilton was not only the most brilliant of the Founders, but also the most flamboyant. An orphan raised in the West Indies, he was the only self-made man in a galaxy of patricians. His adulterous affair with Maria Reynolds produced the first great sex scandal in American politics. And his life was cut short, at the age of 49, when he was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr on July 11, 1804.
It is fashionable to invoke Jefferson as the philosopher of American democracy. But his ideal America was based on states' rights, agrarian capitalism and isolationism. Hamilton, on the other hand, envisioned the nation that we have become, a centralized industrial superpower with civil rights enforced by the Federal Government.
Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves and argued that blacks were naturally inferior and should not be emancipated unless they were sent to Africa. Hamilton, by contrast, believed that black Americans deserved citizenship and should be armed as soldiers during the Revolutionary War.
"The contempt we have been taught to entertain for the blacks makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience," he wrote. "The dictates of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favor of this unfortunate class of men." In the first years of the Republic, Hamilton helped found the Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves. His ideals, not Jefferson's, were realized when slavery and then segregation were smashed by Federal power.
The idolization of Jefferson and the downgrading of Hamilton is a recent phenomenon. For most of our history their status was reversed, not only in the eyes of Northerners but also in those of enlightened Southern nationalists like John Marshall and Henry Clay. "For many decades after the Civil War," Hamilton's biographer, Forrest McDonald, writes, "his niche in the pantheon of American demigods was beneath only Washington's, if indeed it was not at Washington's right hand."
In "The Promise of American Life," published in 1909, the Progressive thinker Herbert Croly praised Hamilton's view that "the central government is to be used not merely to maintain the Constitution, but to promote the national interest and to consolidate the national organization" while he debunked the misguided Jeffersonian theory that "there should be as little government as possible."
The Hamiltonian tradition of democratic nationalism was carried on, in different ways, by Progressive Republicans and by New Dealers who acted as Hamiltonians even as they appeased Southern Democrats by extolling Jefferson.
In the past quarter century, however, the Hamiltonian ideal of a strong, prosperous and integrated American nation-state has come under attack from all sides. The multicultural left rejects the idea of an integrated American nation, while the fundamentalist right vilifies the Federal Government as an instrument of tyranny, if not a tool of Satan.
Whereas Hamilton wanted industry and finance to serve the national interest, today many executives and investors view the nation-state as an obsolete hindrance to their personal profit in the "global market." Hamilton envisioned a partnership of government and business. Today, the left likes government and hates business, while the right likes business and hates government.
If either side should prevail, America will come to resemble a continental chaos of squabbling ethnic groups with an incompetent military, a feeble government and an economy that enriches only a tiny oligarchy.
To avert that fate we must renew the tradition founded by Alexander Hamilton. Unfortunately, that tradition is not yet symbolized by a Hamilton memorial on the Mall in Washington. Until one is built, we will have to make do with the existing monuments to the Hamiltonian vision: West Point and the Pentagon, the Federal Reserve, the interstate highway and air travel systems, Detroit and the Silicon Valley.
And, not least, the Federal courthouses that attest to the fact that -- no matter what the case is elsewhere -- in our democracy individual rights and national authority are not enemies, but allies.

HEADLINE: New York Officials to Impose Sanctions on Swiss Banks Sept. 1

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Officials of the City and State of New York said yesterday that they would begin imposing sanctions on Swiss banks on Sept. 1, hoping that the two-month "cooling off period" would persuade Swiss bank officials and lawyers for Holocaust survivors and heirs to reach a settlement.
Barring Swiss banks from bidding on overnight deposits, which average more than $2 billion just for the city, would be the first step, followed in stages by barring other business, canceling existing contracts and selling all stocks in Swiss companies. 
 The State Department said sanctions, last used to bring pressure to end apartheid in South Africa, were "unjustified, unwarranted and counterproductive" to reaching a quick settlement of the claims of Holocaust survivors, whose average age is 81.
Sanctions could undermine New York's position as the financial capital of the global economy by raising doubts about how open American financial markets are, Under Secretary of State Stuart E. Eizenstat said in an interview. He also said he had urged the Swiss Government not to overreact to the sanctions and retaliate with actions that could make a settlement more difficult to achieve.
Two Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, offered $600 million last month to settle claims.
Mel Weiss, one of the lawyers for the survivors, heirs and charities representing heirless assets, proposed settling the case for $1.5 billion, provided the Swiss Government and the Swiss National Bank joined in a "global settlement."
The talks collapsed after Mr. Weiss made his proposal last month. The sanctions were announced by the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a day after a meeting in which they said that the Swiss Consul General in New York, Jacques Reverdin, told a panel of state and local government finance officials that the Swiss Government would never contribute to a restitution fund.
Mr. Hevesi said that Mr. Reverdin's statements revealed a change from the posture the Swiss Government had taken in private talks, which he said was to signal that it would ease a "global settlement" to resolve all claims. These, he said, would include those against the Swiss Government and its central bank.
Mr. Hevesi said the Swiss Government's position amounted to "denying moral responsibility" for buying stolen assets, including gold removed from the teeth of Nazi death-camp victims.
"No punishment is being asked, no penalty," Mr. Hevesi said. "It is restitution we seek."
Mr. Hevesi pointed to a May 25 report by a panel created by the Swiss Government, known as the Bergier Commission, which concluded that by 1942 Swiss Government officials knew that the gold the Nazis sold to them was looted from Jews, a practice that was so obvious that it could be discerned by careful readers of Swiss newspapers. He said the report should have spurred the Swiss Government to "prepare its people" to support a settlement.
Mr. Reverdin said that the Swiss Government had been unwavering in its position that all claims concerning assets that the Nazis stole from Jews and then sold to the Swiss National Bank were resolved by a 1946 agreement reached in Washington and signed by the World War II Allies.
"This is a settled matter and there is no reason to reopen it," Mr. Reverdin said.
Mr. Eizenstat said the Swiss Government had never changed its position that it would support any settlement that the two banks might reach, but that it was not a party to the talks and was not obligated to pay.
Swiss banks were paid about $31 million in investment fees by the city in the last year, more than 10 percent of the $285 million that the city spent on investment management, advice and broker commissions, Steve Newman, the First Deputy City Comptroller, estimated.
Mr. McCall's office could not immediately supply comparable figures.
If all 800 state and local government finance officers were to terminate short-term investment dealings with Swiss banks, the annual fees would quickly total more than the $900 million difference between the banks' offer and Mr. Weiss's proposal.
The sanctions plan calls for the city and state to begin sanctions on Sept. 1 by barring overnight investments with Swiss banks, new letters of credit agreements and taking part in underwriting new state and city debt.
On Nov. 15, if no settlement is reached, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. McCall will recommend excluding Swiss companies like Scudder Kemper Investments and SBC Warburg Dillon Read & Company from searches for new pension fund investment managers and barring existing managers from doing business through Swiss companies.
On Jan. 1 the two officials would recommend canceling existing investment management contracts, like a CS First Boston contract to manage $740 million for the city pension fund. They would also ask the Legislature and City Council to pass laws barring Swiss companies from selling goods and services to the state and city.
Finally, on July 1, 1999, they would seek to have the $106 billion state pension fund and the $82 billion city pension fund begin divesting their holdings in Swiss companies. The city owns $735 million in stock in Swiss companies, including $136.7 million in the Swiss banks, Mr. Hevesi said.

Star System Is Declining In the N.B.A.

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THE New Jersey philanthropist who envisions the Nets becoming part of Newark's downtown revival apparently did his homework in basketball economics. Ray Chambers, who helped broker the deal that will very likely transfer the team to two real estate developers, called around the sport's power circles and raised the question that most owners haven't satisfactorily answered themselves.
Of at least two sources, Chambers asked why Finn Wentworth and Stanley Gale of Florham Park, N.J., should plunk down $150 million for control of the Nets and then face contract negotiations with Keith Van Horn, Jayson Williams and Kerry Kittles that would ultimately cost them more than the franchise is worth. He was told that under the present system, the Nets will wind up paying Van Horn a $100 million-plus jackpot that would probably preclude them from keeping the other two players. 
 Same story as in Minnesota, where ownership can afford Stephon Marbury or Tom Gugliotta or possibly neither after shelling out $126 million at boardroom gunpoint last summer for Kevin Garnett. This entertaining young team is almost certain to die in its infancy as a result.
"The days of having three stars are gone," one well-connected agent said recently. "It's two stars and then managing well enough to surround them with the right role players."
This works out if those stars are Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, John Stockton and Karl Malone. Most of the time, it looks more like Chris Webber and Juwan Howard, teams that function more like insipid monarchs.
Michael Jordan notwithstanding, the concept of the National Basketball Association as a quality team sport is the reason to root for David Stern and the owners in the latest round of labor chess. Hope for them to somehow lower the ceiling on these $20 million-a-year stars, and not because the commissioner has virtue on his side, but because the odds of building and maintaining a cohesive team of diverse skill have become too high.
The bottom line that the players had better read is that the product not only costs too much for the paying fan, it also too often stinks.
The old-school union thinking, espoused long ago by the late Larry Fleisher, is that only the superstars, with their rising salaries, can set the table for everyone else. Not in this market, though. Now a couple of players, often leveraging only their potential, gorge themselves and leave behind only minimum-salary scraps and bones. At last count, there were 150 players making the minimum. It is almost comical when the union claims it is fighting for basketball's "middle class" at the same time it refuses to discuss a system that would restore a modicum of sanity to the top-tier salary.
Patrick Ewing is the association's president, and that helps explain it. For 10 years, Ewing thought collective bargaining meant him, David Falk and someone from the Knicks. Three summers ago, Falk the agent informed Ewing and Jordan that the union was about to cut a deal that would imperil the superstar windfall. Ewing became an instant activist, and he helped save a system that produced a cool $66 million for him last summer.
When Ewing demonstrates sympathy for less fortunate teammates, I will take him more seriously as the representative of all players. Meanwhile, reporters seeking a few complimentary parting words on Charles Oakley last week were hung up on. I ran into Ewing at a dinner in Washington last Friday, asked about Oakley and was promptly shooed away. Six days after the trade, Ewing finally addressed the subject, but only at his own news conference to unveil a painting. What a piece of work.
Ewing complained that no other industry limits salaries, which is news to postal workers, but there is nothing to prevent him and Jordan from selling themselves as prime-time programming to CBS, Disney or Fox. If the $20 million-a-year basketball star makes dollars and sense, you can bet Uncle Rupert or some other television network will pay it.
Basketball has always been a star and ego-driven sport, but the N.B.A. marketeers went too far in exploiting this theme while expanding and diluting their league, and now the system has degenerated too much for the players to stop believing in the parables spun in their behalf. They don't see Mark McGwire coming or Jordan going. They don't recognize the cyclical nature of entertainment and sports. Reebok didn't fire Shaquille O'Neal this week because he doesn't make free throws. People are tiring of the rap and the hype.
Two stars in basketball is no better a review than it is in the movies.

HEADLINE: Notes Show Fed Is Still Worried About Inflation

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Despite signs that the economy might be slowing, the Federal Reserve remained concerned at its May meeting about a potential outbreak of inflation. Two of the 12 members on the Fed's policy-making committee voted against the panel's decision then to hold interest rates steady.
Minutes of the May 19 meeting, released today, suggested that there was considerable unease within the policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, about waiting any longer for an economic slowdown that always seemed to be just around the corner but never quite materialized. For some members, the minutes said, the decision not to raise rates "was a close call." 
 Although the panel voted to hold the Federal funds target rate, the primary short-term rate controlled by the Fed, steady at 5.5 percent, it decided then to maintain its formal policy "bias" toward a tighter monetary policy, the minutes said, a signal that it still leans toward raising rates in the absence of a clear slowdown.
The two members who bucked Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and voted for an immediate interest rate increase were Jerry L. Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who was attending only his second meeting of the committee.
Mr. Jordan had also voted to raise rates at the Fed's March 31 meeting, where he was the lone dissenter. One of the features of Mr. Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman has been to encourage consensus on interest-rate decisions, and it has been more than four years since as many as two members broke with the majority on a vote. It is particularly unusual that a relatively new member like Mr. Poole, who took office on March 23, would dissent.
On Wednesday, the Fed again decided to keep interest rates on hold after a two-day meeting. The decision came in the wake of further evidence that Asia's financial crisis is helping to slow growth to noninflationary levels. Those reports were reinforced today by the news that the unemployment rate edged up in June to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent the previous month.
Minutes of this week's meeting will be released on Aug. 20, two days after the Fed's next policy-setting session.
The minutes of the May 19 meeting provided only a dry and sketchy account of the day's debate.
But they gave a summary of the reasoning of Mr. Poole and Mr. Jordan in dissenting from the decision to keep policy on hold. Both men are monetarists who believe that clues to the likelihood of a resurgence of inflation can be discerned in the growth of the money supply. Although rapid money supply growth was discredited as a predictor of inflation during the mid-1980's because of sweeping changes to the nation's financial structure, it has lately shown signs of becoming a reliable early warning signal.
"Mr. Poole dissented because he believed that the sustained increase in money growth in recent quarters and associated accommodative conditions in the credit markets pointed to rising inflation," the minutes said.
Mr. Jordan, the minutes said, was concerned that the rapid growth in the money supply was fueling speculative excesses. "In his view, these high growth rates were fueling unsustainably rapid increases of real estate and other asset prices, and reports of 'too much cash chasing too few deals' were becoming more frequent," the minutes said. Ultimately, Mr, Jordan said, the Fed faced "a choice between smaller increases in interest rates sooner versus larger increases later."
The members of the committee who voted to keep rates unchanged cited a variety of reasons for not moving, according to the minutes.
They said they believed that companies would want to run down the large inventories of supplies and goods built up in the first quarter, resulting in reduced demand. And they expressed concern that Asia's economy continued to deteriorate, likely leading to further downturns in demand for American goods.
"Despite the failure of domestic demand to moderate in line with their earlier expectations, the members were persuaded that appreciable slowing in the growth of economic activity was a likely prospect over the course of coming quarters even though its exact timing and extent was unknown," the minutes said.
Reinforcing the decision on rates, the minutes said, was concern that any increase could have "outsized effects" on Asian financial markets, potentially leading to "substantial adverse repercussions on U.S. financial markets and, over time, on the U.S. economy," the minutes said.
Panel members added, however, "that market considerations could not be allowed to jeopardize the effective conduct of a U.S. monetary policy aimed at an optimal performance of the U.S. economy," the minutes said. "Indeed, such a performance would best serve the interests of troubled financial markets and economies abroad."

HEADLINE: Japan Is Still Key To China's Growth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "China's Dynamism, Japan's Inertia" (Op-Ed, June 26): The United States is understandably irritated with Japan's slow economic reforms. But it is one thing to criticize Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for inept leadership and another to belittle Japan, as Stephen S. Roach does. 
 The illusion that China is the geopolitical and economic leader of Asia has led the United States into China's diplomatic blackmail at the expense of relations with Japan. Before President Clinton's visit, China played the yuan card to make Wall Street jittery and manipulated world opinion into thinking China, not the United States, is calling the shots in economic affairs.
China, whose economy cannot grow much without Japanese capital and technology, is begging Japan to bail out its corrupt state-owned businesses and banks. We must ask, Will China's Communist system ever produce world-class manufacturing and trading companies like Sony, Honda and Fuji?

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Midtown Developer Mixes Work With Pleasure

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Betting that renters will venture into a nontraditional residential area for large loft apartments, the owners of 545 West 34th Street are transforming the 88-year-old warehouse into a rental loft building in which tenants can both live and work.
The six-story, red-brick warehouse, being renamed Infinity Court, will have 25 lofts averaging 2,500 square feet each that can be combined to create even larger units. They will offer open layouts that can be designed to have one to four bedrooms, and some will have private elevators, skylights or views of the Hudson River. There will also be 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground and basement levels of the building, between 10th and 11th Avenues. 
 The project is being developed by the Moinian Group of Manhattan at an estimated cost of $8 million to $10 million. The company bought the vacant midblock building, which extends from 34th Street to 35th Street and was once the site of the Hobb Electrical Supply Company, in 1997. Moinian did so because while the building sits across from the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in a mostly commercial and industrial neighborhood, the zoning permits its conversion to residential use and allows tenants "to have their home and office under one roof," said Joseph Moinian, a principal.
Another factor is that this "is one of the few areas left in Manhattan that is not saturated," Mr. Moinian said. And with a strong economy and tight housing market it is also a good time to develop, he said, adding that "the entire West Side from 23d to 42d could be the next area of action."
Right now, however, the development activity is occurring along the perimeter of the nearby Clinton neighborhood, extending from 42d Street east from the Hudson River, up Eighth Avenue to 59th Street. There, thanks to zoning incentives to encourage residential construction, six projects that together total about 3,000 residences have been started in the last two years, according to data from Community Board 4, which monitors growth in the area. There is also development activity in the 20's where old manufacturing buildings are being converted into loft apartments.
"Those areas have a more residential feel to them than the West 30's, which is close to the Lincoln Tunnel and the old Amtrak rail lines, and is a bit like a island," said William H. Kelley, the assistant district manager of Community Board 4. "But if the market stays hot, it is possible to see more development there."
Andrew S. Heiberger, president of Citi Habitats, a rental brokerage in Manhattan and the leasing agent for Infinity Court, said the project was "not all that pioneering" because there are seven existing residential buildings within four blocks, with a total of 1,500 rentals. "And by tapping into the current tight rental market with a product not readily available, large live-work lofts at a good price, we feel the location will attract more tenants," he said, noting that monthly rents for the units, which feature 10.5- to 13-foot-high ceilings, exposed brick walls, marble baths and high-tech wiring, will be $4,000 to $6,000, or $28 to $30 for each square foot on average.
Those prices compare with $40 to $45 a square foot on average for lofts in more traditional neighborhoods like Chelsea, SoHo or TriBeCa, Mr. Heiberger said.
The project is expected to attract young professionals who will share an apartment and more importantly "people with their own businesses who want this kind of hybrid space in which they can live and work," said Robert A. Scaglion, director of marketing at Citi Habitats. In the two weeks since leasing began, leases have been signed for three apartments and are pending on five others, he said.
Steven J. Borne, a 35-year-old film producer and sound designer, is hoping to rent a fifth-floor loft at Infinity Court, which would end a three-month search for what he called "a nice live-work apartment." He said he was "disheartened at the ludicrous rents" asked for apartments that had less space than the two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side he wants to leave.
"This space works for me, and it is a reasonable price," Mr. Borne said of the Infinity Court apartment. "The neighborhood is a little removed, but to me space is more important than location."
The 34th Street site is not the only one at which the Moinian Group is converting an older building to live-work apartments. At 100 John Street downtown, the company has built 221 mostly studio and one-bedroom units, and 45 of the studios have home offices, Mr. Moinian said, noting that 10 of them have been leased since renting began two weeks ago.
Another downtown developer finding success with live-work apartments is Time Equities Inc. In the last two years, the company has converted, or has begun to convert, five small buildings into a total of 76 live-work rental lofts. Rents for the units, which range in size from 750 to 2,100 square feet, are $1,900 to $5,950 a month.
Infinity Court, designed by Gene Kaufman Architects of Manhattan, will have a wrought-iron gated entrance on 34th Street that will open onto a landscaped cobblestone courtyard, created from a former loading area. There will also be a staffed video security system in the building, whose red-brick exterior has been cleaned and repointed as part of the conversion. Planned amenities include a rooftop terrace, Mr. Moinian said. The first tenants are expected to move in on Aug. 1.

HEADLINE: Strong Challenge to Kohl Is Strained by Infighting

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 2

 BODY:
Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democratic challenger to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany's national elections in September, has gone out of his way to polish his image as a leader who would be good for business.
But when Mr. Schroder personally introduced members of his potential future cabinet on Monday in Berlin, one person was conspicuously absent: the man who would be his economics minister. 
 And that was no accident. Jolz Stollmann, a 43-year-old self-made millionaire who started and recently sold his own computer-networking company, had just left for vacation. Before leaving, Mr. Stollmann had announced that he would not play a role in the election campaign or be a spokesman for the Social Democrats' economic program.
"I am not a politician and I'm not participating in the election campaign," Mr. Stollmann said in an interview late last week. "There are others who are more capable."
Less than three months before the vote, Germany's Social Democrats have a strong chance of beating Mr. Kohl and his center-right Christian Democrats for the first time in 16 years.
But the strains between the party's left-leaning traditionalists and Mr. Schroder's comparatively pro-business wing are also becoming more apparent. Germany's powerful union leaders who hold sway in the party have been infuriated by Mr. Stollmann's nomination, accusing him of being hostile to workers. Rank-and-file party members, meanwhile, have been rattled by the elevation of an outsider who plainly comes from a different world.
Mr. Schroder has borrowed unabashedly from the election strategies of Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Clinton, packaging himself as a pro-business Social Democrat who could do more than his conservative rivals to stimulate the German economy and reduce sky-high unemployment.
Naming Mr. Stollmann, a political outsider who brought an aura of Silicon Valley-style success, has been his most visible gesture toward business. A graduate of Harvard Business School who worked for a time at the Boston Consulting Group, Mr. Stollmann started his own company at the age of 29. Last year, the company, Compunet A.G., which provides computer-networking services, had sales of about $1 billion and was recently sold to the General Electric Company of the United States.
Until recently, he had never held any political office and does not belong to a political party. The closest he came to politics was three years ago, when he ran a prominent newspaper campaign to rebut critics who said Germany had become too expensive, lazy and rigid for business.
"A land without a future? Rubbish!" said one ad in bold block letters. "Sleeping government workers? Nonsense!"
Aside from those opinions, Mr. Stollmann is a pragmatist. "The days of ideological battles between left and right are over," he said. "The issue is having the political leadership and the political process that can lead to renewal. I can bring a certain leadership to bring together some of the best minds in the country."
But Mr. Stollmann immediately touched off hostility within the party. By pointedly distancing himself from Social Democratic policies, he aroused suspicions of disloyalty.
As if that were not enough, Mr. Stollmann has been openly skeptical about one of the Social Democrats' core ideas: reducing joblessness through a broad "Alliance for Work" between government, labor and industry. Party officials say political leaders might offer to loosen regulations, and unions would be willing to restrain wage increases in return for more ambitious corporate hiring.
"We do need what Americans might call 'a change coalition,' " Mr. Stollmann said. "But that kind of change coalition cannot decide how many new jobs are going to be created. We are a market economy after all."
German union leaders were outraged by what they took to be Mr. Stollmann's dismissive attitude.
"Mr. Stollmann obviously has a lot to learn, when he discredits the Alliance for Work as meaningless," said Franz-Josef Mollenberg, chairman of the union of Germany's food workers. "We hope he learns quickly. If not, he is the wrong man for the job."
Mr. Schroder has not yet betrayed any concern. "I expressly wanted him to keep his own mind, because I rely on his independence," he said at a party gathering last Sunday.
Mr. Stollmann acknowledged that he has already run afoul of traditionalists. "The people who don't like these ideas are playing the old-fashioned political game," he said. "They are trying to spread distrust between me and the Social Democratic Party members, and I need their trust."

HEADLINE: World Bank, A Bit Nervous, Resumes Aid To Indonesia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
The World Bank resumed aid to Indonesia today for the first time since President Suharto was forced from office. It approved a $1 billion loan and predicted that major industrial nations would soon announce another $6 billion in aid.
The $1 billion loan was part of a $4.5 billion contribution from the World Bank that was promised earlier this year, before the rioting and political upheaval that brought down Mr. Suharto after 32 years in office. 
 But the loan comes at a time when international aid officials describe the country as standing on the edge of an economic abyss: its economy is shrinking faster than anyone expected, its unemployment rate is soaring and its currency is unable to recover from a steep fall in value.
As a result, today's loan is enormously risky, and World Bank officials worry that they may not be able to control how it is spent. They are making only $600 million available immediately. The rest will come later this year, if Indonesia meets a number of the economic commitments it has made since Mr. Suharto's departure.
"We see this loan as a critical component in the overall package of assistance provided by the international community," James Wolfensohn, the World Bank's president, said in a statement. "Its objective is to rebuild confidence and help Indonesia make a new start."
The $1 billion is for reform of the financial and banking systems, and to pay for imports of food and other commodities. Rampant inflation, expected to reach 80 percent this year, has set off much of the social unrest in Indonesia, including attacks on the ethnic Chinese minority, which dominates much of the economy.
A week ago the International Monetary Fund announced it had reached a new accord with Indonesia -- its fourth since October -- that would enable the fund to resume its aid this month, too. Its disbursements were halted in May, as the rioting worsened.
The new accord allows for more social spending, and permits Indonesia to run a significant budget deficit, something the earlier agreements prohibited.
The I.M.F. said last week that the total aid package to Indonesia, about $43 billion, would not be sufficient. It appealed to other countries to come up with another $6 billion to help Indonesia subsidize critical commodities, including food and fuel.
"We are very confident that that package will come," Dennis de Tray, the bank's director for Indonesia, said today. He added that the additional aid would take "weeks, but not many," to put together.
"This is not a time to hold back and wait and see," Mr. de Tray said.
American officials say the United States, which has the largest vote in the World Bank, supported today's decision. It was the first official vote of confidence in the new Government of President B. J. Habibie, a longtime friend of Mr. Suharto's.
But Americans who have dealt with Mr. Habibie and his new Cabinet have come away with mixed impressions.
Several encounters with the President have apparently gone in surprising directions, with Mr. Habibie expounding on unusual economic theories or regaling visitors with accounts of his efforts to build a national airplane for Indonesia, a program that the fund halted.
On the other hand the Finance Minister, Ginandjar Kartasmita, is gaining increasing respect in Washington. He appears serious about wide-ranging economic reforms, officials say, and he is coming to Washington next week to seek more aid.

HEADLINE: G.M. Dealers See Dwindling Supply of Hot Models

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: SYLVANIA, Ohio, July 2

 BODY:
Ask David White Jr., a Chevrolet dealer here, how long he can last during the current strikes against without running out of vehicles, and his initial response is full of confidence: two months, because he has about 220 new cars and trucks in stock and typically sells 110 a month.
But ask about supplies of specific models, and the confidence fades to dismay. There are lots of slow-selling Lumina and Prism sedans, plenty of Astro full-size vans and enough tiny Metro economy cars for at least six months of sales. By contrast, he expects to sell the last of his high-profit Tahoe and Suburban sport utility vehicles and S-10 pickups this weekend, with no prospect of further deliveries until early August even if the strikes end quickly. 
 "You look at your hot products, you're at zero," Mr. White said, holding out the thumb and forefinger of each hand to form little zeros for emphasis.
A shortage of popular models at dealerships now lies at the heart of the troubles facing G.M., the world's largest auto maker. Showdowns with the United Automobile Workers are always costly for auto makers, but G.M. came into the current strikes with extremely low inventories of its most profitable vehicles, and the strikes are obviously making it worse.
So as customers head to showrooms this weekend for the traditionally busy Fourth of July auto sales, they are likely to find the most popular G.M. models in short supply, with few combinations of color and options available. Discounts are evaporating, pushing up the prices that car buyers actually pay. And dealers for Ford, Chrysler and foreign auto makers are trying to woo G.M. customers by offering wider selections, but seldom at lower prices. Even used-car prices are climbing, as dealers flock to auctions, desperate to buy late-model cars to keep their lots from looking empty.
Because of a price war this spring, G.M. had been offering $500 to $1,000 discount coupons on even its most popular models but allowed these to expire on Tuesday night. Chrysler officials have already indicated that their similar coupons will expire on Monday, and Ford is likely to terminate its coupon program on Tuesday. Auction prices for used 1996, 1997 and 1998 cars have already risen by hundreds of dollars, with the few used 1998 models on the market now selling for close to the original sticker price even though they have a few thousand miles on them.
The strikes at two G.M. auto parts factories in Flint, Mich., have forced G.M. to close 26 of its 29 North American assembly plants, so customers who want to order a precise combination of paint color and options from the factory face months of delay -- or must compromise and pick from dealers' dwindling selections.
"What you see is what you get," said Jim Yark, an Oldsmobile dealer in nearby Toledo, as he surveyed the 78 new cars and light trucks on his lot -- less than a third of his usual supply, and only enough for another three weeks of sales, he calculated.
Many G.M. dealers also have franchises for other auto makers, and are using their Ford, Dodge and other dealerships to woo customers unable to find the right G.M. vehicle. The Burdick Companies, a chain of 18 dealerships in central New York, including a Buick dealership, has culled from state auto registration records a list of all nearby owners of G.M. full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and plans to mail them brochures offering big Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles and Dodge Ram pickup trucks instead.
"Our strategy is to hit at the weakness," said Louis Bregou, the group's director of operations, while acknowledging that the aggressive strategy could produce a shortage later this summer of the popular Dodge light trucks. "We could be out of Durangos and Ram trucks by Labor Day."
The strikes come at a time of record sales for G.M., which announced June results by model today: sales of each of its full-size sport utility vehicle models were the highest ever in June, and its overall light-truck sales have set industry records for the last four consecutive months. The record sales have helped G.M. clear out 1998 models before the 1999 models are introduced, which traditionally happens in late September, but G.M. has been too successful for its own good. Now the auto maker finds itself running out of popular models even as the economy is booming, unemployment is low and people are buying lots of light trucks.
With experience gained from more than a dozen other G.M. strikes over the last five years, Wall Street analysts thought they could estimate with confidence the company's losses from work stoppages and put the damage to G.M.'s after-tax earnings in the second quarter at up to $1 billion. But G.M. said on Tuesday that its actual losses were $1.18 billion, nearly 20 percent higher than Wall Street's highest estimates, mainly because sales of light trucks had dropped especially fast.
Ronald L. Zarrella, G.M.'s group vice president for marketing, tried to reassure Wall Street and vehicle shoppers on Wednesday that G.M. dealers still had ample inventories. G.M. has canceled low-profit sales to car rental companies and other fleets, and its dealerships' remaining inventories of cars and light trucks are equal to 70 days of retail sales, he said.
But such figures mask wide differences in the availability of particular models, as well as big gaps among dealerships. Small cars, on which G.M. loses money, are still plentiful, but full-size sport utility vehicles, on which G.M. makes up to $10,000 apiece, are very scarce. Also, some dealerships that started the summer with unusually large inventories are less worried than dealerships that tried to match up orders and sales more closely and now find themselves with little to sell.
In normal times, dealers sell scarce models to one another at close to invoice prices. But this informal system has broken down now, with dealers nationwide saying in interviews this week that they are hoarding their remaining vehicles and generally selling only to retail customers who pay close to the full sticker price.
The uneven distribution of vehicles poses a problem for G.M. because customer loyalty to dealerships has been its greatest strength. More than any other domestic or foreign auto maker, G.M. relies on sales to previous owners of G.M. vehicles, a legacy of the days in the 1960's and 70's when G.M. controlled half the market. Very few owners of foreign cars, or even owners of other domestic brands, tend to switch to G.M., which is one reason why its market share has been slowly diminishing for a quarter of a century. But now some of those loyal G.M. customers are coming into dealerships that offer an increasingly limited selection.
Drive up and down Central Avenue in nearby Toledo, the main street for auto dealerships, and at first glance nothing is wrong. But on closer inspection, some of the dealerships are suffering. Yark Oldsmobile has even resorted to one of the oldest tricks in the dealer business: parking its remaining cars and trucks with wider spaces between them, so as to reduce the amount of empty asphalt visible from the road.
Mr. Yark also canceled virtually all of his advertising on Wednesday after realizing that his inventory had been depleted by a burst of sales early this week as G.M.'s incentives were expiring. "We realized we didn't have any cars," he said, surveying the nearly empty storage lot behind his showroom.
G.M. is struggling to hold on to loyal customers. Paul E. Eberlein, G.M.'s director of leasing, said that customers with car leases expiring now would be allowed to extend their leases at the same monthly rate until an ample selection of vehicles became available again. G.M. has also been maintaining stockpiles of replacement parts for warranty work and repairs at dealerships; only a few parts, notably hoods and fenders for full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, are in short supply.
Some customers may wait for G.M. to resume full production. Terry Mantey, a retired Chrysler worker here in Sylvania who only buys Chevrolet cars because he admires their durability, shopped for a Malibu at Dave White Chevrolet today but said that he would wait for the strikes to end if he could not find the right combination of color and options at the right price.
But at mostly deserted dealerships here and in Toledo today, many dealers shared the worry expressed by Mr. Zarrella on Wednesday: that many of the customers would refuse to wait and start trying other dealerships. "Once you lose them," Mr. Zarrella also warned, "it is extremely hard to win them back."

HEADLINE: Mayor Promotes Budget Director To Deputy Mayor for Operations

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday promoted his budget director, Joseph J. Lhota, to Deputy Mayor for Operations, the position that has traditionally been second in command at City Hall.
Mr. Lhota succeeded Randy M. Mastro, who resigned on Monday to return to private law practice. 
 The appointment of Mr. Lhota, a central player in the recent budget skirmishes with the City Council, is not likely to push the Giuliani administration in any major new direction.
The deputy mayor for operations is responsible for the day-to-day management of government, negotiating the city budget and making deals with Council leaders. As the Mayor's most trusted aide and a sort of alter ego, he fights for the his causes in televised debates and hammers at issues with reporters inside his office at City Hall's western end.
The predecessors to Mr. Lhota in the job were Mr. Mastro, a registered Democrat who was a protege from Mr. Giuliani's days as a Federal prosecutor, and Peter J. Powers, a lifelong friend of the Mayor.
"My job is to carry out the goals of the Mayor and his strategic objectives," said Mr. Lhota, who like Mr. Giuliani is a Republican.
Among the more immediate thoughts on Mr. Lhota's mind yesterday was what shade to repaint his new office. The deputy mayor for operations is the only one of the four deputy mayors to have an office in the City Hall building.
It was unclear whether Mr. Lhota would inherit all the responsibilities held by Mr. Mastro or whether some might be given to other members of Mr. Giuliani's inner circle, which includes Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development; Dennison Young Jr., the chief counsel; Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser, and Cristyne F. Lategano, the communications director. Mr. Giuliani gave no hint yesterday of how power might be divided, saying only, "I will leave it up to them."
The Mayor did not name a successor to Mr. Lhota yesterday.
Before joining the administration in 1994, Mr. Lhota, 43, worked for several years as an investment banker specializing in municipal finance. He was born on City Island in the Bronx, and his father was a New York City police lieutenant.
Mr. Lhota graduated from Georgetown University and received a master's degree in business administration from Harvard. His wife, Tamra Roberts Lhota, is a fund-raiser for Mr. Giuliani and the president of York City Public/Private Initiatives, a private business group. The couple have a 7-year-old daughter, Kathryn.

HEADLINE: Anti-Sweatshop Coalition Finds Itself at Odds on Garment Factory Code

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Eight months past its self-imposed deadline to set up a code of conduct for apparel factories, a Presidential task force remains at stalemate over a number of pivotal issues, including the frequency with which those factories ought to be inspected and whether any of them ought to be in China.
The working group's corporate members, including Liz Claiborne, Nike and Reebok, are now fighting several proposals recently put forward by its human rights organizations and labor unions, and the split is such that several members warn that the whole effort may soon fall apart. 
 The task force, the White House Apparel Industry Partnership, has 18 members: clothing manufacturers, labor unions, and consumer and human rights groups. It is trying to set up a system of voluntary labor standards, at home and abroad, that will assure consumers that the clothes and the footwear they buy was not made in sweatshops. It envisions an arrangement in which manufacturers that met the standards would be entitled to stitch certifying labels inside their products.
At a White House ceremony 15 months ago, all sides announced an agreement setting maximum work hours (60 a week), a minimum working age (14) and wage guidelines, varying by country, for thousands of factories used by American apparel companies in the United States and overseas. But the group's corporate members remain at odds with the unions and human rights groups on monitoring and other issues.
Deliberations of the task force are confidential, but a copy of the proposals recently set forth by the unions and human rights groups was sent anonymously to The New York Times by a member that, some on both sides suggested, wanted the debate aired in public as a way of pressuring the industry.
One of those proposals called for more stringent monitoring than the companies want, demanding that independent inspectors examine 30 percent of a given manufacturer's plants each year, twice the rate suggested by the corporate members.
Another proposal concerned a suggested study of apparel wages around the world. While the two sides agree that the United States Labor Department should perform such a study, the labor and human rights groups say it should focus on whether those wages are high enough to meet workers' basic needs -- that is, what is called a "living wage."
The industry representatives suggest that the proposal for such a focus is intended to embarrass them, and note that in the earlier agreement they pledged to pay at least the local minimum wage, though not necessarily a living wage, in their overseas factories. The companies also dislike a proposal under which the Fair Labor Association, the organization that would be created to oversee the code of conduct, would examine whether the factories were paying a living wage.
China is also a subject of contention. The nonindustry members have proposed that in any country that does not allow employees freedom of association and collective bargaining, employers shall nonetheless take steps to insure that those rights can be exercised. This proposal says that if, despite such efforts, no participating company can demonstrate progress in guaranteeing its employees those rights, then the Fair Labor Association can determine that producing garments in that country is inconsistent with the code of conduct.
Such a determination might not require companies to leave, but it would certainly apply pressure on them to do so, since they could otherwise no longer assure consumers that they were complying with the code. The nation's largest apparel union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, a member of the task force, has long backed such a proposal, aimed largely at China, which has large numbers of factories that turn out clothes for the American market.
In light of disagreements like these, a representative of one noncorporate member said, "We're teetering on the edge of collapse."
But Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which is also a member, was less pessimistic.
"We are still engaged in a process about which there are significant areas of agreement, and a few key areas where there are real differences," Mr. Posner said. "I remain cautiously optimistic that we're going to find a path that leads to an agreement."
Roberta Karp, co-chairwoman of the task force and general counsel for Liz Claiborne, criticized the disclosure of the recent proposals and, particularly with regard to the China proposal, suggested that some members were pushing a protectionist trade agenda.
"It is regrettable," she said, "that someone chose to try to leverage through the press a proposal that would impede the mission of the Apparel Industry Partnership. However, we believe many groups remain willing to make further progress by focusing on improving working conditions rather than supporting this proposal, essentially a trade policy that would force companies to pull out of countries like China."
On several occasions, the task force has nearly collapsed, only to lurch forward and reach agreement on thorny issues, like the makeup of the board of the Fair Labor Association. The labor and human rights groups had demanded a majority of board members, while the industry insisted on 50-50. Ultimately there was agreement that the industry and nonindustry sides would have equal representation, with the chairman chosen by both sides.
When the task force reaches an impasse, its members often ask Gene Sperling, economic adviser to President Clinton, to jawbone the two sides. Asked about the latest stalemate, Mr. Sperling said:
"When you're trying to put together a novel and indeed historic partnership, you have to expect it's going to be a rocky road every step of the way. But I'm still confident that we'll get there."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE REPUBLICANS;
G.O.P. Delivers Unusual Praise On Clinton Trip

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Even before President Clinton's return from China, many prominent Republicans concede that the trip has been a political success that could deprive their party of a potent election-year issue.
In a series of interviews Republicans said they still had serious questions about the wisdom of Mr. Clinton's policy approaches toward Beijing. 
 But as a political matter, there seems to be a consensus among Republicans that, at least for now, Mr. Clinton has overcome fears among Democrats that the trip would expose the President to damaging attacks on issues like human rights, the exporting of satellite technology to China and campaign finance irregularities.
"I think it was a huge success," said Jack F. Kemp, the Republican Vice Presidential nominee in 1996, who faults the President for seeming to side with China against Japan. "That presents a problem to those Republicans or conservatives who want to make it an issue. I can't imagine that there's any great political benefit to be derived, because the President handled himself very well."
James R. Lilley, the Ambassador to China in the Bush Administration, put it this way: "Clinton got control of the agenda. He ran it like a campaign. And he made it into a political success story."
Republicans say the President gave a polished performance throughout the trip and avoided gaffes. His defense of human rights, and criticism of the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square, at a news conference with President Jiang Zemin, struck the right note, the Republicans said. Mr. Clinton also defended religious freedom in China and Tibet, as well as economic liberalization.
Mr. Lilley said he had advised Republican Congressional leaders to hold their fire and rethink how to handle China as a political issue. "I've counseled them to pull back on this one. Don't hit Clinton at his high point -- or it's going to sound like sour grapes." But Mr. Lilley did say he thought that the President had "swept under the rug" the issue of Chinese military modernization."
Weeks ago, House Speaker Newt Gingrich called on Mr. Clinton to postpone the trip until the Justice Department had determined whether two American companies gave sensitive missile information to Beijing in 1996.
But speaking to reporters on Wednesday in San Antonio, where he was attending a Republican fund-raising event, he praised Mr. Clinton. "I think the President did a pretty good job talking on Chinese radio and TV," Mr. Gingrich said. "It's less expensive to be friends than to be enemies."
Rich Galen, a phrase maker to the Speaker, said: "They set the bar so low for success that the arrival ceremony looked like a limbo dance, and he did better than expectations. You have to say this has been a successful trip for the President."
One explanation for Mr. Gingrich's praise is that he has been trying to repair relations with corporate executives who have soured on giving money to Republicans, and who have championed intensified trade with China.
The positive notices from Mr. Clinton's trip have already affected Republican legislative strategy. The Senate had been expected to vote next week on a package of amendments sponsored by Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, that among other features would deny visas to Chinese officials involved in forced-abortion policies and prohibit new American-backed international loans to China.
But today Senate officials said that the vote had been put off by at least a week, partly out of concern that the amendments might not win a positive reception in the afterglow of the summit.
The upbeat reaction even led White House officials to take the unusual step of pointing out an editorial on Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page is better known for harsh rebukes of the President. The White House communications director, Ann F. Lewis, said she was so stunned by the unexpected praise that "I looked again -- it did not say April 1."
The editorial said, "So we may break convention among the President's critics by saying we think Mr. Clinton has been doing well in China."
The Journal backed off today in an editorial, accusing Mr. Clinton of "kowtowing" to China over Taiwan.
Many Republicans, and Democrats, say they do not expect the relative silence on Mr. Clinton and China to last. Several Republicans said that would depend in part on what polls show about the public reaction to the trip.
And some Republicans may be more willing to speak out against Mr. Clinton after his arrival in Washington -- he is due back early Saturday morning -- out of a tradition that it is inappropriate to denounce a President while he is overseas.
Although most polling organizations are waiting until the end of the trip to question Americans about whether it was a success, surveys beforehand showed wide public support for the trip. A New York Times/ CBS News Poll early last month found that about half of Republicans and two-thirds of Democrats said that Mr. Clinton should go to China.
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, the Republican of Middletown, N.Y., who heads the International Relations Committee, said it was too early to know how the trip would play politically.
"The opportunity to talk to the Chinese people without any restrictions and focusing on the rights of individuals was a plus," Mr. Gilman said. "The key question is how much else was accomplished? The Chinese achieved a number of important goals at our expense."
The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, said he believed that Republicans could eventually score political points over China.
"It will take time for the splash of the trip and the media coverage to wear off and for the real substance of what went on to surface," Mr. Nicholson said. "As that happens and people begin to see the way he gave away the store, they're not going to like it."
Mr. Nicholson said he was deeply concerned by the President's comments about Taiwanese reunification with China, the fund-raising scandals, Mr. Clinton's failure to meet dissidents and the laxity of China's agreement not to point nuclear missiles at the United States. "It was all carrot and no stick," he said.
Still, as with many other Republicans, Mr. Nicholson's language was tamer than before the trip, when he said the President would "walk on the blood of those brave pro-democracy protesters."
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, countered that Mr. Clinton's performance had exceeded his expectations. Mr. Romer had been particularly concerned, he said, about how the President would be perceived at the arrival ceremonies at Tiananmen Square, site of the Government's bloody crackdown in 1989.
"I didn't know how he would perform personally," Mr. Romer said. "There was tension with the Tiananmen Square thing. I was apprehensive."
But he said of Republicans: "I think they've lost it as an issue. People understand that one-quarter of the world's population is sitting in the middle of that Asian economy. We've got to know them better, and they've got to be partners of ours."
A Republican media consultant, Michael Murphy, predicted that the trip would provide nothing more than a short-term boost for Mr. Clinton, saying: "It's not unlike the proverbial Chinese dinner -- short-term in its splendor. It was a successful photo op, which is what they wanted."

HEADLINE: June Job Data Show Growth Eased a Little

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The hot United States economy is showing signs of cooling, but by only a few degrees. In June, the Labor Department reported yesterday, unemployment edged up to 4.5 percent and job growth slowed.
There were other signs of moderation. Total hours worked were virtually flat in June, a clear indication that the nation's output of goods and services is growing much more slowly than in recent quarters. And hourly pay rose by a mere penny, suggesting that wage inflation, while higher than a year ago, was not accelerating. 
 The slowdown, however, is from an exceptionally torrid pace. Payrolls grew by 205,000 last month, compared with more than 300,000 in each of the two previous months.
By any historical standard, job creation remains robust and unemployment is very low indeed. As recently as a year ago, joblessness stood at 5 percent.
"Coming after such phenomenal numbers, the June number looks weaker," said Jeffrey A. Frankel, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "But on some objective scale, it's very positive."
The drag on the job market and the economy mostly resulted from a production slowdown in manufacturing as well as a temporary decline in government jobs. Manufacturing payrolls, which have been flat or down for months, fell by 29,000 in June, after dropping by 22,000 in May. The culprits: superabundant inventories, the initial effects of the strikes against General Motors and other labor strife, and deepening economic woes in Asia.
But elsewhere hiring was robust. The service sector -- from consulting firms and investment banks to hotel chains and shopping malls -- continued to scoop up workers, as did the temporary-help industry, usually a harbinger of future job creation. As Katherine Abraham, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, noted, hiring by the private sector matched the average pace for the last 12 months -- an exceptionally good stretch for job growth.
Investors took the report in stride. They nudged bond prices higher, but pushed stock prices down modestly. Investors have been fretting that continued strength in the labor market will prompt the Federal Reserve to slow the economy by raising interest rates. Despite the slowdown, the pace of job creation is still too fast for the Fed, which does not want to see the unemployment rate fall much further.
"Job growth is slowing to a more comfortable pace, but it's still not within Alan Greenspan's preferred range," said M. Carey Leahey, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm.
The Fed chairman's comfort zone, as Mr. Greenspan pointedly hinted in testimony last October, is closer to 100,000 than 200,000 jobs monthly.
Labor Department officials cautioned yesterday against reading too much into the rise in unemployment. June is the month in which millions of students in search of summer jobs temporarily join the labor force, an influx that often results in weird gyrations in employment and unemployment as measured in the department's survey of households. In June of last year, for example, the unemployment rate also ticked up two-tenths of 1 percent, without signaling an upward trend in joblessness.
And business executives do not see much slackening in the demand for workers, young or old. "I don't see any weakness in the labor market," said Mitchell Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower Inc., the nation's biggest provider of temporary help. Manpower's survey of employers' hiring plans for July through September shows further expansion. The National Federation of Independent Business, meanwhile, reported that its June survey found that a record 31 percent of small companies had job openings that they were unable to fill.
Nearly a third of June's decline in manufacturing jobs reflected the initial effects of the General Motors strike, which has now idled more than 160,000 workers. The jobs survey was taken the week of June 12, when 3,000 G.M. workers were on strike and another 6,000 others had been furloughed. If the strike lasts through mid-July, as many expect, the July employment report will be sharply affected.
The deepening crisis in Asia, which has strengthened the dollar and battered demand, also hurt factory employment last month in several industries that sell to Asian customers or compete with Asian rivals. Payrolls were down by 1,000 in heavy machinery; 6,000 in apparel and 4,000 in electronic components, where there was also a strike. The weakness could well continue; the Commerce Department reported yesterday that factory orders fell a sharp 1.6 percent in May after rising seven-tenths of 1 percent in April.
The June decline in government payrolls, especially at the state and local level, was probably temporary. To be sure, the Federal Civil Service has been shrinking for years and will no doubt continue to do so. But a transit strike in Philadelphia accounted for the dip in state jobs. And June is the month that hundreds of thousands of teachers go on summer break; the timing always changes a bit from year to year, so attempts to make seasonal adjustments in the data are rarely perfect.
'You wouldn't want to read too much into that decline," said Tom Nardone, chief of labor force statistics at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Outside of manufacturing and government, things look pretty good. Things are growing."
Builders added another 20,000 carpenters, bricklayers and the like; they would probably have hired even more if there had not been heavy rains in the Midwest last month. And the services juggernaut -- data processing, consulting, engineering, health care, health supply, temporary help, retail, finance, insurance, real estate, trucking, wholesale trade, utilities -- added 215,000 net payroll jobs.
How much the economy will slow is a matter of great debate. So far, consumers and businesses continue to spend freely while industry is putting the brakes on production. The question is whether the production cutbacks will continue long enough to bring job creation to a crawl and to rein in spending, or whether spending will stay strong enough to revive production eventually.
"That's the issue," said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs. "Nobody knows for sure. It depends on how long the production weakness lasts."
One damper that seems to be correcting itself faster than expected is the inventory pileup; yesterday's Commerce Department report showed that manufacturers' inventories hardly grew in May. As Mr. Dudley put it, "Manufacturers are responding rapidly to the inventory situation."

HEADLINE: How a Home's Sale Led to Discovery of 2 Murders

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

 BODY:
For nearly 14 years, the bodies of two murder victims, a young man and a teen-age girl, were hidden in a crude and shallow grave beneath the crawl space of a tiny Cape Cod house near Atlantic City. The homicides might not have been discovered, the authorities said yesterday, but for the sale of the house and the new owner's plans to remodel it.
After detectives had spent two days digging and sifting dirt from the crawl space and backyard at the house, the Atlantic County Prosecutor, Jeffrey S. Blitz, said yesterday that two skeletons, shreds of clothing, three bullets, a baseball bat and a wallet were found in the three-foot grave beneath 402 Ireland Avenue in Northfield, N.J. Mr. Blitz said his investigators were satisfied that there were no other bodies buried on the property. 
 The former owner of the house, Ernest Ireland, 51, an unemployed bachelor who has been living in a trailer park in Pleasantville, N.J., has been charged with murder and is being held in $350,000 bail at the Atlantic County Jail.
He was charged late Monday, only a few hours after the new owner of the house, Bruce Trielo, began excavations in the crawl space and turned up a thigh bone. Mr. Trielo, who had bought the house as an investment in late May, was planning to enlarge it, first by putting in a full basement, Mr. Blitz said.
The house at 402 Ireland Avenue was the first of six built on the tiny dead-end street. It was named after Mr. Ireland's forebears who were its first settlers, said a woman who has lived on a nearby street for 33 years. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Ireland had lived alone since his mother died of cancer in the mid-1970's. "You saw him alone all the time, walking or riding a bike," she said. "He never talked to anybody, and I passed him almost every day on the street."
Ireland Avenue was an odd mix of images yesterday. Bricks and cinder blocks brought in for the remodeling were piled outside Mr. Trielo's house, next to mounds of freshly dug dirt. Across the street, deliverymen came with supplies for a Fourth of July weekend picnic.
Several neighbors declined to talk about Mr. Ireland or the murders.
The prosecutor refused to say yesterday whether Mr. Ireland had made a statement. But, he said, his staff believed that the murders occurred in Mr. Ireland's kitchen in late January 1985 and that Mr. Ireland dragged the bodies outside and hid them in the freshly dug grave in the crawl space.
One of the victims has been identified as Barry Dallman, of Pleasantville, which is adjacent to Northfield. He died of a gunshot to the spine at age 21, Mr. Blitz said. Mr. Dallman was identified through papers found in the wallet discovered in the grave. Mr. Blitz described Mr. Dallman only as an acquaintance of Mr. Ireland's. He declined to discuss a possible motive for the murders.
The teen-age girl has not been identified. She died of blows to the head, Mr. Blitz said. The county medical examiner has determined, through examination of a pelvic bone, that she was in her early teens, the prosecutor said. He said detectives believed that the remains might be those of a 14-year-old girl reported missing by her foster parents shortly after they dropped her off at Pleasantville High School on Jan. 24, 1985. She is thought to have been Mr. Dallman's girlfriend, Mr. Blitz said.
Detectives are now searching the Atlantic City area for dentists who may have treated the girl and kept dental records.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Judgment In Beijing

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The President stood to speak to about 100 dissidents gathered in the U.S. Embassy. He said this to them:
"While we press for human rights through diplomatic channels you press with your very lives, day in, day out, year after year, risking your jobs, your homes, your all." 
 And then this: "Coming here, being with you, looking into your faces, I have to believe the history of this troubled century will indeed be redeemed in the eyes of God and man."
President Reagan said many things during his visit to Moscow that May of 1988, but those passages will be remembered by fighters for freedom willing to risk their own -- and by those privileged by their own liberty to help them.
A decade later, President Clinton, in Beijing, could make no such statements. This President, born and raised under liberty, elected in liberty, had no meetings with dissidents, spoke no words about political prisoners by the thousands existing on gruel and beatings, and workers by the millions slaving in "re-education" prison-factories.
This President, who proclaims love for children and women's rights, did not mention what confronts every Chinese woman -- the need for official approval to deliver a child. He did not mention the punishment for carrying to birth more than the allotted one, or sometimes two: forced abortion. It may take a village to raise a child, as Mrs. Clinton wrote, but in the China they admire it takes only one official to order the child extinguished in the womb; no choice.
Beijing gave Mr. Clinton air time before censoring replays. When he called his friends in the U.S. to ask howmIdoin' back there, they said he was a smash. He was; the U.S. press has been spun so often that now it sometimes just spins itself. The Clinton "openness" we heard and read about was to candor as Torquemada to tolerance.
He arrived bearing payoff to China. He offered the chance to make Tibet disappear forever into China, without any Beijing concessions. President Jiang Zemin of China said he would talk with the Dalai Lama, maybe. The Dalai Lama praised both men. He fears that if the Chinese never allow him to return to Tibet, when he dies Beijing will choose and rear the next Dalai Lama or simply eliminate Tibetan Buddhism completely.
In Tibet, dreams of national and religious freedom will not long survive any Clinton-Jiang deal, nor will Tibet's international support groups. But perhaps at least the honored memory of the half-century struggle by Tibetans and the Dalai Lama against genocide will endure despite decisions that China and the U.S. force upon them.
In the "debate" heard by Chinese, it was President Jiang who openly laid down realities to them and the world. The Communist justification for the Tiananmen slaughter stands; objecting Chinese can go to jail. On foreign complaints about human rights: None of your business. And nothing, particularly not the presence of this U.S. President, can save a Chinese dissident from arrest when the police choose.
Mr. Clinton -- he concentrated on concealment. When he had the chance to use public time to speak up against the arrests of Roman Catholic and Protestant clergymen and congregants who do not accept the official "patriotic" churches or Beijing's dictates about liturgy, sermons, clerical appointments and disavowal by Catholics of papal authority and appointments, the President was mute. Nor did he speak of the millions who attend underground "house churches" rather than accept Beijing's rule over God.
And in all those public meetings Mr. Clinton kept his mouth shut about Chinese sales of nuclear weaponry, and Beijing's thefts of American missile technology.
On the Chinese economy, he said nothing about the various special efficiencies that so smartly increase production, profits and exports: 17-cent-an-hour labor, no unions, iron factory discipline, forced labor, the waiting cell -- all now handsomely financed by Western investment, and imports.
A smash. The Beijing-U.S. axis was forged, based on Politburo concepts about the role of human rights and political democracy: zero.
And then -- then, Mr. Clinton announced that China's economic and "freedom" course was "morally right." He said that. The President will go home. On Sundays he will go to church. The Bible will be in his hand, and on his soul will be that judgment.

HEADLINE: Hop On, Hop Off: The Unlimited Metrocard Arrives

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A new era for the New York City's mass transit riders begins at midnight tonight, when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's unlimited-ride Metrocard passes go on sale, offering what transit officials hope will be a huge new incentive to use subways and buses.
Priced at $17 for a 7-day pass and $63 for a 30-day pass, the new cards could yield significant savings for regular users of the city's mass transit network. 
 But more fundamentally, officials and advocates for riders are hoping that the passes will transform the way New Yorkers use and think about mass transit and create a much more mobile city, where people hop on and off buses and subways with abandon because they no longer have to worry about the cost. New York's century-old transit system is the last major one in the country to begin offering offer unlimited-ride passes.
Advocates for riders have questioned whether the system is prepared to absorb the 100 million new rides a year the passes are expected to attract, an increase of 6 percent over today's levels. They contend that the authority has not added enough service to keep pace with an 18 percent increase in weekday ridership over the last two years.
But the authority maintains that it will be able to add enough buses and subways should they be needed.
The passes, which were announced by Gov. George E. Pataki in December, nearly complete a series of fare breaks that the transportation authority began last year with free bus-to-subway transfers in July and continued with an 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 bulk discount in January.
Those discounts, along with the city's booming economy, have fueled a 9 percent increase in bus and subway ridership since last year, to 5.5 million rides a day. A one-day unlimited pass, priced at $4, is scheduled to be offered in the fall.
The passes are also expected to benefit Mr. Pataki, who is running for re-election and whose best-known piece of transit policy until a year ago was to reduce state aid to the system in 1995, forcing cuts in service and an increase in the fare, to $1.50 per token from $1.25.
Mr. Pataki said yesterday that he expected the benefits of the discounts to be felt beyond the confines of the buses and subways.
"We know it's going to be good for the economy, we know it's great for the fare payer and we know it's going to be outstanding for the environment," he said. "Everyone's been talking about how congested the city is with too many cars, and by offering these options we will continue to get people out of their cars and onto mass transit."
Interviews with riders this week found them generally welcoming the new cards, with some planning to buy one pass as a trial to see whether they get their money's worth.
"Maybe it would stop me from taking so many cabs," said a 46-year-old advertising buyer on the D train platform at 42d Street who gave her name only as Valerie and who said she was returning to work after a lunchtime appointment. "It has to do with commitment. Once I've made that $17 investment up front, I see it as a free situation, rather than a $5 cab ride minus the dollar-and-a-half public transportation."
Alberta Johnson, who lives in Harlem and works in a print shop in Greenwich Village and who also takes the subway frequently to go shopping or to the movies, was certain the pass was for her.
"I know I'll use it enough," said Ms. Johnson, who got off the A train at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on her way to celebrate her birthday in Atlantic City. "I usually buy my $15 Metrocard every Friday for the week," she said, "but a lot of the time I have to get a new one sooner so I can get around."
The new passes look identical to the pay-per-ride version of the Metrocard, the now-familiar gold card with a magnetic strip that allows fares to be deducted electronically at the turnstile or the fare box and is now used to pay for more than 70 percent of all rides.
They new cards will be sold at all 468 subway stations and at more than 3,200 newsstands, delis and other stores outside the system, though officials said that some stores would sell only the 7-day card, and not the 30-day card, because they want repeat business from their customers.
Passes bought at token booths must be purchased with cash, but the authority expects that in the fall, it will begin to introduce vending machines that take credit or automated teller cards.
The pass is good from the moment it is first used until midnight 7 or 30 days later, depending on the kind of pass. A 30-day pass does not expire automatically at the end of a calendar month.
The only restriction on the passes is that they cannot be used more than once within 18 minutes, except for transfers between buses and subways. This is to prevent people from passing the card to friends and swiping several riders through the turnstiles at once. But there is nothing to prevent riders from lending their passes to others when they are not using them.
Holders of monthly passes on the M.T.A.'s railroads -- Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road -- will be able to buy a new version of the pass with an unlimited bus and subway pass on the back of the card.
If the pass is stolen or lost, it cannot be replaced, so the authority is urging riders to treat the pass as if it were cash.
Whether the pass is a worthwhile investment will depend on how often it is used. A commuter who takes only 5 round trips a week, or 10 rides, would be better off with an 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 Metrocard, which effectively reduces the fare to $1.36. At 10 rides a week, a 7-day pass holder would pay about $1.70 a ride and a 30-day pass holder about $1.54 a ride.
But anyone who typically takes even a couple of extra trips a week would save money with the pass. Someone who takes seven round trips a week on a 7-day pass would pay $1.21 per ride, while a 30-day pass holder taking seven round trips a week would effectively pay $1.09 a ride.
Combined with a Federal benefit known in this region as Transitchek, which was modified last month to let companies convert up to $65 a month of their employees' pretax pay into transit benefits, the passes could easily reduce the effective cost of a ride to less than a dollar, where it has not been since 1986.
For someone in the 28 percent tax bracket, a $63 pass bought with Transitchek would in effect cost only $45, the amount the worker would otherwise have taken home after taxes were deducted.
Larry Filler, the executive director of Transitcenter, which administers the Transitchek program, said that while 7,000 companies now offer Transitchek, which is also good on trains and buses in the suburbs around New York, 2,000 more had contacted the center since last month seeking information on the program.
While there has been some concern that less-affluent riders would not buy the passes because of the up-front cost, officials in other cities have found that such passes are used just as widely by people at all economic levels.
"Lower-income people realize that it's the cheapest way to do it," said Daniel Fleishman, a senior consultant at Multisystems Inc., a transit consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., "and those are the people who use transit most because they use it not just for work but for all trips."
And while riders are expected to take a while to get used to the passes, Christopher P. Boylan, a deputy executive director of the transportation authority, said he was sure they would embrace them just as they embraced the Metrocard itself as soon as the free transfers started.
"For all the things people used to say about how attached people were to their tokens, now 71 percent of people have abandoned them," Mr. Boylan said, adding that Metrocards are now so entrenched that he sees them sticking out of pockets in clothing display windows and inserted as props in wallets sold on the street. "The Metrocard has become part of New York culture, and once people recognize the benefits of the pass, it will be the same thing."

HEADLINE: African Opportunity

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
For the Western Governments that have watched with dismay for the last three decades as much of Africa suffered through chaos and bankruptcy, the news from Nigeria today is the most gratifying from that continent since the establishment of a multiracial Government in South Africa under Nelson Mandela.
If Nigeria could take even a few steps along the path toward democracy, as implied by the reported pledge of its new military Government to release all political prisoners, it could encourage other African governments to follow. 
 It might enable Nigeria itself, a country with real possibilities, to begin a comeback from decades of corruption, dictatorship, ethnic tension and war. And it might ease the fears of other West African leaders that political unrest and economic deprivation would spill into their countries.
When President Clinton and an entourage of more than 800 swept through Africa last spring, they flew over Nigeria twice but never landed.
That pained the Administration's Africa experts, from Assistant Secretary of State Susan E. Rice on down. Nigeria counts. It is the most important country in sub-Saharan Africa, with the possible exception of South Africa. It is big, more than twice the size of California. Its 110 million people make it Africa's most populous nation. It is the fifth-largest supplier of oil to the United States.
But a visit from Mr. Clinton was out of the question, Ms. Rice said at the time. The Government of Gen. Sani Abacha, one of the world's most repressive, annulled democratic elections in 1993, executed nine environmental activists in 1995 and filled jails with its opponents, including Moshood K. O. Abiola, the apparent victor in the 1993 vote.
Suspended from the Commonwealth, subjected to sanctions by the United States and others, Nigeria dug in its heels. Outsiders' leverage ranged from limited to nonexistent, and no early change seemed possible. On a visit to Nigeria, Pope John Paul II appealed to General Abacha to free the political prisoners and got exactly nowhere.
The Clinton Administration sent signals to General Abacha that it would not accept as a reform measure his plan to run as a civilian in elections planned this August. But then Mr. Clinton grew so frustrated with the lack of movement that he said in Cape Town that "if he stands for election, we hope he will stand as a civilian."
That apparent concession brought no constructive response, either.
Then General Abacha died suddenly of a heart attack on June 8, to be succeeded by his colleague in the ruling junta, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. And General Abubakar, to the surprise of Nigerians and diplomats alike, proved in many ways to be different from his predecessor.
Sensing an opening, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, visited Nigeria this week, met with Mr. Abiola in jail on Tuesday and declared today that "all political detainees will be released and the Government will make an announcement at the appropriate time."
Mr. Annan also said that Mr. Abiola was ready to relinquish his claim to the Presidency. Diplomats in Washington and London suggested that the Secretary General had reiterated to Mr. Abiola the private urgings of Western nations, including the United States, that he pledge to cooperate with General Abubakar as part of a face-saving arrangement that would grant amnesty to all political prisoners.
A high-ranking British delegation, headed by Tony Lloyd, a minister in the Foreign Office, visited Nigeria last weekend, and an American group, headed by Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering, is to head there this weekend.
"This is a carefully orchestrated process," one European official said, "not a deal exactly, but everyone understands the transaction here. You might call it a political cease-fire leading to the release of hostages."
So far, General Abubakar has managed to hold the junta and the officer corps together, although some analysts in the United States said they feared that many officers were less committed than their leader to national reconciliation.
Presuming that the prisoners are released, General Abubakar's next major task will be to restore not only the army's self-respect but its standing in the country. That will not be easy. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, one of the prisoners already released by the new Government, said recently that the army had become "a liability to the nation," with "no credibility."
The military is one of the few truly national institutions in Nigeria, where the Yoruba in the southwest, the Hausa in the north and the Ibo and others in the southeast have often been at odds. Obafemi Awolowo, one of the country's leaders in the early post-colonial days, once said: "West and East Nigeria are as different as Ireland from Germany, and the north is as different from either as China."
These differences greatly complicate matters. Mr. Abiola is a Yoruba, and the army, as always, is dominated by Hausa officers.

HEADLINE: Who Bears Harassment Burden?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A June 27 editorial rightly praises the Supreme Court decisions holding businesses liable for sexual harassment that occurs in the workplace. But the rulings leave unaffected the abuses inflicted on women in businesses run by American corporations and their contractors abroad. 
 What is the difference between sexually harassing women workers in an auto plant in Normal, Ill., and sexually harassing women making toys in Shenzhen, China? An economist might describe the difference this way: United States labor policies are more rigid compared with China's, giving China a comparative advantage in the global economy.
Most corporations do not have codes of conduct that bar sexual harassment in their foreign operations. And many with a code have no way to enforce it. Rules against sexual harassment must be included in trade agreements.

HEADLINE: Japan Is Still Key To China's Growth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
With Japan in a banking crisis (front page, June 27), United States policy has been to urge Japan to stimulate its economy to strengthen the yen. The incredibly low half-percent interest rate has caused a massive capital flight to strong-currency countries paying much higher rates. This flight is not just from banks but also from real estate and the stock market. 
 Japan has maintained low rates to stimulate exports and earn foreign exchange, but this has only served to depress the stock and real estate markets and weaken bank reserve ratios. Japan should instead raise its bank borrowing rate sharply to bring it closer to rates in the United States and Europe. This would strengthen the yen and the real estate and stock markets.

HEADLINE: Failure to End a Gas Tax May Hurt New York Power Plants

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 2

 BODY:
Just as New York begins forcing electric power plants to compete with one another for business, experts say that plants in the state will be at a disadvantage against competitors in other states because of the State Assembly's failure to act on a little-noticed bill in the final days of the 1998 session.
The bill -- which was supported by business groups, environmentalists and a bipartisan group of lawmakers -- would have repealed a New York tax on out-of-state purchases of natural gas, the fuel used in most of the plants that supply the state's electricity. The bill passed the State Senate but never came to a vote in the Assembly, so the tax will remain in effect at least until next year. 
 The tax is structured so that the owners of New York's power plants usually have not had to pay it. But changes in the industry are about to take away that protection, forcing gas-fired plants in the state to begin paying the tax.
Opponents of the tax say it will give an advantage to power companies in other states that want to break into New York's newly competitive market, and to plants that burn coal, which pollute far more than those that burn gas.
According to legislators, lobbyists and Assembly staff members who tracked the bill, there was no opposition to it and there were no disagreements over wording. They say it seems to have died of neglect.
"This was so frustrating to us," said Carol Murphy, executive director of Independent Power Producers of New York, a lobbying group for nonutility power producers, "because we have a problem that's happening right now that needed to be dealt with, and nobody was against this bill, and yet nothing happened."
After Gov. George E. Pataki's broad budget vetoes in April, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, signaled that he would not allow passage of any bills that might be considered budget-related, but people close to the Speaker said it was not clear if that category included the gas tax bill, or if the measure simply fell through the cracks.
Patricia Lynch, the chief spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, said she was not sure why the bill did not come to a vote.
Each year, the Legislature waits until the final days of the session to take up hundreds of bills. Custom and legislative rules dictate that by then, nearly everything must go through one of a handful of committees that are tightly controlled by the leadership of each house, before reaching the full house for a vote. Lawmakers say it is not humanly possible for them and their staffs, in those frenzied days, to get to each bill, and thus many are allowed to die without a vote.
Since 1991, the state has taxed natural gas purchases from other states at 4.25 percent. The tax generates $18 million a year, little more than a rounding error in the state's $35 billion-a-year general fund.
The tax law exempted the state's giant regional utilities, which own most of the major gas-fired power plants and produce most of the state's electricity.
But New York, like many states, is reshaping the power industry, and one of the first steps will be to force the utilities to sell their power plants. The first round of sales is scheduled for this month. Once those plants are sold, their gas purchases will no longer be exempt from the tax because they will no longer be utility-owned.
Independent power producers -- plant owners that do not directly serve customers, but sell their power to the utilities -- pay the tax. But the law makes the utilities reimburse these producers for the tax and pass the cost on to customers.
The changes under way in the industry mean that the independents will not be selling power exclusively, or even primarily, to the utilities, so they will no longer be reimbursed the cost of the tax. Instead, they will sell directly to customers, or to middlemen, or to the new owners of the plants the utilities are selling off.
Just as the independent power producers begin having to absorb the cost of the gas tax, they will be forced into a new, competitive market, with power producers from around the country trying to undercut one another's prices.
"Ninety-five percent of the cost of operating a plant is the cost of gas, and the margins between competing suppliers are going to be in tenths of a percent, so a 4.25-percent tax is enormously damaging," Ms. Murphy of the power producers' group said.
Environmentalists want the tax repealed so that gas can prevail over coal in the power industry. "Natural gas is much, much cleaner than coal," said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "We're about to put gas at a competitive disadvantage."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Vows to Help an Asia in Crisis

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Friday, July 3

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that "cronyism, corruption and overextended credit," unchecked by competent financial regulation, had led to the economic maelstrom now sweeping Asia and has spread to Hong Kong, plunging it into its deepest recession in decades.
"The crisis has touched nearly all the nations and households of Asia," Mr. Clinton said in an address at the soaring harbor-front Hong Kong convention center. "Restoring economic growth and confidence will not be easy, but the United States will do all we can to help any Asian government work its way back to financial health." 
 In the first comment by an American official on the steps outlined by Japan on Thursday to deal with its banking crisis, Mr. Clinton today endorsed the proposals, which are intended to create an emergency $200 billion fund to protect businesses and depositors in need of bridge loans to weather the financial storm. He called Tokyo's program "potentially quite significant" and said the United States welcomed it as a partial means to ease the impact of the crisis on the region.
Mr. Clinton also praised Beijing, as he has several times on this nine-day trip to China, for what he called the "disciplined and wise policy" of resisting the temptation to devalue its currency, the yuan, to boost exports and hard-currency earnings. Allowing the value of the Chinese currency to fall, Mr. Clinton warned, could lead to "competitive devaluations that could threaten China, the regional economies and the world."
Mr. Clinton spoke to several hundred business leaders in a morning event sponsored by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
When he arrived here Thursday evening, Mr. Clinton pledged that the United States would do its part to lift Asia out of its economic quagmire.
"I want you to know that the United States considers Hong Kong vital to the future," Mr. Clinton said at a banquet where the chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, was the host. "This present financial crisis, too, will pass, if we work together with discipline and vision to lift the fortunes of our neighbors."
Mr. Clinton's visit to Hong Kong, the first by a sitting President, came one day after the former British colony marked the first anniversary of its return to China. And it gives him the opportunity to assess one of the grander experiments in modern political history: China's pledge to let Hong Kong remain a capitalist enclave in the world's last Communist empire.
These days, economics are overshadowing politics here. Hong Kong is suffering badly from the Asian financial contagion.
"Hong Kong is a world symbol of trade, enterprise, freedom and global interdependence," Mr. Clinton said, looking weary despite having relaxed earlier in the day on a two-hour boat trip on the Li River near Guilin, in south China. He used the visit to Guilin to discuss China's dire environmental problems.
Mr. Clinton praised Hong Kong and China for being anchors of stability in a region-wide economic storm -- a reference to the fact that neither Government has devalued its currency, despite the continued weakness of the Japanese yen and a wave of tit-for-tat devaluations across the region.
Mr. Tung, a shipping magnate appointed by Beijing shortly before the hand over, welcomed the President's show of support, saying that "what started as a regional crisis has taken on a global importance."
President Clinton met privately with Mr. Tung for 20 minutes before the banquet, during which they discussed the economy, according to the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry. But he said Mr. Clinton also pressed Mr. Tung to accelerate the introduction of democracy to Hong Kong by allowing voters to elect a larger percentage of legislators directly.
Mr. Tung, who long lived in the West, is not known as a champion of democracy. In his remarks at the banquet, he pointedly reminded Mr. Clinton that Hong Kong was a Chinese city. "The fact is, we are Chinese and were brought up in Chinese tradition and values," he said.
Today, Mr. Clinton sampled the new Hong Kong -- with a hectic series of meetings and appearances that brought him in contact with newly-elected politicians, both friendly and hostile to Beijing.
James Steinberg, the deputy assistant to the President for national security affairs, said the Clinton Administration wanted to demonstrate that the United States "continues to be active and involved and concerned about preserving Hong Kong's autonomy and strengthening democracy there."
But the White House has landed in a minor tempest over a meeting with Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy leader, Martin Lee. Mr. Clinton was scheduled to meet alone with Mr. Lee today, a move likely to displease Beijing. The White House barred press coverage of the meeting, except for a photographer. It said it would issue no public statements afterward, upsetting Mr. Lee and his supporters.
Mr. Steinberg said the restrictions were "normal practice" when Mr. Clinton meets with opposition leaders. Mr. Lee's aides said the White House was seeking to assuage the Chinese, and had originally balked at a one-on-one meeting, even though Mr. Lee has met Mr. Clinton before in the Oval Office.
If true, the White House may have ended up irking both sides. Mr. Lee said he found the decision "very odd, because it seems to me that President Clinton's whole visit to China has been televised. Why does he stop with me?"
After that meeting, Mr. Clinton was scheduled to sit down with a group of Hong Kong leaders, including Mr. Lee and three other popularly-elected legislators. Among them was Tsang Yok-sing, a former high school principal and avowed Marxist who heads the main pro-Beijing party in Hong Kong.
The President also planned to meet with senior civil servants, and the head of Hong Kong's Government-owned broadcasting outlet, Radio Television Hong Kong, Cheung Man-yee. R.T.H.K. has been harshly criticized by pro-Beijing people here for undermining the local government and being disloyal to the mainland.
President Clinton was among the first passengers to land at Hong Kong's new $20 billion airport -- touching down 10 hours after President Jiang Zemin of China dedicated the vast complex -- and became its first departing passenger.
Like some Hong Kong residents, though, Mr. Clinton expressed nostalgia for the old airport, Kai Tak, which was famous for the rooftop-skimming approaches made by planes as they landed. Mr. Clinton, who sat in the cockpit of a plane as it landed at Kai Tak on a visit to Hong Kong more than a decade ago, said, "It was one of the most exciting and uncertain experiences of my lifetime."
Before flying to Hong Kong, Mr. Clinton spoke Thursday on the environmental hazards confronting China. With the spectacular limestone peaks of the southern city of Guilin as a backdrop, Mr. Clinton said that 5 of the world's 10 most polluted cities are in China and virtually every body of water in the country is tainted with human and industrial waste. But, he said, China did not have to sacrifice its environment to continue to build its economy.
He urged China to build more energy-efficient cars, homes and factories. The alternative, he said, was further environmental degradation and ultimately, slower economic growth.
The President, addressing a small, carefully-screened audience at a park in Guilin, one of China's most popular tourist destinations, said that not long ago American cities were choked with smog and many of its urban waterways were seriously polluted.
"China's extraordinary growth has put the same kind of pressure on your environment, and the costs of growth are rising right along with your prosperity," the President said. "You know better than I that polluted air and water are threatening your remarkable progress. Smog has caused entire Chinese cities to disappear from satellite photographs."
He said China can take immediate steps to slow the damage. "We can use clean, as opposed to dirty, energy sources much more than we do; and we can adopt new technologies to make the energy we have go further much more than we do."

Union Protest at Bank

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
About 200 union members and their supporters gathered outside a Manhattan branch of Banco Popular yesterday to protest the institution's role in the purchase of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company.
The protesters were angry that Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico signed a law last month completing the $1.9 billion sale of the telephone company, pending approval from the Federal Communications Commission, to a group led by the GTE Corporation and including Banco Popular, a unit of Popular Inc. 
 Telephone company employees in Puerto Rico have been on strike for two weeks. The workers said the sale would leave 2,700 people jobless and lead to higher telephone rates.
Police herded the protesters, some waving Puerto Rican flags, into a 15-by-60-foot pen made from barricades opposite the bank on West 51st Street, next to the Fashion Cafe in Rockefeller Center.
Employees at the bank gathered in its lobby to watch the protest but would not comment on it.
Bank officials in Puerto Rico, to whom questions regarding the sale were referred, did not immediately return calls for comment.

JAPAN ANNOUNCES A PLAN TO TACKLE MOUNTAIN OF DEBT

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, July 3

 BODY:
The Government announced a long-awaited plan today to clear away the nation's pile of bad debt in hopes of bolstering global confidence in Japan and setting the world's second largest economy on track for growth.
The "Total Plan," which still needs to be approved by Parliament, amounts to a program for dealing with at least $550 billion in problem loans held by Japan's largest banks. The centerpiece is a mechanism to allow banks to fail without provoking chaos in the financial system. 
 The Government would shut down insolvent institutions and turn over their clients to Government-run "bridge banks" to keep the credit flowing. It would also accelerate sales of depressed real estate held as collateral for bad loans. Shaky companies would close, thousands of people could be put out of work, and bankers could be prosecuted for financial misconduct. The Government hopes that the plan could be completed within the next two to five years.
Hikaru Matsunaga, the Finance Minister, announced that the Government was embracing the plan, shortly after it was approved today by a task force. Markets reacted cautiously to the announcement, which had been widely anticipated, while foreign governments urged that it be followed up with strong measures to put it into effect.
There has been growing apprehension that the Japanese banking crisis is now at the heart of Asia's financial problems and may also threaten the economies in the West and the long boom on Wall Street. And President Clinton and other American officials have been stepping up the pressure lately on the Japanese. In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in a statement that the plan contained "potentially significant steps," but he stressed that "what is important is for the Japanese authorities to move quickly to translate this approach into concrete actions."
In Tokyo, analysts warned that because the plan would bring about a great deal of pain, Japan's leaders faced enormous obstacles in carrying it out.
"I think there's a great deal of will to clean the bad debt out of the private sector, and I think the politicians are committed to that, but I'm not sure the politicians are willing to restructure the financial sector and restructure the economy," said John Neuffer, a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo. "They are wonderful when it comes to passing around the pork, but much less willing to pass around the pain."
The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks, which has soared over the last seven days on expectations of the plan and in anticipation of tax cuts, was down 90.81 points, to 16,380.77, at the midday recess today.
The Nikkei finished up 108.69 points Thursday, or sixth-tenths of a percent, at 16,471.58. But currency markets showed hesitancy, weakening the yen to 140.34 to the dollar from 139.17 in early London trading, just as Finance Minister Matsunaga was outlining the plan.
An outline of the plan, which is expected to be approved by Parliament in late July or early August, was disclosed by Mr. Matsunaga and other officials. They insisted that Japan would move toward a market-based economy and pull away from the convoy system in which all the banks support one another and move ahead only as quickly as the slowest bank. Masaharu Hino, head of the new Financial Supervision Agency, suggested that the Government would allow more banks to fail. He said the agency would take "strict measures" after it inspected the nation's 19 largest banks over the next few months.
"We will recover confidence in the Japanese financial system by severing ties with the past convoy administration and shifting to an administration of severe policing, based on clear rules," Mr. Hino said. "That is the main road toward the rebirth of the financial system."
Japan's economy has been languishing ever since the speculative economic bubble burst in the early 1990's, sending property prices crashing and bad loans soaring. For nearly eight years, both the Government and the banks have been sitting tight in the hopes that the real estate market would recover and their problems disappear.
Though the banks have been nibbling away at their bad debts, the problems have worsened with the recession. The Government has let a few banks fail in a controlled, ad hoc fashion, and it has set aside $214 billion to protect depositors and bolster the capital strength of the banks. But it has been loath to take drastic measures to solve the problem -- until now.
Indeed, officials used the English words "Total Plan" to describe the new measure today, perhaps because they sound bolder and more innovative than the equivalent Japanese terms. The effort appears to be modeled on the United States cleanup of the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980's.
The plan tries to tear off bad debt from the banks through foreclosures on properties held as collateral and by encouraging the revival of the real estate market. It also aims to bring about a more open financial system by increasing disclosure in a traditionally secretive banking community and to impose greater rigor in the system by stepping up inspection standards and controls.
Insolvent banks will be allowed to fail, using a two-stage bridge bank. The plan will first put collapsed banks under Government administration, protecting creditworthy borrowers left in the lurch by the failed bank, while a merger partner is sought. Then the collapsed bank will be either acquired or, if no buyers emerge, it will be nationalized with public money, sending the bad debts to an agency established to collect bad loans.
The advantage of the bridge bank approach is that it insures that corporate customers of a failed bank will continue to have access to loans, reducing the shock of a bank failure. The disadvantage is that it raises questions about whether Japan, which has overcapacity in its financial system, is truly willing to let banks fail and whether the bridge bank system is simply one more way of allowing insolvent institutions to founder a bit longer.
Initially, public money will be drawn from the 30 trillion yen, or $214 billion, bailout fund set up in March at the Deposit Insurance Corporation, which will set up the bridge banks as subsidiaries of a new holding company. The corporation will then try to transfer the business to a healthy bank within two years, though that could be extended to five years. The total cost of the bailout is by no means clear.
One sticky point is how the distinction between good and bad borrowers will be made and whether bad borrowers will be rescued along with the good ones. Naturally, any client of a failed bank will insist that it is a good borrower and should continue to receive loans.
Japan is designing a mechanism that appears similar to the former Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States, which disposed of bad debts during the savings-and-loan crisis in the 1980's. In Japan, the Financial Supervisory Agency, which last month split off about 400 people from the Finance Ministry to inspect the banks, will be given wide authority to direct the process.
Critics of the blueprint, however, say the Total Plan does not address some of the fundamental rigidities of the economy.
"It's not a Total Plan at all," said Chiaki Nishiyama, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who is now in Tokyo. "It's a very deceiving term."
Even if the plan purges the banks of their bad loans, many economists feel that a broad restructuring and deregulation of industry are still necessary to bring about a strong economic revival. One difference between the American experience and Japan's situation is that the United States embarked on the painful reworking of the savings-and-loans industry just as the economy was picking up. In contrast, Japan is beginning its plan as it sinks into a recession, and it is already spending $120 billion in fiscal expansion to bolster economic output.
"They might get a mild recovery out of this, but it will not be impressive," said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities Japan. "If there's a promise of a deregulatory effort, they can use fiscal expansion as a down payment. But a fiscal down payment by itself, without restructuring, is a waste."
Some economists, however, are a little bit more hopeful. Resolving the bad debt is the first step toward improving the economy, they say.
"First we have to solve the confidence crisis, and solving the bad loans is a starting point," said Heizo Takenaka, an economics professor at Keio University. Then, he added, we can "promote a deregulated, more transparent open-market system."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 31, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on July 3 about a plan by the Japanese Government to clear away the nation's bad debts referred incorrectly to the timing of the plan. Government officials have not indicated when the plan might be completed; they did not say they hoped it would take two to five years.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rights Shortfall

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Clinton, at Beijing University, Presses Call for Liberty" (front page, June 29): While it is appropriate to castigate China for accepting only those human rights that suit its own interests, President Clinton must recognize that even the United States continues to spurn rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- economic and social rights that insure an adequate standard of living. It is not coincidental that the only industrialized country to reject economic and social rights also boasts the highest disparity between rich and poor and the highest child poverty rates among the industrialized countries. 
 That 30 million Americans are hungry, 5 to 7 million are homeless, 40 million have no health insurance, and 1 in 4 children lives in poverty shows how far the United States falls short of its commitment to human rights.

HEADLINE: Getting Serious About Adultery;
Who Does It and Why They Risk It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL NORMAN; Michael Norman teaches journalism at New York University.

 BODY:
Bertrand Russell, the wide-eyed British logician, simply couldn't understand why people got so worked up about a little bit of dallying, why they seemed unable to "distinguish sexual intercourse from marriage as a procreative partnership" and simply wink at the former and carry on with the latter.
He blamed the "psychology of adultery" for many of the sexual woes of society, the misery, as he put it, that usually follows what the French call liaison intrigue. 
 Views about sex and marriage, of course, are complicated and often contradictory. Americans may be moralistic and conventional (to use Russell's judgment) but they are also tolerant. In the context of a good economy, for instance, polls show that Americans seem to care little about whether their President is chronically concupiscent. And perhaps this ambivalence, in part, explains why tens of millions of American men and women have had extramarital affairs or know well someone who has. Still, there is limited data and only a small amount of research dedicated specifically to infidelity.
"More than any other human behavior, adultery is cloaked in secrecy," said David Buss, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin.
Nevertheless, generations of cultural critics, writers, philosophers, clerics, politicians and so on have been trying to explain adultery, and now social scientists have joined them. So far they have assembled only a relatively small body of specific data, and although that work is often colored by ideology, personal experience and research samples too small to be conclusive, the ideas that are beginning to emerge from these efforts offer a fascinating peek at our roiling emotions, biological appetites and libidinous itches.
The research falls roughly under two disciplines: social demography (who does it) and psychology (why they take the risk).
One of the most reliable statistics on adultery comes from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. In 1992 the center sent hundreds of interviewers to gather data on the sexual conduct of Americans in the National Health and Social Life Survey. In a face-to-face survey of 3,432 adults born from 1933 to 1974, researchers asked: "Have you ever had sex with someone other than your husband or wife while you were married?"
A quarter of the married men in the United States and a sixth of the married women reported having at least one extramarital affair.
Like all statistics, the data invited different interpretations. The sociologists who conducted the study wrote in "Sex in America: A Definitive Survey" that the figures show a "picture of an essentially monogamous America" and that "each individual spends most of his or her life with only one partner." Although marriage and Divorce rates may seem alarming, those in serial relationships tend to be faithful "as long as the marriage is intact."
More striking, perhaps, is this: Almost 90 percent of the men surveyed and 94 percent of the women believed that extramarital sex was "always wrong" or "almost always wrong." In other words, the overwhelming majority of Americans either practiced monogamy or aspired to it.
"People in the United States almost universally think adultery is wrong even while they are doing it," said John Gagnon, a professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and one of the authors of the Chicago study.
But the same data also suggest a different skein. The Chicago ratios applied to today's population mean that some 19 million American men and 12 million American women have entwined at least once outside the marriage bed. "That's a helluva lot of people being unfaithful," said Todd K. Shackelford, an assistant professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University.
What is more, many social scientists think the Chicago percentages are low. "Can we really expect people to be honest about such a critical, life-changing event?" Mr. Shackelford asked. And his clinical colleagues agree. "We have to realize that if someone is going to lie to their husband or wife, they sure as hell are going to lie to a poll taker," said Frank Pittman, a psychiatrist in Atlanta who writes widely on adultery. "You're asking them to expose the worst thing they ever did."
Experts divide even more when they are asked why people commit adultery. In the last two decades, some social scientists have insisted that all human behavior is a product of millennia of adaptation, and increasingly human sexual behavior, including adultery, is being examined through an evolutionary lens.
When Helen Fisher, an anthropologist, began to study adultery in the 1980's, she found that "there exists no culture in which adultery is unknown, no cultural device or code that extinguishes philandering."
Intrigued by the conundrum of human mating behavior -- the preference for monogamy alongside the pervasive fact of "extra-pair copulation" -- Ms. Fisher, a research associate at the Center for Human Evolutionary Studies at Rutgers University, recently wrote a paper in which she contends that the neurochemical circuitry of the brain accounts for a person's sex drive, sexual attractiveness and sense of attachment.
 
Humans Can Love 2 People at Once
"The human animal," she said in an interview, "is built to love more than one person at a time. In other words, we are capable of feeling long-term attachment while we feel attracted to someone at the office or the club or on the street. We have neurocircuitry that can lead us to adultery, and we have neurocircuitry that allows us to say 'no' to adultery."
As Mr. Buss describes this idea, across evolutionary history men and women "have evolved short-term and long-term mating strategies." Each strategy has benefits for the species. Long-term mating, or monogamy, as it might be called, aids "pair-bond maintenance," or in acquiring the basic necessities of life, and child-rearing. The short-term mating strategy is adultery.
In men, Mr. Buss says, this is the evolutionary impulse or need to reproduce, to mate with as many different women as possible to make sure the bloodline, and thus the species, survives. In women, however, the evolutionary urge is harder to explain, given the risks: the loss of a mate-provider and all the resources that go with him. "The big mystery," as he puts it, at least in evolutionary terms, is, "what do women get out of it?"
And here he has developed several theories, among them:
*The resources hypothesis. A lover may supply extra food or better protection than a woman's long-term mate.
*The genetic diversity hypothesis. Here, said Mr. Buss, "a woman can produce genetically variable offspring if she has them with genetically different males." or, In Mr. Buss's words, "it's like hedging your bets in the stock market by diversifying your investments."
*The mate-switching hypothesis. Women "might use affairs if they have a mate who has fallen down, not providing resources or hurting the children."
Mr. Buss's colleague, Mr. Shackelford, says that "when the benefits are much higher than the costs, both men and women are wonderfully good at committing adultery." He quickly added with some heat: "Now, that doesn't make it all right. I'm married and don't want my wife to be adulterous. I don't care if there are evolved mechanisms or not."
 
Therapists Ask Which Comes First
Both Mr. Shackelford and Mr. Buss caution that a lot of their work is theoretical and speculative. And some prominent scholars have questioned the whole premise of evolutionary psychology, dismissing much of the work as hypotheses without a shred of proof. Among those who study human sexuality, particularly clinicians and therapists, the notion that infidelity has somehow evolved as adaptive behavior holds little weight.
Neil Jacobson, a professor of psychotherapy research and director of the Center for Clinical Research at the University of Washington, is designing a major study to answer one of the fundamental questions among clinicians. "We want to know to what extent affairs are being caused by existing marital problems or to what extent the affair caused marital problems that did not exist," he said.
The sociologists who conducted the University of Chicago sex survey feel they have answered this question. Edward O. Laumann, the George Herbert Mead Distinguished Service Professor in the department of sociology, said the data he and his colleagues collected in 1992 clearly showed that people get into adultery when the marriage is troubled.
But Mr. Jacobson is not so sure. "We don't want to let the lore from the culture or the clinical lore lead us into thinking we know the answer," he said. So he wants to know: Did marital trouble lead to the affair or did the affair cause the trouble? Do men and women react differently to the news? What makes an adulterer? (The popular wisdom is that women dally for love or emotional satisfaction, men for sex or pure pleasure.)
In Atlanta, Frank Pittman, a psychiatrist who has written often on the subject in books and magazines, estimates that he has treated some 5,000 couples in the last 38 years. Lately he has noticed "women seem to be having more affairs than they did 20 years ago, 10 years ago," in part because as they travel more for work, they have more opportunities for affairs far from home, he said.
"I've also started to see a few female philanderers," he added, "married women who have causal affairs in what used to be the old male pattern of find 'em, bed them, forget them, the kind of sport men used to brag about."
 
Testing the Effects Of Baby Boomers
Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Washington, is trying to test the notion that the baby boom generation, the cohort that began "the sexual revolution," came into adulthood with different cultural and moral values from their parents'. Using data from other studies and some 300 interviews she plans to conduct, she hopes to chart the details of baby boom love, sex and marriage, including extramarital amourettes.
Whatever she and the others discover, the subject of adultery will probably hold the species' collective curiosity for a very long time. Ever since Homer set Odysseus wandering and surrounded the faithful Penelope with suitors, adultery has been a major theme in Western culture. "It has fascinated people," said Professor Schwartz, "because anyone who lives a hidden life is fascinating. We're shocked and fascinated when we find out what is really going on: that lovely couple down the street is having an affair with that other lovely couple down the street."

Partisan Fires Burned Bitterly On July 4ths Past

BYLINE: By John H. Cushman Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
The hottest holiday argument this weekend may be between partisans of wet or dry barbecue, or over whether a day at the beach is worth half a day spent in traffic.
But there were Independence Days two centuries ago when the consummate celebration of American nationalism deteriorated into bitter disputes between rival political parties, exceeding even the political passions that seized the early republic the other 364 days of the year. 
 In a lecture this week at the National Archives, the historian Len Travers of the Massachusetts Historical Society described how the day became ensconced as a central rite of the emerging republic. And in his book "Celebrating the Fourth" (University of Massachusetts Press, 1977), he recollects an era from the ratification of the Constitution until the War of 1812 when, in some cities, the Fourth of July was strictly partisan.
In those days, a fellow could be beaten for wearing the wrong party's colors on his hat, and Boston routinely threw two separate celebrations, each controlled by one of the two contending political parties of the day.
Divisive partisanship at a celebration of nationhood seems as strange to a modern sensibility as if this year's celebration in Washington were to be divided along party lines: the evening concert on the West Lawn of the Capitol controlled by the Republican majority in Congress, and the afternoon blues concert on the grounds of the Washington Monument controlled by President Clinton and the Democrats.
Two hundred years ago, the Federalists viewed the revolution as beginning with the Declaration of Independence and ending neatly with the Constitution, while the emergent Republicans saw a dynamic, continuing revolution and thrilled to its echoes in France.
Although most American revolutionaries had hoped to avoid a slide into partisanship, the parties often sharply disagreed over economic and international policies. The debate colored relations with England and France as those foreign powers, still entrenched in North America, fought for global dominance.
"In Boston especially, these groups organized competing celebrations, to a large degree transforming the Fourth of July into an occasion for boisterous rallies for the party faithful," Mr. Travers wrote.
Indeed, as the oratory became more confrontational, the Fourth sometimes carried with it an atmosphere of potential violence. By 1794, during the negotiation of the Jay Treaty with Britain, Philadelphia's celebrations verged on mayhem. The treaty settled commercial and other disputes with the British, but was divisive because it favored Federalist mercantile interests and disadvantaged the French in their fight with England. Marching Republican tradesmen who supported France and opposed the accord ultimately retreated rather than fight the fully armed Federalist cavalry that mobilized to meet them.
The war of words, symbols and sometimes fists went on for years. One year a Boston merchant with Federalist sympathies roughed up a French diplomat who wore a tricolor cockade on his hat. The scrap of cloth was a provocative political symbol.
Mr. Travers wrote that the very idea of making the Fourth a holiday took hold partly because the political parties wanted more people at liberty for the contending rallies.
By 1800, the year of Thomas Jefferson's election to the Presidency, the Federalists were in disarray, but they still controlled Boston's city government and the city's official celebrations. By 1802 the Republicans were mounting regular "mustang" or upstart celebrations, and the competition persisted for the next decade.
Federalist oratory reverberated in the Old South Meeting House; the Republicans, not to be outdone, held their events at Faneuil Hall, with its own proud Revolutionary history, complete with Republican militia.
In 1806, after the Republicans trounced the Federalists in statewide elections, Boston's Federalist selectmen took revenge on the victors with the news that Faneuil Hall was "pre-engaged by the Federalists" for Independence Day, the next year and every year after. Driven out of Boston, the Republicans crossed the Charles River and celebrated on Bunker Hill.
Only with the War of 1812 and the peace of 1815 did the political winds shift enough to lessen this partisanship. From then on Independence Day was mainly a patriotic event, Mr. Travers wrote.
Nonetheless, he told his audience at his National Archives lecture to think about what modern Democrats and Republicans, or for that matter, speakers from third parties, might say through the smoke of today's supposedly neutral barbecues.
"The nonpartisan was always the ideal," he said. "However, the subtext was often partisan, and I submit that it often is, even today. Rituals have a purpose."

HEADLINE: Consulting Firm In Acquisition

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 3

 BODY:
Metzler Group Inc., an energy industry consulting firm, has agreed to buy LECG Inc., an economic analysis and consulting group, for $274 million in stock, to expand services to customers.
Under the tax-free agreement, which was disclosed on Wednesday, Metzler will exchange six-tenths of a share of its common stock for each share of LECG, or $21 a share, based on the price of Metzler shares when the deal was announced on Wednesday. 
 Shares of Metzler, based in Chicago, fell $3.125 Thursday, to $31.875, in Nasdaq trading. The stock of LECG, based in Emeryville, Calif., jumped $3.4375 a share, to $18.75.
The deal will allow Metzler to profit from energy industry consolidation by instantly expanding the services it can offer. It also expands Metzler's customer base and sites, adding LECG's 14 offices worldwide.
"There are tremendous synergies that our two firms can exploit, particularly in merger analysis, restructuring, modeling, derivatives and auction design," LECG's president, Thomas M. Jorde, said.
Metzler said it expected to complete the transaction in the third quarter, after receiving regulatory approval.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Talks Of Tax Cuts, But Vaguely

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 3

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto suggested today that Japan might adopt permanent tax cuts in an effort to revive the economy and calm the financial markets.
Such a move, coming one day after Japan announced a plan to cleanse onerous debts from its banking system, would delight many investors. It would also please Washington, which has urged permanent tax cuts and other far-reaching measures to strengthen the Japanese economy and reduce the risk that the recession here will spread around the globe. 
 But Mr. Hashimoto's comment was vague, and on Wednesday, Kanezo Mura oka, chief Cabinet Secretary, temporarily chilled expectations of a tax cut by saying that it would be discussed only after parliamentary elections on July 12. Many foreign officials have also learned to be wary, believing that Mr. Hashimoto sometimes is in a position to promise more economic measures than he can deliver.
"I expect that tax system reform will be implemented on a permanent basis, rather than in the form of a temporary tax cut," Mr. Hashimoto told a news conference in Kumamoto, where he was campaigning for July 12 elections in southwestern Japan. "I believe this will materialize."
Mr. Hashimoto said in April that the Government would carry out a one-time income tax cut of about $15 billion, atop a similar tax cut earlier this year and another one effective in a couple of months. Today, however, Mr. Hashimoto made no mention of the size of the possible new tax cut, or whether the Government would simply turn the current temporary cuts into permanent ones. Some economists are also skeptical that any tax cuts will be permanent, because they say the Government will be forced to raise taxes in the near future.
Nonetheless, Mr. Hashimoto's comments lifted the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock market index, which was down at the opening by 160 points, the morning after the Government disclosed the blueprint to tackle the nation's bad debt problem. The index closed today at 16,511.24, up 39.66 points, or 0.24 percent, from Thursday's close. Other Asian markets finished lower, but the turnaround in Japan helped European stock markets rally. United States markets were closed in observance of Independence Day.
The yen zigzagged, rising to 138.20 yen against the dollar after Mr. Hashimoto's remarks. The yen had weakened to 141.03 at one point.
Japan's stock market has risen for eight straight days, partly in anticipation of a tax cut and hopes that the Government's blueprint, called the Total Plan, will clean up the bad loan mess in much the same way that the United States solved the crisis in the savings and loan industry in the 1980's. Indeed, the plan resembles the mechanism established by the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1987.
A day after Masaharu Hino, the head of the new Financial Supervisory Agency, which inspects the banks, said it would take "strict measures" if the big banks were found to be insolvent, doubts arose today about whether officials and politicians were backtracking. Japanese newspapers expressed concern that the bridge bank system, the centerpiece of the Total Plan, may not apply to large banks at the heart of Japan's financial system. Instead, the plan, which envisions the creation of Government-run banks that would temporarily take over the business of failed banks to help prevent chaos in the system, may be used only in regional areas, for medium or small financial institutions.
Kiichi Miyazawa, a Parliamentary member and former Prime Minister, told the Asahi Shimbun in an interview for Saturday editions: "I don't think the bridge bank scheme will be used for the big banks."
"But if pressure from that scheme leads to a re-organization of the industry, as through mergers, then we can say it was worth introducing the bridge bank system."
Mainichi Shimbun, a major daily newspaper, said in an analysis today that it was not so clear if there would be series of bank failures. It said a bridge bank might only be used in failures at the regional level.
"Even in the United States, bridge banks were never applied to major bank failures," it said. It added that one reason was that it would be extremely hard to find a buyer for a financial institution with assets of several hundred billion dollars in a short period of time.
Indeed, Finance Ministry officials today reaffirmed the Government's policy of "too big to fail," which is essentially an assurance that it will not let large institutions go under. The Government has bad memories of the collapse last November of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, an event that provoked a sudden shortage of money in the banking system and fanned fears of a financial meltdown.
The bridge bank system would work in two stages. The Government would first appoint special administrators to run a failed institution and to support healthy borrowers of the failed bank while it searched for a merger partner. If that did not work, then the collapsed bank's business would be taken over by a bridge bank created with public funds.
Government officials said today that in theory the plan could certainly be applied to any institution, but that in practice it was more likely to be used in failures of regional institutions. Analysts echoed that view.
"The Total Plan may include the largest banks, but the real purpose is the small, secondary regional banks," said Brian J. Waterhouse, financial analyst at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. "The major 19 banks have the largest number of loans, but smaller banks have a graver danger of going under."
One Japanese banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the process of devising the Total Plan and bridge bank system was driven by politicians, who mainly have their regional constituents in mind. The failure of a regional bank has a huge impact on that region's economy, particularly on the ailing companies that borrowed from that bank.
"We're going to see greater instability," James Fiorillo, banking analyst at ING Barings Japan, said of the Total Plan's impact. "It's not a straight and narrow road forward. It's going to be bumpy."
 The Government has been particularly sensitive to the markets recently, in light of the beating last month that certain bank shares, such as those of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, have suffered. And it has criticized foreign financial analysts for publicly singling out names of weak institutions

HEADLINE: Pollution Puts People in Peril On the Border With Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
Every day Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican city across the Rio Grande from El Paso, produces 75 million gallons of raw sewage, much of which flows through irrigation ditches into the river, the prime source of water for nearly every community in both Mexico and the United States between here and the Gulf of Mexico. Ciudad Juarez has no sewage treatment plant.
In Tijuana, Mexico, near San Diego, a sewage treatment system is in the planning stage, but for now the city continues to discharge sewage into the Pacific, periodically requiring American health officials to close beaches in Southern California. 
 The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to provide the border area with billions of dollars to address air and water pollution -- and, in fact, both Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana recently had financing for sewage treatment systems approved by the bank set up under what were known as Nafta's side accords.
But nearly five years after Nafta was ratified, not a single environmental project financed by the bank is in operation. To the more than 10 million people living along the border of the United States and Mexico, the money promised for the region's serious environmental problems is too long and too little in the coming.
"What's happened so far does not at all meet the great promises that were made," said Beatriz Vera, a program officer with the Paso del Norte Health Foundation, which works to improve health conditions in El Paso, Ciudad Juarez and southeastern New Mexico.
No one disputes that environmental conditions along the border are making people sick. On the Texas side, rates of hepatitis, diarrheal diseases and gastroenteritis -- all commonly linked to water and sanitation problems -- are two to six times the state average. And conditions are worse on the Mexican side.
American officials say pollution problems along the border are especially daunting because the solution often lies on the other side, in Mexico. That is true for water pollution in the Rio Grande, stretches of which remain a dumping ground for human and industrial waste, and for air pollution like the gray haze that periodically engulfs the remote Big Bend National Park in Texas, giving it the smoggiest air of any national park in the West.
American officials trace much of the haze to a mammoth complex of coal-fired electricity plants in northern Mexico, about 125 miles upwind of Big Bend, but they have been unable to negotiate an agreement with Mexico to build scrubbers that would cut the plants' emissions.
Mexico remains strapped for money, and many elected officials on the American side are urging that the United States give it much more help to develop solutions that could help people on both sides of the border.
"We look upon the border as an economic and political dividing label," said State Representative Andrew W. Nichols, a Democrat from Tucson, Ariz., who also is director of the rural health office of the University of Arizona College of Medicine. "But disease knows no border. If we worked more collaboratively with the Mexican Government, if we took that broader perspective, we'd be helping our own people. It's not just generosity; it's self-interest."
But spending American money on projects like sewage treatment plants in another country is a sticky diplomatic and political issue.
"It's very hard to convince Congress we need money to deal with problems that seem to be in Mexico," said Doug Farquhar, an expert on environmental health issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
For that reason, Nafta provided for a binational agency, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission in Ciudad Juarez, to certify cleanup projects, and a $450 million commitment from both nations for a bank to finance the work. President Clinton and other proponents of the free-trade pact said the bank, the North American Development Bank, could use its lending authority to leverage up to $8 billion for the projects.
But the devaluation of the peso in 1994 forced many Mexican communities to curtail plans for landfills and sewage treatment plants, even with low-interest loans available. In other cases, Mexican officials have disagreed over what technological steps are needed to fix the problems.
The commission has certified 21 environmental projects costing $473 million, including the sewage treatment plants in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. But the bank has provided only a fraction of the money so far, and no project is operating yet.
Some experts contend that Nafta's environmental side accords were flawed from the start because they did not provide a specific way for Mexican or American cities to identify tax revenue from new commercial activity generated by the pact's removal of trade barriers.
"There's still no system in place by which the growth, especially on the Mexican side, can begin to pay for itself," said Mary E. Kelly, director of the Texas Center for Policy Studies, an environmental research group that has conducted extensive studies of the border's environment.
Not all of the problems originate south of the border. Mexican officials express outrage over Texas's plans for a low-level radioactive waste dump in Sierra Blanca, a town 80 miles east of here near the border, and that anger has hampered negotiations on air pollution in Big Bend and on other cross-border problems.
Part of the border's environmental problem is simply the population growth on both sides. It is most striking in Mexico; Ciudad Juarez, for example, which had 250,000 people in 1960, now has five times that number. The overall border population has more than doubled, to more than 10 million, and is expected to double again in the next 10 years.
Even as they express frustration over the belated progress, some experts here see signs of hope in the fact that the development bank is approving loans, like the $31.2 million for the first two waste-water treatment plants in Ciudad Juarez's history.
"It's slow, but this is much more than a technical problem," said Jim VanDerslice, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health at El Paso. "It's politics, it's people, it's organizations. When you're working binationally, it's just difficult."
Officials in charge of cleanup plans say they are working as fast as they can. "A lot of people would say it's slower than expected," said Angeles Villarreal, a spokeswoman for the cooperation commission. "But once you are working on these problems, you realize that it takes awhile. These are complicated issues."

Paper Makers Pursuing a Venture in Korea

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 3

 BODY:
Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. of Canada and Norske Skogindustrier A.S. of Norway, two big paper makers, said today that they were in talks with the Hansol Paper Company, South Korea's largest paper maker, to form a joint venture.
Abitibi, based in Montreal, is the world's largest exporter of newsprint. An investment in Hansol could leave more than 65 percent of South Korea's paper industry in foreign hands. 
 Norske earlier agreed to buy the Shinho Paper Manufacturing Company's plant for $174 million, while Bowater Inc. of the United States agreed to buy a newsprint mill owned by the Halla Pulp and Paper Company for $175 million.
Abitibi, Norske and other foreign companies are betting that demand from regional newspapers will increase once Asia's economic problems recede. Other non-Asian newsprint makers are also vying to capture more market share in the region.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OUTLOOK;
Among Hosts, Much Elation

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 3

 BODY:
The Chinese, from the top leaders to the man in the street, were elated with the nine-day visit by an American President who struck many here as vibrant and empathetic.
No matter that President Clinton lectured China, gently but firmly, about the merits of freedom, called the bloody 1989 crackdown on demonstrators wrong and praised the Dalai Lama, who is usually portrayed here as a villain. He seemed to come as a respectful friend. 
 President Jiang Zemin's startling, self-confident decision to allow Mr. Clinton to speak on live television only added to the sense of excitement. "In the view of most people here this signals a new acceptance of China after 1989," said Zhang Xiaojin, an international relations expert at the People's University.
The White House, facing mounting complaints at home that it is coddling the Chinese at the expense of American values and interests, and the Chinese, who want American trade, investment, technology and respect, had congruent interests in this state visit. That was to improve China's image in the United States, showing its diversity and social changes and growing freedoms in the personal realm.
In that, the visit appears to have been a success. And it was President Jiang's insight to recognize that a major concession, like the televising of the Jiang-Clinton news conference and Mr. Clinton's Beijing University speech, was needed to make it so.
"This prevented Clinton from coming back with egg on his face," said Roderick MacFarquhar, a China expert at Harvard University.
The visit has certainly bolstered the status here of President Jiang. Equally important, it gives a boost to the many other pragmatic officials, from Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on down, who believe that the success of their transition to an advanced, market-oriented economy depends on better ties with the undisputed economic and political superpower, the United States.
Despite the paucity of diplomatic breakthroughs at the summit meeting, the friendly, tactful demeanor of President Clinton and Mr. Jiang's bold decision to temporarily loosen the usual tight controls on political discourse helped create a happy feeling about Chinese-American relations.
But elation is hard to follow up on, and the Chinese could be in for morning-after dismay when the unresolved differences rear up again.
These include America's huge and growing trade deficit with China and its refusal to consider Chinese admission to the World Trade Organization until painful changes are made to open markets. American concerns over political and religious freedoms may have been muffled this week, but China is not about to become a liberal democracy, and concerns about weapons proliferation have not yet been fully satisfied.
Because of its own economic cycle, its efforts to revamp the vast state-run economic sector and the Asian financial crisis, China may be in for a rough economic period in any case. Seeing no rush of American trade and investment and high technology, some of this week's cheering citizens here may become disillusioned.
Still, the old-guard Communist hard-liners in the Government who might lead an anti-American reaction seem to have been routed from real influence over the last year by Mr. Jiang and the pragmatists.
Chinese officials and experts, sounding quite like American officials on the subject, say they hope that the good will and low-profile technical ties forged by the reciprocal state visits will help the two countries live through their differences.
"The problems are still here," said Xiong Zhiyong, dean of the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing. "But I think both sides now understand each other better."
The hope, in Beijing as well as in the White House, is that an overarching sense of partnership will enable these two giants to avoid dangerous conflict -- a military confrontation over Taiwan being the worst case -- and to reap mutual economic benefits. American officials, rightly or wrongly, also believe that by engaging China they will nudge it to become more open and democratic.
Chinese people, like Americans, are pondering the meaning of President Jiang's decision to allow the televising of an extended discussion of Tibet, human rights and the 1989 killings in and around Tiananmen Square. It was done in the most tentative of ways: there was no announcement before hand, insuring a small Saturday-noon audience, and Mr. Clinton's most direct words on 1989 and the Dalai Lama and democracy were not reported in the official news media.
It is unclear how this limited but genuine public airing will play out -- whether the Government will feel emboldened to allow more free debate at home, whether people's expectations of free speech will change.
But there is no doubt about the short-term gains, for China as well as for Mr. Clinton.
"The cost to China was relatively small compared to the benefits," said Yasheng Huang, a Chinese-born political economist at the Harvard Business School. "The American public and media were happy with the trip."
Mr. Clinton kept the costs for China down, and avoided a more defensive reaction, by holding back on some sensitive topics, said Mr. MacFarquhar of Harvard. For example, he might have spoken about Taiwan's heady democracy, or pointed to the student-led downfall of President Suharto in Indonesia as a grim example to the Chinese leaders, who brook no opposition themselves.
In his final remarks in Hong Kong, Mr. Clinton seemed to credit China's leaders with a stronger commitment to radical political change than they have ever revealed to their countrymen. He said Mr. Jiang and Prime Minister Zhu were "the right leadership at the right time" and are "clearly committed to reform."
Whether that is an accurate assessment of these longtime Communists whose reforms, so far, seem more designed to save the party's rule than to destroy it remains to be seen. At a minimum, Mr. Clinton's American-style politicking may change a new generation's expectations of its leaders.
"President Clinton was widely admired for his directness, quick wit and frankness," said Mr. Zhang, the People's University professor. "Most importantly, he stood out here in his youth."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON OPTIMISTIC ON CHINA'S FUTURE AS HE HEADS HOME

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 3

 BODY:
President Clinton today called Jiang Zemin, the President of China, a visionary leader who could be the figure who leads China to democracy.
Mr. Clinton, in a news conference that closed his nine-day trip to China, gave a vigorous personal endorsement of the Chinese President, saying Mr. Jiang has the imagination needed to transform China from a single-party Communist state to a pluralistic democracy. 
 The President also praised Premier Zhu Rongji, the architect of China's current economic policies, saying, "There's a very good chance that China has the right leadership at the right time."
Mr. Clinton has sounded increasingly hopeful about China's future as his trip progressed, offering his most optimistic assessment of the nation's political prospects just before departing to return to Washington to celebrate Independence Day.
But his words could come back to haunt him should repression in China harden, leaving Mr. Clinton open to the charges that he was taken in by a seemingly open Mr. Jiang.
Asked whether there will ever be democracy in China, Mr. Clinton said, "Oh, yes, I believe there can be, and I believe there will be.
"And what I would like to see is the present Government -- headed by this President and this Premier, who are clearly committed to reform -- ride the wave of change and take China fully into the 21st century and basically dismantle the resistance to it," he added. "I believe they are."
The President answered questions for 43 minutes, most of them on his trip to China but others touching on the troubled Japanese economy, the prospect of violence in Ireland this weekend and the continuing ethnic bloodshed in Kosovo.
Mr. Clinton offered an overwhelmingly positive summation of his five-city journey through China.
He said that profound differences remain between China and the United States on questions of individual liberty, and he warned that powerful forces still oppose change here.
But he defended his engagement with the Chinese leadership as the course most likely to yield progress on a range of issues from human rights to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The coming months and years will tell whether these few days in early summer were the beginning of a positive new epoch in relations between the United States and China, or merely a sideways step in an ambiguous relationship. There are groups in both countries with a political investment in confrontation rather than cooperation.
Whatever Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang say or do as their nations' leaders, they are but one part of a complex interplay between two diverse and dynamic societies, one that will be shaped as much by transnational corporations, the media, religious groups and even the Internet.
Mr. Clinton tried to reflect that diversity in his appearances here, meeting with villagers, middle-class homeowners, young entrepreneurs, scholars and students.
Absent from the President's schedule was any session with outspoken opponents of the Government. Mr. Clinton defended that decision today, saying he sought to deal with human rights concerns in China "in a way most likely to yield progress."
"I did my best to meet with people who represented all elements of Chinese society," Mr. Clinton said. "The decisions I made on this trip -- and, I remind you, the first trip by an American President in a decade -- about with whom to meet and how to handle it were basically designed, were based on my best judgment about what would be most effective in expanding human rights."
White House officials have said that Mr. Clinton did not want to risk retaliation against those who met with him and that he believed that pressing Mr. Jiang to release groups of political prisoners would be more effective than a theatrical encounter with dissidents.
Mr. Clinton, looking weary from a grueling schedule, said in his opening remarks that his trip to China -- the longest of his Presidency to a single country -- had shown him "the glory of China's past in Xian, the vibrancy of its present in Beijing and the promise of its future in Shanghai and Hong Kong."
"I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to appreciate the remarkable transformation that is under way in China, as well as the distance still to be traveled," the President said in the news conference, held in the ballroom of the Grand Hyatt hotel here.
He clearly was struck by Hong Kong's wealth and vitality, and said the region -- which reverted to Chinese control just a year ago -- could be the model for China's development.
He gave his most extensive assessment of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Zhu, praising them in elaborate language.
The President said of Mr. Jiang: "After I met with him for the first time, I felt very strongly that his chances of becoming the leader of China for a sustained period were quite good because he's a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot of vigor for his age, or indeed for any age. And I think he has a quality that is profoundly important at this moment in history when there's so much change going on. He has a good imagination. He has vision. He can visualize. He can imagine a future that is different from the present."
At the same time, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that Mr. Jiang has constituencies who oppose him and who distrust American motives in engaging China.
To them, Mr. Clinton said: "I hope more of them understand that America wishes China well, that we are not bent on containing China, and that our human rights policy is not an excuse for some larger strategic motive. It's what we really believe. We believe it's morally right, and we believe it's best for them as a practical matter over the long run."
In response to another question, he noted that "democracy is a universal aspiration," an answer to Mr. Jiang's assertion that China's history and culture have led it to different definitions of human rights from those accepted in the West.
The President welcomed the recent release of several well-known dissidents, but said that he now looked to Beijing to release whole classes of prisoners. He particularly cited the 150 people still held on charges related to the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations that were brutally put down by the Government in June 1989. He also called on Beijing to release an unknown number of prisoners held for political activities that the Government has declared to be no longer criminal.
He said that in his talks with Mr. Jiang he had raised charges that China imposes abortion on women to enforce China's one-child policy. "They all say the same thing," Mr. Clinton said. "They say that that is not Chinese policy and it violates Chinese policy." Mr. Clinton added that his view was that "there may be insufficient monitoring of what is being done beyond the capital."
Mr. Clinton offended many in Taiwan this week when he repeated Beijing's preferred formulation of American policy toward Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province. But he defended his decision, saying that he had not changed the substance of American policy, which is to oppose Taiwanese independence and support peaceful reunification with China.
"I believe I did the right thing," Mr. Clinton said.
In response to a question from a reporter from The Irish Times, Mr. Clinton deplored the recent burnings of churches in Ireland and called for high-level talks among Roman Catholic, Protestant and British authorities in advance of annual sectarian marches set for this weekend that in the past have led to violence.
Mr. Clinton offered tempered praise for a package of banking and financial reforms announced by Tokyo in recent days. He said that Japan's economy had substantial underlying strength and expressed hope that the recession there would bottom out soon and growth would resume "in a reasonable amount of time."
On Kosovo, the President offered nothing beyond a hope that Belgrade would show restraint. "There is some uncertainty about who is willing and who is not willing to even negotiate about it," Mr. Clinton said. "And we're working on it as best we can."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA: IN HONG KONG;
'Manhattan Of Asia' Indifferent To Clinton

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 3

 BODY:
They call this city the Manhattan of Asia. And today, as President Clinton wound up his visit to China by motoring around town to give a speech, attend some meetings and do a bit of shopping, Hong Kong treated the leader of the free world with New York-style indifference.
"I'm not paying any attention to him," Chu Shu-san, a 48-year-old newsstand vendor, said with a shrug as he sold copies of papers with Mr. Clinton's picture on the front page. "He's just in transit anyway." 
 To be fair, Mr. Clinton attracted a good crowd for a speech this morning about the relationship between the United States and Asia. But the audience of local and foreign business leaders responded tepidly to his call for a speedier introduction of democracy to this former British colony, which reverted to Chinese rule a year ago.
"We debated this issue for five years in the 1980's," said Vincent Lo, a leading property developer, in a somewhat grumpy tone, as he rose to leave after Mr. Clinton's half-hour speech. "We know the good points and the bad points of democracy, and we know we musn't rush into it."
Mr. Clinton, the first President to visit Hong Kong while in office, came here three times before entering the White House, and he clearly likes the place. "I think it's quite appropriate for our trip to end in Hong Kong, because, for us Americans, Hong Kong is China's window on the world," he said.
Still, the 24-hour stop lacked the high drama of his televised debate with President Jiang Zemin, his freewheeling give-and-take with students at Beijing University or even the solemn welcoming ceremony at Tiananmen Square.
On a rainy day here, few people lined the streets to see Mr. Clinton's motorcade. When Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, slipped away to do some shopping at Shanghai Tang, a boutique that specializes in updated Mao-style clothing, they barely drew a crowd.
Even "Primary Colors," the film adaptation of the thinly disguised satire on the Clinton Presidency, has flopped here. The movie, which opened in Hong Kong the day after Mr. Clinton arrived in China, has earned just a fraction of the box-office of the most popular current film, "True Mob Story."
One reason for the lack of drama is that Hong Kong's troubles are more economic than political. People here are worried about the swooning stock market, the plummeting value of real estate and the stability of the Hong Kong dollar -- topics that do not lend themselves to soaring rhetoric or street theater.
Mr. Clinton praised Hong Kong and China for not devaluing their currencies and he endorsed a $200 billion plan announced on Thursday by the Japanese Government to take over failing banks and protect depositors.
Of course the President did not ignore political issues. He applauded the record voter turnout in Hong Kong's legislative elections of two months ago, saying, "The results were a mandate for more democracy, not less, and faster, not slower, strides toward political freedom."
After his speech, Mr. Clinton met privately for 20 minutes with Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most prominent democratic politician. Mr. Lee, who lost his seat in the legislature when Beijing dissolved the body before the handover and regained it in the recent elections, told the President he hoped that half of the council's 60 seats would be directly elected in 2000 -- compared with 20 seats today.
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said Mr. Clinton listened attentively to Mr. Lee but did not express an opinion on any specific proposals for speeding up democracy in Hong Kong. "I don't think it's for us to get into the specifics of what the timetable of that might be," Mr. Berger said.
Despite Mr. Clinton's reluctance to talk numbers, Mr. Lee said the meeting was "terrific." He said the President responded positively to his argument that the "Hong Kong Government should be encouraged to develop democracy, so they can see that it works well under Chinese rule."
Later Mr. Clinton met several other democratically elected legislators. One participant, Tsang Yok-sing, the head of Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing party, said the President "showed that he has a positive attitude toward developing a constructive relationship with the Chinese leadership."
After his news conference, Mr. Clinton and his family stopped off for some last-minute shopping on their way to Hong Kong's new $20 billion airport. The President's use of the airport is about the only part of his visit that has generated local interest. Air Force One landed six hours after the departure of President Jiang, who had been in Hong Kong to mark the first anniversary of the handover.
The Hong Kong Standard devoted much of its article on Mr. Clinton today to a discussion of the dual presidential flights.

HEADLINE: Rewards of a China Summit

 BODY:
President Clinton's visit to China, like most Presidential journeys abroad, was carefully choreographed to further the interests of host and guest. Both sides hoped to move relations past the lingering trauma of the Tiananmen Square massacre nine years ago, and largely succeeded. The trip also burnished the leadership credentials of President Jiang Zemin, let Mr. Clinton talk about human rights directly to the Chinese people and advanced the easing of tensions between Washington and Beijing. But the hardest issues between the two countries were not resolved, and there was a fair amount of show in place of substance.
Mr. Jiang has become more assertive and liberal over the past 16 months as he emerged from the shadow of Deng Xiaoping. He used his appearances with Mr. Clinton to present himself as a statesman who could meet on equal terms with the leader of the world's richest and most powerful country. More surprisingly, through his own statements and by allowing several of Mr. Clinton's appearances to be shown live and uncensored on Chinese television, Mr. Jiang signaled that he was willing to tolerate more open public debate than China has seen since the period just before the Tiananmen Square crackdown. 
 Mr. Clinton also embraced the opportunity for ceremonial statesmanship, a welcome relief for him from troubles at home. More substantively, he wanted to use this trip to show American audiences that today's China is too complex to be understood simply in terms of army tanks rolling through Tiananmen Square in 1989. By doing so, Mr. Clinton hoped to strengthen domestic support for building closer economic and military links with a country many Americans understandably see as a repressive dictatorship and a potential strategic rival.
Mr. Clinton's repeated declarations to Chinese audiences about the importance of human rights and individual freedom, while less sharp than they might have been, have won him some political latitude on these issues at home. But legitimate misgivings remain about the wisdom of American commercial dealings with companies controlled by the Chinese military and Beijing's alleged attempts to buy influence in American politics.
The nine-day Clinton visit marked a modest gain for relations between the United States and China, which were dangerously frayed as recently as two years ago. Increasingly frequent meetings between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang are improving communication and trust between the two leaders. Last week's agreements on issues like retargeting nuclear missiles, working together to resolve the Asian financial crisis and restraining missile sales to Pakistan were largely symbolic, but at least sent the right signals.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang failed, however, to resolve some of the most serious problems between the two countries. These include the illicit transfer of American space technology to China, Beijing's reluctance to lower trade barriers to qualify for the World Trade Organization and the continued refusal of China to renounce force in its dealings with Taiwan. Having posed for their flattering photo ops and reaped their intended political rewards, both men are now obliged to grapple with these difficult but important problems.

HEADLINE: Obstructing Local Welfare Reform

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made the right moves when he required New York City welfare recipients to work for benefits and asked new applicants to exhaust the search for employment before asking for aid. But as he makes it tougher to obtain welfare, he needs to make sure that the city also has policies and programs that offer tools to move into the work force. Among the big inconsistencies are proposals to limit remedial work at the City University of New York, tighten admission standards and delay student workfare. All are at odds with the aim of preparing more people to be wage-earners.
The city's welfare rolls shrank from 1.16 million in 1995 to about 770,000 this year, partly because of the strong economy and partly because the city tightened screening and required able-bodied recipients to work in exchange for benefits. The rolls will shrink yet again when the city adopts a new system that requires people to search widely for work before receiving public aid. The new system has dramatically driven down applications in places where it has been tested. 
 While steering people toward the job market, however, the Giuliani administration has embraced policies at the City University that make the transition less likely. Over the last two years, for example, the city has steadfastly resisted a program to provide workfare on campus, so that welfare recipients might fulfill their work obligations without disrupting progress toward a college degree. The city will finally begin phasing in a campus workfare plan next fall, more than a year after the State Legislature ordered it to proceed.
Since 1995, the number of welfare recipients attending the City University has dropped from 27,000 to about 12,000, partly because of tuition increases and aid cuts, but also because the initial workfare policy drove them out. The new plan to limit remedial education at CUNY will hit these students even harder, making it less likely that they will acquire the skills they need to earn college degrees. Without degrees, they will be locked out of all but menial jobs.
Welfare reform can succeed only if New York's poorest citizens can get the skills they need to move into the mainstream economy. For that to happen, the city needs to make sure that the people who are being moved briskly toward the work force also have the broadest possible access to training and education.

So the Israeli Government announces plans to extend the authority of the Jerusalem municipality over the hills and towns, primarily to the west and southwest of the Israeli capital. It says this is to improve city planning and services. The U.S. denounces this as a provocation that could derail peace talks. The Palestinians howl in protest. The U.N. moves to censure Israel. But behind the scenes, everyone is still asking: What is this Israeli move really about? Annexation? Provocation? Better bus service?
The answer may be none of the above. According to the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel -- which knows every hill, forest and stone in the areas to be brought under this greater Jerusalem umbrella -- what this is most about is real estate development. We're talking Donald Trump, not Trumpeldor (a famous early Israeli pioneer). 
 For the past decade the Nature Society has been fighting successfully to limit development in the terraced hills and Jewish National Fund forests to the west and southwest of Jerusalem, explains Yoav Sagi, its chairman, who, along with Israel Kimhi, a former Jerusalem city planner, and Avram Shaked, the organization's conservation coordinator, gave me a tour of this area where Jerusalem is to be expanded.
"Right now much of this land is controlled by the state and it is designated as forest and parks, with some open spaces reserved for farming," says Mr. Sagi. "In accordance with the national plan, you can't build on these lands, except with great limitations. We have managed to freeze many real estate projects in these areas, to protect the Judean Hills, the parks and nature reserves.
"This move now to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem appears to us as an effort to get around these restrictions," adds Mr. Sagi. "It seems that the real estate powers are hoping that if the authority for development of these open spaces is shifted from the national planning administration to Jerusalem municipal control, it will be easier to get the restrictions on building lifted -- because of the high cost of housing within Jerusalem's current boundaries, the influence of developers on city planning, and because of the political incentive to build Jewish Jerusalem. And once you get your hands on green areas like this, and turn them into real estate, you are talking about big money."
Real estate money has been known to find its way into political campaigns in Israel, noted Mr. Sagi, and some people are not above using nationalism to mask their real interests.
The Nature Society is fighting this urban sprawl everywhere. If you planted a tree in the hills between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, visit it soon. It may not be there much longer, because by 2020 the area from Haifa to Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is likely to become "one big urban megalopolis," said Mr. Kimhi. "We build here like we are living in Australia -- more is better, bigger is better," adds Mr. Sagi, "but we're not Australia."
It's hard to stop, though. If current population trends continue, Israel, outside the Negev Desert, will soon be one of the most densely populated countries in the world. This population explosion, coupled with the poor use of land inside Tel Aviv and Jerusalem -- which results in these cities'building outward instead of upward -- is increasingly devouring the biblical landscape. The golden arches of McDonald's now dominate a prominent hill as you enter Jerusalem. If there were no Arab-Israeli conflict, the next big Israeli political party would surely be called "Green Now."
Israel can never limit Jewish immigration. But unless it gets much more sensitive about sustainable development, something essential to Zionism is going to be lost.
"Every project that is approved against the national plan, and destroys open space, destroys part of Jewish heritage -- the biblical landscape of David and Solomon's day," said Mr. Shaked. "The Bible refers to the vineyards of Ben Shemen. Today Ben Shemen is the biggest highway interchange in the country. We still speak about 'The Land of Israel' in metaphysical terms, but we forget about the actual land."
Adds Mr. Sagi: "We have to change the culture here from conquering the land to preserving the land. Because if Israel should one day become a normal country, with no more wars, what will sustain us here is the quality of life and connection to the land. But if we keep to this trend, we will have no quality of life and no land to be connected to."

Clinton Completes Trip, Praising Jiang as Visionary
President Clinton called Jiang Zemin, the President of China, a visionary leader who could be the person to lead China to democracy. Mr. Clinton spoke at a news conference at the end of his nine-day trip to China. A1 

Before leaving for home, President Clinton stopped in Hong Kong, taking the opportunity to drive around town to give a speech, attend some meetings and do a bit of shopping. A4
 
Diplomatic Push on Kosovo
American and French officials vowed to keep pushing for a diplomatic solution to head off a wider war in Kosovo, but they agreed that chances for success in the violence-torn Serbian province were uncertain. Richard C. Holbrooke, above, a special envoy to the Balkans, arrived in Serbia for another round of talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and the political leader of the Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova. A6
 
Serbian forces captured the strategic town of Kijevo after a two-week siege. A6
 
Iran Marks Grim Anniversary
Iranian authorities marked the 10-year anniversary of the shooting down of an Iran Air civilian airliner by an American naval cruiser. Teheran brought relatives of the victims as well as journalists to the port of Bandar Abbas in a chartered Iran Air Boeing 707 and ferried them to the point where the plane hit the water. A6
 
The C.I.A. Sees a Weak Link
A classified Central Intelligence Agency report has zeroed in on early warning systems, starting with an obscure post in charge of contrarian thinking, in an effort by the agency to prevent future intelligence miscalculations. The report comes in the wake of the recent United States intelligence blunder in failing to predict the likelihood of India's testing of nuclear weapons. A3
 
Role Reversal for Mexico's PRI
The governor's election in Chihuahua, Mexico, tomorrow is charged with symbolism. Leaders of the PRI, the party that has dominated Mexico for most of seven decades, are running as the opposition. A3
 
Caribbean Legal Changes
Four Caribbean countries have agreed to form their own high court, abandoning a colonial system that made Britain their final legal arbiter. Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad -- all independent nations with varying links to Britain -- hope to establish the Caribbean Court of Justice next year, freeing themselves to reinstate capital punishment. (AP)
 
Toronto Police Found Negligent
A Canadian judge ruled that Toronto's police were negligent for failing to warn women about a serial rapist. The judge, Jean MacFarland, awarded $150,000 to one rape victim. Even after several rapes in the woman's neighborhood, the judge said, officers refused to put up posters about the attacks, fearing that that would ruin their plan to catch the rapist in a stakeout.

Florida Evacuates County Threatened by Fires
The entire population of Flagler County in Florida was ordered evacuated as four brush fires threatened to merge and trap the county's 35,000 residents. A few hours later, 10,000 residents were ordered out of their homes in Brevard County. The evacuations raised the number of people ordered out of their homes this week in northeast Florida to more than 100,000. No deaths have been reported. State officials said that about 124,000 of the 453,000 acres ravaged by the fires since May were burned in the previous 24 hours alone. A1
 
The source of the wildfires can be traced to the weather last winter. A8
 
Improving Food Safety
President Clinton plans to press Congress today to provide all $101 million he has sought to insure the safety of the nation's food supply, according to an advance text of his weekly radio address. Administration officials said that Mr. Clinton also planned to announce two steps that the Administration could take without Congressional authority: a requirement for warning labels on all packaged juice that has not been pasteurized or processed to kill harmful bacteria, and the creation of a national institute for food safety research to coordinate research. A1
 
Ex-CNN Producer Stands Firm
The dismissed producer at the center of the controversy over CNN's report on nerve gas in the Vietnam War defended her work, faulted her superiors and said that "strong interests" had "wanted to discredit this report," which CNN retracted. A8
 
Teacher Union Weighs Merger
The 10,000 delegates to the National Education Association gathering in New Orleans are to vote tomorrow on whether to merge with their union's archrival, the American Federation of Teachers. A combined union would create a colossus with almost 3.3 million members, giving teachers more clout in Washington and a single voice in opposing efforts to approve vouchers and end tenure. The merger is favored by the N.E.A.'s president, Bob Chase, but its approval is in doubt. A7
 
Nafta Projects Lagging
The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to provide the United States-Mexico border area with billions of dollars to address air and water pollution, but nearly five years after Nafta was ratified, not a single environmental project financed by a bank set up under the agreement's auspices is in operation. And no one disputes that environmental conditions along the border are making people sick. A7
 
Ban on Assisted Suicide
The Michigan Legislature approved a bill on Thursday that bans assisted suicide beginning Sept. 1, and Gov. John Engler said he would sign it into law, largely to try to block the activities of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, above, who has acknowledged attending more than 100 suicides. Under the legislation, assisting a suicide would be a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. (AP)

HEADLINE: Ask the Jobless If Marx Is Relevant

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Marx's Stock Resurges on a 150-Year Tip" (Arts pages, June 27) claims Marx probably "would not wish to be remembered today for having predicted capitalism's success," and asserts that much of what he called for did not happen. But Marx remains relevant because he was correct in his assessment of history, in terms of capitalism's success and its inherent difficulties. 
 Will the bourgeoisie "become their own gravediggers"? We will have to wait and see. But you cite the "recent layoff of 15,000 workers at Motorola to meet mounting competition, the 18 million unemployed in Europe, the growing disparity in income throughout the world and workers' increasing insecurity."
What does that suggest if not the creation of "an increasingly pauperized proletariat"?

HEADLINE: Lack of Lifeguards Limits Choice, but a Beach Is Still a Beach

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
The lifeguard shortage that has vexed New York City this year, causing vast stretches of beaches to be closed, seemed little burden to holiday bathers yesterday basking under a sky of perfect robin's-egg blue, with just enough of a breeze to keep a kite up but not so much that it ruffled the pages of a newspaper.
Where a beach was closed with a "No Lifeguard on Duty -- Swimming Prohibited" sign posted, people walked, without a fuss, a few hundred yards to the nearest section where orange-suited lifeguards patrolled the waters. 
 But to a triad of teen-agers who had set out for a day on the beaches of the Rockaways in Queens, the closing of Beach 74th Street, because of a shortage of people who had passed the city's lifeguard test, was an affront.
Of all the indignities that could befall a group of teen-agers on a quest to be cool and aloof -- they were stuck going to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich of a beach, the kind of beach filled with little children and their pails and umbrellas and those incessant parental cries of "Put on more sunscreen" and "Don't go out too far" that they thought they had outgrown.
"Seventy four is supposed to be where everyone hangs out," said Jose Santiago, 19, from East New York, on a day off from his studies to be a computer technician. "It's famous. You go to 74, and you know you're going to bump into somebody you know. Now we got to go there with all those kids and the pails."
With that special sort of disdain teen-agers reserve for anything that reminds them that they are not quite adults, Charlie Collazo, 15, a sophomore at Bushwick High School in Brooklyn, complained, "We got to be with the families."
Kiki Ramos, 16, a student at John Adams High School in South Ozone Park, Queens, looked longingly at the swath of sand roped off with red plastic flags, then motioned to his friends to get over it and move on. "It's still the beach, man," he said.
Parks Department officials said yesterday that the lifeguard shortage was slowly easing. Through recruiting efforts and with high school students who had passed the test finishing their classes, making them free for midweek shifts, the city was able to open more beaches. Alas, not Beach 74th Street.
Michael Colasante recalled that when he was younger, all of his friends went to Beach 116th Street in Rockaway Park. "We'd hang out, listen to rock 'n' roll, drink beer," he said.
Now he's 32, an electrician in Local 3, married, and the father of 3-year-old little Mike. And so, he's on Beach 119th Street. "It's calmer," he said, swinging his delighted son in the surf. "I'm older."
Sharlene Rodriguz said she had gone out to Orchard Beach in the Bronx looking forward to the solitude of section one, at the very tip of the beach, which is radio-free and this year, unfortunately, a swimming-free zone as well.
"I wish it was open -- it's really quiet out there," said Ms. Rodriguz, a 34-year-old chef from the Bronx. She had to settle for section two, a few feet from the orange streamers that marked the closed area, but still, she had to admit, pretty quiet.
Being a lifeguard used to be the ultimate summer job, said Peter Cholakis, a handyman at Beach Channel High School in Far Rockaway, who was swimming with his children, Nicholas, 9, and Elizabeth, 4.
"It was the greatest job," said Mr. Cholakis, who is back at the same beach, 119, that he went to with his parents. "Now, not even the kids who grow up around here go out for it anymore. Now more kids are going to college and they want internships in their fields. The economy's good and there are, you know, classier jobs for them. They don't want to be lifeguards."
But Jason Carey, a 20-year-old student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice sharing duty at Beach 26th Street, said being a lifeguard was still the best summer job he could think of -- and this is his fifth summer doing it. "You can't beat this," he said, his nose already burned a light shade of tomato soup. "I'm getting paid to sit in the sun, at this point about $11 an hour. I'm 20. I live at home. I don't need much else."
A few of Marvin Mullings's friends wanted to be lifeguards; they just could not pass the test. "They're out of shape," said Mr. Mullings, 17, a third-year lifeguard who just graduated from Far Rockaway High School.
As if trying to minimize any bad publicity to the city that the beach closings had caused, none of the city parks workers in the Rockaways, Coney Island or Orchard Beach would give their names or answer anything more than basic questions.
"You can walk or jog along the surf and you can hang out up to the flags," said one parks enforcement officer in the Rockaways who declined to give her name. "But after the flags, you can't swim or lounge."
A few sea gulls disobeyed, but the officer did not seem to mind.

HEADLINE: Mark Strengthens

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 3

 BODY:
The mark rose today on an unexpectedly large decline in German unemployment and signs of tax-reform progress in Russia, Germany's biggest borrower.
Germany said unemployment fell by 120,000 people in June, double the previous month's decline. The jobless rate fell to 10.5 percent, before seasonal adjustments, from May's unadjusted 10.9 percent. The data suggested that Germany's economic recovery was finally strengthening the job market, and contributed to speculation that the Bundesbank might raise interest rates. 
 The mark was also helped after the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, said Russia's threat to seize the property of Gazprom, Russia's biggest corporate tax delinquent, to force it to pay taxes was "a positive signal" that could help Russia repay debts.
In London trading, the dollar weakened to 1.8189 marks from 1.8205 in New York on Thursday.
In other markets, the South African currency plunged to a record low against the dollar for a second straight day. The rand settled at 6.37 to the dollar compared with 6.26 late Thursday, after falling to an all-time low of 6.44 earlier in the day.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN CHINA;
In Upbeat Farewell, Clinton Hails Jiang and Sees Democracy for China

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference given yesterday by President Clinton in Hong Kong at the end of his nine-day trip to China, as provided by The Associated Press:
I know most of the American journalists here are looking forward, as I am, to returning home for the Fourth of July. But I didn't want to leave China without first reflecting on the trip and giving you a chance to ask some questions. . . . 
 Over the past week, we have seen the glory of China's past in Xian, the vibrancy of its present in Beijing, the promise of its future in Shanghai and Hong Kong. I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to appreciate the remarkable transformation that is under way in China, as well as the distance still to be traveled. . . .
Here in Hong Kong we end the trip where I hope China's future begins -- a place where free expression and free markets flourish under the rule of law.
Clearly, China is changing, but there remain powerful forces resisting change, as evidenced by continuing governmental restrictions on free speech, assembly and freedom of worship.
One of the questions I have tried to frame on this trip for the future is how do we deal with these issues in a way most likely to promote progress. The answer, I think, is clear -- dealing directly, forcefully, but respectfully with the Chinese about our values.
Over the past week, I have engaged not only the leaders but the Chinese people about our experience and about the fact that democracy is a universal aspiration, about my conviction that in the 21st century, democracy also will be the right course practically as well as morally, yielding more stability and more progress.
At the same time, expanding our areas of cooperation with China advances our interests -- stability in Asia, nonproliferation, the rule of law, science and technology, fighting international crime and drugs, and protecting the environment.
The relationship between our two countries is terribly important. The hard work we've accomplished has put that relationship on a much more positive and productive footing -- that is good for America, good for China, good for Asia, good for the world. . . .
 
Goals of the Trip
QUESTION Mr. President, from your staff to President Jiang Zemin, it's been hailed as a success. Are we leaving here with one symbolic agreement?
I wonder if you could explain to us what exactly or how exactly you'll show your critics back in Congress that you did reach your expectations on this trip. Thank you.
MR. CLINTON Well, on the substance, I think we have reinforced our common commitment to regional security, which is terribly important, given the progress I believe can be made in the next several months, in the next couple of years in Korea, and the job we have to do in South Asia with India and Pakistan.
We made substantial progress in nonproliferation -- not only in detargeting, but in other areas as well.
We got a significant commitment from the Chinese to take another step toward full participation in the Missile Technology Control Regime.
We had an agreement on the rule of law, which I believe practically, these rule-of-law issues, I think will practically do an enormous amount to change the lives of ordinary Chinese citizens -- not only in regularizing commercial dealings, but in helping them with other daily problems that impinge on freedom if they're not fairly and fully resolved.
I'm pleased by the science and technology initiative that we signed, which has already produced significant benefits for both our people.
I'm very pleased that we now have a Peace Corps agreement with China. And I think we have really broken some ground in cooperation on the environment.
And again, I say I think China and the United States will both have heavy responsibilities to our own people and to the rest of the world in this area.
I believe that the fact that we debated openly these matters at the press conference of our disagreements is quite important as well.
And I might say that a lot of the democracy activists from Hong Kong said that they felt that in some ways the fact that we had this public discussion, the President of China and I, in the press conference might have a bigger impact over the long run on the human rights picture than anything else that happened here.
I have acknowledged in candor that we have not made as much progress on some of the trade issues as I had hoped, but I also now have a much clearer understanding of the Chinese perspective. I think they want to be in the W.T.O. World Trade Organization I think they want to assume the responsibilities of opening their markets and taking down barriers and allowing more investment. But I think understandably, since they are also committed to privatizing state-owned industries, they have big chucks of unemployment for which they have to create big chunks of employment. And they want to have a timing for W.T.O. membership that will permit them to continue to absorb into the work force people that are displaced from the state industries.
So I have an idea now about how we may be able to go back home, put our heads together and come up with another proposal or two that will enable us to push forward our trade agenda with the Chinese. . . .
 
Campaign Financing
Q. Mr. President, during your news conference with President Jiang, he mentioned that you raised campaign fund raising with him. And I wonder if you could share with us just what ideas you expressed to him. And also, since he said that the Chinese conducted an investigation and that they found the charges were totally absurd, did you suggest that he might want to cooperate with Justice Department and also congressional investigations?
A. Let me say, he is interested in a very -- in what I might call a narrow questions here; but a very important one; and in my mind, the most important one of all.
The question here -- the question that was raised that was most troubling was whether people at high levels in the Government of China had either sanctioned or participated in the channeling of funds in violation of American law not only into the Presidential campaign, but into a number of Congressional campaigns.
That charge has been made. He said they looked into that and that he was obviously certain. And I do believe him, that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing, and that he could find no evidence that anybody with governmental authority had done that.
He said that he could -- he could not speak to whether any people pursuing their own business interest had done that. He didn't say that it had happened or that he knew that it happened.
I want to make it clear -- he just said that his concern was on the governmental side.
And I just told him that that was the thing that we had to have an answer to; and that I appreciated that; and that if he were -- if the Government of China were contacted by any people doing their appropriate work, I would appreciate their telling him whatever that could tell them to help them to resolve that to their satisfaction, because I do think that is the really important issue.
Mr. Pelley.
 
The Dissidents
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Many democracy advocates were encouraged by your trip to China, and in fact, Bao Tung granted an interview to test the limits of Chinese tolerance.
But, sir, why did you find it impossible to meet with the democracy advocates in Beijing where it would have had the most impact? And would you feel compelled to intervene personally if Bao Tung is arrested after you leave?
A. Well, I have continued -- first, let me answer the second question first. I have continued to raise individual cases, and will continue to do so with the Chinese government and with the president.
I would very much like to see China reassess its position on categories of arrestees as well.
And let me just mention, for example, there probably are 150 people who are still incarcerated as a result of the events in Tiananmen Square who were convicted of nonviolent offenses.
There are also several people still incarcerated for a crime that is no longer a crime, that the Chinese themselves have said we no longer want, in effect, pursue people who have committed certain offenses against the state under which were basically a rubric for political dissidents. And I suggested that they look at that. So in all that, I would -- I will continue to be active.
On your first question, I did my best to meet with people who represented all elements of Chinese society and to do whatever I could to encourage democratic change.
The decisions I made on this trip -- as I remind you, the first trip by an American president in a decade -- about with whom to meet and how to handle it were basically designed -- were based on my best judgment about what would be most effective in expanding human rights.
And I think, at this moment, it looks like the decisions I made were correct, and we'll have to see over the course of time whether that is accurate or not.
Mr. Blitzer.
 
Abortions
Q. Mr. President, in the days leading up to your visit, there was very dramatic testimony in the U.S. Congress about forced abortions, allegations, reports that there were forced abortions still continuing in China. Did you specifically raise the issue of forced abortions with President Jiang Zemin? And if you did, what did he say to you about this allegation?
A. Well, they all say the same thing. They say that that is not Chinese policy and it violates Chinese policy.
My view is that if these reports are accurate, there may be an insufficient monitoring of what's being done beyond the capital and beyond the place where the orders are being handed out to the place where they are being -- the policy is being implemented.
And so I hope our presence here and our concern about this, which I might add was -- this issue was first raised most forcefully a couple of years ago by the first lady when she came to Beijing to speak at the women's conference.
I'm very hopeful that we will see some progress on this and that those who are making such reports will be able to tell us over the coming weeks and months that there has been some real progress.
Q. But did you raise it with President----
A. We talked about it briefly. And -- but they all say the same thing, Mr. Blitzer. They all say that this is not policy, that they've tried to make it clear. And I have tried to make it clear that it's something we feel very, very strongly about. . . .
 
Release of Prisoners
Q.Mr. President, if this trip is followed in the days or weeks to come by the piecemeal release of a few Chinese dissidents, will you consider that a success? And why not set a deadline for China to release all of its political prisoners?
And if I may, sir, you spoke a minute ago about the powerful forces resisting change in China. Do you believe there could ever be democracy here?
A. Oh, yes. The answer to the second question is yes. I believe there can be, and I believe there will be.
And what I would like to see is the present government, headed by this president and this premier, who are clearly committed to reform, ride the wave of change and take China fully into the 21st century and basically dismantle the resistance to it.
I believe they are -- not only do I believe there can be; I believe there will be.
Now, I believe that, again, on your first question, I think I have to do what I think is most effective. And obviously, I hope there will be further releases.
As I said, I would like to see not only targeted, selected, high-profile individual releases, which are very important, but I think that the next big step would be for China to look at whether there could be some expedited process to review the sentences of whole categories of people, because that would tend to show a change in policy rather than just the product of negotiation with the Americans.
In all fairness, while I very much value the role that I and our country have been able to play here, the best thing for China would be when no outside country is needed to advance the cause of human rights and democracy.
 
Taiwan
Q. Mr. President, the U.S. policy is push for negotiated reconciliation between the People's Republic and Taiwan. But some in Taiwan believe that by endorsing the three note you're administration is taking away some of the bargaining power that they would need in a negotiation. Does that concern you?
And can you tell us why you thought it was important to publicly articulate the three note policy when people in Taiwan were saying this would make things more difficult? . . .
A. First, I think that there may be some difference of opinion in Taiwan. But yesterday the Taiwanese leader, Mr. Lee, said that the United States had kept its commitments not to damage Taiwan or its interests in any way here.
I publicly stated that because I was asked questions in public about Taiwan and I thought it was an appropriate thing to do under the circumstances. But I did not announce any change in policy. In fact, the question of independence for Taiwan, for example, has been American policy for a very long time, and has been a policy that has been embraced by the government in Taiwan itself.
So, I believe that I did the right thing there to simply clarify to both sides that there had been no change in our policy.
The substance of the policy is obviously something that the Chinese Government agrees with. I think what the Taiwan Government wants to hear is that we favor the cross-straight dialogue, and we think has to be done peacefully and in an orderly fashion.
And that is, I believe, still the intention and the commitment of the Chinese Government. So I didn't intend, and I don't believe I did, change the substance of our position. . . .
 
Those Still in Jail
Q. Mr. President, during your trip -- in at least the first cities you visited -- we saw a sort of catch-and-release program of human rights dissidents, and of course, thousands of others are still in prison and labor camps.
Since you did not meet with them, sir, what would your message be to those who wanted to meet with you?
And to follow up on your response to an earlier question, why is it that you feel that it would not help their cause to have set down and met with some of them?
A. Because I believe over the long run what you want is a change in the policy and the attitude of the Chinese Government on whole -- not just on this, that or the other specific imprisoned dissident or threatened dissident, although those things are very important.
I don't want to minimize that. I'm glad Wei Jingsheng is out of jail. I'm glad the bishop's out of jail. I'm glad Wang Dan is out of jail. I think these things are important.
But what I am trying to do is to argue to the Chinese Government that, not because we're pressuring them publicly, but because it is the right thing to do -- the right thing to do -- that the whole policy should be changed.
And after all, our relationships have been characterized, I think, by significant misunderstandings, including a misunderstanding of the Chinese of our motive in raising these issues. And so I felt that by going directly to engage the Chinese, starting with the President, and especially taking advantage of the opportunity to have this free and open debate before all the Chinese people, I could do more in the short and in the long run to advance the cause of human rights. . . .
 
Assessing President Jiang
Q. Mr. President, you spent considerable time with President Jiang Zemin this week both in public and in private. I wonder if you could give us your assessment of him, not only as a strategic partner, but as a leader and as an agent for change in China.
A. Well, first of all, you know I have a very high regard for his abilities. I remember not so many years ago there was a -- the conventional wisdom was that he might be a transitional figure and after I met with him the first time I felt very strongly that his chances of becoming the leader of China for a sustained period were quite good because he's a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot of vigor for his age, or indeed for any age. And I think he has a quality that is profoundly important at this moment in our history when there is so much change going on. He has a good imagination. He has vision. He can visualize. He can image a future that is different from the present.
And he has, I think, a very able partner in Premier Zhu Rongji who has enormous technical competence and an almost legendary distaste for stalling and bureaucracy and just staying in the same path even if it's not working.
So my view is that the potential we have for a strategic partnership is quite strong. However, I think that like everyone else he has constituencies with which he must work and I hope that more of them are now more convinced that we can build a good positive partnership as a result of this trip.
I hope more of them understand that America wishes China well, that we are not bent on containing China, and that our human rights policy is not an excuse for some larger strategic motive.
It's what we really believe. We believe it's morally right, and we believe it's best for them as a practical matter over the long run.
So I believe that there's a very good chance if China has the right leadership at the right time, and that they understand the daunting, massive nature of the challenges they face.
They want us to understand that there is much more personal freedom now in the practical sense for most Chinese than there was when President Nixon came here or 10 years ago. But I think they understand that this is an unfolding process and they have to keep going. And I hope that we can be a positive force there. . . .

CORRECTION-DATE: July 7, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Excerpts on Saturday from President Clinton's news conference in Hong Kong, transcribed by The Associated Press, rendered a phrase incorrectly in referring to United States policy toward Taiwan. It is "the three noes policy," not the "three note policy." ("Three noes" refers to a State Department statement last fall that Washington did not support Taiwan independence, did not favor "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and did not back Taiwan membership in international organizations made up of sovereign countries.)

Say Hay

BYLINE: By Brenda Maddox; Brenda Maddox's biography of William Butler Yeats will be published next spring.

 BODY:
When the partner of the San Francisco writer Armistead Maupin first heard of Hay-on-Wye, he shouted, "And hold the mayo!" He was not to know that Arthur Miller had made the same joke years ago. Miller, when first invited to go there, quipped: "Hay-on-Wye? Is that some kind of sandwich?"
Hay-on-Wye should be self-explanatory: a town called Hay on a river named Wye. The little Welsh Borders market town sits at the foot of the Black Mountains, the long dark ridge that divides England from Wales. There may be prettier sights in the world than the 45-degree angle of Hay Bluff falling to the green meadows of the Wye valley floor. I just have not seen them. 
 At the end of every May, a throng of writers, readers, teachers and literary groupies descends on the town of 1,200 for the annual Hay Literary Festival. In the informal and intimate surroundings of a local primary school, enlarged by marquees during the Whitsun vacation week, they can sit at the feet of the likes of Alison Lurie, Toni Morrison, Muriel Spark, P. D. James, Maya Angelou, Jay McInerney, Stephen Fry or -- science being a big draw at Hay -- Stephen Jay Gould and Fred Hoyle.
As Hay's reputation has grown over the past decade, bigger and bigger international names have accepted the invitation of the festival's serene young director, the actor Peter Florence. Many Americans arrive without having a clue where they are. Wales, unlike Scotland or Ireland, does not rate high on the American ethnicity scale, and the Welsh Borders seldom appear on the tourist itinerary.
Once initiated, however, the celebrities tend to come back and back, especially if, like Arthur Miller and Lauren Bacall, they merit accommodation in the faux-baronial splendor of Llangoed Hall, Sir Bernard Ashley's five-star hotel with croquet lawn and helipad.
The stamp of approval of Hay as the most fashionable of British literary festivals has come from the Anglophile New Yorker magazine. For the past three years the editor, Tina Brown, seeing the Hay festival as the best place to meet the best of British writers, has flown in a team for a debate with The Sunday Times of London (the festival's sponsor) on a topic of burning interest. This year The New Yorker lost, not surprisingly, as its proposal -- "That the private lives of public figures should remain private" -- sounded dodgy coming from a magazine not shy of exposing politicians and stars.
To call Hay a "market town" is a bit of a touristic euphemism. Its market is secondhand books. Bookstores fill the town, occupying vacated premises, from a former cinema to a Victorian military drill hall. Increasingly narrow specialties are catered to. Balkan books, anybody? Try Marijana Dworski on Lion Street.
An eclectic architectural mix of Norman, Elizabethan, Georgian and Victorian, Hay is kind to its visitors. There is always paper in the public lavatory. But it is, and always has been, in a state of identity crisis. The English-Welsh border runs through the town, which has belonged, at various times over the centuries, to England, to Wales and to Normandy. Technically in Wales, its postal address specifies "via Hereford," the big English city 20 miles away, which offers the nearest train connection (three hours) to London.
Truth to tell, Hay-on-Wye is teetering on the edge of self-parody. A never-never land waiting to be turned into a theme park, it has already been turned into a kingdom. In 1961, Richard Booth, a tall, portly Oxford man, spotted the low-rent potential of some vacant buildings here and opened the first of a string of bookshops. In 1977 he crowned himself King of Hay and threatened to secede from Britain. The predictable publicity followed.
The King, as his friends call him, is a genuine eccentric as well as businessman. He lives in the 13th-century castle in the center of town. He has no difficulty keeping a straight face when, wearing a gilt cardboard crown and carrying a scepter made of a plumber's ball cock, he delivers a monotone harangue against the Wales Tourist Board.
When the festival began in 1989, Booth turned his back. "I never met an author who wrote a secondhand book," he said. Now mellowed by age, illness and success at founding book towns elsewhere, he has been spotted sitting in the festival audience and next year may even take part.
Feuds are endemic to Hay. King Richard's main opponent is Leon Morelli, a rival bookseller who moved into town, running his shops with less charisma but more discipline. The festival itself has split the town. When Peter Florence and his father, who founded the festival, proposed to build a permanent site along the Wye, local conservationists swiftly formed Friends of the North Bank. The Friends successfully fought to preserve unspoiled the view of Hay from the river as described by the Rev. Francis Kilvert, the Victorian diarist, writing from his rectory at Clyro on the opposite bank.
Kilvert's diaries, written between 1870 and 1879, have been called the finest diaries in the English language after Pepys. Kilvert, were he to return, would be surprised to find his walks in the Black Mountains now being retraced by devoted members of the Kilvert Society. Each year's festival opens with a Kilvert Walk. The bachelor curate would also be surprised to find pages from his diaries offered on the World Wide Web under "Famous British Pedophiles," thanks to his vivid descriptions of farmers zealously chastising their nubile daughters.
Maybe this overhanging clerical presence is what gives the festival a theological preoccupation. Hay audiences -- white-haired middle-income Middle Englanders -- are great questioners. When some 1,000 pack the big tent to hear famous scientists talk about the origin of the universe, what they really want to know is whether the scientists believe in God.
This year Richard Dawkins, author of "The Selfish Gene," was asked, "Are you still as godless as you were?" And, "Is the human race still evolving?" Dawkins's eyes rolled to the heaven he doesn't believe in, as for the zillionth time he heard the familiar questions. The answer to both was "Yes."
Stephen Hawking, the author of "A Brief History of Time," got the same treatment. Did he recognize the importance of the spiritual side of people? The audience clearly expected that a man in Hawking's predicament might need the consolations of religion. He doesn't. Slumped like a folded bat in his motorized wheelchair, he croaked out his reply on his voice synthesizer: "When the physical universe is fully explained by a Theory of Everything, we will not need 'nonphysical entities.' I hate mysticism. I like things crystal clear."
What has swollen the festival from a few thousand to the 39,000 or so there in May, including about 1,000 Americans, is its intimate atmosphere: a combination of summer camp and religious retreat. Big-name musicians (Van Morrison last year) and stand-up comics also turn up to provide night life -- not otherwise Hay's strong suit.
There is no need to go to everything at the 10-day festival to come away with nuggets of wit and wisdom.
Peter Carey, on being an Australian novelist: "Britain is the reality for former colonial countries. In Australia I grew up with a feeling of not being in the real place, that the real landscape was the green one, not the brown."
Armistead Maupin on "Tales of the City": "I'm a gay author. I don't like to mince words." (A pause, as laughter began to rise.) "I don't like to mince at all."
Helen Fielding on her best seller, "Bridget Jones's Diary": "It's a singleness-of-Diana book: a woman trying to be independent and it not quite working out."
Hay is worth a detour any time of the year for anyone who loves old books and doesn't mind rain or the smell of mildew. Even if you don't find the book you've long been searching for, its 36 bookshops are great places to come across the unexpected.
Local farmers used to scoff at the whole arty Hay-on-Wye scene. Now, with their beef banned on the Continent because of mad cow disease, and with the world turning vegetarian, they watch the rural economy decline. Malcolm Evans of Defynnog recently sent a poem to the local paper entitled "What Have Farmers Done Wrong?": "Working hard and caring lots / They used to be enough. / Now I have to fight the law / Cos it can get real rough!"
Would Evans have turned to verse if Hay-on-Wye had not been taken over by the literati? My bet is that in a few years he and fellow farmers will find themselves selling secondhand books.

HEADLINE: Two Views From the Greenhouse

BYLINE: By William J. Broad; William J. Broad is a science reporter for The New York Times and author of "The Universe Below: Discovering the Secrets of the Deep Sea."

 BODY:

Is the Temperature Rising?
 The Uncertain Science of Global Warming.
 By S. George Philander.
 Illustrated. 262 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
 Princeton University Press. $29.95.
 
 Climate of Fear
 Why We Shouldn't Worry
 About Global Warming.
 By Thomas Gale Moore.
 Illustrated. 175 pp. Washington:
 Cato Institute. $18.95. 
 A secret of science is that its luminaries have always done the easiest things first, contrary to many claims and myths. Newton ignored the messiness of the real world. His gravitational law showed that two planetary bodies could grip each other invisibly. But his mathematical rigor failed to account for the mutual attractions of three bodies, like the earth, moon and sun. That took the efforts of many successors.
Exploring problems of even greater complexity, Lavoisier, and then Mendeleev, helped reveal scores of chemical elements and their odd, recurring similarities. Darwin and Mendel shed light on the tangle of life. And in our own time, scientists are addressing such riddles as the substructure of the atom, the fate of the universe and the workings of the human brain.
Which brings us to climate change, one of the knottiest scientific problems of all. What we lightly call the climate system is actually trillions of variables in flux over billions of years. The factors include wind, rain, ice, clouds, snow, storms, lightning, comets, asteroids, sunlight, land size, sea currents, magnetic fields, cosmic rays, volcanic dust and life itself. In ages past, the atmosphere had little oxygen. But plants arose and changed that. The only constant seems to be variability, as suggested by the planet's erratic cycles of cold and warmth.
Can this turmoil be fathomed and its evolutionary path forecast? More important for world leaders, can we distinguish the natural changes in meteorological conditions from those induced by humans?
Scientists face the riot of variables only with the help of vast simplifications and the world's most powerful computers. To complicate matters, the field itself is in transition as the science improves and experts grow in number. Climate change was once viewed as slow. But recent studies have disclosed past temperature swings so sudden that in theory New England could have Miami-like weather in as little as 25 years. On the other hand, methane, seen as a major spur to global warming, now appears to be accumulating in the atmosphere more slowly than predicted, seeming to reduce the risk of crisis. Moreover, conflicting data are often communicated to the public by environmental zealots at either end of the political spectrum, obscuring things still further.
Into this wilderness comes S. George Philander, a geoscientist at Princeton who writes with skill and cool reserve. "Is the Temperature Rising? The Uncertain Science of Global Warming" is a careful, step-by-step look at confusing data and clarifying science. He is literate, quoting Shelley, Coleridge and Eliot. And he is reasonably sure we are digging our own grave, though he says so with such understatement that it is easy to overlook the doom and gloom.
Rather adroitly, Philander explains why scientists worry about the global rash of fires, generating plants and factories that release carbon dioxide at a furious pace. When sunlight bathes the earth and reflects back into the sky as heat, he says, the radiations have "so little energy that they are unable to interact with the diatomic molecules that account for most of the atmosphere." Such bypassed molecules are mainly pairs of oxygen atoms and pairs of nitrogen atoms. The trouble arises when the weak radiations are absorbed by triatomic and other complex gases, including carbon dioxide, ozone, methane and water vapor. These trap heat in the atmosphere, much like glass in a greenhouse. The question is whether the heat is rising and how much.
To address that puzzle, Philander examines issues such as those raised by clouds. If greenhouse heat evaporates some of the sea and increases water vapor in the atmosphere, the planet may grow hotter still, since the mist is a major greenhouse gas. But, he adds, if the added vapor condenses widely, the earth may cool, since white, fluffy, abundant clouds reflect more sunlight back into space. An added twist is that individual clouds heat or cool the earth depending on their exact form. Clouds, Philander says, are the main wild card in the warming game. Driving the point home, he asks readers to imagine computer simulations "as whimsical as clouds!"
The book's science is clear but formidable. We meet latent heat, quantum theory, the photoelectric effect, the hydrological cycle and plate tectonics, some explained better than others. Equations dot the text and pervade 13 appendixes. Many illustrations aid comprehension. But they, too, tend to be esoteric, with temperatures, for instance, always given in the Celsius scale.
Like a windy but stimulating uncle, Philander also takes us on detours, some tedious. Who cares why water is a poor thermometer fluid? But what fun to learn that weather experts around the globe release 700 balloons every noon and midnight Greenwich mean time and share the resulting data, friend and foe alike. People, he observes, are "more truly united in this activity than any other."
For all its detail, the book makes no mention of such current research topics as the extent to which the air is warmed by the sun's variable brightness, newly discovered in the 11-year sunspot cycle and suspected to occur over longer periods. Nor does it adequately explore whether terrestrial reactions to atmospheric upsets can curb greenhouse warming. "The carbon cycle amounts to a thermostat that keeps temperatures in a moderate range," it says provocatively, missing the obvious follow-up.
At the book's close, Philander draws together some of his strands and concludes that humankind is playing with fire. The problem, he concedes, is "enormously complex." But the balance of evidence, he warns, suggests that serious problems lie ahead unless we take drastic steps to curtail the buildup of greenhouse gases: "The growth is exponential, a dangerous situation that calls for action long before there is clear evidence of impending trouble."
Thomas Gale Moore, an economist at the Hoover Institution in California, rejects such alarm. "Climate of Fear: Why We Shouldn't Worry About Global Warming" argues that any rise in temperatures is likely to help Americans, if not poor people in the tropics. Moore's optimism is similar to that of Svante August Arrhenius, the Swedish chemist who late in the 19th century first proposed that rises in industrial gases might produce "ages with more equable and better climates." Of the greenhouse idea itself, however, Moore is skeptical: "The theory is weak and the models on which the conclusions are based cannot even replicate the current climate." For the sake of argument, he nonetheless assumes that moderate warming may occur, and he explores possible costs and benefits.
First, he reviews the growing literature on past climes and concludes that warm ones favored humans. For instance, balmy weather 800 to 1,200 years ago allowed people in Britain, Prussia and Norway to grow grapes and make wine. "Mankind prospered during warm periods and suffered during cold ones," he writes. He then looks at global warming in the next century. He faults doomsayers as exaggerating woes and ignoring benefits. In sports, he says, pessimists see declines in skiing but overlook rises in golf, camping, tennis, canoeing, hiking and bicycling.
His own tally for the United States from global warming estimates annual costs of $6 billion from such things as smog, wetland loss, hurricane damage and new dikes needed to hold back rising seas. On the plus side, he finds $99 billion in benefits from saved lives, improved health, new recreational and life-style amenities, lower heating bills, new construction and added water supplies.
He ends with an analysis of the costs of greenhouse curbs like those spelled out in the recent accords reached in Kyoto, Japan, and judges them staggering and silly. Moore, who was a member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, concludes that "the best strategy is to maintain the status quo, continue research on climate and help poor countries improve their economies."
Economics, perhaps no less than climatology and other disciplines that probe complexity, has a hard time foreseeing change. Its subject matter, after all, is people, whose behavior is famously at odds with expert prediction. Moore may be as unrealistic as the prophets of doom, perhaps more so. The truth is that we all live in a great climate experiment, the outcome of which, good or bad, no one is likely to forecast with any certitude.

ANNALS OF THE FORMER WORLD
 By John McPhee.
 Maps. 696 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $35. 
 About 20 years ago John McPhee, until then a writer whose graceful small books had reflected whimsical enthusiasms, muted concerns and discreet bemusements, decided to tackle something big: planet Earth. More specifically, he set out to describe the structure and dynamics of the lithosphere (that is, the planet's stony crust and the fluid mantle that lies beneath) as understood by the science of geology. Plate tectonics, the theory of sliding and colliding crustal slabs and of mobile continents aboard them like igloos on ice floes, would be his central theme. That theory had broken through to acceptance only in the late 1960's (decades after it was first proposed), rushing in upon geologic orthodoxy
like student revolutionaries storming the palace. Its belated arrival, and its astonishing content, promised the framework of a good story. Characteristically, McPhee undertook to tell the tale in an orderly, unassuming way: he would travel back and forth across the United States on Interstate 80, in the company of several well-chosen geologists, looking over each scientist's shoulder while he or she read clues from the exposed rock of road cuts. The jake brakes of speeding semis would serve as soundtrack for a paradigm shift.
As first conceived, this had seemed a modest project that would yield maybe a long article for The New Yorker, or a short book, representing "a sort of cross section of North America at about the 40th parallel, and a picture of the science," McPhee recalls. After a year's travel, he transcribed his notes and roughed out a structural plan, then saw that what he'd outlined was not one book but a handful -- enough, in fact, to "keep me writing for more years than I wanted to spend consecutively on the subject." So he chose to write them intermittently with other work. "Basin and Range" appeared in 1981; "In Suspect Terrain," two years later; "Rising From the Plains" in 1986; and "Assembling California" in 1993. Those four deal with the more overtly dramatic rock of America's eastern and western extremes -- the tectonically rumpled mountains, valleys and faults of the Appalachian region, the Rockies and the Far West. Characters and ideas reappear among them. "Annals of the Former World" now gathers all four together into the Gondwanaland they were always meant to be. It also offers a narrative table of contents, by way of preface, and a new essay titled "Crossing the Craton," which explains why the great American Midwest -- the zone McPhee previously left unexplored -- is not quite so flat and dull as it seems. The combined result is, in some senses, a big book. There are many pages, many facts, many nifty turns of phrase and deadpan ironies and many, many different names for varieties of rock.
McPhee has been fascinated by this science, it seems, since he took his first course at the age of 17. "I used to sit in class and listen to the terms come floating down the room like paper airplanes. Geology was called a descriptive science, and with its pitted outwash plains and drowned rivers, its hanging tributaries and starved coastlines, it was nothing if not descriptive. It was a fountain of metaphor." Given his own estimable talent for description, and his disciplined reluctance to stretch beyond it, the match of writer to subject might seem congenial. Then again, it's perhaps too congenial for comfort; he writes of geology with the ardor of an aficionado, not from his more customary perspective -- of ignorant but curious outsider to any given subject, standing as proxy for the ignorant but curious reader. Those geologists who early captured his admiration communicated in English as opposed to math, McPhee notes approvingly, and "they could name things in a manner that sent shivers through the bones." Maybe. But his own invocations of discordant batholiths, mosaic conglomerates, plagioclase crystals, stratiform gabbros, not to mention migmatite, tincalconite, szaibelyite and phlogopite, don't send shivers through my bones. Still, his prose is never less than musical, even when the music may be cool and opaque.
Of the four interconnected books, each claims its own wedge of the subject, and each features its own presiding expert. "Basin and Range" eases into plate tectonics by exploring the peculiar mountain-and-valley striations in Nevada and western Utah, with help from a Princeton professor of geology named Kenneth Deffeyes, "a big man with a tenured waistline," whose hair "flies behind him like Ludwig van Beethoven's" and who lectures in sneakers. McPhee joins the Beethovian rockmeister on a road trip in quest of insight and economically exploitable silver-ore tailings. "In Suspect Terrain" presents a skeptical critique of the airier leaps of tectonic theory, courtesy of a down-to-bedrock field geologist named Anita Harris. She fled from a Brooklyn tenement upbringing into professional geology and became a world authority on the mysterious little fossils called conodonts, a specialty that seemed hopelessly arcane until conodonts proved useful for finding oil. "Rising From the Plains" surveys the eloquent rock exposures of Wyoming, which reveal a taller column of earth history than visible anywhere else on Interstate 80 between New York and San Francisco. McPhee's guide here is David Love, known as "the grand old man of Rocky Mountain geology," who himself rose to eminence from an isolated ranch in central Wyoming. Finally, "Assembling California" follows the travels and thinking of a tectonicist named Eldridge Moores, by way of wondering where that state came from (it seems to have floated up in sections and added itself to the continent like a redwood deck) and where it will go next. Those, plus the new essay on the Stable Interior Craton, the flat fundament beneath the Midwest, are the major elements of this book.
But of course there's much more. To complement the living experts, there are deft cameo portraits of such scientific precursors as Louis Agassiz and James Hutton, and character studies of more obscure figures -- most notably David Love's diary-keeping mother, a clear-eyed pioneer woman whose ghost carries the narrative structure of "Rising From the Plains." In addition to the long expository marches through deep time and layered rock, there are digressions recounting the California gold rush, the legend of Winona the Indian maiden and the collapsing freeways of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake. As in any McPhee work, there are gemlike sentences, richly rhythmic paragraphs, nicely burnished synecdoches, metaphors as pungent as wasabi and, behind those felicities, vast amounts of painstaking research. There's the grandeur of plate tectonics itself, explained with exhausting thoroughness and, for the most part, clarity. Is all this enough to make "Annals of the Former World" a formidable and compelling book? Well, sorry: in my view, no.
WHY not? Because, though it's full of wonderful expository prose, it's virtually bereft of anything else. There's no argument, no urgency, no passion, no sense of larger purpose or emergent meaning, no point to the whole -- beyond the bland point that geology is interesting. (There's no bibliography, either, an inexplicable discourtesy both to readers and to the many scientists upon whose published papers and books this volume draws.) McPhee is an elegant stylist, but to say that his authorial voice is muffled and reticent would be an understatement. His work is full of ideas, though scarcely ever one of his own. He seems to stroll the world's landscape, alert but undemonstrative, keeping his hands in his pockets and his thoughts to himself.
About this signature self-restraint, there are two schools of opinion. One school includes those such as William L. Howarth (a Princeton professor of English and, two decades ago, editor of "The John McPhee Reader"), who venerates him for the fact that he "never confesses, rarely preaches," and therefore offers an antithesis to "the so-called New Journalists, those celebrities who parade their neuroses or stump for public causes," as Howarth grumbled in his introduction to that early sampler. On the other hand are appreciative but frustrated readers who wish McPhee would say more, give more, risk more -- that he would surprise us occasionally with a resonant self-revelation or a fierce conviction, that he would write with his whole person and not just with his brain. Of these two schools, I once counted myself among the first; but over the years since McPhee began publishing the installments of his geology opus, I've felt myself drift into the second. His rocklike consistency of method, his adamantine reserve have delighted me less and less. Undeniably, John McPhee is a master craftsman who simply doesn't make mistakes -- except maybe an elemental one: the mistake of impeccable caution.

Seattle: Latte for a Little

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; JESSE McKINLEY writes for The City section of The Times.

 BODY:
TO twist the words of Will Rogers, Seattle never met a fad it didn't like. From the early gold-rushers who put the city on the map to the coffee-swilling entrepreneurs who made $2 java a national obsession, the denizens of the city by the sound have always had a keen sense of what was hot -- and profitable. While most of the world was flying by propellers, in Seattle, Boeing began making jets. And when rock and roll was fading, Seattle spawned grunge.
This knack for trendsetting has made it a favorite of the young and restless. I, meanwhile, have always been a little behind the curve, a man who invested in an electric typewriter just about the time that personal computers -- another Seattle specialty -- began popping up on desktops. 
 So, in the hope of gleaning a sense of the future from this forward-looking burg, I traveled to Seattle for four days in early June, just a few weeks after the blossoming of the city's rhododendrons, and just about when its notoriously wet weather starts to give way to more temperate conditions. I knew that such a short-term search for the Zeitgeist would probably be futile, but I also suspected I would have a good time looking.
I was late in getting a ticket, of course, and lost out on the cheaper 14-day advance fares. I checked airline consolidators, who acquire tickets in bulk and sell them at cut-rate prices; they were offering fares in the $450 range, tax included. I wanted something cheaper.
In the spirit of Seattle's favorite son, Bill Gates, I took to the Internet, checking a service called Priceline (priceline.com), where you name the price you wish to pay and then wait to see if an airline will match your bid. The process is advertised as taking an hour and a credit card; I had both.
My first offer was $300, leaving within a week from any New York City airport and agreeing to one stopover each way. I typed in my dates, my e-mail address, and my credit card number and sure enough, an hour later, the computer responded: No dice. I plowed through the application again, this time bidding $320. "Sorry," read the reply.
I had just about resigned myself to the consolidator ticket, but decided to move up my trip by a couple of days and try $350. Bingo: A $350 round trip, tax included, on America West, with a stopover in Phoenix.
My Rough Guide to the United States told me that accommodations in downtown Seattle generally were either snazzy or sleazy; decent midrange lodgings were usually outside the city center. I turned again to the Web, searching seattle.yahoo.com, and found an ad for the Seattle Inn, "the preferred economy inn of downtown Seattle." The site showed inviting pictures of an indoor pool and the Space Needle -- the symbol of the 1962 world's fair -- hovering just above the hotel's roof. The price: $60 for a single, with an additional 10 percent off for reserving by e-mail.
The final logistical detail was a car. A representative at America West suggested Avis, which set me up with a terrific springtime deal: $99 for five days and unlimited mileage.
Mind you, after a 10-hour journey to Seattle via Arizona, I was in no mood to drive. And the dusk and fog looming over the city made my first impressions fairly grim. The Kingdome, the city's aging stadium, sat hulking and gray to the left, while in the distance, the Space Needle seemed almost limp in the damp air, with two of its three legs wrapped in billowy pink construction netting. (Depression threatened. Ah, where is Frasier Crane when you need him?)
My spirits lifted when I got to the hotel, which had a motor lodge feel but a very friendly staff. My room was small and the towels even smaller, but it was clean, comfortable and equipped with cable. I thought about a swim; in that weather, however, the last thing I wanted to do was get wet.
I awoke to a sunny day and a view of the Needle, with its U.F.O.-shaped pinnacle nicely framed against a blue sky.
Seattle rises on a series of lush hills with saltwater Puget Sound to the west and the freshwater Lake Washington to the east. This sloped, spindly topography creates one of the city's ironies: While individual areas are pedestrian friendly, you almost always must drive to get to the place where you can walk. (Interstate 5 separates the east and west parts of the city, while a finger of Lake Washington separates north and south.)
The isolated pockets have fostered a mix of distinct neighborhoods, from the sedate elegance of Queen Anne, north of downtown, to the taste treats in the gritty International District, where Thai and Chinese food are plentiful. My personal favorite was Capitol Hill, on the city's eastern slopes, home of some of Seattle's most quirky restaurants and bars as well as a large gay and student community. I spent almost all of my second day there, on Broadway, and ate at two of the city's nicest cheap dining spots, the Broadway New American Grill and Cafe Septieme.
But my first day was spent downtown, where, still groggy, the first goal of the first day was to sample that dark, steamy and decidedly peppy local beverage. I quickly happened on one of many branches of a place called (what else?) Seattle's Best Coffee, on Second Avenue. The store offered all sorts of exotic variations, from the high-caffeine coffee coffee milkshake to something called an Oregon Chai Tea Latte; I chose a simple tumbler of house blend ($1.45). My haze lifted.
The first brush with a possible fad came right around the corner at the Three Dog Bakery, a new store catering to the untapped market for pastries, cakes and other delectables aimed at an exclusively canine clientele. Though the dog biscotti looked appetizing, I refrained and moved on to more human delights at the Pike Place Market.
The turn-of-the-century downtown marketplace was almost demolished in 1971, during one of Seattle's numerous fits of reinvention. Instead, civic leaders undertook a classy refurbishment, complete with red brick streets and flower-lined alleys. Its dozens of stands sell the best of the region's natural bounty, including just-caught Dungeness crabs, as well as pungent displays of cut roses and freshly baked bread. "Fish up!" shouted a wisecracking salesman at Pike Place Fish Company, throwing a giant slab of fish about 10 feet to a waiting comrade. "Get 'em while they're frish."
I also found a tourist-information stand offering free maps and weekly guides -- and, at noon daily, half-price same-day tickets on anything from opera to cruises. One of the best deals at the market is the Three Girls Bakery, a luncheon that is usually packed and dates back to 1912. Ihad an enormous sourdough and pastrami sandwich ($4.25), and trundled down through the market's four stories of shops toward the harbor.
While the waterfront primarily comprises kitsch shops and fish-and-chip stands, two diversions lured me in. The first was the Seattle Aquarium, where I bought a City Pass ($23.75), which equates to half-price admission to six different Seattle attractions. The aquarium's collection was modest, but swarmed by children. I was especially entranced by the clouds of freshly hatched salmon, all swimming in perfect rows in a circular tank.
The exhibits, strangely enough, piqued my appetite. I headed to Ivar's Acres of Clams, a Seattle institution founded by Ivar Haglund, an eccentric old entrepreneur whose motto was "Keep Clam!" Between the market's fish staff and Mr. Haglund's wit, I determined that bad puns must be an occupational hazard for Northwestern fish merchants.
I ordered a four-piece meal of fish and chips ($4.95) and watched the locals feed the gulls. "Sea gull lovers are welcome," reads a quote from Mr. Haglund, who died in 1985. "Please do not feed the pigeons."
A TROLLEY runs the length of the waterfront, but I walked inland a bit to Pioneer Square, a tree-lined promenade and the jumping-off point for a past generation of treasure seekers. I stopped into the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park museum (free), which gives a fine overview of the continent's last great gold rush. It began just over 100 years ago when the S.S. Portland docked in Seattle with two tons of nuggets. The rush petered out a few years later, but the crush of would-be millionaires buying supplies in Seattle for the trip north pulled the little lumber town into the 20th century.
As the crowds streamed south toward the Kingdome for a Seattle Mariners game, I moved north up First Avenue against the current (just like a good salmon).
First Avenue, downtown's main drag, is eclectic, reflecting both the progressive present and frontier past. Chic boutiques and the Seattle Art Museum (a City Pass locale) sit side by side with gun shops and X-rated movie houses.
Darkness was falling as I followed First Avenue uptown, stumbling into Belltown, an emergent district on the northern fringe of downtown. I counted six trendy-looking restaurants on a single block, complete with $14 entrees and skinnier-than-thou waitresses. I moved a little farther north to the Belltown Pub, a handsome bistro featuring two dozen local microbrews and $7 burgers. I chose a pint of something called Mac and Jack's African Amber and a cheeseburger.
I finished the night at the Crocodile Cafe, a bar-cum-club-cum-greasy spoon where local grunge legends Nirvana and Pearl Jam used to play. Decorated with giant papier-mache reptiles, the Crocodile had four bands on tap for $6. I listened intently, half expecting to hear The Next Big Thing. As it turned out, the first entertainer that night had been imported from Australia. Stomach filled, feet tired, ears sated, I retired.
I drove up to Capitol Hill on Saturday, catching the breakfast buffet ($7.95) at the Broadway New American Grill, a sunny, stylish diner with sidewalk tables and a collection of Miro-inspired sculpture. From there, I walked up Broadway, enjoying the colorful tile fringe on the sidewalk and the flowering dogwood and dahlias.
With Seattle University to the south and the University of Washington to the north, Capitol Hill is awash with young artists and music stores and coffeehouses that cater to them. One exemplar is Habitat Espresso, a petition-laden nonprofit enterprise on Broadway with weekly readings of plays, screenplays and poetry. I was a little intimidated by the T-shirt worn by the tattooed counterman: "Sit. Consume. Die." But the coffee was good and strong.
The remainder of the day was spent the hilltop views in nearby Volunteer Park (where I saw an exhibit at the Seattle Asian Art Museum), the park's Conservatory (where I wandered hothouse rooms full of flora, also gratis), and the Japanese Garden at Washington Park Arboretum. (Did I mention that the coffee was strong?)
After a quick portobello mushroom sandwich ($7) at Cafe Septieme, I bopped along with the bustle of Broadway, cutting along side streets and finally ending up in the Baltic Room, a 1930's style speak-easy with nightly jazz, a $3 cover and a clientele that likes to dress with an eye toward the Jazz Age.
I settled in sleepily at the lovely Gaslight Inn, a restored Victorian bed-and-breakfast with a sun-drenched deck and a small outdoor pool. My single room with four-poster bed and a shared bath was $73 a night, tax included.
Sunday was a consummate Seattle day: rainy. I took shelter in the city's museums, and used the City Pass to hit the Museum of Flight's fantastic aeronautic displays, the kid-oriented Pacific Science Center (who knew I would weigh 410 pounds on Jupiter?) and, of course, the 605-foot Space Needle, from which I saw the ghostly pink-tinted peak of Mount Rainier hovering on the southern horizon.
Having been landbound my first three days, I made water sports the goal of my last. My plan for the evening included oysters ($9.25 for six at the grand old McCormick and Schmick's) and fish (an indulgent $16 halibut dish at Flying Fish).
But my first stop was the ferry to Bainbridge Island ($3.60 round trip), a large suburb eight miles across Puget Sound. The sun had burned through the morning clouds, and bright white streaks flashed across the sound's deep water. Sailboats glided by; I settled back for the ride.
As the modern skyline shrunk in the distance, I looked around. Most of my fellow passengers were smiling, eyes closed, faces warmed by the sun.
For such renowned trendsetters, Seattle's citizenry seemed positively content in the face of the next millennium. Then again, I thought, maybe they're just thinking of what they are going to do next.
 
The bottom line
 Including meals, room and car rental, I spent an average of $110 a day in four days in Seattle. Two good investments were "Seattle Best Places," by Nancy Leson and Stephanie Irving, (Sasquatch Books, $16.95), and a City Pass ($23.75), which offers admission to six Seattle attractions: the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, Woodland Park Zoo, Seattle Aquarium, Seattle Art Museum and Museum of Flight.
I bought my plane ticket, $350 round trip, two days in advance through Priceline (www.priceline.com). During the current high season, 14-day advance-purchase fares on most major airlines should be in the $400 range.

HEADLINE: The War Between the States ... and Washington

BYLINE: By Garry Wills; Garry Wills is a frequent contributor to the magazine. In January he wrote about how cultural issues are replacing traditional geopolitcs.

 BODY:
Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights. The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the second (to bear arms). Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th (powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few people tried to "take the 10th" the way gangsters and fellow travelers "took the fifth."
But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run. Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of power from the Federal to the state level. Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis thought up for them, "laboratories of democracy." Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying in the wilderness for many years. 
 The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting, altering or killing programs. In education alone, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to gather on public grounds.
In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and passed "three strikes" laws. They have experimented with "truth in sentencing" (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative sentencing and victims' compensation.
In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps, mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners' benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new protected areas and successfully defied Federal regulations (for example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York v. United States in 1992).
On health, they have considered regulations on assisted suicide, H.M.O.'s, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS patients.
On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated Federal restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead of Federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises (Depression, world war, cold war) led to central mobilization and control of resources. But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of isolating states from the national society.
California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald Reagan went forth from California to shrink the Federal Government and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby (his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system. The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the lobbyists' sway -- but have increased all four.
Peter Schrag, in his sobering new book, "Paradise Lost," describes what occurred at the first great turnovers of office, six years after term limits passed in 1990: "By general agreement, the 1995-'96 term-limits-crunch session of the California Legislature was probably the most mean-spirited and unproductive in memory, a unique combination of instability, bad behavior, political frenzy and legislative paralysis. In the two years between 1995 and 1997, California had five Assembly Speakers, two different Republican Assembly leaders, two Republican Senate leaders and eight special legislative elections, not counting runoffs, among them three recalls."
It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in California. Some local programs have shown initial promise -- school vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in Maine. Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live under Republican governors.
The foremost champion of local control among the governors is Tommy Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500), who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. "We started it," he says. "I was the front-runner because I started looking at the Federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington and get waivers." Such waivers are special dispensations from Federal regulations. "I'm the only governor who still has waivers in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed Federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare."
Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an innovator. In education, he fought truancy with "Learnfare" and set up choice schools, charter schools, "prep tech" and apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks of a "broad menu" of options for students. He clearly does not think that local government has to mean minimal government.
In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans -- P.F.R. (Parental and Family Responsibility), S.S.F. (Self-Sufficiency First), W.E.J.T. (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand for W.W., or Wisconsin Works). His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still being assembled.
He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more waivers. ("President Clinton is setting on it now.") His job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington: "There are 163 different kinds of rules and regulations dealing with school-to-work and job-ready money from the Federal Government. It's just plain idiotic."
Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally, since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed to term limits: "If you have people dumb enough to keep running for office, like me, you should let the people decide."
Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a traffic jam of election ballots. In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters' choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco, there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure (Proposition 73) outlawing it.
Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in 20 states. The referendum, too, is becoming more important, as Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic bad thing (the Federal Government). Local government can be improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything in between.
Governor Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget submitted by the Legislature. He has used the line-item veto more than 1,500 times.
Advocates of direct democracy, like Robert Wiebe, the political historian and theorist, oppose "government by experts," and Thompson sometimes makes fun of Washington "know-it-alls" who could not pass his "Elroy test" (what his little hometown knows is good for it). But Thompson also boasts of his reliance on experts, called in from all quarters to help him with planning. One of those experts, Lawrence Mead, wants to make welfare "the new paternalism," frankly telling people what is good for them. Temperamentally, Thompson is inclined to such hectoring certitude, despite his populist campaign rhetoric.
I recently followed Thompson, who was out to greet some constituents at the state environmental center. With men, he has some of Mario Cuomo's locker-room bluster. ("Don't be a wimp.") With women, he is a palsy chin-chucker. Despite the fact that both his parent were teachers and his wife still is (sixth grade in Elroy), he uses what must pass as "street talk" in rural Wisconsin -- "setting" for sitting, "oncommon" for uncommon, "secatary" for secretary.
He presents himself as embattled and with few allies: "I'm the only one still talking devolution." The Republican Congress is "as bad as the President." He feels that he has the spirit of Fighting Bob La Follette, the Wisconsin progressive -- except that La Follette went after big business and Thompson is a sworn foe of big government (at least in Washington). If one of Thompson's projects fails, he wants us to believe, it will be because of his encirclement by foes.
To get a "top down" view of the states' new activism, I interviewed President Clinton in April. He had just come in from a Rose Garden announcement of his education program. Clinton, the policy wonk, was eager to talk governmental relations even when aides were trying to move him to the next event. He finds the states'-rights activism a healthy development.
"What the states did in assuming greater responsibilities was mostly positive -- in education, in taking advantage of the opportunity Congress gave them to be more active in covering more children under child health programs. What my Administration tried to do was, basically, to emphasize two things -- No. 1, states as laboratories of democracy, principally in education, health care and welfare reform; and secondly, actually reduce the aggregate volume of regulations on them in areas where I thought there was too much micromanagement."
Thompson would clearly not see this waiving of authority as sufficient. He would like even less Clinton's caveat that, in giving up some power to the states, the Federal Government was freed to do new things. "We have been more active in some areas than the Federal Government traditionally has been -- in education, in wiring of schools and in trying to actually help them hire teachers to lower class size, the way we broke new ground by helping local law enforcement hire new officers." In short, Clinton does not see the states shoving the Federal Government off the scene but interacting with it in new ways.
Clinton is critical of the Supreme Court's tendency to exclude Washington from state-level activity, going beyond what Clinton praises as "basically a pragmatic reallocation of power between the states and the Federal Government over the last 20 years." He is especially upset by the Supreme Court's Brady Bill decision, "the most troubling of all because it said we couldn't even ask the local law-enforcement officials to do a minor ministerial job" of running background checks on gun purchasers.
On the other hand, Clinton takes a surprisingly benign view of state initiatives that express popular feeling rather than court-imposed mandates: "I don't agree with a lot of those votes, but I think they're votes that people have the right to make as long as they don't contravene a Federal statute or the Constitution.
"Usually there is a legitimate concern that these referenda are designed to address. Either representative government is going to have to move quickly into the breach when one of these proposals is on the ballot, so that it is not necessary by election time, or the progressive populists are going to have to put their own counter-proposals on the ballot. I don't think you can stop this movement any time soon when people want to have a more direct say on public issues."
We can see, by counterpointing the remarks of the Governor and the President, that there is little prospect of agreement in detail on the future of states' rights. The President is well disposed toward ballot initiatives, the most direct form of democracy. Governor Thompson is uneasy about uncoordinated proposals that might intrude on his master strategy. Though he once proposed introducing the initiative into the Wisconsin Constitution, that was when he was a young legislator. Now, he says, he is not interested in raising that issue.
Yet as a 10th Amendment fundamentalist, Thompson welcomes the Court's new interest in states' rights -- while the President resists any effort to break up the partnership. The place where this disagreement causes a head-on collision is the devolution of power over things like welfare. Thompson thinks Washington has been too slow and niggardly in turning over money. Clinton's liberal critics, by contrast, think he was too quick to untie strings over welfare programs. The President himself considered the Republican bill he signed too sweeping on some matters, but feels he remedied that by restoring food stamps and child-care provisions.
I asked him if he thinks that state welfare programs, spotty in their success even during a prosperous time, will stand up when economic reverses come. "Absolutely, as long as we keep the fundamental protection for children. We had, in my view, state-by-state settling of reimbursement for welfare families anyway.
"Before I signed the welfare bill, the reimbursement schedule for a family of three on welfare went from a low of $185 in Mississippi and Texas to a high of $660 in Vermont, and most states had welfare payments that were lower in real dollar terms, considerably lower, than they had been in the early 70's, because they had not kept up with inflation. So the Congress, long before I came along, had de facto ceded the monthly payments to the states anyway. Now the states are responsible.
"In the old days, nobody had to take responsibility for the welfare of the family and of the children, or whether there was a work-based program. Everybody could always kick the responsibility around. They could say that 'in our state the Federal Government has all these rules -- and, oh, by the way, it's operated by the county.' I think that locating responsibility and fixing it with the states will be more positive than negative."
It is here that Thompson gets heated in his comments on the President. "President Clinton has done everything he possibly can to stymie what we're trying to do in Wisconsin." He has words just as harsh for Donna Shalala of Health and Human Services. "I could get matching grants" for new programs, Thompson complains, but the Govenment will not turn over the money he feels he needs. On this point Thompson will get no help from the Federal courts. They have repeatedly ruled that states have to observe Federal conditions if they accept Federal money.
Thompson desperately needs Federal money. As he readily admits, Workfare, at least at the outset and for some time to come, is more costly than welfare. To train people for work, to deal with obstacles to work (alcohol, drugs, mental problems), to find jobs, to motivate employers, to offer child care for those going to work, to provide health insurance -- all this is not only expensive in itself but also has to be closely monitored. That is why the per-person yearly cost for people on welfare has gone up under Thompson, from $9,000 to $15,000.
Thompson's programs bring back the resented "social worker," who was an irritant under the old paternalism. His Learnfare program, for instance, was meant to dock welfare payments to any family whose child was not attending school. This involved keeping accurate truancy records, comparing them with welfare payments and weighing any alleviating circumstances (illness, transportation problems, children no longer living with their families, etc.). According to Pamela Fendt, a policy analyst at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee's Center for Economic Development, Learnfare saved $3 million in welfare payments but cost $14 million.
The expenses of Workfare exert tremendous pressure on the system to remove people from the program, one way or another. That is why Governor Thompson has tried to reach job-placement goals faster than required by Federal rules. One way to remove people from the rolls is simply to declare them ineligible. In Wisconsin, as in other states, many of those declared ineligible were reinstated on appeal. In Wisconsin, as in other states, the numbers going off welfare are not matched with reported jobs and income. Marcus White, associate director for the Interfaith Conference of Greater Milwaukee, says that there has been a quantum leap in the people showing up at Milwaukee shelters and soup kitchens, suggesting that not everyone disappearing from the welfare rolls is getting work.
So far, with the help of a booming economy in Wisconsin, the Governor has kept scrambling ahead of any clear signs of failure. When I suggest that Federal oversight might be justified by less commendable showings in other states, he is dismissive. "They're always saying that, that the states were going to be having a race to the bottom. I told them: 'You're wrong. That may have happened in the 40's and 50's. But right now you've got governors who are so darn competitive. They don't want to read that they're not taking care of the poor, and they're not going to let a governor in an adjoining state get ahead of them. We're very competitive."'
But Gov. Phil Batt of Idaho is not, apparently, feeling any competitive pressures. His state has cut welfare rolls by 77 percent, belying President Clinton's claim that disparities will be less acute under the new system. Idaho, which has the highest incidence of child abuse in the nation, spends $17 per capita for child welfare, as opposed to $99.30 in New York.
Peter Edelman, who resigned from the Department of Health and Human Services to protest Clinton's signing of the 1996 welfare bill, has kept a close eye on subsequent developments in the states. "There are some bright spots," he says. "There are some good states -- Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Oregon. But there are some very bad states -- Idaho, Mississippi, Georgia -- and some states, like Pennsylvania, are not doing much. In California, the Governor proposed a bad plan that the Legislature blocked."
Governor Thompson claims that the states are sure to do things better than the Federal Government, since they are closer to the peoples' needs and wants. "The new ideas are coming from the governors, and when you have that clash of ideas, you're going to bring out the best in education or in government."
When I suggest that not all the ideas coming from the states are great ones, he is quick, as ever, to the challenge: "Tell me some that aren't." I name term limits, three-strikes, anti-immigration measures, anti-gay measures. "You're right," he says. "I'll grant you there are some examples. But tell me some things in Wisconsin you don't like."
Thompson believes that the government closest to the people is the best government, which many people take to be a truism of democracy. Alexis de Tocqueville, during his 1831 visit to America, noted that "the Federal Government scarcely ever interferes in any but foreign affairs; and the governments of the states in reality direct society in America." The result, according to Tocqueville, was a "tyranny of the majority," by which local prejudice and conformity received no outside challenge.
It is the same complaint Madison had against the states' autonomy under the Articles of Confederation. The people were, in effect, the judges in their own cause -- which always leads to skewed judgments. John Jay, arguing in "The Federalist" for a larger union, said that the people least likely to make wise policy about Native Americans were those in the friction of greatest proximity to them. It is the same lesson we learned, in this century, from the assertions of Southern leaders that they best understood blacks.
Though popular sentiment must be expressed in popular government, it is clear that some kinds of dispute need impartial arbiters. The effort of some states to deny education to the children of illegal immigrants, or legal rights to homosexuals, or organization to unions, shows that popular sentiment can be harsh with unpopular people.
Actually, there is no danger of returning to the Jacksonian days of independent states. Even if you remove the Federal Government from the scene, other national organizations cut across state lines and have to be addressed in a national way.
When I asked Governor Thompson why he did not start his new educational programs in the public schools, he said the teachers' union was too powerful. "If I wanted to hire you from Northwestern to teach in the public schools, I could not give you a contract. The union has to decide what you can teach and where. You might end up teaching music in an out-of-the-way school." Even allowing for hyperbole, teachers' unions are national organizations that can be hard to deal with on the state level.
The best proof of the states' vulnerability to national forces is the flow of outside money and influence into the local arena. When Maine put up its referendum to remove a gay rights law, religious organizations sent in money for ads and teams of "ex-gays" traveled there to support the measure. At an advanced level of communications and transportation, and with the complex organization of religious, ideological and educational enterprises, a return to the independent states of Jackson's time is impossible. To deal with national organizations, whether corporations or unions, philanthropies or crime syndicates, the states are often going to need help from the national Government.
President Clinton ended our interview by noticing how the hard line between domestic and foreign policy is being dissolved. There is a parallel softening of the division between state and national life, not just in government but in every sphere. This does not mean that states are not better at handling some things or at conducting experiments not easily tried on a national scale. There will be, as Clinton says, new kinds of interaction, dialogue and dispute. All that is healthy. But a 10th Amendment fundamentalism that looks back to the muscular states of the Jacksonian era is, by now, an exercise in nostalgia for "good old days" that were not all that good.

HEADLINE: Through the Lenses of the Connecticut Postcard Man

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
FOR nearly half a century, Clifford Scofield has been recording the beauty of his adopted state, Connecticut -- its churches, its beaches, its parks and forests, its monuments, its dogwood trees that burst into color in the spring and its maple trees, the leaves of which die spectacularly in the fall.
Cities, he tries to mostly ignore. They are too dirty and noisy, he says. And they change too much, and too fast. For example, The New Haven Register recently disclosed that the Liberty Belle, a popular cruise ship in the city's harbor for more than two decades, had sailed away to Bangor, Me., presumably for forever. Mr. Scofield is left with many photograph mementoes of the Liberty Belle, now gone. 
 Mr. Scofield is Connecticut's "Postcard Man," a professional photographer who specializes in postcards and the dean of such photographers in the state, all five of them, and probably in the entire nation. After all, how many postcard photographers, or any commercial photographers for that matter, are still active in business in their ninth decade?
Clifford Scofield is 93. He will reach 94 in August, not that another birthday will alter his thinking about retirement. "I don't know what retired means," he says. "What is it, when you just do nothing?" It is not really a question.
He does not delude himself that he is as quick as when he was, say, in his 70's, or 80's. Early in this decade, in a note to some of his customers, he said he had been enjoying the fun, and picture possibilities, of a hot air balloon, a speedboat on the Hudson River and a tube on the Farmington River.
But, he wrote, he was sorry he had to give up skiing. He had dropped that from his itinerary when he was 72.
Now a widower, he has also quit driving because his eyes have gone back on him a bit. He has kept his car, though, depending on friends to ferry him about on business or on pleasure.
The business is supplying his postcards to about two dozen retail outlets -- general stores, gift shops and drug stores -- in the Upper Housatonic Valley and the Lower Connecticut River Valley. The pleasure includes attending all the big camera shows in the state, buying some more cameras and selling some from his collection, which dates back to the first quarter of this century, huge boxy affairs that required flash powder for lighting and were an adventure to operate.
Mr. Scofield is a product of the economics that shaped the United States, and the rest of the world, for most of this century.
He was born in Brooklyn but grew up in Montreal where his father, an insurance underwriter, had been transferred. And one day, when he was 15, he discovered the joys of photography. He won a folding camera for selling the most tickets at a bazaar. He can recall instantly both who held the bazaar and what the camera was. The sponsor was the Daughters of the British Empire. "It was an organization like the D.A.R. here." The camera was a Model IA Kodak Jr.
Eventually he wore out the camera but later bought another one. He still has it.
Photography was just a hobby at first. He went to McGill University in Montreal and then, after his father was transferred back to New York, attended Columbia University and City College of New York. His goal was the common American dream of the time: a good job with a good company.
In 1926, that seemed to be settled. He was hired by Bell Laboratories, the research arm of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, one of the great rocks of American business.
Five years later, the dream dissolved. A.T.&T. proved as vulnerable as any other corporations to The Great Depression. Bell Labs laid off 2,000 of its 5,500 workers and Clifford Scofield was one of them. He had to find something else to do in a time of bread lines and soup kitchens. He turned to his first love, photography.
"I had to borrow money to get film and I started to do weddings and commercial pictures, even for the W.P.A." W.P.A. was the Works Progress Administration, one of the agencies dreamed up by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to get men back to work. Mr. Scofield still talks of the President -- he calls him "Mr. Roosevelt" -- with some awe, even though, he adds, he has never been a Democrat.
And his new career worked out. In the early 1950's he expanded it into postcards. It was a home industry that would never make him rich, he knew that, but it was honest and enjoyable. He and his wife, Jeanette, brought up a son and daughter on postcards.
Over the years, Mrs. Scofield learned to live in a house in Cheshire that was also a workplace: a photo lab in the basement, a working office and storage place for thousands of cards on the second floor. She would warn visitors that they went upstairs at their peril, that it was a real mess there.
She died seven years ago. The mess remains. Clifford Scofield was up there one recent day, sorting through stacks and boxes of postcards here, there and everywhere. He estimated that there were maybe 65,000 cards within grabbing range, give or take. Also around were a sufficient number of the business cards that might best explain Mr. Scofield.
"Clifford Scofield Color Productions," is on one side of one card. On the flip side is a Halloween pumpkin sticking out a red pepper tongue. He took the picture. He liked it. So why not use it?

HEADLINE: Patent Weaknesses

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Keep a Strong Patent System" (Viewpoint, June 7), in which Richard C. Hsu and Jeffrey D. Tekanic said the cost of patent litigation was a small price to pay for the benefits of the United States patent process: 
 Unfortunately, our country does not have a strong patent system, and the litigation explosion to which Mr. Hsu and Mr. Tekanic referred is instead a symptom of its weakness.
The patent system is characterized by low standards for gaining patents, unnecessary uncertainty over the scope and validity of patents, and damage awards that are often excessive. The effect is to increase the cost and risk of innovation in our country.
The lower standards mean that more patents are being obtained, even for trivial ideas. This means that innovators must worry more about infringing others' patents when commercializing innovations and must seek more patents on their work to protect their own rights. That means unnecessary costs.
The uncertainty of the process is a profound failing of the patent system. After all, the first function of any legal regime is to inform those affected by it of their rights and duties so they can act accordingly.
Finally, excessive damage awards, which give patent holders more in damages than they would have made had there been no infringement, are an incentive to sue rather than settle. And they offer a strong disincentive for innovators, who do not know if their innovations will run afoul of others' patents and are unwilling to run the risk of excessive, possibly crippling damages.
I was the general counsel for Eastman Kodak during its patent litigation with Polaroid, and that case illustrated many problems with our patent system. Kodak set out to create instant photography products that did not infringe the patents of others, including Polaroid, and believed it had done so, based on the advice of its outside lawyers. Kodak's patent clearance process was characterized by a court as "a model for what the law requires," but it turned out to be wrong as to 7 of the 12 Polaroid patents in the litigation. Obviously, if the best a model process can do is 5 for 12, then the patent system has failed in its primary task of informing those affected by it of their rights and duties.
But interestingly enough, the $873 million judgment, by eliminating uncertainty, resulted in a $795 million increase in the market value of Kodak stock. Uncertainty does have its price!

HEADLINE: ART;
Exotic Accumulations in Miniature Spaces

BYLINE: By Roberta Smith 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE 16th- and 17th-century Dutch were probably not the first Westerners to be more interested in this world than the next, but they pursued that interest with unusual energy, openness and intelligence.
Their assured, enterprising curiosity is reflected in their advances in cartography, navigation, exploration, lens-cutting, medicine and science, and a bustling sea trade that sustained Amsterdam as a center of international commerce as well as learning. 
 It is also evident in their art, which built upon the observation and accuracy first formulated by Van Eyck and then Durer. With an alacrity suggesting that love of the world engenders love of self, Dutch artists pursued subjects among their immediate surroundings, painting Dutch men and women, their everyday lives and the Dutch landscape. They gave genre painting its first definition and painted so many depictions of objects that the term "stilleven" -- still life -- was coined.
Perhaps the most vivid reflection of this worldliness -- this inclusive embrace of knowledge, experience and beauty -- was the kunstkamer, or art cabinet, the often encyclopedic arrays of art, artifacts and natural specimens assembled by prosperous Dutch or Flemish burghers.
So argues "A Collector's Cabinet," a pocket-size show at the National Gallery of Art. A summer hit now extended to Nov. 1, it qualifies as a blockbuster in a teapot.
"A Collector's Cabinet," organized by Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., the museum's curator of northern Baroque painting, loosely re-creates an eclectic, 17th-century kunstkamer. In all, 180 artworks have been shoehorned into three galleries with a combined area of less than 800 square feet.
The show features walls double- and triple-hung with smallish to tiny oil paintings, mostly Dutch, Flemish and Italian. Handsome built-in vitrines brim with table-top sculptures, decorative objects, Roman coins, jewelry, Chinese lacquers, prints, illustrated books, exotic shells, botanical and zoological drawings, musical instruments, the occasional map, an elephant's tooth and scientific instruments like microscopes, telescopes, globes and a protractor. The kunstkamer was multicultural and multimedia before the fact.
The installation gives claustrophobia a good name, or at least distracts effectively from its anxieties. The slightest shift of the eyes causes images and objects to group and regroup according to subject, style, form or material and creates a shifting flow of thoughts and perceptions.
The fascination with nature's exotica takes different forms. In one vitrine, sea coral, highly prized, appears in its natural state, as an impressive bright-red trident. A nearly identical sprig commands the center of a beautiful, kunstkamer-like still life (by Jacques Linard, a French artist) of shells. A third bit of coral serves as the stem of a finely wrought silver spoon.
In other instances, rare natural forms inspired ostentatious artifice. With the addition of a gilded silver head, wings and feet, an ostrich egg becomes a sculpture of the bird itself (also an ewer). Similarly, a large nautilus becomes a snail when supplemented with a graceful head, rippling foot and tiny fairy astride its back. Above these hang images of unaugmented natural wonders: prints of a rhinoceros and a pig with six legs, both by Durer.
For the most part, the juxtapositions of paintings make the most interesting points, dramatizing the range of realist styles and subjects. After regarding the quiet precision of Pieter Jansz Saenredam's pale interior of a vaulting church nave, from around 1632, the eye is drawn across the way to the serenity and radiance of Jan Olis's "Interior With Young Men Playing Tric-Trac," a tavern scene in whites and creams from around 1632. On the intervening wall, Adriaen Brouwer's "Youth Making a Face" (1632-35) gives a grittier picture of tavern life, as does a tiny gray scene (around 1635) that includes a man relieving himself, this one by David Teniers the Younger, who was influenced by Brouwer.
Amid these different realist styles, and flanked in one instance by two small turbulent Rembrandts, Johannes Vermeer's "Woman Holding a Balance" and "Girl With a Red Hat" communicate a startling modernity -- an economy of form, purity of color and odd flatness that border on the abstract. Vermeer seems almost as removed from the painting of his time as that painting was from the art of the Italian Renaissance, with its idealized treatments of biblical and classical subjects. When Roelandt Savery paints his 1624 image of the Holy Family resting on the Flight Into Egypt, they appear deep in the background of a scene filled with farmers and cattle.
It seems appropriate that the galleries holding this show aren't much bigger than a small one-bedroom apartment. For despite its vivid glimpse of a distant time, place and mind-set, it is not alien. The Dutch or Flemish kunstkamer may be ground zero for a number of familiar phenomena: the private art collection, for one. Neither members of royalty nor the clergy, the Dutch in particular were the first bourgeois art collectors in the West, habitually displaying art in less than palatial homes and thereby encouraging the production of small objects and paintings.
In their ostentation, some of these objects contain hints of bric-a-brac to come and might even qualify as pre-industrial kitsch, despite the uniqueness, consummate craft and high production values.
But the kunstkamer's density also resonates with the chock-a-block displays found throughout the art world these days. In a time as modest as ours can sometimes be, young artists often sneak up on large scale by massing together lots of little things -- small paintings, drawings, photographs, found objects.
OTHER echoes can be found in some recent high-density museum exhibitions organized by noncurators looking to take liberties with the whole exhibition concept. One thinks of the cheek-by-jowl display of portraits that the painter Chuck Close organized, with Kirk Varnedoe, in a small gallery at the Museum of Modern Art in 1991; of the sculptor Arman's dense installation of works from his collection of African art at the Museum of African Art in SoHo last fall, and of "A/Drift," a wild mix of contemporary art and artifacts (record albums, rock posters, T-shirts and music videos) organized in 1996 by the critic Joshua Decter at the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. And at the moment, there's "Bathroom" at the Thomas Healy Gallery in Chelsea, one of many thematic compendiums presented by New York art galleries every season.
The National Gallery's exhibition returns to the moment when the experience of art was, in effect, privatized by successful commoners with uncommon amounts of disposable income. Their nonhierarchical collections -- the kunstkamer theory of relativity? -- made these ensembles machines for seeing, like the lenses and microscopes they sometimes included, and exemplars of a multicultural connoisseurship whose relevance endures.

Discovering a New Way of Dining Out

BYLINE: By FRAN SCHUMER 

 BODY:
TUESDAY night I ate steak au poivre at Pierre's; Wednesday at noon I'm eating chicken fingers and frozen fries with my children on their school's annual retreat at Camp Fairview in Stillwater. Why me, I wonder as they pass the Day Glo-pink punch in my direction.
Every year, my children's school, like about 150 others in New Jersey, spends two days at the camp, a beautiful, if somewhat rustic, facility run by the Y.M.C.A. The grounds, in southwestern Sussex County, are adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area and the Appalachian Trail -- if those names mean anything to you. To me, they mean bugs, insect repellent and crunchy mattresses, not to mention -- and as a restaurant reviewer, how could I not? -- bad food. What am I doing here? 
 My children and their school are here to learn about the environment; I'm here because my ex-scout husband, who normally attends these nature fests, couldn't get away this year. I stash imported tea bags and a few premium navel oranges from King's in the trunk and off we go.
My son, a third grader, takes the bus but my daughter, a second grader, accompanies me in the car. The purpose of this two-and-a-half-day adventure is not only for the parents, teachers and children from our small, cooperative school to bond with each other, but also for all of us to bond with nature. I'm not sure that what my daughter and I are doing in the car is bonding, but at least we talk.
Q. "Mom, are we there yet?"
A. "Almost," I answer, more or less honestly, depending on whether we are in the Caldwells or Sparta.
About a half-hour later, my cellular telephone stops working. Welcome to Camp Fairview. Its 600 acres of woodlands, fields and streams are more beautiful than I expected, the Kittatinny Mountains looming blue and hazy in the distance. By the time we settle into our cabin, which is rustic but clean, it's noon. In addition to chicken fingers and fries, the meal consists of iceberg lettuce and a dressing that one teacher dubs Agent Orange. Dare I ask for a drizzle of the Paul Newman Balsamic Vinegar Dressing that another retrieves from her backpack? Fortunately, there isn't time to ruminate, let alone finish my salad.
The first activity on the agenda is a hike. The guide points out interesting facts of nature that neither my daughter nor I absorb. She's too busy trailing an older student whom she idolizes, and I'm too busy worrying what her infatuation means about her self-esteem. My decision to separate her from her friend proves fatal. She cries over the next half mile, past a fairy-like patch of pine trees planted by unemployed workers during the Great Depression, while I try to dig myself out of my lesser one. When she joins her friend back at the cabin, I don't know which of us is more relieved.
In swimsuits, we join my son and the rest of our school by the lake. The children are asked to pair off, and now it's my son's turn to suffer: the person he asks to be his buddy declines and rushes off with someone else. Between that moment and the one in which he does find a companion, I reach my emotional nadir. It is all too much for me to tolerate, this parent-teacher-student bonding. Better to hide myself in my kitchen or at my computer, where I can at least imagine that the hours my children spend away from me are perfect.
Again, however, I am saved and not by my usual 4 P.M. cappuccino. My son and his friend press me into taking them out in a canoe, which I am delighted to discover I remember how to paddle. I missed my favorite aerobics classes by being on this outing, but paddling, I realize, strengthens my biceps and under more meaningful conditions: with my children and on a beautiful lake. Not for the first time, going with the flow, which I always resist, restores me. Dinner is at an unfashionably early 5:30 P.M., but I am starving and even the runny lasagna tastes good. What a novel idea: to eat because food is there and you're hungry.
In the time that remains, I crochet, become interested in the novel I started reading last fall and make a new friend. The highlight in terms of food is the turkey and canned cranberry sauce at our final supper. All around me, people complain, but by then it is hopeless: not only do I fall in love with the turkey, I fall in love with the idea of food being kept in its proper perspective.
That night, the children put on a talent show in the fading light of the campfire. A few weeks earlier, I ate passion fruit chocolate ganache at the Short Hills Hilton and here I lick marshmallow off my fingers.
We have the option of leaving the next day before lunch, which I decline. "Hey, are you going to review the food here?" a parent asks after frozen pizza.
No, but if I were, I'd give it an A plus.

HEADLINE: Crusade to Save the Chestnut

BYLINE: By ANDREA ZIMMERMANN 

 BODY:
IT has all the elements of a modern crime novel -- a trail of death from Maine to Georgia, rich perpetrators, DNA clues and the Feds lingering in the shadows. But in fact, it is a century-old mystery that Sandra Anagnostakis, a scientist at the Agricultural Experiment Station, is slowly unraveling in the laboratory and forests. It is the case of the disappearing chestnut trees.
The American chestnut once dominated forests as a 70- to 100-foot canopy tree and provided about half of North America's native hardwood. In the 1880's, however, imported Japanese chestnuts brought in a killer fungus. Nurseries propagated the species and sold the trees through mail order. Pockets of affluent communities soon found their native American chestnuts developing orange cankers. Insects and migratory birds did the rest, transmitting the fungal spores through the country. The blight wiped out the old stands of American chestnuts and, until recently, had the species locked in an interrupted cycle of sprouting and dying. 
 "I know what we're up against. There are massive amounts of fungus out there," says Dr. Anagnostakis, who has spent the past 30 years working on the problem. She identified and has introduced a biological control that prevents the fungus from killing trees, and continues the chestnut cross-breeding project begun by Dr. Arthur Graves in Connecticut in the 1930's.
This time of year, the mycologist says, she feels a little like a bee because she spends hours scouting for flowers in the chestnut orchard at the experiment station's Lockwood Farm in Hamden. "It's pollinating season. Every Fourth of July weekend, when most people are having barbecues, I'm out here pollinating chestnuts." Flowers on selected trees are pollinated, then isolated with bags which remain until nuts are harvested in the fall. The nuts have a requisite cold treatment in a refrigerator, start germinating and are planted in the spring.
The goal of cross-breeding is to produce two types of chestnuts resistant to blight: A splaying orchard tree with tasty nuts, and a tall timber tree that looks like an American chestnut but has as much resistance as Asian chestnuts.
"Anybody who's going to work on trees better be patient," Dr. Anagnostakis notes. "One generation -- from seed to the next seed -- is 10 years."
This year, Dr. Anagnostakis will offer free to nurseries a cultivar, Little Giant, that she developed for its backyard size and good nuts. And, she said, she is very close to producing a timber tree that can compete in the forest.
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has the largest collection of species and hybrids of chestnuts in the world, including specimens from Russia, China, Japan, Turkey and Europe, all in Hamden and all closely documented. Dr. Anagnostakis sighs when she realizes another small metal identification tag has disappeared off the trunk of a tree. "Its the crows," she explains. "They like the shiny tags."
Blight resistant hybrids are only a partial solution to the problem, she says, because blight fungus could mutate to overcome the resistance gene in a hybrid. The fungus itself, therefore is her target.
At one time, farmers attempted to control the blight by clearing and burning around affected orchards or by spraying trees with a copper fungicide, a technique used in vineyards today to protect the fruit from disease. "The state of Pennsylvania spent a great deal of money because Pennsylvania had a lot of orchards," said Dr. Anagnostakis. "It looked as thought it would kill everything and it did. It was clear for a long time that chemicals were not going to be effective against chestnut blight."
In 1972, Dr. Anagnostakis received samples of diseased chestnut fungus from France. She found the fungus had a virus -- a natural biological control. Although the virus was not lethal, it prevented the fungus from penetrating the chestnut stem and killing the tree; the tree could then produce thick tissue to wall-off the canker. She found when a strain of fungus with a susceptible chestnut tree was inoculated with the viral parasite, the virus could fuse with a killer canker and render it benign.
Seventy American chestnut seedlings were planted at Lockwood Farm in 1976. For the next five years, every canker was treated with the viral agent; no treatment has been administered since 1981. Many of the trees have thrived.
It takes a sharp eye to detect a medallion of blight fungus (insects feed on the cankers, virtually obliterating the fungus' tell-tale orange coloration). But areas where the trees have been treated are difficult to miss -- swollen rings and knots surround dead bark where the canker attacked. One tree at the Hamden site looks as if it had been roto-tilled along 20 feet of bark and then healed over. It may not be beautiful, but the tree is alive and well.
Samples of what appear to be killer cankers at the farm will be studied to see if a virus is present , which virus, and how much of it. "Since this is such a successful orchard, it would be nice to know what we did right," says Dr. Anagnostakis, who remains undaunted by all the questions.
Although natural hypovirulent strains, so named for their relatively benign nature, were effective in an orchard, they were less so in the forest where trees are competing for light, moisture and nutrients. Even after inoculation the blight fungus produced spores that did not contain the virus so infection of untended trees continued. This pushed research to the molecular level.
Donald Nuss at the University of Maryland copied the virus genes and attached them to the genes of the fungus, making fungal strains that were permanently hypovirulent. The spores made by these fungal strains contained the virus so, if compatible with local fungi, the two could fuse and the virus would be passed along, inhibiting the blight.
Drs. Nuss and Anagnostakis then tested the genetically engineered control in the lab and greenhouse to see if it would cause any adverse affects if used in the environment; they found no evidence of harm to other life forms.
In 1994, the Federal and Connecticut regulatory commissions allowed the genetically engineered, biological control to be released into the environment -- the first time such an experiment had been sanctioned in this country. Each year inspectors accompany Dr. Anagnostakis into the field to check on her work.
The initial test site was four acres in the Housatonic State Forest in Sharon. Dr. Anagnostakis and her assistants mapped every American chestnut one inch or more in diameter on the plot. In order to do a scientific evaluation, the mycologist needed to track cankers that appeared at the same time. So she actually inoculated the trees with the killing strain of fungus and then treated one in each pair of trees; no further applications of hypovirulent will be made at the site. Last year, she sampled 81 natural cankers from the plot and found just one had the new recombinant hypovirulent strain.
Again, patience. "That's not bad. It meant it was there," says Dr. Anagnostakis. "I really think we'll start seeing it spread. The only way to keep track is with the human eye; there are no machines that can do this. An old sage said, 'You can see a lot by looking.' I saw two insects I didn't know existed -- quarter-inch-long weevils -- that are carrying the killer and recombinant hypovirulent fungus. It clearly feeds on the chestnut blight fungus. I've talked to an entomologist about raising and releasing them. . . . "
Another method of spreading the biological control is being tested in a timbered and cleared 400-by-400-foot plot in the Meshomasic State Forest, an area where chestnut trees once flourished.
Last year, Drs. Nuss and Anagnostakis sprayed the trunk of every American chestnut sprout with either water (the control plot) or hypovirulent spore mixture made from the most common fungal strains in that area. The process will be repeated at least twice a year for four years. Any competing vegetation will be cut down. The scientists hope to replace the population of killing chestnut blight with the benign form, and are anxious to see if it will spread beyond the test site into the forest.
"By repeatedly putting out massive amounts of hypovirulent strains there will be a lot of hypovirulent spores available," says Dr. Anagnostakis. "Can we make a difference? I don't know. We can't spray it from airplanes; imagine having to grow that much fungus! What I really want is for it to spread by itself."
By learning about and manipulating the chestnut blight system of host-pathogen-parasite, scientists have developed one of the better models for studying plant diseases, says Dr. Anagnostakis. They now have a "fairly good" molecular map of the chestnut tree, along with DNA analysis that might identify blight-resistant genes.
"The science is fascinating," says Dr. Anagnostakis, "but I really want to save the chestnut trees." There are many good economic reasons to restore the chestnut tree -- as a valuable timber crop or to control the blight on orchard cultivars. But the main value is to increase diversity of the forest. Improving diversity is intrinsically a good thing, a healthy thing."

HEADLINE: Who Are We? A Book of Answers

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE latest edition of Westchester's Databook is full of useful information, including facts not only about the county's government, its labor force, its infrastructure and taxes but also about many little-known and sometimes colorful statistical details.
For example, men outnumber women until age 20, according to the Databook, making the county an auspicious place for young women to meet mates. 
 And one does not have to go to the northern reaches of the county to find wooded areas and fresh air. Open space in Westchester exists where one might least expect it: the town of Mount Pleasant in the middle of the county and Dobbs Ferry, a densely settled village to the south. Those spots have the highest proportion of open space -- 43.5 percent and 41.7 percent, respectively. By contrast, Buchanan, a village in the mostly rural northern section, has the least amount -- 3.5 percent.
More than offering data of interest only to statisticians, actuaries and developers, the Databook is aimed at a wide variety of readers. As its authors at the county's Planning Department said recently, it is a lively resource for anyone who wants to know more about Westchester and how it evolved from 1524 -- when Giovanni Verrazano, the first explorer arrived -- to the present, two years before the turn of the millennium, with 893,412 residents and an average household income of $61,861.
"Not just a dust collector or doorstop, it offers a real snapshot of Westchester at any one time, a profile," said Noreen L. Preston, a Planning Department economist and editor of the 250-page Databook, one of the largest single sources of information about the county.
The book offers information on population dynamics -- breakdowns by age, sex and race -- incorporating the latest estimates from the United States Census Bureau; housing statistics with figures documenting the last few years' turnaround in the residential real estate market and details on female- and minority-owned companies.
Also, new median-income estimates and cost-of-living information are included, along with facts about transportation, education, child care, taxes, hospitals, recreation and major job-generating industries.
The Databook weaves into the current statistics a history of the county, observing, for example, that it was not until 80 years after the first explorer that Henry Hudson sailed up the river now named for him and began the often bloody process that left the indigenous population, the Algonquian Indians, without a home.
Soon after, Westchester became what it has continued to be -- a wealthy and predominantly white county. By 1775, the Indians were significantly reduced in numbers, and the newly settled area became the richest, most populous county in the New York Colony.
"Even after the peace treaties -- all primarily advantageous to the newcomers -- were signed, injuries from land battles and diseases brought by the Europeans continued to plague and decimate the Native Americans who eventually disappeared entirely from the area," a section of the Databook reads.
Today, the still mostly white and prosperous Westchester County ranks second in per capita income -- $40,696 -- among counties in the state, with only Manhattan (New York County) surpassing it at $58,096. Among all counties in the United States, Westchester ranks sixth, being 75 percent wealthier than the national average in per capita income. The Databook does not list which county is first in the country, but it is again New York County.
By contrast, Nassau showed a $36,609 per capita income in 1995, Rockland, $30,698 and Putnam, $28,914. For Fairfield County, average per capita income at $42,800, the third highest in the country, was higher than Westchester's, while for Bergen and Passaic in New Jersey it was lower -- at $39,014 and $24,943, respectively.
The richest municipality in Westchester as of 1989 -- the most recent year for which figures are available -- is Scarsdale, with an average per capita income of $59,868.
The poorest municipality is Mount Vernon at $15,835 in 1989.
The average wage in the county in 1996 was $38,237 (somewhat above the state average of $36,816), with the highest average salaries ($64,470) being paid in the manufacturing sector and the lowest average annual salaries ($31,346) being paid in service industries.
Media directors and vice presidents of financial institutions are the highest wage earners in Westchester -- $1,923 a week on average; cashiers, kitchen workers and school crossing guards earn among the least -- less than $200 a week.
The racial and ethnic composition of the county has been steadily shifting, according to the Databook -- with whites still accounting for almost 80 percent of the population in 1996, but blacks making up 15 percent, compared with 13 percent in 1990, and Asians accounting for 5 percent, up from 3.7 percent. Those of Hispanic origin, who can be of any race, accounted for 11.6 percent of the population in 1996, up from 9.9 percent in 1990.
"The population growth of recent years has been strongly affected by migration," the Databook says. "Westchester County is a multicultural community with a racial and ethnic composition not unlike that of the United States."
The original residents, American Indians, now account for 0.2 percent, with their numbers remaining stable in recent years. Of the total population, men outnumber women until age 20, after which the number of men diminishes. For example, in 1996, there were 24,795 women and girls in the 15-to-19 age group and 26,308 men and boys. Ms. Preston at the Planning Department could not say why that occurs in Westchester but not in many other localities. In the 20-to-24 age group, women outnumber men 25,496 to 24,880.
The county's population also continues to grow older, with the number of people 85 and older increasing to 11,928 in 1996 from 10,427 in 1990. By age 85, women outnumber men 11,928 to 4,399 or almost 3 to 1.
Household size continues to grow smaller in the county, down by 7.1 percent to 2.6 people in 1990 from 3.1 people in 1970. And the median price of a home as of 1997 was $300,000 and in 1987 it was $283,900.
Average rents range from $675 a month for a studio apartment to $1,625 a month for five bedrooms. But the range is wide, depending on location, with two bedrooms renting for $848 on average in Yonkers and $1,375 in Rye.
Under the category of business, there are 33 pages of tables, bar graphs and other charts detailing the county's economic growth. The Databook says Westchester's business sector consists of almost 30,000 companies or organizations, representing an expansion rate of 8.4 percent from 1985 to 1995.
"Downsizings, mergers and acquisitions since the late 1980's have changed the profile of many of Westchester's major employers in recent years," the Databook says. Now, 80 percent of establishments have fewer than 10 employees, and 90 percent employ fewer than 20. "Smaller businesses clearly have gained ground in the 1990's," Ms. Preston writes.
After several years of decline, Westchester's labor force has also been growing. The number of jobs in the county -- at 382,900 in 1996 -- has been increasing steadily since 1993, driven by high rates of growth in the health and social-services sector. More than one-third of the jobs are service positions, with about 10,000 new jobs available in health care alone. The high point for job numbers in Westchester occurred in 1988 with 410,000; the low point in 1993 with 375,000 jobs.
Under the category of transportation, the Databook lists express bus routes, Bee-Line feeder routes to train stations, shuttles that provide door-to-door service to corporate sites and airline information. It also includes a map of Interstate routes and parkways, commuter railroads and the Westchester County Airport in Harrison.
Looking ahead to business and infrastructure needs, the Department of Planning included in the Databook a map of telecommunications capabilities. From 1985 through 1996, $60 million was spent on expanding the fiber-optic infrastructure, the book says, with the largest center of corporate and business activity -- White Plains and Harrison -- showing the greatest concentrations of fiber-optic lines.
A section in the Databook on education includes a map of school districts, charts on enrollment and school expenditures, Scholastic Aptitude Scores by school district, the average level of education attained and lists of private schools, colleges and universities.
There are also maps of cultural sites, hotels, conference centers, parks and other recreational sites.
Copies of the Databook may be ordered for $50 from the Westchester County Department of Planning, 148 Martine Avenue, Room 432, White Plains, N.Y., 10601, or by calling 285-4400.

HEADLINE: New Transportation Chief Named

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
COUNTY EXECUTIVE Andrew J. Spano finally gave one County Legislator what he had been pushing for -- the appointment of a black person with the title of commissioner.
Marvin V. Church, who has served as a Deputy Commissioner of Transportation, was named Commissioner of Transportation to head the department that oversees the county's bus system, transit services for the disabled and the County Airport. Mr. Church will be paid $104,370 a year. 
 The appointment must be confirmed by the Board of Legislators, one of whose members, Clinton I. Young Jr., a Democrat from Yonkers, had been critical of what he saw as the lack of diversity in Mr. Spano's top appointments. Mr. Young contended that no blacks or people of Hispanic descent had been named to a commissioner's post.
Mr. Spano, also a Democrat, replied that it was just a matter of semantics, that there were two high-level blacks whose duties put them in Mr. Spano's cabinet even if their title was not commissioner. Indeed, in announcing Mr. Church's appointment, Mr. Spano called it the third cabinet-level position held by a black. (The others are Paula Redd Zeman, the county's Personnel Officer, and John S. Pritchard 3d, the county's Inspector General, a newly created position.)
Mr. Church has worked in various government jobs. A Republican, he had served as Gov. George E. Pataki's regional director with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Before that, he was appointed by then Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts as an Associate Commissioner of the Massachusetts State Highway Department.
Mr. Church replaces Eric B. Langeloh, who has held various high-level positions. Mr. Spano said Mr. Langeloh will remain with the county, working on special assignments.

HEADLINE: Revitalizing the Riverfront in Wilmington, Del.

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
MICHAEL S. PURZYCKI'S mandate is to focus on the future of this city's long-neglected Christina River waterfront. Yet the 52-year-old lawyer can't stop thinking about the past.
"There were 11,000 people building ships on the river at the height of World War II, and for some reason we've let that history evaporate," said Mr. Purzycki as he thumbed through 1943 employee newsletters from the Dravo Corporation's Wilmington shipyard. "There's not a lot of people around here anymore who could tell that story." 
 That slighting of the past is about to change. As head of the Riverfront Development Corporation -- a state-created organization charged with revitalizing the city's waterfront -- Mr. Purzycki intends to capitalize on the Christina's shipbuilding past.
The hope is that the area's industrial history will provide the kind of identity that will attract tourists to an exhibition hall, a catalogue-company outlet center, nightclubs, a riverfront promenade and restaurants now under development just south of the central business district.
Until recently the roughly 100 acres controlled by the development agency consisted largely of a smokestack graveyard filled with strange-looking vegetation and the ghosts of anonymous blue-collar workers whose pay records have turned up during building renovations.
But Mr. Purzycki believes that for a place to succeed it has to have a soul. "We don't want people to have that same empty feeling they have after a visit to a shopping mall," said Mr. Purzycki, whose agency has in two years spent more than $10 million in state money on the project.
He is keeping the six 50-foot cranes used in the construction of some 400 landing craft from 1941 to 1945. He also plans murals and monuments to commemorate famous ships built on the site and is considering using a film of the riverfront's war effort now in the Hagley Museum and Library here.
The cranes will loom over the 400,000-square-foot Ship Yard Shops outlet center, whose only announced participants so far are L. L. Bean and Coldwater Creek. The $36 million complex is a joint venture of the development agency, Ruth and Bill Wizner of the Tri-W Corporation in Nashville and Verino Pettinaro, a local developer who owns much of the undeveloped land along the river.
The Wizners were among the pioneers in the factory outlet concept, building centers in Hilton Head, S.C., and Nashville in the 70's. Work is now under way on the first phase of the center here -- about 20 shops in 100,000 square feet of space, which is expected to be completed by next March.
The centerpiece of the waterfront revival is the First USA Riverfront Arts Center, a 120,000-square-foot hall designed to hold so-called "blockbuster exhibits" -- shows with objects from the era depicted, but with an emphasis on storytelling. These shows are often snubbed by the traditional arts community.
Just months ago, the arts center was a dilapidated hulk that still held the gantry and rail tracks from its days as a landing-craft assembly plant. Now, the cavernous space has been carved into a hall designed to accommodate up to 1,000 people an hour when exhibits are being staged.
IT includes 25,000 square feet of galleries, a 6,000-square-foot gift shop and a 13,000-square-foot lobby. About $1 million was spent on finishing the lobby with such touches as a terrazzo floor featuring a compass rose design 40 feet in diameter.
To cover the cost of the $10 million conversion, First USA Bank, a leading credit-card bank based here, pledged $2.5 million over 10 years. The development corporation chipped in another $2.5 million, while the balance will be financed by Pettinaro Construction and the development agency.
To produce the shows, the development corporation signed a five-year contract with Broughton International Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla., which describes itself as a full-service exhibition company that conceptualizes the show, does the research, secures the art objects, hires the employees, installs the exhibit and runs the gift shop.
Broughton's first exhibit, called "Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia," will open Aug. 1 with roughly 700 objects from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the State Archives of the Russian Federation and the State Palace Museum in Tsarskoe Selo. The development agency expects it to draw at least 500,000 people from the region over its five-month run.
Because blockbuster exhibits can cost $5 million to $8 million to mount, the corporation has lent Broughton $2 million to cover initial costs. Recently, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., the state's largest private employer, agreed to become the show's primary sponsor with a $200,000 grant.
The development agency's loan to Broughton is to be repaid through ticket sales and gift-shop revenues. The deal was structured that way because Broughton was embroiled in controversy at its last job with the Florida International Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla.
The museum held three blockbuster shows -- including the one on Russian tsarist treasures that brought in more than 600,000 people -- but lost $11 million over three years. Some of the Florida community's officials were upset that the museum was losing money, while closely held Broughton appeared to be making money on the gift shop.
James Broughton, head of Broughton International and former creator of Memphis Wonders exhibit series, maintains that the huge losses resulted from the debt the museum incurred when it converted a department store for its arts center, not from its handling of the exhibits.
Mr. Purzycki said he had crafted a contract to avoid such problems, but he conceded that the development corporation could still end up losing money on the shows.
"I'm not going to whine if we lose a couple hundred thousand dollars," Mr. Purzycki said. "I see it as an investment in making this place flourish. We need a unique attraction to bring in people from the region. We can't just rely on locals to make this work,"
That is not the only difficulty Mr. Purzycki has had to overcome in carrying out his vision for the waterfront. Individual landowners on the river have driven hard bargains as the development agency has attempted to assemble land.
" We didn't steal anything," he said. "There's not a seller on the river that needs the money." What's more, some members of the City Council and Mayor James H. Sills Jr. grew critical of what has been perceived as the state's heavy hand in developing the waterfront, which is within the city limits. Mr. Sills charged that Gov. Thomas Carper was treating the riverfront as a personal fiefdom by not including city officials and residents as partners.
Nevertheless, Mr. Sills vetoed a bill in February that would have required waterfront business to hire a percentage of city residents, saying that its passage would most likely result in a lengthy legal battle.
MORE recently, the development agency found itself in an embarrassing situation when Pettinaro Construction was accused of violating Federal environmental laws for illegally disposing of ignitable and toxic material near a riverfront park scheduled to be completed in July.
"Nothing's been easy," said Mr. Purzycki. "But we can't stop. We have to keep going."
That means pressing on with the development of a roughly 20,000-square-foot nightclub and the construction of a river walk extending 1.5 miles from just above the historic Amtrak passenger station to the retail complex. In next two years, construction will begin on boardwalks through a wildlife refuge south of the outlet center.
"We've still got at least five years' worth of work to do," Mr. Purzycki said.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Showing Managers The Door

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
BREAKING up is hard to do; knowing when to do it is even harder. Hiring a new managing agent -- a firm that handles the details of running a co-op, condominium or other multifamily building -- is similarly dicey; it is essential to gauge with some skill when the the old one must go.
"This is not exactly a refined art," said Arthur Davis, a management consultant in Manhattan. In most cases, he said, the assessment of a managing agent should at least focus on the responsiveness of the on-site manager, the efficiency of the back-office staff and the accessibility of the top management. 
 "One of the things to look for is the time between a request for something and the time it actually takes for the management company to respond," Mr. Davis said. "One of the first signs of a deteriorating relationship is that you're not getting the same responsiveness out of the site manager as you did when the relationship started."
Meanwhile, he said, the boards of buildings must ask themselves if back-office operations have deteriorated since the managing firm was first hired.
"I believe that every board member should get a printout of the financial statement on a monthly basis," Mr. Davis said, adding that with a few years' worth of monthly reports in hand, board members can get a sense of whether the building's finances have been handled consistently, with no significant deterioration.
And the lines of communication should always remain open between the building's board and the top officials of the managing firm.
"If you're coming to a point where the site manager isn't doing his job," Mr. Davis said, "you want to be confident that you can get the president of the company on the phone."
Richard B. Montayne, a co-op accountant in Roslyn, N.Y., said the efficiency of a managing agent could also be determined by deducing what isn't included in monthly financial statements.
"Missing reports or documents may be an indication that there is a problem," Mr. Montayne said. So, too, would increasing amounts of overtime for building employees -- a sign that an agent may be misjudging what is needed for the day-to-day operation of the building.
Marc Shernicoff, a Manhattan co-op accountant, said that in addition to assessing a managing agent's technical skills and its relationship with shareholders, a board must strike a balance in evaluating such criteria.
Some managing agents, he said, excel at building good relationships with residents but are less effective when it comes to paying bills. Others may be fiscal wizards with horrible bedside manners.
"I've seen buildings get rid of excellent managing agents because they didn't like the personality of the on-site manager," Mr. Shernicoff said. "And I've seen buildings stay with managing agents that are terrible just because they love the on-site guy."
If a managing agent has a good relationship with residents and responds quickly to their requests, he said, it may be possible to overlook minor deficiencies in back-office work.
On the other hand, Mr. Shernicoff added, if a managing agent is so determined to establish a cordial relationship with shareholders that it becomes sheepish about aggressively collecting maintenance fees, the board may want to trade in the firm for one that understands tough love.
But when does a board know that it's time to switch?
"You often don't know until it's too late," said Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. Mr. Shmulewitz said that some general strategies for assessing a managing agent's performance include determining whether it is taking advantage of all available bulk purchasing agreements, maximizing available discounts, comparison shopping for supplies that can't be bought in bulk and making efforts every year to try to keep down property taxes.
"You should also determine whether the management firm is following a tight and defined procedure for collecting maintenance charges," Mr. Shmulewitz said. "Find out when the first reminder gets mailed to shareholders in arrears. And find out at what point the managing agent will turn the matter over to the building's lawyer."
In addition, he said, boards should determine what criteria are used when a managing agent puts work out to bid.
"You should ask the executives of the management company what bidding procedure they are using," he said. "Are there a minimum number of bids required? Are the bids sealed or open? If the bids are sealed, who unseals them, and where are they unsealed?"
But how does a board determine, say, whether a managing agent is utilizing a "tight and defined procedure?"
"It's easy when you have clear financial statements," said Herb Rose, a co-op consultant in Manhattan.
For example, Mr. Rose said, determining whether the management firm is efficient in collecting maintenance charges is a matter of simple math.
"For me, the red flag is 5 percent," he said, explaining that if uncollected maintenance charges exceed 5 percent of total, the managing agent is not doing its job. Similarly, Mr. Rose said, if the total amount of bills not paid within 30 days exceeds 5 percent of total monthly expenses, that may be a sign that someone somewhere is dropping the ball.
"The managing agent should have a hands-on approach to running the building," he said, adding that another significant attribute is an ability to keep a board focused on a building's economic health.
This might include prodding the board to increase maintenance fees in order to keep reserve funds at an adequate level. "The bottom-line minimum should be two month's maintenance," Mr. Rose said. So, a building that collects $1.2 million in maintenance fees each year should have a working capital reserve of at least $200,000.
If a building is missing that mark, and the managing agent isn't urging the board to hit it, Mr. Rose said, it is possible that the agent is more interested in renewing its contract than in doing the best job possible. Contracts with managing firms generally run year to year.
In fact, Mr. Rose added, there is virtually no income-making or cost-cutting strategy that a competent, dedicated managing agent will overlook.
"If you can get a discount of 1 percent for paying a bill within 10 days, doesn't it make sense to pay the bill early and save the money?" he said.
Mr. Shernicoff, the accountant, offered this advice for boards that are in the process of deciding whether to replace their current managing agent:
"Talk to your other professionals," he said, explaining that since lawyers and accountants generally handle multiple clients, it is likely that they have dealt with a number of different managing agents and should be able to provide a board with some valuable insight.
Mr. Shernicoff also offered one additional and highly effective method for determining whether the time has come for a board and its managing agent to part company.
"Once you start wondering whether your agent is a clunker," Mr. Shernicoff said, "that's probably a good sign that it is."

HEADLINE: REIT's Place Their New York Area Bets

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
AS real estate investment trusts flourished around the country in recent years the New York City area was a comparative exception. But activity by REIT's in the area, each with a distinctive investment strategy, has picked up sharply.
In a little over a year real estate investment trusts have gone from being conspicuously absent from New York City to becoming a major force in the commercial property market. The publicly traded, tax-sheltered companies have bought property valued at $2.8 billion in Manhattan in the last year and a half. 
 The single biggest splash has been made by Vornado Realty Trust, based in Saddle Brook, N.J., but looming increasingly large in Manhattan. The company has made a huge bet that the area around Madison Square Garden will be the next Times Square in terms of economic revival and is preparing to develop it into the urban equivalent of an entertainment-oriented shopping mall.
According to the company, it has invested close to $2 billion in New York City office buildings, including the investments made so far this year, making it one of the city's larger landlords. It has said it plans to invest as much as $1 billion more in the city in the next two years.
Each of the REIT's operating in the region is following its own investment strategy, ranging from SL Green's exclusive focus on older Manhattan office buildings to Mack-Cali and Reckson's policies of completely avoiding the city in favor of suburban properties.
Steven Roth, the chairman of Vornado, said the company had bought most of the office, hotel and retail properties on both sides of Seventh Avenue from 34th to 31st Streets "because there is a lot you can do when ownership is concentrated in one strong hand.
"We bought the properties because we think we think we can redevelop them and improve them," he said. He noted that the Macy's Herald Square store was like one of the anchor stores of a suburban mall, and that the front door to Madison Square Garden is in 2 Penn Plaza, which the company owns.
"The streets are teeming with people day and night," he said, which for someone with deep roots in the retail business translates into potential customers. "The corner of Seventh Avenue and 34th Street is the second busiest in the city, which probably means it is the second busiest in the country."
Although Vornado was the biggest player among the REIT's buying property in Manhattan and the region, it was not the only one. Two home-grown real estate companies, SL Green Realty Corporation and Tower Realty Trust, each formed a REIT (pronounced reet) and sold shares to the public for the first time last year, and then went on acquisition sprees. And two existing suburban trusts, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation of Cranford, N.J., and Reckson Associates Realty of Melville, L.I., continued their expansion in the region, while avoiding New York City itself.
In the city, several prominent companies have taken steps to convert themselves from private ownership to the REIT form. Two New York companies, Macklowe Properties and Loeb Realty, have done the preliminary work necessary for initial public stock offerings, with Loeb in an arrangement to acquire the properties and management business of the George Comfort & Sons investment and management company. Several other companies, including Steven C. Witkoff's Witkoff Group and Larry A. Silverstein's Silverstein Properties, are reportedly primed to follow and form REIT's.
Another REIT, Boston Properties, is also active in New York and is buying the rights to develop two Times Square office sites.
The REIT's have by no means displaced the traditional family-owned companies that continue to own and develop large amounts of property. But as long as they have access to low-cost public capital, the REIT's are capable of fast growth through acquisition.
That access to capital can vary with market patterns, and many REIT's have been trading below their 52-week highs recently. Vornado, which has ranged from $32.50 to $49.813, closed Wednesday at $39.438. Reckson's price has ranged from $22 to $29, closing Wednesday at $24.25. Mack-Cali has fluctuated from $31.375 to $43, closing Wednesday at $34.125. Tower's price has ranged from $20.75 to $28.50, closing Wednesday at $22.438. SL Green, which closed Wednesday at $22.25, has moved between $21.063 and $28. Boston Properties has ranged from $26.25 to $36.063 and closed Wednesday at $34.313.
Share price is important for REIT's that want to expand; since they must pay out 95 percent of their income in dividends to retain their tax-exempt status, they have to return to the securities markets for capital or take on unwanted debt. One attraction of REIT's as investments is that they are typically not as leveraged as closely-held partnerships and thus are better able to ride out a decline in property values.
If they are faced with unresponsive investors, high-flying REIT's would have to slow their pace of growth, and some of the planned initial public offerings might be delayed, or their shares sold at prices below what their owners had in mind.
"The office REIT sector is down about 10 percent, year-to-date," said Lee Schalop, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities. "That means that their ability to sell stock to get money to build is curtailed."
Nevertheless, many REIT executives say that the cycle is nowhere near the peak and that now is a good time to buy property in New York, particularly in Manhattan. Some say they will borrow money, if necessary, to continue investing, although they do not want to become as highly leveraged as some closely held developers.
Real estate executives note that Manhattan has built-in protection against an overload of new supply. "If all the projects that are being talked about actually get built, they would add 6 million square feet of office space over a period of about 10 years," said Lawrence H. Feldman, the chairman of Tower Realty Trust. In the context of the 400 million square feet of existing space, he said, that amounts to an addition of about 1.5 percent.
In other words, the market is not likely to be overwhelmed by an influx of new building -- in contrast to the late 1980's, when 40 million square feet of office space was developed and marketed, much of it on a speculative basis.
Mr. Feldman's point, that Manhattan is an island already almost fully developed, was echoed by other real estate executives. They say that New York cannot add to its real estate supply the way that cities with a lot of nearby vacant land have done. If a REIT wants to become part of the New York City property market, its path is much more likely to be acquisition of existing buildings rather than development.
According to Mr. Feldman, whose REIT recently bought the 336,000-square-foot building at 90 Broad Street, the numbers are still favorable for acquisition. At a purchase price of $34.5 million, the Broad Street building cost slightly over $100 per square foot.
Rents there average $23 a square foot annually. Subtracting about $11 a square foot to operate the building produces a 12 percent return on investment, year after year. "Compare that to the $400-a-foot replacement cost," he said.
Mr. Feldman, who developed projects in the Phoenix and Orlando areas while building in New York all but ceased in the 90's, says the city is now the major focus of the company's efforts.
"Two-thirds of the company is in Manhattan," he said, adding that he expected Tower to make $200 million more in acquisitions in the city. The company already owns Tower 45 on 45th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, 100 Wall Street and 810 Seventh Avenue, at 53d Street.
Each of the REIT's operating in the metropolitan area has developed its own growth strategy based on its assessment of the market. For Reckson it has been to expand beyond its roots on Long Island and acquire properties and companies in New Jersey and in Westchester and Fairfield Counties.
Scott Reckler, the president and chief operating officer of Reckson, said his company had no plans to diversify more broadly geographically. "We are very bullish on the New York area," he said. "There are some unique investment opportunities here."
ALTHOUGH REIT's have been a part of the Federal tax code since 1960, they have become more important in the last 10 years as real estate managers have found public offerings a cheaper source of capital than more traditional methods.
Traditional investors, such as life insurance companies, are selling directly-owned properties and reinvesting the proceeds in REIT stocks as a more liquid way to own real estate. Indeed, when Steven C. Witkoff's Witkoff Group bought three towers, Numbers One, Three and Four, in Newark's Gateway Center from Prudential Insurance Company, the announcement said that if the Witkoff Group were to go public, "Prudential would have the opportunity to acquire an equity stake in the company."
The reason behind the REIT's rushing into New York was a change in the 10 percent capital gains tax on sales of over $1 million that had been enacted while Mario Cuomo was governor, said Kevin Haggarty, the executive managing director of Insignia Capital Advisors, a unit of Insignia/ESG. "While the Cuomo tax was in effect, if you transferred your property to a REIT it was considered a sale that triggered tax liability," he said. Since most REIT's in this area were started by family companies contributing their properties, the tax liability discouraged their formation. The tax has since been repealed.
Vornado started the REIT wave in the city early last year by purchasing the Mendik Company, which had itself been preparing for an initial public offering as a REIT. Vornado paid $656 million for four million square feet of office space.
In many cases REIT's can outbid other investors for closely-held properties because they can pay with a form of stock known as operating partnership units, which do not trigger a capital gains tax the way a cash sale would. The units are usually convertible into the REIT's common stock after a "lockup period," during which no such exchanges are allowed.
The overhang of operating partnership units, which dilute the value of a REIT's earnings by increasing the number of shares when converted, could be an issue in REIT stock price, some executives said. The increased number of shares would reduce the reported earnings per share.
REIT's do not always win bidding wars for trophy properties, as the recent contest for the General Motors Building at 58th Street and Fifth Avenue showed. With a bid of $800 million, Donald Trump, backed by the Conseco insurance company of Indianapolis, won the building in a bidding contest that involved several REIT's.
Although forming a REIT can give a developer access to low-cost capital, becoming a public company means complying with complex securities laws, dealing with Wall Street and revealing information many businesses prefer to keep private.
"REIT's have to answer to public markets and answer frequently," said Darcy Stacom, an executive director with Cushman & Wakefield. "With a syndication, there is a reckoning once a year, but with a REIT you are on the phone in a conference call with analysts every Monday morning." This constant attention from analysts may push REIT managers to press for short-term performance at the expense of long-term success, some fear.
It is also not clear that the analytic skills designed to evaluate industrial and commercial companies can be successfully applied to real estate, some people in the industry say. "I don't think Wall Street and the analysts have the ability to distinguish between a good deal and a bad deal," said James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark & Company Real Estate.
REIT's are tending to push up prices as they work to meet financial goals through growth, and would-be REIT operators are buying aggressively to build their portfolios in anticipation of going public, Mr. Kuhn said. "You have people who are poised to do their initial public offering, and they are buying properties to bulk up before going public," he said.
Not all real estate operators in New York are lured by the attractions of public ownership. Members of both the Durst and Rudin families, both major players in the Manhattan office market, have said they have no intention of forming REIT's.
Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W & M Properties, said his company operated like a virtual REIT, raising money from a pool of investors on a project-by-project basis. Mr. Malkin said that this form of financing allowed the company to focus on long-term performance. "A REIT is accountable on a quarterly basis, and the real estate operation may end up being secondary to the stock market," he said.
ANOTHER question is how REIT's will act in a market downturn. REIT executives argue that they will be in a better financial condition to keep up their properties than are debt-laden private operators. But some question whether the REIT's will have the management skills.
"These people are running big companies and they are good at financial engineering and managing funds from operations," said Robert Ageloff, a senior vice president of Equis, a national tenants' broker, referring to the REIT equivalent of earnings. "But will they be as good as New York's family landlords at tenant retention?"
One limitation on REIT's is that they are restricted largely to income-producing property in the investments they can make; managers have struggled to develop organizations that meet the requirements of the tax code while allowing them to do more than collect rent. One approach was the paired-share REIT, in which a separate company does the non-REIT work while the two have the same management and their stock shares trade as a unit.
But paired-share or "stapled" REIT's are no longer permitted, although a few, including Starwood and Patriot American, continue to operate because they were organized before the rules changed. To cope with the current circumstances the "paper clip" REIT has been developed. Like the paired-share REIT's, the two companies share management, but the shares of the two companies are not firmly linked and can trade separately.
Reckson has adopted the paper-clip format, with the parallel Reckson Service Industries able to invest in companies in developing industries such as the Internet and telecommunications that a pure REIT could not. Stock in Reckson Service was recently spun off to shareholders of the REIT.
Mr. Reckler said the recent low price of the company's stock would affect his plans. "We are long-term players, and adversity can breed opportunity," he said, implying that if planned public stock offerings cannot go forward, those companies who failed to sell stock could become acquisition targets by companies like Reckson.
Because of Reckson's strong balance sheet, he said, the company has no need to return to the equity market any time soon and can continue to grow.
Mr. Reckler has an expansive view of what the future holds for real estate companies like his. In a recent speech he noted that there was something on the order of $1 trillion in real estate held by major corporations, public institutions and municipalities. "I believe that in the future all real estate services will be outsourced to the real estate companies that are best equipped to provide this service," he said. "These services will include design, site selection development, management and, ultimately, ownership."
While Reckson has confined itself to the New York suburbs, what was known as Cali Realty has expanded to the Dallas area via a merger with the Mack Company and has become Mack-Cali. Thomas Rizk, the president and chief executive of Mack-Cali, said the merger was an outgrowth of the company's strategy.
"When we first went public we were basically a New Jersey story," he said. "We decided our strategy was to acquire the best management teams in the markets we wanted to be in." He said Cali had acquired the Robert Martin company, a leading Westchester County office developer, and 4.1 million square feet of office space as a means of getting into the northern suburbs of New York and had acquired properties as far south as Philadelphia. He said Mack-Cali's holdings were now about 75 percent in the Northeast and 25 percent in the southwest as a result of the Mack deal.
Mr. Rizk said the company would emphasize establishing a presence in markets, rather than simply buying widely scattered assets. And like Mr. Reckler, he said that if the stock market remained difficult he might buy properties from private investors who have purchased a lot of property in anticipation of going public and now find themselves saddled with debt.
WHILE some REIT's have emphasized geographic diversification, Stephen L. Green, the chief executive of SL Green Realty Corporation, concentrates on concentration. His strategy is to buy older office buildings in Manhattan, known as B buildings.
Mr. Green's argument is that without the lower rental rates of B buildings (compared to the newer A properties) many tenants would be forced to move from Manhattan to the other boroughs and the suburbs. "New York would not function without B buildings," he has said.
Mr. Green said he was following a strategy of buying well-situated B buildings in need of improvement, such as the properties at 70 West 32d Street and 1372 Broadway in the Garment District. "We are looking to buy deals that are consistent with our business plan," he said. "They are based on our ability to redevelop buildings."
The current low prices of REIT stocks "are a little like a self-inflicted wound," said Louis W. Taylor, a senior real estate analyst with Prudential Securities, who pointed out that a number of REIT's had brought stock offerings to the market in recent months. "There was a strong offerings calendar with equity issues being forced into a market with weak demand," he said. With the rate of offering slowing, he expects prices to recover in the second half of the year.
"It not that the REIT's have been doing anything wrong," said P. Anthony Brown, head of the REIT team at Arthur Anderson, the accounting and consulting company. "In general they have been hitting their earnings targets. It could be simply that other asset classes have been attracting more attention in the stock market."
Mr. Green, who recently raised $316 million for his SL Green REIT in a sale of 13 million shares of common and preferred stock, said he was not overly concerned about the decline in stock prices. "I think it is temporary," he said. "These trends are like the lengths of women's skirts."

Wildwood Wants a Casino, but the State Isn't So Sure

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
During the busy summer season, the Wildwood municipal parking lot at Schellenger and Pacific Avenues fills with cars whose passengers enjoy boardwalk amusements and the city's beach. Daily parking fees help finance the city's $4 million yearly operating budget.
But since 1995, some city officials and representatives of an Oklahoma Indian tribe have wanted to replace the lot with a casino that promises to pay the city $8 million a year, employ 600 to 1,000 residents, and expand Wildwood's tourist season from three months to year round. 
 Unlike the dozen gambling halls in Atlantic City 30 miles due north, the casino, to be built by the Delaware Tribe of Western Oklahoma, would not serve alcohol. It would have no restaurant, showroom or hotel wing, and would therefore not be able to provide favored gamblers with the free meals, entertainment and hotel accommodations that have forced some Atlantic City restaurants and hotels out of business. Gamblers who wanted to eat or stay overnight in Wildwood would be encouraged to patronize existing restaurants and hotels. Although the proposal attracted some local opposition, Wildwood's voters approved the casino project in a nonbinding referendum.
In the three years since Wildwood announced its development partnership with the Delaware Tribe, Camden and Trenton officials have indicated that they, too, would favor some kind of casino development.
State officials have consistently dismissed these proposals as impossible dreams. Because there are no Indian reservations in New Jersey, the 1977 Casino Gaming Act did not consider the possibility of casinos owned by Indians. The act did, however, amend the state Constitution to limit casino gambling to Atlantic City, with the provision that 8 percent of the city's gambling revenues would go to government programs benefiting the entire state. Any casino development outside Atlantic City would require further amendments to the Constitution, a process that no state legislator, even representing Wildwood, has been willing to initiate.
"I think it's safe to say that New Jersey government has shown it has a vested interest in protecting the gaming industry in Atlantic City, even though there isn't a single company operating a casino in Atlantic City that is based in New Jersey," said Andrew Sutor, a Ventnor-based casino development consultant who met with Camden and Trenton officials over waterfront casino projects on the Delaware River.
Since 1988, Mr. Sutor, a former executive at the Harrah's and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City, has consulted on 50 casino projects in the United States, Europe, South America and Asia. Of those, 25 are open for business, thanks to what Mr. Sutor calls "the concept of gaming in the public interest."
"Casinos bring visitors, entertainment, money, tax revenue and jobs and additional economic activity to places where there is a need for these things," he said. "We've had casinos in Atlantic City for 20 years. We've seen what gaming has done to Atlantic City and its surrounding region. We've seen what it hasn't done. The people who live and work in a municipality like Wildwood or Camden or Trenton, who pay taxes to the state, should have the right to decide if they want a casino in their midst and how that casino should operate. Should the state be telling them that they can't have a casino because Atlantic City can have a monopoly?"
Mr. Sutor said he knew of interest in casinos in other New Jersey cities, including Jersey City, Newark and Asbury Park. "Some of these cities have the same problems that Atlantic City had, with unemployment and decaying economic base, and a casino could be the thing to put them back on the map," he said.
"A single casino in Camden would put do better than every casino in Atlantic City because Camden is closer to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington than Atlantic City is, and most gamblers favor what's closest to where they live. A casino in Trenton would get a lot of business from New York because Trenton is less than an hour from New York by train. Everybody in the gaming industry is watching what goes on in Wildwood because the outcome could make it possible for all these cities in New Jersey to get gaming if they want it. What the Delaware Tribe is doing to get a casino down there is pure genius."
In March, the Delaware Tribe filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court against the City of Wildwood, arguing that the land on which the city has been incorporated originally belonged to the tribe and that the tribe was illegally deprived of the land in the 19th century, when the Federal Government compelled it to move to western Oklahoma. The tribe presented archeological evidence obtained in the vicinity of Wildwood that showed Indian habitation as early as 1700.
The suit did not mention the tribe's intention to build a casino, but it did raise concepts of sovereignty crucial to the Federal Indian Gaming Law of 1988. Under that law, a Federally recognized Indian tribe, like the Delaware of western Oklahoma, has the sovereign right to open a gambling hall on land that it owns or that is held in trust for the tribe. Although the tribe must first negotiate with state government, it may not require final approval from state government before opening the casino.
The City of Wildwood owns the parking lot at Schellenger and Pacific Avenues, and Mayor Fred Wager indicated that he was willing to hold the lot in trust for the Delaware Tribe as a possible settlement to the suit.
But the tribe voluntarily dropped the suit shortly after filing it. Jefferey April, a lawyer representing the tribe, said: "The tribe decided that the issues in the suit would better be heard in Federal court. Right now, the tribe is deciding whether it would be more in the tribe's interest to file in Federal court in New Jersey or in Oklahoma."
Mr. April said he expected a decision from the tribe in a few weeks.
The tribe's actions have inspired two Republican Assemblymen, Ken LeFevre of Atlantic County and George Geist, who represents Camden and Gloucester counties, to sponsor a bill calling for a Congressional amendment to the Indian Gaming Act of 1988 that would require state approval for Indian casino operations so that New Jersey can stop the Delaware Tribe from opening a casino in Wildwood.
Of specific concern to Mr. LeFevre was the possibility that a competing casino in Wildwood might affect the winnings of casinos in Atlantic City, thus reducing the tax revenues Atlantic City casinos provide to state government.
Mark Karavan, the Wildwood city solicitor, who expects to defend the city again if the Delaware Tribe files suit in Federal court, declined to comment on what effect this legislation might have on the lawsuit, or whether a settlement of the suit would result in the proposed casino.
"I will say that we had a referendum on the subject and that the referendum passed, showing a clear majority of our citizens in favor of it," Mr. Karavan said. "The mayor is for it because he believes in representing the majority. The majority should rule in some cases. This might be one of them."

Israeli Exchange Hopes Domestic Companies Keep One Foot at Home

BYLINE: By JESSICA STEINBERG 

DATELINE: TEL AVIV

 BODY:
DUAL citizenship is one advantage that Israel offers to keep immigrants coming. Now it is trying to use dual citizenship to keep stocks from leaving.
Officials of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, worried about a flight of prominent Israeli high-technology stocks to the Nasdaq market in the United States, are trying to entice them back. The exchange is hoping that these companies will at least agree to list their shares in both places. 
 But the likelihood of a return home for most of these listings is considered weak. The impediments range from a cumbersome Israeli bureaucracy to a perception that Nasdaq is the pre-eminent market for high-technology companies trying to raise money.
Nasdaq, of course, dwarfs the Tel Aviv exchange. The $266.4 billion market capitalization of Microsoft, perhaps the best-known Nasdaq stock, is three times the size of the market capitalization of all the listings on the Tel Aviv exchange.
More than 100 Israeli companies are listed on Nasdaq, making it the largest foreign source of new listings after Canada. Only five of those companies are also listed on the Tel Aviv exchange.
Worries about Nasdaq are not obvious in The City, the neighborhood that the 60-year-old Tel Aviv exchange calls home. Visitors see tree-lined streets and outdoor cafes filled with young Israeli brokers sipping coffee and speaking rapidly into cellular phones, a reflection of Israeli prosperity and technical advances that contrasts sharply with the economy of years ago, when the nation's best-known exports were Jaffa oranges and Uzi submachine guns.
The Tel Aviv exchange lists more than 650 companies, including banks, insurers, chemical manufacturers and construction companies. Ronit Harel, head of the exchange's listings department, said it was hoping to expand its listings, and her optimism is shared to some extent in Israeli brokerage firms.
"It will become in fashion to list in Israel," said Eli Nachum, head of trading at Zannex Securities, a firm in Tel Aviv. Nonetheless, he said, "the fact that Israeli companies aren't traded in both exchanges is a disadvantage."
TO many Israeli high-technology executives, Nasdaq is preferable because of its enormous liquidity. With far more money in the market, it is easier for stocks to be bought and sold at a fair price.
Moreover, most Israeli technology companies, whether they are selling high-speed modems or Internet security software, are exporting to the United States. More often than not, their investors are Americans who are more willing than their Israeli counterparts to place their faith and finances in risky ventures.
"Israeli investors are a little scared of the high-tech stocks," said Ron Levkovitz, co-general manager of Epsilon, a private portfolio and fund management firm in Tel Aviv.
Mr. Levkovitz said 90 percent of the Israeli equity market was held by local institutional investors, made up of pension funds and other large trust funds that by law can invest only 15 percent of their assets in stocks. Institutional investors in the United States, by comparison, put more than 50 percent of their assets in stocks.
In addition, Israeli fund managers cannot buy more than 10 percent of their stocks outside Israel.
Gil Schwed, chief executive of Checkpoint Software, an Israeli provider of security software, said he never thought about listing in Tel Aviv. Checkpoint listed on Nasdaq in June 1996 at $14 a share with a market capitalization of $450 million. The shares now trade at $32, with an average volume of one million shares a day and a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.
"It's all about prices," Mr. Levkovitz said. "No one in Israel will pay the kind of prices the high-techs are commanding in the U.S."
Mr. Schwed said that from his perspective, the Tel Aviv exchange was not sophisticated, with insufficient trading volume and too little analyst coverage. He also criticized what he called unwarranted restrictions on market freedom imposed by the Israeli Securities and Exchange Commission.
It is a common criticism. David Arzi, chairman of Nice Systems, a provider of telephone computer systems, lists on both exchanges. But he said listing on the Tel Aviv exchange was akin to walking down Jerusalem's Via Dolorosa, or Street of Sorrow, the winding path that Jesus supposedly took from prison to his Crucifixion.
Quarterly reports must be filed with the Israeli securities commission and sent to all shareholders before publication, and the company's full prospectus must be rewritten in Hebrew. There are also restrictions on employee stock options; if options are offered to more than 35 employees, the company must publish a new prospectus.
"It took four months to give stock options to 88 of our people," Mr. Arzi said. "In certain aspects, Israel is the last Bolshevik country."
The Israeli securities commission is re-examining its listing requirements to help lure the Israeli companies back.
Mr. Arzi's decision to list his company on the Tel Aviv exchange has not been all bad. Indeed, Nice Systems' experience is one reason that young Israeli companies might want to list their stock at home.
Nice first went public on the Tel Aviv exchange in December 1991. At the time, the company had $1 million in profits and needed cash to reinvest in its products. Mr. Arzi said he chose Tel Aviv over Nasdaq "because it's easier when the lifesaver speaks your language."
He said that was one of the company's smartest moves, partly because the Israeli market did not punish Nice for low profits in its early years. By the time Nice went public on Nasdaq in 1996, shares were $10. They soon tripled in value.
Elan Zivatofsky, a technology analyst for Goldman, Sachs in Israel, said Nice's experience also showed the wisdom of listing on Nasdaq.
"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the U.S. is more sophisticated and that U.S. investors are going to move Israeli shares on Nasdaq," he said.
NICE is currently the most liquid of the dual-listed Israeli shares -- 77 percent of its shares are held by United States shareholders. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Israel's largest pharmaceutical company and one of the Tel Aviv exchange's blue-chip stocks, is 60 percent owned by American stockholders.
Dan Suesskind, Teva's chief financial officer, said there was a nationalistic reason for listing on the Tel Aviv exchange, "just like building a Teva plant up north when there's shelling from Lebanon." However, Mr. Suesskind said, he will never leave Nasdaq, his home away from home. "Listing on Nasdaq has made all the difference for us," he said. "It's the difference between watering your company's crops from a plane instead of a pitcher."

Chart: "Conspicuous Absence"
So few of Israel's prominent high-technology companies are listed on the Tel Aviv exchange that the market does not tally them separately. Instead, most of the companies list on the Nasdaq stock market in the United States. Here is how the companies on the Tel Aviv exchange break down, by sector.

State Plans to Sell Marlboro Hospital Grounds

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
The state plans to sell most of the campus of the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital, which ceased operations last week.
About 411 of Marlboro's 594 acres will be put up for sale, said Dan Emmer, a spokesman for the State Treasurer's Office. He said he did not know what would happen to the remaining 183 acres. The land is a few miles north of Freehold, Monmouth County. 
 Built in 1931 with 800 beds, Marlboro was the second large institution New Jersey closed this year in its slow move to deinstitutionalize people with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities. The state increased Marlboro's out patient and support services and moved some patients into other hospitals, including Trenton Psychiatric Hospital; Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, near Parsippany, and Ancora Psychiatric Hospital, in Camden County.
In April, the state closed the North Princeton Developmental Center in Middlesex County, which opened in 1898 and housed mentally retarded people. Slightly more than half of its 1,054-acre campus will be sold, Mr. Emmer said.
For both properties, he said, the state's Economic Development Authority is working "to define the best approach" to selling the property. He said that process included discussions with "interested parties," whom he would not name.

HEADLINE: For Banks, A Big Nudge To Do More

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
UNION AVENUE between East 156th Street and Westchester Avenue in the Bronx is a small, humble block lined with squat apartment buildings marked by occasional splashes of graffiti. Chain-link fences hem in some yards; nearby, subway cars rattle loudly on an overhead track.
Just five years ago, drug dealers controlled the neighborhood and many of its buildings. Today, the dealers are gone, pushed out by the police and by new residents who have rehabilitated some of the buildings. One morning last week, people chatted amiably on stoops and sidewalks. Some of them would like to see others -- particularly banks -- share their faith in the neighborhood's future. 
George Rabel, the 38-year-old owner of La Marketa Barioa, a tiny bodega on Union Avenue, is among those hoping that a broader economic revival is in store for the neighborhood. But he has his doubts.
"I've been in business for nine years and I go to the bank looking for a credit line when I get short of cash," he said. "They tell me no. To get credit you have to have a credit history, but you can't have a credit history if nobody gives you a chance."
As an unprecedented merger boom continues to spawn new giants in the banking industry, the needs of borrowers like Mr. Rabel are at the center of a heated debate among community groups, lenders and politicians over the financial service industry's commitment to low-income neighborhoods across the country.
The partners in both of the biggest recently announced mergers -- Citicorp-Travelers Group and Nationsbank-BankAmerica -- recently unveiled multibillion-dollar lending packages to low-income communities that dwarf similar commitments previously made by other banks.
The pledges build upon what activists and regulators acknowledge to be a vastly improved record by banks when it comes to low-income lending -- one that has helped, along with a strong economy, to bring some vitality back to many low-income communities in the 90's.
But community groups complain that some of the outsized lending programs announced lately are designed to curry favor with the Federal Reserve, which must approve the mergers, rather than truly meet credit needs in disadvantaged areas. The most egregious example, community advocates say, is Citicorp, the New York bank that is merging with Travelers Group to create the world's largest financial services concern.
As part of their merger application, Citicorp and Travelers, which will be known as Citigroup, have promised the Federal Reserve that they will make $115 billion in loans to low-income and minority communities over the next 10 years. Community groups say that figure, large as it appears, is small relative to pledges from other banks -- notably a $350 billion, 10-year pledge by Nationsbank and the BankAmerica Corporation.
In the past, moreover, low-income lending programs were designed with the needs of a bank's local market in mind. But the Citicorp-Travelers deal is all about creating financial supermarkets, not opening local branches. And community groups say the lack of geographic specificity in the partners' lending pledge may make it less meaningful.
Plus, Citicorp and Travelers are promising about $60 billion in consumer loans, a large but unspecified portion of which will be credit cards presumably bearing high interest rates -- hardly the stuff that fuels home-buying or economic development, say the companies' critics.
"It erodes the concept of community lending to have the most powerful financial institution in the country disinterested in it," said John Taylor, executive director of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a Washington organization that represents 678 community groups. "A substantial portion of their commitment represents what has historically been a problem in low-income communities: credit card debt."
FOR its part, Citicorp, which has been orienting its entire business toward more affluent customers and which, until recently, sharply scaled back its mortgage operations in low-income areas, says regulations governing low-income lending do not specify or favor certain types of loans. Citicorp says it considers credit cards to be a legitimate form of low-income lending.
"Each institution, each bank, has to pursue its business and emphasize those things it's good at," said Pamela Flaherty, senior vice president for community activities at Citicorp. "We happen to be good at consumer lending and student loans and credit cards."
What gives community groups a forum is the Community Reinvestment Act, a Federal law passed in 1977 that requires a bank to help meet "the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation" of the bank.
Because a poor record under the law offers regulators grounds for scuttling a merger (though that almost never happens), merger time has come to mean negotiating time for banks and community groups. Last month, the Fed held public hearings in New York on the Citicorp-Travelers merger, evoking a spectrum of responses, including a protest by activists brandishing red umbrellas like those that Travelers uses as its logo.
In the Midwest, community groups and Banc One have reached an impasse in negotiations surrounding the bank's merger with the First Chicago NBD Corporation. The activists would like top executives to commit to a reinvestment plan, but Banc One says it prefers to make commitments market by market.
While many bankers privately say that the negotiating process leaves them feeling shaken down by community groups, activists say that is hardly their intention.
"The position of community groups is not to be opposed to financial modernization, per se," says Matthew Lee, executive director of Inner City Press-Community on the Move, a New York group that often challenges big bank mergers. "It's to insure that C.R.A. doesn't get watered down by these combinations and that low-income people retain access to the financial system."
Because of ambiguities about how the Community Reinvestment Act was to be enforced, the law lay mostly fallow until 1989, when regulators issued clearer criteria for judging banks' compliance. In 1992, Congress followed up by requiring lenders to make data on mortgage applications publicly available.
The fuller disclosure -- and heightened scrutiny by the Clinton Administration -- strengthened the hand of community groups and contributed to big increases in banks' low-income lending.
Since 1992, lending commitments under the law have totaled $875 billion, compared with just $8.8 billion in pledges from 1977 to 1991, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.
"There's no question that banks' volume of lending in low-income and minority census tracts has increased dramatically," Mr. Lee said. "On the downside, the C.R.A. as written doesn't speak to the type of loans being made or what exactly constitutes lending to low-income areas."
According to a report soon to be released by the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington, greater access to housing loans has improved the quality of life in many disadvantaged areas. In low-income areas in 22 of 23 cities studied for the report, access to housing loans remained stable or went up between 1991 and 1997. In 11 of those 22 cities, "significant improvements" were registered.
But community groups say they are concerned that other types of lending, particularly lending to small businesses, might fall by the wayside as big banks link up.
Debates about how broadly the Community Reinvestment Act should be construed have gained momentum because of the changes sweeping through the financial services industry.
The proposed combination of Citicorp and Travelers, for example, would mesh traditional banking with brokerage services, insurance, mutual funds and stock and bond underwriting. But of these businesses, only banking falls under the purview of the law. And as such mergers continue, community groups worry that the momentum gained in low-income lending will be undercut.
"We see the same kind of redlining problems with home insurance as we do with lending, but insurance isn't covered by C.R.A.," said Patrick Woodall, a policy analyst with Acorn, a community group based in Washington. "And if you can't get home insurance, you can't buy a house."
Many banks feel unfairly singled out by the law, arguing that the responsibility for community lending should be extended to competitors like mutual fund companies and brokerage firms.
"About 70 percent of the traditional deposit dollar is now deposited outside of traditional banks, and that issue needs to be addressed," said Catherine P. Bessant, Nationsbank's president for community investment.
It is unlikely, however, that any expansion of the law's scope is on the horizon.
IN the Senate's consideration of a bill that would break down the Depression-era legal barriers separating banking and other financial services, Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, and other members of the Banking Committee have proposed doing away with the community-lending law entirely.
But President Clinton, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the committee, all oppose gutting the law. So observers say the law is likely to survive without significant changes.
Community groups, however, say the act already has been weakened by banking regulators too willing to give high marks to the vast majority of banks for their low-income lending.
In 1991, according to the Federal Reserve, 11 percent of the banks it examined received "outstanding" ratings under the act, and 80 percent received "satisfactory" marks. Only 8 percent were judged "need to improve" and 1 percent deemed in "substantial noncompliance."
Little has changed during this decade. Although banks previously given low marks receive the closest scrutiny, so far this year, 19.7 percent of the banks examined by the Fed have received "outstanding" marks, 78.2 percent were judged "satisfactory," 1.6 percent were graded "need to improve" and 0.5 percent were found in "substantial noncompliance."
Community activists also complain that the Fed -- one of several agencies that can perform compliance reviews, depending on how a bank is chartered -- is predisposed to big banking mergers. They note, for example, that the Fed held public hearings on the community impact of the First Union Corporation's recent acquisition of Corestates Financial only after the agency was pressured by activists and politicians.
While conceding a certain amount of grade inflation in community-lending examinations, Edward M. Gramlich, one of seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, said that does not mean the Fed disregards banks' lending patterns when it reviews mergers.
"It is not as quantitative as we might like it to be, but it's certainly not a pro forma approval process," Mr. Gramlich said. "There is no formal enforcement mechanism because of the way the law was written. The main enforcement tool is when we look at merger applications, and from my vantage point, we look at them pretty hard."
But Mr. Gramlich acknowledged that the scale of some of the latest bank mergers has complicated the regulators' ability to assess compliance with the lending law, especially as some banks begin to spread their wings across the entire country. The issue is what "community" a bank should be reinvesting in.
"With the megamergers that are engulfing the whole country, it does become difficult to understand what the assessment area is," Mr. Gramlich said. "I think the process will become one of banks negotiating with their regulators about where their assessment area will be."
As it is, anyone trying to examine a pledge under the Community Reinvestment Act is confronted with a welter of numbers that complicate efforts to compare banks' records or sort out exactly what a given bank considers to be a community development loan.
For instance, a study released last month by the Treasury Department's inspector general's office criticized as unreliable examinations in 1996 and 1997 by the Comptroller of the Currency, another bank regulator. And while the Comptroller's office says it has addressed the problems, officials insist that the real issue is not reliability, but the subjective standards of the law.
"We did not create a bright-line standard that establishes a certain percentage or number of loans in a certain category to generate a rating," said Steve Cross, the deputy comptroller for community and consumer policy. "What the inspector general characterizes as inconsistencies, I would characterize as the appropriate exercise of judgment by an examiner."
From the banks' perspective, the law results in what sometimes seems like little more than a numbers game.
"C.R.A. has become a volume-oriented game, with up being good and down being bad," said Ms. Bessant of Nationsbank. "I worry about crazy pricing and crazy credit as everybody tries to generate more loans in order to get a better rating."
Yet Nationsbank, the company's critics contend, is hardly above playing the numbers game itself as it pursues its merger with BankAmerica. The two banks say that their huge C.R.A. pledge, $350 billion over 10 years, is about the same as the total amount pledged by all other banks over the last two decades.
Embedded in that pledge, however, are loans that other banks do not typically count as community investment. For example, Nationsbank is including mortgage loans to upper-income members of minority groups, even though the reinvestment act emphasizes income levels -- not race -- in its guidelines.
"There is a lot in that commitment that is outside of C.R.A. but expands the idea of community development," Ms. Bessant said. "To the extent that minority borrowers have had a more difficult time accessing credit, it's very relevant under this commitment to report our minority lending at all income levels."
Like so many numbers, how the lending pledges are construed depends on who is doing the construing.
On an annual basis, Nationsbank and BankAmerica are promising to lend about 6 percent of their combined assets to low-income borrowers -- a figure that the partners pointedly noted in a press release will not include credit cards. By comparison, the new Citigroup pledges to lend about 1.7 percent of its assets.
BUT Nationsbank and BankAmerica will have more traditional domestic retail deposits than Citicorp and Travelers, noted Ms. Flaherty of Citicorp. Judged against that base -- which, she said, is a better measure of a bank's local lending activity -- Citigroup's lending pledge is more formidable: about 21 percent of the merged companies' domestic deposit base, versus about 10 percent for the combined Nationsbank-BankAmerica.
However the numbers are added up, community groups say the merger partners' big promises are too vague.
"A $350 billion C.R.A. pledge could have no impact on low-income and minority communities because C.R.A. can be interpreted so broadly," said John Gamboa, executive director of the Greenlining Institute, a San Francisco advocacy group.
Community groups say small-business loans to liquor stores or check-cashing outfits can be part of a community-investing tally in a low-income area, even though many residents do not see those kinds of businesses as contributing to economic development. And mortgage loans for low-income borrowers can be structured in ways that make them inaccessible to the borrowers who need them -- if required down payments are too high, for example, or repayment schedules too swift.
"If the commitment is not tied to a specific local credit and capital need as identified by the lender in conjunction with community investment leaders, and does not include a mechanism that allows for community involvement in the monitoring and evaluation of that commitment, then it isn't real," said Mr. Taylor of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. Citicorp, Travelers, Nationsbank and BankAmerica, he said, put together their big pledges very quickly and with minimal input from community groups.
But bankers are extremely reluctant to be more specific about the types or locations of loans they will make under their community investment pledges, arguing, as does Nationsbank's Ms. Bessant, that such precision would "prevent us from having market flexibility."
Back in the Bronx, just a few miles north of the world's banking center, Union Avenue residents talk about the risks they have taken putting up their own cash to renovate apartments that were once uninhabitable. Now, they would like to advance another notch.
"How are small businesses and people going to get the money they need to move the neighborhood to another level?" asked 22-year-old Roberto Suero. "We have initiative here, but no banks."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Gorging On a Diet Of Deals

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
THEY are serial acquirers -- companies that play Pac-Man by gobbling up other companies, paying for the purchases with high-priced stock. It's a cycle that feeds voraciously on itself: The more a company acquires, the higher the stock price, fueling even more acquisitions.
The buyers include companies like Republic Industries and Nationsbank, Cendant and Worldcom. They promise investors that they will make money by transforming industries, providing tremendous economies of scale and greater efficiencies. 
 Early in the cycle, it may indeed work out that way. But investors can find it impossible to tell when the game is about to come to a grinding halt -- rudely punishing the acquirer's stock.
Shares in the newly formed Cendant Corporation lost nearly half their value after the company disclosed in April that one of its businesses, the former CUC International, had overstated earnings. Waste Management's troubled accounting and ill-fated diversification attempts eventually crushed its shares and are driving the company into the arms of a rival. U.S. Office Products' profits have slumped and the company recently ended up spinning off four units composed of some of its purchases.
What all serial acquirers -- the successful and the not-so-successful -- have in common is that their finances can confound even the most sophisticated investors. Buyers of these companies' stocks must decide whether to risk being swept up in the deal-making in the hopes of riding a stock up further. The sheer complexity of putting together dozens of companies or more -- in each of its most frantic years, Waste Management bought as many as 100 companies -- makes it nearly impossible to see whether the acquiring company's strategy is working.
Adding to the confusion is that many of these companies employ accounting sleight of hand; in perfectly legal maneuvers, they mask the real cost of their acquisitions through write-offs, leaving the buyers looking more profitable than they really are.
In sorting this out, investors get little help from Wall Street analysts, who often play along. After all, corporations can come down hard on naysayers. Thomas K. Brown, until recently a banking analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, long criticized the acquisition strategy of the First Union Corporation, which has made more than 70 acquisitions since 1985. As a result, he said, he was excluded from one-on-one meetings at First Union's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. (First Union said it had never refused to meet with Mr. Brown.)
Another analyst, who asked not to be identified, recalled being threatened with a lawsuit by one serial acquirer after publicly questioning its purchases. Why the heavy-handed treatment? "So much depends on the stock price," he surmised.
Analysts can also be reluctant to look too closely at any one transaction for fear that their company might lose the lucrative investment banking fees on the acquirer's next deal.
 A result of this combination of complexity and analysts' see-no-evil, speak-no-evil approach is that the guidepost usually followed by investors -- the analysts' estimated growth rate of earnings -- can vary so wildly for these companies as to be nearly meaningless. Analysts following Worldcom, for example, peg its annual earnings growth rate at anywhere from 20 percent to more than 50 percent, a range that suggests they are doing little more than guessing.
Enthusiastic analysts are not always wrong, of course, and many investors enjoy long rides up with the stock of acquisition-happy businesses. "Lots of companies have successfully changed the profitability of an industry by acquiring," said John W. Ballen, the chief equity officer for MFS Investment Management in Boston, citing Republic Industries, Computer Associates and Cardinal Health as examples.
But other seasoned investors and analysts are so wary of the serial acquirers that they simply steer clear. "I don't feel comfortable covering a company that makes so many acquisitions," said Stephen Sanborn, the research director for Value Line of New York, which provides stock analysis to individual investors. Value Line does not cover Starwood Hotels and Resorts, for example, whose buying spree of about 40 businesses in the last three years includes this year's purchase of the ITT Corporation for $15 billion.
As a company gets larger, said Robert A. Olstein, a portfolio manager in Purchase, N.Y., "the pressure on keeping that going is growing." Mr. Olstein, who has spent decades scrutinizing companies' financial statements, also avoids these stocks. Eventually, he said, the chief executive "reaches too far," making an acquisition that leads the company to stumble.
Sometimes, of course, the game goes on so long that analysts and investors catch on. First Union has been engaged in its feeding frenzy for more than a dozen years, and the drops in its stock price after several of the bank's recent acquisitions indicate that many on Wall Street have grown tired of the game. But because of the deals' complexities, the so-called experts can be just as ignorant as the average investor about an acquirer's true performance, and the rapid rise in many of these companies' stocks suggests that the game remains as popular as ever.
A close look at three of these companies -- Worldcom, First Union and United States Filter -- illustrates the challenges for investors in evaluating a serial acquirer.
 
Worldcom
Snazzier Results Via a Juggling Act
Looking at the financial results of a serial acquirer is difficult enough -- the footnotes in its reports are full of references to actual results and pro forma results, depending on how the company is putting together the numbers for different businesses. But making it even more difficult to decipher performance are accounting techniques that allow companies to erase "goodwill" -- a measure of how much a company pays over the book value of an acquisition -- and thereby insure that their future earnings do not reflect the hefty price of their purchases.
For Worldcom Inc., the strategy of gobbling up other telecommunications players, mostly through stock-based purchases, has been a raging success to date. "They actually understand their business and make moves that are strategically intelligent," said Michael J. Mahoney, who owns the stock as the manager of the AIM Global Telecommunications fund. Shares of Worldcom, which is based in Jackson, Miss., have gained an average of around 50 percent annually over the last three years.
The overwhelming majority of analysts who follow Worldcom continue to urge investors to buy the stock, despite the drastic changes ahead as the company swells more than four times its current size with its pending $37 billion acquisition of the MCI Communications Corporation. (The final purchase price depends on a number of factors, including the price of Worldcom's stock.)
The analysts' logic goes something like this:
Worldcom is expected to earn $1.95 a share in 1999. With an estimated long-term growth rate around 30 percent a year, the stock can command a price-to-earnings multiple of 25 to 30, roughly in line with its growth rate. Presto: The stock is worth $48.75 to $58.50, making it a buy at its current price of $50.1875.
In that equation, however, the key number is the growth rate. On its own, MCI has been a much slower grower than Worldcom, says Anthony F. Ferrugia, an analyst at A. G. Edwards and one of the rare members of his profession not pushing the stock. And Worldcom is paying a huge premium for MCI. So while there may be substantial savings when the two companies combine, it is not at all clear to him how fast the combined company can grow.
"When I look at all those numbers, I don't have a crystal ball," Mr. Ferrugia said.
Mr. Mahoney acknowledges that achieving the projection of 30 percent-plus growth "takes everything working."
It also takes a little accounting magic. Over the last two years, Worldcom has managed to bolster its future earnings by a little more than $2.5 billion by making a like amount of goodwill vanish through write-offs, which are usually discounted by investors as one-time anomalies.
The technique used by Worldcom is becoming increasing popular, particularly when, because they have been buying back stock or for other reasons, companies cannot treat an acquisition as a pooling of interests, in which no goodwill is created. Instead, the buyer contends that some part of the price of a purchase is acquired research, which must be written off immediately under current accounting rules.
That, effectively, increases future earnings by reducing the amount of goodwill amortized each year, a figure that is subtracted from earnings on a company's income statement. For acquirers, the attraction of this technique is that management gets to determine how much goodwill it can write off: it is the buyer that assigns a value to the acquired research, although managements bring in appraisers to help.
"It is a very, very subjective estimate," said Baruch Lev, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who has recently completed a study of the technique.
What concerns Professor Lev is the possibility that investors are failing to discount such companies' future higher earnings. "Some of this growth in earnings and high return on equity will turn out to be bogus," he predicted.
Look at what would happen to Worldcom's earnings-per-share numbers if the company had not taken those write-offs in the last two years. If it had amortized the goodwill over 20 years -- Worldcom's practice varies from 10 years to 40 years -- it would have eliminated roughly $125 million a year in goodwill expenses, or around 12 cents a share. If estimated 1999 earnings were, therefore, $1.83 a share, the stock, at a multiple of 25 to 30, would today be worth $45.75 to $54.90. And that would make it less of a buy.
Investors should be prepared to see the same technique used when Worldcom completes its merger with MCI, which is expected to result in about $25 billion in goodwill, the premium it is paying for MCI. Worldcom may write off some of that sum as acquired research -- about $3 billion, according to the company. "It could very well be a higher number," added Gary Brandt, Worldcom's vice president for investor relations.
Mr. Brandt argues that Worldcom is already being penalized by its accounting for earlier purchases, from which the amortization of goodwill wipes out about 50 cents of earnings per share a year, he said. The company, he added, relies on independent appraisals to determine how much it can write off for research and stays well within accepted accounting practice.
Kevin M. Moore, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown, dismisses the significance of Worldcom's accounting treatment. "The creation of goodwill is an accounting charge and does not change its cash flow," Mr. Moore said, adding that the latter is the most important measure in determining what a company is worth.
And he is not concerned about how Bernard J. Ebbers, Worldcom's chief executive, arrives at his results. "As long as they do $2, however they do it is fine with me," he said.
Professor Lev counters that analysts rely heavily on earnings in valuing companies, so how they come up with those numbers is important.
"Accounting is accountability," he said, adding that managers have little incentive to pay less for an acquisition if they do not have to account for its full price.
 
U.S. Filter
How Fast Does Your Company Grow?
Serial acquirers are so difficult to analyze because of the guesswork in determining even the most basic information about a company. How fast would it grow if it had made no acquisitions? How fast are its new businesses growing?
Few companies have been shopping as busily as the United States Filter Corporation, which has completed more than 150 acquisitions since 1991 -- roughly 60 in the last year alone -- to become the nation's largest provider of water-treatment systems.
There is a logic to the strategy of the company, which is based in Palm Desert, Calif. "You have an industry that's just ripe for consolidation," said Patrick S. Adams, a portfolio manager for Berger Associates in Denver who owns the stock.
But keeping track of all of U.S. Filter's activities is nearly impossible. Its frenetically acquired operations range from waste-water treatment plants to the sale of bottled water. And the sheer number of purchases means that most investors do not know how quickly certain businesses are growing and how profitable they are.
"How many people have done real in-depth models for every division they've acquired?" asked one portfolio manager, who has owned the stock but asked not to be identified. "Probably no one."
The real mystery may be the company's internal growth rate, which is the measure of how quickly U.S. Filter is increasing its business without the benefit of all of its acquisitions. Like a lot of companies, U.S. Filter will tell curious analysts what that rate is -- somewhere in the vicinity of 10 percent -- but the figure never appears in the financial statements available to the average investor. "It is an estimate, yes," said Tim L. Traff, a co-founder of the company and its executive vice president for development.
And while U.S. Filter has been quick to supply anecdotal evidence of how its purchases have fared, a more systematic appraisal is essentially impossible, because the company does not provide detailed information about every purchase, said Rod Lache, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. Mr. Lache, who nevertheless recommends the stock, concedes that the anecdotes "are not helpful in modeling" the company's future performance.
In fact, figuring out how U.S. Filter's purchases have fared proved so challenging that the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company earlier this year to improve the disclosure in the company's public financial statements.
The S.E.C. declined to comment, and the company said its discussions with the commission were routine.
"We give out as much information as we humanly can on a daily basis," Mr. Traff said.
Like Worldcom, U.S. Filter seems to be a master of accounting wizardry, which contributes to the difficultly in estimating future earnings growth.
According to the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a group in Rockville, Md., that studies corporate accounting for professional investors, U.S. Filter took several charges in its December quarter that could help inflate future earnings. The company's acquisition last month of Culligan Water Technologies for $1.5 billion in stock complicates matters further because Culligan itself made more than 35 acquisitions in its most recent fiscal year and took several charges.
U.S. Filter defends its accounting as appropriate and has promised to take away at least some of the mystery. Starting with its quarterly results due out in August, the company said, it plans to disclose more information about its individual divisions, like their revenues and operating margins.
"It's the first time we'll be able to dissect the company and judge the progress of the company," said Mr. Lache, who, with the information that is available, ha projected an earnings growth rate of 25 percent or more for U.S. Filter.
 
First Union
Share Sags May Spur Game Plan Change
Eventually, analysts and investors can judge the results of a serial acquirer's strategy. If they grow skeptical -- even sending the stock down on news of another purchase -- a company may send its Pac-Man strategy packing. First Union seems to be taking that step.
In the whirl of acquisitions among banks, First Union has been among the busiest, growing from a single-state bank with about $7 billion in assets in 1984 to a 12-state banking giant with $220 billion in assets.
But some analysts and investors have grown sharply critical of the bank's strategy and say its acquisitions have diluted its earnings. The market's judgment is that First Union has overpaid for its purchases, using stock with a relatively low price-to-earnings multiple to pay for companies with higher P/E ratios. "Guess what -- that causes dilution," said Mr. Brown, the early critic of First Union. He is now working for Tiger Management, a money manager in New York.
The company's stock has certainly suffered. Over the last five years, First Union has returned 184 percent, compared with a 304 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's large-bank index. On the day last November when First Union announced it would buy Corestates Financial in a $17.1 billion deal, First Union's stock lost more than $2 a share -- roughly a 4 percent drop. Regardless of the bank's efforts to show that its acquisitions make sense, "the market is saying that these deals do not have as much economic value," said David Ellison, a portfolio manager for the brokerage firm Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
First Union has apparently heard Wall Street's complaints, although the bank declined to comment on its strategy. Edward E. Crutchfield, its acquisitive chairman, is now telling analysts and investors that the bank will not pursue deals in which it must pay a premium, like its acquisition of Corestates, but instead will look for a partner with which to achieve a "merger of equals."
Mr. Ellison, for one, is not so easily convinced. He said First Union's management, having watched the bank's stock suffer, would try to increase the P/E ratio. Cynics might argue that executives are trying to get "the currency up so they can do a deal," he said.
In general, it pays to be skeptical of any company whose fast growth is largely a result of a frenetic buying spree. The company will almost surely stumble, said Mr. Ballen of MFS, who is a big shareholder in one recent sufferer, Cendant. "It's going to happen," he said. "I'm sure that it's happened to every company that makes acquisitions."
And that is why investors who are interested in reducing their risks might want to consider sitting out this particular game.

"The Pac-Man Offense"
Like the hero of the classic video game, companies have been dining on rivals, growing through one acquisition after another. What these serial acquirers share are finances complex enough to confound the most sophisticated analyst. Some examples:
 
Levitated
Earnings enhanced by highly subjective write-offs have helped sustain Worldcom's share price.
 
Obscured
Disclosures like this one illustrate how acquisitions make it difficult to follow U.S. Filter's financial performance.
 
Punished
After more than a decade of acquisitions, the market has concluded that First Union is spending too much on its deals. (pg. 1)

Finding the Silver Linings in Japan's Storm Clouds

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
DEN FUJITA, one of Japan's most successful and iconoclastic businessmen, is reveling in Japan's economic woes. As the owner of half of McDonald's Japan, Mr. Fujita has so relentlessly slashed prices of burgers, shakes and fries that it's now cheaper to buy a Big Mac in Tokyo than in New York -- even without the yen's recent tumble. Profits are soaring, and Fujita-san is crowing.
"These bad times are a good thing for me," he said. "No problems at all for us, not one." 
 Mr. Fujita is a rare bird these days, when most economists and world leaders see nothing redeeming in Japan's skid into a recession that took hold last winter and now threatens to undermine the already faltering economies of the rest of Asia.
Instead of taking its medicine seven years ago when recession loomed after the collapse of the real estate market, Japan persisted in a policy of denial, keeping the economy stumbling along with public works projects and lenient accounting rules that allowed banks to paper over bad loans and corporations to dress up their balance sheets.
For all its dodging and feinting, Japan has become the pariah of the global economy, which is itself under threat from a Japanese economic meltdown. Japan is still the world's second-largest market, and as such is an integral part of the global financial system. If Japan sneezes, the world is liable to catch a cold.
But some economists say there is a silver lining in the black clouds scudding across the Japanese economic horizon. The nation's current credit crunch, weaker yen, higher unemployment and lower prices, these economists maintain, actually present an opportunity for an economic restructuring that would return the nation to economic preeminence. "There is a potential strong upside to Japan's downside," said David Asher, a Japan scholar at Oxford University. "Structural adjustment will inevitably be painful and socially and politically disconcerting. However, no pain, no gain."
 
An Alternate Strategy
Mr. Asher is by no means a wide-eyed optimist. He is the co-author, with Andrew Smithers, of a damning portrait of the Japanese economy published last March by the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. They argue that mountains of debt, growing loan defaults, low productivity and falling asset prices and birth rates will turn Japan into an economic has-been if the Government fails to clean up the banking system, and persists in trying to hold off market forces.
Instead, the authors maintain, tighter bank lending and lower prices should force Japanese businesses to become leaner and more efficient. And rising unemployment need not be a cause for panic, given Japan's demographics, changing workplace culture and the experience of American businesses that rebounded from the downsizing of the early 1990's. Last week the Government did announce a sweeping rescue plan that would close insolvent banks and clear away bad debt, which Mr. Asher says is a good start.
While a Japanese collapse might be in Japan's long-term interest if it forces a thorough economic revamping, it would almost certainly clash with the rest of the world's short-term interests; when the yen went into a free fall last month, the American stock market retreated and exporters around the world began toting up the losses they would suffer from the coming flood of cheaper Japanese products.
But if Japan keeps postponing wrenching reform, its economy will continue to languish, further postponing a recovery in the region -- which will eventually take a toll on economies in Europe and in the United States.
"What if Japan had a hard landing but a fast bounce-back?" said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in Tokyo. "That would be good for Japan and ultimately good for the rest of Asia, too."
Take the falling prices that thrill Mr. Fujita. For years, tourists to Japan have dined out on tales of Japan's $200 cantaloupes and $6 strawberries, but Japanese housewives have had to live with the reality of a $2 zucchini and $12 bag of rice. It's no wonder people are flocking to McDonald's, particularly at a time when companies are cutting bonuses and other perks.
The Japanese stand to benefit from lower prices for consumer goods, Mr. Asher said, as well as lower land and asset prices. Once the prices of real estate and other assets reflect their true value, companies will be able to produce higher returns on their investments, which in turn will lead to more investment and economic growth.
The same thinking goes for tighter bank lending. Small and midsize businesses have had difficulty getting loans from banks, which are themselves scrambling to meet international standards for capital and disclosure.
Bankruptcies have skyrocketed as individuals and small entrepreneurs have found themselves unable to get loans, which in the past they had used to repay old debts. The fact that banks are breaking that vicious cycle and saying no -- after years of saying yes with little regard for creditworthiness or business rationale -- is an enormous step toward a more realistic allocation of capital. It is a very painful process but one destined to put the financial system on sounder footing and make businesses leaner and more competitive. Another area of concern is unemployment, which is running at a postwar high. For decades, the West has bemoaned Japan's system of lifetime employment, but now that the system is breaking down, a number of foreign economists are wringing their hands over the accompanying layoffs.
It is true that Japan's social safety net is woefully insufficient. Laid-off workers receive an average monthly handout of about $360 at current exchange rates, according to Douglas Ostrom, who has written extensively about Japanese economic reform. And the Government is far more likely to finance a new bridge or railway track as an antidote to unemployment than commit money to bolstering the welfare system.
But some economists say the anxiety over unemployment ignores the fact that the nation will face a labor shortage after the year 2000 because of low birth rates. Thus, most workers losing their jobs as the economy restructures should eventually find new ones -- as long as the Government fosters programs to develop new skills.
American companies slashed tens of thousands of workers from payrolls in the early 1990's, but now the nation has one of the tightest labor markets in memory. Because of Japan's low birth rate, high education levels and cultural commitment to providing work for those who want it, downsizing in Japan will probably be far more gentle than it was in the United States.
 
Howling Over the Yen
Already, as Japanese companies find themselves stretched by the traditional pay system in which workers are paid based on seniority and regardless of skills and performance, longtime benefits like low-interest loans and transportation costs are being slashed. Some companies are even scrapping the seniority-based pay system and moving toward merit-based systems.
As for the yen, there is more than a little self-interest in the howling from Washington and other nations for its recovery. Japanese companies benefit from the yen's decline because their products become cheaper, which hurts their foreign rivals. And improved sales by Japanese companies are good for the Japanese economy, which after all is what the world is pressing for. A healthier economy means a stronger yen, a stronger Asia and less threat to America and Europe.
Nonetheless, Mr. Asher, for one, wonders if Japan is willing to swallow all these pills, and if the rest of the world wants them to, knowing of the short-term consequences for the global economy. "One cannot help but worry whether both the Japanese themselves and the world around Japan are willing to accept two to three more bad years while Japan reorients itself," he said.

As the Fed Points Out, History Doesn't Lie

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Will today's easy-money atmosphere at American banks lead to hard times tomorrow?
Yes, if the past is prologue. Whenever lenders go from tough guys to E-Z Credit "R" Us, loan losses are almost inevitable. 
 With the economy perking, lenders are the life of the party. "Banks always manage for the up part of the cycle, not the whole cycle," said Charles Peabody, bank analyst at Mitchell Securities in New York.
Bank-stock bulls seem to think the industry is no longer cyclical. As a result, shares are trading at historic premiums to book value. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange bank index -- composed of 24 of the nation's largest money center and regional banks -- is up 16 percent this year. Over the last twelve months, the index has gained 33 percent, beating the 27 percent rise of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But a letter that the Federal Reserve Board sent to the nation's commercial banks last month indicates that in this regard, at least, the Fed is not ready to toss traditional standards into history's ashcan.
The letter, written by Richard Spillenkothen, director of banking supervision, isn't alarmist. But because it details the results of an extensive Fed review of bank asset quality and credit standards, it makes surprisingly interesting reading.
In comparing loans made in 1995 with those made last year, the Fed found that intense competition for loan customers had led to a significant relaxation of lending standards. That hasn't resulted in ugly problems, the Fed said, because of the robust economy -- a caveat made more pointed by reports last week that manufacturing activity had slowed in June for the first time in almost two years.
Indeed, ugly may come sooner, not later, if some of the lending practices identified by the Fed are commonplace. Only 20 to 30 percent of the several hundred loans reviewed showed any attempt by lenders to project how a borrower might perform in an economic downturn. In nearly half the loans, approval documents did not describe key financial covenants -- thresholds in financial performance that a borrower must meet -- that might lead to protective action by a bank before a loan goes belly-up. "Management may be inadequately informed as to the risks" associated with loans, the Fed wrote. Another concern was the rapid growth in loans to real estate investment trusts. Although these loans are now sound, the Fed warned that they might represent concentrated credit risk at banks.
Singling out REIT's, Mr. Peabody said, may be a concession to Fed members worried that rocketing real estate prices are one of the wealth effects of an overheated stock market. He thinks a schism may be developing inside the Fed. In May's Open Market Committee meeting, William Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed, and Jerry Jordan, president of the Cleveland bank, dissented from the decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Arguing for a tighter monetary policy, Mr. Jordan cited asset price inflation as a main concern.
Mr. Peabody finds this intriguing, because schisms within the Fed are unusual. There was a similar divergence on policy between regional Fed banks and their Washington counterparts in 1928. The regional members wanted to raise rates, Washington did not.
The split made headlines in March 1929, giving a jolt to stock prices. They recovered, but what happened later that year is, as they say, history.

In Black, And No Place To Hide

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Hayt 

 BODY:
IT was a female disaster of the first order, up there with meeting someone really cute and realizing you have lipstick on your front teeth. Invited to the Museum of Modern Art's "Party in the Garden," one of the last blowouts on the spring black-tie calendar, I decided to try my gown on ahead of time to check the fit.
It was a very clingy number from three seasons past. But the dress, once fashionably sexy, seemed badly out of date. Unlike this year's sheaths that discretely skim the body, my hip-hugging, low-cut design left nothing to the imagination. 
 In a panic, and with only nine hours to go before the party, I raced to Bergdorf Goodman, arriving just as the store opened at 10 A.M. I bolted to the escalator and landed at the Chanel boutique, a safe haven for the fashionable in desperate straits.
And as if the deity of good taste was smiling on me, the perfect little black dress appeared before my eyes. It was a variation on Audrey Hepburn's gown in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," made of wool crepe with slender straps and a trumpet-flared skirt. It not only fit to a T, but was also on sale.
I sashayed into the museum that night with utter confidence, a green cashmere sweater over my shoulders for an added touch of oh-so-trendy nonchalance. But as the air kisses started to fly, my self-assurance suddenly cracked. All around were radiant young women in sugary-colored, diaphanous confections, the antitheses of my little black look. You could practically hear the "oohs" and "ahs" around the 20-something sisters Jane Lauder and Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer, both in Oscar de la Renta chiffon creations. Aerin was a portrait in lemon yellow; Jane, in yellow and hot pink.
I felt like a black hole in a galaxy of bright young sparklers. The little black dress, I realized, might be suffering the same fate of many great stars, collapsing under the weight of its own history. Nearly 75 years after it was first introduced by Coco Chanel -- a style that Vogue predicted would become the Ford of fashion -- the little black dress is nothing more than a basic Ford Taurus. Even though my dress was Chanel, without a color or even a camellia to set it apart, it might as well have been from the mall.
"The black dress is gone," Samantha Boardman, a medical student who wore a knockout lavender Versace dress that night, told me a few days later. "You do get buried in black. You can disappear in it. You are anonymous in it."
Margaret Walch, director of the Color Association of the United States, which tracks color trends, put it succinctly: "Black is like Perrier, which did itself in."
Certainly the color issue has flip-flopped since the last time I dressed up. Hothouse tones used to be a sure sign that either a tourist or an aging socialite was on the loose. But these days, festive evening finery is neither provincial nor passe. Like their mothers before them, a younger generation of trend-setting social women are now decked out in rainbow hues, infusing color with new cachet.
"For evening clothes, there has been a change," said Brooke de Ocampo, 31, an associate at Sotheby's and a chairwoman of the New York Botanical Garden's junior fund-raising committee. "For day, there's still a black T-shirt and khaki clam diggers. But when I think of the last five black-tie events I've been to, I can't think of any black dresses."
Clearly, I don't get out enough.
But I do read fashion magazines, and it is true that there hasn't been a black evening gown on the cover of Vogue, W or Harper's Bazaar in at least six months. At Bergdorf, I later discovered, there was a full selection of black Versace and Armani gowns on sale, but the colorful Oscar de la Renta racks had been picked clean.
Like the appearance of Christian Lacroix's pouf dress of 1987, the last high point of conspicuous consumption before the current pecuniary frenzy, this season's fashion extravaganzas seem an expression of the bubbly economy.
"With the rebirth of parties and festivities, our generation is enjoying the glamour of dressing up," Ms. de Ocampo said. "Black does wonders for everybody, but it doesn't require much thought. You tend to put on a color, it shows more imagination and courage."
Goodness. Now my black dress was not only out of style, but also a sign that I lacked guts. And all along I had thought that black was a statement of female strength. It is no coincidence that the black dress first emerged in the 1920's after the suffragist movement won women the vote. Again in the 80's, as women ascended the corporate ladder, black dresses were on the rise, their popularity soaring in this decade.
"For the past 10 to 12 years, you've had the 'Armani' phenomenon, not that he isn't a wonderful designer," Mr. de la Renta, the longtime standard-bearer of color, told me. "When a professional woman wanted to dress, she wanted to be taken seriously, which meant not being noticed. Black is the least memorable color. Women have outgrown all that. There is a whole new generation of girls dressing in a pretty manner."
Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer, director of creative product development for Estee Lauder, called the recent explosion of color a reaction against years of androgyny. "People are maxed out on minimalism," she said. "They are looking for something feminine. Floral fragrances and fabrics are popular. Pink chiffon, pink lipstick, high heels and long hair are back."
As color returns, the daughters of the ladies who lunch have rediscovered their mothers' favorite designers -- namely, Mr. de la Renta, Bill Blass and Carolina Herrara, longtime devotees of a luscious palette and feminine styles. "For nighttime, Oscar and Bill have very sleek and sexy things for me, as well as things that would appeal to my mom," Ms. de Ocampo said. "They'll do something in a silk jersey, which is a sort of semi-retro Halston look that has a certain moderness appealing to our age."
In turn, Mr. de la Renta, Mr. Blass and Ms. Herrara are taking a cue from their younger customers, particularly those who are family members. "My sister, Carolina Jr., is my mother's muse," said Patricia Herrara, 24, a daughter of Carolina Herrara. "Her designs haven't exactly changed, but the fabrics are more fluid and there's no more hard construction, which gives them a younger look."
Mr. de la Renta acknowledged the influence of his 29-year-old stepdaughter, Eliza Reed. "Eliza is very feminine, and she influences my eye," he said. "She has so many young friends, and they all wear my clothes. I have these young customers, and I am thinking of them. They're a whole new consumer and a very important one."
Still, not everyone is convinced of the rightness of pink, nint green and baby blue after dark. "All these women who are wearing these sherbety colors, they're going to splash something like summer strawberries on their light-colored dresses or look in the mirror and say, 'Oh my God, I look so fat,' " Amy Edelman, author of "The Little Black Dress," said. "Color is a blip in fashion history. There's been 'death to black' before, but the black dress will never go away."
I, for one, am glad to hear it. Because even though my Chanel dress was 40 percent off, it cost plenty. I can justify the price as an investment in a classic. But the best way to get my money's worth, I figure, is to wear it to death.

A Flexing Of Muscle In American Steel

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
PRODUCTION at American steel companies is booming, with the mills cranking out tonnages not seen in decades. Manufacturers are building new plants using new technology and methods that produce efficiencies never dreamed of in the factories that once stood in places like Pittsburgh and Youngstown, Ohio, and still symbolize the industry's rust-belt image for many people.
Last year, mills in the United States produced 107.5 million tons of raw steel, a 22.3 percent increase over 1991, the low point of the decade, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group. 
 Production is expected to be as good or better this year, and the outlook for the next few years is promising, too, with a peak of 110 million tons expected in 2001, according to a survey conducted by Locker Associates, a steel consulting firm.
The sector of the industry that makes steel by melting scrap -- rather than treating ore in the standard old-fashioned blast furnace -- has been gaining market share, accounting for 46.4 percent of total production last year, up from the mid-30 percent range early in the decade. Its share is eventually expected to exceed 50 percent.
The scrap-based operations were once known as mini-mills, but they are not so mini anymore. Indeed, if the mini-mill leader, the Nucor Corporation, proceeds with planned and expected expansions, it will emerge as the largest steel producer in the country, eclipsing the USX Corporation.
Lately, though, the steel industry has encountered some speed bumps, and it faces the possibility of longer-term problems.
The strike at the General Motors Corporation is cutting demand for high-quality sheet steel, the principal product of the remaining integrated companies -- those that make steel from raw materials forward, using blast furnaces to process iron ore.
Power shortages in the Midwest are affecting scrap-based companies, which use electric furnaces that require vast amounts of power to liquefy scrap.
Overshadowing the industry are the economic problems in Asia and the weakening of Asian currencies, which has made Asian steel cheaper to buy. The fear is that if large amounts of steel at low prices flood this country, domestic producers will cut prices, hurting profits.
Nevertheless, the steel industry is vastly different now than it was in the 1980's, when mills deemed obsolete were closed, throwing tens of thousands of people out of work.
Because of the impurities in scrap, older steel companies thought the mini-mills could never produce the high-quality sheet steel used in appliances and interior car parts. Nucor proved them wrong with its plant in Crawfordsville, Ind., in 1989.
Today, the former general manager of that plant, Keith E. Busse, and some of those who worked with him there are no longer part of Nucor. They are the top executives of Steel Dynamics Inc., the fastest-growing company in the industry.
To further improve quality and to help protect themselves against rising scrap prices, many scrap-based companies are developing methods of separating iron from ore without using a blast furnace. (Steel is iron with a small percentage of carbon and other additives.)
The integrated companies, meanwhile, are using the symbol of their old ways, the blast furnace, to retain key customers, like makers of the exterior parts of automobiles and light trucks. Because they work with raw materials, these companies can more closely control the chemistry and metallurgy of their products.
Their newer methods have produced lighter, stronger types of steel. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which helped build the Golden Gate Bridge and 1,100 World War II ships, is now known for products that were not even made 10 years ago, like ultra-light sheet steel for auto bodies. Steel scientists have calculated that if the 24-year-old Sears Tower in Chicago were erected today, it would require 35 percent less steel because of advances in steel strength.
These improvements have made foreign auto makers that assemble cars in this country, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota, Honda and Nissan, happy to use locally produced steel, avoiding the expense of importing it from home.. Some studies show that American steel mills have lower costs than those in Germany and Japan.
The lower costs are a result of improvements in productivity in the American steel industry. One key measure is the amount of labor needed to manufacture a ton of steel. The industry has more than doubled labor productivity, to 3.59 hours of employee work per ton in 1995, the last year for which figures are available, from 10.1 in 1982.
But this understates what has happened. Some new scrap-based mills are so automated they can make a ton of steel with less than a half-hour of a worker's labor.
All of this said, there does not seem to be much money to be made by investing in steel stocks, at least at this time. Many are currently trading near their 52-week lows, with little to excite buying interest.
Even Bethlehem Steel, considered a model industrial comeback story, has suffered recently. Its stock, which doubled in value from January to April, has since fallen more than 20 percent, to trade at the $12.75 to $13 level.
"Asia is the biggest wild card out there," said Robert Schenosky, a metals analyst with Merrill Lynch. He said prices of steel produced in Asia are looking increasingly attractive to potential buyers in the United States, putting pressure on domestic steelmakers.
Eventually, the stocks will be cheap enough to create trading opportunities, but that point hasn't arrived. "The market dynamics are very difficult for steel stocks," Mr. Schenosky said. "Not all the bad news has been built into steel stock prices yet."
Steel imports have already begun to climb. R. Wayne Atwell, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said imports rose 21 percent in April after falling in the first three months of the year.
He sees an exception to the pessimistic near-term outlook for steel stocks in Steel Dynamics, which began commercial operations in January 1996. It is increasing production capacity to 2.4 million tons a year from 1.4 million tons, and is adding higher-priced offerings.
Steel Dynamics shares have fallen sharply on expectations of weak second-quarter earnings. This last week they reached a low for the year of $13.75, off 57 percent from their 1998 high of $23.375 on April 15, closing the week $14.125.
Mr. Atwell said the company's problems were temporary and "the price more than discounts the likely earnings disappointment."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CROWN HEIGHTS;
A Library for Toy Therapy

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER 

 BODY:
Parents are forever trying to teach their children that sharing toys is good.
But such generosity can also yield health benefits. So a Cobble Hill couple are founding one of the region's few toy libraries, to help ill infants who are economically disadvantaged. 
 Pauline's Library is to open as part of the Infant and Child Learning Center at Kings County Hospital in August. It is named for Pauline Lazar, who died in March, one day shy of 10 months, as a result of hypotonia, or low muscle tone. The condition is also known as "floppy baby" syndrome.
"It becomes apparent that you need a lot of stuff," said Paul Lazar, an actor, of his daughter's therapeutic regimen. (His wife asked that her name not be used.) And ordinary toys, it turns out, are among the most helpful. To give Pauline an incentive to lift her arms, for example, Pauline's therapist, Jean MacKenzie, prescribed one of those arches under which babies lie and grab for dangling goodies.
Though Pauline was a patient at Long Island College Hospital and Ms. MacKenzie treated her at home, she has a day job at Kings County. The Lazars were full of questions about families dealing with hypotonia, said Ms. MacKenzie, who explained that many of the patients were inner-city children whose families didn't have the money to buy appropriate toys.
"So when everything happened with Pauline," the therapist said, "they asked if we would be open to accepting donations."
The Lazars posted fliers at their synagogue and in stores in downtown Brooklyn asking for "new and gently used" baby toys, and got a good response. The couple plan to pick up the toys themselves to keep costs down, and to wash the toys once a week at the library, which will also serve children with disabilities besides hypotonia. (Those interested may call 718 245-3296 to donate toys, time or money.)
The Lazars expect that Pauline's Library will be the largest of its kind in New York City. One of the few others, run by United Cerebral Palsy, is on Lawrence Avenue off Ocean Parkway in Borough Park.
New York City is completely without a nontherapeutic toy library that can be used by the general population. The chief obstacle, New York librarians say, is fear of germs and lawyers.
Such libraries are common in Europe and elsewhere in the United States. Membership toy libraries have been operating for decades in Washington and Pittsburgh, and a few public libraries on Long Island and in Connecticut circulate toys as well as books. ERIC HUBLER

HEADLINE: The World: Searching for Tibet;
The Shangri-La That Never Was

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
IN 1888 an American diplomat-turned-adventurer named William Woodville Rockhill set out to explore Tibet, a territory he described in his journal as "a very imperfectly known portion of the Chinese Empire." It still is.
When President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China engaged in a public exchange on the subject last week, they spoke for two diametrically opposed lobbies. One, drawing on a largely Western vision of Tibet, sees a Himalayan Shangri-la waiting to be freed from beneath the Chinese boot. The other imagines a territory rescued from a dark and brutal theocracy by a modernizing government in Beijing. 
 Neither perception, most scholars say, accurately reflects the unique culture that flourished, and still struggles to survive, on the high-altitude Tibetan plateau.
Tibet, a nation that produced one of the world's great medieval empires, striking fear in enemies from Central Asia to the heart of China in the eighth century, did not later develop into a modern, ultimately industrialized nation-state as its counterparts in Europe did. Nor did it sink into the long decline of once-great Islamic civilizations. It became instead a demilitarized, decentralized, isolated country in the shadow of Mongolian and Manchu rulers but dominated by its Buddhist monasteries and lama-kings trying to rule over a collection of quarreling sects. Some of the more hot-headed followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, now blame the religious powers who disarmed the country for its weakness in the face of Chinese might.
Tibet had all but disappeared for a thousand years before 19th-century explorers cajoled their way to Lhasa, the capital. Their heirs are the seekers of the late 20th century, who have mined Tibet, or perhaps an imagined Tibet, for its nonviolence, spirituality, meditative arts and herbal medicines. Many, spurred by Hollywood's recent films on the subject, have found a cause in the exiled 14th Dalai Lama, driven from his sanctuary in Lhasa by the advancing Chinese Army in 1959.
But by the time the Dalai Lama was arriving in India, another school of thought had seized the imagination of influential intellectuals. Promoted by Beijing and by Westerners who became enamored of Mao Zedong's 1949 revolution, the new vision served to justify the Chinese invasion of Tibet that followed by painting the Tibetan monastic leadership as feudal, oppressive and living on the backs of serfs.
 
Monastic Fiefs
Searching for historical analogies, the revisionists fell back on familiar European themes, said Christopher I. Beckwith of Indiana University, a linguist and historian of Tibet and China. Friends of China could also draw on accounts -- including Rockhill's -- of slavery and bonded labor, of vast, corrupt monastic fiefs and abbots who were likely to steal horses. Tibetan monasteries were usually -- and many still are -- breathtakingly filthy, occasionally ramshackle places where a traveler may find the iconography fascinating but the welcome pretty thin, if not hostile, and the monks less than industrious at any pursuit.
"Sure, Tibet was no paradise, then or now," Professor Beckwith said. "But it certainly wasn't anything like the image, which was directly taken from Western medievalist views of medieval Europe. That's almost a classicist view: When the classical world fell, there was darkness and barbarians crawling around on the ground gnawing bones."
Robert A. F. Thurman of Columbia University, a professor and former Buddhist monk who is considered the leading American expert on Tibetan Buddhism, said the movement to relegate Tibet to the Dark Ages was a byproduct of hearts broken by Stalin.
"When Russian writers began to write about what a monster he was, leftist writers and journalists in the West sat down and conspired, basically," he said. "They said: 'Look, the international movement, the idealistic movement, is going to the dogs and there is no example of any decent thing that's happened because of socialism or communism, and Mao may be the one who is going to do it right.' "
Westerners who glossed over the violence perpetrated on Tibet by the Chinese, Professor Thurman said, also invoked anti-papal sentiments of Northern European Protestants. "They basically presented the Tibetans as kind of Catholics," he said. "They had red robes, they had lush rituals. To the Protestant-minded European population, it was perfect to align them with the corrupt Borgias -- princes of the church in all their horrible debauchery and murder and intrigue."
Scholars of Tibet mostly agree that there has been no systematic serfdom in Tibet in centuries. The label was again a Eurocentric one. In 1879, an Indian scholar who had spent his life in the Himalayan area, Sarat Chandra Das, traveled to Lhasa and studied the social order. He found no trace of bonded servitude. He described a place (unlike caste-ridden India) where "the rich may bestow their daughters on the poor; the daughter of a poor man may become the bride of the proudest noble in the country."
But if Tibet's detractors operate on politically inspired myths, the champions of Tibetan independence also have their fantasies. The country was underdeveloped, its people often rapacious and warlike. Tibetan Buddhism is a robust, earthy religion, far less philosophical and pacifist than many of its Western practitioners would like to believe.
 
The Nonviolence Myth
"There is a Buddhist theory of war, of self-defense, and there is also a kind of theory of surgical violence," Professor Thurman said. "The optimal, ideal thing is nonviolence. But sometimes you have to do a little violence to prevent a larger violence. The Buddhists have thought about this and they are not simplistic."
Moreover, Buddhism has not inevitably made the societies it dominates nonviolent. Monks in Sri Lanka have joined or supported extreme Sinhalese nationalists who murdered thousands of "class enemies" in the 1980's. Cambodia's Buddhist society produced the Khmer Rouge. A nominally Buddhist military junta rules Burma.
Geoff Childs, a Tibetan-speaking anthropologist who recently spent a year living in a Tibetan Buddhist village just over the border in Nepal, said romantics in search of otherworldliness often failed to notice the powerful role of economics in religion among Tibetans, who must survive a harsh environment.
His village, 12,000 feet high on the Tibetan plateau, was dominated by lamas -- married men, not celibate monks -- who believed they had inherited their place in society from the last Tibetan emperors. That gave them spiritual and social influence. But they had turned their high prestige into economic advantage. In return for blessing houses, families and livestock, they were repaid in goods or labor, allowing them to prosper at the expense of their spiritual charges.
Because Tibet has been studied mostly by religious specialists, Mr. Childs said, Westerners have lost the ability to look at it pragmatically.
"It's annoying that people want to make it into one thing or another -- it's a Shangri-la, or it's a depraved place," said Professor Beckwith of Indiana University. "It was a normal country. It was a real culture. It still is, though unfortunately in a sad state now. It had everything from human virtue down to the depths of depravity."
Kesang Tseten, a Tibetan writer living in Katmandu, said some Tibetan exiles have begun to complain that the reality of their life has been overtaken by Hollywood. "It's true Tibet has been imbued by Western imaginations of the subject," he said. "Does this mean we're going to be bound by how others see us?" Not, he said, if Tibetans themselves "get a little real."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
As Stocks Teeter, a Safe Harbor May Be Found in Corporate Bonds

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
LIKE sailors flocking to safe ports, mutual fund investors have long turned to bonds whenever stocks appear dangerously close to imploding.
But what are the nervous to do when the safest bonds around -- benchmark Treasuries -- have soared in price? 
 Concerns about Asia's fractured economic machine have caused investors -- especially those overseas -- to pull money out of certain stock and bond markets and pour it into United States Treasury bonds. So prices have risen and yields -- which move in the opposite direction of prices -- have sunk to 30-year lows. As of June 30, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was just 5.62 percent, compared with 6.78 percent one year ago.
The safety-conscious as well as the yield-hungry investor cannot help but wonder if it's time to forage elsewhere. And if so, where?
Funds that invest in corporate bonds, it turns out, may carry the most value now. These bonds pay a higher yield than Treasury securities because the risk of corporate default, of course, is greater than that of a default by the United States Government. The yield spread between corporate and Treasury bonds is the widest it has been in five years and, given the economy's strength, the risk of default seems limited for investment-grade bonds. With inflation low, the yields look quite nice.
What's more, companies have issued a mountain of new debt, taking advantage of low rates to finance capital improvements and to refinance older debt. That has left the market flooded and helped keep prices down -- a situation that, in correcting itself over time, is likely to benefit bond investors.
The big risk is the economy. Potential buyers have been worried that corporate earnings are on the verge of a long snooze. If earnings decline, the prices of corporate bonds will fall, too, leading to lower total returns, even if dividends stay steady.
Oversupply is also a problem in the municipal bond market, which has been second after Treasuries in investor safety. To be sure, after an uninspiring first four months of the year, munis rallied in May, as stocks stumbled and as investors snapped up the first half of the largest muni bond sale ever -- $7 billion in Long Island Power Authority bonds. Demand for these bonds, and their unusually rich yields, effectively drained money from other munis.
The glut remains a problem, with more issues on the way.
Still, for high-income investors looking for the best returns after taxes, municipal bonds may be the way to go. There has been a solid improvement in credit quality: Half as many issues were downgraded in 1997 as in 1996. The good news can be attributed to the booming economy and a surge in local tax revenues.
Also, in the last year, yields on municipal bonds, relative to taxable bonds, have narrowed significantly. According to Richard J. Moynihan, head of tax-exempt fixed-income investing at the Dreyfus Corporation, the typical insured 20-year muni gives investors 91 percent of the yield of a 30-year Treasury bond, up from about 81 percent a year ago.
For people in a 31 percent income tax bracket, "that's roughly equal to the 7.50 percent yield they might get with a taxable security," he said. "And there aren't too many triple A-rated securities on the taxable side that return 7.50 percent."
The downside, however, is that munis are less likely to appreciate, so their total return may be weak.
FOR investors in munis, he recommends longer-term issues. "When it comes to short-term munis -- say five-year issues -- the market is fully priced relative to Treasuries," he said. "Beyond that -- going out 10 years or more -- then these bonds continue to be very cheap relative to Treasuries."
Investors who bought the longest-term issues were rewarded last quarter. The best-performing bond funds had long maturities, including the American Century-Benham Target Maturity funds, several Vanguard long-term funds and T. Rowe Price U.S. Treasury Long-Term.
What about investors who are looking for even better values than corporate and muni issues, as well as potentially higher yields? Les Nanberg, the chief fixed-income officer at Massachusetts Financial Services, says the best opportunities are in high-yield junk bonds and emerging-market bonds, not surprisingly the riskiest areas of the bond world.
He says yields on junk bonds are now 3.5 percentage points more than Treasuries, on average, while emerging-market bonds average about 6.5 percentage points more.
After registering nifty price gains for months, junk bonds are now trading at two-year lows. Funds that invest in junk bonds posted a slight loss on average in the last quarter.
But the news was worse for most emerging-market bond funds. On average, they lost more than 8 percent in the latest quarter, according to Morningstar. Among the bottom performers were Phoenix B Emerging Markets Bond and Merrill Lynch American Income. "If investors can live with the volatility of these bonds, they'll be rewarded," Mr. Nanberg said, "although they're clearly not for everyone." Anticipating more volatility, he is shying away from most of Asia but spots value in Poland, Bulgaria, and other Eastern European countries, as well as Mexico.
What about junk bonds? Again, Mr. Nanberg is treading carefully, focusing on companies that meet at least one of three criteria: they are leaders in their industries, are benefiting from a strong economy or are benefiting from recent acquisitions. One company that he expects to benefit from the strong economy is BE Aerospace, which makes replacement parts for aircraft.
Roger E. King, a senior portfolio manager for high-yield securities at Dreyfus, says the news on the high-yield front isn't all bad.
"Right now, there are no panic sellers," Mr. King said, "so we're in a kind of controlled downturn."
That said, Mr. King advises investors to choose issues with very short maturities, to guard against changes in interest rates and the junk market's current volatility.
Indeed, the greatest risk in bonds today may be credit risk, said John F. Poole, the head of fixed-income group at Mellon Private Asset Management. "We don't think the economy is about to collapse," he added, "but we think that individual companies may be at risk."

Three Strategies, One Outcome: A Spring That Came Up Roses

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
IT was a bitter spring quarter for many a mutual fund manager, but it was a very sweet season for others. How did some managers land at the top of the fund performance lists? Different tacks worked well for different managers. 
 Here, some of the winners talk about their strategies -- from short-selling to big bets on technology and European stocks -- as well as their outlooks for the rest of the year.
 
Short-Selling Panache
Michael B. Orkin, manager of Caldwell & Orkin Market Opportunity, might be called Mr. Doom-and-Gloom. His fund, based in Atlanta, landed the No. 12 position on the list of best-performing United States diversified funds in the second quarter, with a 10.1 percent return. Much of that is attributable to Mr. Orkin's short-selling, which involves betting on a decline, rather than an increase, in the price of a stock.
In a short sale, investors sell shares that they have borrowed from a broker, betting that they can replace the stock at a lower price. Mr. Orkin has benefited so much from the practice that he plans to raise the 40 percent cap on short positions in his fund to 50 or 55 percent.
"I believe eventually the stock market will have a significant and long-lasting setback," Mr. Orkin said. "I'm talking about bear markets that happen once in a generation."
Why so downbeat? Mr. Orkin faxed a reporter a 10-page missive to explain his reasoning. The gist of it? "People don't believe the markets can drop," he said. "Massive complacency is becoming firmly established."
Mr. Orkin's solution is to mix stock purchases with short sales. "The criteria for both is we look for change; an acceleration in earnings growth; management change, usually correlated with restructuring, or industry changes like supply or demand for semiconductor chips or oil exploration and development," he said.
A long position, Ames Department Stores, which rose 24.6 percent, helped his second-quarter return. Mr. Orkin calls Ames, which accounts for 1.9 percent of the $247.1 million fund, "a discount retailer that's executing its strategy well."
Ames emerged from bankruptcy, reorganized under new management and is faring well because economic growth has left consumers with money to spend, he said. Ames sells for 16 times 1998 earnings, which analysts expect to grow 15 to 20 percent a year.
Mr. Orkin declined to name companies that the fund is shorting but said he was playing two themes: companies with exposure to Asia and companies that offer subprime loans.
The minimum investment for the fund was just raised to $100,000, from $10,000.
 
Technology Mainstays
Big technology bets did the trick for the Janus 20 portfolio, which, as its name implies, holds just 20 stocks. The fund is managed by Scott W. Schoelzel, who took over when Thomas F. Marsico left Janus Capital to open his own shop in January.
Dell Computer, which surged 37 percent in the second quarter, helped push Janus 20 up to first place for the quarter among diversified funds, and Mr. Schoelzel remains bullish on the company: It now accounts for 8 percent of the fund.
"I like the systemic advantage that they enjoy from their direct-sales model," Mr. Schoelzel said. "The company also has negative working capital, because they get their customers' money immediately but they don't have to pay their suppliers for 60 to 90 days."
And Mr. Schoelzel is also excited about the fact that Dell is moving into selling higher-margin servers and notebook computers.
America Online, which ran up 53.9 percent, also played a big part in the outperformance of Janus 20. It accounts for 6 percent of the fund.
"I like America Online because of the rate at which it's signing up subscribers, advertisers and E-commerce partners," Mr. Schoelzel said.
The company has also been able to increase some of its advertising rates, which Mr. Schoelzel said would help drive up America Online earnings more than expected.
Mr. Schoelzel's winners weren't all of the wired variety. Home Depot, at 3 percent of the fund, rose 22.8 percent in the second quarter.
"Besides the large stores, Home Depot is on the verge of rolling out Expo stores, a high-end format for clients of designers and architects," he said.
Mr. Schoelzel remains bullish on the stock market.
"I believe we're in a secularly declining inflation environment and, as a result, a fairly benign interest rate environment," he said. "The move in financial assets has many years to run."
 
Loyal to Europe
A love affair with Europe landed the $420.8 million Federated International Small Company fund, managed by Tracy P. Stouffer, in third place on the list of diversified international stock funds for the second quarter. The fund returned 10.5 percent.
Ms. Stouffer's charter is flexible. She must only stick with companies with capitalizations of $1 billion or less and stay outside the United States.
Last year, 35 percent of the fund was invested in emerging markets. This year, the total is zero, which, of course, served her well as those markets swooned. The fund's holdings in Europe teeter at 96 percent.
Much of this mix, or lack thereof, has to do with Ms. Stouffer's mandate to hold small-capitalization stocks, which are suffering mightily outside of developed nations. "We're not getting any small-cap effect in emerging markets because all the companies are becoming smaller and smaller, the result of shrinking prices and currency erosion," she said.
European small-cap stocks have thrived, Ms. Stouffer said, because of a general flight to smaller-sized companies in reaction to the Asian problems. "Small companies tend to do business locally, so they're somewhat of a safe haven," she said.
They also tend to have low levels of debt, if for no other reason than that few lenders will give them loans. Moreover, they are benefiting from a trend toward outsourcing among big companies of their noncore businesses, she said.
Ms. Stouffer plans to stay invested in Europe for now. "I don't think it's time to move into the emerging markets," she said. "I don't think the Asia problems will be resolved quickly, and small companies are beneficiaries of European growth and the E.M.U.," she added, referring to European Monetary Union.
The fund holds 185 companies. Among the largest, all well under 2 percent of the fund's assets, are Cofir, a Spanish holding company with hotel and wine businesses; Creyf's, a temporary employment company in Belgium, and Telepizza, a Spanish pizza delivery chain.

The Cafe Police Pop In for a Raid

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
Surprise inspections at four popular East Village nightclubs last weekend have upset several club owners, who accuse officials of unfairly targeting them and driving away customers.
The inspections, around midnight last Saturday, were carried out by the Social Club Task Force, which includes representatives from the Police and Fire Departments, the State Liquor Authority and other state and city agencies. 
 About 30 officials entered the Continental, on Third Avenue; CBGB's, on the Bowery; the Bowery Bar, and Coney Island High, on St. Marks Place. A co-owner of Coney Island High, Jesse Malin, said the official carried flashlights, asked for music to be turned off and would not allow anyone to enter the club. "The whole thing was very Gestapo-like," he said. "They were looking for drugs, fire violations, fruit flies in the liquor, everything, but they found nothing."
After a 45-minute inspection, no violations were issued at his club, Mr. Malin said. At Continental, task force members issued one violation, for garbage in a sink, said the owner, who called himself Trigger. Bowery Bar received three citations, for an unlicensed bar, overcrowding and an exit blocked by a table, said the bar's general manager, Howard Schaffer. And at CBGB's, where a drag queen rock band was playing, several notices were issued, including one for having a bartender handle ice without a "food protection certificate" issued by the Health Department.
"I guess ice is now food," said a manager at CBGB's, Louise Parnassa.
None of the bars were closed down. The inspections were the second round in the neighborhood in recent weeks. On June 18, three bars and restaurants on Ludlow and Orchard Streets were visited by inspectors. One, Baby Jupiter's, on Orchard Street, was cited for serving alcohol to a minor but was allowed to stay open, said the owner, Gary Auslander.
In April, task force officials temporarily closed four bars on the Upper East Side after complaints about noise prompted inspections that uncovered health and fire code violations. At the time, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, the task force chairman, said bars in Manhattan would be the major focus of this summer's inspections.
Mr. Washington was not available for comment last week, but the Mayor's office defended the task force. In a prepared statement, it said: "The task force targets social clubs in response to complaints from club customers and neighborhood residents as well as from intelligence developed from the New York City Police Department. Public safety is the paramount concern in these enforcement efforts."
Club officials said they understood the need for periodic inspections, but some were angered by their timing and manner. "I think they feel they have to give a violation, and if you're borderline you're getting it," said Mr. Schaffer of the Bowery Bar.
Mr. Malin estimated that the presence of the police officers drove away about 70 percent of his customers. "It was prime time for us to make our bread and butter," he said. "It cost me about $4,000."
The president of the New York Nightlife Association, Andrew Rasiej, said that he did not think that the task force had timed the inspections to disrupt business but that while "the nightlife industry is a $3 billion industry, it is unfortunately not seen as a component of the social and economic fabric of New York."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: THEATER DISTRICT -- RELATIONS;
At Lamb's Club, a Long-Running, Real-Life Drama

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
As many good dramas do, this tale blends love, loss and art, and involves a man and a woman. And, oh yes, one gloriously assembled pile of bricks.
The man in question is James M. Copeland, a soft-spoken Southern architect whose life was empty, he said, until he met the woman in question, Carolyn Rossi, a member of that brashest of New York professional castes, the theatrical producer. 
 The third player is the Lamb's Club, at 130 West 44th Street, the former actors' clubhouse designed by Stanford White and once frequented by the likes of John Barrymore, Fred Astaire and John Wayne.
As formidable as those legends are, few can claim a more personal connection with the building than Ms. Rossi and Mr. Copeland, who over the last 20 years have used No. 130 as a home, a wooing locale, a wedding hall and a place of grieving. And, of course, as a theater.
Our story begins in 1979, shortly after the club sold its building to the Church of the Nazarene. Ms. Rossi was just beginning to direct shows at the church, and soon began living in a tiny room on the sixth floor of the building with a collection of young actors, writers and other unemployed persons.
"My father thought I'd joined a cult," Ms. Rossi said. "He was horrified."
Enter Mr. Copeland, who had come to the big city from North Carolina to apprentice at an architectural firm. His employer was eyeing a renovation of the building, but Mr. Copeland's gaze had fallen on the quirky girl staying in the building's rafters.
"Where I come from, women are not aggressive," he said. "She was, and I kind of liked that."
Mr. Copeland began to visit Ms. Rossi at her office, situated on the third floor. Ms. Rossi was busy establishing the Lamb's Theater Company, which would reside in the club's third-floor theater until 1996. She enlisted him to sew curtains and cushions for the seats. Soon, he asked for her hand.
Their wedding, on April 24, 1982, was held in the theater between the matinee and evening performances of "Cottonpatch Gospel," the Lamb's Theater Company's first production. Ms. Rossi had dogwoods flown in from North Carolina, and dropped an especially frilly curtain in front of the set.
"Producing a wedding is just like producing a show," she said. "Only hopefully it lasts longer."
The marriage did last, and the shows continued, with some hits, some duds. And a newcomer took up residence on the building's sixth floor: Ms. Rossi's mother, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Over the next two years, the couple and the company's actors tended to Ms. Rossi Copeland's mother, visiting her and entertaining her with songs from their shows. In 1984, the mother died in her room, surrounded by family members, during the final chords of a performance in the theater below.
Over the next decade, Ms. Rossi Copeland continued to produce a steady stream of musicals and original plays at the space, giving the first performances of works by Horton Foote, Mark St. Germain and Randy Courts. Mr. Copeland, meanwhile, began to renovate the building, slowly restoring its fine wood panels and facade.
In 1996, Ms. Rossi Copeland decided to fold her company, choosing to spend more time with her own family in Garrison, N.Y., where she had been elected to the school board. It didn't take.
"You ever been to a school board meeting?" she said. "Being a producer is nothing compared to dealing with parents."
So this year, she has returned to the Lamb's Club, as the producer of "Smoke on the Mountain." And Mr. Copeland is considering another overhaul, this time to unearth the marble floors under the lobby's tile.
"I was married here, had my theater here, watched my mother die here," Ms. Rossi Copeland said. "I had so much life invested here. I couldn't really stay away." JESSE McKINLEY

HEADLINE: In America;
Ending A Retail Drought

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Big news: Last Tuesday a supermarket opened at the corner of Whalley Avenue and Orchard Street in New Haven.
Most Americans take supermarkets for granted. But they are rare phenomena in the chronically depressed neighborhoods of the inner cities. If you live in the ghetto and you want to shop for groceries, you will most likely pay extortionate prices for super-low quality and hardly any variety at small local stores. Or you will make your way somehow to the suburbs. 
 Imagine a large family with a small income, no car and little access to public transportation. I remember watching a woman in a bodega in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn ask the store owner if he had any peaches. He was reading a newspaper and never looked up. "No peach," he said.
So the 56,000-square-foot Shaw's supermarket that opened in New Haven was a huge deal. It anchors a shopping center that includes a bank branch and a video store. And it is the latest step in what appears to be a halting, tentative, wary but nevertheless very promising return of serious retail activity to such neighborhoods.
It is not happening in a vacuum. For years small neighborhood organizations, known as community development corporations, or C.D.C.'s, have been building or renovating housing that can be afforded by families of very modest means. This new housing has been a stabilizing influence in inner-city neighborhoods across the country, a defense against onrushing blight.
As the neighborhoods stabilize, new families are drawn to them, creating a viable potential market in areas that previously were economically moribund.
"The obvious next step is to take a look at where the families are going to shop," said P. Jefferson Armistead, a vice president with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (L.I.S.C.), a national organization that helps arrange funding and provides expert assistance to C.D.C.'s.
"The C.D.C.'s," said Mr. Armistead, "have set the stage for this additional phase of retail development."
This entire scenario is being played out with excruciating slowness. But there is reason to believe not only that it is working, but that in the current economic atmosphere, it will accelerate. There is serious money to be made in neighborhoods that once were viewed only as economic wastelands. As Mr. Armistead noted, the per capita income in such neighborhoods is low, but because of the population densities the income "per acre" can be very high.
"We are seeing some recognition on the part of big retail stores that there are substantial opportunities here," he said.
A Pathmark supermarket that opened in Newark's Central Ward in 1990 is one of the most successful in the entire Pathmark chain. It was the first supermarket built in the Central Ward since it was devastated by rioting in 1967.
Large-scale retail projects further stabilize a neighborhood, and they provide substantial employment opportunities. Each new supermarket represents 250 to 300 new jobs.
In the past few years shopping centers anchored by supermarkets have been built or are being built in South Central Los Angeles, on the South Side of Chicago, in Philadelphia and in Harlem. Several others are planned. In each case the projects have been developed in partnerships with C.D.C.'s.
The New Haven project was a $15 million venture sponsored by the Greater Dwight Development Corporation, which operates in the neighborhoods of Dwight, Edgewood and West River. An L.I.S.C. subsidiary is a supporter of the project, and the GE Capital Corporation is an investor.
Each attempt to build large-scale retail outlets in inner-city neighborhoods is a struggle. Private companies are still reluctant to make the initial investment and security continues to be a problem.
But the C.D.C.'s and intermediary organizations like L.I.S.C. have completed several successful projects and many more are planned. Each successful project is a magnet for others.
"This is not the whole economic answer," said Paul Grogan, the president of L.I.S.C. "But this return of the retail market represents a reconnection of these communities with the mainstream economy, and that hasn't been there for a long time. It's a very hopeful sign. It's something to build on."

ECONOMY
 
Confidence Is Not High . . .
The nation's manufacturers have slowed production to the lowest rate of growth since 1995, the clearest impact so far of the Asian crisis on the American economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity weakened in June for a majority of the companies that it surveys each month. It was the first time in 22 months that a majority had reported weakening instead of strengthening in their businesses. Manufacturing employment has fallen in recent months, and industrial production has slowed to an annual growth rate of less than 2 percent, down from 6 percent last year. Production is slowing in large part because stockpiles of unsold goods have surged, but also because companies are becoming worried that the economic boom cannot continue at the fervent pace of the last two years. Separately, the index of leading economic indicators was flat in May, a sign that growth will moderate in the coming months. 

. . . Except Among Consumers
Consumer confidence in the economy rose in June to a 29-year high, as Americans remained optimistic that the strong labor market and healthy economic growth would continue in coming months. The Conference Board, a private research group, reported that its index of consumer confidence rose to 137.6 in June from a revised 136.3 in May, a larger rise than Wall Street analysts had expected. That confidence was also reflected in sales of new homes, which rose in May to a record level. And the Fed helped matters down the road by leaving interest rates unchanged. New single-family home sales rose three-tenths of a percent in May to an annual rate of 890,000 units, the Commerce Department said, breaking the previous record set in April. Unfortunately, the percentage of homeowners who were late on their mortgage payments also rose in the first quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
 
GENERAL MOTORS
 
Stop-and-Go Manufacturing
The General Motors Corporation said June car and truck sales were the highest for any month in nine years but that July sales would plummet because of two strikes that have shut down most of the auto maker's North American assembly plants and idled almost 172,000 workers. Most other car makers also reported higher sales. A G.M. official said sales would drop 30 percent to 40 percent this month compared with sales from the month a year earlier because of the strikes. That would push G.M.'s market share to a record low of 25 percent and put G.M. behind the Ford Motor Company as the largest volume vehicle manufacturer in the United States. Already, analysts say the strikes at two plants in Flint, Mich., have cost G.M. $1.18 billion.
 
EUROPE
 
Cleaner Air, Costlier Cars
People in Europe's car-filled cities are likely to start breathing a little easier in the next few years because of tough new anti-pollution rules announced in Brussels by the 15-member European Union. The rules, which ban the use of leaded gasoline, require many car engines and all fuels to become cleaner by 2000. Even tougher standards will go into effect in 2005. With the changes, governments hope to cut as much as 70 percent of the pollutants in emissions from cars, which regularly foul the air in some of Europe's most beautiful city centers. The changes are expected to raise the prices of cars between $300 and $600 in the next two years. Car makers will need to invest some $65 billion to meet the new standards, according to European Union officials. The oil industry estimates it will cost $35 billion to put the program into effect. And surprise, surprise, most of the higher costs are expected to be passed on to consumers.
 
JAPAN
 
Bailing Out the Banks
The Government outlined a long-awaited "Total Plan" to clear away bad debts, estimated around $600 billion. The plan seems to be modeled on the United States' bailout of savings and loans in the 1980's and is intended to gradually shut down banks weakened by bad loans while keeping credit flowing to healthy corporate borrowers. Under the plan, insolvent banks will be managed by a new watchdog agency while a merger partner is sought. Bridge loans will be provided to corporate customers dependent on financing from the troubled banks. When no suitor can be found, the banks will be taken over by a state-funded holding company and then sold off or liquidated. Bad loans will be handed over to special institutions and good loans are to be transferred to healthy private banks. The process is to be completed within a maximum of five years and funded by taxpayer money.
 
RUSSIA
 
Balance of Payments, Indeed
Russia's legendarily ineffectual tax men stared down the nation's biggest and most powerful corporation last week, threatening to seize control of the company -- and its executives' dachas, yachts and other perks -- unless it paid billions of dollars in back taxes. To most everyone's amazement, the company, Gazprom, gave in and agreed to turn over 4.2 billion rubles ($675 million) in unpaid taxes by Monday and to start paying the Government about 4 billion rubles a month. Had President Boris N. Yeltsin grown a backbone in dealing with the oligarchs who control the economy here -- or had he staged a deft act of political theater? For the agreement does not merely force Gazprom, the world's largest petroleum company and Russia's biggest tax delinquent, to make good on its back taxes; it also requires the Government to pay Gazprom billions of rubles for oil and gas that Government agencies and state companies purchased but never paid for. By many estimates, the two sums amount to a wash.
 
GOLF
 
Mean and Green
Fore! New golf courses are opening in the United States at the rate of more than one a day, according to the current issue of Audubon magazine, and the more than 16,000 of them take up an area three times the size of Rhode Island. A major cost of golf courses -- both environmentally and bottom line -- involves the heavy use of pesticides and herbicides to keep those greens green. But some courses have found that sound ecology pays twice: The Old Westbury Golf and Country Club on Long Island, for example, spent $150,000 on chemicals in 1990. Today, largely thanks to organic fertilizers, it has cut that budget item to $8,000 a year and is much more user-friendly for both the birdies and those who covet them.
 
BUSINESS TRAVEL
 
Big Pricey Cities
Business executives living abroad may have become used to the astronomical prices they pay in Tokyo and Hong Kong, and maybe even in Beijing and Shanghai. But companies doing business in China for the first time might do a double take when their employees file their first expense statements from Dalian, the globe's ninth-most-expensive city for overseas workers -- and notably more costly than New York, ranked No. 21. According to Corporate Resources Group, a consulting firm based in Geneva, Asia still has seven of the world's 10 most expensive cities for foreign workers. For big savings on expenses, try Harare, Zimbabwe, which ranked at the bottom of the list.
 
JOBS
 
Burger Flippers, Take Note
The United States economy is showing signs of cooling. In June, unemployment edged up to 4.5 percent and job growth slowed. There were other signs of moderation, too. Total hours worked were virtually flat in June, a clear indication that the nation's output of goods and services is growing much more slowly than in recent quarters. And hourly pay rose by a mere penny, suggesting that wage inflation, while higher than a year ago, was not accelerating. The slowdown, however, is from an exceptionally torrid pace. As recently as a year ago, joblessness stood at 5 percent.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: A New Broom Needs a New Handle;
Welfare as We Know It Goes Incognito

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
WITH a wave of a wand and a mayoral proclamation, New York City's welfare system is vanishing. Job centers are replacing welfare offices. Financial planners are replacing caseworkers. And the entire bureaucracy is morphing into the Family Independence Administration.
In truth, the same workers still do business in the same buildings, but the city has been infected by a name-changing frenzy that has been sweeping the country. Massachusetts' Department of Public Welfare is now the Department of Transitional Assistance. Florida's welfare program is now the Work and Gain Economic Self-Sufficiency Program. And in two weeks, the American Public Welfare Association, a trade group that represents social service agencies, will officially shed the word welfare from its letterhead for the first time in 66 years. 
 In an era when work is prized and welfare disparaged, many state and local officials are scrubbing their programs and groups clean of words tainted, rightly or wrongly, by the sour smell of failure. As Liz Krueger, an advocate for the poor, said somewhat sadly: "We have made welfare a four-letter word in this country. Everyone is running as fast as they can away from it."
 
A Powerful Message
And as the new language of welfare seeps into public consciousness, it has caused some people to wonder what is behind the new names. Are they merely euphemisms for business as usual? Or do they illuminate a whole new world? In one sense, the names reflect a nation transformed by time limits for public charity and work requirements for those who receive it. They send a powerful message to the poor about the change in government expectations.
But these names are also meant to carry a politically potent message to voters who will never step into a welfare office but whose discontent with the status quo helped propel an overhaul in welfare policy. In this sense, the words underscore the desires of politicians and officialdom to project a perception of change -- even if little actually changes -- as they try to curry favor with the electorate.
"Is this a message to people on welfare? Yes," said Robert C. Lieberman, assistant professor of politics and public policy at Columbia University. "But my suspicion is that the naming of programs is directed more at voters, certainly on the part of the elected, who are choosing the way they want their policies to be read."
Mr. Lieberman recalled a similar name change in the 1960's when the Federal welfare program was called Aid to Dependent Children. Criticized for discouraging marriage by supporting only single mothers, Federal officials began providing help to couples. While the vast majority of checks continued to flow to single women, the name became Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
Thirty years later, public disapproval of the welfare mother whose children and grandchildren rely on public assistance helped persuade Congress to change the rules and the name again. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families was born. At the state level, Texas created the Workforce Commission to oversee its welfare programs. Michigan dubbed its welfare agency the Family Independence Agency. And Utah started calling its offices "employment centers" and its welfare recipients "job seekers."
"It's a shrewd kind of move," Mr. Lieberman said of the linguistic shift. "Who can be against personal responsibility or family independence or temporary assistance or any of these things?"
 
Change and Posturing
In New York City, where two more welfare offices were converted into job centers last week, the names encompass both radical change and political posturing. At the centers, poor people are told to look for jobs, not welfare, and to lean on relatives, not charity. The shift has resulted in a staggering change: While 60 percent of the people who walked in the door once ended up on welfare, now only about 10 percent land on the dole, the rest deciding to get by on their own.
"The new names send positive messages to clients and caseworkers that the world of welfare is changing in profound ways," said Elaine Ryan, a director of the American Public Welfare Association, which will soon be called the American Public Human Services Association to reflect a wider membership and revamped thinking.
 
How to Fish
Or as Adrianne Flemming, who runs the new job center in Brooklyn with her team of financial planners, likes to say: "In the welfare offices, we were handing out fish. In the job centers, we're teaching people how to fish."
But while Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proudly touts the conversion of welfare offices into job centers, he declines to say how many people actually leave those with jobs.
In fact, a draft memo included in a training manual for workers describes employment as a "secondary goal" at the job centers. The "primary goal," the memo says, is discouraging the poor from applying for public assistance.
Advocates for the poor say the whole naming process sounds suspiciously like sloganeering that will appeal to voters but help few welfare recipients find work.
"I can change my name to the division of workforce development, but if there are not enough jobs out there for the people who walk in my door, none of that matters," Ms. Krueger said. "Does it mean more poor people are getting jobs in New York City? I don't think so. It's a lot easier to change a name than to create jobs for people."
City officials insist, however, that finding jobs for the poor is still the program's primary goal. They vow it will be emphasized as New York transforms all 31 of its welfare offices into job centers over the next year. The new signs and letterhead are already on order.
But as the painters paint and the printers print, will no one mourn the passing of a familiar word? Gary Weeks, who headed the name change committee for the American Public Welfare Association, thinks not. He found little nostalgia among members who wanted a new look to reflect the growing importance of health services along with the shift in welfare thinking.
"I don't think we lost anything," said Mr. Weeks, who runs Oregon's welfare program.. "No one was on a soapbox for keeping the terminology."

HEADLINE: Albright Hugs Wary Tokyo Smarting From Beijing Trip

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 4

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright dropped by today on her way back from China to give Japan a reassuring hug and emphasize that the United States values its ties with Tokyo as much as ever.
But Ms. Albright, in addition to comments about the "unshakable friendship" between Japan and the United States, also prodded Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to take further steps to bolster the Japanese economy. 
 The mood in Japan is so doleful and insecure these days that many Japanese were hurt by President Clinton's decision to spend nine days in China without even a brief visit to Japan.
So Mr. Clinton sent Ms. Albright to Tokyo to brief Japanese officials on the China summit meeting, to reassure Japan of America's continuing affections and to poke Mr. Hashimoto to insure that he fulfills his promise to tackle Japan's economic mess.
"The alliance between our two nations is the embodiment of an unshakable friendship," Mrs. Albright said at a news conference this afternoon. "It is the foundation for stability in the Asia-Pacific. It is the cornerstone of our strategic policy in Asia."
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, standing beside Ms. Albright, looked slightly mollified at those words, even if Ms. Albright did omit the other cliche that used to be commonplace: that the United States-Japan relationship "is the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none."
Japanese scholars have often noted that historically the United States has tilted either toward Japan or toward China but has had difficulty being friendly simultaneously with both. Thus some have speculated that Washington's efforts to build ties with Beijing will now come at the expense of relations with Tokyo.
In addition, Japanese officials who used to complain about "Japan bashing" now fret about "Japan passing" -- a phrase referring to the lack of attention paid to Japan at all. The one thing worse than being insulted, it seems to people in Tokyo, is being ignored.
The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's most widely read newspaper, noted in a recent editorial the concerns that the summit meeting "may lead to a weakening of U.S. relations with Japan because Clinton will not be coming here." But it added archly that Washington-Beijing ties and Washington-Tokyo relations "can hardly be considered on the same level."
Ms. Albright went out of her way to make a point that some Japanese officials also make, at least in their more self-confident moments: that "the improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations is very much in Japan's interest as well."
"It is a 'win-win-win' outcome for the people of the United States, Japan and China," she said.
The United States had earlier invited Prime Minister Hashimoto to Washington for a state visit this month, as another consolation prize for not getting a Presidential visit. One purpose of the state visit will be to badger Mr. Hashimoto into taking bolder steps to boost Japan's economy, but Ms. Albright took advantage of her Tokyo stop to offer a nudge of her own.
She said that the United States was encouraged by Mr. Hashimoto's latest plans to deal with bad loans. There has been doubt in the financial markets about how thoroughly Japan will carry out the new policy, and so she added, "We now look forward to Japan's taking swift, concerted action to implement these measures."
Mr. Obuchi, asked about similar remarks by President Clinton urging Japan to take firm action, chose to interpret them as a vote of confidence rather than a kick in the seat.
"We appreciate that President Clinton evinced those invaluable remarks," Mr. Obuchi said.

HEADLINE: Japan Voters Send Message: No Change

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: KOCHI, Japan, July 2

 BODY:
All the world seems to be thumping on Japanese politicians these days, trying to get them to restructure the economy and reduce the risk of a global downturn. But here on the campaign trail, the message to the politicians is different.
When candidates for the July 12 parliamentary elections stump in towns like Kochi, a pretty coastal hub of 320,000 surrounded by coves of weathered fishing boats, the message that politicians get -- and the one they echo -- is Japan's need for more of the same. 
The issues here have less to do with economic policy than with pork: the ability of an official to pick the pocket of the central Government and build roads, bridges and dams. When the topic of economic liberalization comes up, it is often as an evil force to be constrained.
"We Japanese can't eat meat three times a day," Hiroyuki Morishita, the candidate for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in the Kochi area, told an audience in the Fishermen's Center in the little town of Nakatosa, in a swipe at the Government's willingness to liberalize meat imports. "I would like to respect the culture of fish! I want to protect fishermen!"
Another local politician already serving in Parliament, Yuji Yamamoto, drew vigorous applause when he denounced the deregulation of retailing and finance. Most of the world has regarded Japan's financial liberalization this year as long overdue, but Mr. Yamamoto said that a result has been capital flight from Japan to the United States.
"Stock prices have fallen, the yen has fallen, and the dollar has risen!" Mr. Yamamoto bellowed as the crowd nodded. "We are not living to serve the Americans."
So while Japan is suffering its worst recession in the postwar era, unemployment is at a record and foreign analysts are warning that Japan could set off a world-wide depression, the issue in the electoral districts is which candidate can best divert national funds to build more local dams.
"These dams, these little roads and bridges are very important for the rural areas," said Mr. Morishita, 56, as he loosened his tie and sat on the floor of the auditorium for a chat after the audience had drifted out. "They help everybody in rural areas make a living. It's the only way for these areas to get a cash income."
A genial man with a radiant smile, Mr. Morishita said that in half of the 53 towns in Kochi prefecture, the biggest industry is construction.
"People criticize pork barreling, but Kochi is remote and doesn't have much industry," Mr. Morishita noted. "So for voters in these areas, this is better than nothing."
American officials often complain that Japan's political system is dysfunctional, unable to cope with the economic crisis. But the paralysis in Tokyo may have less to do with the system than with the public mood it reflects, for the excellent prospects of the governing Liberal Democrats in the current campaign suggest that many Japanese do not want the fundamental restructuring favored by the United States.
"Japanese voters basically don't want drastic change," said Hitoshi Toyama, a political columnist for Kochi Shimbun, a local daily. That comment is echoed by almost every politician and voter one speaks to, particularly outside the biggest cities.
Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of the Orix Corporation in Tokyoand a prominent executive in Japan, says the essential reason for the country's crisis is this deep-seated reluctance in the provinces to embrace a global market economy. Mr. Miyauchi refers to the Liberal Democratic Party, or L.D.P., as the "Japan country party" because of its deep roots in the countryside.
"If you look at most of the L.D.P. representatives, they are elected from the countryside and they are not connected to the global economy," Mr. Miyauchi said. "The majority of people here are not willing to be led by economic forces. And so we have very deep problems."
As in many countries, the electoral system in Japan greatly amplifies the voices of people in rural areas. This election is for the upper house of Parliament, and a member can represent as few as 241,000 voters in rural Tottori Prefecture or as many as 1.2 million in Tokyo.
The upper house is less important than the lower house, but the election could still have important consequences. If the Liberal Democratic Party ends up with fewer seats than before -- it now holds 61 of the 126 seats in contention -- then that could force the resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
Most polls show the Liberal Democrats likely to gain seats, however. Indeed, some experts suggest that the Liberal Democrats could win 69 or more seats, enough to give them a majority of the upper house to go along with their existing majority in the lower house.
One of the gains for the Liberal Democrats is likely to be this district in Kochi, on the southern island of Shikoku. The seat is now held by an opposition figure who is not running this time, and Mr. Morishita is in the lead among the five candidates.
The opposition candidates together will almost certainly garner more votes than Mr. Morishita will, and in a two-party system the Liberal Democrats might well be evicted from power. But Japan is an oddity, something of a one-party state. The opposition is severely fragmented with little chance of taking power, at least in the next couple of years, and a result is a political machine like that of the American South in the decades when Democrats ran the game.
The lack of a credible opposition means that disaffected Japanese stay away from the polls altogether. Because elections are not perceived as a viable choice or a mechanism for change, the voting rates keep dropping -- to 51 percent in the 1992 upper house election, 44 percent in 1995, and an anticipated record low of less than 40 percent this time.
Fewer votes benefit the Liberal Democrats, because they are well-organized and can mobilize supporters more than the opposition parties.
It might seem remarkable that a ruling party could gain seats as it presides over the worst economic slump in half a century, as it is roundly condemned for corruption and cronyism. But the Liberal Democrats are campaigning on the basis that although they may have made the economic mess, they are also the best ones to clean it up.
"The critical thing is to come up with measures to revive the economy, and only the Liberal Democratic Party can do that," said Hiromitsu Ikeda, a town councilman in Nakatosa. "That's why it's very important for the Liberal Democrats to gain a majority in both houses of Parliament."
While there is widespread public annoyance at politicians, there is little of the "throw the bums out" sentiment that periodically sweeps the United States. Indeed, Mr. Morishita is campaigning in part on the basis of his long involvement in politics, including 10 years in Tokyo, as evidence that he can turn on the financing spigots and help his district.
"Mr. Morishita will be more efficient at getting subsidies," said Takao Yorimitsu, a prefectural assemblyman and Mr. Morishita's campaign manager.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Sojourn in China, Viewed From the Cookout

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ill., July 4

 BODY:
Sitting on a bench under a maple tree near Abraham Lincoln's old law office in this cornfield-hemmed Illinois capital, Janice Reese, who works on the cleaning staff at a hospital, confessed that she knew little about American diplomacy in China.
But as Ms. Reese watched some of the televised images from that faraway Communist-ruled land, whose leaders and people were greeting President Clinton, she said she saw something more profound than policy. 
 "You saw the smiles of the Chinese people," said Ms. Reese, 33. "They were cheering our President, mothers holding up babies. They don't hate us. It really gives you hope."
At the start of a scorching Independence Day weekend, Midwesterners were mostly thinking about parades and cookouts and fireworks. But the President's foray into China does appear to have made the radar screen, judging from more than two dozen interviews in this city of 105,000, with most people giving the trip favorable reviews.
"Clinton's smart enough to know you can't just ignore a place as big as China," said Ron Sherer, 49, a fire department dispatcher, as he sat in a booth in the Sunrise Cafe and ate a breakfast he called the "cholesterol special" -- two eggs, a slab of ham, fried potatoes, biscuits and gravy. "It's important to open new markets for American companies." He added that he was impressed with the President for "talking candidly" about the crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
To be sure, some people here denounced the President's decision to travel to China, criticizing him for a weak defense of the rights of political dissidents, or scoffing that Mr. Clinton was simply eager to shift the focus from the embarrassing reports spilling out of investigations in Washington.
"I think it stinks," said Clarence Gatton, a 60-year-old retired bus driver, who was trimming his backyard hedge for a family picnic. "Clinton had no business going over there in the first place. And then he treats these dictators like they're so great."
In the kitchen of her split-level house, Ann Marie Heffernan, 33, said Mr. Clinton had squandered a chance to defend political dissent. "He was not nearly forceful enough in condemning human rights abuses," said Ms. Heffernan, as she tried to quell the noisy rebellion of her year-old son, John, who sat in a highchair with chocolate smeared on his face. "I understand he wants to build a relationship. And it's obvious that the Chinese, like the Americans, are taken with his charm and charisma. But he should stand up for what is right."
Some people did not give a hoot about the ballyhooed trip.
"Doesn't impact me," said Tracey Bohannon, a 31-year-old secretary, "so I just skipped right past it."
And others had not heard about it.
"To be completely honest, I had no clue he'd been to China," said Jenny Lang, a 22-year-old lifeguard.
For those who were paying attention, the trip revealed the face of a changing China.
Liz Handley, a 30-year-old bank lobbyist, was impressed by images of Chinese talking on cell phones as they walked the streets. "It certainly didn't fit with the picture of Chinese people they taught us in the eighth grade," she said.
Others talked about seeing an interview with a technological entrepreneur in China who made his first $1 million before age 30 -- scarcely the embodiment of the revolutionary tenets of Chairman Mao.
But just about everybody -- people who cheered the China trip and those who criticized it -- agreed about one thing: the trip was exquisitely choreographed.
"One gigantic stage performance," said Lou Myers, 66, who works in real estate. "It really was overdone. Why not just go, have your talks and come home?"
An exception to the tight control, and the most memorable image to most people here, was the live broadcast of a news conference with Mr. Clinton and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin.
During that conference, Mr. Clinton said Americans disapproved of the way that Chinese leaders had crushed the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square at a cost of many civilian lives.
"For China, I thought that was being pretty candid," said Mr. Sherer, the fire department worker, even though President Jiang defended the crackdown. "It says to me that things are changing over there, starting to open up."
In many ways, the China trip has been cast through the prism of the global economy. It is important for American businesses, the logic goes, to gain access to markets in the world's most populous nation.
And yet, it is those economic inroads that make some Americans uneasy, even some of President Clinton's strong supporters, particularly the blue-collar workers suspicious of free-trade accords.
"I'm on the fence on this whole China thing," said Ted Applegate, a 39-year-old union member who works on the boiler at the coal-fired power plant here.
If more American companies did business in China, Mr. Applegate said, it would probably improve rights conditions there, because it would give China an incentive to avoid the political wrath of American lawmakers.
But Mr. Applegate, a bearded man in a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap, frets about making it easier for American companies to take advantage of cheap, nonunion labor in other countries.
"Who's going to stay here and pay a competitive wage when you can go to China and pay the workers next to nothing?" asked Mr. Applegate, who fiercely opposed the free-trade accords favored by Mr. Clinton but voted for him anyway. "We're seeing a lot of it already. The companies are making these record profits by exporting jobs."
In this city of Lincoln, images of the stovepipe hat seem as commonplace as fireflies in July (there are barber shops and chiropractic offices named for the rail-splitter turned President). There is also a lot of talk about honesty and politics, and how frequently the twain meet.
"The Chinese can say what they want, but how do we trust them?" said Frank Allison, a short-order cook at the Sunrise, a big man hovering over the grill with a toothpick in his mouth. "Talk's easy; talk's cheap. Action is what it's all about."
Down by the Old State Capitol building, now a museum, Ms. Reese, the hospital cleaning worker, said she planned to make a real celebration of Independence Day this year.
"You wouldn't think Clinton and that Chinese President would get along, but they seemed to," said Ms. Reese, as she rose from her bench, making her way down a cobblestone walkway to shop for groceries and maybe a little beer. "If the leaders don't fight, you know, then maybe we can stay out of wars."

HEADLINE: Investors Bet on Revival for Troubled Newark

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 4

 BODY:
Real estate investors hungry for new and cheaper territory have begun placing bets on downtown Newark, buying up a dozen buildings over the last 18 months in an early sign that the fortunes of New Jersey's largest city may be reversing after decades of decline.
The city, a national symbol of urban decay since the riots in 1967, has benefited from the real estate boom in Manhattan and its suburbs, where yearly office rents run as high as $60 a square foot. In Newark, by contrast, high-quality office space can be found for $12 a square foot. The price is so attractive that some New York companies have opened offices in Newark -- about 15 minutes from Manhattan by train -- rather than in Jersey City, their usual choice on this side of the Hudson. 
 At the same time, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a handsome $180 million brick building in the heart of the business district, has been more successful than even its supporters had hoped. About half a million people have attended events there since it opened last fall.
"Newark had a stigma to it for a long time," said Christian Benedetto, who with his partner, Glen Fishman, bought the 21-story tower at 24 Commerce Street, New Jersey's tallest building during Newark's heyday in the 1920's. "Over the years, you've heard about six different revitalizations. Now you've got a lot of people putting their money where their mouth is."
Steven C. Witkoff, a New York investor who recently bought the Woolworth Building in Manhattan, has also jumped into downtown Newark. He paid $240 million for the four towers at the Gateway Center last month. Two weeks ago, the Tremont Capital Group, a Houston company, bought the old First Union Bank building at 550 Broad Street. Blackacre Capital Group, which owns about $1 billion in real estate in Manhattan and elsewhere, bought 60 Park Place in March.
No one is saying that Newark's revival will be immediate or inevitable. Much of this activity is taking place in a relatively small section of the city and will do little to offset the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs over the last four decades, or to revive the hardscrabble neighborhoods where schools are substandard and unemployment is high.
And despite the enthusiasm of Newark's new real estate investors, they must still push hard to fill their newly acquired buildings.
"There are a lot of positive signs on the surface," said Donald Eisen, a broker for Cushman & Wakefield. "But I don't see any real major users coming into the city, as opposed to going to the waterfront in Jersey City. We really need a new, major corporate commitment."
Still, many investors are betting that this commitment is coming to Newark, which has an international airport and whose harbor on Newark Bay and network of highways and rail lines made it a manufacturing center before World War II. These amenities may prove crucial to the city's revival.
 
Promising Signs Include Park and Stadium Plans
There are many other hopeful signs. The city, state and Federal governments are pouring millions of dollars into plans for a two-mile esplanade along the Passaic River, a minor-league baseball stadium and a $49 million law school for Rutgers University. New Jersey Transit has planned a milelong trolley line from Symphony Hall on Chestnut Street to Pennsylvania Station, the baseball stadium, the arts center and the Broad Street Station, with connections to Manhattan and the suburbs.
Just as important, the Prudential Insurance Company, one of the city's few remaining civic pillars, has moved 3,800 employees to Newark from suburban sites, increasing its downtown work force to about 7,000.
On Tuesday, a group of private investors led by Raymond G. Chambers bought a majority interest in the Nets, the professional basketball team, with the intention of building a new arena in Newark, near Pennsylvania Station, for the Nets and the Devils hockey team.
But Mr. Chambers and his fellow investors face a difficult task in persuading Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and John McMullen, the owner of the Devils, to support the move. And most economists are skeptical of the economic value of stadiums and arenas for anyone other than team owners and players, although the teams could bring an enormous amount of recognition and prestige to the city.
For more than a year, a private foundation led by Mr. Chambers, a financier turned philanthropist who has become the unofficial godfather of Newark, has been acquiring land along Broad and Halsey Streets, including the long-vacant S. Klein building. The goal is to accelerate a downtown revival and link the business district around Pennsylvania Station, the arts center to the north and the University Heights neighborhood to the west.
Mr. Chambers, who grew up in Newark but now lives in Morristown, and the New Newark Foundation hope to lease or sell the properties to retailers and developers who conform to a design by Tony Goldman, who helped redevelop South Miami Beach in the 1980's. Once a run-down Art Deco district, South Miami Beach is now a bustling enclave of nightclubs, hotels and restaurants.
Mr. Goldman said his plan envisions an urban community of four- and five-story buildings with larger retailers, restaurants and nightclubs along Broad Street and smaller storefronts and local entrepreneurs on Halsey Street. Professional offices and apartments for students, office workers, artists and others would occupy the upper floors. Although the foundation's plans took Mayor Sharpe James by surprise when they surfaced last month in The Star-Ledger, Mr. Goldman hopes to win the approval of local officials. Profits from the venture will be invested in other Newark neighborhoods, Mr. Goldman said.
"This is not just a real estate venture," Mr. Goldman said. "This is a social opportunity to get people who used to live in Newark to come back to the city and interact in this urban village."
 
An Effort to Compete With Jersey City Rents
In the competition for office development, Jersey City has had the advantage of being a few minutes closer to Manhattan and offering views of the New York City skyline that Newark, farther west, cannot. Many of the investment banks that moved some operations out of Manhattan landed in Jersey City.
But a test of the relative merits of Newark and Jersey City is in the works. In the words of one real estate broker, Merrill Lynch has "proposals out all over the place" for a million square feet of office space.
Alfred L. Faiella, Newark's Deputy Mayor for economic development, said he had been negotiating with state officials and representatives of a company interested in building a million-square-foot tower in New Jersey. Mr. Faiella said he did not know whether the company was Merrill Lynch.
"It's hard to take a New York company away from the Jersey City waterfront," Mr. Faiella said, "but we've put together a major package of incentives, everything from tax rebates to low-interest loans."
He cautioned that Newark still faced an uphill climb. He said he wanted to revive downtown and build housing in the neighborhoods, while continuing to use tax breaks and other incentives to encourage business development.
"The Mayor says we're on a roll," Mr. Faiella said. "We've got to keep pushing that tire along, otherwise it'll stop rolling."
Some companies have shown a willingness to consider Newark. The LZA Group, a large engineering and architectural firm based in Manhattan, recently leased a floor for 30 employees at 24 Commerce Street. Jay Prasad, executive vice president of LZA, said he found that rents in Newark were about one-third of those in Manhattan.
"We looked around and we found that Newark is very cost-effective compared with New York and Jersey City," Mr. Prasad said. "It's only 15 minutes away from Manhattan by New Jersey Transit. And by opening an office in Newark, we've been able to attract personnel who don't want to commute into New York."
Worldcom, the giant communications company, recently leased 65,000 square feet in the old Macy's building on Market Street, once the home of Bamberger's department store, for a telephone switching station. It is not a plush corporate headquarters, but Samuel J. Jemal, whose family bought the building 18 months ago, said there was enough demand for wide-open floors and high ceilings to turn the upper floors of the building into office space for telecommunications companies.
"Newark is the best value in the tristate area," said Arthur Stern, chairman of Cogswell Realty Group, which bought two of Newark's largest buildings. "Occupancy costs are one-third cheaper than in Jersey City, and it's got the best transportation in the region."
Mr. Stern's company is spending $45 million to renovate the National Newark Building at 744 Broad Street, once the city's most prestigious office tower. Mr. Stern bought the Art Deco tower for about $11 a square foot, a far cry from the $500 a square foot that Donald J. Trump paid for the General Motors Building in Manhattan. Cogswell plans to convert another nearby building, the Raymond Commerce Building at 1180 Raymond Boulevard, into a dormitory for students at the five colleges and universities in Newark.
 
Hopes Are Raised By Sudden Turnaround
The turnaround here has come suddenly. In late 1996, for example, Townsend Capital, an investment company based in Maryland, bought the Gateway II office building near Pennsylvania Station for $35 million. "It was a tough sale," said Daniel Cramer, a vice president with Townsend. "Our lender turned it down twice because it was Newark."
But in May, Townsend sold Gateway II to Mr. Witkoff for $78 million, more than twice what it paid 18 months earlier. More recently, Townsend paid $12 million for the former Blue Cross and Blue Shield headquarters at 33 Washington Street and is spending millions to renovate it.
"The Performing Arts Center has been a huge plus," Mr. Cramer said. "But Prudential's decision to consolidate its operations has been an incredible shot in the arm. We think that'll spawn other companies to consider the same move. I don't believe this will be a revolutionary change. It's going to take time to emerge."
Mr. Witkoff, who was an aggressive real estate buyer in Manhattan in the mid-1990's, when many investors feared that the market would never recover from the recession, went on to buy the other three buildings in the Gateway Complex.
"I love Newark," Mr. Witkoff said. "It reminds me of lower Manhattan three years ago. It's centrally located, and it's going to take off."
All these developments have thrilled Miles P. Berger, who bought the Holiday Inn at 430 Broad Street in 1976 for $500,000, a tiny sum for a 200-room motel with a ballroom, restaurant and pool on three acres. Renamed the Lincoln Motel, the property began a downward spiral as Mr. Berger housed the homeless under contracts with New York and New Jersey. Mr. Berger also bought the Robert Treat Hotel, once the city's best, and later, the old Hahne's Department Store on Broad Street.
Mr. Berger said that the arts center had improved business at the Robert Treat and that he was leasing the Hahne's building to the New Newark Foundation. On Tuesday, he said, he talked to the Holiday Inn about resuming the franchise at the Lincoln Hotel.
"We've come full circle," Mr. Berger said. "All these signals told us the time is ripe to turn that motel back into a Holiday Inn franchise. For 17 years there was nothing going on here. People ran from Newark."

HEADLINE: True to Form, Clinton Shifts Energies Back To U.S. Focus

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
After a long trip to China that his aides believe strengthened the President against the Republican Congress and Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent prosecutor, President Clinton returned home this weekend and immediately took to the air waves to report on his high hopes for improving . . . fruit juice.
In his weekly radio address this morning, President Clinton tersely summarized his trip before moving on to the focus of his message: new regulations to increase the safety of fruit and vegetable juices. 
 In a favorite formula for this White House, Mr. Clinton dropped his foreign trip cold upon touching American soil and turned to domestic policy. For the coming week, aides have planned events on health care, drugs and juvenile crime to remind voters of the President's devotion to fixing problems that may seem more pressing than Chinese rights or rockets.
With some of his closest advisers deeply pessimistic about the chances of getting major legislation passed during the rest of the year, Mr. Clinton plans to issue a series of executive orders to demonstrate that he can still be effective.
"Stroke of the pen," Paul Begala, an aide to Mr. Clinton, said in summarizing the approach. "Law of the land. Kind of cool."
At the same time, with an eye to the brewing budget fight and the Congressional elections this fall, the President is expected to step up pressure on the Republican Congress, as he did in the radio address.
"Congress must also do its part to insure the safety of America's food supply," Mr. Clinton said.
Some of his closest advisers have concluded that there will be no budget deal this year like the bipartisan balanced-budget agreement struck with much fanfare a year ago. Having failed at one of Mr. Clinton's top domestic priorities, sweeping tobacco legislation. his team hopes to exact a political toll from the Republicans for Beltway gridlock.
On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton intends to hold a ceremony to issue an executive order to promote greater access to health care for Federal employees, aides said. He will couple that move with a plea to Congress to pass his "Patients' Bill of Rights," legislation for standards in managed care.
As a result of all this domestic politicking, the China trip is likely to slip off Washington's radar screen very fast. In the same manner, when Mr. Clinton returned in early April from a lengthy trip to Africa, he immediately held a Rose Garden ceremony to boast about the American economy and to describe his legislative agenda on education, highways and tobacco.
Ann F. Lewis, the White House communications director, put it this way: "We tend not to spend a lot of time talking about what we've just done. Or, to put it differently, we could talk about it, but you wouldn't write about it, so that wouldn't make much sense. The events we do are always forward-looking."
Yet Mr. Clinton's advisers are banking on political momentum from his trip to China. They hope that the success of the trip will blunt Congressional hearings into decisions by the Clinton Administration to permit American companies to launch satellites on Chinese rockets.
Ms. Lewis sorted through a stack of editorials from Fort Worth, Pittsburgh, and Abilene, Tex., arguing that Mr. Clinton had received strong reviews nationwide, including in such editorially chilly pages as those of The Wall Street Journal.
As when he was on his Africa trip, Mr. Clinton is returning home having just received an unexpected lift from the courts. While the President was in Senegal in April, a Federal judge dismissed Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct case against him; this time, while the President was in China, a Federal judge here rebuked Mr. Starr and dismissed the tax evasion indictment he had won against Webster L. Hubbell, Mr. Clinton's old friend and former Justice Department appointee.
One senior adviser said the trip, which resulted in a flood of favorable news articles, showed Mr. Clinton attending to the substance of his job. As a result, the adviser said, Mr. Starr's decision this week to call a high-profile witness, Linda R. Tripp, heightened the contrast between the investigation at home and Mr. Clinton's work abroad, making the former seem "small and petty."
But any such impression could quickly fade, because this White House has a sorrowful history of seeing its well-laid plans vaporized by unpleasant surprises. After all, it was barely two days after Mr. Clinton returned from Africa that the first news report appeared detailing his Administration's decisions to permit satellite launchings in China.

New World's Treasures Uncovered at Site in Cuba
Archeologists in the Americas have tended to focus on societies with large physical legacies, like the Aztecs. But a Canadian team has turned toward the native people of Cuba and some other Caribbean islands, known as the Taino. Digging at an underwater site in Cuba, they have uncovered the remnants of houses 500 to 700 years old. 1
 
Mixed Reviews for Clinton
Americans appeared at least to take notice of President Clinton's foray into China. In more than two dozen interviews, most gave the trip favorable reviews. Some criticized the President for a weak defense of human rights, or scoffed that he was trying to shift attention from investigations in Washington. Others said they simply didn't give a hoot. 1

HEADLINE: China and Taiwan Are Warming to Each Other

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In Shanghai President Clinton warned that China was about to assume the distinction of replacing the United States as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (news article, June 25). 
 Data from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center suggest that the President's comments are premature. China's total carbon dioxide emissions are unlikely to overtake the United States for another 10 to 20 years, and in per-capita terms China's carbon dioxide emissions are still one-sixth of those of the United States.
It is true that the developing world has begun to claim an increasing share of the world's greenhouse emissions. Ultimately, however, policies informed by an understanding of the relationships between technology, economic growth and emissions will prove more helpful than alarmist rhetoric in addressing these trends.

HEADLINE: Bill to Aid Small Airlines in New York Divides Legislators

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
On the surface, the two problems seem about as related as toothaches and hangnails: the budget-busting cost of flying on business out of New York's upstate cities, and the nerve-jangling roar of jets using La Guardia and Kennedy Airports in Queens.
But legislation moving briskly through Congress has bound the two together, by proposing a treatment for the first that many New York City officials believe will thoroughly aggravate the second. The result has been a classic bit of regional squabbling within New York's Congressional delegation over whether the city's quality-of-life concerns are drowning out the economic problems of smaller communities upstate. 
 At stake is legislation intended to increase airline competition in mid-size cities like Albany, Rochester, Syracuse and Buffalo, where an unrestricted round-trip ticket to Chicago can cost more than the excursion round-trip fare to Hong Kong.
The bill would help start-up and regional airlines by giving them greater access to major airports, including La Guardia and Kennedy. Large airlines now control virtually all of the landing and takeoff slots at those airports.
But increasing competition at La Guardia and Kennedy requires increasing air traffic. To New Yorkers who live along flight corridors on Long Island and in Queens and the Bronx, that can only mean more ear-thumping, window-rattling, baby-waking noise. "It's unlivable now," said Stephen Hendel, whose home in Larchmont, Westchester County, falls under a flight path to La Guardia on busy days.
The issue has caused a regional rift in the state's Congressional delegation, a relatively cohesive group, uniting upstate Republicans and Democrats against their downstate brethren.
"We get more complaints about air noise than almost any other local issue," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat who represents parts of Westchester, the Bronx and Queens. "This legislation will only make the situation worse."
But for House members from Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany, which have some of the highest air fares in the country, the issue is a leading business problem.
"Perhaps this bill will increase traffic," said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat from Rochester. "But if that is the result, they'll just have to accept it. They have the major airports and get the benefits related to that."
Officials in Rochester, Buffalo and other upstate cities say air fares are so exorbitant that many companies have begun requiring employees to drive rather than fly to places like Boston or Chicago. Some have also raised the specter of moving entire divisions to cities that offer cheaper air transportation.
"When companies evaluate whether to expand in Rochester or elsewhere, the cost of transportation has become a factor," said Craig F. Curran, president of a travel agency in Rochester.
The dispute has created a dilemma for Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is seeking his party's endorsement for Senate. Mr. Schumer has made reducing air fares one of his top campaign issues upstate.
But jet noise is also a major issue in his home district, and Mr. Schumer recently signed a letter along with Ms. Lowey and five other members of Congress from the New York metropolitan area urging colleagues to reject the airline bill, known as the Airline Service Improvement Act.
James Kessler, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said the Congressman might propose an amendment that would allow regional carriers to increase their flights into La Guardia and Kennedy by giving them slots now controlled by the big airlines, rather than creating new slots. Such a plan would avoid increasing overall air traffic at the two airports, but would also face fierce opposition from major carriers.
Amid growing anger with high air fares across the country and Government accusations of predatory pricing by the major carriers, the airline competition legislation has gained widespread support among legislators in both parties. The Airline Service Improvement Act was approved overwhelmingly by the House Transportation Committee in June and is expected to reach the floor later this summer. Similar legislation is percolating in the Senate Commerce Committee, and its sponsors expect a floor vote by August.
At issue is a 30-year-old system that sets strict limits on the number of landing and takeoff slots available at four airports: La Guardia, Kennedy, O'Hare International in Chicago and Ronald Reagan National in Washington. Starting in 1985, the Federal Department of Transportation allowed the major airlines to treat their slots like property that could be sold, traded, leased or even used as collateral for loans. But rather than sell slots to start-up airlines, the big airlines have tended to hoard them or lease them at high rents, Federal officials say.
That has made it extremely difficult for regional airlines to establish routes to New York City, Washington and Chicago. The smaller airlines pay a premium to lease the few slots available in those cities, which translates into very high fares.
Refundable round-trip fares from Rochester to Chicago, the type of tickets business people traveling on short notice typically must buy, range from $900 to $1,055. A restricted round-trip fare from Rochester to Hong Kong can cost $880. Department of Transportation studies consistently rank Rochester among the nation's five most expensive cities for air travel.
Under the Airline Service Improvement Act, the Department of Transportation could grant additional landing slots at the four restricted airports to airlines that fly to underserved areas. The rule could add as many as two flights an hour at La Guardia and Kennedy.
Debate on the bill comes at a time when the Department of Transportation is preparing rules intended to stop major airlines from driving out new carriers with predatory practices, like flooding competitive routes with cheap seats. The big airlines are lobbying to block or delay those rules.
Over the last year, the department has also added 30 new slots at La Guardia, mainly for regional airlines, under a 1994 provision allowing such action under "exceptional circumstances," a department spokesman has said. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, have filed a lawsuit seeking to rescind those slots.
For Willard W. Hunter, president of Amarel, a Rochester company that makes optical equipment, increased airline competition could not come soon enough. Mr. Hunter said he requires employees to drive 10 hours to Chicago, where they do much of their business. "To send two or three people there would cost $1,800 or $2,700, which is absolutely ridiculous," he said. But Dr. A. Allan Greene, a Howard Beach, Queens, podiatrist and leader of a community group fighting airport noise, said he and his neighbors could not tolerate even one more flight a day into Kennedy.
"The bipartisan mind-set in Washington is, 'More, more, more is better in the sky,' " he said. "They have no consideration for the people down below. You can't hear anything. You can't have a conversation. I feel like an insect being crop-dusted."

HEADLINE: Reuniting New Yorkers With Forgotten Billions

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Kofi Annan, please call H. Carl McCall. His office has some money for you.
And not just for Mr. Annan, the United Nations Secretary General: Mr. McCall, the New York State Comptroller, has money for the Yankees' outfielder Darryl Strawberry, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, Gov. George E. Pataki and millions of other people whose forgotten bank accounts, uncashed travelers' checks, utility refunds and lost stocks have been turned over to the state. 
 The money is waiting to be claimed in the state abandoned property fund, which was established in 1943 and has reached a record $4.16 billion, a sum larger than the budgets of many nations.
The 15 million accounts range from the $700,000 that a New Yorker has left unclaimed, to small bank accounts forgotten by college students who have moved out of the area with no forwarding address, to $8 to $24 refunds for about 15,000 tickets for a concert scheduled for the Nassau Coliseum on Aug. 22, 1977, that was canceled after the featured performer -- Elvis Presley -- died.
"It is my job to collect unclaimed funds and then give them back to the people who deserve them," Mr. McCall, the State Comptroller, said in an interview. "If you look at the record over the years, you see that we take in much more money than we give out. We are trying to change that."
Under New York law, companies have to turn over money they are holding for consumers, like dormant bank accounts and uncashed refund checks, to the state after two to five years, depending on the type of account. Last year alone, the office received about $304 million in unclaimed funds, but returned only $60 million.
Publishing a list of the names of account holders annually, as required by state law, was not enough to prompt people to fill out claim forms to regain their money, so Mr. McCall placed the unclaimed funds database on a Web site (http:// www.osc.state.ny.us), which has logged 2.7 million searches since its introduction last July. And since this spring, the Comptroller's office has operated booths at high pedestrian traffic areas like train stations and racetracks to try to reunite people with their assets.
This stepped-up campaign has brought Mr. McCall attention, praise and the political boost that comes with mailing out checks, signed by the Comptroller, to voters in an election year. Mr. McCall, a Democrat, faces Bruce A. Blakeman, the Presiding Officer of the Nassau County Legislature, in the November election.
"It is a good thing they are doing by making these appearances, because a lot of people can't make it to an office to pick up forms," said Linda Ramous, a Chase Bank employee who stopped by the booth at Pennsylvania Station recently and found that the state had stock dividends in her dead aunt's name.
Because of the Web site, the number of claims has tripled to 60,000 in fiscal year 1997 from about 20,000 in fiscal year 1996, said Theresa Bourgeois, a spokeswoman for the Comptroller's office. But the more people who file, the slower the processing gets. Mr. McCall increased the number of employees handling unclaimed funds to 128 from 116 in January, but claims can take as much as five months to process.
All 50 states have some method of collecting and returning unclaimed funds, but none of them have collected anywhere near as much money as New York, rich in financial institutions that have to turn over forgotten accounts to the state. The $4.16 billion -- while small potatoes compared with the $100 billion in state pension funds that Mr. McCall also controls -- exceeds or rivals the annual budgets of 23 states. California follows New York with an unclaimed property fund of about $2.3 billion.
According to the National Association of State Treasurers, there are about 1.2 million unclaimed accounts in Connecticut totaling $260 million and about 2 million unclaimed accounts in New Jersey worth $659 million.
The State Treasurer's office in Connecticut returned a record $5 million in unclaimed property last year, said Patrick O'Neil, a spokesman who added that his state was the first to list names of account holders on the Internet in 1995. New Jersey returned about $16 million last year, said Stephen Sylvester, the unclaimed funds administrator with the Division of Taxation.
Most states use the interest made from unclaimed funds to cover the costs of their unclaimed property operations or for education or economic development programs. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut allow owners to collect limited amounts of interest on some funds.
Claimants must provide state officials with proof of their identity and a connection to the address listed on the account. People can also make claims for dead relatives.
The Governor discovered a modest windfall in the last few weeks when he was contacted by an official in the Comptroller's office.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said she thought his unclaimed funds were related to a bank account at a former home in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. "He has already filled out the forms for the claim," she said. "He does not have much money in there, I can assure you of that."

Signs of Discontent In the Aloha State

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
The Democratic Party has always carefully cultivated Hawaii's disparate racial and ethnic groups and, as a result, few states are more Democratic than the Aloha State. But that Democratic dominance faces a major test this year because the Hawaiian economy, unlike those of almost all other states, is in a deep, seven-year slump, its tourism sector hammered by Asia's financial crisis and unable to offset steady shrinkage in the agriculture and military sectors.
Hawaii could be a state where Democrats lose both a Governor and a member of the House of Representatives this fall. 
 The latest polls show the probable Republican challengers posing big trouble for state's top elected Democrat, Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, and one of its two Congressional Representatives, Neil Abercrombie. Equally serious, the polls indicate that voters, by 2 to 1, believe that Republicans, including those in the heavily Democratic State Legislature, could do a better job of restoring the economy than Democrats.
In the Governor's race, the polls have the expected Republican nominee, Mayor Linda Lingle of Maui, leading Mr. Cayetano by about 5 to 3. Her pitch is that even in the hardest of economic times, Ms. Lingle has managed to keep Maui moving forward, increasing jobs and tourism.
In the Congressional race, the polls show that the expected Republican challenger, State Representative Quentin Kawananakoa of Honolulu, has pulled even with Mr. Abercrombie. Mr. Kawananakoa promises to jump-start the state's economy with tax cuts, if elected.
Governor Cayetano and Mr. Abercrombie, who are expected to be renominated, contend that polls taken five months before the general election do not mean much. Still, they acknowledge that Hawaii's economic slump has left them with a major political problem. As Mr. Cayetano said at a recent rally, "This election is going to be one of the great challenges that we Democrats have faced."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE;
Looking at the Lawn, and Below the Surface

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
SOMETHING awful is happening to the planet Earth. It has been invaded by the Earth-snatchers. It is being turned into a pod planet, one lawn at a time. Thirty-two million acres have been snatched thus far on the North American continent alone. More land is now occupied by lawns than is given over to the cultivation of wheat, corn or tobacco. It costs $750 million annually to seed this turf. Another $25 billion is invested each year in mowers, clippers, gardening gloves, hoses and other do-it-yourself tools.
Life on the pod planet can be delightful, especially in the month of July. You can lie on your back on the lawn and stare at the sky. Make a grass kazoo. Cut open a maple seed and stick it on your nose. Season your jeans with grass stains. Become a Cheever character and run out sobbing into the night. 
 "The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life," a corker of a show at the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal (through Sept. 27), begins with a ride on a lawn sprinkler. Or at least the video depiction of one. Back and forth the camera swings, scanning the archetypal patch of grass, oscillating between peripheral glimpses of equally iconic neighbors on either side: the no-nonsense lady trimming her hedge to clipped perfection, the cool kids hanging out by the garage. In the background, water hisses.
The video is projected onto the floor, and you hesitate to step on it. Your shadow might block the projection. Thus the show stylishly connects two kinds of transgression: one associated with land, the other with museums. Keep Off. Don't Touch. That kind of elegant connection occurs throughout this show.
It's probably best seen as one large piece of multimedia design, in which ideas ricochet among artworks, aerial satellite photographs, squares of sod, television news footage, solar-powered robot lawn mowers, even a pink flamingo or two.
The lawn is a natural subject for a summer show, if also a highly perverse one. Even those who don't own a lawn might wish to preserve that small plot of green as a symbolic escape from civilization. This show plunges us into history, economics, sociology, psychology and other cold-weather pursuits. The lawn is our last little shred of Eden. Trees of Knowledge are no more wanted here than weeds. Can't we please keep thinking off the grass?
"The American Lawn" gives little quarter to innocence. There are no pictures of kids leaping through sprinklers. No shots of lovers discovering splendor in the grass. But the show does confer innocence upon the visitor, for we are left feeling that there is everything yet to learn about the everyday world we live in.
IN 1976, Elizabeth Drew wrote a beautiful article for The New Yorker about the mood of the country on the Fourth of July in the bicentennial year. She describes how the news media, the politicians and the salesmen have done everything within their power to appropriate the event, and in the process nearly killed it off. But they didn't kill it off. People found ways to act spontaneously. They ate burgers, drank beer, paraded in small-town marching bands, cheered displays of fireworks as if the spectacle expressed a set of values to which they still subscribed.
Ignoring authority may be one way to resist it, but this show rests on the democratic principle that it's better to be informed.
The curators start with the premise that the lawn represents the fusion of two traditions: the "cultivated" model of great European estates and private parks, and the "vernacular" example of the small colonial garden. This distinction, first analyzed by the historian John Kouwenhoven, held firm until the late 19th century. With the emergence of suburban communities, this distinction began to collapse into the continental green tapestry of today.
"Cultivated" takes on a literal meaning here. In the forthcoming catalogue, Georges Teyssot writes that "certain horticulturalists like Sara Stein have come to consider the lawn a surface that while vegetal is artificial in that it attains its emerald splendor only when subjected to perpetual torture. 'Continual amputation is a critical aspect of lawn care,' Stein has observed. 'Cutting grass regularly -- preventing it from reaching up and flowering -- forces it to sprout still more blades, more rhizomes, more roots, to become an ever more impenetrable mat, until it becomes the perfect lawn, the perfect sealant through which nothing else can grow.' "
Lawn care, in other words, is much like road care and serves a similar purpose. "Like the interstate highway system," the author Michael Pollan has observed, "the lawn has served to unify the American landscape." But differences, conflicts and nature itself are not as easily mowed down as grass.
The architectural historian Reyner Banham used to horrify professional audiences by declaring that architecture is that which changes land use. But the truth of that statement becomes ever more apparent with the daily expansion of urban sprawl. "The American Lawn" is about land use. There are ideas behind the cultivation of wheat, corn and tobacco, and tension lurks beneath the two-inch layer of green stuff on which Americans have staged their placid dreams for more than a century.
"The American Lawn" is the last in an ambitious cycle of shows on "The American Century" organized by Phyllis Lambert, the Canadian Center's dynamic director. The whole series has been a triumph, but the inaugural show, "Scenes From the Life To Come," and the present exhibition are examples of curatorial brilliance.
It was organized by a stellar team: Mr. Teyssot, Allesandra Ponte, Mark Wigley, Beatriz Colomina, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio. Mark Wasiuta and Gwynne Keathly assisted the team. Diller & Scofidio Architects, of New York, designed the installation.
Since cultural values tend to coax up their opposites, a space dedicated to harmony and independence can easily become a battlefield. Is an overgrown lawn a protected form of speech? How about Christmas ornaments on the lawn? Or a cross-burning? Does the Postal Service have right of way when delivering the mail?
Excerpts from court cases in which lawns figured as contested terrain are featured in one gallery, along with a row of stereopticons. Each of these contains a 3-D image of the border between two neighboring lawns. In one shot, it is clear that one neighbor is a fastidious raker while the other has allowed a half-dozen picturesque leaves to gather, the slob. In another, a well-watered plot abuts a parched one. The groomed and the neglected strike a recurring theme, played out across the continent in contrapuntal variations. Sometimes, the grass is less green. Often, it is brown.
In a section on the competitive lawn, the contest at first looks more sporting. The focus here is on the intricate patterns mowed into the grass in sports stadiums. But there is greater competition here than meets the eye. What's at stake is not just victory in a game but lucrative broadcasting contracts. To make sports events more telegenic, stadium managements have commissioned increasingly elaborate designs for animating the playing surface, including plaids, swirls and sunburst motifs. These video lawns are vying for ratings.
Another kind of contest is documented by photographs of golf courses in desert climates like Arizona. The contest here is between nature and our visual image of it. These artificially created terrains have already altered local weather patterns, and, if chaos theory is correct, their impact could well be global. But aren't they beautiful, these emerald islands adrift in what looks like a giant sand trap of planetary proportions? Is this a preview of coming attractions?
The Power Lawn is represented in two formats, corporate and governmental. In the 1960's, as corporate headquarters relocated to the suburbs, their International Style headquarters were typically surrounded by grandiose grass plinths. These served as moats, visual statements of intimidation. This retro-feudal form is handsomely represented by professional black-and-white architectural photographs of the period. These lawns are so stark, so flat, so blatantly designed to hold the world at bay that it would be shocking to pollute them with anything as capricious as color.
The North Lawn of the White House, by contrast, is a backdrop for chaos: the unruly spectacle of political protest. Not that it was designed for that, but here democracy has happily appropriated one of its major symbols. Rallies are presented in television news footage, screened on small monitors suspended from sleek metal arms down the center of the gallery. Another monitor displays scenes of Presidential arrivals and departures by helicopter on the South Lawn.
By now our eyes are so primed to notice sheared surfaces that we may detect a resemblance between a neglected lawn and the autumn-haze mink coat Pat Nixon wore when she and her husband took off for China. On the other hand, in a contrast that recalls one of those stereopticon views, Mrs. Nixon's hairstyle is luscious and as beautifully tended as a French garden, while the President's hair is patchy.
HAND-PAINTED glass slides line the perimeter of a gallery on "Idyll and Anxiety." Drawn from a collection assembled in the 1920's and 30's by the Garden Club of America, they depict scenes as ravishing as pastorals by Boucher and Fragonard. Ah, the poplars, the willows, the urns bulging with moss atop balustrades wrapped around terraces on which visions of loveliness, graceful ladies and their escorts, will momentarily appear!
It is unnerving to think that many of them were painted during the Dust Bowl years.
The flip side of this reverie is projected on a screen that slices into the gallery's center: clips from movies in which the dark subconscious of pastoral bliss punches through the thin green crust.
"Blue Velvet," naturally, but also a great comic sequence from the 1956 version of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" in which Kevin McCarthy tries to persuade a reluctant neighbor that she should consult a psychiatrist about her wild suspicion that something awful has happened to Uncle Ira (shown obsessively mowing the lawn next door).
Pod person or mental patient, what's it going to be?
Lawns have their pathology, too: fungi, viruses, nematodes, insects, air pollution, dog urine. Color photographs of these and other afflictions are mounted on one wall, the particular strain identified below in a Latinate script of old botany prints.
These are clearly offered for our viewing pleasure with a degree of gleeful relish: they convey a city dweller's delight over trouble in suburban paradise. But these pastoral sores are also easy on the eyes. Even if the artist Mel Chin (not represented in the show) had not called attention to the esthetic dimension of ecological imbalance, the resemblance of these images to abstract painting would be impossible to miss.
This is a visual and philosophical show, not a scientific or ecological one. While it observes the environmental impact of the suburban way of life, it does not preach the virtues of recycling or condemn our failure to adopt methods for sustainable urban growth. The show documents and analyzes. It fertilizes the cultural terrain from which even environmental issues draw meaning.
Across from the disease wall there's a vitrine displaying square samples of grass, natural and artificial. Both types have been engineered to enhance desirable qualities, like springiness, color or resistance to weather. The point of the display is to suggest not that there is no difference between nature and artifice but that modern life has rendered the contrast less extreme. Once, cultural meaning revolved around the polarity dividing the two. Now, it has moved deeper into the space between.
Diller and Scofidio's work occupies a middle space, too: between theory and conventional practice. Though they have published several books, and a housing project of theirs is nearing completion in Gifu, Japan, the team is best known for temporary installations, like those created for the Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center and the Creative Times public-art program on 42d Street. The two are not paper architects. They enjoy making things too much, and their pleasure shows.
"The American Lawn" is not as chillingly analytic as it may sound. It's true that the curators come out of the academy, and their thinking owes much to post-structuralist philosophy. But the show pulsates with such intelligence, wit and even glamour that it can't be taken as a lecture room performance.
The Garden Club slides, for example, are not set up to be mocked. They are gorgeous fantasies, to be cherished as such. The notion that suburban normalcy represses difference might seem obvious if the exchange with Uncle Ira were less enjoyably hilarious. One can admire the stark beauty of Ezra Stoller's architectural photos while recoiling from the meaning of the lawns he depicts.
Diller and Scofidio know how to entertain as well as edify. Though they rely extensively on dialectic, the technique seldom becomes oppressively schematic. And the team always creates seductive hardware.
Little magnifying glasses to highlight passages of text in a row of old gardening books. The thinnest metal vermicelli cable to hold the stereopticons. A glass table, supported atop the soles of athletic footgear, to demonstrate the changing shape of grip. A red zipper LED sign flickers mysteriously behind the reflection of grass in a two-way mirror.
There's a bright shimmer to this exhibition, an aura of energy and delight that you may associate more with walks in the country than with trips to museums. If I had to account for this shimmering effect, I would say that Diller and Scofidio's main concern is the differentiation of meaning and that for them, this process is inseparable from image, space and form.
Diller and Scofidio's work is now much imitated. You can't lead unless you're willing to tolerate followers, and a critic should not cringe each time he encounters a superficial emulation of this pair's visual and intellectual effects. Still, leaders and followers are not of the same cultural order of being, and seeing the real thing is a pleasure. I came away from "The American Lawn" convinced that intelligence is as generous, merciless and playful as nature, and no less increasingly rare.

HEADLINE: Perspective;
Team Profits and Labor Peace

BYLINE: By ANDREW ZIMBALIST; Andrew Zimbalist is professor of economics at Smith College. He has written extensively about sports.

 BODY:
The Florida Marlins lost more than $30 million last year. Right, and Dennis Rodman has no tattoos.
The National Basketball Association contends that more than half of its teams are losing money. The N.B.A. players association says that only five teams lost money last year, and four of those are getting new arenas. 
 The N.B.A. owners say they need a hard salary cap to stop the bleeding. The players say it ain't so, and besides, if some teams on the bottom are really in the red year after year, there are better ways to deal with it than creating more restrictive labor markets.
These issues, now extant in the N.B.A. because of the lockout announced last week, plague labor relations in all the major team sports.
In the N.B.A. and the National Football League, where an explicit salary cap restricts the payroll, the players have every reason to be concerned that team revenue is correctly identified. When the cap was first introduced in the N.B.A. in 1983, Larry Fleisher and the players association were not very sophisticated about the ways owners could hide or rechannel revenue.
The 1983 cap was defined as 53 percent of defined gross revenues, which included only television, radio and gate revenues. Following the 1988 collective bargaining agreement, which defined those revenues as ones "derived from, related to or arising out of the performance of players in N.B.A. basketball games," a dispute arose about what sources of income should be included.
Owners divided luxury box revenue into two parts: the rental payment for the amenities of the comfort and convenience of the box and the ticket price for watching the game. The owners contended that the latter belonged to defined gross revenues and the former did not. This and similar issues led the players to bring an arbitration complaint against the owners, which they won in 1992 with a settlement of some $60 million.
When the 1995 collective bargaining agreement was signed, defined gross revenues was changed to basketball-related income, and the players accepted a lower share in return for a broader definition of revenues applicable to the salary cap. Basketball-related income now includes, for instance, 40 percent of luxury box income, 40 percent of signage (but excludes naming rights according to a curious arbitrator's decision in 1996), a pro rata share of permanent seat licenses and certain related party transactions.
The collective bargaining agreement takes 11 pages to define basketball-related income, and it is still subject to regular dispute. Suppose you are an owner negotiating an arena lease and you are given a choice: pay $2 million in rent and receive 50 percent of a projected $4 million in signage income or pay no rent and receive no money for signage. It might seem that this is a choice between equals, but since the collective bargaining agreement gives 40 percent of signage income to the players, the owner would do better with the option of no rent/no signage. Lease agreements offer manifold opportunities for such juggling, especially when the arena and team are owned by the same person or entity.
Related party transactions are a central component of most teams' finances. For example, if the owner of the team also owns the arena, the arena management company, the concession rights, a local television or radio station, Web pages, local real estate, law or consulting firms that do business with the team, then the owner has tremendous latitude about where to make his or her profits appear.
Abe Pollin, for example, owns the new MCI Center, where both his N.B.A. and N.H.L. teams, the Washington Wizards and the Capitals, play. He can retain arena revenue from naming rights, premium seats, signage, catering, theme activities and so on, in his arena corporation, thereby reducing the revenues earned by his teams by tens of millions of dollars annually. Owners can also pay themselves exorbitant salaries and consulting fees, along with their extensive perks. Thus, Wayne Huizenga, owner of the Marlins, Dolphins, Panthers, Pro Player Stadium, SportsChannel Florida, and arena management and concession ventures can rechannel his teams' revenues to his related businesses, making the world champion Marlins appear to lose money.
When there is a salary cap, such accounting legerdemain comes in handy to directly reduce player payrolls. When there is no cap, owners have still preferred to hide profits to reduce revenue-sharing payments or to argue for larger public subsidies for stadiums, collective bargaining concessions or special treatment under the law.
As the sports industry globalizes, the opportunities for shuffling new income into different businesses will expand and the potential for labor conflict will grow with it.
If the N.B.A. takes in millions of dollars from European or Asian advertisers on its Web page, is this, using the language from the 1995 collective bargaining agreement, revenue that is "derived from, relating to or arising directly or indirectly out of the performance of players in N.B.A. basketball games or in N.B.A.-related activities"?
The trend for media giants to buy up sports franchises so they can control their programming will further complicate matters. When Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox, sends signals for Los Angeles Dodgers games to hundreds of millions of Asian homes and is able to raise subscription or advertising fees on satellite television service, how can baseball players lay any claim to this revenue they help to produce?
How can other team owners include this income in the revenue-sharing base when there is no direct increase in Dodger revenues, especially when 24 major league baseball teams are dependent on Fox-owned stations for their local TV revenue?
These are extraordinarily complex management and organizational issues. Put them together with the issues of competitive balance, single-entity versus monopoly status and idiosyncratic personalities, and you begin to sense the challenges that lie ahead for the business of team sports.
Greater labor-management cooperation is imperative to confront these challenges successfully. Intelligent leadership and sensible public policy, both scarce commodities, would also help.

HEADLINE: A Performing Arts Center Takes a Bow;
In Newark, a Strong First Season Raises Hope

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 5

 BODY:
Pronouncing their first season a rousing artistic success, officials of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center said the center had attracted a large and broad-based audience of half a million people since its opening in October and was sparking interest in revitalizing downtown Newark.
Signs of incipient new life in the city, which even the most optimistic said would take years to materialize, include more than the four new restaurants growing up in the center's shadow or the milling crowds outside the building on show nights. Officials have cited recent purchases of nearby office towers and plans to acquire downtown properties for redevelopment as a turn-of-the-century village by a new foundation financed by the Prudential Insurance Company. A minor-league baseball stadium is under construction and the long-stalled plans for a $75 million riverfront esplanade have been revived with the promise of Federal assistance. 
 "I was wrong in my prediction," said a smiling Lawrence P. Goldman, executive director of the performing arts center, as he recalled his suggestion only last summer that it would be at least two years before redevelopment began to spread from the 12-acre site of the $180 million center.
Still, the center cannot yet claim to have altered the cultural landscape of the metropolitan area, as some grandly predicted it would. Attendance at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York City has not suffered noticeably because of New Jersey defections. And officials of other performing arts and presenting groups said the center has not fostered their fortunes in a state where donations to the arts have remained static.
But it was the audience figures and the filling of 82 percent of its seats over 357 performances in 244 days that was most encouraging to Mr. Goldman and others. It suggested that the center's first season, which ended June 30, was working. Offerings included a broad mix of classical programs with top performers, popular artists like Bob Dylan and David Copperfield, Broadway touring companies of "Annie" and "Grease" and nontraditional and often risky fare from Portugal, Latin America and Africa.
Attendance exceeded projections by 100,000. Of the half million visitors to the center, with its soaring glass facade and red-brick walkways, 26 percent were members of minorities, according to surveys by the arts center. And while 29 percent were from Newark and surrounding Essex County, 70 percent were from suburban areas in Bergen, Union, Morris and Middlesex Counties.
As the new home of the New Jersey Symphony, the center has seemingly unleashed a lot of pent up demand. Subscribers for the touring state symphony's Newark series, which until last season had been held in Symphony Hall, quadrupled from 2,100 to 8,600, said Lawrence Tamburri, executive director of the orchestra. Some of the new subscribers were people who usually patronized symphony programs in scattered sites around the state.
 The results, Mr. Goldman said, have "shattered the two negatives" that shadowed the center's birth as an idea more than a decade ago: that it would not attract suburbanites back to downtown Newark and that blacks and Hispanics who make up the majority of the city would not be drawn to it.
"The numbers tell us that we have succeeded in being a statewide performing arts center," he said, "and succeeded in our ambition to throw open the doors to new audiences."
Bob Stern, an Englewood dentist and longtime subscriber to the symphony, also praised the new center but lamented the loss of some of the annual performances by the orchestra in the John Harms Center for the Arts in his hometown.
"They were sort of cultural room service coming to Englewood, but the truth is that I probably won't travel a lot for room service," he said, noting that he was likely to use the time it takes to go to Newark to travel to Lincoln Center for superior fare.
While some of the apparent success could be the honeymoon effect, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center's first season results, particularly in attracting members of minorities, is drawing some approving and somewhat amazed nods from its peers around the country.
Lawrence Wilker, the president of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, called the 26 percent minority attendance "really good and a testament to the way they have marketed themselves and removed barriers." The New Jersey center, he said, seemed to have avoided the label of an elitist institution from the outset.
Jim Szakacs, the marketing director of the Playhouse Square Foundation in Cleveland, called the first-season results for the New Jersey venue "impressive" and "wonderful" in terms of drawing new audiences and promoting arts education through community programs.
The New Jersey Performing Arts Center is being watched closely for how well it does in holding traditional audiences for the arts, creating new audiences and weaving itself into the fabric of a city's life, said Steve Wolff, president of AMS Planning and Research in Fairfield, Conn., an arts management and audience survey company that has done consulting work for the performing arts center and many of the 28 centers around the country that, like Newark, are in large urban areas, not affiliated with a university and that informally share information.
"They have made it an inviting place and as such the New Jersey center is very much one of the new models of performing arts centers," Mr. Wolff said. "In the first three or four years of performing arts centers there is a lot of learning going on. And the early returns certainly suggest that they have done a lot of things really right."
 
A Centerpiece Of the Community
Examples of how the center has woven itself into life here beyond the performances it presents have been evident recently. On two days last December it held performances of "Cinderella" by the American Ballet Theater in the 2,800-seat Prudential Hall, a Kwanzaa program in the 514-seat Victoria Theater, a bar mitzvah in one of the smaller halls, and the annual cotillion of the Essex County Links, a black service group.
In June, Newark's Science High School held its graduation at the center. And early last month, one of the state's premiere law firms, Sills Cummis Zuckerman Radin Tischman Epstein & Gross, rented the Victoria Theater, where James Carville and Mary Matalin entertained about 400 of the firm's prized clients. The event replaced its annual golf outing to a suburban country club.
Events like these are signs that the Newark center is a place to commemorate important events in people's lives, as much a community center as a cultural pavilion, Mr. Wolff said.
This status has much to do with the 101,000 children, parents and educators who have been served by special daytime performances or the more than 15 arts-training performance development programs, said Philip S. Thomas, the vice president for arts education at the center.
But it is also the result of a mix of programming that has tried to balance the traditional, the popular and the unusual. Stephanie Hughley, the vice president for programming, noted that among the seasons sellouts were Itzhak Perlman, the New Jersey Symphony's "Carmina Burana," Isaac Stern, Yo Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax with the Laredo Quartet. Other sellouts were B. B. King, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Bob Dylan, David Copperfield and the Harlem Nutcracker.
Mr. Goldman noted two setbacks. For one, they discovered too late that there was little appetite for opera on Monday nights among the 4.6 million New Jerseyans within a 25-mile radius. They also found to their disappointment that some of the lucrative pop acts see no need to book performances in Newark if they are booking New York City.
But what he and Ms. Hughley seemed the most proud of was the past season's World Festival. To reach out to Newark's and northern New Jersey's sizable Portuguese-American community, the festival featured performers from Portuguese-speaking countries around the world.
It was a risk artistically, said Ms. Hughley, because although the performers were excellent artists who were popular in their home countries of Mozambique, Portugal or Cape Verde, they were were not known here. Though some of the programs were not as well attended as anticipated, they did bring in varied audiences and had unquantifiable effects.
"I think we created a safe space for people to come and see things that they wouldn't go to see in other places," she said.
Next season's World Festival will focus on pan-African works, including a stage adaptation of "Things Fall Apart," a book by the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, and will introduce American audiences to "Waramba," the French and Mandenka-language opera from Ivory Coast.
Neighbors at other performance halls in the state look at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center's first season with mixed feelings. Their initial fears about the Newark center's impact on their audiences was offset by hopes that they would get a benefit from its programming and that it would raise the level of donations for cultural events statewide, said David Rodriguez, director of the 1,300-seat John Harms Center in Englewood.
Neither of those things has happened he said, but nor do neighboring stages think they have lost audiences to the center.
"They said that they would be a catalyst for greater arts giving in the state," said Mr. Rodriguez, "but the pot of money for the performing arts has not increased."
Both the Englewood center and the State Theater in New Brunswick lost a portion of their New Jersey Symphony dates to the orchestra's new home base in Newark, but officials of both centers said that their overall subscription programs had not suffered.
"We lost a lot of single ticket sales, but we saw an increase in our subscriptions," said David Fleming, director of the State Theater.
 
A Catalyst For Urban Rebirth
By contrast, there has been almost unalloyed enthusiasm about how the center is affecting revitalization in downtown Newark. One clear indication of this was the recent municipal elections in which some candidates who might have been expected to contrast the resources lavished on the center with the amount focused on neighborhoods chose not to do so. Instead, most sought to associate themselves with the center's success and trumpet its possibilities for a broader renewal.
Mayor Sharpe James, who called the rash of new development plans unequivocally an outgrowth of the success of the performing arts center's first season, has reorganized the city government's economic development arm to package development plans and incentives better, as well as to steer some of the expected new largess to local neighborhoods.
Among its tasks will be to review the plans of Prudential's New Newark Foundation, whose conceptual planner is Tony Goldman, a New York real estate developer who is not related to Lawrence Goldman, the performing arts center's president. Tony Goldman, who helped reshape Miami's South Beach into an Art Deco tourist magnet, has been eying downtown Newark for clues to what he calls the city's soul and ways to link it to the $180 million arts center.
"They created this fabulous cultural center and want it to be an economic and inspirational stimulus for the downtown of the state's largest city," he said of the public and private forces that built the center. "I was asked to come in and help stimulate things so that this initiative wouldn't be hanging out there as an oasis, a passive thing, in a development desert."

Map: "Who Fills the Seats"
Since the New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened in Newark last October, audiences have totaled more than 500,000 people, exceeding projections and representing 82 percent of capacity. Significant numbers of visitors came from 13 of New Jersey's 21 counties. The home counties of ticket buyers are reflected in the percentages shown on a map of Northern New Jersey.

Mouse No More, It's Militant Mickey

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France, July 4

 BODY:
Mickey Mouse has been on the picket lines here at Disneyland Paris for almost two weeks. Captain Hook wants more money, and so does Pluto, who says he loves his work but hardly has a bone to gnaw on come the end of the month.
You couldn't hope to find a more wholesome-looking group of French labor militants, all with Disneyland regulation haircuts and cheerfully greeting French, German, Belgian and Italian visitors on their way in for an afternoon of entertainment. 
 "We love working here," said Arnaud M., a 26-year-old Parisian who wears a Pluto costume in the daily parades down Main Street U.S.A. when he's working, but was as reluctant to say so as he was to see his last name published in a newspaper.
"We don't want to spoil the illusion for the kids," he said as he and about 50 fellow strikers, some wearing prisoner costumes with balls and chains, demonstrated cheerfully for higher wages outside the amusement park's main gate. "And I don't want to run the risk of retaliation by management after the strike is over."
French fascination with American popular culture is almost as strong as French attraction to the benefits of the European welfare state, but the clash produced a Disneyland strike as the summer season began -- another summer that the park expects to be profitable, after starting up heavily in the red in 1992.
"Disney asked us to help them out at the beginning by making sacrifices, and we accepted," said Isabelle Perche, a member of the French Christian Workers' Confederation who is a technician at the park. "Now they won't recognize they have an obligation to us."
Euro Disney S.C.A., the company that runs the park, lost nearly $1 billion in the 1992-93 season under American management but then hired a French chief executive, Philippe Bourguignon, and lowered admission prices. It reported a profit of more than $36 million last year, the third consecutive year it was in the black.
Isabelle Clap, a spokeswoman for the company, said it was talking with the striking employees through the weekend in hopes of reaching a settlement. Only 40 out of 13,000 employees were striking Saturday, the company said, not causing any disruptions to its operations, including the parade, which had a full complement of 12 floats.
Few of the 13,000 are union members, Miss Perche said, and none of the parade workers are, though hers is not the only union that has been offering them advice; the Communist General Confederation of Labor has also supported their demands.
"There are a lot of employees who sympathize with the demands they are making," said Miss Perche. She said she earned about $880 a month after payroll deductions and taxes, for a 39-hour week running attractions at the park, barely above the French minimum wage, about $6.75 an hour.
"The Government has raised the minimum wage by about 2 percent a year, so mostly Disneyland has just kept even with that," one of the strikers said.
A youth who said he had played Captain Hook in the parade for five years said there had been as many as 200 Disney employees on the picket line.
"Most of us earn about 7,500 francs a month gross," he said, the equivalent of about $1,250. "What we want is recognition that under French law we should be paid as amusement park performance artists, which would give us about 9,500."
That would be the equivalent of $1,580; French law also requires employers to pay about 40 percent more in payroll taxes and insurance and unemployment benefits, and grant all employees five weeks of paid vacation.
Other amusement parks in France were only seasonal, Arnaud M. (Pluto) said, one of many reasons why he had been happy to stay at Disneyland, open 365 days a year, for seven years though he might have been able to find more lucrative employment elsewhere.
"It's just fantastic to see the expressions on the faces of little kids when you come up to them in your costume and say hello," he said. "I love what I do, but the costumes are hot and heavy in the summer and on cold winter days you freeze, but the show goes on no matter what."
Michel Dompnier, the Disneyland Paris labor relations director, said the company had increased wages by an average of 8 percent over the last three years, above the rate of inflation.
He offered parade performers a chance to make more money by paying them higher salaries when they worked in special shows, for which they would have to audition, and unspecified improvements in working conditions.
The company would also make what he called "an additional effort in the field of training." Miss Perche said permanent employees often found themselves obliged to train temporary hires but were not given extra compensation.
Disneyland employees in the United States probably make more money than their French counterparts by working overtime, Miss Perche said, but French practice is to discourage overtime and create jobs instead. Soon Disneyland, like all other French employers, will have to reduce the work week to 35 hours, with no cut in pay.
"Our way of seeing things is different," she said. "I don't think you can compare the two worlds."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Engine Of Law

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
One of the agreements reached on President Clinton's China visit was to move ahead quickly on what he and President Jiang Zemin called the rule of law initiative. It drew little attention, but it has the potential to be an engine of change in China.
The initiative calls for cooperation between the two countries on the training of lawyers and judges, legal aid for the poor and numerous other subjects. The stated aim is to improve Chinese legal institutions: the courts, law schools, the bar, the administrative bureaucracy. 
 There are detailed plans. But the whole -- the idea -- is more important than the sum of its parts. For thinking about law in a changing China throws interesting light on that society, and on our own understanding of law as an essential condition of freedom.
Law in China? Some Americans will react skeptically to the very notion. What role can law play, they would ask, in an authoritarian state whose Communist Party Government does not tolerate dissent? But that is too simple a view of law's present and potential place in China.
A New York Times correspondent, Elisabeth Rosenthal, described in an April report how more and more ordinary people in China are suing those with power over them: employers, state enterprises, the police. The lawsuits challenge forces that do not usually have to account for the use of their power.
Moreover, the plaintiffs quite often win. That encourages more people to sue, and more lawyers to represent them, even though the law is frequently unclear and the courts unpredictable. The number of lawyers in the country has grown from 2,000 in 1979 to 100,000 today. In the same period the number of law schools has gone from 2 to more than 100.
Why would the leadership want more meaningful legal institutions in China, more law and lawyers? The answer must be found, I think, in the need to which President Jiang gave so much emphasis in his joint press conference with President Clinton: the need for stability.
Anyone who visits China even briefly senses in all kinds of people, in the ruling class and outside, a fear of chaos. It is such a huge and populous country, difficult to hold together under any system. And it has had a recent example of chaos, the Cultural Revolution, that is in just about everyone's mind as a horror that must not be repeated.
Law is the natural antidote to chaos. But arbitrary diktat from the center -- the Maoist sense of law -- does not fit what China has become in recent years. It does not fit a society that encourages the entrepreneurial spirit, that lets people choose where they will work and how they will live.
It has to be a more diverse, more responsive law. That means law administered by courts, developing just rules in the course of deciding individual cases -- as English judges developed the common law of property, contracts and torts, and American judges the law of the Constitution.
Agreed plans will bring Chinese judges to the United States and American judges, including Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, to China. There will be a symposium on legal protection of human rights. American law books will be translated into Chinese. Chinese lawyers will learn about securities regulation and corporate law.
One should not be too romantic about all this. China is not America. Its rulers will want in the end to assure their own position.
And yet, law has a way of working into the bloodstream of a society. It meets the fundamental human desire for both freedom and order.
At Beijing University, President Clinton said: "Freedom strengthens stability. . . . A greater respect for divergent political and religious convictions will actually breed stability." Yes, but it took a long time for us to understand that. Only in the middle of this century did the Supreme Court read the First Amendment to protect dissent. It was a gradual process, the law slowly changing in the direction of freedom.
No doubt the Chinese leadership believes that stronger legal institutions can be confined to economic matters. But Prof. Paul Gewirtz of Yale Law School, who led the planning for the rule of law initiative, said, "I would bet the other way."

HEADLINE: Jiang: Reformer, or the Last of the Apparatchiks?

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
President Clinton, on his trip to China, seemed to think that he had found his Gorbachev in President Jiang Zemin.
The problem is, Mr. Jiang is more likely to be China's Brezhnev -- one of the last leaders of the old Communist regime, far more interested in shoring up the party's monopoly over political power than in dismantling it. 
 Foreign policy analysts and even many of Mr. Clinton's Republican opponents consider the trip to have been very successful, even though Mr. Clinton, in his characteristic effort to empathize with whomever he meets, had some extraordinary words of praise for Mr. Jiang that cut against the grain of the Chinese leader's record and reputation.
But many analysts say Mr. Clinton went too far, even with the usual discount for courtesies allowed a President operating on foreign soil. They say neither Mr. Jiang nor the Chinese Communist Party give any indication that they will change the late Deng Xiaoping's mantra of economic reform as necessarily preceding political reform. Nor was there any deviation from the imperative of single-party Government.
Mr. Clinton called China's course of economic reform and increases in personal liberty "morally right." And in his closing news conference in Hong Kong on Friday, Mr. Clinton lauded Mr. Jiang, a 71-year-old, Soviet-trained engineer and apparatchik, as a man of "imagination," "extraordinary intellect" and "very high energy."
"Profoundly important at this moment in our history when there is so much change going on, he has a good imagination -- he has vision," Mr. Clinton said. "He can imagine a future that is different from the present."
Mr. Clinton also praised Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, an economic reformer, saying: "There's a very good chance that China has the right leadership at the right time."
Others are less convinced.
"Maybe Jiang has whispered some great secret into Clinton's ears," said Peter W. Rodman, a former Nixon and Reagan Administration official now at the Nixon Center. "But I think he's wildly overstating how far this regime is willing to go. Something is opening up in China, and there is more political ferment, but Jiang is a transitional figure. Jiang does not intend the future outcome for which Clinton is already praising him."
Robert Kagan, a critic of Mr. Clinton's China policy at the Carnegie Endowment, says there is too much wishful thinking in Mr. Clinton's words. "Mr. Clinton declaring Jiang as a reformer and a democrat doesn't make it so," Mr. Kagan said. "Have we gone back to believing in reform Communism? The Chinese don't believe in it; why should we?"
The Chinese world view, Mr. Kagan and Mr. Rodman agree, has been shaped by events of 1989 -- within China, with the military crackdown on democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, and in the Soviet Union, where President Mikhail S. Gorbachev destroyed the Communist Party by trying to reform it and, in the process, lost the Soviet empire.
"Jiang and the whole party have gone to school on Gorbachev" as an object lesson, said Mr. Rodman. "Gorbachev's delusion was that a benign form of Communism would be popular in a more pluralist system, and he took away the coercion. But when you take away the coercion, people want the real thing, which is freedom."
But Richard N. Haass, foreign-policy director of the Brookings Institution, gives Mr. Clinton good marks for coating his message in honey.
"His personal support for Jiang is consistent with the posture of encouraging reform, of saying not, 'Tear down this wall, Mr. Gorbachev,' as Reagan did, but very much, 'We are with you, not against you,' " Mr. Haass said.
Despite Mr. Clinton's words, the Chinese model is clear: "economic reform first, then political reform as it comes," Mr. Haass said. So when Mr. Clinton recites the American position, that political reform needs to precede economic reform and is required for that reform to take root, "the Chinese just smile politely and will continue to go their way."
The important moment, Mr. Haass said, is still some time off in the future, "when economic reform requires more political loosening than the political leadership is prepared to provide or to give up."
Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Watch, said that Mr. Clinton "undermined a successful trip at the end by overselling." In Mr. Jendrzejczyk's view, "neither side budged an inch, especially on human rights."
"There is a degree of wishful thinking upsetting to those who want a good relationship with China," Mr. Jendrzejczyk said. "Clinton was there to negotiate as well as communicate, and whether the results justify the praise of Jiang and the endorsement of him as the man who will bring democracy to China is another question. There doesn't seem to be anything to base it on."
The real import of the trip is domestic, said Mr. Haass. "Clinton made an effort to win back control of the domestic debate on China," he said. "This will buy him some time. But the real test for the future is less what happens in China than what happens here. A lot of the praise for him is temporary, and grudging."
Mr. Clinton is already being accused of a form of moral relativism. While no one expects him to adopt the moral shorthand of President Reagan, who called the Soviet Union an "evil empire," Mr. Clinton's tactic of listing American shortcomings while criticizing Chinese human-rights violations grated on numerous ears, Mr. Rodman said.
"Clinton does it whether he's in a town meeting in Detroit or Beijing," Mr. Haass said. "But done in China, there is a degree of equivalence in that message that I find borderline offensive. Whatever our offenses, they are tiny in comparison."

HEADLINE: After a Year, No Letup in Asia's Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
Few alarm bells rang here a year ago this weekend, when Thailand's currency melted down.
"There were no crisis meetings," recalled Daniel K. Tarullo, President Clinton's top international economic adviser until a few months ago, "and certainly no sense that this was the start of an economic crisis that might roll around the world." 
 It turned out to be just that. A year later, there is no end in sight -- after three huge international bailouts, the forced resignation of Asia's longest-serving ruler, a banking crisis in Japan and trouble looming from Russia to South Africa to Malaysia.
The economic crisis that was supposed to be abating now, much as Mexico's did after a year, is growing more intense.
Unlike a nuclear test in India or a provocation from Iraq, this crisis started so slowly that in November, President Clinton dismissed it as "a few small glitches in the road."
Today it stands as the largest single threat to the six-year economic boom in the United States. While the effects on most Americans have been remote, factories are beginning to slow, exports are beginning to pile up on the docks and members of Congress from agricultural states are beginning to call for swift action, even if they are unsure what that action should be.
From the White House to the International Monetary Fund, officials are concerned that the effects of the crisis will be worse and longer lasting than they thought even three months ago. What particularly scares Clinton Administration officials, though they are loath to say so on the record, is that the unpredictable economic contagion is no longer limited to the Pacific Rim.
"Just look at how our view of this has changed in the past year," said one of President Clinton's top advisers. "First it was all about Thailand. Then it was about containing this all to Southeast Asia. And look at where all this is headed in the next year: Russia, Japan, maybe China -- the superpowers."
Mr. Clinton alluded to this fear in Hong Kong on Friday, wrapping up his tour of China. "Restoring economic stability and growth will not be easy," he said. "The steps required will be politically unpopular and will take courage. But the United States will do all we can to help any Asian government willing to work itself back to financial health."
Just what kind of help he has in mind was left vague. He can send Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, on more trips around the globe urging countries to follow the monetary fund's conditions for loans -- a mixture of budget austerity and high interest rates that is now being adjusted to dampen street protests by laid-off workers and by families who cannot buy gasoline or food.
Despite Mr. Clinton's statement of commitment in Hong Kong, his options are limited. Congress is deeply reluctant to contribute an additional $18 billion to the monetary fund. The battle has turned into a bitter struggle over the fund's traditional secrecy, its track record and animosity among some members of Congress toward international organizations of any kind.
Mr. Summers likens denying the fund this money to "canceling your life insurance just after the you've been diagnosed with a life-threatening disease."
But the I.M.F.'s record is mixed at best, and Republicans cite harsh criticism of its actions by everyone from Milton Friedman, the well-known economist, to former Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the fund, dismisses their arguments that the fund has made the crisis worse as "nonsense." But right or wrong, it is a view that is gaining political currency in Washington.
Mr. Clinton has made clear that he has no intention of repeating his own successful bailout of Mexico. In that case, he circumvented Congress, using a fund controlled by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to lend $12 billion to Mexico, one of America's largest trading partners.
It is unclear what the United States will do if Russia desperately needs aid in the next few months and the I.M.F. says it does not have the resources.
It is not only Congress and the Administration that are at odds. The World Bank, which focuses on issues of poverty and development, is critical of its sister institution, the monetary fund. The State Department carps that the Treasury has focused on reforming banking systems and opening markets but has paid too little attention to America's broader strategic interests.
The C.I.A., one senior intelligence official acknowledged, "hasn't a clue how to deal with this kind of crisis, where the enemy is the markets or a finance ministry that lies about a country's currency reserves."
The only point of agreement, in fact, is that Washington officials are publicly understating the depth of the problems so that they do not scare the markets.
"This is off the radar screens in terms of severity," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Primark Decision Systems, an investment advisory group. "It is the single most negative economic event since the Great Depression in the United States.
"But what makes this problem so distinct is that it is not just an economic bust. It is laced with every type of financial crisis and instability that has ever shown up in the real world or any textbook. And while there are some brilliant minds working on it, no one can deal with it -- not Rubin, not Summers, not any single country, not the I.M.F."
Without question, an astounding array of economic and political predictions emerging from Washington and Wall Street in the last year have proven to be wrong.
For example, the Treasury and private economists said last summer that they expected that the problems confronting Thailand would follow the Mexico pattern. The surprise devaluation of the peso triggered sell-offs in other emerging markets, giving rise to the phrase "economic contagion," but after three or four months, markets settled down. After a year of pain, Mexico was on the mend.
But the Asian crisis today looks nothing like Mexico's. The economic contagion has yet to stop. It just smolders underground for a while, erupting in various places around the globe as investors take a new look at a country and suddenly see a host of risks that should have been obvious before. They head for the exits, pulling money out of the currency and the stock markets. That turns long-festering but manageable problems into an immediate crisis.
There were other misguided predictions. When the monetary fund devised a $43 billion bailout plan for Indonesia in October, American officials and the fund described it as deliberate overkill.
Indonesia's economy was in fundamentally better shape than other nations, they said, and President Suharto's iron control over the country made it easier to get the country back on track.
But the economy turned out to be in worse condition than it appeared. And Mr. Suharto resisted the monetary fund's urgings for months, privately telling former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who was sent there on a special mission, "If I do these things, they will throw me out of office."
When Mr. Suharto was forced to resign after riots took 1,200 lives, the Natonal Security Council estimated that his successor, B. J. Habibie, would be gone within weeks. That was two months ago, and Mr. Habibie seems to be settling in.
Then the eruption of Japan's banking crisis sent the yen plunging, and that undercut other currencies througout East Asia.
Fearful of broader contagion, Mr. Rubin reluctantly ordered the United States to buy $2 billion in yen to help calm the markets. In return he received assurances from Japanese politicans that they would act. On Thursday they announced a plan to reform the country's banks.
But the initial verdict from the markets was that the plan was too vague, and the yen plunged again, taking markets throughout Asia with it.
Today Asia faces two big questions. The first is whether Japan will lead a recovery or worsen the pain. The second is whether the monetary fund -- and by extension the Treasury, which has enormous leverage over the fund's policies -- has the right formula.
The fund's solution has been to urge countries to raise interest rates, in hopes of attracting back investors who were fleeing from their currencies, and to balance their budgets. As investors trickle back in, the theory is, interest rates can fall and the currency will gradually strengthen.
That has happened, modestly, in South Korea. But the most common criticism is that high interest rates are killing otherwise healthy businesses and the budget austerity is contributing to shrinking the national economies.
"The year has been a fiasco, and so has the policy," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who has been among the Administration's fiercest critics. "Asia would have been better if the I.M.F. had never set foot in these countries. All these strategies were designed to restore the confidence of the markets, and they didn't."
While many applauded the monetary fund's attack on crony capitalism and particularly on the Suharto-controlled cartels in Indonesia, that effort may not have struck at the heart of the country's economic troubles. But it did build credibility for the fund among the Indonesian people and on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Fischer argue strenuously that if the monetary fund had failed to step in, a bad situation would have turned disastrous.
"It's a balancing act," said Mr. Fischer, "and we constantly readjust the mix to get it right. But I can't believe that serious people believe that without temporarily increasing interest rates, we could have contained the problems" caused by plunging currencies.
The biggest risk to these countries in Asia, Mr. Fischer argues, is not the I.M.F.'s prescriptions, but its rapidly depleting treasury. "If this situation were to worsen," he said, "and we needed to provide additional aid, we would simply not have the resources." The fund has only $10 billion to $15 billion left to lend out before it has to take extraordinary measures, he said.
Opponents in Congress say the fund has plenty of untapped resources and is crying wolf.

HEADLINE: LARGEST H.M.O.'S CUTTING THE POOR AND THE ELDERLY

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
Citing losses and cuts in Government payments, the nation's biggest health maintenance organizations are quitting managed care programs for the poor and elderly.
Their retreat is most pronounced in Medicaid programs. Health care analysts warn of a reversal of Government progress this decade in steering the poor into the mainstream of the health care system, both to provide good care and hold down costs. 
 And advocates for patients say they fear the retreat will mean a return to crowded "Medicaid mill" clinics delivering inferior care.
Managed care organizations like Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Pacificare, Oxford Health Plans, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross and Blue Shield Associations have shut down Medicaid services in at least 12 states, including New York, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
The withdrawals have spread to Medicare-managed programs for the elderly, primarily in rural communities with few patients and where clinics and doctors are scarce. In May, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it was pulling out of Medicare plans in 19 Ohio counties. Last month, Health Net, a large California H.M.O., said it would end its Medicare service in 10 counties.
In other states, H.M.O.'s run by the companies are reducing services to Medicare patients and charging for care that had been fully covered.
But it is Medicaid, whose costs are shared by the Federal Government and the states, and half of whose 32 million recipients are in managed care programs, that has been most affected.
"Medicaid has gone sour" for a lot of H.M.O.'s, said Robert Hurley, an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who is studying the phenomenon. In Medicaid, "the high water mark for commercial H.M.O.'s was probably last year," Professor Hurley said, adding that the withdrawals began then and had been accelerating recently.
Hundreds of H.M.O.'s continue to operate Medicaid programs, and some big ones, like Kaiser and United Healthcare, which have ended the programs in some states, remain committed to programs in others.
Only Utah, with a sparse population and particularly low reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid services, is losing all of its managed care programs for people in those medical plans.
Catherine Halverson, vice president for Medicaid programs at United Healthcare in Minneapolis, which has pulled Medicaid operations out of Ohio and St. Louis, said that the poor are "a population we want to serve."
"We're going to evaluate every opportunity to see if it's something we can participate in," she said.
Some state Medicaid directors acknowledge the trend but say they can live with it. Bruce M. Bullen, the Massachusetts Commissioner for medical assistance and chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, said, "We do see a number of commercial plans taking a second look at the Medicaid market."
But with higher standards for service and quality, and reimbursement rates that he said were competitive, Mr. Bullen added, "we've raised the bar a bit for H.M.O.'s."
Clients who have been shed must find doctors who will treat them for the Medicaid fee, get charity care or go to emergency rooms or to other H.M.O.'s, often ones specializing in Medicaid clients.
More and more of the new plans have been formed by public hospitals and community clinics serving the poor, in effect providing them with a safety net in medical care. The trend toward H.M.O.'s serving Medicaid patients only, consumer advocates and health care analysts warn, portends a return to the low-budget, unmanaged care that the large commercial H.M.O.'s helped remedy.
"We are beginning to watch this," said Sally Richardson, director of Medicaid and State Operations at the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid and Medicare. "The concern is that managed care programs have sufficient alternatives for beneficiaries to have access" to good care.
Most of the withdrawals from Medicaid care have come in the most populous states with large pockets of urban poverty. The Tufts Health Plan dropped out of the Massachusetts Medicaid program two weeks ago, and the state's Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association dropped out in February.
Over the past year, eight organizations, including Aetna U.S. Healthcare and Prudential, have dropped Medicaid programs in New York State. Aetna, the second biggest H.M.O., is also closing them in Connecticut, leaving only New Jersey among states where it provides Medicaid managed care.
Oxford Health Plans, which reported a $291 million overall loss last year, is withdrawing from Medicaid in New Jersey and Connecticut. In March, Kaiser Permanente, the biggest H.M.O., quit Medicaid care in Charlotte, N.C., and last year Humana did so in St. Louis.
Pacificare, the nation's third largest H.M.O., has decided to drop all Medicaid services, closing programs in California, Oregon and Utah. At least three companies have left Florida and two are in receivership.
The withdrawals highlight the dashed expectations of both the companies, for attractive profits from Government-financed managed care, and the Government, for sharp reductions in the cost of care.
Like industry, which has steered 85 percent of the work force into managed care, the states and the Clinton Administration are trying to contain the cost of care, but they are driving a harder bargain.
While businesses have generally frozen payments to H.M.O.'s for four years and are allowing increases of about 5 percent this year, some states have slashed payments since the mid-1990's by up to 20 percent.
Before most of the cuts took effect, the H.M.O.'s rushed into managed care plans for Medicaid recipients. From less than 10 percent, or 2.7 million of 28.3 million Medicaid beneficiaries in 1991, they captured 48 percent, or 15.4 million, of the 32.1 million beneficiaries in 1997.
But as the states cut reimbursement rates for Medicare, the organizations suffered growing losses. "These ambitions of enormous savings have proven to be totally unrealistic," Paul Offner, the District of Columbia's Commissioner for health care finance, said of Government expectations.
As a result, said Bruce M. Fried, a health care lawyer in Washington and until earlier this year the director of the Clinton Administration's Office of Managed Care: "Some of the best plans have said, 'We can't do business on this basis. We're going to have to leave the system.' "
Some health care organizations acknowledge some naivete in embarking on Medicaid managed care. "We had not been in the Medicaid market, and the decision was made to expand into it," said Richard Hannon, senior vice president for marketing at Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Phoenix. "We considered it good to serve a broad range of Americans."
So in 1994, Blue Cross was awarded a three-year contract and enrolled 45,000 Medicaid recipients. Offered a new contract last year, the company balked after large losses. "We got out because we found it extremely difficult to manage that patient base," Mr. Hannon said.
Richard Potter, deputy director of Arizona's Medicaid program, said: "They had a big learning curve. They bid a rate. There were others at that rate that were able to survive."
Difficulties in serving Medicaid beneficiaries are not limited to inexperienced H.M.O.'s. Maura Bluestone is the director of the Bronx Health Plan in New York, which has 38,000 subscribers, 80 percent of whom are Medicaid patients.
"Reimbursement is a real difficult issue," Ms. Bluestone said. New York State chopped its reimbursements to the plan by 24 percent in 1995, she said. Part of the reduction was subsequently restored. Still, before the cuts, Bronx Health Plan was receiving $200 a month to care for each enrolled adult, 21 to 64 years old, while it now receives $164, or 18 percent less.
She said the state had also raised the quality-of-care standards it required the plans to meet, raising the cost of care. "In a way," she said, "it's a setup for failure."
Mathematica Policy Research, a private organization, reports that the number of managed care organizations with Medicaid contracts climbed to 355 in 1996 from 166 in 1993. But among them, those serving Medicaid clients exclusively or primarily rose to 44 percent from 39 percent.
The shift can be good for the poor, said Sara Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University here, because they benefit from access to well-run organizations experienced in treating them.
But Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, sees the trend more ominously. H.M.O.'s that serve only the poor are unable to shift profits from serving healthier clients to the poor, as more diverse H.M.O.'s do, Ms. Rowland said.
As a result, when reimbursement rates are cut, she said, the Medicaid-only H.M.O.'s become especially vulnerable. "There's no way to cost shift," she said, "and that's where you start to see real skimping on care."
The more recent H.M.O. retreat from Medicare managed care services poses few such quality-of-care issues for the elderly. Dr. Robert Berenson, director of the Health Care Financing Administration's Center for Health Plans and Providers, said about one million elderly beneficiaries are joining managed care plans each year and that he is rapidly approving new plans to meet a growing demand.
"The overall trend is for expansion," Dr. Berenson said.
But in Medicare, too, the health organizations are scrutinizing the marketplace to avoid more losses. They note that increases in their Government reimbursements have slowed to 2 percent a year, below the rate of health care inflation.
"The cost in many markets is well north of that," said David Olson, spokesman for Foundation Health Systems in Woodland Hills, Calif., the parent of Health Net. In addition to the 10 counties Health Net is abandoning, he said, "We're closely examining our participation in several different markets."

The Latin Left Searches for a Practical Agenda

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
The program of the political left in Latin America has varied sharply in recent decades. The left has called for armed struggle, protected industries, nationalization, subsidies -- different plans but always a plan -- until now. Today, the left knows it opposes what Latins call neoliberalismo, the region's singleminded pursuit of foreign investment and the accompanying austerity and inequality. But leftists have no clear idea what they are for.
Neoliberalism's rise to the status of near-religious doctrine in Latin America is due in part to the influence of Washington. The Reagan Administration pushed the Latin Americans into pro-business austerity policies, and set the tone for a worldwide reduction of government's role. The policy's acceptance in Latin America is due also to the wealth of its backers in a region where money matters even more in politics than it does in the United States. 
 But neoliberalism is also a response to the failures of the left. The continent is still cleaning up the hyperinflation and stagnation born of the left's irrational public spending and closed economies.
Now, however, the left must fix the flaws of neoliberalism -- chiefly that it is not helping the poor. If government does not spread the benefits of globalization, countries will be divided into a small group of wealthy businessmen and a large group of marginalized people who cannot even get an antibiotic or a grade-school education.
The left's traditional solutions do not apply. Armed struggle, thankfully, is out of fashion. Most of the state telephone companies and steel mills the left created were wasteful and corrupt and did little for the poor. Closing markets has mainly protected an inefficient national class of cronies. Many of the left's traditional causes served the middle class, such as university students, government employees and urban hospitals, while ignoring the needs of the less vocal and organized poor.
There is a growing consensus, both among governments and the international banks that lend to them, that at a minimum, governments must put a human face on neoliberalism by spending money on the poor. Chile is the only country that is really trying this, and the only country to reduce poverty by a significant amount in recent years. It has done so by sustaining 7 percent growth for 10 years, and by spending a lot of money on the poor in programs administered by what is probably the region's least corrupt and most effective government. Other nations will not be able to duplicate this success. Even in Chile, moreover, inequality has risen, and the country's growth, heavily dependent on the export of its fish and forests, is not sustainable.
If neoliberalism lite is not the solution, what is? Some possible ideas are coming from a group organized by Jorge Casteneda, a Mexican political scientist, and Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a Brazilian who teaches law at Harvard. Over the last several years, they have drawn together a few dozen of Latin America's leading politicians -- mostly leftists -- to discuss alternatives.
Mr. Unger argues that government has a role, although a very different one than in the past. He and Mr. Casteneda believe that instead of simply spending money to reduce the suffering of the silent majority, governments must pursue locally designed policies to draw the poor into the global economy. They also stress the need to collect taxes. While developed countries collect taxes equivalent to 30 percent of their economies, in Latin America the figure is 12 percent -- not enough to finance even a meager social safety net.
Their more radical proposals include a measure that would allow either the president or the legislature to call new elections for both branches, a way to break the deadlock that now keeps many countries from passing reforms.
Their agenda has its quirks, but at least it is a serious attempt to draw up a program to make the market work for the poor. The program must be pragmatic enough to attract those in the political center but radical enough to make a real difference in people's lives and not simply be a pale copy of the right. It is a problem that grips Russians trying to break the domination of the tycoons and South African officials desperate to improve the lot of poor blacks. As America's prosperity continues to leave out large segments of society, the question of how to close that gap is one the Democratic Party will have to answer as well.

Asian Crisis Looms Large But Recognition Was Slow
A year ago, Thailand's currency melted down, starting an economic crisis in Asia that led to three huge international bailouts, the forced resignation of Asia's longest-serving leader and a banking crisis in Japan. The crisis, which at first rang few alarm bells in the United States, now stands as the largest single threat to the economic boom Americans have been enjoying for the last six years. Officials say the impact could be greater than they expected even a few months ago. A1

H.M.O.'s Abandon Plans For the Poor and Elderly
Citing losses and cuts in Government payments, the nation's biggest health maintenance organizations are quitting managed care programs for the poor and elderly. Organizations like Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Pacificare, Oxford Health Plans, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross and Blue Shield Associations have shut down Medicaid services in at least 12 states, including New York, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts and Connecticut. A1
 
Teachers Defeat Union Merger
Delegates at the National Education Association's convention voted overwhelmingly against merging with the American Federation of Teachers, frustrating plans to create a create a unified voice to fight what union leaders see as an unprecedented assault against public education. The vote would have created the largest union in American history, with 3.3 million members. A1
 
Proffitt's to Acquire Saks
Saks Fifth Avenue, one of the most venerable names in retail, said yesterday that it would be acquired for $2.1 billion by Proffitt's Inc., a Southern retailing company that is all but unknown to New York shoppers.The proposed deal would represent the end of an era for Saks, whose founders, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel, would likely never have imagined that the famous store on natty Fifth Avenue would one day be part of a retail conglomerate based in Alcoa, Tenn. A1
 
Politics Is Local This Year
This year's battle for control of the House is being fought the old-fashioned way -- candidate by candidate and district by district -- and could depend less on sweeping political themes than on a chain of local circumstances like the decision by Representative Wes W. Watkins, Republican of Oklahoma, not to retire after all. Only 65 House races are even considered truly competitive and with the Republicans holding one of the slimmest majorities this century, the Democrats need a net gain of just 11 seats to reclaim control.

Reclaiming Ground in Florida
Even as wildfires raged in counties in northeastern and central Florida, firefighters, blessed with scattered showers, less wind and higher humidity over the weekend, began gaining ground in fire-ravaged areas. As the smoke cleared, residents returned to find the result of the roaring flames that had forced evacuations in scenes that have haunted the state since May. A1
 
Smokers' Class-Action Test
The resolve of cigarette makers to fight lawsuits following the collapse of last year's national settlement plan faces its toughest test today with the start of a massive class-action case brought on behalf of smokers in Florida. The case, in which an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people are seeking some $100 billion in compensatory and punitive damages, is the first class-action lawsuit involving smokers to come to trial.

Foster Mother Is Arrested In Starvation of a Toddler
A day after the discovery of a severely malnourished 2-year-old boy on Staten Island, the child's foster mother was arrested as she returned home from a long holiday weekend, and a horrendous picture began to emerge of the life of a baby who had apparently been isolated, neglected and starved. The boy, Dennis Davis, who will be 3 on Sept. 15 but weighs only 18 pounds -- less than half the normal weight of a child of his age -- was in stable condition. The foster mother, Deanna Allston, 31, who had left Dennis hidden in a back room, and four other foster children with her 19-year-old brother on Thursday for what she said was an overnight trip, was charged with reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child.

Tourism Grows in Brooklyn
In the latest wrinkle in a buoyant surge of tourism that has swept New York for more than two years, Brooklyn, that historically rich, much maligned, widely misunderstood place that the Dodgers, Barbra Streisand and Woody Allen left, is suddenly on the itinerary. The emergence of Brooklyn as tourist destination -- or at least an excursion for visitors to Manhattan -- is evident in the growing popularity of its cultural institutions, and in large new investments in its tourism and lodging businesses, like the sleek, 376-room Marriott that is to open on Tuesday as Brooklyn's first large new hotel in 68 years. B1
 
The Mayor and Free Speech
In his pursuit of a "civilized" New York of small-scale protests and huckster-free sidewalks, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani keeps bumping up against the First Amendment and getting bruised. The constitutional guarantee of free expression and assembly has been invoked in about a dozen lawsuits that successfully challenged the Mayor's quality-of-life initiatives and in reaction to his often testy confrontations with critics.The courts have not passed judgment on the Mayor's vision for the city or on his temperament but they have found fault with the way the city regulates activities protected by the First Amendment.

Hard Fight in G.O.P. Primary
When John M. Gangemi Jr. undertook his first political campaign for State Senate two years ago, he was warmly embraced by Republican Party officials in Brooklyn and Staten Island. But this time, the 29-year-old manager of health care centers has received not a single political endorsement. Instead, Republican officials are rallying behind Christopher J. Mega, a 67-year-old former State Senator who recently stepped down as the presiding judge of New York State's Court of Claims. Mr. Gangemi is planning to announce this week that he is again running to represent the 23d Senate District, providing something that is a rarity in overwhelmingly Democratic New York City: a hard-fought Republican primary.

California State University, the nation's largest college system, has scuttled a much-disputed plan to accept a $300 million investment from a group of high-technology companies to upgrade the university's networks and other technology infrastructure.

Digital Video Disk Rivals
The companies backing DVD, the CD-size digital disk that contains a feature-length movie, are boasting a lot these days, telling anyone who will listen that their product is selling faster than either compact disk players or VCR's did at the corresponding points after they were introduced. But DVD is sprinting to gain a foothold ahead of two headstrong rivals: Divx, an upstart hybrid DVD format that went on sale last month in Richmond and San Francisco, and digital cable television, which is expected to make picture-perfect, digital, pay-per-view movies a ubiquitous feature in homes.

HEADLINE: A Nice Place to Visit;
A Hotel! Bus Tours! Brooklyn Hits the Tourist Map

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In Manhattan, sure. But Brooklyn? Still, there they are, those big red double-decker tourist buses chugging past Fulton Landing, around Grand Army Plaza and in the shadow of the sleek, 376-room Marriott that is to open Tuesday as Brooklyn's first large new hotel in 68 years.
"Everybody has heard something about Brooklyn," said Claudia Pongratz, a tourist from Munich, Germany, who squeezed onto the upper level of a double decker the other day with other first-time visitors to New York City's most populous borough, most of them from Europe. "It is part of America I have always wanted to see." 
 In the latest wrinkle in a buoyant surge of tourism that has swept New York for more than two years, Brooklyn, that historically rich, much maligned place of 2.3 million people that the Dodgers, Barbra Streisand and Woody Allen left, is suddenly on the itinerary. At least for an intrepid few.
Brooklyn business people, and the visitors themselves, offer several reasons for the borough's new popularity. As in much of the city, fear of crime has subsided. Many North American visitors can trace ancestors to Brooklyn, travelers from Europe are attracted by the elegance and history of the borough's brownstones and churches, and many tourists come simply for a brief glimpse of traditional, middle-income residential areas in a city normally defined by the extremes of architecture, finance and human relations.
"They want to see where we live, and get a feeling for our ethnicity," said JoAnne Meyers, manager of the Brooklyn Tourism Council, a four-year-old group whose Web page (http://www.brooklynx.org/whoweare/tourism) has been attracting hits in recent months from across Europe, Argentina, Israel and Japan.
"We are like a human zoo," she said. "Everybody wants to come and see how we live together because we do it so well."
Whatever the attraction, the emergence of Brooklyn as a tourist destination -- or at least an excursion for visitors to Manhattan -- is evident in the growing popularity of its cultural institutions, and in large new investments in its tourism and lodging businesses.
Foremost among them is the new Marriott, in downtown Brooklyn next to Metrotech, the office and university complex that was built in the 1980's as one of New York City's most sweeping urban renewal projects. The hotel fills the lower seven floors of a 32-story building, where the higher floors -- and unbroken views of Manhattan -- are claimed by the office of the Brooklyn District Attorney, an insurance company and other business tenants.
The hotel is intended mainly as a destination for business travelers because of its proximity to Metrotech. Its large underground garage will allow easier access by car than most Manhattan hotels, and Marriott says its weeknight room rates of $180 to $230 are at least 20 percent below those at comparable hotels in Manhattan.
But Marriott executives said they planned to promote the hotel aggressively to tourists.
"Tourism is already catching on in Brooklyn, and we think we can spur a lot more," said Mitchell Heymann, director of marketing for the hotel, formally the New York Marriott Brooklyn, which has booked almost all its rooms next weekend for a convention of black businesswomen. He said that group might provide an example of the kind of guests who would enhance Brooklyn's reputation as a tourist stop, because they could be expected to explore neighborhoods elsewhere in the borough.
Marriott's nearest competitor in Brooklyn is the 150-room Golden Gate Motor Inn in Sheepshead Bay. Long gone are the opulent hotels in Brooklyn Heights that rivaled those of Manhattan, like the towering St. George, completed in 1930 and now a cooperative apartment house, and the 90-year-old Bossert, which attracted movie stars in the 1920's, and is now a residential building owned by the Jehovah's Witnesses.
To fill the lodging void, bed-and-breakfasts have sprung up in several of the borough's best preserved brownstone neighborhoods.
"People used to come with some trepidation, but now they are enthralled," said Harry Paul, owner of the Baisley House, a two-year-old Carroll Gardens bed-and-breakfast inn in a 145-year-old brownstone once owned by Susan Hayward. The largest share of the inn's clientele is made up of European tourists and American business travelers, he said, and demand is so strong for the three guest rooms that he is already taking weekend reservations for 1999.
The growing number of Brooklyn visitors has provided a lift for the borough's largest cultural institutions, including the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Aquarium. The borough's rising cultural star, at least over the last year, has been the Brooklyn Museum of Art, where attendance has doubled.
"I think we are at a major turning point for tourism in Brooklyn, and this building is bustling," said Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the museum, where attendance had declined for years until it bottomed out at about 255,000 a year -- dismally low for a major art museum -- through most of the last decade.
But in the last year, she said, the combination of heightened interest among tourists and two hugely popular exhibitions -- paintings by Monet and the museum's current show, "Jewels of the Romanovs," which ends next Sunday -- have created a surge of attendance. Although attendance figures for the fiscal year that ended June 30 are still being tallied, she said it would easily exceed 500,000.
Still, for all its historic, ethnic and cultural appeal, Brooklyn remains primarily a residential place, not ideally suited for oversized buses rumbling down the block or tour groups peering into people's living rooms.
"We love the tourists, but they are just going to have to visit us on foot," said Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, a homeowners' group that for years has resisted efforts by tour operators to drive their buses along the neighborhood's somnolent side streets, or to park at the entrances to the scenic Brooklyn Heights promenade.
"This neighborhood was laid out with dirt lanes in the 19th century," she said. "There is simply no room for tour buses."
Such resistance has done much to influence the tours now being offered in Brooklyn by Manhattan's two biggest double-decker bus operators, Gray Line Tours and New York Apple Tours.
Gray Line, which for years has offered an excursion to the promenade on summer nights, agreed this year for the first time to park its buses at a staging area blocks away. But in response to a surge in tourist demand, it has also expanded its service from one to three buses each night, with tour guides speaking French, German, Italian and Spanish.
By far the largest new tour service is by New York Apple Tours, which started Brooklyn trips in May and now has buses regularly making a broad circuit from the waterfront under the Brooklyn Bridge to the Botanic Garden on Eastern Parkway and back through Brooklyn's downtown commercial district.
"It has been so popular we are already planning to increase the frequency of buses," said Hayim Grant, New York Apple Tours' president. On weekday afternoons, when buses now run every hour, he said, they will soon run every half an hour.
Still, Mr. Grant's company, yielding to pressure from Brooklyn residents, has plotted its tours in a way that may leave some visitors feeling that they have missed the best of the borough. Avoiding side streets, including those with the most well-preserved 19th century buildings, the New York Apple buses remain on wide thoroughfares like Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, lined on many of their blocks by undistinguished and sometimes rundown commercial buildings.
Although the double-decker service is intended to allow people to get off and walk, returning to board another bus at the next scheduled stop, few of those on the tour taken by Ms. Pongratz the other day ventured off the bus. Nor were they encouraged to do so by New York Apple's tour guide, whose enthusiastic descriptions of such unremarkable buildings as the Fire Department headquarters seemed to elicit little interest from those on the top deck.
"I have been to Brooklyn, but I think I missed it," said Jozsef Karaszi, a telecommunications executive from Budapest who took the tour with his wife and son as part of a four-day New York City visit.
For his part, Mr. Grant acknowledged that rough edges in the Brooklyn tour remain to be worked out.
"There is a learning process that takes place with every new service," he said. "In Brooklyn, it will be very important to tell visitors where to get off and walk around, and we will get better at that as our employees become more knowledgeable."

HEADLINE: Absent a Battle Cry, War for the House Is Fought at Home

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
After two Congressional elections that were seen as referendums on the direction of the nation, this year's battle for control of the House is being fought the old-fashioned way: candidate by candidate and district by district.
In a year marked by a pro-incumbent contentment with the economy, only 65 House races are even considered by the political parties to be truly competitive. Yet with the Republicans holding one of the slimmest majorities of this century, the Democrats need a net gain of just 11 seats to reclaim control of the House. 
 Those numbers mean that Representative Newt Gingrich's longevity as Speaker could depend less on sweeping political themes than on a chain of local circumstances: the decision by Representative Wes W. Watkins, Republican of Oklahoma, not to retire after all, or the question of whether voters in Hawaii decide to punish Democrats, like Representative Neil Abercrombie, for the local economic recession.
"This time you don't have a Presidential race going on and you don't have a national wave one way or another," said Representative Martin Frost of Texas, the chairman of the House Democrats' election committee. "So it's really trench warfare, district by district."
Candidates across the nation are still striking certain common chords. Democrats, for instance, are riding the overhaul of managed health care as a central campaign theme.
"There are key issues out there that are going to have an impact," said Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, one of the Democrats the Republicans consider potentially vulnerable this year. "The one I'm focusing on is managed care reform. And I think people will respond because they think this is a do-nothing Congress that is not focusing on key issues."
Mr. Gingrich sent his incumbents out to campaign over the July 4 Congressional recess on a message of tax-cutting. Representative John Linder, the Georgian who heads the Republicans' re-election effort, said his party will be stressing "that we have balanced the budget with tax cuts and put people back to work" who had been on welfare.
But for the first time in almost a decade, the words of the late House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill seem most apt: "All politics is local." Strategists for the two parties sense none of the anti-Washington animus that gave a national cast to recent elections, when voters rallied against a recession, entrenched incumbents or legislative overreaching.
"Ninety-four was an election where the Republicans didn't want to talk about anything but Bill Clinton," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, "ninety-six an election where Democrats didn't want to talk about anything but Newt Gingrich. Ninety-eight will be a different kind of election where candidates talk about each other. There's not a single issue that's driving the election from border to border and coast to coast."
In their drive to hold the majority that they won in 1994, Republicans have history on their side. Traditionally, the party in the White House loses seats in its sixth year in office. And Republicans are forecasting at least a 10-seat gain in November.
Some Republican incumbents, though, are being forced to struggle for their seats. Representative Constance A. Morella, a moderate Maryland Republican, is thought to be facing the strongest, most well-financed challenger of her six terms in Ralph Neas, the former executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
Mr. Neas has accused Ms. Morella of moving to the right during her years in office. After appearing at a Fourth of July parade this weekend, however, Ms. Morella said that by putting an emphasis on health care, technology issues and education, she was a "good mirror of my district."
Democrats see several reasons why they may be able to defy history, starting with the fact that the year's retirements from Congress left them with fewer vulnerable open seats than the Republicans. They also boast some well-financed candidates who may be able to overcome the Republicans' usual advantage in raising money. Even Republicans concede that the voters' "six-year itch" for change may have come four years early, in 1994, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in nearly 50 years. And, since 1980, no President has had coattails guaranteed to sweep a marginal candidate into office.
"With an 11-seat margin, one or two breaks the right way can make the big difference," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist.
There is no better barometer of how small events can make a difference in the electoral math this year than the sharp mood swings among House Republicans.
They started the year confident of a serene election, then began to panic in late spring that they could lose the House. Now, they have been bolstered by a handful of recent developments that have even nonpartisan campaign handicappers like Stuart Rothenberg and Charlie Cook calling it unlikely that the Democrats can take the majority.
For one, Republican leaders made a successful appeal to Mr. Watkins of southern Oklahoma to reconsider his plans to retire. Mr. Watkins, a longtime Democrat who changed parties and ran for Congress as a Republican in 1996, was considered the sole Republican who could hold a seat so Democratic that his district was long ago dubbed "Little Dixie."
In addition, the California primary in June saw the triumph of two moderate Republicans who are considered the party's strongest candidates to run in districts in Sacramento and the Los Angeles area, now held by Democrats Vic Fazio, who is retiring, and Jane Harman, who made an unsuccessful bid for her party's gubernatorial nomination.
And in a special election in Albuquerque, N.M., to replace Representative Steven H. Schiff, who died, a Republican, Heather Wilson, held the seat for her party, after a Green Party candidate siphoned votes from Phil Maloof, the Democrat.
"We expect to have some momentum from this," Mr. Linder said. Democrats still say they can secure a majority of the 435 House seats by winning 8 of the 10 most competitive seats being vacated by Republicans and then defeating nine of the weakest Republican incumbents. That still leaves room for the Democrats to lose a handful of their own seats.
The Republicans counter that they can increase their majority by at least 10. They are counting on winning 5 of the seats where Democratic incumbents are retiring and defeating 10 other Democrats.
Those calculations allow them to lose as many as five seats, although Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the Republican election effort, said, "Our folks really believe that unless something dramatic happens we won't lose a single incumbent."
Both parties are focusing on freshman lawmakers who are less entrenched, like Representative Vince Snowbarger, a Kansas Republican, and Representative James H. Maloney, a Connecticut Democrat. Democrats and Republicans are also fighting hardest in swing districts that are seeing the retirement of incumbents, particularly in the Middle West and along the West Coast.
In California alone, eight seats are considered competitive. The politically volatile North Coast California district where Representative Frank Riggs is retiring could be one of the most difficult for the Republicans to retain. State Senator Mike Thompson, a Democrat, is opposing Mark Luce, the Napa County supervisor.
But Democrats are likely to have trouble keeping the California seats of Mr. Fazio and Ms. Harman. The districts lean Republican and the nomination of two moderate Republicans who support abortion rights, Doug Ose, a businessman, and Assemblyman Steven Kuykendall, is thought to give Republicans an edge. They face Sandie Dunn, a lawyer, and Janice Hahn, a businesswoman.
In some states, the Republicans are counting on popular governors at the top of the ticket to carry weak incumbents. Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania is expected to help Representative Jon D. Fox of the Philadelphia suburbs. Mr. Fox won by only 84 votes in 1996 over Joseph M. Hoeffel, and had to come through a primary fight this spring. Mr. Hoeffel, a county commissioner, is challenging him again.
Democrats say they will be able to do well in some unexpected places, because this year their candidates better match the philosophy of their districts. In an open seat in Kentucky, for example, the Democrat, Ken Lucas, is a county judge who is an anti-abortion social conservative. He faces Republican State Senator Gex Williams.
The campaign year might yet turn more volatile in its last weeks. In 1994, the collapse of President Clinton's health care plan and the legislative maneuvering over the crime bill late in the Congressional session helped propel the Republicans into the majority. And two years ago, the support for the Democrats began to drop as questions about President Clinton's campaign financing emerged in late October.
A wild card for both parties is the course of the investigation of Mr. Clinton by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel. "The big question none of us has been able to answer," said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist, "is what happens with the scandal?"

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook: The Right to Perform, the Right to Compose;
Loss of 'Peony' and Players

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
With much of Tibetan culture put at risk by actions of the Chinese Government, it may seem petty and impertinent to fret about the fate of Chinese opera; even more, about one particular corner of it. But Chinese opera, which has long been the central manifestation of the performing arts in China, deftly combining music, drama, poetry, dance, design and acrobatics, is waning. And Kunqu opera, the revered style that began in Kunshan, near Shanghai, in the 14th century and gave birth to so many later varieties, including the dominant Peking opera, appears to be dying. Really dying, not just wallowing in confusion, as so much of Western classical music is doing.
That sober reality was hard to credit for a recent visitor to Shanghai, seeing the remarkable talent, energy, imagination and love being lavished on rehearsals for the ground-breaking production of the Kunqu classic "The Peony Pavilion" that was to have formed the crown jewel of the Lincoln Center Festival, which opens this evening. As Chen Shi-Zheng, the gifted American director now at the center of a storm, put the mostly young performers of the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company through their paces, the gorgeous costumes arrived bit by bit, handmade in classic fashion by elderly seamstresses in nearby Suzhou, the site of a Kunqu museum. Despite the dinginess of the surroundings, on the fifth floor of a municipal building in the old French quarter of Shanghai, the process seemed one of growth and vitality. 
 But it is suddenly easier to comprehend the dire predictions now that the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has at the last minute denied the company permission to travel to New York. And it seems clear that the final, fatal blows to Kunqu are being delivered by the very people who proclaim themselves its protectors.
"This is a precious piece of Chinese culture," Ma Bomin, the director of the bureau, rightly says of "The Peony Pavilion," written by Tang Xianzu in 1598 and considered one of the great masterpieces of Chinese literature. Yet that epic drama lay mostly unperformed for centuries, typically represented by an occasional presentation of 1 or 2 of the most famous of its 55 scenes.
The impetus for the Lincoln Center production, which was to have presented the work at its full 20-hour length, seemingly for the first time in at least three centuries, came not from China but from an American, John Rockwell, when he was the director of the Lincoln Center Festival. Mr. Rockwell, who is now the editor of the Arts and Leisure section of The New York Times, is expert in Wagnerian opera, and his curiosity about "The Peony Pavilion" led him to conceive the "Ming Ring," as he called it: a presentation of the complete work in six parts, over six nights or three days. He was also fascinated by the possibility of applying Western methods of early-music research and notions of "authentic" interpretation to this repertory, and he enlisted Mr. Chen, who has lived in New York since he left his native China in 1987.
Here, whatever its origins, was a prime opportunity to inject new life into Kunqu by giving it unprecedented international exposure. The production was to be showcased not only in New York but also at festivals in Paris, Sydney and Hong Kong, and probably released on audio and video. And this at a time when another version of "The Peony Pavilion," directed by Peter Sellars in a truncated and Westernized form, is traveling the globe.
 
The Objections To Changing a Work
Now Mr. Chen's production has been derailed by Ms. Ma, who deemed it unworthy to represent Kunqu tradition and, significantly, modern China to the world. No matter that the largely oral tradition has itself strayed far from whatever Kunqu may originally have been. It is as if someone had been able to decree early in this century that Handel's "Messiah" should be performed only as it had emerged from Victorian England, with bloated chorus and orchestra and perhaps even a few of Thomas Beecham's bells and whistles.
Then, too, one specific at issue was the brief appearance of a prop, a chamber pot, which was alleged to make China appear backward. Yet as Mr. Chen points out, during the Song dynasty, in which the opera is set, or even the Ming, in which it was written, a chamber pot would have been anything but backward.
This was one of four scenes the bureau took issue with in a recent preview. In another, Mr. Chen was accused of injecting superstition by staging a funeral march for the heroine and burning effigies, in line with Chinese folk tradition. In the two other scenes, the material objected to -- the "pornography" of the scene in which Sister Stone tells why, anatomically, she could only be a virgin, and the mocking treatment of a drunken Tartar general -- came directly from the classic text.
After Mr. Chen expressed a willingness to make adjustments, the bureau's censors took the production back into rehearsal and demanded changes in six more scenes. Even then, Mr. Chen said on Friday on his return to New York, "if that would get approval for the performers to leave, I would have done it." But when Ms. Ma walked out on the rehearsal she attended, it became apparent that no amount of compromise would suffice to liberate the production.
Some have suggested that the real reason for refusing to permit the company to travel was a fear of defections. Indeed, the last time this company visited the United States -- Los Angeles, in 1989 -- 8 of the 20 members defected. Several are part of the Kunqu Society in New York. Those who stayed with the company are now the wise old masters on whom Mr. Chen, whose training was largely in other forms of Chinese opera, relied for the niceties of Kunqu. "The practitioners are the real experts," he said, dismissing the "experts" who found his work wanting.
In anticipation of the New York trip, the bureau obtained signed affidavits from the performers' families promising that if an individual did not return, the family would forfeit $12,000, no small amount by Chinese standards.
Whatever the ultimate reasons for detaining the production and however great the loss for Western audiences, the real damage has occurred in China. Eight months of painstaking rehearsal and the exquisite work of innumerable craftsmen have evidently gone for naught, and brilliant young performers have been denied brighter futures.
"Their spirits are totally broken down," Mr. Chen said. If so, it is a calamity for those were clearly strong and vibrant spirits, well suited to the lively characters they were to play.
In "The Peony Pavilion," Du Liniang, the susceptible teen-age heroine, finds a dashing lover in a dream and pines to her death for lack of the reality. But she is resurrected when the embodiment of that lover, Liu Mengmei, a young scholar, discovers her portrait and reciprocates her love. Though the work is set in the Song dynasty (960-1279), its concerns relate at least as much to Tang Xianzu's era, as Ben Wang, a Kunqu expert in New York, explained in a captivating series of lectures at the China Institute in connection with the Lincoln Center Festival. The playwright was especially intent on espousing freedom and initiative in his heroine at a time when Neo-Confucianism found young women suited only to idleness and subservience.
Qian Yi, lovely in a shy and understated way at 22, was to have played Beautiful Du, as the name can be translated. Zhang Jun, tall and charismatic at 23, was to have played Mengmei. Both were members of the last class to have graduated from the Shanghai Kunqu Opera School: possibly the last class ever. In 1986, they were among the 60 students accepted from 20,000 applicants for the eight-year program. When the school recruited for the next class, recently, there were not enough applicants to form one.
Interest in all forms of Chinese opera has eroded in the last decade under a wave of American pop culture and Western arts, including opera. Kunqu, the most refined of the 360 or so types of Chinese opera, has been especially hard hit. Kunqu melody grows directly out of the pitch characteristics of Chinese speech, with its four tones: high, low, rising and falling. And just as speech is elevated to song, movement is elevated to dance, with special significance given to curving motion, since, for the Chinese, the circle represents the perfect union of opposites, the yin and the yang.
Increasingly, parents limited by national social policy to producing a single child are reluctant to consign that child to so rarefied and uncertain an enterprise. The Shanghai company is one of six Kunqu troupes surviving in China, and performances are infrequent and ill attended. The performers are paid less than $100 a month.

What's Next for Performers? They Wonder Themselves
When Ms. Qian and Mr. Zhang, obviously the rising stars in the field, were asked what professional opportunities might await them after "The Peony Pavilion," neither professed to have any idea. Both are taking night courses in Chinese cultural administration as a hedge against unemployment, and Mr. Zhang has already made headway as a pop performer, where prospects are better.
Twenty members of their class have already left the company, but the rest are an ebullient lot, as adept at belting out choruses as at tumbling in the battle scenes and even performing acrobatics on stilts. They work under the continuing tutelage of performers twice their age, for a generation was lost to Chinese opera during the Cultural Revolution, when performances were banned. Mr. Chen, now 35, was among the first to emerge after the revolution ended, in 1976. The members of the company are mostly in their 20's or their 50's.
It was in this fragile ecosystem that Ms. Ma took her draconian action to "protect" Kunqu from Mr. Chen's incursions. And what did those incursions finally amount to? Chiefly, attempts to reimagine the spirit of Kunqu when "The Peony Pavilion" was new, before interpretations and costumes took on their present stiffness. Within conventions still highly stylized, he wanted a hint of naturalism.
He also wanted to show the West Chinese folk tradition and, he said, "the best of China." Thus, not only the hundreds of glorious costumes but also a magnificent wooden set, modeled after the famous gardens of Suzhou and the outdoor theater in the museum.
That Mr. Chen was able to achieve all of this on a budget of $500,000 attests to the modest cost of the highest-quality craftsmanship in China and also to his abilities as producer as well as director. With cell phone at the ready, he fairly reveled in detail during those Shanghai rehearsals, fielding crises like the call from the Shanghai Zoo informing him that it would not furnish songbirds for the preview performance for fear that the clangorous Chinese percussion instruments might induce psychological problems; he would instead have to find birds inured to street noise.
This splendid production would have established Mr. Chen as a star. On the basis of the Shanghai preview, Le Monde in Paris has already called it "one of the major cultural events of the end of the 20th century." No matter; Mr. Chen is resourceful enough that he will find his way another time. One can only wish the same for those wonderful performers tossed aside back in Shanghai, one of them, Mr. Zhang, wearing the new suit he bought for New York.

HEADLINE: Claims for Art Collection Pose a Challenge to Hungary

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Martha Nierenberg was one of the lucky ones. When the Nazis invaded her native Hungary on March 19, 1944, "the whole family went into hiding with a friend in Budapest," she recalled. "By noon, they were looking for my father." Unlike others with Jewish backgrounds, she and most of her relatives soon escaped, including her father, Alfonz Weiss. The Weisses were so important economically -- employing 30,000 workers to make everything from airplanes and tanks to tin cans and needles -- that they bartered a 25-year lease on their factory for freedom. When they fled, they were escorted by police cars.
But Mrs. Nierenberg, now 74, also remembers what they left behind -- especially the mansion of her maternal grandfather, Baron Maurice Herzog, on Andrassy Boulevard, Budapest's Champs-Elysees. "It was like a museum, like the Frick," she said. 
 Many of those works, widely known as the Herzog Collection, now hang in Hungarian museums, where they were left for safekeeping during the war or placed after being stolen by the Nazis and later returned to Hungary.
She wants them back.
But Hungary, the latest in a string of countries whose national collections have been hit by individuals' claims for wartime plunder, seems torn. As a fledgling democracy just starting to make its way in the West, and as a country that itself is trying to reclaim looted art in Canada and Russia, including many other paintings from the Herzog Collection, it might be sympathetic. But its national politics and cultural aspirations are tugging in the opposite direction. Negotiations between the Nierenbergs' lawyers and Hungarian officials, which began in mid-1996 and went smoothly at first, broke down last winter, just as Hungary was gearing up for a national election in May.
Mrs. Nierenberg and her husband, Ted, who live in Armonk, N.Y., thought they had an agreement last fall on 21 of the 30 works they had so far claimed, including paintings by or attributed to El Greco, Cranach, Zurbaran and van Dyke. A team of experts from Sotheby's had valued the batch at $8 million to $14.5 million. "We were slightly conservative," said George Wachter, the director of Sotheby's Old Master paintings department, partly because the works were viewed on museum walls and could not be studied closely.
Mr. Wachter called the Cranach and Zurbaran paintings "fantastic pictures," but said that the El Greco was best labeled "workshop of El Greco with the possible assistance of El Greco himself," and that a Velazquez was also probably misattributed. "It is a very beautiful, high-quality picture, and if we did more research, we might be able to go further," he said. "But we said it should be attributed to Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo."
The Nierenbergs were willing to take back 60 percent of this group, and to forgo the rest in lieu of Hungarian taxes. But, they said, Hungarian officials soon reneged, proposing instead to study the case further. The two sides have had no contact for months, and neither agrees with the other's version of what happened.
"They're stalling," Mr. Nierenberg said. "I'm 75, and they think I'll lose interest, and it will go away." (The couple's four children have not focused on the quest.)
The Hungarians, however, differ. "They do have some claims, but we don't know how much," said Ivan Ronai, the director of the department of cultural heritage in the Culture Ministry. "Some paintings were clearly deposited at the museum for safekeeping. Some are less clear. We don't know how they got there." The Nierenbergs have no contracts proving anything, he said.
"The whole collection in Hungary should be handled as a package," he added. "But until we know the exact status of each painting, we are not in a position to bargain. That is why we suggested arbitration. We're waiting for them to come back, but they just refused."
Mr. Nierenberg said he and his wife would agree to international binding arbitration, but not the kind the Hungarians had in mind. "They said, 'We'll go to arbitration, but we pick three Hungarians and you pick three Hungarians,' " he said. "It was utterly ridiculous."
Instead, the Nierenbergs have decided to apply public pressure, despite an early agreement not to talk about the dispute. "The Hungarians said they wanted to get into NATO, and they didn't want any bad publicity," Mr. Nierenberg said. "And then the Government felt it would lose the election if it gave away national treasures."
But with Hungary's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization seemingly assured, and with a new Hungarian Government in place, the Nierenbergs said going public was their best recourse, even though diplomats say the new regime is more nationalistic, less internationally minded than its predecessor.
The designated Minister for Preserving National Cultural Heritage, Jozsef Hamori, just learned of the issue. Donald Blinken, a former United States Ambassador to Hungary who remains interested in the case, raised it with him on a trip to Budapest in late June. Reminding Mr. Hamori that Hungary was the first former East bloc country to allocate funds to pay Holocaust survivors a monthly stipend, "I told him Hungary did it right once and ought to come to grips with this issue of art right away," Mr. Blinken said.
The new Government may also have a hard time taking a tough stance in light of Hungary's activities with Canada. A year ago, the Hungarian Culture Ministry quietly asked the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts to return "The Marriage Feast at Cana," by Giorgio Vasari, which was stolen from the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts during the war. The Montreal museum, which said the painting had been sold in 1961 by a state-owned store in Budapest and acquired later by the museum in good faith, responded that it had no obligation to return the painting. It proposed "co-ownership."
Hungary declined, and a lawyer for the Culture Ministry recently gave letters outlining the dispute to the press. One, to the museum's lawyers, dated Oct. 9, 1997, noted that when war losses were discovered in North American museums, "it has not been the practice to hide behind national laws," but that "a higher moral and ethical standard has systematically been applied."
The Nierenberg case is also complicated by the looted art held by the Russians. They intercepted many paintings stolen by the Nazis in Hungary as the works, including many from the Herzog Collection, were being shipped to Germany.
Over the years, Baron Herzog had donated some paintings to the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, but he retained the bulk of the collection. When he died in 1935, followed by his wife in 1941, the collection was left mainly to his three children, one of whom was Martha Nierenberg's mother, Elizabeth. Elizabeth (who married Alfonz Weiss) later inherited the one-third share of her brother Steven, who died in 1966. The other third was inherited by a brother who died in a labor camp during the war and whose share fell to his Italian ex-wife and their two daughters.
Martha Nierenberg, as the oldest surviving heir of Elizabeth Weiss, said that she; her sister, Mary, and brother, John, were entitled to two-thirds of the Herzog Collection.
For years, no one in the family did anything about reclaiming the art. Much of the Herzog Collection, whose 1,500 to 2,500 pieces included decorative objects as well as paintings by Italian, Spanish and Dutch Old Masters and French Impressionists, has simply vanished. Besides, when the family sought compensation for its industrial losses right after the war, what it got was bunch of virtually worthless Hungarian coupons, Mrs. Nierenberg said.
"This precedent dampened the family's whole desire," Mr. Nierenberg said. "Why do anything for the art? We got bupkis for the real estate and the factory," he added, using a Yiddish term for nothing. The family did not know where the art was because of the Iron Curtain, and Mrs. Nierenberg said her mother downplayed the loss: "Her feeling always was, 'We were out, and it was fine.' "
But a few years ago, the Russians acknowledged that they held "trophy art" from the war in their museums and vaults. When they started to exhibit it, some pictures were even labeled "Herzog Collection." The Pushkin Museum in Moscow, for example, displayed "a big picture of El Greco's that was my mother's," Mrs. Nierenberg said. That changed the Nierenbergs' minds. They set their sights on Hungary because Russia has refused to give anything back.
That decision has not helped their cause with the Hungarians, who have been trying since 1991 to retrieve works from Russia. Minutes of the negotiating meetings with the Nierenbergs' lawyers show that the Hungarian officials have tried several times to shift the conversation to the works in Russia.
"The Hungarians said we should help them get the Herzog Collection back from Russia," Mr. Nierenberg said. "They think it belongs to them. If we get this settled, we might do something with the Russians."
But already, the Nierenbergs said, they have spent more than $50,000 on legal fees and on a curator they hired to prepare an inventory of the art they lost and to substantiate their claims that the paintings were left for safekeeping, not donated. Mr. Nierenberg, who with his wife founded Dansk Design, the upscale housewares maker, in 1954 and sold it in 1985 for about $20 million to Brown-Forman, said he was willing to spend another $100,000 on the claim.
New Government or not, it may not get easier. In recent months, there has been a telling change. Previously, "all these paintings in the museum in Budapest were identified as 'Herzog Collection,' " Mr. Nierenberg said. Now, Mr. Blinken and other witnesses said, those labels simply give the date of acquisition.

Mideast Future Shock

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
The big talk in Israel last week was that three young Israeli software designers, and their venture capitalist backer, just sold their two-year-old company -- Mirabilis -- to America Online for $287 million. Mirabilis is an Internet communications tool that allows users to talk and exchange computer files while on line. Israel is now second only to the U.S. in the number of computer-related start-up companies spawned in the 1990's.
Meanwhile, up north, Syria is still debating whether to allow in the Internet. A Palestinian businessman from Bethlehem who had just returned from trying to do business in Damascus complained to me: "If I go to Syria and I don't have fax, cell phones or Internet, what do I do? These are my tools." 
 Question: What does it mean for the future of the Middle East that Syria is still debating whether to get on the Internet and Israel is already designing the next generation of the Internet?
I think it means a lot. This widening tech gap between Israel and her neighbors -- Israel's G.D.P. is roughly equal to that of Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon and Syria combined -- will simultaneously make Israel much less vulnerable to Arab political pressures, terrorism, boycotts and the ups and downs of the peace process, while making Israel much more vulnerable to conventional or unconventional warfare.
There are several reasons. First, in the old days Israel grew oranges, Morocco grew oranges, Spain grew oranges. So if importing countries were upset with Israel they could easily punish it by buying someone else's oranges. But what happens when there is only one Mirabilis? What happens when an Israeli company near Tiberias is the only one in the world that makes a key Ethernet switching chip? What happens when Israeli companies start to dominate a key tech sector like on-line tools for Internet security, which are built around algorithms developed in the Technion and Israeli Army?
What happens is that everyone comes courting Israel, no matter where the peace process is. Japan, which always shied away from Israel fearing Arab retaliation, is now the second-largest venture capital investor in Israel, after the U.S. Japan is weak in software design and has been gobbling up Israeli software companies. China now has 52 scientists doing research at Israel's renowned Weizmann Institute. India also has 52. "If you have the technology people want," an Israeli business writer told me, "no one cares if you are suppressing Palestinians." In the 1970's the Arabs had what the Japanese needed most to fuel their economy -- oil. Now Israel has a raw material that others covet almost as much -- information technologies.
Another reason Israel is less vulnerable to low-level pressures is that knowledge investors are sophisticated. They understand, unlike tourists, that when a shooting happens in Luxor, Egypt, it is nowhere near their software-design center in Haifa, so they don't run easily. Moreover, high-tech knowledge exports tend to be very light and not easy to disrupt. Some are exported by modem. Also, Israel's high-tech exports go, not to its neighbors, with whom it is in tension, but to faraway markets in Asia, the E.U. and the U.S. Finally, high-tech investment is in people, not factories, which can be easily destroyed.
But it is precisely this last point that underscores Israel's vulnerability as well. Israel is developing a knowledge economy, but knowledge workers are very mobile and they like to live in nice places. If the key knowledge workers in Israel decide that the situation has reached an intolerable point -- because they cannot abide the rising influence of the ultra-Orthodox in political life, or the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians or Prime Minister Netanyahu's mounting attacks on Israeli intellectual elites -- then knowledge people will leave.
Also, while Israel's economy today might be able to absorb more pain without economic costs, there is one thing it cannot absorb, and that is a new war with the Palestinians. With a $17,000 a year per capita income, Israel today has a standard of living close to England's. The Mirabilis kids are the new role models in Israel, where there are now long waiting lists for every engineering school.
If the political situation here deteriorates, and Mr. Netanyahu has to call on Israeli boys to go back and recapture the West Bank and Gaza, the Israeli middle class will be infuriated, and some will be out the door. Israelis will never begrudge Mr. Netanyahu for bargaining hard, but they will not accept a new war of attrition.
There is one more vulnerability -- that Israel will get so far ahead of its neighbors that one of them will, out of humiliation or frustration, lash out in some unconventional manner and try to level the playing field -- and Israel. Those who can't make a bomb will buy a bomb. Those who can't export software will export rage.

HEADLINE: Slower June Growth for Key Part of Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Business activity expanded at nonmanufacturing companies at a slower pace in June than in May, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management.
The index of nonmanufacturing business activity fell to 61.5 in June, from 64 in May. The index was officially begun a month ago by the association, which has been conducting pilot surveys for it since July 1997, when the activity index stood at 57.5. 
 The new survey is a complement to the association's report on manufacturing, which investors use to gauge the direction of factory activity. The new index is a parallel to the production index in the association's manufacturing report and not to the manufacturing report's main composite index.
"Over all in June, nonmanufacturing industries continued to grow and to increase their employment, while reducing inventories and paying less for purchased materials and services," said Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the survey and coordinator of purchasing at the University of Houston-Downtown.
The new-orders index in the survey fell to 59 in June from 63.5 a month earlier. And the index measuring export orders increased to 55 from 48.5. Import orders increased to 56, from 54 in May. Order backlogs fell to 50 from 53.
The manufacturing survey covers about 30 percent of economic activity in the United States, the association said. The nonmanufacturing report was established in an effort to measure the rest by surveying officials in purchasing and supply management at some 370 companies each month.

HEADLINE: India, Eye on China, Insists It Will Develop Nuclear Deterrent

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 6

 BODY:
In talks with the United States on nuclear weapons, which are to resume on Sunday, India will insist on its right to develop a nuclear arsenal capable of giving it a "minimum deterrent" against China, a senior official says.
But in a briefing on Sunday for Western reporters, the official, from the office of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said India would offer concessions, including several the United States has rejected in the past as insufficient. He said India was also willing "eventually" to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, fulfilling a pledge by Prime Minister Vajpayee that India will not conduct more nuclear tests. 
 The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said India already had nuclear weapons it could use in a conflict with Pakistan or China, its likely adversaries.
Whether India is capable of firing nuclear weapons, or needs months or possibly years to turn its technology into useable weapons, has been an open issue since India announced five underground nuclear tests two months ago. Pakistan followed in late May with two rounds of nuclear tests of its own.
"If you're asking me if we have a delivery system, the answer is, Yes, we do," the official said.
India and the United States have already held one round of inconclusive discussions since the nuclear tests, during a visit to Washington last month by Jaswant Singh, a senior official of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist group that leads India's 14-party coalition Government. Mr. Singh is to hold a second round of talks on Sunday in Frankfurt with Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State; Mr. Talbott is to follow up with a visit to New Delhi on July 20.
The briefing officer said India was ready to take steps to respond to Western pressures. The most important, he said, would be its readiness to sign the test-ban treaty once Indian negotiators had determined "what we can get."
By this the official appeared to mean that India would use the prospect of signing the treaty as a bargaining chip in its bid to get the United States to lift or at least ease the wide-ranging economic sanctions Washington imposed after the tests.
In a potentially significant reformulation of earlier statements on the treaty, the official said India would no longer demand that the treaty be rewritten to include language committing all nuclear powers to a schedule for reducing and eventually eliminating their nuclear arsenals. The official said India recognized that with more than 140 nations having signed the treaty, it was impractical to expect it to be rewritten.
Instead, he said, India would press its case for total nuclear disarmament within the so-called Non-Aligned Movement and in the United Nations, forums where India has pressed for the elimination of nuclear weapons for decades.
Before possibly signing the treaty, the official said, India is ready to take other steps: turning India's pledge not to conduct further nuclear tests into what he called "a legally binding international commitment;" making a similarly binding pledge not to transfer nuclear technology to other countries, and pledging to join negotiations in Geneva on a new treaty to limit the production of the fuels required for nuclear weapons.
But the official said India would not accept the main demand by the United States: that India give up development of a nuclear arsenal.
He also rejected another American demand, a halt to missile tests, because India sees the tests as essential to develop a deterrent. All five established nuclear powers -- Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States -- have called on India and Pakistan to halt all steps toward developing nuclear arsenals.
The official said India expected China to be the most resolute in pressing for India not to develop a nuclear arsenal. But he said India was equally determined that it would have an arsenal to balance China's.
"Our problem is not Pakistan," he said. "Our problem is China. We are not seeking parity with China; we don't have the resources, and we don't have the will. What we are seeking is a minimum deterrent."
The official made his remark about being able to deliver nuclear weapons in response to a reporter who noted that India has fighter-bombers that could be adapted to carry nuclear weapons. But the official did not specify whether the delivery system he was referring to involved aircraft or missiles. Western intelligence agencies have estimated that India has a few dozen nuclear warheads, but have expressed doubt that the warheads are ready for use.
Most military experts said India and Pakistan could only use their small stockpiles of nuclear warheads after a time-consuming and technically complex process of mating the warheads to delivery systems, either aircraft or missiles. At the same time, having declared themselves nuclear powers, both countries would almost certainly want their adversaries to believe that the weapons were ready for possible use.
The Government's readiness to talk about concessions on the issue appears to have been hastened by the changing public mood in India, which has gone from euphoria over the tests to anxieties over the sanctions.
The uncertainties have aggravated the slump in the economy that had already begun as a result of the crisis elsewhere in Asia.
India has endured a 20 percent drop in share prices since the nuclear tests, a 7 percent fall in the value of the rupee against the dollar and a flight of foreign investments.

HEADLINE: A Record Pace For Viagra Sales

 BODY:
Viagra, the Pfizer Inc. pill for correcting male impotence, smashed all records in its first three months, according to I.M.S. Health, an industry consultant, which released numbers yesterday.
I.M.S. also predicted that sales of Viagra would reach $1 billion in the United States by March 1999. 
 Prescriptions for Viagra from April through June totaled 2.9 million, enough for estimated sales of $259.5 million, according to I.M.S.
Such huge sales appear easily to be a record. For example, one of the leading drugs introduced last year -- Lipitor, a cholesterol-reducing medicine from Warner-Lambert -- had sales of $12.4 million in its first two months.
Analysts were encouraged that prescription renewals remained strong, despite reports of the deaths of some Viagra users. A Pfizer spokeswoman stressed that the drug was safe when used correctly. Yesterday, the company criticized the Prudential Healthcare unit of Prudential Insurance and Humana Inc. for declining to cover the cost of Viagra because they said they regarded it as unsafe.

HEADLINE: Clinton Agrees to Meet Yeltsin In Russia in Early September

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
President Clinton has agreed to travel to Russia in early September to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin, although the Russian legislature has not fulfilled a request to ratify an important arms control treaty signed with the United States, the White House announced today.
The two Presidents have made a practice of annual summit meetings, but for more than a year the White House had postponed responding to Mr. Yeltsin's invitation to Russia. 
 Mr. Clinton never said that ratification of the treaty, known as Start-2, which was signed five years ago, was a requirement for his visit, but he indicated that it was his strong preference. The President had said he hoped to move on to discussing further arms reductions, a topic that White House officials now say will be on the agenda this fall even without approval of the treaty.
"At the end of the day, they just felt that the issues we have to discuss were more important than waiting for the Duma," said an Administration official, referring to the lower house of the Russian Parliament. In describing those issues, he listed the ethnic violence in Kosovo and the state of the Russian economy, badly shaken by the financial turmoil in Asia.
The Senate approved the arms control treaty in 1996. But despite pleas from Mr. Yeltsin, the Communists and nationalists who dominate the Russian Parliament, citing security concerns and the high cost of destroying the weapons, have dragged their feet over ratification of the treaty, which would cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads apiece. The Parliament plans to take up the issue in September.
The White House said Vice President Al Gore would meet in Moscow later this month with the Russian Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, to help prepare the agenda for the summit meeting. The precise dates for the President's trip, as well the site of his meeting with Mr. Yeltsin, have not been set.
Mr. Clinton is also anxious to visit Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic this year to celebrate the recently approved peace agreement there. He may make those stops as part of his Russia trip, one aide said today.
The White House squeezed the Russia trip into a Presidential schedule already jammed with foreign travel. Mr. Clinton just returned on Saturday from a nine-day trip to China. Earlier this spring, he spent almost two weeks in Africa. In April, he attended a summit meeting in Santiago, Chile, and in May, he attended one in Birmingham, England, making stops in Germany and Switzerland along the way.
The President is still scheduled to visit India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in November, although the White House is weighing a change of schedule because of the nuclear tests conducted this spring by India and Pakistan. Regardless, Mr. Clinton will be in Asia that month, for a summit meeting in Malaysia.
In a meeting with Mr. Yeltsin during the Birmingham summit, Mr. Clinton urged him to seek ratification of the arms control treaty to help persuade budding nuclear powers like India and Pakistan that they were moving in the wrong direction.
Most of Mr. Clinton's travel was scheduled long before the disclosure in January that Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, had broadened his investigation of the Whitewater land deal to include the President's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former intern. But the White House has welcomed the spate of foreign travel as an opportunity to escape Washington and to display the President as a global leader.
The packed foreign schedule is also coming in a year when the Administration is struggling to accomplish its legislative agenda. With Congressional elections looming in November, a comprehensive tobacco agreement has eluded Mr. Clinton, and some Presidential aides have all but given up on a budget agreement.
Today, President Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden to lay out his agenda, pressing Congress to act in what he called "the remaining 38 working days" of this legislative session. He called on Congress to approve new money for the International Monetary Fund, bills to change the campaign finance system and the Internal Revenue Service, and a juvenile crime bill, among other measures.
But the President is trying to avoid a vote on another matter once central to his agenda. The House Speaker, Representative Newt Gingrich, said recently that he may bring up so called fast-track trade legislation this fall to give Mr. Clinton enhanced authority in negotiating trade deals.
Last year, the White House lost a bruising fight for the legislation, as Democrats deserted Mr. Clinton over fears of a backlash by organized labor and environmental groups against trade deals. The White House regards Mr. Gingrich's proposal as a political ploy, and today Mr. Clinton made clear that he was in no hurry to see such a vote.

HEADLINE: Duke Tests Nuclear Agency On Renewing Plant License

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Duke Power, the nation's second-largest operator of nuclear plants, filed an application yesterday to extend the life of its biggest nuclear plant, which has been producing power for 25 years.
No utility has gone through the long, laborious and expensive process of having a license renewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the application by Duke Power, a unit of the Duke Energy Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., is seen as an initiative whose outcome could determine the future of nuclear energy in the United States. Duke's progress in getting the license renewed, which would enable it to operate the three-unit Oconee nuclear power station in western South Carolina another 20 years, will be watched by other utilities that must decide whether to seek renewal or decommission their nuclear plants and build nonnuclear operations to replace them. 
 There are big stakes involved for utilities, consumers and environmental groups.
For many utilities nuclear plants are the cheapest generators of electricity and have become more attractive as the industry deregulates.
Joe F. Colvin, president and chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade and lobbying group, said most nuclear plants could produce electricity at about 1.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than natural gas plants, which average about 3 cents a kilowatt-hour.
"You can beat any competitor coming at you," Mr. Colvin said.
Some utilities have chosen to decommission their aging nuclear plants, which can be very costly. Building new plants is also expensive. Consumers would probably bear most of the cost through higher rates.
For environmentalists, closing older plants would reduce the amount of nuclear waste that must be disposed of. It could also result, however, in building more coal-fired plants, which emit carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.
With so much riding on the outcome, Duke has given itself a great deal of lead time. By filing for a license renewal with the N.R.C. now, it hopes to complete the process in three years, well before its 40-year license to operate the three units of its Oconee Nuclear station expires in 2013.
Oconee, which was built in 1973, is capable of producing 2,538 megawatts of power. It has produced 24 percent of the electricity used by Duke's two million customers in North and South Carolina.
Michael S. Tuckman, the executive vice president for nuclear generation at Duke, said in a telephone conference yesterday that the plant would be a test case for the industry in how the licensing procedure would work and whether the standards set by the commission would be economical to meet.
He said that before filing for its application, Duke had asked other utilities to review and comment on it because they would have to decide whether to seek renewals as well. If Duke encounters difficulty in the renewal process, other utilities might decide not to try a similar effort.
In April, another utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric, filed to renew the license for its Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, which can produce 1,875 megawatts of electricity.
And the largest operator of nuclear plants, Commonwealth Edison of Chicago, a subsidiary of the Unicom Corporation, said yesterday that it would sell its six coal-fired plants, which have a book value of about $1.1 billion, and use the money to improve the performance of its nuclear plants.
The N.R.C. oversees 107 working nuclear plants that produce 22 percent of the nation's electricity.
Duke has prepared for its renewal effort by consulting with the staff of the commission on how to measure the wear and durability of equipment in plants. Mr. Tuckman, however, said the process could extend another three years, through hearings, inspections and tests.
He said the utility had already spent $8 million preparing its filing, which will be delivered to the commission in Washington today. He said the utility expected to spend another $8 million before a decision was reached.
Mr. Tuckman added that the plant had been continually upgraded during its life and that the utility must demonstrate that it could be maintained in good condition another 20 years after its license expires in 2013.
The plant has generally had a solid safety record, but it had some accidents in recent years. A steam line ruptured in 1995 and seven workers were injured, several seriously. In 1990, a line became disconnected from a reactor head and radioactive water leaked but was kept and treated in the containment building.

HEADLINE: Union Pacific Fights Tougher Regulation

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 6

 BODY:
The Union Pacific Railroad, seeking to fend off demands for tougher Federal regulation, said today that congestion was easing, capacity expanding and competition with rival carriers intensifying.
And the company said that the whole railroad was now using a single computer system for the first time since its 1996 merger with Southern Pacific. 
 But many customers are hardly reassured. Executives of the Entergy Corporation, a major electricity provider in the South and Southwest, said the utility had not been able to get enough coal delivered to its power plant in White Bluff, Ark., because of congestion on the railroad's tracks. Several weeks ago, the utility came up with a roundabout solution. Entergy now transfers coal from trains to barges near Chester, Ill., and floats them down the Mississippi River and up the Arkansas River to its plant. But the company says it still cannot satisfy its demand for coal and has asked regulators to allow a rival of Union Pacific to share its tracks.
Critics of Union Pacific have until Wednesday to file complaints with the Surface Transportation Board, the principal railroad regulator. The board will decide whether the Government should do more to clean up railroad congestion around the Houston area and the Gulf of Mexico coast.
Under pressure from members of Congress and Union Pacific customers, the board, which is up for Congressional reauthorization this year, is also set to consider broader forms of relief for the railroad's customers and tighter control over the whole rail industry.
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, a Texas Republican, has introduced a bill that would make it easier for shippers to win rate cases that come before the board in areas that lack competition. The bill would also allow the transportation board to double, to 18 months, the duration of emergency orders such as the one now requiring Union Pacific to share some rail yards and tracks. That order, already extended three times, expires next month.
While the chances that Congress will act before its summer recess are remote, such proposals are often meant to prod the Surface Transportation Board to act on its own.
The merger with Southern Pacific to form the nation's largest railroad caused what regulators called an unprecedented breakdown in rail traffic through the heart of the nation. Economists estimate that shippers have lost billions of dollars, and some customers, like Entergy, have sued for compensation. Union Pacific reached a settlement with DuPont, however, just last week.
Union Pacific says there is no need to continue the emergency order or impose any other rules. "I don't think that by any stretch of the imagination there's a congestion crisis on Union Pacific," said Arvid E. Roach, a partner at the law firm of Covington & Burling, which is responsible for presenting the company's case to the Surface Transportation Board.
Especially in Texas, the epicenter of a Union Pacific crisis that began last year, rail yards have opened up and traffic is flowing more smoothly, the company has said in its weekly reports.
But Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, a leading business group, said that refineries and chemical plants along the Gulf Coast were still having trouble moving their products. Larry Parsons, the United Transportation Union general chairman for much of Texas and Louisiana, confirmed the improvements while adding that conditions were not back to normal. But because the remedy has included a crash hiring program, he said that inadequately trained brakemen and conductors were working on the trains.
"They don't know one end of a boxcar from the other end," he said. "If you're a conductor and they send you one of these newbies out there, you've got to watch this kid to keep him from getting killed when he's running around."
Union Pacific has said that its new employees receive ample training, and Mr. Roach pointed to reduced accident rates this year. Last year, however, a series of crashes left 11 people dead.
The railroad's worst snarls are now in and around Nebraska, where coal trains, grain shipments and cars bound for ports converge on the nation's busiest tracks and its busiest yard, in North Platte. In its latest reports, Union Pacific blames track maintenance and the construction of new tracks and sidings.
Checks with several utilities indicated that Union Pacific's problems do not appear to be a factor in power shortages around the Midwest. Entergy, however, has said it has had to switch from coal to other fuels or buy power from other producers. Union Pacific says it is shipping only about 75 percent of the coal it has committed to carry, but this share represents a gain from about 50 percent in January.
The transition to a single computer system for the entire railroad has contributed to the tie-ups. Computers that could not talk to each other sometimes lost track of shipments altogether. The railroad said it delayed the final stage of its computer integration, on the West Coast, from May 1 to July 1, adding hundreds of technicians to help with the transition.
While many customers have said the merger squelched competition, Union Pacific has said it left two stronger competitors throughout the Western United States. In the merger, it ceded or shared some routes with Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
"Monopolists earn monopoly profits," Mr. Roach added. "This company has had losses for three quarters." The losses have resulted from lost traffic and new investments to expand and improve the rail system.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Worries Over Japan and U.S. Send Treasury Prices Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Concerns about Japan and signs of a slowdown in the United States sent Treasury prices higher yesterday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32, to 107 31/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.57 percent, from 5.60 percent Thursday, matching the low set on June 15 -- the lowest it has been since the Government began regular sales of securities in 1977. 
 Most of yesterday's gains came from overnight weakness in the Japanese yen compared with the dollar, amid speculation that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan was not promising permanent tax cuts. Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla., called yesterday's session extremely quiet with light trading after the long July 4 holiday.
"The bias is toward higher prices," he said, "especially with all the positive information about inflation. The market's positive tone has a lot to do with foreign buying and the strength of dollar.
"Fundamentally the market is strong, and many believe there are more than a half-dozen reasons why the market will continue to do well."
Only about $32.9 billion of bills, notes and bonds were traded by the major brokerage firms by late in the day, down 35.1 percent from the average Monday during the third quarter of 1997, according to Govpx, the bond pricing service.
Yesterday's regular weekly bill auction was uneventful, with the average rate for a new three-month bill 4.960 percent and 5.010 percent for a new six-month bill.
Following are the results of the auction:
 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Black Pioneer Answers the Call;
Detroit Entrepreneur Sees 'Sleeper' Market in Namibia

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: WINDHOEK, Namibia

 BODY:
This windswept capital in the Namibian desert is not the kind of arena where Michael Jackson normally plays. And 500 buttoned-down executives and finance ministers talking tariffs are not his usual audience. But the singer came in May, striding up a conference room aisle in full fedora, lipstick and Sgt. Pepper jacket, with a pushy entourage trailing along, to give a quick speech deploring "the plight of the children of the universe."
It ended: "My new business partner, Don Barden, and I are going to be putting our money where our mouths are. We're going to be looking at global investments that will bring economic development to people and improvement to the lives of children." 
 Getting the Gloved One to declare himself the Global One -- and getting the staid World Economic Forum to make that its kickoff speech here at one of its many regional meetings -- was one of the quirkiest public relations coups southern Africa has ever seen. But the versatile entrepreneur who managed it has some interesting quirks himself.
Donald H. Barden, 54, is one of America's wealthiest black executives. He is the founder of a privately held conglomerate, the Barden Companies, based in Detroit, which had estimated sales last year of $110 million and was No. 14 on Black Enterprise magazine's 1998 list of 100 biggest black-owned industrial/service companies. Mr. Barden is also one of a tiny few who have taken up a challenge thrown down to African-American entrepreneurs by Ronald H. Brown, the late Commerce Secretary: Come back to Africa and build a business.
Some might think Mr. Barden has a fatal attraction for risk. He does not see it that way.
"This market is a real sleeper," he said during a joint interview with Mr. Jackson in a small office in his Windhoek car-rebuilding plant. "Once the free-market system permeates, this continent will be one of the world's most dynamic markets."
Until recently, most of Mr. Barden's risks were confined to the American Midwest. He grew up as one of 13 siblings in Inkster, Mich., outside Detroit. He was captain of his high school basketball and football teams, but had to drop out of Central State University in Ohio in 1963 because he could not afford the tuition. Living with a big brother in Lorain, Ohio, he was a mover and a laborer before opening a record store, then starting a label and venturing into public relations.
That was all before he, by chance, heard that a military recruiting station near his office was looking for new space. Mr. Barden helped it find a spot, and in that switch to real estate he finally began to make some real money.
Mr. Barden later founded The Lorain County Times, a weekly, sat on the Lorain City Council and became a television anchorman, where he realized the profit potential in cable TV. In 1983, after wiring some small Michigan towns, he won the right to wire 375,000 Detroit households in partnership with a Canadian cable company.
Mr. Barden sold his share of the cable TV business for $105 million in 1994. He now owns five Illinois radio stations, an Arizona software company and an Ohio real estate company that has built jails and fancy suburbs. In 1995, he entered the gaming industry; his riverboat, the Majestic Star of Gary, Ind., is America's first black-owned casino.
Mr. Barden doesn't shy from fights. In 1995, he took on Donald J. Trump, publicly accusing him of "extortion" for demanding $25 million as part of a deal to share a wharf site in Gary. Nor is he shy about sometimes using race to his advantage. He did so to win the Detroit cable franchise, and last year he accused the city's mayor of failing blacks and native sons by denying him a casino license.
At first glance, Mr. Barden's entry into Africa seems counterintuitive. He chose Namibia, a country of only 1.7 million people, instead of the obvious place, South Africa, with its higher income and its population of 40 million. On top of that, Mr. Barden is going into businesses he has never been in before: a General Motors dealership and sales of canned food, drinks and mattresses. And his target markets include some of the poorest, most forgotten people in the world: the suffering millions of war-torn Angola and Congo, the former Zaire.
But there is method to his seeming madness. As Mr. Barden is quick to point out, Namibia has excellent roads, railways and phones, a benign if arid climate and a deep-water port at Walvis Bay. It has had eight years of democratic government and a currency linked to the relatively stable South African rand. And, most important, little Namibia really, really wants him.
Mr. Barden's connection with the country began in 1989, when he held a cocktail party at his home for the ambassador of the South West Africa People's Organization, the movement fighting to liberate the country from South African rule. The movement succeeded in 1990, and six years later he invited President Sam Nujoma to Detroit and arranged a tour of a General Motors plant. G.M. was looking for a route back into southern Africa, and Namibia was interested -- but only if it got an assembly plant. The market was too small for G.M. to bother with, but Mr. Barden suggested splitting the difference: if the Namibian Government would buy 800 G.M. vehicles through him, he would build a plant to convert them to right-hand drive.
That appealed perfectly to one of the pet peeves of Mr. Nujoma, a sometimes cranky, sometimes jovial former guerrilla: his resentment of South Africa. White rule is gone, but South African corporations still dominate the regional customs union, and the high tariffs set to protect their Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes and Toyota local assembly plants make cars in the whole subregion very pricey.
Kano Audley Smith, managing director of the Namibian Barden operations, said he could import G.M. cars, pay the duty, convert them and still charge $1,000 to $18,000 less than a comparable model from South Africa. "If they were to price their vehicles realistically, we'd be in trouble," he said.
When a reporter questioned the deal with Mr. Barden at a recent news conference, President Nujoma cut her off, saying testily: "We want American products, not ones from those whites in South Africa. We don't want to give our money back to white colonials. The cars are cheaper, too -- you can go check."
About 125 pickups, police cars and school buses have already been delivered.
Mr. Barden says he has spent about $16 million to put together the Windhoek plant and to train workers. But the car operation is merely a foot in the African door, he says. He and Mr. Jackson envision "investments eventually in the hundreds of millions," and are particularly looking for casinos, resorts and theme parks. South Africa's three major cities are granting casino licenses right now.
"We'll go 50-50 on everything," said Mr. Jackson, who once looked into buying Sun City, the Indiana Jones-style casino resort complex built in South Africa by Sol Kerzner, the South African casino magnate.
Mr. Jackson and Mr. Barden were a little vague on how that would help children, but Mr. Barden recovered, saying, "If you're involved in creating wealth, it puts you in a position to help the world." Because Mr. Jackson is a role model, he added, his focusing on business would encourage children to grow up and do the same, leading to economic empowerment.
And there is no disputing, for all the controversy that has surrounded Mr. Jackson, that he is indeed a role model for children. The crowds that came out to see him even in tiny Namibia were bigger than any crowds here ever before, including at independence.
Mr. Barden said their next investment would be warehouses in a new tax-free zone on the Angolan border. Namibia may be tiny, but there are millions of people in Angola, the former Zaire and western Zambia with little access to goods because central African roads are atrocious.
Asked if he was crazy to seek out these markets -- Zaire had a fierce civil war last year and a low-intensity war in Angola has dragged on for 24 years -- Mr. Barden said: "You think that if they have a civil war, they're going to stop coming across the border to buy goods? They still have to have food, mattresses, stereos, refrigerators and beer, don't they? And they pay in diamonds -- that is, they pay in cash they got from diamonds. In U.S. dollars. That's pretty attractive."
Namibians back him up on that. Most Angolans are poor, but "we're used to seeing Angolans in the oil and diamond business driving into Namibia in big U.S. cars to shop," said Philip H. Namundjebo, an official in Namibia's offshore development agency.
By investing in Africa, Mr. Barden and Mr. Jackson have become a rare breed. Lots of American corporations send black executives to Africa, but few black-owned companies have invested here.
"He's a pioneer," acknowledged Millard W. Arnold, head of the United States Commerce Department's Johannesburg office. "He's been fairly astute in maximizing an opportunity in a country like Namibia."
Only a few other black-owned companies came. Ebony magazine has a South African edition, for example, but is not widely available.
With a 121 percent sales increase in 1997, Carson Holdings, based in Johannesburg, which makes Dark and Lovely and Let's Jam hair products, is doing better in Africa than its parent, Carson Inc., is in the United States. It is run by Malcolm Yesner, a white Zambian, but owned by an investment group headed by Roy Keith, a black American.
Procter Houston, another American, who arrived in 1995 to distribute institutional furniture and says he is doing about $1.5 million in sales a year, said a "second wave" of black entrepreneurs was landing in southern Africa now. He came out of curiosity about the new Government, he said, and found an amenable environment. The newcomers, mostly engineers and computer specialists, began arriving in the last year, partly thanks to Mr. Arnold's efforts, he said.
Some black investors, however, have been badly stung. Pepsi South Africa, for example, which drew in celebrity investors like Whitney Houston, Bill Cosby and Johnnie Cochran, just could not make inroads into Coca-Cola's market dominance, and closed in a year.
Mr. Barden seems unworried.
"We're excited about being here because Africa is our homeland," he said. "But we don't come in doing a lot of talk. This isn't the first time I've built a building, or a new business. We're here to get a job done, and make money."

But Mr. Barden sees Namibia as a tax-free base to deal in goods for war-torn Angola, the former Zaire and western Zambia. (Jim Groblem for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Gay Rights Movement Meets Big Resistance in S. Carolina

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C.

 BODY:
It was not by accident that the first shot of the Civil War was fired in this tradition-bound state, where few things are viewed so seriously as an assault on the inherited culture. It is a place where lawmakers still scoff at suggestions that the Confederate battle flag be removed from the Capitol dome and where only a Federal court order enabled women to enroll at the Citadel.
These days, with increasing vigor, the resistance to change extends to another perceived threat: homosexuality. For more than two years, leaders of this state's churches, governments and schools have erected barrier after barrier against what many view as a cultural invasion that offends cherished values. 
 In an election year when there is little economic discontent, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, brought new focus to the politics of morality when he declared in a television interview in June that homosexuality is a sin. But if Mr. Lott was trying to escalate a rhetorical war on homosexuality, the battle was joined some time ago here in South Carolina.
It began in May 1996, when the Greenville County Council adopted a resolution declaring homosexuality incompatible with community standards. The decision, on a vote of 9 to 3, prompted organizers of the run carrying the Olympic torch to Atlanta to shelter the flame in a van as it moved through the county.
Last year Republican Party leaders in Charleston County pressured the county prosecutor, David P. Schwacke, also a Republican, to disclose that he is gay by publicly accusing him of downloading pornography and soliciting gay sex on his office computer. In June, a grand jury chose not to indict Mr. Schwacke, who is divorced from his wife of 14 years, and he apologized to his constituents for "the mistakes in my personal life."
And this year the Mayor of Myrtle Beach joined business and religious leaders in opposing a gay-pride rally there, a high school principal canceled a free concert by the Indigo Girls, at least partly because parents complained that the rock singers, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, are lesbians, and a Republican candidate for state agriculture commissioner vowed to protect the family farm from the "homosexual movement."
While a recent report by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force asserts that a growing majority of Americans support equality for homosexuals, gay rights leaders acknowledge that South Carolina may be a microcosm of much of non-urban America. The state is inherently conservative in its politics, religion and social practices, and many here regard the increasing openness of gay life as emblematic of a broader moral decay.
"It's not just homosexuality," said the Rev. Steve R. Hubbard, a 37-year-old Baptist minister from Myrtle Beach who organized a family-values coalition in response to this year's gay-pride rally. "We've got a 60 percent divorce rate. We've got kids killing kids in our schools. We've got gambling that is destroying families. And in the end, what is always hurt is the traditional family."
But gay rights leaders, political scientists and government officials also agree that a distinct confluence of factors has contributed to the rawness of gay rights conflicts here: the pervasiveness of fundamentalist Christianity, which interprets scriptural warnings against homosexuality as God-given truth; the ties between religious conservatives and the state's surging Republican Party; the increasing activism of the state's gay community; the South's history of institutionalized bigotry, and the state's resistance to cultural change, racial and otherwise.
"People here perceive themselves on the defensive, defending their culture, their religion, their communities, against outside forces," said Charles W. Dunn, a political scientist at Clemson University.
South Carolina's gay leaders say homosexuals have been energized by the attacks, with more living openly and more taking an active stand on political issues. Gay rights organizations have been established in all the state's major cities. The gay-pride march in Myrtle Beach this year, the ninth annual such event in the state, attracted an estimated total of 5,000 to 8,000 people.
Gay leaders depict their victimization as in keeping with a legacy of Southern hate. While public expressions of racism are no longer acceptable in the region, they say, there is no such taboo against homophobia.
"There may be discrimination against gays and lesbians everywhere, but here the gay-baiting is so open," said Harriet D. Hancock, a mother of three, including a gay son, and co-chairwoman of the South Carolina chapter of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. "It used to be race-baiting. Now it's gay-baiting."
Tony Snell, co-chairman of the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement, which has a mailing list of 8,000 to 10,000, said the state's homosexuals were "the scapegoat du jour."
"They've sent a message here," Mr. Snell said of antigay forces, "that it's O.K. to hate."
But church leaders depict their message as one of hate for the sin and love for the sinner.
Like many in the family-values movement, the Rev. Stan Y. Craig, pastor of Choice Hills Baptist Church in Greenville and an organizer of his city's Citizens for Traditional Family Values, cites the Bible as the foundation of his approach to gay issues. Mr. Craig, a beefy, white-haired Vietnam veteran who buffs his dress shoes to a reflective sheen, said he believed that homosexuality was "demonic" and "a stench in the nostrils of God." His organization's blue and white placards proclaim that homosexuality is "Satan's plot for our children."
Wade C. Cleveland, one of the three members of the Greenville County Council who opposed its resolution against homosexuality, said that homophobia might not be more prevalent in South Carolina than elsewhere but that it was perhaps more virulent, "because we get it so honestly from the Bible."
Mr. Snell and Ms. Hancock argue that fundamentalist zeal has influenced policy and political rhetoric because of Republican politicians' dependence on the votes of religious conservatives. The state Republican Party is certain enough of its constituents' views on homosexuality that it does not even poll on the issue.
"It would be like asking everybody if they're for free ice cream," said Trey Walker, a party spokesman.
Recent elections here have shown that the most socially conservative candidate does not always win Republican primaries. That said, in the last 14 months Gov. David Beasley, Lieut. Gov. Robert Lee Peeler, Attorney General Charlie Condon and United States Representative Bob Inglis, who is running this year to take a Senate seat away from Ernest F. Hollings, have all attended family-values rallies that were organized in response to gay rights marches.
In the Senate race, the Republican state chairman, Henry D. McMaster, has already derided Mr. Hollings's sponsorship of a 1983 bill to protect homosexuals from employment discrimination. At the Republican state convention in May, David C. Eckstrom, who later won the party's nomination for state education superintendent, spent more than a third of his speech promoting his support for the cancellation of the Indigo Girls concert, at Irmo High School, near Columbia.
"The time has come to take a stand," said Mr. Eckstrom, who is chairman of the school board that governs Irmo High. "If the Indigo Girls got their feelings hurt, that's too bad."
Taking the political use of gay issues a step farther, Jim Gordon, a Republican candidate for state agriculture commissioner, declared recently that "we can't have farming based on Bob and Bob being married and a new definition of marriage." Mr. Gordon won 31 percent of the vote in a three-way primary on June 9, finishing second to the incumbent.
Not surprisingly, gay rights leaders find much wanting in South Carolina's legal code. The state is one of 14 that outlaw sodomy, both homosexual and heterosexual, according to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. It is also one of 29 states with laws prohibiting same-sex marriages.
When the Legislature banned same-sex marriages in 1996, Governor Beasley said that "America is in a moral meltdown today because its leaders, under pressure from special-interest groups, want to always appear tolerant."
South Carolina is also one of nine states without a hate-crime law of any kind. After a racial shooting in 1997, Attorney General Condon proposed hate-crime legislation that would have assigned special penalties to those convicted of crimes motivated by racial bigotry. But when lawmakers introduced a competing bill that would have expanded the definition of a hate crime to include bias attacks against women and homosexuals, Mr. Condon dropped his support, saying it would be impossible to gain passage of such legislation.
Some gay leaders say Mr. Condon and other officeholders have contributed to a climate that encourages antigay violence. Twice in the last seven months, they note, a lesbian named Regan Wolf has been brutally whipped at her home near Lancaster, S.C. Both times Ms. Wolf was knocked unconscious and strung up spread-eagled on a porch. In the first incident, a message was left in spray paint on the steps: "Jesus weren't born for you, faggot." State and local law-enforcement officials have made no arrests and decline to say whether they regard the attacks as homophobic.
Many of those leading the fight against gay rights make clear that they feel their state and their values are under siege.
Mr. Craig, the Greenville minister, said he had grown increasingly disturbed as President Clinton liberalized the nation's policy on homosexuals in the military, as television sitcoms began to feature openly gay characters and as gay and lesbian marchers walked through Greenville last year.
"What is about to happen in Greenville has already happened in places like San Francisco and New York City," Mr. Craig said. "We really believe this is the last bastion of moral decency left in America."
The same sentiment led Mark S. McBride, a City Councilman in Myrtle Beach, to speak out last year against the opening of a gay bar in the resort town's gaudy boardwalk area. The bar, he said, would not blend with the family-friendly image that Myrtle Beach has long tried to promote.
His stand against the bar gave Mr. McBride a platform from which to run for mayor, and he narrowly defeated a longtime incumbent in November. In response, the state's gay-pride movement announced that it would hold its May 1998 march in Myrtle Beach. Mr. McBride again made his displeasure known, and the city's largest developer, the Burroughs & Chapin Company, killed plans by several nightclubs in one of its developments to hold an outdoor concert by the Village People on the weekend of the march.
"We were not going to allow our company's facilities to be used to further a cause that we felt was a negative influence on our community," said Douglas P. Wendel, the company's president.
Although the gay bar opened and the march was held (Mr. McBride sent his wife and two children to Greenville for the weekend), the 34-year-old Mayor still hopes to preserve the traditional-family orientation of his town.
"What we've built ourselves on over the last 60 years is the traditional-family base," he said. "People don't come here to be subjugated to all the progressiveness, all the sophistication, all the enlightenment of big-city life."

HEADLINE: Three Mile Island: Cleaned Up, and for Sale

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: LONDONDERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa.

 BODY:
With a name that most people equate with nuclear disaster, Three Mile Island might not seem to be choice real estate.
But GPU Inc., which owns the plant on an island in the Susquehanna River here, is convinced it can do something that no other company in the country has done: sell a used nuclear reactor. 
 "We've been working on its curb appeal," said Jim Langenbach, the site director, sounding a little like a homeowner who just added a new coat of paint before an open house. "Pulling weeds, picking up trash, planting flowers. The real reality has nothing to do with that, but it doesn't hurt."
Almost 20 years have passed since warning sirens blared, schools closed and more than 100,000 residents fled central Pennsylvania, afraid of radiation poisoning from the most serious nuclear power plant accident in the United States.
While the fear has faded, employees here say that when people find out where they work, they are still asked whether they glow in the dark. And a visitors center attracts thousands of people every year to its observation deck to peer across the muddy Susquehanna River at the hourglass-shaped cooling towers.
Yet in the next month, the fortunes of Three Mile Island, whose mistakes shook public confidence in the nuclear power industry, could signal its ability to survive the worst adversity. At a time when many have predicted that nuclear power will not be able to compete in the increasingly deregulated electricity market, a sale of the remaining operating unit on Three Mile Island would show that one company, anyway, thinks atomic energy can turn a profit -- for the right price.
GPU, based in Parsippany, N.J., has had the reactor actively on the block since December. Fred D. Hafer, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in June that he had been negotiating for months with a prospective buyer, which he declined to identify, and expected to announce a deal by the end of July. Up for sale is just Unit 1, which was not involved in the March 1979 accident. Not for sale is the hulk of Unit 2, from which tons of radioactive rubble were removed after a partial meltdown of its core and which will never produce electricity again.
Mr. Hafer also hopes to sell the Oyster Creek nuclear plant in Forked River, N.J., in the same deal.
A dozen people who follow the industry, including analysts and nuclear critics, say that the Peco Energy Company of Philadelphia, which already operates two nuclear plants, both in Pennsylvania, is the most likely buyer. Peco recently established a joint venture with British Energy to acquire nuclear plants.
"We believe that we can build an even greater competitive advantage by grouping nuclear units to exploit economy of scale," said Jim Waddington, a Peco spokesman, who declined to comment on whether the company would buy Three Mile Island. Jerry Rainey, who heads Peco's nuclear division, added, "I think you'll see a deal announced in 1998," though he also refused to identify the plants that would be involved.
To be sure, these are complicated deals, and nothing is certain until a contract is signed, especially price. Unit 1 is reportedly worth $600 million, but several factors must be weighed, including determining responsibility for the ultimate costs of taking the unit out of service. And even if an agreement is reached, it would have to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state officials.
Nonetheless, the plant is buzzing with the possibility of a takeover, officials of nearby towns have been notified that a change may occur, and Mr. Langenbach said he already had transition plans on his desk.
If the sale comes to pass, Mr. Hafer will have succeeded where others have failed.
Over the last few years, a spate of troubled reactors have been put on the market, but there have been no takers. The owners of one plant, Maine Yankee in Wiscasset, even created a Web page (www.buynuclear.com), complete with color photographs, to promote its sale, but to no avail. The plant was retired, though its equipment is still for sale.
GPU was prompted to divest itself of its nuclear operations by a new law in Pennsylvania that ends the guaranteed rate structure that benefited utility monopolies.
It has opted to get out of the business of generating electricity -- from reactors and all other sources -- and instead concentrate on transmission.
As more states adopt deregulation laws, other companies are likely to follow suit. Connecticut, for instance, passed an electric deregulation law earlier this year that requires the state's largest power company, Northeast Utilities, to try to auction off its nuclear reactors by 2004.
Still, analysts say there are likely to be more sellers than buyers, and even some companies that have successfully managed nuclear plants are wary about adding more.
"We are not looking to increase our nuclear exposure," said Randy Wheeless, a spokesman for the Duke Energy Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., which operates seven reactors. "There's a lot of uncertainty about how nuclear will be treated in a deregulated environment. From our standpoint, it may be best to sit and let those questions be answered." Duke, however, hopes to extend the useful life of existing plants well into the next century.
The idea that someone would want to buy Three Mile Island has some local people reeling.
"I had customers who were just sitting here laughing about it," said Alma Zeager, 42, the owner of Village Homestead, a nearby restaurant. "I still don't think it's safe, but I don't want to move to Philly."
But what makes the deal appear promising is that many think that Unit 1 of Three Mile Island is among the best-run reactors in the world. As company executives are at pains to point out, there are, in a sense, two Three Mile Islands, the bad one of 1979 and the good one of today.
Only a football field away from Unit 2, which will never operate again, Unit 1 last year completed a continuous run of 616 days and 23 hours, a world record for uninterrupted operation of a light-water nuclear reactor, the type in commercial use in the United States.
While many of the 107 reactors now operating in the United States are unable to produce electricity as inexpensively as plants powered by gas, coal and oil, Unit 1 is an example of how nuclear power can compete.
GPU has projected that any power company that has operating costs of more than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour in the New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland market will be unable to survive, and Unit 1 comes in at 2.5 cents. That is in stark contrast to Oyster Creek, for instance, which the company estimates has a cost of 3.7 cents a kilowatt-hour.
"This unit has been one of the industry's best performers," said Kit Konolige, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. David A. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said, "It is very competitive."
Plant workers and company executives say that the industry as a whole, and Unit 1 in particular, learned valuable lessons from the accident at Unit 2.
The accident occurred when operators did not close a pressure-relief valve, allowing a million gallons of cooling water to escape and causing the radioactive core to reach 5,000 degrees. If operators had closed the valve and turned on an emergency cooling system, the accident could have been averted.
The plant had been operating only a few months before the accident, and workers did not comprehend what was happening. They mistakenly thought that a light on the control panel meant the pressure-relief valve was shut.
Advocates for nuclear power contend that this mistake would not be made today. They say that the industry now requires more training, that every reactor has an on-site simulator for practice, that the number of control room workers has increased, that management is required to be more actively involved in daily operations and that Federal regulators have stepped up their oversight.
And if Unit 1 is sold, the deal will confirm the belief of many workers that they have overcome the past. "We were a joke in the industry," said Dave McCurdy, a maintenance supervisor for 29 years. "This would show that we've come back."
Already there are people who once fought to close the plant who now support it. "I've got to be fair about it," Mayor Stephen R. Reed of Harrisburg said. "The plant has made some major advances."
Indeed, Unit 1 was closed six years as the plant revamped operations.
But Eric Epstein of Three Mile Island Alert, an anti-nuclear group, said that improvements were overstated. He noted that only last year, the N.R.C. fined GPU $210,000 for a string of violations, including inadequate engineering designs and poor implementation of emergency preparedness programs.
Still, the N.R.C. has an overall favorable impression of Unit 1. "If you get beyond the image that so many members of the public have," said Neil A. Sheehan, an N.R.C. spokesman, "its performance has been pretty successful."
The idea that the reactor could be sold to Peco troubles Mr. Epstein because of that company's past. In 1987, Federal regulators shut down Peco's Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Delta, Pa., because operators were found sleeping in the control room.
Since then, Peco has overhauled its operations, becoming, according to analysts, a leader in the industry. Peach Bottom was restarted in 1989, and this year it and Peco's other nuclear plant, in Limerick, received Power magazine's Powerplant Award, marking them as among the nation's best-managed reactors.
But Mr. Epstein noted that Peco was fined $55,000 in June by the N.R.C. because scraps of netlike nylon cloth, used for maintenance, were discovered in an emergency cooling pump at Peach Bottom that could have hindered its use in an accident.
A sale of Three Mile Island to Peco, Mr. Epstein said, would be like "transferring the title from the Three Stooges to the Marx Brothers." He said the true lesson of Three Mile Island had yet to be learned: no nuclear plant, he contends, can be operated safely.
Visitors at the observation deck gift shop one recent afternoon did not seem troubled by any of this as they considered buying Three Mile Island T-shirts, mugs and other souvenirs.
Bill Hollinger, who works in the visitors center, said he sees lots of tourists from abroad and that Europeans are surprised they can get so close to the accident site. Schoolchildren sometimes even stand at the bottom of the defunct cooling towers and shout upward to create an echo.
The visitors, he said, "can't believe that this is where it happened."

HEADLINE: Do Cyprus Arms Threaten NATO?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire (column, July 2) believes that if Cyprus acquires Russian anti-aircraft missiles, this will destabilize the region and threaten Turkey. The problem is that Cyprus has no air force and is bound to seek some form of air defense system. 
 The solution is for the United States to lift its unofficial arms embargo on Cyprus and sell the Cypriots the Patriot theater defense missile system. The United States would thereby increase its arms exports without the embarrassment of selling to a dictatorship while also depriving the Russians of a sale. The Greek Cypriots would have the air defense they crave. Finally, the Turkish air force would have nothing to fear from the inaccurate Patriots -- given their widely reported ineffectiveness against Iraqi Scuds in the Persian Gulf war.

HEADLINE: Workers at Rally Should Fear for Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your July 2 editorial "Labor's Abuse of the City" chastised the building trades unions for paralyzing Manhattan and roughing up civilians and the police in a June 30 rally. I suggest you look at why so many workers took to the streets. Workers are frustrated and scared because their living standard has been declining since 1973. 
 Even with this booming economy, workers' wages are still lagging. Union construction workers feel especially anxious, because nonunion construction companies, which pay their workers less, are stealing their jobs. Nonunion contractors bid and win projects based on substandard wages and poor working conditions, not management skills.

HEADLINE: Workers at Rally Should Fear for Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Balloon That Refuses to Be Popped" (Business Day, July 1): Standard economic theory predicts that given today's low unemployment and "Asian-flu" economy, the stock market should have taken a hit by now. Contradicting that theory, the market remains near all-time highs. 
 The market remains high because labor lacks political power. After two decades of anti-union assaults worldwide, labor has lost the ability to drive up wages in a low-unemployment economy. And as long as wages are kept in check, stock prices will remain high. Only when labor wins wage increases and prevents job cutbacks will stock prices start to decline. The current strike at General Motors as well as the recent rally of an estimated 40,000 New York construction workers signal that labor is rediscovering its power.
If so, lower stock prices are on the horizon.

U.S. Confident on Funds For Oil for North Korea

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
The United States said today that it had not raised enough money to supply North Korea with oil in return for freezing its nuclear program, but expressed confidence that the money would be found.
The State Department said it was talking to Congress and lobbying other countries for the money to provide North Korea with the 550,000 tons of heavy fuel oil that it was promised every year under an accord in 1994. The pact obligated North Korea to shut old graphite-moderated nuclear reactors that the United States said could produce fuel for nuclear weapons. 
 A new consortium, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, was to have built light-water reactors in North Korea that are less subject to nuclear proliferation, as well as supplying the oil.
A State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the consortium had delivered this year 168,000 tons of oil, with an additional 73,000 to be sent this month. The Administration, Mr. Rubin said, is consulting Congress about extra financing to buy oil and had come up with $5 million on top of $30 million that it had previously agreed to provide.
The European Union, Mr. Rubin said, is expected to contribute $16 million to help the consortium cover its debt for past purchases.

HEADLINE: At Long Last, Candidate for Governor Picks a Running Mate

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 6

 BODY:
Ending a search so prolonged and public that it threatened to become an embarrassment to her Connecticut gubernatorial campaign, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly plans to announce Tuesday that she has chosen a former state legislator as her running mate.
Joseph D. Courtney, 45, a lawyer who retired from the State House of Representatives in 1994, agreed this afternoon to be the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, an aide to Mrs. Kennelly said. They are to make the announcement jointly on Tuesday in Mr. Courtney's hometown of Vernon, east of Hartford, and then greet voters at a diner, the aide said. 
 In an effort to retain an element of surprise about her selection, Mrs. Kennelly confirmed today that she had made her decision but would not say where she would announce it.
Mrs. Kennelly, who is retaining her seat in Congress while she campaigns, has trailed Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican who is seeking a second term, in polls and fund-raising. Her campaign staff had made overtures about the second slot on the ticket to several prominent Connecticut Democrats, and even a few obscure local officials. All took themselves out of the running.
Her problem became such an open secret that last week a political column in The Hartford Courant carried the headline, "Wanted: Running Mate for Kennelly. Send Resumes."
Mr. Courtney, who was elected to the Legislature four times, was House co-chairman of the Human Services Committee and later House co-chairman of the Public Health Committee. He is known for being liberal but practical, and received high marks for deft handling of cuts to state programs for the poor, elderly and disabled during the recession of the early 1990's.
But he brings Mrs. Kennelly's ticket none of the geographic diversity that candidates often seek in a running mate. Vernon is just 13 miles from Hartford, where Mrs. Kennelly is a lifelong resident.
In Connecticut, voters choose a Governor and a Lieutenant Governor as a pair. The current Lieutenant Governor, M. Jodi Rell, will seek re-election with Mr. Rowland.
Party regulars had urged Mrs. Kennelly to pick a running mate from Fairfield County, home of many wealthy Democrats, or the New Haven area, which is heavily populated. She had settled on a well-known Fairfield County resident, Gene F. Eriquez, who is the Mayor of Danbury, but he developed a kidney ailment last month and withdrew his name from consideration. Mrs. Kennelly's supporters were especially disappointed because Mr. Eriquez, an Italian-American, would have brought ethnic diversity to the ticket.
Nevertheless, party officials, who said they insisted on anonymity because they did not want to spoil Tuesday's announcement, said they were enthusiastic about the choice because Mr. Courtney's legislative experience would help the ticket attack Mr. Rowland's administration for its record on education, the environment and public health.

HEADLINE: After Legal Odyssey, Man Faces 2d Trial in Officer's Death

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
Many of his alibi witnesses are dead, crucial evidence has been lost and the police officers who arrested him have long since retired. But after a 22-year legal odyssey that has taken him from courtroom to prison to freedom and back again, Vincent James Landano is to go on trial again today for a murder he has consistently maintained he never committed.
Mr. Landano is charged with shooting a Newark police officer, John Snow, during the robbery of a check-cashing office in Kearny, N.J., in August 1976. As he has since he was arrested shortly after the murder, he insists that he was framed and that he was never anywhere near the scene of the crime. 
 Convicted of murder in 1977, Mr. Landano served nearly 13 years of a life sentence before he was ordered released by a Federal judge who ruled that the prosecution had suppressed evidence that might have persuaded the jury to acquit him.
Now a graying 58-year-old with a wife, Camille; a little dog named Sparky; a new house in Manville, and a steady job as a paralegal, Mr. Landano said he expected to be vindicated and regain control over his life. "I've been fighting for 22 years -- half of my life -- and I'll be damned if they are going to beat me," he vowed. "I'm not going into it to lose."
Since Mr. Landano was freed in 1989, a series of Hudson County prosecutors have continued to pursue him, maintaining in court hearing after court hearing that there was convincing eyewitness and physical evidence of his guilt.
The "interests of justice and fair play will be best served" by presenting the evidence again to a grand jury, Donald Gardner, an assistant county prosecutor, said in early 1996. Later that year, a grand jury indicted Mr. Landano once again.
The case will be heard by Judge Shirley A. Tolentino of Superior Court in Jersey City, in a small windowed courtroom where for the last month lawyers have toiled to find jurors with no knowledge of the case. Only last week, they assembled a jury pool of 48 people, who will be winnowed down today just before opening statements.
The Landano case has outlasted all the original judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers and gained a notoriety, not only for its staying power but also for the hostility that has developed among the players.
At various times, Mr. Landano's lawyers have accused the prosecution of coaching witnesses and planting evidence. Prosecutors have demanded that judges order the defense not to discuss the case, and once elicited sympathy from a judge who scolded the defense for trying to "demonize" the Hudson County Prosecutor's office.
And Mr. Landano, who since his release has worn an electronic device that permits the authorities to monitor his movements, is as openly bitter about his experience as he is steadfast about his innocence.
"I have been done the wrong," he said. "I haven't done the wrong."
Mr. Gardner, the prosecutor, was not available for comment yesterday.
Mr. Landano was an unemployed construction worker trying to kick a drug habit when he was arrested in connection with the death of Officer Snow, a 23-year veteran of the Newark Police Department who was shot at close range outside the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service in Kearny.
The officer, in uniform and in a marked patrol car but off duty, was apparently making a scheduled delivery of $46,000 to the owner of the business. He drove up just as two men were robbing the office. One of the robbers ran up to the cruiser, shot Officer Snow through the neck, jumped into a stolen car and fled with his accomplices.
From the first, Mr. Landano maintained that he was never at the scene and that he was being framed by members of a Staten Island motorcycle gang that called itself the Breed. Mr. Landano said he did know one of the gang leaders, a childhood friend named Victor Forni who was later convicted of helping to plan the robbery. But he said he never knew other gang members, although one of them named Mr. Landano as his accomplice in the robbery and the gunman in the Snow shooting.
In the years that followed the first trial, the case took on a new life with enough twists and turns to qualify for a made-for-television script.
Mr. Landano met a West Orange, N.J., lawyer who was visiting another client in prison. The lawyer, Neil Mullin, was intrigued by his story and took Mr. Landano on as a client -- and a personal crusade -- for free. "It was my life's work," Mr. Mullin said recently.
Together with Mr. Landano's wife, who met him when she attended a prison basketball game staged to benefit a charity she supported, Mr. Mullin searched for holes in the case. Eventually, he found enough to convince Judge H. Lee Sarokin of United States District Court that crucial evidence had been suppressed by the prosecution, including evidence that cast doubt on the credibility of some state witnesses and showed that some had expressed doubts about their identification of Mr. Landano.
Then the name of Mr. Forni, the gang leader, reappeared.
In 1996, after Mr. Landano had already been indicted for the second time, documents were made available to the defense from a drug case in Florida. They included a statement from an undercover sheriff's detective who said Mr. Forni had bragged to him in 1988 that he had "killed the cop in New Jersey."
But prosecutors have said they do not believe that Mr. Forni was the gunman, and Mr. Forni, who served eight months in prison for his role in the robbery, is listed as a potential state witness in the new trial, as are two of his former gang cohorts.
But many of the witnesses from the first trial will be heard by the jury only through their 22-year-old words, if at all.
Some are dead, including three people who had testified that Mr. Landano was with them at the time of the robbery and murder in Kearny. So is the owner of the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service, who was present during the robbery. One witness, who recounted the motorcycle gang's past robberies, was found hanged in his prison cell in what the authorities said appeared to be a homicide. Physical evidence is missing, as are some tape recordings that could have been of use to the defense.
Paul Casteleiro, Mr. Landano's trial lawyer, said he could not talk about specific trial strategy. But he said the passage of time presented challenges to both sides, as even the memories of living witnesses are hazier than before and the trail of the crime has grown colder.
Both sides have looked to forensic tools that were unavailable at the first trial, including DNA testing and high-tech computer enhancements of photographs, but have not made any major breakthroughs.
Mr. Landano said he pinned much of his hope for acquittal on the possibility that the jurors would hear what he has gone through for the last 22 years. Judge Tolentino has said either side may bring up in open court the facts that Mr. Landano has been convicted and that the conviction has been overturned. "Time did not stand still after 1976," she said last month in court.
Mr. Landano said he wants little more than to make that clear.
"This case is about the truth -- to put to rest who didn't kill Officer John Snow," he said last week. Then he added, "Hopefully who I am and what has been done to me will all become facts presented to the jury."

Now You Can Ride Forever; Is That Good?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
YOU could call Gene Russianoff a metroholic. To get an idea of what a subway addict he is, consider how he ushered in Independence Day.
Some people can be found in bars or clubs at midnight. But as the third of July melted into the Fourth, Mr. Russianoff was standing at the Union Street Station in Brooklyn with $63 in hand to buy the new monthly subway pass that went on sale that very minute. 
 Not that he was going anywhere, except straight back home on foot. But as a leader of the advocacy group known as the Straphangers Campaign, he wanted to be in the delivery room, as it were, for the birth of the new system of unlimited-ride passes that is being trumpeted as a millennial change.
Mr. Russianoff even pondered hurling confetti at the token clerk, but thought better of it. Just as well. You never know these days if a festive gesture will become a quality-of-life offense.
His desire to celebrate was understandable, though. Passes of this type have long been the Straphangers' Holy Grail, and now they are in hand. So is a big test of whether they will bring about the miracles some are predicting. Mr. Russianoff acknowledged the point yesterday as he rode the No. 6 line from station to station to see how the cards sold during the first morning rush they were in effect.
"We're getting what we want," he said, "and now we'll find out if it makes a difference."
Gov. George E. Pataki proclaimed the other day that the fare discounts would empower the rider. That had a nice ring to it, and will no doubt provide the Governor with a campaign sound bite.
But you might want to remember that it was the same Mr. Pataki who depowered the rider a few years ago when he cut state subsidies for New York mass transit by tens of millions of dollars. He took away so much money, in fact, that he brought about the largest increase ever in the subway and bus fare, an increase that proved to be unnecessary and is effectively being scaled back now.
The Governor's political interests aside, some have described the new monthly and weekly passes as innovations that will alter urban life. That seems a bit much.
Sure, being able to take as many trains and buses as you want is exciting. But life-altering? It is a phrase better saved for truly cosmic change in the subways, like whatever it takes to persuade the jughead standing above you that it is boorish of him to munch on pizza as the train lurches through the tunnel. That would require a real miracle.
The goals of the new passes are less lofty, and some lend themselves to easy measurement.
Will subway and bus ridership increase? That seems to be a given.
Will subway and bus service improve enough to handle the extra load? That cannot be taken for granted. The masters of the underground have not done nearly enough to handle the extra 400,000 riders a day produced by the 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 discount that went into effect a year ago. So it is not unreasonable to ask how bad the crowding has to get before they add more cars. Arms and legs sticking out the doors as trains leave the station?
ANOTHER obvious test is whether the new passes will lure motorists out of their cars and onto mass transit. The Straphangers Campaign and Mr. Pataki predict that will happen. But the discounts of the last year have yet to do much good in this regard.
While there are more subway riders, there are also more motor vehicles than ever entering Manhattan, nearly one million a day during the week. That no doubt is because these are good times, and many more people are driving to work. Three cheers for the economy! But the city center is choking on traffic, and political leaders have done precious little to discourage people from driving into town.
Mr. Russianoff argued that lowering the mass-transit fare is only part of the solution. Better subway service is also needed, he said, and stern anti-car measures like tolls on the East River bridges. Those kinds of steps are not necessarily out of the question some day, he added.
"It's a Pollyana-ish thought," he said, "but if these passes can happen, maybe other changes can happen."
Maybe. But let us, like Scarlett O'Hara, think about that tomorrow, and deal with a more immediate anxiety. Have you thought at all about how to keep your monthly pass safe? Lose it, and it's goodbye $63. That's real money.

HEADLINE: Gloom in German East May End Kohl's Streak

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: DRESDEN, Germany

 BODY:
Fritz Hahle is one of those bluff party bosses who burnish the silver lining however gloomy the cloud that hovers over their eastern German fiefs. Three months from a pivotal national election, Mr. Hahle is finding it hard to be optimistic.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr. Hahle's ultimate boss, is fighting an uphill battle for a precedent-setting fifth term. With eastern unemployment stubbornly high -- twice as high as in western Germany -- and a nationwide malaise settling in, the German leader and his Christian Democratic party face a cruel twist of fate. 
 German unity eight years ago was the biggest single triumph of Mr. Kohl's 16 years in office, but now its tribulations could help unseat him by depriving his coalition of a majority in Parliament. That would fundamentally redraw Germany's political landscape, and Europe's too, just as the continent confronts the upheavals of globalization and its own striving for economic unity.
"As things stand, there's not much of a chance," Mr. Hahle said in the smoked-glass-and-steel state legislature building bolted to the old Communist Party headquarters here. "People still regard Helmut Kohl as the Chancellor of unity. But many people are also saying 16 years is enough. That is what is making it difficult for us."
The view finds its echoes on the streets, in the cafes and most of all in the unemployment lines. "The people want hope and Helmut Kohl can't deliver that," said Thomas von Danckelmann, an unemployed Dresden heating engineer who plans to vote for the opposition Social Democrats.
The troubles in eastern Germany are particularly significant because the politically volatile eastern states yield the swing voters that can make or break the narrow margins of success.
The Sept. 27 election will be the third since unification and arguably the most important since World War II. It will determine how the economic powerhouse of Europe defines its future and how it exerts its mighty influence -- with or without a player whose record-breaking stint in office has made Mr. Kohl an immutable center of gravity.
But it will be fought in eastern Germany on one basic question: is the glass half full or half empty? Is reunification a work in progress that will ultimately produce the "blossoming landscapes" that Mr. Kohl promised, or has this remarkable experiment in fusing two Germanys failed?
Four years ago Mr. Hahle delivered a stunning victory here for Mr. Kohl and his party: of Germany's 16 states, his -- Saxony -- scored the single biggest success for the Christian Democrats, even delivering extra seats in Parliament that bolstered Mr. Kohl's narrow majority.
This time, though, the calculations are different.
"In this election every single vote will count, and the Christian Democrats' credibility is under the microscope," said Werner Patzelt, a professor of political science at Dresden Technical University. "If they can't convince people they have done something, then the election campaign will collapse."
Saxony is eastern Germany's richest, most populous state. It is run as a Christian Democratic redoubt by a Governor -- Kurt Biedenkopf -- whose popularity and seigniorial manner have encouraged the nickname King Kurt, and who endures as the party's political heavy artillery.
Its twin big cities, Leipzig and Dresden, have come to symbolize a blend of entrepreneurial spirit, scientific know-how and historic elegance. Tourists flock to the baroque splendors of the opera and the art galleries. The tower of the Frauenkirche in Dresden, destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II, is being rebuilt below a sheath of protective plastic.
Of the hundreds of billions of western German aid dollars poured into the east, often to the advantage of western investors, Saxony has received a substantial chunk.
"Look at the Elbe," exulted Steffen Heitmann, the state Justice Minister. "It was black. It stank. Now there are fish in it. O.K., you can't eat them or swim in it. But look at it."
He gestured toward the river's evening-golden flow where old, refurbished paddle steamers ferry visitors.
"People now speak ironically of the blossoming landscapes," Mr. Heitmann said in an interview, "but they are here -- health care, hospitals, courts, schools. We must show that."
For all that, Saxony labors under the same political blight as follows Mr. Kohl across the land, driving his standing in opinion polls below that of his Social Democratic challenger, Gerhard Schroder, and requiring him to recreate his fabled comeback of 1994.
With Mr. Kohl cemented in history as the titan of German unification, no one doubts his landmark achievement. But like John Major in Britain or George Bush in the United States, Mr. Kohl is depicted, even among his supposed allies, as the tired tail end of a long dynasty that has run its course.
 
Did Helmut Kohl Just Stay Too Long?
Contrast that with eight years ago.
Then, Mr. Kohl's party was seen as the greatest hope particularly among the lower-paid in eastern Germany, and that sense endured for some through the 1994 elections.
Lutz Fischer of Dresden, for instance, was a driver for a Government-owned company in East Germany. Now he runs two vans delivering ice cream on a contract from a big ice-cream company. In 1990, he said, he voted for the Christian Democrats, "because they made the most promises."
Even in the 1994 elections, he said, "four years seemed a short time and you couldn't expect them to do everything."
"But the problem is that nothing has changed," he said. So this time he said he did not plan to vote for Mr. Kohl, though like many eastern Germans he was not quite sure whom he would support.
Even some of Mr. Kohl's stalwart western German supporters are hesitating. "This election is a real dilemma for us," said Josi Kramer, a prosperous housewife in Bonn. "Kohl has been there too long. But who else is there for people like us?"
Younger people, too, sense a disenchantment in many parts of eastern Germany. In one recent local vote in Saxony-Anhalt, an eastern state bordering Saxony, many swerved to the extreme right. Some are heading left.
"At first I thought Helmut Kohl was right to insist on this rapid reunification, this rapid change," said Christian Bernius, 27, a law clerk who plans to vote Social Democratic. "In fact, there was a rapid change on paper, but not in people's heads. Division is going on longer."
Indeed, despite Germany's nominal unity, the election campaign is being fought as two.
In the west, where the bulk of Germany's voters show stable voting patterns, Christian Democratic strategists are waging a "red scare" campaign, accusing Mr. Schroder of working hand in glove with closet Communists in the east.
But in the east, where the challenge is to convince voters that they never had it so good under Communism, the aim is to win back those who believe that reunification -- personified in Mr. Kohl -- has made them second-class citizens.
"The Christian Democrats have written off the east," said Raimund Grafe, a strategist for the Social Democrats. And, said Joachim Herz, the former director of the Dresden State Opera, "what do you expect to achieve by constantly telling 15 million people that everything they did was wrong?"
 
In the East, Little Party Loyalty
The strategy, though, reflects a demographic and political reality: Germany's national elections are fought for the hearts and souls of the big, rich states of the west, where the population is four times that of the east and where voters chafe increasingly at financing the east.
But here in the east, voters are far less entrenched in their party preferences. While 80 percent of western voters display a stubborn party loyalty, Government statistics show, only about half of the easterners show the same fidelity. And they are far more likely to follow their pocketbooks than any sense of political obligation.
Earlier this year, in mayoral votes in two Saxon cities -- Leipzig and Gorlitz -- the Christian Democrats were trounced. In April, in Saxony-Anhalt, Mr. Kohl's party suffered its worst postwar defeat in a state legislative election that produced a sizable showing of 13 percent for the far-right German People's Union. One-fifth of the vote, moreover, went to the former Communists.
Since then, the Christian Democrats in Bonn have taken to castigating the easterners' seeming proclivity for voting for extremes, and for displaying little of the gratitude that westerners expect in return for paying a hated 7.5 percent income tax surcharge to finance the eastern revival.
The ultimate issue in eastern Germany, though, is jobs. At unification, the Communist command economy was rudely dismantled, the West German mark became the currency and an entire way of state-sponsored living collapsed.
But the paradox here is that the vaunted western investment in modern and highly automated industries in eastern Germany has provided none of the guaranteed lifetime jobs of Communism. "The more we modernize, the less jobs there are," Mr. Hahle said glumly.
In the eastern state of Thuringia, for instance, a General Motors plant producing Opel cars is a triumph of reunification that was a stop on President Clinton's tour in May.
The subtext, though, is that the plant, now employing about 2,000 people, replaced an old East German plant that provided five times as many jobs and produced half as many cars.
That pattern is repeated across the east, and the most troubling aspect is that it has produced an entire subclass of 50-somethings who may never work again. Roughly a fifth of the eastern work force is out of a job, twice the western figure. Overall, German unemployment has been stuck at postwar record highs for months.
 
Outbreak of Nostalgia For Cozy Communism
Indeed, what was taken for granted in the old Communist east -- the broad social network, free child care, artificial full employment -- is now glimpsed through the rose tint of loss, paradoxically outweighing gains like freedom and hard currency.
"Apparently it gives no one in Bonn pause for thought that eight years later, there is a nostalgia for the old east, which no one would have thought possible or imaginable in the days of the German Democratic Republic, when we constantly cursed our fate," said Mr. Herz, the former director of the Dresden State Opera.
Come September, said Mr. Heitmann, the Saxon Justice Minister, "it will be a lot" if the Christian Democrats are able to hang on to the seats that proved so valuable to Mr. Kohl in 1994.
"It could still be that the east will tip the scales again," he said, though he did not say in which direction.

Graph/Map: "AT ISSUE: The Shifting Vote"
Germany will go to the polls to elect a Chancellor this September, and while there are still strong loyalties to Helmut Kohl in the west, growing dissatisfaction with reunification in the east is diminishing Kohl's popularity and the chances for a fifth term.

HEADLINE: If These Stones Could Talk . . . A Polynesian Mystery Tale;
Easter Island Giving Up Its Secrets, But Only Grudgingly

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: EASTER ISLAND, Chile

 BODY:
ON the sacred slopes of Rano Raraku, a Polynesian Mount Olympus, the impassive faces on huge statues carved out of soft volcanic stone look across fields tinted dusty pink by the ripening tall grass and far out to the blue waters of the Pacific Ocean. The vista encompasses the entire world that could have been known to the creators of the enigmatic statues, the most distinctive expressions of an ancient society coping with life in isolation on the most remote inhabited island on Earth.
Down on Easter Island's south coast, also in view of Rano Raraku, 15 more of these gray monoliths, called moais (pronounced MOY-eyes), have been reassembled and restored to their original upright positions in a single row on a stone platform. Archeologists consider the site, Tongariki, one of the greatest religious monuments of early Polynesian culture in the South Pacific. It is certainly the most impressive accomplishment of recent restorations here. 
 Everywhere one looks on this speck of land no more than 64 square miles in size, about three times the size of Manhattan, another moai stands silhouetted against the sky or lies in pasture grass or remains in its quarry, incomplete or too large to have been moved by its over-reaching builders. A comprehensive survey by archeologists from Chile and the United States has counted nearly 900 of these statues, with a few more pockets of land still unmapped.
The statues have long haunted the imaginations of explorers, anthropologists and other visitors. Whatever the sculptors intended, the moais are seen as the lithic embodiment of obsession and mystery. In a time more attuned to ecology, they have also been invoked, rightly or wrongly, as a metaphor for the fate of a society that self-destructs through the heedless use of its limited resources.
Early this century, the English ethnographer Katherine Routledge spent more than a year studying the Easter Island culture and its remarkable sculpture. "The shadows of the departed builders still possess the land," she wrote. "The whole air vibrates with a vast purpose and energy which has been and is no more."
On average, each statue stands 14 feet and weighs 14 tons, though one measures 32 feet and 89 tons. The motif is unvarying: an elongated head with long ears, a prominent nose and pursed lips and a shortened torso with hands placed across the abdomen, fingertips just meeting. Coral eyeballs have been restored to only a few of the heads. The vacant eye sockets seem to render all the others blind to the present and unrevealing of the vision that drove the islanders to a frenzy of statue building between 1,000 and 400 years ago.
Archeologists at last are making progress in recovering the history of Rapa Nui, which is the local culture's name for the island, the people themselves and their indigenous language. They also are gaining a better understanding of the motivations, practices and economic foundations of the statue builders. But the place is in danger of losing its alluring air of mystery.
"All outsiders think the island is so simple and straightforward," said Dr. Jo Anne Van Tilburg, an archeologist at the University of California at Los Angeles and writer of "Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology, and Culture" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994). "The remains are so visible there on the surface, and the place is so small. But I've been working there 15 years and I have more questions now than answers."
One evening after a day among the ruins, Dr. Jose Miguel Ramirez, an archeologist and head of the National Park of Rapa Nui, ticked off some of the most intractable mysteries. "We're not sure when the island was first settled, where exactly the people came from or whether they maintained any contacts with their homelands after they arrived," he said.
But scholars have disproved some of the more fanciful conjecture. "This is not the tip a sunken continent like Atlantis, and has nothing to do with aliens from outer space," Dr. Ramirez said emphatically. "We know it was human beings who came here and erected these statues."
Likewise, scholars say they have laid to rest the notion, made popular in the 1950's by the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl, that the original people were Indians from South America. He thought he saw similarities between Pre-Columbian Peruvian and Easter Island architecture. To make his point that such contact was possible, he sailed westward from Peru in a reed raft named the Kon-Tiki.
Linguistic, cultural and genetic evidence, most anthropologists agree, shows that the people of Rapa Nui were Polynesians. Their language is Polynesian, though it has changed so radically as to indicate an early separation from the home culture and centuries of isolation. The few surviving examples of ancient writing are in a script that has yet to be deciphered. The statues and other artifacts bear a Polynesian imprint, and in 1994, the DNA from 12 Easter Island skeletons was found to be Polynesian.
 
The Settlers
Polynesians Found Isle Next to Nowhere
The first settlers apparently arrived from the west by canoe sometime between A.D. 400 and 750. This was a time of epic voyages of Pacific settlement. The migrating Polynesians, originally from Southeast Asia, had reached Tahiti and the Marquesas islands by 300 before going on to discover and occupy Hawaii and New Zealand.
Finding Easter Island, though, must have put the Polynesian navigators to their severest test. They would have had to paddle against prevailing winds and currents, traveling far to the south and east of their usual routes and then somehow coming to an island that is next to nowhere: 1,400 miles southeast of Pitcairn Island, the nearest inhabited land, and 2,340 miles west of Chile, Easter Island's proprietor since 1888.
"It's unlikely this could have happened entirely by accident," said Dr. Ben Finney, an anthropology professor at the University of Hawaii who specializes in Polynesian exploration.
Next year, a team of Hawaiians skilled in traditional Pacific island navigation plan an attempt to duplicate the voyage in a replica of a 62-foot-long, twin-hulled Polynesian canoe. In previous expeditions, the same team established that early sea-going Polynesians had the boats and navigational skills for purposeful exploration and widespread settlement of the Pacific.
Dr. Finney, an adviser to the group, known as the Polynesian Voyaging Society, said the expedition would start from Mangareva, an atoll northwest of Pitcairn. Mangareva is considered one of the more likely departure points for the original voyage of discovery; the Marquesas are another candidate. If the winds are favorable, Dr. Finney said, the journey might be completed in 17 days, but it would probably take much longer to wait for favorable breaks in the prevailing winds.
 
The Reasons
Feats of Bravery, Then Stranded Alone
The Polynesians probably sought out Easter Island for the same reasons they crossed much of the rest of the Pacific, Dr. Finney said. It was not necessarily overcrowding that drove them forth.
"The voyages may have been celebrations of technology," the anthropologist said. "The people had developed the world's best ocean-going technology for the tropics. They were proud of it and wanted to test it to the fullest. And then there was their hierarchical social structure. Only the oldest sons could hope to become chiefs. So like the younger sons of Europe who went off on the Crusades or to the New World, the younger sons of Polynesia organized expeditions to find a new island, where guess who would then become chief."
Once they reached Easter Island, however, the people probably found themselves stranded. Scholars can find no evidence of two-way communication between the island and the rest of Polynesia. The settlers, it seems, were stripping the island of trees, especially the hardwoods used in canoe buildings. Without canoes, they had no way back, and were utterly alone until Jacob Roggeveen, a Dutch mariner, reached the island on Easter Sunday in 1722.
By then, the culture's glory days had passed. Recent excavations led by University of Chile archeologists have uncovered old agricultural fields, seeds and roots of former woodlands, house foundations, ceremonial sites as well as the fallen statues. An analysis of the findings indicates that the island population grew steadily from 1000 to the 1500's, when it apparently peaked at 9,000.
Although the first statues were probably erected soon after the island's settlement, archeologists have found that the people went on a building spree between 1400 and 1600. Nearly all of the statues were quarried and carved at the summit of Rano Raraku, a satellite cone of one of the three volcanoes that formed the island. Toward the end, the sculptors were producing bigger and bigger statues, as if they were desperately appealing for greater divine intercession in times of mounting trouble.
Most archeologists view the statues as the central manifestations of ancestral worship. The island was ruled by a religious aristocracy with the power to enlist a large labor force to create the statues as representations of their forebears, the chiefs who were also gods in Polynesian culture. Nearly all the statues faced not to the sea, but inland, toward fields requiring the blessing of fertility and some of the sacred places.
Dr. Van Tilburg explained that the moai is an icon exemplifying the fundamental Polynesian concern with genealogy, generation, status and respect. It served as "a cultural motivator and modifier of group behavior."
In her book, the U.C.L.A. archeologist wrote, "The originators of moai design were absolute masters of the components of traditional art as communication and use of line to convey emotion, and understood the social function of the form they had created."
 
The Decline
Statue Cult Prey To Man and Nature
By the 17th century, the old order of statue builders was disintegrating. Tribes organized into warring confederacies. Rebelling against the religious elite, they toppled and often decapitated the symbols of their influence, the statues. Famine may have led to some cannibalism.
With the waning of the moai cult, the people replaced it with a "birdman" cult. A warrior from each tribe would meet at the ceremonial site of Orongo on a cliff overlooking tiny offshore islands. The young warriors would race out to the outermost island to bring back the first egg of the nesting season from the sooty terns. The winner, according to a tradition that existed into the last century, became the birdman and the island's ruler for the next year, an incarnation of Makemake, the culture's creator god who was born in the sea.
The collapse of the culture is usually attributed to a combination of overpopulation, overuse of the land and the cutting of all trees for firewood and log rollers for moving the statues. Dr. William S. Ayres, an archeologist at the University of Oregon who has studied the island agriculture, has found evidence that many of the large fields were abandoned in the 1600's and the people increasingly had to subsist on the produce of small household gardens. Their numbers diminished.
As an example of the struggle to live on an island denuded of vegetation, Dr. Ayres said, one of his graduate students, Joan Wozniak, looked under the rocky landscape and detected evidence that the people had resorted to a kind of lithic mulch gardening. They used rocks as mulch to keep moisture in the soil. Under the rocks, she found a thoroughly mixed soil typical of intensive gardening and traces of rotted tubers, even part of an ancient hoe.
Both Dr. Ayres and Dr. Van Tilburg think that the people may not have been entirely to blame for the culture's sad decline. Storms and cyclical climate changes could have had a hand.
"There's a strong possibility that an isolated island like that could have been at the mercy of nature, with no help in reach," Dr. Van Tilburg said. "It's one of the biggest mysteries of the island, and we haven't begun to investigate it."
Restoration of the island's monuments was begun in the 1960's primarily by Dr. Ayres and Dr. William Mulloy of the University of Wyoming, who had been a member of the Heyerdahl expedition. Several of the toppled statues were put back on their stone platforms, called ahu, and the stone dwellings were reconstructed at Orongo.
In the most ambitious project, Dr. Claudio Cristino, a Chilean archeologist, directed the restoration of the 15 imposing moais at Tongariki, completed in 1994. A Japanese company provided a crane for lifting the heavy stones into place.

The Present
Trying to Preserve, And Save, a Culture
While some restorations continue, much of the concern has now shifted to preservation of the monuments and the culture itself. The island has revived from the Peruvian slave raids and disease in the late 19th century that almost wiped out the culture, leaving only 111 people in 1877. "We were almost extinct," Dr. Ramirez said.
The people face a new threat because of the island's new-found prominence. The signs of increasing tourism abound in Hanga Roa, the only town, inviting visitors into auto-rental agencies, small hotels, curio shops, a pizza parlor and a disco. Few children are learning the Rapa Nui language, threatening it with extinction in a generation or two.
Frustrated by the changes, many of the island's 2,000 people are demanding that Chile grant them more control of their affairs, the land and the archeological sites. Their demands for autonomy are boldly displayed on a large sign outside the Roman Catholic church here. Inside, the celebration of Mass reflects merging cultures. The service follows the familiar Christian ritual, but the guitars, drums and lilting voices in song echo the sounds of Polynesia. At the altar, the statue of a saint is carved in the traditional elongated style of the moai.
"We are trying not only to preserve but to rescue the Rapa Nui culture," Dr. Ramirez said.
He is especially concerned for the moais. They and the entire island have been declared a world heritage site by Unesco. The most prominent statues are in the national park, which encompasses 40 percent of the land. Still, they are endangered.
"Our most immediate problem is to conserve these statues from people and cattle," Dr. Ramirez said, referring to increased tourist traffic and free-ranging livestock.
He wants the Chilean Government to enact a strict management plan for the park and estimates it would take at least $1 million to develop trails and facilities for visitors to the sites. When an international group of scientists visited here last month, Dr. Ramirez appealed to them for assistance in calling world attention to the island's needs.
Dr. Ayres, the Oregon archeologist, said the Chileans had generally done a good job managing the archeological treasures. "But they have limited funds," he added. "Such a remarkable achievement by the Easter Island culture is of interest and importance to the whole world, and should be treated accordingly."
Dr. Van Tilburg said that in her years of work on the island she has seen the weathering effects on the statues. "All of us must find a way to preserve the statues, if not all of them, at least some," she said.
For her part, Dr. Van Tilburg has produced 5,000 detailed drawings and measurements of what the statues look like as the most complete documentation of the mystery of Easter Island and a legacy to future archeologists who will surely still be puzzling over the fate of a people who once lived alone in the vast emptiness of the sea.

HEADLINE: At Brunch, The More Bizarre The Better

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
WHEN the weekend arrives and the city's daytime motor shifts into idle, New York prepares to greet its favorite meal. It is called brunch, and it is weird. A linguistic and culinary hybrid, brunch is a breakfast that begins with a cocktail. Or a lunch that's organized around a stack of buckwheat pancakes. It's neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring, although all three can wind up on the same plate.
At Cafe Botanica, in the Essex House, patrons glide past a buffet table that starts with Danishes and bagels on one end, moves quickly to a mountain of peeled cold shrimp, and takes a sharp left turn toward a medley of Oriental dishes like vegetable dumplings with a soy dipping sauce and a three-color seaweed salad. 
 For sheer oddness, however, nothing on the table quite matches the sardine-potato tart at Home restaurant in Greenwich Village.
"We had a lot of mashed potatoes left over one Saturday night, and I remembered some sardines I'd seen at Murray's Cheese Shop, packed in salt," said David Page, Home's owner and chef, explaining the origin of the dish. "I came up with a kind of cake with a red bell-pepper sauce, and a poached egg on top." The dish, now served with a roasted tomato sauce, has never been off the menu since.
The strange world of brunch continues to expand, generating bizarre new life forms, embracing flavors and ingredients never before associated with mankind's pre-noon existence. There was a time when huevos rancheros represented the outer limit of brunchtime experimentation, but as chefs have ranged far and wide, and then farther and wider, in search of new influences, and as diners have adopted a global outlook, the always fluid boundaries of brunch have stretched to the breaking point.
No one is complaining -- not in New York, where every weekend the faithful line up outside hot spots like Isabella's on the Upper West Side, or Friend of a Farmer on Irving Place, or E.J.'s Luncheonette on the Upper East Side. Rain or shine, brunch lures everybody: couples who may or may not have met the night before, young people treating their parents, couples with children, young women in pairs or 10-strong gangs and, in the gay brunch belts of west Greenwich Village and Chelsea, men in pairs and big groups.
New Yorkers notoriously chafe at lines and delays, but come the weekend, they meekly tolerate a wait of 30 minutes for a crack at oysters on the half shell, baby spinach omelets and Irish steel-cut oatmeal.
For the hundreds of restaurants that routinely serve a Saturday brunch as well as the more traditional Sunday one, the brunch stampede is a bonanza. Popover Cafe, a 90-seat restaurant on the Upper West Side, serves nearly 500 brunches on a busy Sunday. Isabella's, a 195-seat restaurant on Columbus Avenue, serves 1,000 or more. Matthew's, on the Upper East Side, does its biggest business of the week at Sunday brunch. "Any restaurant that's open for brunch is packed," said John Villa, the executive chef at Park View at the Boathouse, in Central Park. "It's guaranteed business."
Chefs hate brunch. "They hate cooking it and they hate thinking about it," Bobby Flay, the chef at Mesa Grill, said. "Saturday night tends to be the busiest of the week, and they've probably gone out to have a few drinks afterward. Suddenly it's Sunday morning and you have to come in and cook eggs." Mr. Flay says that he happens to love brunch, but on this issue, he is out there alone.
Mr. Villa said: "To me, it's one of the hardest menus to write. You have to have a balance, but you can't have too many breakfast items, because the meal carries on until 4 P.M." In his case, that means a Thai-influenced shrimp frittata and a grouper club sandwich side by side with granola and yogurt.
If chefs seem to be taking license with brunch, that's because freedom is written into the charter of this oddity among meals.
Although the meal itself came to glory in the United States, the word is a British invention, coined in 1895 by Guy Beringer in a visionary article titled "Brunch: A Plea."
Instead of England's early Sunday dinner, a postchurch ordeal of heavy meats and savory pies, the author wrote, why not a new meal, served around noon, that starts with tea or coffee, marmalade and other breakfast fixtures before moving along to the heavier fare?
By eliminating the need to get up early on Sunday, brunch would make life brighter for Saturday-night carousers. It would promote human happiness in other ways as well.
"Brunch is cheerful, sociable and inciting," Beringer wrote. "It is talk-compelling. It puts you in a good temper, it makes you satisfied with yourself and your fellow beings, it sweeps away the worries and cobwebs of the week."
More than a century later, Beringer's template for brunch remains as valid as the day it was created, perhaps because, in drafting his culinary declaration of independence, he was not overly specific about what dishes should be served. He demanded "everything good, plenty of it, variety and selection." In a postscript, he suggested that beer and whisky could be served instead of coffee and tea, laying down a precedent for the mimosa, the Bloody Mary and the screwdriver.
It took a while for brunch to drift across the Atlantic, but after World War I, Americans embraced brunch and made it their own. The Jazz Age even created a novelty, a kind of second brunch that filled the gap between dinner and the last, mad grab for excitement as dawn poked its intrusive rosy finger into the party.
The Nation, noting that brunch had hitherto been a meal for poor students and "the lie-abed lady," described with some amusement the mad 5 A.M. dash for sausages, pancakes and "doughnuts, as dainty and sugared as our grandmother never knew how to make them." Then it was back to the dance floor for "camel walks and other steps from the zoo."
What might Beringer have made of the "Sunday Strollers' Brunch" served at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in the 1940's, with its sauerkraut juice, its clam cocktails, its chicken liver omelet in Madeira, its calf's liver with hash browns, its Scotch woodcock? Or House & Garden's brunch recipe, offered in 1952, for rice almond pancakes served with herbed shad roe? "A delicate hash, light fish balls, and liver and bacon are all appropriate," one women's magazine wrote in the 1920's.
Well, Beringer asked for variety and selection, which is exactly what the brunch menu at the River Cafe offers. Diners can start with Cheddar soup or codfish cakes before advancing to omelets and pancakes. At Mesa Grill, you can lead into the cinnamon and pecan waffles or ranch-style eggs with a cornmeal-coated chili relleno filled with goat cheese or a grilled white corn taco wrapped around barbecued pork, potatoes and tomatillo relish.
"It's as much a state of mind as it is a meal," said Michael McLaughlin, who ruled that chili, pizza and leg of lamb did not belong in the brunch section of his cookbook "Good Mornings," but chili-rubbed steaks, Gruyere fondue and brownies did.
"Breakfast has regional differences, but it is more clear-cut," he said. "Brunch is much more eclectic, although I would say that it has to be on a weekend, it has a festive aspect to it, and it's social. You never have brunch alone, while breakfast for one is perfect, in my opinion."
Brunch may be short on rules, but people have strong feelings about what makes a good one. "I like the fun of all the different foods you can get," Elizabeth England, a writer, said. Lara Shriftman, a public relations executive, said she gravitates toward Friend of a Farmer because it feels "very country, earthy."
Mr. Page, of Home, says it is no coincidence that family groups turn out for a meal at a restaurant with a name like his, as though searching for the ideal, family-around-the-table experience that Americans regard wistfully on the television screen but never actually put into practice.
Brunch spells warmth, abundance and homeyness. It is, in many of its associations, an invitation to go back to childhood. "People respond to the smell of coffee and bacon in the morning," said Carrie Levine, the chef and owner of Good Enough to Eat, a cozy restaurant on the Upper West Side. "It reminds you of childhood, when someone was cooking for you."
Ms. England said, "I like those places that have that homey, baked-goody sort of feel."
Ms. Levine has observed that bad economic news somehow translates into increased brunch business, as nail-chewing traders and brokers seek solace in the foods that bring them back to a simpler time.
The downside of this gentle picture is that, for the restaurant staff, brunch can be hell. It's not easy feeding hundreds of children.
"Brunch people tend to be very fussy," Marc Propper, the owner of Grove in Greenwich Village, said. "They want their eggs this way, not that way, they want sauce on the side. The list of special requirements goes on and on." One customer actually insisted that the staff butter his toast. "We didn't do it," Mr. Propper said. "We had to draw the line somewhere."
Ms. Levine has seen the same customers. "Even the words they use when ordering tend to be childish," she said. "They'll say they don't want their bacon mushy."
Who can blame them, really? New York is a tough town. No wonder its citizens wake up on Saturday and Sunday desperate for a little coddling, and ready for a spiritual return to the wholesome, abundant meals that good folks out in the heartland are eating. They want lemon ricotta pancakes, a lobster and arugula omelet, and a nice cold pitcher of tequila punch. What's so odd about that?

HEADLINE: National Origins: Moxee City, Wash.;
So Difficult In the Field, So Sweet On the Tongue

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL 

DATELINE: MOXEE CITY, Wash., July 2

 BODY:
They were about to start the Rainiers, and Bob Harris was getting himself psyched up. "This is a crazy business," he said, "and anyone who can do anything else should stay out of it."
The business at hand was cherries in this, the nation's prime cherry country, with its acres of luscious garnet Bings and Lamberts, and especially Rainiers, which are some of the sweetest and most highly prized cherries in the world. 
 The day before Mr. Harris begins harvesting his Rainier cherries is a tense time. Hundreds of thousands of dollars hang in the balance. A rainstorm, even a few unexpected gusts of wind, can wipe out the work of a year in hours.
Most earlier-maturing cherries had already been picked, Mr. Harris said. If his Rainiers and some even later cherries came in without incident, it might even be a record crop -- or close.
A relatively new variety, the Rainier was developed at the Washington State University experimental station at Prosser in the 1960's, and it is a cross between the well-known Bing and the little-known Van. The Rainier costs an average of about $2 a pound retail in the United States, but connoisseurs in Taiwan and Hong Kong are willing to pay 10 times that.
Balding and 50-ish, tanned and fit, Mr. Harris grows his cherries, some 300 acres, here in the Yakima Valley, 150 miles southeast of Seattle. He pretends not to like what he does.
I had flown down from the West Side, as people in the hot, dry eastern part of Washington refer to the western slope of the Cascades, which is green, wet and cool. On the drive over to Mr. Harris's, the woman on NPR said it was 64 in Seattle; the dusty thermometer outside Bob Harris's dusty office read 98.
Yakima County produces more cherries than most states. Of course, this one county is almost as large as Connecticut. But cherries are just for starters: the county also produces more apples, more hops, more winter pears than any other in America. It is rapidly becoming one of the most important areas in the country for wine grapes and, for good measure, leads the world in the production of mint.
Yakima farmers work hard, and the fertile land has repaid them, often handsomely. The old farmhouses have given way to spacious air-conditioned mansions. New cars are in every driveway, and private planes are not uncommon. Arizona vacations and foreign tariffs are as much a part of coffee shop gossip as taxes and rain.
Thanks to those dormant (well, mostly dormant) volcanoes off to the west -- Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens -- the soil here is largely volcanic and rich in nitrogen. Those snowcapped mountains give the Yakima Valley more than its fruitful soil. Rainfall here is about eight inches a year, so without Mount Rainier's melting snow, much of this verdant land would be a desert. There would be no cherry trees. Rainier, then, is a singularly appropriate name for the new star of these cherry orchards.
But as is the way with stars, the Rainier can be ornery.
"It's murder to grow," Mr. Harris muttered, almost as if he begrudged the fruit its popularity. "It bruises easily, and you have to go through the orchard three times. With other cherries, the whole tree ripens at once. Not with the Rainiers." Even so, he admitted, growers can't keep up with the demand. (In the New York area, Rainiers will be available in most fancy-food markets until the first week in August.)
All cherries are difficult to grow. Not for nothing have they been called the riskiest fruit. Their deadliest enemies are frost, birds and rain, with wind and hail not far behind. Rows of smudge pots in the growers' sheds (some in empty shell casings from a nearby Army artillery range) and airplane propellers mounted on tall shafts throughout the orchards (to circulate the warmed air) testify of the annual battle to fend off frost.
But it takes as much effort to pick 5 acres of Rainiers as it does 50 acres of dark cherries like Bings. Even on a given tree, Rainiers ripen at different rates.
Picking starts at 4 A.M. and ends at noon so the newly picked fruit won't have to sit out in the hot sun. Only skilled pickers work with Rainiers. For one thing, they can be handled only by their stems. Because they are so delicate and bruise so easily, no more than 30 percent of the crop goes into the premium packs. A picker may need two weeks to pick 24 trees, going to each one as many as eight times.
A flock of hungry birds can be as devastating as any frost.
"Look at this," Mr. Harris said, pulling a half-eaten Rainier from a tree. The bird hadn't nibbled much -- just enough to make it unsalable.
Colonists brought cherries to America in 1629. The fruit arrived in the Pacific Northwest with a pioneer named Henderson Lewelling, who planted seeds in western Oregon in 1847. America's best-known sweet cherry, the Bing, was developed on his farm in 1875. It was named for one of his Chinese workers.
Demand for the extra-sweet Rainiers is understandably high, but they make up less than 5 percent of the annual Northwest cherry crop. Bings, which make up about 85 percent of the crop here, begin to appear in supermarkets in mid-June and last until mid-August. They are the biggest cherries and at their best are mahogany colored, in both skin and flesh. The Rainiers, golden-colored with a reddish-pink blush and clear flesh, begin to arrive a week or two after the Bings show up and are available through the first week of August. A third variety, the Lambert, comes to market around the end of June and is available through mid-August. It looks and tastes like the Bing, but is a bit smaller.
The Bing and the Lambert contain 17 to 19 percent fruit sugar; the Rainier, 20 to 23 percent. That extra little percentage adds to the all-important sweetness and helps explain the cherry's popularity.
"The Rainier's only marketing problem is its color," Mr. Harris said. "People like rich color."
To give his Rainiers more color this year, he spread strips of gleaming Mylar film between the rows of trees, to bounce the sun's rays up into the lower branches much as suntan fanatics use reflective collars.
And big cherries sell better than small ones. Most growers carry a seven-hole plastic template in their back pockets. If a cherry fits through only the largest hole, it's called a nine-row; if it can get through the smallest, it's a twelve-row. The jargon dates back to earlier times when cherries were packed in small boxes. If the packers could fit only nine in a row, they had big cherries and were happy. With twelve-in-a-row cherries, they knew they would get less money per box. The boxes are bigger now, but the size principle hasn't changed.
Not all cherries are sweet. Tart cherries, once called sours, come mostly from the Midwest -- Michigan is a major producer. They are the best for canning. Each year about 30 percent of the sweet cherry crop is exported, mostly to Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Because of Japan's economic problems, the prospects for cherry sales there are "guarded" this year, said Eric Melton of Northwest Cherry Growers, the industry's promotional group, but he added that the Taiwan and Hong Kong markets are growing and might take up some of the slack. American cherries count as an exotic fruit in Asia.
Leaving Bob Harris warily eyeing his fruit-heavy Rainier trees, I drove over to Roy Farms, where Mark Roy was receiving flat boxes filled with newly picked cherries. The boxes, in stacks about six feet high, are rolled slowly though what looks like a large bathroom shower. The water, a frigid 35 degrees, drops the temperature of the delicate cherries to preserve them through the packing process, on what is called "the line."
A fourth-generation farmer in the Yakima Valley, Mr. Roy is a bit more relaxed than Mr. Harris, perhaps because the Roys are more diversified. "We started in hops," he said. "When that market died, we moved into apples, and when apples began to slow down, we got into cherries." The hops market slackened when the beer market stalled, but the 20-foot-tall plants are still highly visible throughout the Yakima Valley.
Temperature is everything in cherry shipping. Cherries destined for the Northeast travel directly from packing plants here to the Hunts Point Market in the Bronx in refrigerated trucks. "We put recorders in the trucks," said B. J. Thurlby, promotion director for the Washington State Fruit Commission. "It's a five-day trip to New York, and constant refrigeration at 32 degrees is expensive. Let's say some truckers might be tempted to turn it off now and then."
Cherries may be difficult to deal with, but these are relatively happy days in the Yakima Valley orchards. Demand in the United States continues to grow, and markets overseas are expanding, if slowly. Last year's crop, more than 90,000 tons of all the varieties grown here, was the largest on record, and the experts are predicting that as young trees come into production, crops of 110,000 tons and more are possible over the next five years.
Of course, conditions and tastes change. One day there might even be a glut. Chances of that are slim, though, because everyone who works in the business keeps eating cherries. As he walked through his orchard complaining, Mr. Harris kept pulling cherries off the trees.
"Try this," he'd say. "It's delicious."
I did. It was.
 
CHERRY AMARETTO FOLDED PIE
Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
From Katie Fuller, pastry chef, Macrina Bakery and Cafe, Seattle
 
2 cups stemmed and pitted sweet red cherries
2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur
 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 tablespoon flour
2 large eggs, separated into yolks and whites
1 12-inch round uncooked flaky pie dough (see recipe)
1 large egg white, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon coarse (decorative) sugar
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar.
1. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine cherries with amaretto and 1 tablespoon sugar. Let stand 20 minutes.
2. In another mixing bowl, combine remaining 1/2 cup sugar, ricotta cheese, vanilla extract, almond extract and flour. Separate eggs, and add yolks to ricotta mixture, mixing until well blended. Using an electric beater, whisk the two egg whites until stiff but not dry, and fold into the ricotta mixture.
3. On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, place the 12-inch round of dough. (It may overlap the edge of the pan.) Mound the ricotta mixture in the center of the dough, and top with the cherries; this will occupy about 8 inches of the center. Pull a 4-inch border up around the filling to make a free-form folded tart; make a round shape by folding a tuck every 2 inches, sealing the folds with beaten egg white. Brush the top of the crust with egg white, and sprinkle the center with coarse sugar. Chill by placing the tart, still on the baking sheet, in the freezer 20 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake tart until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle crust with confectioners' sugar, and serve warm.
Yield: One 8-inch pie (6 servings).
 
FLAKY PIE DOUGH
Time: 20 minutes, plus refrigeration
 
5 1/4 cups pastry flour or all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 3/4 cups solid vegetable shortening, chilled, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 cup ice water.
1. In bowl of an electric mixer, combine flour and salt, and stir to mix. Add butter, and mix on low speed until mixture is crumbly. Add shortening, and mix until large clumps form. Add just enough ice water (the full amount may not be needed) to make the dough cohere.
2. Turn dough onto a work surface, and gather it into a ball. Wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate at least 2 hours, and up to 5 days.
3. Divide dough into two, shape into balls and flatten into disks. Roll out dough as desired and use immediately, or freeze for up to 1 month.
Yield: 2 12-inch pie crusts.
 
CHERRY ICE CREAM
Time: 1 hour, beginning preparation 1 day ahead of serving
From Shelly Lance, pastry chef, Palace Kitchen, Seattle
 
3 1/2 cups sugar
2 1/2 cups stemmed, pitted and quartered cherries
 1/3 cup good-quality brandy or Cognac
3 cups heavy cream
3 cups milk
2 vanilla beans, split lengthwise
12 egg yolks.
1. Prepare the cherries and ice cream custard the day before making the ice cream. To macerate the cherries: In a medium saucepan, combine 2 cups of the sugar with 2 cups of water. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add the cherries, and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and transfer cherries and syrup to a bowl. Stir in brandy. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
2. To prepare the ice cream custard: In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, milk, vanilla beans and remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar. Heat until just beginning to steam, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until well combined. Add a ladleful of the hot milk mixture to the eggs while whisking vigorously, to warm and temper the yolks. Add the warmed yolks to the hot milk mixture, and return the pan to medium heat. Stir until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes; then, immediately pour it through a fine strainer into a clean container. Remove the vanilla beans from the strainer, and scrape the pulp from the vanilla beans into the custard. Cover the container, chill in a bowl of ice water and refrigerate overnight.
3. To finish the ice cream: Place a strainer over a bowl and drain the syrup from the cherries. Set the cherries aside, and discard the syrup or reserve for another use. Freeze the chilled custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Remove the ice cream from the machine while it is still slightly soft. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the cherries. Cover ice cream, and place in a freezer for a few hours or until completely firm.
Yield: 2 quarts.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices Drop for Treasury Securities in Line With Dollar's Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell for the first time in three days yesterday as the dollar slumped in world currency trading.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32, to 107 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.60 percent, from 5.57 percent Monday. 
Analysts pointed out that bonds have moved in tandem with the dollar recently. And yesterday the dollar slumped after statements from Japan increased expectations of an income tax cut to help pull that nation out of its recession.
Several media reported that a Japanese official said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had said that Government tax changes would include an income tax cut. Some analysts noted that the comments appeared to run counter to remarks the Prime Minister made the prior day.
Investors are watching to see to what extent the Japanese commit themselves to tax cuts, because a permanent cut could dry up the flight to United States Treasury securities, limiting further rallies in the American market. Still many remain convinced that the weakened Asian economies will place a drag on the United States economy and continue to help subdue inflation.
Doug Burtnick, an analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said trading was light and was mostly currency driven. "Currently," he said, "the bond market is trading very close to the high end of its most recent trading range, an indication that people now need to see more weakness in the economy before rates can go significantly lower."
In the municipal bond market yesterday, $1.02 billion of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport revenue bonds were priced through underwriters led by Salomon Smith Barney. The securities are in two parts with the bulk, $859.6 million series A, priced to yield a maximum 5.35 percent for a bond due in 2028. For a bond due in 2022, the yield was 5.33 percent. For shorter maturities, yields ranged from 4.30 percent for an issue due in 2002 to 5.31 percent for an issue due in 2019.
In the $163.6 million series B, the maximum yield was 5.22 percent for a bond due in 2028 and 5.19 percent for a bond due in 2023, with shorter maturities initially priced to yield from 4.25 percent in 2003 to 5.17 percent in 2018.
Both series carry insurance from the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation covering interest and principal payment, which gives the bonds a triple-A rating from Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Roughnecks Of Distinction;
Oilfield Workers Acquire Status in Labor Shortage

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: ABILENE, Tex.

 BODY:
For Daniel Shumate, a 32-year-old parolee, it's another chance to get his life on track. For Melissa Bolton, 23 and also a parolee, it's an opportunity to show that a woman can handle heavy work in the oilfields. For Ruben Garza, 20, it's a way to break out of toiling at minimum wage. And for Ben Hilgreth, 21, a college student, it's a way to build up a stake that he can use to invest.
While their goals vary, these four share a single dream: to make it in one of the most physically demanding, dangerous and at times technically challenging jobs around -- being a "roughneck," or laborer, on an oil rig. 
 Dripping with sweat, their clothes stained with grease and dirt, their bodies aching from wrestling with equipment weighing hundreds of pounds, they struggled recently to develop the skills and endurance needed for that life. The site was a school for roughnecks here, run by the Texas Engineering Extension Service, part of Texas A & M University.
With starting pay of $9 to $13 an hour, and with shifts that can last 12 hours -- a typical schedule is 14 days on, 14 days off -- a worker can eventually make more than $200 a day working on an offshore platform.
For everyone in this class of eight, becoming a "weevil," as new workers are called, would be a big step up the economic ladder. That is why they gave it their all in this monthlong class.
The school reopened in early April after closing four years ago, a victim of a boom that fizzled when oil prices hit bottom in the late 80's. That boom left such a glut of workers that for years new opportunities in the field were almost nonexistent.
When prices strengthened several years ago, though, oil service companies suddenly found that a whole generation of workers had vanished, and have been scrambling ever since to catch up.
So while oil prices have again fallen, hitting a nine-year low last month, the underlying need for new blood is so strong that there is still a healthy demand for all kinds of workers -- from starting laborers, or "roustabouts," to chemical engineers.
"In the 1980's, we lost an entire generation," said Gary Lee, vice president for human resources at Grey Wolf Drilling. "There is still a shortage of good skilled people."
This profession has been so volatile that even though Mr. Garza and two other graduates have gotten jobs, history seems to suggest that their budding careers could vanish at any moment.
Like Mr. Lee, though, many industry executives argue that it may be different this time -- that even if oil prices stay low, or drop more, the pool of skilled workers has shrunk so far that the labor shortage will persist for at least several years.
And even though smaller independent drillers have cut back, most larger oil companies are holding firm. They are in the midst of bringing large fields into production, projects that make economic sense despite unexpectedly low oil prices.
One reason the industry can withstand lower prices is that rapidly advancing technology brings down the cost and risks of finding oil.
No matter how high tech it gets, though, the industry still needs strong workers who can take the punishing 12-hour shifts and stay mentally alert. For they play a crucial role in bringing to the surface the vast amounts of oil and natural gas needed to supply the 74 million barrels a day the world now consumes.
Thus recruiters still come to the roughneck school to interview potential trainees.
New recruits could end up on rigs in the deserts of Kazakhstan, where temperatures range from 40 below in winter to 110 in summer, living in isolated barracks for a month at a time and then having a month back home. Or they could toil two weeks at a time on platforms in the North Sea, where storms send huge waves crashing into the concrete and steel structures.
Most get their start with smaller independent companies, then try to move to the majors, where jobs can be steadier and opportunities for advancement more numerous.
In the 1980's, the industry had plenty of experienced roughnecks. Though benefits and pensions were rare, the pay was high.
But "when the drilling stops, they're through with you," said Dennis Hooper, an instructor at the school who started to work as a roughneck when he was 15. He has seen boom and bust many times in his 54 years.
In 1983, a big drop in oil prices led to an almost decade-long retrenchment by oil companies. Tens of thousands of workers were forced to find other jobs or move away. Many were plunged into poverty.
By the time oil prices recovered and a sustained drilling boom took off, the pool of skilled labor had largely evaporated. "The contractors themselves have caused this," Mr. Hooper said, since little effort was made to keep skilled workers in the industry.
The lack of good entry-level workers has caused many drilling companies to begin their own training programs, and even offer benefits like health insurance and 401(k) plans.
Still, many companies now send more veteran managers into the field to supervise workers. Green workers, executives said, are prone to make mistakes while learning a variety of tasks, from painting and scraping to handling expensive equipment.
"It's scary," said Michael V. Ronca, president and chief executive of the Domain Energy Corporation, a medium-size Houston independent that does a lot of drilling and exploration in the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. "We have to send our experienced people to baby-sit."
Even after extensive training, roughnecks "don't know what they are doing sometimes," he said.
One time, he recalled, a worker was unable to turn off the water and ended up flooding equipment.
Suppliers can fall short, too, he said, recalling that Domain recently had to ship back 34,000 feet of defective pipe -- pipe that had passed four sets of inspectors.
Even though the jobs basically take brawn and endurance, one cannot just walk off the street and become a roughneck. Working a drill rig takes teamwork and coordination, with even simple jobs on platforms, like cleaning and painting, involving an element of risk.
Wayne H. Davis, who runs the school and coordinates its safety program, told one class that in Alaska the decks of offshore platforms are about 150 feet above the freezing water, with currents often running at 30 to 40 knots.
"If you fall off," he said, "they've got five minutes to get you."
He also warns students about hydrogen sulfide, a highly poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs. When released in drilling, it can quickly overcome workers and, in high concentrations, even kill them if they don't make a quick exit or don a protective mask.
And Mr. Davis repeatedly stressed the importance of teamwork. "It takes a while to fit in with everybody," Mr. Hooper stressed. "If you're in a crew that doesn't know what they are doing, it gets pretty tense."
Some of the trainees did not finish the course because they found the adjustment difficult, he said, adding, "You have to have that grit."
Ms. Bolton seemed to have it. After several weeks, she was able to maneuver huge wrench-like tools that weigh 500 pounds. During a training session, amid the roar of motorized drill bits and winches, she moved them smoothly just in time to tighten and loosen drilling pipe.
A couple of months ago, she recalled, she was working as a nursing-home aide for $4.35 an hour. When her parole officer told her she could learn the trade that her father and brother made their living at, she jumped at the chance.
A chunky woman with brown hair gathered into a ponytail under her hard hat, she worked quietly and comfortably with the young men on the rig, training herself for the rigors ahead.
She realized she would have a harder time proving she is up to the challenge. "They wonder, 'Can she do it?' " she said. "It just makes me want to prove more that I can."
Mr. Hilgreth, a wiry University of Texas student, was attracted by the numerous ads offering jobs, but, when he called, found that everyone wanted experienced people. He decided to quit college for a while and come to the school.
"I want to make enough to invest in something," he said, taking quick drags on a cigarette during a lunch break.
With oil prices dropping again, the bloom of the upturn has begun to fade. Rates for drilling rigs have begun to fall as smaller companies have cut back. Wells that made sense to drill when oil was $18 to $20 a barrel do not at the recent $13 to $14.
Randy Smith, an assistant drilling superintendent for Key Energy, a local drilling contractor, had all his 32 rigs working earlier this year. To attract reliable, skilled workers, his company raised the basic starting wage from $9.35 an hour in November to $12.35 and began offering 401(k) plans.
The recent decline in oil prices, however, has caused him to mothball about half the rigs.
And other smaller companies have begun to lay off workers as they shut down less productive wells.
Mr. Smith said that most smaller independent oil companies were waiting to see what happened on the world stage.
At a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna in June, leading oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela were able to put together cuts of 1.4 million barrels a day. Combined with cuts from non-OPEC countries like Mexico and Norway, this has led to total reductions of close to 3 million barrels a day.
It is unclear how far these cuts will go in helping oil prices recover because demand may also fall because of recessions in big oil-importing nations like Japan.
"We're like puppets on a string," Mr. Smith said.
In a way, so are the graduates.
Mr. Garza, a strapping 6 feet 2 inches tall, has just started working with a crew near Laredo, Tex., for Grey Wolf Drilling. He is working 12-hour shifts, from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M., seven days straight. He earns $10 an hour, but after 40 hours in a week, he gets the $15 overtime rate. When he is working, he lives in a six-bunk trailer with 10 other workers in the middle of a desolate area, often battered by wind-borne dust, where temperatures can reach 110 degrees. About the only diversion is satellite television.
At this point, he often does the simple tasks, like fetching wrenches, tying cables and using his powerful arms to lock down nuts and bolts. His concern is whether this job will last.
Recently some of his co-workers were laid off, but he was kept on because of his training.
For Daniel Shumate, who had been driving a cement truck for $8 an hour -- not enough to enable him to own a car -- the school is his chance to "make it into the middle bracket." After waiting for a over a month and a half he just landed a job with an oil well service company starting at $6.25 an hour and has several prospects to work on an offshore platform at much higher pay. He wants to make it since if things don't work out he said, "I'm back to square one."

HEADLINE: Conseco Expects $498 Million Charge

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CARMEL, Ind., July 7

 BODY:
Conseco Inc., a life and health insurer, said on Monday that its purchase of the Green Tree Financial Corporation, a lender to buyers of manufactured homes, would strip $498 million from second-quarter earnings.
Conseco said $350 million of the charge came from securities that Green Tree created from its loans that were paid off earlier than expected as interest rates fell. The remaining $148 million was related to severance costs and the investment banking, legal and accounting fees from its $5.76 billion purchase of St. Paul-based Green Tree on June 30. 
 Conseco's chairman, Stephen Hilbert, who built the company, based in Carmel, Ind., using 20 acquisitions in the last 16 years, said he expected the purchase of Green Tree to add to third- and fourth-quarter earnings and to increase next year's profit as much as 3.5 percent.
The falling value of Green Tree's securities reflects the drop in rates that prompted borrowers to refinance loans on prefabricated homes. When Green Tree makes a loan, it typically sells the right to principal payments and keeps the interest payments. So-called interest-only bonds decline quickly in value when rates fall because early home-loan payments eliminate future cash flows.

HEADLINE: California's Budget Struggle Is Bitter Despite Big Surplus

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 7

 BODY:
Gov. Pete Wilson began his tenure here seven summers ago with the largest budget gap that any state ever faced, a $14.3 billion shortfall that forced him and the Legislature to raise $7 billion in new taxes and slash spending by the same amount. The budget was finally passed 17 days after the July 1 deadline, and the next year, the wrangling was even worse, with a record 63-day standoff over how to spread the pain.
Now Mr. Wilson is in his last year in office, contemplating another run for the White House and eager to leave a legacy -- and California is once again without a budget one week into the new fiscal year. But this time, as in other state capitals this season, the fight is over what to do with a surplus -- $4.4 billion generated by the Golden State's booming economic recovery -- and while the question now is about cutting taxes and expanding services, the debate is just as bitter as before. 
 "This is a bigger problem, in a way," said John L. Burton, the beleaguered Democratic leader of the State Senate, who noted that a surplus -- in an election year to boot -- inspires less cooperation and more partisanship than in tough times.
Mr. Wilson agreed, saying dryly of his adversaries in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, "They seem to find it more difficult to come to grips with plenty."
Spurred on by states like Virginia and Arizona, where the issue has proven to be political catnip, Mr. Wilson and his fellow Republicans want a $3.6 billion cut in the state's vehicle license tax over the next four years. That would amount to a 75 percent reduction in the unpopular tax, a Depression-era relic that is based on 2 percent of a vehicle's value (adjusted by a set depreciation schedule) and translates into several hundred dollars a year for owners of newer cars. Such a cut would also allow Mr. Wilson to claim that, over all, he has reduced taxes more than he has raised them in his two terms.
Because the car tax revenues go to cities and counties to finance local services, the Democrats contend that cutting the tax could jeopardize police protection if the economy took a turn for the worse. Last week, in what was regarded as no more than an opening bid, the Democratic-controlled Senate unanimously passed an alternative, a one-year quarter-cent cut in the state's 6 percent sales tax, and on Monday, the Assembly followed suit. But Mr. Wilson derided the idea as "much too little and much too brief" and vowed to veto it.
Mr. Burton said in an interview that he expected face-to-face negotiations with the Governor and the Democratic Assembly Speaker, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, to begin soon, but the Assembly and Senate have yet to agree on an overall budget plan of their own. And Mr. Burton and Mr. Villaraigosa have held their posts for just a few months, replacing colleagues forced to move on by term limits, while Mr. Wilson, himself barred from seeking a third term, is a veteran with a proven stomach for budget standoffs.
And despite being in his last year as Governor, Mr. Wilson enjoys strong advantages in the state's Constitution. It requires a two-thirds vote in each house to pass the budget, making it hard for the Democrats to peel off enough Republicans to force the Governor's hand, and it gives the Governor line item veto power to punish legislators by cutting their pet projects.
"The smart money is looking at late August now," said Dan Schnur, a former top aide to Mr. Wilson who is a political consultant in San Francisco. "In the past, the choices have been so painful that they led to paralysis. It takes two or three months to decide whether you're going to take guide dogs away from blind people. But there isn't any road map for what they're dealing with now."
In an interview today, Mr. Wilson said that it should not take so long to reach agreement, but he added that he would not be surprised if it did, noting that "there doesn't seem to be even common direction" among the Democrats. And the Governor dismissed any notion that the surplus is a short-term phenomenon. Beginning two years ago, with the recovery reaching full force, the state's revenue collections started exceeding forecasts, and there was a somewhat smaller surplus last year, though Mr. Wilson curtailed debate over how to spend it by unilaterally using most of it to replenish a state pension fund.
"We keep having these non-recurring surpluses," he said sardonically, adding that this situation means "California's tax structure takes too big a bite." Mr. Wilson argues that the vehicle tax, which costs the average car owner $185 a year, is particularly onerous and affects almost everyone in a state with 24 million registered vehicles, more than there are houses. His proposal would save the average owner $135 a year.
Twenty states, including New York and New Jersey, impose no value-based taxes on motor vehicles, opting for flat annual registration fees. But the 30 other states impose either a personal property tax on cars or, like California, a value-based tax in lieu of property tax.
In California's case, the car tax is the sole legacy of the state's old personal property tax, in which assessors visited homes each year to survey the value of contents. But cars were always mysteriously absent from driveways on assessment day, so in 1935 the state abandoned the personal property tax in favor of a tax on cars, imposed at annual registration.
A recent survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures found considerable support around the nation for rolling back such taxes, after the successful candidacy for governor of James S. Gilmore 3d in Virginia, who campaigned last year on a platform of reducing that state's local property tax on automobiles. Since then, states including Kansas, Kentucky, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Arizona have either passed reductions or are considering them.
"This tax is particularly disliked," said Mandy Rafool, a conference policy analyst who conducted the study. "People hate property taxes in general and this is a big chunk at once."
All the players here agree that there will be a tax cut, with the only question how big. Both sides are also proposing more spending on education, with the Democrats demanding more than Mr. Wilson has offered. But the Governor repeated today that he was "not interested in temporary relief" from taxes and said that the Legislature had so far offered no more than "this little drill."
As for Mr. Burton, an old Sacramento hand on his second career after a stint here and in Congress collapsed as a result of alcohol and drug abuse, he said in the interview, "All I want is to get out alive."

HEADLINE: The Battle Over Hog Factories

 BODY:
Hogs used to be a staple of the small-farm economy. But as American agriculture has grown more specialized, they have begun to be raised in concentrated numbers in confinement systems. These operations contain between 2,000 and 100,000 sows, which eat, excrete and reproduce in metal barns with concrete floors. The waste is stored in lagoons and eventually sprayed on fields.
Livestock has always played an essential role in the biological cycle of agriculture. But hogs raised in enormous confinement systems no longer belong to the biological cycle. Their manure is now a pollutant. 
 Until recently, the fastest growth in hog production occurred in North Carolina, but now the battle over the impact of hog confinement systems is a national one. In Milford, Utah, the four largest North Carolina hog producers have constructed a facility, called Circle 4 Farms, that will eventually hold 100,000 sows. In Colorado and South Dakota, ballot initiatives have been proposed to limit large-scale pork producers.
Some of the problems with giant confinement systems are obvious. There are the problems of odor and ground-water contamination from leaking lagoons. When liquefied hog manure is distributed over spray fields, it is done at a rate that far exceeds the fertilizer needs of the soil to which it is applied, often causing further contamination. Strong evidence has been gathered to show that the nitrogen in manure lagoons evaporates and is redeposited in what scientists call nutrient-sensitive waters, like those of coastal North Carolina, resulting in oxygen depletion and fish kills.
The battle over hog factories is really a battle over the definition of farming and the legal consequences that follow from that definition. Large-scale pork producers have always sited their facilities where zoning is nonexistent or could be weakened. But farmers, by any reasonable definition of the word, have nothing in common with large-scale pork producers, except when they enter corporate servitude and agree to raise hogs on contract. Consumers are slowly learning that they have nothing to gain from factory hog production either, except cheap pork chops, which by any realistic measure of environmental or social value are far more costly than they seem.

In All His Feathered Glory

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Erik Tarloff's mother cut a deal with his father.
"If Frank Sinatra ever came on to her, she was allowed to go with him for one night, with no repercussions in the marriage," he recalls. 
 Mr. Tarloff, a writer who saw Washington from a rare perspective as the husband of a Cabinet-level official, the former Clinton chief economic adviser Laura D'Andrea Tyson, thought of his mother's groupie exemption when he wrote his new Washington novel, "Face-Time."
The book, not yet published, is about a young woman who works in the White House, along with her boyfriend, a speechwriter. She succumbs to the advances of a Clintonesque President because she feels it is an experience that transcends infidelity, and even sex.
Or, as Marilyn Monroe mused to her psychiatrist about her relationship with J.F.K.: "Marilyn Monroe is a soldier. . . . The first duty of a soldier is to obey her Commander in Chief."
When all is said and done, Bill Clinton's biggest legacy may not be in politics, but in letters. Aside from the flock of fiction and nonfiction books written about our intriguing President, he has inspired one entirely new and remarkable genre: feminist erotic journalism.
After decades spent trying to dissuade powerful men from thinking they can have their way with less powerful women, feminists now have a terrible confession: They pant for power. They crave droit du seigneur. Take me! Take me!
First Larissa MacFarquhar wrote of Monica Lewinsky in The New Yorker that "It would be a rare young woman who could resist . . . a chance to sleep with a man who is (a) the President and (b) a babe."
Then 10 women, including some feminists, a fashion designer and a retired dominatrix, participated in a panel for The New York Observer that resulted in a story headlined "New York Supergals Love That Naughty Prez."
"I think there has been a shift in the cultural climate since the time of the Anita Hill hearings," said Katie Roiphe, adding: "Now, this virile President is suddenly fulfilling this forbidden fantasy of this old-fashioned, taboo aggressive male. I think women are finding that appealing." Tina Brown wrote her bodice-ripping dispatch from the Tony Blair state dinner about Mr. Clinton: "His glamour is undersung . . . a man in a dinner jacket with more heat than any star in the room (or, for that matter, at the multiplex) . . . his height, his sleekness, his newly cropped, iron-filing hair, and the intensity of his blue eyes. . . . He is vividly in the present tense and dares you to join him there."
The latest swooner is Nina Burleigh, a former White House reporter for Time, who writes in Mirabella about a game of hearts with Mr. Clinton on Air Force One flying to Jasper, Ark., that made her tingle.
"The President's foot lightly, and presumably accidentally, brushed mine once under the table. His hand touched my wrist while he was dealing the cards. When I got up and shook his hand at the end of the game, his eyes wandered over my bike-wrecked, naked legs. And slowly it dawned on me as I walked away: He found me attractive. . . .
"There was a time when the hormones of indignant feminism raged in my veins. An open gaze like that, at least from a man of lesser stature, would have annoyed me. But that evening . . . I felt incandescent. It was riveting to know that the President had appreciated my legs, scarred as they were. If he had asked me to continue the game of hearts back in his room at the Jasper Holiday Inn, I would have been happy to go there and see what happened."
Amazingly, Nina outflutters Tina, casting Bill as Zeus in "Leda and the Swan": "Yeats honored the magnetic sexual pull a powerful male can have on a weaker female. The beating wings of the giant swan enwrap the helplessly infatuated woman, whose 'terrified vague fingers' cannot push the 'feathered glory from her loosening thighs.' "
Ms. Burleigh may have Presidential affairs on the brain since she just wrote a book about Mary Meyer, a J.F.K. paramour who was murdered. Defending her piece to The Washington Post, she noted that she would have happily had a certain kind of sex with Mr. Clinton "just to thank him for keeping abortion legal."
We should stop blaming Ally McBeal for killing feminism. We should even stop blaming Bill Clinton. It is clearly a mass suicide.

HEADLINE: Gore to Unveil Savings Bonds With Rates Tied to Inflation

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration plans to unveil a new type of Government savings bond on Wednesday with a return that will rise and fall with inflation to protect investors' gains as well as to help finance the Federal debt, Administration officials said today.
The bonds will be sold in eight denominations, $50 to $10,000, and will mature in 30 years. Most of the denominations, which bear the likenesses of Helen Keller, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Albert Einstein and others, are to go on sale in September. The $200 and $10,000 denominations will go on sale next May. 
 In announcing the new securities, Vice President Al Gore plans to promote them as an attractive means for middle-income people to prepare for retirement or a child's education.
Referring to the bonds as "inflation insurance," a senior Treasury official said today that he expected them "to be attractive for people who want to be able to guarantee that they're earning a substantial inflation-adjusted return on their money, that'll double their money in real terms in less than a generation."
As he prepares for the Presidential race in 2000, Mr. Gore is trying to burnish his economic credentials, one White House official said, and the Administration's decision to have him, rather than President Clinton, present the new bonds is part of that effort. Mr. Gore will make the announcement at the Treasury Department with Robert E. Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury.
In January 1997, the Treasury Department introduced its first inflation-indexed bonds, which were generally intended for large institutional investors. Until then, the Federal Government had financed the national debt by relying on fixed-rate securities, which have a set, unchanging interest rate. Such bonds, whose returns can be eroded or wiped out by inflation, have not been a popular option compared to stocks, corporate bonds, 401(k) plans and other forms of long-term savings.
The Clinton Administration hopes that the inflation-indexed bonds, or I-Bonds, will appeal to small investors.
"They're meant for and designed for small investors," one official said. "We think this is important to avail small investors of the same benefits of inflation protection that larger investors have."
Unlike other inflation-adjusted bonds, but like other savings bonds, the new securities offer special tax benefits. As long as investors hold their bonds, they may defer paying taxes on their earnings, which are automatically reinvested and added to the principal. The new bonds, like others issued by the Treasury, are exempt from state and local taxes.
The tax protection "would be a very nice feature for someone who is, say, several years from retirement and in a high-income bracket, who wants to protect his portfolio from inflation but without generating higher income," said Dan Pederson, president of The Savings Bond Informer, a Detroit-based information service for investors.
If the bond is redeemed to pay for college tuition or other college fees, investors may exclude part or all of the interest from their income in calculating their taxes.
The average American is far more likely to hold savings bonds than Treasury bonds: Roughly 55 million Americans, or about 1 in 3 households, own savings bonds, Mr. Pederson said. Investors hold about $180 billion in savings bonds, according to the Treasury Department.
Investors' earnings from the new bonds will be determined by two rates. One rate, set by the Treasury Department, will remain the same for the life of the bond. The second, a rate of inflation, will be determined every six months by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to reflect changes in a version of the Consumer Price Index.
Before any inflation adjustment the new bonds are expected to be offered at a rate ranging from 3 percent to 3.5 percent, less than the rate carried by fixed-rate securities that offer no inflation protection.
Investors in the bonds will have some protection if deflation sets in. Any decline in the Consumer Price Index could eat into the fixed rate, but would not touch the underlying principal, officials said.
Mr. Gore has given two major speeches recently on the economy, one in the spring before the Economic Club of Detroit and one last month before the Center for National Policy here. White House aides said that announcement on Wednesday was intended to remind voters of Mr. Gore's role in the Administration's economic policy.
"The whole idea is to start building his profile more and more on the economy, for obvious reasons," one official said.
Mr. Gore has also stepped up his partisan commentary on economic matters. His speech before the Center for National Policy amounted to a sharp critique of Republican economic policies. He accused the Republican-controlled Congress of threatening to "unravel our fiscal discipline, even at the risk of raising interest rates, shattering confidence in our economy and squandering the resources we need to finally close the generational deficit."

HEADLINE: Jailed Nigerian Dies Amid Envoys' Visit

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner, Moshood K. O. Abiola, died today, apparently of a heart attack, further complicating an already turbulent political situation in Africa's most populous country.
Mr. Abiola, who was 60 years old, became ill while meeting with American and Nigerian officials at a government guest house in Abuja, the capital. He died shortly afterward in a hospital, American and Nigerian officials said.
 James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said in Washington, "We do not have any reason to believe this is anything but natural causes." But at least one of Mr. Abiola's children said the death was suspicious, and another said the Government that had kept her father imprisoned and denied him medical care was culpable in his death. 
 The Nigerian Government promised a full, prompt autopsy in cooperation with Mr. Abiola's personal physicians.
Mr. Abiola's death was the second stunning development in Nigeria in less than a month. On June 8, Gen. Sani Abacha, the unrelenting dictator who had thrown Mr. Abiola into jail in 1994, died suddenly of a heart attack.
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, General Abacha's successor, had been expected to free Mr. Abiola, the apparent victor in Nigeria's aborted 1993 elections, soon. The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, said after meeting Mr. Abiola in Nigeria last week that Mr. Abiola had promised to forswear his claim to the presidency and work toward a smooth transition to democracy.
Mr. Rubin said Mr. Abiola fell ill today while speaking to Thomas R. Pickering, the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, and Susan E. Rice, the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs.
"In the first 10 minutes, Abiola starts wheezing and coughing and then collapsing in some form," Mr. Rubin told reporters here. "I don't know if he lost consciousness. They get him in an ambulance or car. They get him to the hospital, where he dies."
Mr. Pickering told National Public Radio that when Mr. Abiola came into the meeting he appeared to be in good health and good spirits, but that his condition quickly deteriorated and that he began to cough and was "clearly disturbed."
Mr. Pickering, speaking by telephone to N.P.R., explained that Mr. Abiola excused himself from the meeting, went to a restroom, then returned in more distress. "When he came out of the toilet, he asked for painkillers," Mr. Pickering said, "and then sat on a couch and was overheated and asked for the room to be cooled, and removed some of his garments, and then clearly began to suffer."
Mr. Pickering said he took Mr. Abiola's pulse and said he was "clearly very cold and very disturbed and in some significant pain."
Mr. Abiola was taken to a hospital, accompanied by the American officials, who watched as doctors worked to save him, Mr. Pickering told the radio program "All Things Considered."
Mr. Pickering's delegation extended its stay until Wednesday.
Hafsat Abiola, the 23-year-old daughter of Mr. Abiola, blamed the Nigerian military for her father's death. In a telephone interview from suburban Maryland, where she lives with 5 of her 18 siblings, Ms. Abiola said: "My position is simple. My father was in their custody. Anything that happened to him while he was in their custody is their responsibility. I can't believe they did this."
Her father had not been well lately, Ms. Abiola said, adding that she had repeatedly asked Nigerian authorities to let a doctor see him. An American official involved in African policy said that Mr. Abiola suffered from high blood pressure and swollen limbs.
Another daughter, Wura Abiola, told C.N.N. that the family considered the death "very suspicious."
Mr. Annan said today that he had attempted to inquire about Mr. Abiola's health when he met with him last week. "He was alert and asked questions. But it was obvious from the questions that he was in isolation," Mr. Annan said. "For example, he didn't know who I was. I walked in, shook hands and smiled and started asking about his health. He asked, 'Who are you?' And I explained that I'm the Secretary General of the United Nations. And then he asked: 'What happened to the Egyptian? Is he gone?' " a reference to Mr. Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
Mr. Annan, who spoke in an impromptu news conference at the United Nations today, said: "I'm not in a position to describe the conditions under which he was kept. But he did say that he had been in solitary confinement and was allowed no television, no press, no media except the Bible and the Koran."
Mr. Annan added, "I hope the Government of Nigeria will make good on its pledge to release all remaining political prisoners unconditionally and to define a credible process for the transition to civilian rule."
Mr. Abiola's release had been delayed, in part because Mr. Abiola's followers, mainly members of the Yoruba tribe in southwestern Nigeria, around the old capital of Lagos, insisted that he should be permitted to take office. In Lagos today some rioting and looting was reported after the news of Mr. Abiola's death, Reuters reported.
The Government, which is dominated by Hausa officers from Northern Nigeria, now faces the possibility of severe tribal tensions. In the late 1960's, the Ibo and their allies in southeastern Nigeria precipitated a civil war when they proclaimed the independent state of Biafra. Diplomats have expressed fears in the last few weeks that violence may lie just beneath the surface now.
Any fighting in Nigeria, which with its oil and natural resources has the potential for being the richest country in sub-Saharan Africa, could destabilize the weaker neighboring countries.
Encouraged by Mr. Annan and Western leaders to move his country onto the road to democracy, General Abubakar has already released Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler, and 25 other political prisoners, but 250 or more still remain in Lagos jails, intelligence officials said. Many of them are not nearly as prominent as Mr. Abiola, a wealthy businessman and tribal chief.
Mr. Rubin said Mr. Pickering "had not received agreement in terms of a firm timetable to let Abiola out, but the Government did make clear that he would be out soon."
President Clinton, in a written statement released today, said, "I was deeply saddened to learn of the sudden and untimely death of M. K. O. Abiola, a distinguished citizen and patriot of Nigeria."
Nigeria remains in economic chaos, ravaged by corruption and incompetence. Despite the country's immense oil reserves -- it is the fifth-largest supplier of petroleum to the United States -- motorists are forced to wait for hours at the small number of functioning filling stations.
Limited sanctions imposed by the United States and others have compounded the country's difficulties. General Abacha ignored the rest of the world but General Abubakar has appeared eager to reach out to friendly nations.
Mr. Annan's mission to Nigeria, which was not announced in advance, followed several telephone conversations with General Abubakar and a secret meeting with the Nigerian Foreign Minister, according to William Shawcross, a British journalist who covered the Annan visit. Mr. Shawcross said General Abubakar told the Secretary General that he wanted to hand power back to a democratically elected government but implied that some other generals were not so sure.

HEADLINE: In Interior Design, a Clash of Rivals;
Owner of Uptown Center Wants Promotional Street Signs

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Just before an annual design and furnishings trade show in Manhattan last fall, a block of East 58th Street sprouted a new, chintz-draped street sign proclaiming it "Designers Way," and East 59th Street was transformed into "Decorators Way."
The new look was temporary, but now the managers of the Decoration and Design Building at 979 Third Avenue, home to 130 showrooms serving the high-end interior-design business, have asked the city to make the designation permanent. They say signs flanking the building would be a fitting recognition of a swatch of the East Side that is the heart of their industry -- really the only place to turn if you need $4,000 worth of suede to cover a client's sofa, say, or some very nice hand-embroidered silk for $2,000 a yard. 
 And who could object to such a harmless bit of industry boosterism? Well, the management of a competing design building, for starters. The owners of the New York Design Center, located at 200 Lexington Avenue at 32d Street, say the designation would give an unfair advantage to the Upper East Side building, and have enlisted the aid of a City Councilman who vows to block the new names.
The dispute between the rival buildings, known in the industry as the D and D Building and 200 Lex, has led to some nasty exchanges, with designers and wholesalers taking sides and questioning the motives -- or worse, the taste -- of their opponents.
"When I'm looking for things, it would never enter my mind to go to 200 Lex," said Robert Bray, a Manhattan interior designer. "It's so middle-class to me."
Things have changed, retorted another Manhattan designer, Adam Dolle. "Decorating was an Upper East Side kind of phenomenon," he said. "But that's not true anymore. Everyone goes everywhere."
In fact, the street sign debate is one small indication of broader changes roiling the world of interior design. Once almost entirely concentrated on the Upper East Side, showrooms sporting a "to the trade" sign -- the signal that, in theory at least, a customer must be accompanied by a decorator -- have migrated to neighborhoods like Chelsea, SoHo and the Flatiron District.
And the D and D Building's effort to market itself and other nearby establishments as the center of the design universe comes as the industry is trying to broaden its reach. The showrooms are seeking to draw a new class of customers who can afford fine furnishings but may have found the idea of hiring a decorator intimidating or simply unnecessary, given the growing number of high-end furniture stores that sell directly to the public.
The D and D Building and 200 Lex, for example, both offer referral services for customers without a decorator in tow.
"The reality is that a lot of people have good taste, but they don't know how to put it all together," said Michael Love, president of Interior Options, the referral service at 200 Lex. "We want to make them feel comfortable about using professional help."
In another break with the industry's fustier traditions, a major fabric house with a showroom at the D and D Building, Brunschwig & Fils, began accepting credit cards, mainly from decorators who in turn bill their clients, a few months ago. Paying with plastic is still unheard of at most showrooms, which have traditionally demanded payment in advance by check, an arrangement that offers less protection for dissatisfied customers. "We decided to do it because more and more clients of ours were asking for it," said Hans Denbroeder, showroom manager at Brunschwig.
James P. Druckman, president of the New York Design Center, argued that the changes in the industry rendered the notion of a designated design corridor obsolete. "I think the story is that New York itself is a design center," he said.
But Charles Steven Cohen, president of the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation, which owns the D and D Building, professed astonishment at the reception his proposal had received. "I never in a million years suspected that 200 Lex would take umbrage," he said. "We are the center of the design industry."
Mario Buatta, a New York decorator whose clients have included Barbara Walters and Malcolm Forbes, agreed with Mr. Cohen that there really was no room for debate. "The D and D Building is perfection," he declared. "I'm not going to mention names, but if it's not in the D and D Building, you never remember to go there."
Mr. Druckman has found an unlikely ally in Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, a Republican whose district includes the D and D Building but not 200 Lex. Mr. Eristoff said he moved to block the name change -- which requires Council approval -- when he concluded that the D and D Building was trying to gain an unfair advantage over its long-standing competitor. "This is an attempt to trump a rival in a highly commercial dispute," said Mr. Eristoff, who added that he had received a number of complaints about the proposed designation.
The more D and D officials have pressed for the signs, the more they have antagonized Mr. Eristoff. He said he was outraged when Mr. Cohen asked State Senator Roy M. Goodman, another East Side Republican, to intervene in the dispute. Now Mr. Eristoff said he would oppose even another temporary renaming for this fall's design show, which D and D officials have sought from the city's Transportation Department.
Still, a number of prominent designers agree with Mr. Cohen that the neighborhood surrounding the D and D Building is the focal point of their industry, and they give credit both to the booming economy and to the current management for the building's success after several lean years.
In the two years since Cohen Brothers Realty bought 979 Third for $67 million from the Travelers Group, which had acquired it in a foreclosure, occupancy has risen from 70 percent to 100 percent, with a waiting list of about 50 companies, Mr. Cohen said. Some tenants are now paying annual rent as high as $70 a square foot, he said. (Mr. Druckman said he was asking $30 a square foot.)
For years, many designers looked down on 200 Lex, saying it catered mainly to the lower end of the market. Built in 1926 as the New York Furniture Exchange, the building was converted in 1981 from a marketplace for retail stores into showrooms for decorators and designers. It includes a number of office furniture showrooms, some of them refugees from the ill-fated International Design Center in Long Island City, Queens, which emptied out after the stock market crash of 1987.
But 200 Lex, which has 87 showrooms, is taking steps to burnish its image. Mr. Druckman, whose family has been involved with the building since it opened, has attracted new, prestigious tenants like Wood & Hogan, which sells English period furniture and reproductions. Other longtime high-end tenants include Odegard, which carries hand-woven Tibetan rugs and Venetian lamps with hand-painted silk shades inspired by turbans, shields and pagodas.
"We're more user-friendly than any other design building in town, because we were built just to display furniture," Mr. Druckman said -- a pointed reminder that the D and D Building was built in 1964 as an apartment house, although it was never inhabited. From the outset, it has been used as a design house, and tenants and decorators constantly complain that the elevators are ill equipped for heavy traffic.
Since plans for redoing the living room are often the first thing to be jettisoned when the economy sours, the D and D's fortunes have usually depended on the stock market. Robert Lee Tinker, a former leasing director at 979 Third who now holds the same position at 200 Lexington, said about a dozen companies were behind in their rent when Cohen Brothers Realty bought the building and took over its management from the Merchandise Mart of Chicago.
Most of those tenants are gone now, and a number of well-established companies, like Stark, Donghia and Brunschwig & Fils, have enlarged their showrooms. Although they also carry furniture, they specialize in products like carpets and fabrics that are less vulnerable to swings in the economy.
"I wanted to be able to accommodate the expansion of the brand names and improve the credit-worthiness of the tenants," Mr. Cohen said. "The mom-and-pop showrooms gave way to larger vendors."
Mr. Cohen has added Astra Cafe, an upscale restaurant managed by Charlie Palmer, the owner of Aureole, and begun sprucing up the corridors and the building's lobby (a somewhat perilous undertaking, given that his tenants tend to have very definite ideas when it comes to interiors). Not to be outdone, Mr. Druckman plans to convert the cafe in his building into a more elegant restaurant.
Mr. Druckman, who provides bus service between 200 Lex and the D and D Building to make it easier for decorators to get to his showrooms, said he had tried in vain to get Mr. Cohen to cooperate with him by, for example, holding a joint trade fair. "It would create a broader market week for the city," he said, "but they want to do their own thing."
Mr. Cohen said he did not see the value of joining forces on a trade fair, but he did not rule out other ventures with Mr. Druckman. "I've tried to work with him," he said, "but he's very interested in his own personal ends."

Counting Heads (and Potential Wallets) to Help Sell Midtown

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Anyone walking through the intersection of Seventh Avenue and 34th Street can see that there are a lot of other people in the area. But how many? The answer is important to retailers, who look at pedestrian traffic and see potential shoppers.
To measure the crowds, officials of the Grand Central and 34th Street Business Improvement Districts sent staff members to 14 major intersections to count the number of people passing by at different times of the day. What they found was a wide variation in the volume of pedestrian traffic, even in locations that are close together. 
 For example, during the morning rush hour in April, an average of 2,406 people walked along the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and 34th Street. During the same period, an average of 9,834 people passed the northwest corner of the same intersection, most likely because of the nearby exit from the Long Island Rail Road.
The evening rush was even more congested, with an average of 11,856 people streaming by the northwest corner of the intersection and 4,335 passing the southeast side.
The size of those crowds is good news not only for retailers but for real estate investors as well. Steven Roth, the chairman of the Vornado Corporation, cited streets "teeming with people day and night" as the reason why his company has bought more than $1 billion in office buildings, a hotel and retail properties along Seventh Avenue between 31st and 34th Streets. With Madison Square Garden in its midst, he said, Vornado hopes to develop the area into an urban version of a suburban entertainment-retail shopping mall.
With its dense concentrations of relatively well-paid office workers, real estate executives said, Manhattan presents new opportunities for retailers who have developed their businesses in the suburbs.
Research has found that New Yorkers are walkers, willing to tramp longer distances than people in other central business districts to shop for what they want.
They are also far more likely to walk to any destination, be it work or shopping, than their counterparts in other parts of the country.
In some parts of Manhattan, like the heavily residential Murray Hill ZIP code, more people walk to work than arrive by subway, bus or taxi, according to the BID study. Accustomed to walking, they will go farther during lunch breaks to go shopping.
N. David Milder, the president of Danth Inc., a consulting concern that studies the relationship of pedestrian traffic to retailing decisions, wrote that "because of the amount of economic activity found in the midtown area, its geographic density and the propensity of New Yorkers to walk significant distances, one can reasonably expect that retailers in the Grand Central district can tap a much larger captive employee market than retailers in other downtowns or suburban locations."
Mr. Milder said studies had shown that office workers in New York, on average, were willing to walk 2,250 feet, or 0.43 miles, to do midday shopping, compared with under 1,000 feet in other cities. Discussions with researchers "produced a general consensus that people in Manhattan do walk twice as far as people in other downtowns and that this is probably because of midtown's huge range of retail choices and the large stretches of continuous retail space," he said.
The two BID's have been doing pedestrian counts since 1995, said Dan Pisark, director of retail improvement for the two business districts, which are centrally managed. "The retail companies are quite interested in them, and the store leasing industry is interested as a result."
Retailers want pedestrian counts, said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services, a retail brokerage concern, "especially in midtown where people are likely to shop in spurts, because that will help them plan their staffing levels."
But although the counts are a useful tool, said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, they do not show how much people are spending. "That's a question we get asked all the time," he said. "Retailers want to know what other people's sales volumes are and who else is there."
Even with their limitations, pedestrian counts are popular with retail brokers and store operators, Mr. Pisark of the business districts said. The counters, he said, chronicle the passing throng in the morning from 7:45 A.M. to 9:15 A.M., at midday from noon to 1:30 P.M. and in the evening from 5 P.M. to 6:30 P.M. They also record the peak traffic at each site, regardless of the time.
The counts are conducted during what are considered normal operating times in the city, like April and October, when the streets are least likely to be thronged by visitors and tourists. "We never count during Thanksgiving or Christmas," he said. "It's too crowded then; a counter could not stand at a place like 42d Street and Vanderbilt Avenue."
With rush-hour counts of more than 7,000 people an hour at that location, Mr. Milder of Danth Inc. concluded that more than two million people a year pass by that corner during the one-hour evening rush.

The Grand Central and 34th Street Business Improvement Districts conducted a pedestrian traffic survey to help retailers determine the number of potential shoppers passing by. Graph shows average number of pedestrians per hour during morning (7:45 - 9:15), midday (12:00 - 1:30), evening (5:00 - 6:30), and peak (highest traffic volume reorded at site) hours at various area merchants. Data are for each site visited on two separate weekdays (Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays) taken during April 1998.

HEADLINE: Making Threats and Losing Cash in G.M. Strike

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., July 7

 BODY:
A monthlong strike by the United Automobile Workers against the General Motors Corporation is starting to drain the cash reserves of both sides and is prompting G.M. in particular to begin reviewing ways to save money.
G.M. and the U.A.W. both have enormous financial strength, and neither needs to call a truce soon for lack of money. But the erosion of G.M.'s market share as the company's dealers run out of cars and light trucks poses a more serious risk to the company and its employees. Some lost customers may defect to rival auto makers and never come back, G.M. executives warn, and some U.A.W. officials privately acknowledge. 
 Today's negotiations continued far into the night for the first time since the beginning of the dispute, which started with a quarrel over whether workers at a parts factory were collecting a full day's pay for four to six hours of work and over whether G.M. had broken a promise to invest more money here. The dispute has led to walkouts at two parts plants here.
 Talks broke up at the plants late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday.
G.M. has raised the stakes by threatening to close some of its car factories permanently to become more competitive. The U.A.W. has responded by threatening further strikes this autumn at important parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, and Indianapolis, where workers also want G.M. to increase investment.
Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W.'s vice president for G.M. issues, said that the union would like to settle outstanding issues at the Dayton and Indianapolis factories as part of a deal here. But while both sides would like a deal by Thursday, which would allow a ratification vote over the weekend and a resumption of production on Monday, the growing number of disputes has made it harder to reach a deal.
A constant worry for the union is that if G.M. is pushed too far, it might simply sell Delphi Automotive Systems, its sprawling auto parts subsidiary. A new owner would be a tough bargaining opponent for the U.A.W., because the new owner would not have the numerous, high-cost assembly plants that make G.M. vulnerable to U.A.W. strikes.
Despite union objections, G.M. sold four parts factories in 1996 to Peregrine Inc., an auto parts company. Peregrine announced tonight that it would close two of the factories: one here in Flint and the other in Livonia, Mich. All 1,000 U.A.W. workers at the two closed factories will be allowed to transfer back to G.M. under a deal negotiated by the U.A.W. two years ago, but the closings confirmed some of the union's worst fears.
The company has already said that the strike cost it $1.18 billion in after-tax losses during the second quarter, but in recent days G.M. officials have been expressing more concern about the strike's effects on the company's $13.6 billion in cash reserves. The last big U.A.W. strike against G.M., a 17-day walkout in 1996, temporarily reduced the company's cash reserves by $2.3 billion, as the company continued to pay the salaries of white-collar employees and bills from outside suppliers of auto parts, but no longer took in money from selling new cars and light trucks to dealers.
The current strike has lasted 32 days, although the last 11 days have fallen during the company's annual two-week summer shutdown, when G.M. always experiences a temporary drain of cash. Donald Hackworth, G.M.'s group vice president for North American car operations, said today that the company was seeking to reduce the outflow of cash.
G.M. has already taken many steps to stanch the loss of cash. It has turned the power off at plants closed by the strike, a step that will add a day or two to the time needed to restart them later. G.M. has also reduced business travel, off-site meetings and the use of consultants.
But Wall Street analysts said that G.M. had enough cash for a prolonged confrontation. "It's going to take a very, very long time for G.M. to face any real liquidity concerns as a result of the strike," Scott Sprinzen, the chief auto credit analyst at Standard & Poor's, said. G.M. can easily borrow money or sell car loans to raise money, he said.
Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley, said that in addition to the $1.18 billion in lost profits, G.M.'s cash reserves had likely fallen by an additional $3 billion as bills came due for auto parts purchased before the strike. The impact on the cash reserves should now slow, he said, as G.M. stops further purchases of parts and because the company has laid off many workers.
The union is also finding the strike expensive, but, like the company, can afford to continue on its course. While union officials refuse to provide precise numbers, the strike appears to have taken about $10 million so far from a $725 million strike fund, which is one of the largest in organized labor.
The U.A.W. has been paying $150 a week in strike benefits to 9,200 striking workers here, and has been covering their health care costs since July 1, when G.M. stopped its medical coverage for them.
G.M. has filed petitions with state governments asking that they not pay unemployment benefits to nearly 120,000 U.A.W. workers that G.M. has laid off, because G.M. contends that they are indirectly involved in the strike through their union membership and therefore should be ineligible for unemployment compensation. G.M. filed similar petitions in 1996, and while most states rejected them, Texas agreed.
As a result, union officials said that they had already decided to pay $150 a week in strike benefits to 1,400 workers at a sport utility vehicle factory in Arlington, Tex.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Picks An Ally's Son As Director Of City Budget

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed Robert M. Harding as his budget director yesterday, choosing to fill a critical position with a lawyer with strong political skills but little experience in fiscal matters and who is the son of one of Mr. Giuliani's closest political allies.
Mr. Harding, who has served the last four years as the administration's chief lobbyist in Albany, succeeds Joseph J. Lhota, who was promoted last week to Deputy Mayor for Operations. Mr. Harding will direct a staff of about 350 and oversee the city's $34 billion budget. 
 Mr. Harding, 40, has little experience with municipal budgets compared with his predecessors, and his selection surprised many fiscal experts, government officials and government watchdog groups. Several critics dismissed the appointment as a payoff to Mr. Harding's father, Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader, who has supported and advised Mr. Giuliani since 1989.
The Mayor defended his decision as being based on pure merit, arguing that Mr. Harding possessed other strengths.
"We have a Mayor and a Deputy Mayor for Operations who have great detailed knowledge of the budget after five years in government," Mr. Giuliani said. "And frankly, we needed to add to the team someone who has a really sophisticated knowledge of government. I think it's the best balanced team you can put together."
Mr. Giuliani made the announcement at a news conference in City Hall, sharing the lectern with Mr. Harding. The room was filled with many of the Mayor's top aides and commissioners. Mr. Harding's wife and their two daughters sat near the stage, but his parents -- Raymond and Elizabeth Harding -- chose to sit in the back.
"Most of you know my mother, Liz, and next to her is her husband, Ray," the new budget director said as he pointed them out, clearly anticipating the inevitable questions about his appointment.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Harding talked little about the direction of the city's budget. But two props given to him made clear that he was expected to pursue the Republican Mayor's fiscal policies: a black binder with a single sheet of paper that read "Just say no," and an oversized pair of scissors that the Mayor handed him.
Mr. Harding takes over the city's budget in a period of unprecedented plenty -- fueled by Wall Street's boom, the city ended the fiscal year in June with a record surplus of at least $2 billion -- as well as unusual political hostility inside City Hall.
Negotiations over the city's budget for the new fiscal year collapsed this spring after Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council and a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, proposed a referendum that would ask city voters whether public funds should be used to help pay for a new Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's West Side. The move enraged the Mayor, who accused Mr. Vallone of raising the issue only to further his gubernatorial ambitions. Amid recriminations, the Council adopted its own budget over the Mayor's veto for the first time, and the battle is expected to go on over the next several months.
Mr. Giuliani praised Mr. Harding's knowledge of government and called him "one of the most talented people" he had worked with. But critics said that whatever Mr. Harding's skills, the overriding reason for his appointment was his father.
Gene M. Russianoff, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a good-government organization, said Mr. Giuliani, who has often accused former mayors of cronyism, was being hypocritical.
"This is a mayor who excoriated his predecessors for political patronage," Mr. Russianoff said, "and now he behaves the same way by putting his allies in top posts."
Mr. Harding had been director of New York City's Office of State Legislative Affairs since 1994. After getting his law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1982, he worked as counsel to Assemblyman William F. Passannante from 1983 to 1990. From 1991 to 1993, he was general counsel to the New York State Science and Technology Foundation, and in 1993, he was counsel to the New York State Facilities Development Corporation.
Yesterday's appointment came a few weeks after Mr. Giuliani promoted Russell Harding, 34, another son of the Liberal Party leader, to run the city's Housing Development Corporation, a public authority that issues bonds for housing projects. That selection also raised eyebrows because Russell Harding, a college dropout, had no experience in housing finance.
In recent years, Mr. Giuliani has faced criticism because Raymond Harding built a prosperous business lobbying city agencies controlled by the Mayor, though he held back from the practice last year.
Raymond Harding said his relationship with the Mayor was not a factor in his son's appointment.
"If anybody thinks Rudy Giuliani would turn over the management of a $34 billion budget for political considerations, they don't know Rudy Giuliani," he said.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Doing the Heavy Lifting for Labor Unions

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
IT'S not very surprising, in retrospect, that it was the hod carriers, the floor sweepers, the stackers of bricks and scaffolding who were at the heart of last week's unruly labor rally in midtown Manhattan.
There were plenty of skilled tradesmen blocking streets and stirring up the air to protest the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's use of a nonunion contractor, as any bruised police officer can attest, but the organizers, the ones who shoved and shouted the hardest, were laborers. 
 They are the ones most vulnerable to swings in the economy and the encroachment of nonunion contractors, the first to be laid off a job when a budget gets cut. Mike Hellstrom, stocky and loud and typical of a new defiance among young labor leaders, said it was no coincidence that his union was at the vortex of the rally, just as it has been trying for two years to energize the other building trades.
"A carpenter needs to be able to use a screw gun and read plans and make cuts with sheet rock knives," said Mr. Hellstrom, assistant organizing director of Local 79 of the Construction and Building Laborers Union and one of a handful of people who brought together 40,000 workers for the protest. "But anybody can be a laborer. Anybody. Anybody can stack brick and shovel mortar and sand and sweep brooms and run pumps and hump stuff around on a job site. So we're not going to be complacent like some of the others."
Mr. Hellstrom and his colleagues have brought what they call a "warrior mentality" to the 7,500 members of Local 79, making it one of the most visible unions in New York for the last two years. Having grown sick of the corruption that long plagued the Laborers, and wary of deals with politicians, the union has created a new arena on the streets outside nonunion job sites, holding mass lunchtime rallies where thousands of members blow pink plastic whistles and deliberately make annoyances of themselves.
Most prominently, the local borrowed an idea from some Chicago unions and bought a pair of 15-foot rat balloons for about $4,000 each. Mr. Hellstrom carries them around in the back of his pickup truck and happily inflates them at a moment's notice when a contractor uses nonunion labor on a building site. The rats attract cameras, the whistles attract passers-by, and the general effect brings a good deal of attention to contractors who often prefer to operate quietly.
"The idea is to create a commotion," said Mr. Hellstrom, 32, grinning at the thought of all the editorials that decried the lawlessness of the midtown rally. "The thing about in-your-face-type organizing and militancy is, you're definitely going to get your point across faster and you're going to be heard faster. Our issues have been ignored for a long time, so if shutting down the city streets got us the attention that we got over this cause, then so be it."
To some degree, it has worked. The union's organizing has brought 1,500 previously nonunionized demolition workers into the local, and the constant rallies persuaded a contractor at 80 John Street to sign with the union. The State Labor Department has begun investigating the practices of Roy Kay Inc., the nonunion contractor that was the target of the midtown rally, based on information provided by union officials.
The other building trades, which hung back from the Laborers' more aggressive tactics for years, are starting to join in.
Edward J. Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents 100,000 construction workers, said that Local 79 had done a "tremendous job" re-energizing the trades, and that Mr. Hellstrom was one of a new breed of aggressive young organizers turning up the heat. (But Local 79 backed Sal F. Albanese in the mayoral election, while Mr. Malloy endorsed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.)
Fred Kotler, who has taught Mr. Hellstrom in union organizing classes at the Construction Industry Program of Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations in Manhattan, said Mr. Hellstrom was one of the most instinctive organizers he had known. "He's tough and street smart, and he represents a new generation of people who are now in positions of union responsibility, infusing a lot of energy into the building trades," said Mr. Kotler, associate director of the program.
MR. HELLSTROM, the grandson of Swedish immigrants, dropped out of high school in the 11th grade to join the union, having been taken to the union hall by his father -- a laborer even now -- at age 16.
Like a lot of laborers, he became "addicted to the good money," as he put it, and never left, though he eventually got his equivalency diploma. He worked on scores of construction sites over the years, eventually becoming a labor foreman, and after the Federal Government cleaned up and reorganized the local in 1996, he moved into organizing.
He's not sure where the militant streak came from, although he suspects he picked it up reading about the early days of the labor movement in America and the writings of the organizer Saul Alinsky.
By now, he said, even his 3-year-old daughter, Stephanie, sings union chants around the two-bedroom apartment he and his wife Angela rent in Howard Beach, Queens, a few blocks from where he grew up. He hopes she doesn't grow up to be quite as rebellious as her dad.

HEADLINE: A Hamilton Monument? Not on the Merits

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Restore Hamilton to His Pedestal" (Op-Ed, July 3): Although a monument dedicated to Alexander Hamilton may be missing from the Mall in Washington, there is a statue of him standing proudly on a pedestal overlooking the Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson, N.J. 
 Hamilton envisioned an industrial enterprise along the Passaic River, with 247 mill wheels turning with the force of the Great Falls. He hoped that by producing its own cloth, the United States would become economically and politically independent of England.
