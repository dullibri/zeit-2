HEADLINE: What Was Said on President's Visit to Maine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"President Begins a Campaign to Avoid Losses for the Democratic Party in November" (news article, Sept. 6), your report on the President's Labor Day visit to Maine, contained factual errors. 
 You quote me as saying that under President Clinton's leadership economic growth has soared and more jobs have been generated than under "the two previous Republican Presidents put together."
But you left out an important part of my statement.
What I said (transcribed from a videotape of the event) was that under President Clinton's leadership more jobs have been created than "in the previous five years of Republican Presidents put together."
By omitting my reference to "the previous five years," you transformed a correct statement into one that is incorrect.
You also state that my remarks were "drafted by the White House." My remarks were extemporaneous. I had no text or notes. I did not discuss my remarks beforehand with anyone, inside or outside the White House.

HEADLINE: In Baptist Talk, Clinton Stresses Moral Themes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 9

 BODY:
President Clinton told black Baptists at a convention today that government alone could not halt the decline in social and moral standards. He said that far too many young women are having abortions, and that only caring adults can rescue inner-city children, adding that it was time for Americans to revive faith in themselves -- and in him as well.
The remarks, in part a reprise of speeches about personal responsibility, sounded a familiar note that White House officials said was not intended to bolster the President's campaign-season credentials as a moderate Democratic leader. But, they said, he will probably repeat the theme through the November elections. 
 Mr. Clinton said, for instance, that black politicians should set aside their reservations about the crime legislation, which increases penalties that some black lawmakers have complained would fall most disproportionately heavily on blacks.
"Every time you look at the evening news," he said, "there's another funeral. And there's a disproportionate number of black kids lying in those pine boxes, too. And that's wrong, that's what's really wrong, and we have got to find a way -- imperfect though it is -- to get all the Americans together with all their different perspectives, and move forward on this issue because if people are not safe, we're in trouble."
The President's address at the annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., the world's largest organization of black Baptists, was billed as a lecture on the need for all Americans to play a role in repairing the nation's social fabric. And Mr. Clinton spoke long and passionately about what he said was every citizen's responsibility to ensure a safe and moral upbringing for all children.
The speech also sounded a lot like one on "family values" that Dan Quayle, a possible Republican candidate for President in 1996, delivered on Thursday in San Francisco. The White House said that was a coincidence, and Mr. Clinton's press spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said the President "agreed with many elements" of Mr. Quayle's speech.
Mr. Clinton began by discussing his own declining political fortunes, seeming to suggest that the recent drop in his public approval rating was tied not to his Administration's policies but to Americans' cynicism and fear of the future.
Citing a newspaper columnist who he said had written that "people are still mad at the President" despite relatively good times, Mr. Clinton said the problem was akin to that of a man whose riches had not made him content.
 
'Why Aren't We Happier?'
 "Well, that's kind of what's going on in our country today," he said. "We still haven't quite got the rhythm right, so that even though we are facing a lot of our most profound problems, and even though we are clearly making progress in areas too long ignored, which many of you have mentioned here, we have to say what is the real deal here? Why aren't we happier about it?"
The President suggested three reasons: public worries about the nation's future now that the cold war is over; an attitude "that seems to glorify the negative, the cynical," and an array of genuinely pressing problems, like crime, unemployment and broken homes.
Mr. Clinton said he still believed the Federal Government could resolve such problems, and he listed initiatives that he called evidence of his commitment, including the crime legislation recently enacted, tax breaks for inner-city businesses, changes in welfare, and greater spending on education and child health care.
 
Appeal to Blacks
 But his broader theme was that problems would never be solved unless ordinary people acknowledged their duty to find solutions on their own. And he made a particular appeal to his audience to help black Americans shed attitudes that he said hindered the search.
In unusually blunt language, Mr. Clinton urged blacks and whites to adopt a new and less tolerant attitude toward illegitimacy, abortion and single parenthood.
Noting that 4 in 10 children are born to unwed mothers, the President said Americans were "raising a whole generation of children who aren't sure they're the most important person in the world to anybody."
"That is a disaster," he said. "It is wrong. And someone has to say again: 'It is simply not right. You shouldn't have a baby before you're ready, and you shouldn't have a baby when you're not married. You just have to stop it.' We've got to turn it around."
The President was equally critical of the rate of abortions, which end 27 percent of all pregnancies. "I don't care what your position is, whether you're pro-choice or anti," he said. "That's too many."
Later, Mr. Clinton said the last thing he sought was to stigmatize children of unwed mothers. "I know not everybody's going to be in a stable, traditional family like you see on one of those 1950 sitcoms," he said. "But we'd be better off if more people were.
"I was raised by a wonderful mother who worked, who cared for me, who was a widow when I was born, went through a difficult marriage, and at least every now and then I find somebody that thinks I turned out all right."
Mr. Clinton struck many of the same chords as Mr. Quayle, who had accused the entertainment industry, politicians and the church of fostering an "ethical chaos" that is leaving children without any bedrock of moral values.
Without mentioning Mr. Quayle by name, the President said today that people should pay attention to anyone who preached against the decline in values, "whether they are our allies or our adversaries."

HEADLINE: CUBA VOWS TO END EXODUS IN RETURN FOR A RISE IN VISAS

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Cuba and the United States reached an agreement today under which Havana pledged to stop its citizens from fleeing the country for Florida aboard makeshift rafts and small boats. In return, Washington promised to accept at least 20,000 new Cuban immigrants each year.
But the 30,000 Cuban refugees who have already fled the island, most of whom are housed at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay or at camps in Panama, appear to be the big losers under the new agreement. American officials, briefing reporters on the results of the eight days of negotiation, indicated that the Cubans in Guantanamo and Panama would not be permitted to move ahead of applicants now in Cuba. 
 American officials said the United States would not accept them while they are in these camps and added that while they could stay there as long as they wished or seek asylum elsewhere, they must return to Cuba and apply for immigrant visas in the normal way if they wish to come to the United States. Cuba has agreed to receive Cubans now in the so-called safe havens of Guantanamo and Panama.
Reflecting the poor state of relations between Cuba and the United States, the communique announcing the accord was drafted in correct but chilly language. It said the two sides had "mutual interest in normalizing migration procedures and agreed to take measures to insure that migration between the two countries is safe, legal and orderly."
In the first step toward fulfilling the terms of the accord, Cuba announced this evening that it would stop further departures from mid-day Tuesday, even if force had to be used. The statement said Cubans had 72 hours from mid-day Saturday to clear up rafts or raft material gathered on beaches.
President Fidel Castro of Cuba has insisted that the cause of the sudden surge of boat people to the United States -- the largest since 1980 -- was the economic boycott of Cuba by the United States, and he wanted the talks in New York to cover the ending of the embargo. But American officials insisted that the talks be limited to migration, and it was uncertain what Mr. Castro had achieved.
In Washington, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff said the crisis was resolved because of "the quick and decisive action" of President Clinton, who made it clear that boat people would not be permitted to land in the United States, but rather would be sent to "safe havens." On overall Cuban-American relations, Mr. Tarnoff insisted that Cuba first had to make a transition to democracy.
"It will not hasten political and economic reform in Cuba for the United States to negotiate the terms and conditions of change in that country with its unelected Government, over the heads of the Cuban people," he said.
Nevertheless, this was the most significant accord between the two counties since the Carter Administration negotiated an anti-hijacking accord in the 1970's and agreed to set up quasi-embassies known as interest sections in Havana and Washington.
In addition to the 20,000 new immigrant visas it has agreed to grant each year, the Clinton Administration also expects to issue entry visas for 500 close relatives of Cubans already living in this country.
And as an exceptional one-year measure, the United States will grant entry to all Cubans living in Cuba who are now on the visa waiting list. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael M. Skol, who led the American negotiating team, said some 19,000 Cubans were on this list, although he expects only 4,000 to 6,000 of them to seek visas.
In total, Mr. Skol said that between 24,500 and 26,500 Cuban refugees were likely to gain entry to the United States over the coming year. Last year about 2,700 Cubans qualified as legal immigrants.
In a statement issued in New Orleans, Mr. Clinton said today's accord would "help insure that the massive flow of dangerous and illegal migration will be replaced by a safer, legal and more orderly process." The settlement, he added, was a "fair, good agreement, good for the United States."
At a news conference at the United States mission to the United Nations, where the accord was wrapped up today, Mr. Skol insisted that the United States had refused to even discuss the trade embargo against Cuba, let alone promise any easing of it.
But Cuba made clear at the start of the talks that it wanted the Administration to set a date for talks on easing the 32-year-old embargo in return for a new migration agreement, arguing that the hardship the blockade causes forces people to flee the country.
The text of the agreement makes no mention of economic issues, although the United States promised "to take effective measures" to stop aircraft or boat hijackings by Cubans fleeing their island.
Today's accord thus appears to give Mr. Castro very little since it fails to commit the Administration even to hold talks about the embargo, as Cuba wanted, or relax the additional restrictions Mr. Clinton imposed earlier this summer when he made it harder for Cuban Americans to visit the island or send money to relatives there.
"Castro miscalculated," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs. "He gets nothing out of this except an end to damaging publicity about the boat people. Since the Administration has not relaxed the new restrictions on remittances and charter flights, Castro's worse off."
Cuba committed itself "to take effective measures in every way it possibly can to prevent unsafe departures, using mainly persuasive methods," the agreement states.
"We expect a dramatic reduction in departures" Mr. Skol said, adding that the Administration also expected Cuba "to take humane measures to stop the outflow."
The round of Cuban-American migration talks that ended today is the 13th the two sides have held since they signed their 1984 immigration pact, under which the United States agreed to take up to 20,000 immigrants annually, although in practice it has tended to admit far fewer.
 
Ceiling Becomes Floor
 Under the new accord, this 20,000 ceiling on Cuban immigration in effect becomes a floor, although total immigration is still capped at 27,845 by an immigration law restricting nationals of individual foreign countries to no more than 7 percent of all immigrant visas issued each year.
If fewer than 20,000 Cuban applicants qualify for immigrant visas in any one year because they lack relatives in America or needed skills, Attorney General Janet Reno has undertaken to use her emergency powers to admit enough to bring the total up to that figure.
In Washington, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner said at a news conference that about 5,000 of the planned intake of 20,000 this year were likely to be political refugees and 2,000 to 3,000 more their close dependents.
She predicted that the Administration would issue an additional 3,000 normal immigrant visas to qualifying Cubans. The Attorney General would then use her authority to admit a further 9,000 to 10,000.

HEADLINE: Baseball's Owners Reject Players' Bid To Tax Rich Clubs

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner, joined the negotiations on the 29th day of the players' strike yesterday, and joined his bargaining team in rejecting the players' proposed plan for taxing clubs' revenues and payrolls. The move seemed to dampen the chances for a quick agreement in the dispute that has shut down baseball since Aug. 11.
But Mr. Selig did not call off the rest of the season on the day he had set as a deadline for doing so. And he did meet secretly with the players' labor leader, prompting speculation that the two sides could yet reach a season-saving settlement. 
 Mr. Selig's secret session with Donald Fehr, the union chief, was one of the signs that participants in the talks pointed to as examples that maybe, just maybe, something is coming that could produce an agreement.
"What they haven't done is say they're going home," Mr. Fehr said after the brief meeting with Mr. Selig. "They're not ready to write the season off yet. That's encouraging."
It was positive, too, that members of the negotiating teams scheduled two parallel meetings for today, one on the core economic issues and one on all other elements of the expired collective bargaining agreement.
And last night Mr. Fehr's brother, Steve, a lawyer who works for the union, spoke with Jerry McMorris the owner of the Colorado Rockies, whose behind-the-scenes efforts got the two sides talking.
The players' tax plan emerged from conversations union officials had had with Mr. McMorris.
The hopeful signs were not apparent in the public comments of Mr. Selig and Mr. Fehr. The owners rejected the players' concept for a tax on payrolls and revenues, which the union presented Thursday night in an effort to steer the owners away from their insistence on a salary cap, while still addressing their concerns over cost control.
In separate news conferences late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Selig and Mr. Fehr each railed at the other side.
But privately, the postures were different, and the public pronouncements didn't prevent Mr. Selig and Mr. Fehr from sneaking off to another room at the Hotel Inter-Continental after the news conferences for their secret session. Interestingly, Paul Molitor, a former longtime member of the Milwaukee Brewers, Mr. Selig's team, was among others who also attended the meeting. Mr. Selig is very fond of Mr. Molitor.
Union people, who have lengthy experience in baseball work stoppages, offered glimpses of what they thought they saw in the main bargaining session that lasted less than an hour.
One person said Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, gave his "stock salary-cap speech, but his heart didn't seem to be in it."
 
'I Like Your Plan'
 John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, another said, commented to someone in the union, "I like your plan, but we're not yet there."
Others said there were subtle suggestions from management representatives that the union shouldn't get excited about what they might hear in the news conference. And, finally, a union lawyer said, "If it's as bad as it looks, why isn't he calling off the season?"
Mr. Selig, who did not return repeated telephone calls seeking the management view of these reports, had said a week earlier that yesterday would be the deadline by which the two sides would have to be in substantive negotiations or face losing the rest of the regular season and post-season. He said playing the World Series without a meaningful end of the season -- two weeks, at least -- would be a farce.
When Mr. Selig was asked about the deadline at his news conference yesterday, he said: "I've said all week long that common sense should prevail. We'll have no announcement on the season until very early next week."
Later, he explained: "I'm very patient, very cautious. You want to bend over backwards to try to do this thing in an orderly way. It's late on a Friday afternoon." Still later, he said he really wasn't pushing back the deadline.
 
No Talks Scheduled
 He also said no talks were scheduled this weekend, then went off and met with Mr. Fehr.
"That's where the real negotiations are going to take place -- in a small room, not in a big room," said Brett Butler of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was not talking specifically of the secret session taking place at that moment, but of his negotiating experiences in general.
"It seems like we go through this posturing every time and things are said," Mr. Butler added. "But things happen in a small room. I wouldn't be surprised if something can't be done. With Bud Selig being here, there's a possibility."
Even so, in their public comments, Mr. Selig and Mr. Ravitch dismissed the union's concept that would transfer about $50 million from higher-revenue clubs to lower-revenue clubs. The union offered its plan as an alternative to the owners' proposal for putting a cap on players' salaries, which they say they need to hold down spiraling costs and help low-revenue clubs compete. The players rejected the cap as a means of artificially holding down salaries.
 
'Unresponsive' Proposal
 "Unfortunately," Mr. Selig said, "in our judgment that proposal was unresponsive to the long-term interests of baseball and the concerns we have been asking the union for a long time to address."
Mr. Ravitch reiterated Mr. Selig's assessment, but embellished his criticism of the plan by saying it did not deal with "the question of players' salaries, the relationship between players' salaries and industry revenue" and did not put a "restraint on the growth of player salaries."
The players' concept is three-pronged. It calls for an increase in division of gate receipts with visiting teams to 25 percent (from 20 percent in the American League and 43 cents a ticket, or less than 5 percent, in the National); a tax on the payrolls of the 16 teams with the highest payrolls, and a tax on the 16 teams with the highest revenues. Those wouldn't necessarily be the same 16 teams.
The union estimates that the change in gate-receipt sharing would produce $15 million to $20 million. To determine the rate of tax to assess payrolls and revenues, union officials worked backward from their desire to produce $10 million from the payroll levy and $20 million from the revenue levy.
They arrived at these taxes for last season and this season:
1993 -- 1.46 percent on payrolls, 1.58 percent on revenues.
1994 -- 1.51 percent on payrolls, 1.64 percent on revenues.
The money would go from the top 16 teams in each of those categories to the 10 clubs with the lowest revenues. Two clubs would remain neutral, neither paying the tax nor receiving money.
 
A Temporary Tax
 The union suggested that no team receive money for more than two successive seasons and that the tax system eventually be phased out. It suggested part of future expansion fees could take the place of the tax money.
"It should be temporary because the focus shouldn't be on sharing revenue but on working together to grow it," one union official said.
But the owners turned down the plan, saying they would decide how to share their revenue.
"It was clear a salary cap is still their primary consideration," Mr. Fehr said. "No salary cap in the plan, no artificial restraint to take player salaries below the market level, so they weren't interested. There's no clearer indication why there is a strike almost a month old. They're stuck on the same thing. It apparently doesn't matter what the nature of the proposal is unless it destroys the free-market system and holds down salaries."
Not all of the clubs were happy with the way their negotiators treated the players' plan.
"We have heard nothing from the people in New York," a high-ranking official of one club said. "I've talked to three clubs, and no one's seen anything. We're all trying to figure out what it's going to cost us. The only thing we have to go on is what we've seen in the newspapers."
Mr. Selig angrily said that all of the clubs had been informed. "They weren't informed earlier because we were running computer runs," he said.

HEADLINE: REPORT ON PRICES RENEWS CONCERNS OF MORE INFLATION

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Producer prices rose a surprising six-tenths of a percent in August, the biggest monthly rise in nearly four years. The spurt in prices fanned fears that inflation, which has been below 3 percent for three years, is speeding up.
The surge in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which measures price changes at the nation's farms and factories, made another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve more likely this fall. It also sent stock and bond prices tumbling. [Page 37.] And economists scurried back to their computers to take another look at their relatively sanguine inflation forecasts for next year. 
 To many business people, investors and analysts, the August rise looked as if it could be the first sign of the rising inflation that the Fed is trying so hard to avert. The August jump follows an increase of five-tenths of a percent in July and leaves the producer price index up at a compound annual rate of 2.9 percent through August, compared with 0.2 percent in the period a year earlier.
"I'm personally surprised that it's taken this long to show," said Brad Roller, president of Sweiger Coil Systems, a Cleveland manufacturer.
Yesterday's report from the Labor Department showed that the sharpest increases in the producer index were for energy and food. But prices for many other goods, from clothing to cars, also rose significantly. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices at the producer level rose four-tenths of a percent.
"The key question is whether such pricing pressures will continue," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "But, clearly, inflation risks are rising."
Despite the fact that inflation has been well behaved at the consumer level and virtually flat at the wholesale level for much of the year, the Fed has raised interest rates five times, citing concern that inflationary pressures would build up as the economic expansion rolled on.
But it can take six months to a year for interest rate increases to slow growth enough to restrain price increases. So inflation could rise in the months ahead until the full effects of the Fed's rate increases are felt.
But no one is talking about a return to the old days of high inflation. Many economists are expecting the pickup in consumer prices over the next year to push inflation to somewhere between 3 and 4 percent. The latest survey of the National Association of Business Economists sees a 3.5 percent inflation rate for next year.
The head of President Clinton's National Economic Council, Robert E. Rubin, said, "I think we're on track with the projections we've had," which show inflation of 3.2 percent next year.
"The economy is growing," he added. "It may be slowing down at bit. And there are efforts to get price increases, but for the most part they just aren't taking hold except at very moderate levels."
 
 
Confidence in the Fed
 One reason many analysts are confident that inflation is not taking off is that they believe the Federal Reserve will keep raising short-term interest rates until it is certain that inflation is in check.
After the Fed raised its target for short-term rates by half a point in August, to 4.75 percent, most analysts thought the central bank would wait until after the November elections before acting again, so it would have time to gauge the impact of its earlier moves on the economy and on inflation. Some analysts even thought that rate increase might be the Fed's last for some time.
But some analysts think the unexpectedly large jump in producer prices last month -- especially if it is clear that the increases are passed on to consumers -- will prompt the Fed to act when its policy-making group meets later this month. But most say they still think the Fed will wait until November or December.
Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers. The Producer Price Index would include, for instance, the price a paper company charges for the newsprint that it sells to a newspaper.
Some economists noted that some of the August price rises were clearly one-time events. Food prices rose seven-tenths of a percent, pushed up by a big jump in beef and fish prices. And gasoline prices jumped 6.8 percent after surging 8 percent in July. An upbeat crop outlook and softer crude oil prices suggest that these increases are unlikely to continue.
In addition, a speeding up in producer prices does not always translate into a speeding up of overall inflation, and besides, monthly price data are, by their nature, volatile. The August report on consumer prices is due out on Tuesday.
But few dismissed yesterday's report as a pure anomaly. The big rise in car prices paid by dealers, seven-tenths of a percent, seems to reflect strong sales and tight inventories. And the prices of many semi-finished goods that manufacturers buy, including metal parts, chemicals and fabrics, have been rising briskly for months.
That inflation pressures could be building does, in fact, seem surprising in some ways. Consider some of the standard indicators: hourly compensation for workers has been rising at the slowest rate in 13 years, barely over 3 percent in the last year. Meanwhile, despite a slip this spring, productivity -- the amount each worker produces in an hour -- was up a solid 2.6 percent from a year earlier. And an overhaul of the health care system, which most economists thought would add a few tenths to the inflation rate, does not seem likely to take place this year.
The two strongest reasons to worry that the August rise may be a prelude to inflation creeping higher are these: business and consumer expectations and the Fed's generosity earlier in the recovery.
Most economists now know that inflation is as much a matter of psychology -- and what investors, business people and workers think the monetary authorities will tolerate -- as it is a matter of fundamentals like factory capacity or the unemployment rate.
 
 
Businesses Are Raising Prices
 While there are still plenty of discounting and special incentives, there are signs that more and more businesses believe that they can make higher prices stick. Since May, for example, the National Association of Purchasing Management has been reporting that more than 70 percent of its members are raising prices.
Further, before its recent series of rate increases, the central bank pumped a lot of money into the economy for a very long time. For example, bank reserves, the raw material of the money supply, grew at double-digit annual rates from 1991 to 1993.

HEADLINE: Cuba's Hidden Gain

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Sept. 9

 BODY:
To judge from everything the Cuban Government has said in recent weeks, the agreement it signed with the United States today in New York to stop the flow of undocumented migrants cannot possibly work.
President Fidel Castro is obliged under the accord to try to keep his countrymen from fleeing by sea. But what he received in return -- mainly an assurance that at least 20,000 Cubans wishing to immigrate to the United States will be granted visas each year -- falls so far short of what Cuban officials say is needed to halt the flood as to raise questions about whether they have a vested interest in the deal's failure. 
 Throughout the negotiations, the United States refused to discuss what Cuba insists is the essential source of the migration problem: the embargo that the United States has kept on the island's economy for 32 years and toughened over the last 2.
Yet the talks themselves, and the exodus of migrants that prompted them, brought Havana a greater American hearing than it had received in years for its argument that the embargo is a counterproductive vestige of the cold war.
 
A Secret Promise?
 "Although the blockade continues and although a hostile policy toward us persists, the truth is that as of tonight, in one area, in one zone of the relationship between the two countries, we have achieved normalcy," Cuba's chief negotiator in the talks, Ricardo Alarcon said in an interview on Cuban state television. "It has been demonstrated that Cuba and the United States can reach agreement."
For the first time, the United States also formally committed itself under the agreement to "oppose and impede" the violent hijackings of planes and boats by Cubans fleeing the island. Coming after the Clinton Administration's reversal on Aug. 19 of the longstanding American policy of accepting all Cubans leaving the island, Mr. Alarcon said the measure represented confirmation of a "180-degree change" in a United States policy that encouraged illegal immigration in the past.
Still, so limited was Mr. Castro's apparent pay-off that some diplomats speculated that Cuba might have received a secret promise to discuss the embargo at a later point, perhaps after mid-term elections in the United States in November.
The State Department spokesman, Mike McCurry, said this afternoon in Washington that such talks would be conditioned on the emergence of "a pattern of political and economic reform" in Cuba.
That has long been the Clinton Administration's policy. But what such a pattern would look like has never been set out in any sort of definitive way. It could be that if Mr. Castro showed a new willingness to let Cuba's small and weak dissident movement organize and express itself more freely, the United States would find a reason to assess such moves generously.
 
Talks in Spain
 Some Cuban officials appear to believe that deep changes will have to be made simply to keep the economy from collapse. Diplomats also speculated that talks on Wednesday and Thursday in Spain between the Cuban Foreign Minister and mainstream, anti-Castro Cuban exiles from Miami could pave the way for meetings between Cuban officials and dissidents on the island.
Mr. Castro's consistent antipathy toward both capitalism and the dissidents leaves many experts on Cuba skeptical. But the flight of some 30,000 refugees from the island since last month and the events that prompted the Government to allow it -- the group hijackings of several state-owned boats and a riot against the security forces in Havana on Aug. 5 -- appears to have left more Cubans believing that change will have to come, one way or another.
Many analysts of Cuban politics have argued that Mr. Castro would be loathe to make significant political and economic changes at a time when they could be seen as concessions to an unyielding American policy.
Under the agreement, Cuba said it would do everything it can to stop illegal immigration to the United States but pledged to use primarily "persuasive methods."
Many diplomats and other observers voice skepticism that the Cuban Government will be able to stop the flow of refugees from the island without significant economic changes and perhaps political ones as well.
 
Scrutiny of U.S. Blockade
 Privately, several Cuban officials said they do not foresee great difficulty in reimposing police restrictions on people leaving the country by raft, so long as they are accompanied by a continued refusal by the Clinton Administration to accept the refugees in the United States. But if a heightened flow of refugees survives implementation of the New York accord, it could merely strengthen Mr. Castro's hand.
Even if they fail to convince the outside world that what they call the American "blockade" is driving the refugees, Cuban officials have already managed during the last month to force the United States to reconsider the policy in a way that it had not done since the Cold War ended.

HEADLINE: Israeli-P.L.O. Squabble Delays Aid for Arabs

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 9

 BODY:
A much anticipated meeting of donor countries that could have freed $160 million in aid to the Palestinians was canceled today after negotiators for the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel argued over the status of Jerusalem.
Announcing the cancellation, the World Bank, which had organized the meeting, expressed "deep disappointment at the way things have evolved." The donor countries were ready to disburse some of the $2.4 billion they had pledged to Palestinians for projects in the Gaza Strip and Jericho during the next five years. 
 Israel rejected proposals by the P.L.O. to finance institutions in mainly Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians have vowed to make their capital; Israel has always maintained that Jerusalem will remain united as its capital.
 
Money for Social Projects
 Israeli officials argued that financing institutions in East Jerusalem would circumvent an accord reached last year by the P.L.O. and Israel to negotiate the final status of the city only after self-rule had been introduced over a three-year period.
In a news conference at the World Bank headquarters in Paris, Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the P.L.O. had assigned only $4 million of the anticipated $160 million in aid to East Jerusalem, largely to maintain Palestinian social services.
"I can understand the Israeli position if we were putting army barracks or police stations in Jerusalem," Mr. Shaath said. "but we only wanted to repair schools and hospitals. Our minimum request is that Israel cannot practice a veto on that."
World Bank officials and representatives of many of the donor countries were baffled by the debacle. Israel and the Palestinians have been urging the international community for months to speed up disbursement of the $2.4 billion in pledged funds.
The United States, Japan, the 12-nation European Union and Norway are among the countries that have made pledges.
Mr. Shaath said that so far the P.L.O. had received less than $80 million in aid. It will be several more weeks before another meeting is convened by the World Bank.
 
Rebuke by the World Bank
 "If we are to move forward on the all-important economic agenda, we cannot allow such meetings that are expected to mobilize and coordinate aid to the Palestinians to be derailed by the two main parties bringing their political differences to the table," said the World Bank's vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, Caio Koch-Weser, in an unusually sharp statement.
The delay can only worsen the cash crisis faced by the P.L.O., which is already unable to cover running expenses like police salaries in Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinians have just negotiated an agreement with Israel to take on responsibility for the Palestinian schools and hospitals in the West Bank, which makes its immediate needs even more critical.
During the last three months, Jerusalem has often emerged as a point of contention, with the P.L.O. seeking to underline its influence over Palestinian institutions there and Israel emphasizing its domination of all areas of city management, including the mostly Arab eastern sector.
Mr. Arafat's concern was heightened by Israel's repeated invitations to King Hussein of Jordan to visit Jerusalem and its resistance to Mr. Arafat's efforts to get there before the king did.
It is not clear if or when the two parties will be able to solve their latest dispute and clear the way for a meeting of the donors. But Mr. Shaath insisted that despite the harmful delay, "we couldn't possibly have been seen as compromising our position on Jerusalem as a price for continuing the donor program."

HEADLINE: Beliefs;
An evangelical intellectual finds a kind of heresy in evangelicalism's neglect of the mind.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
Evangelical Christians in the United States have suffered their share of scandals. But perhaps the biggest scandal has nothing to do with Elmer Gantry-like antics, sexual or financial. It is what Mark A. Noll, a highly regarded historian of American religion and himself an evangelical Christian, calls "the scandal of the evangelical mind."
At least a fourth of the people in the United States classify themselves in surveys as evangelical Christians. The group is probably the largest, certainly the most religiously active and potentially the most politically powerful religious force in the nation. And yet, Professor Noll says, evangelicals have let their religious tradition sink into intellectual penury, largely bereft of the kind of vigorous intellectual life that would engage their faith with the whole array of modern learning and artistic expression. 
 In his new book, "The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind" (William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company), he writes that the scandal "is that there is not much of an evangelical mind." Evangelicals, he says, sponsor dozens of seminaries, scores of colleges and hundreds of radio and television outlets but have not one research university and nor one journal that deals with modern culture and current events on the level of The Atlantic or The New York Review of Books.
Mr. Noll, the McManis Professor of Christian Thought at the evangelical Wheaton College in Illinois, says in a preface to the book that he wrote as "a wounded lover." He describes himself "as one who is in love with the life of the mind but who has also been drawn to faith in Christ through the love of evangelical Protestants."
In fact, Professor Noll is something of a contradiction to his own thesis; he is part of an evangelical intellectual revival that has been quietly growing for several decades.
Last week, for example, when the American Political Science Association held its annual convention in New York, the discussion from the floor in both a session dealing with religion and politics and a session on religion and the news media was dominated by evangelical scholars. Indeed, much of the best empirical research on the intersection of religion and politics is being done by evangelical political scientists.
Evangelicals are now a strong presence in the field of Constitutional law and First Amendment studies. In important areas of philosophy today, there is "something of a Christian academic boom," Professor Noll notes, with evangelicals setting the agenda. Evangelical historians like himself are at the forefront of American religious history.
Yet exceptions like these only underline the evangelical absence from the front lines of intellectual life and the arts. Professor Noll says it need not be so. And as a historian he knows it was not always the case. Between the American Revolution and the Civil War, evangelicalism took to its heart many of the new nation's most advanced ideas.
It appropriated for its own purposes much of the Enlightenment's view of human nature, scientific knowledge and moral philosophy. It took advantage of separation of church and state. It embraced democracy and the open economy to create a broad synthesis of American and Christian values.
After the Civil War, the world changed while evangelicalism did not. The genius of evangelical culture was "affectional and organizational," Professor Noll writes. It harnessed new technologies to the service of its revivals, but it was intellectually unprepared for the challenges of secular science, Biblical criticism, social Darwinism and the new professional and monied elites who took over social leadership from the clergy.
The stage was set for what Professor Noll bluntly calls the "intellectual disaster of fundamentalism." Fundamentalism hardened evangelicalism's emphasis on the authority of the Bible into a strict theory of literal interpretation, a preoccupation with apocalyptic prophecies and a fierce concern with keeping true believers uncontaminated by others.
Although much of evangelical America is now "post-fundamentalist," he says, it suffers from lingering habits of anti-intellectualism and of using the Bible as a data bank of detailed information rather than for spiritual guidance and rejuvenation. Under fundamentalist midwifery, he writes, "the evangelical community gave birth to virtually no insights into how, under God, the natural world proceeded, how human societies worked, why human nature acted the way it did, or what constituted the blessings and perils of culture."
Professor Noll is saddened by the lack of influence in American life that this failure has meant, but his ultimate objection is theological and religious. He is quick to acknowledge that scholarship is not more important than sanctity, but he still argues that it is sinful, and a kind of heresy, for evangelical Christianity not to honor God's creation with study and contemplation.
The book is filled with appreciation for the strengths of evangelicalism -- its activism, its populism, its practical bent, its sense of spiritual urgency and its tenacity about its distinctive beliefs. But these virtues, Professor Noll writes, must be balanced with less black-and-white thinking, with more attention to the essentials common to Christians through the ages.
For non-evangelicals, the stakes may be different but they are not minor. Evangelical America has awakened from its long political slumber, as the religious right will not let anyone forget. The quality of public life -- society's capacity to engage highly combustible moral issues with any degree of nuance and reflectiveness -- will inevitably depend heavily on the intellectual resources that evangelical Christianity can bring to the discussion.

HEADLINE: Quiet Revolution in Latin Pensions

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
Faced with aging populations and bankrupt state pension systems, South America is undergoing a social security revolution as millions of workers open privately administered individual retirement accounts.
It is a revolution that bears economic and political consequences similar to the mass privatizations undertaken by Margaret Thatcher in Britain in the 1980's. In one generation, waves of workers from Bogota to Buenos Aires are being transformed from victims of state pension bureaucracies to active participants in national capital markets. 
 "We are turning all Bolivians into capitalists," Bolivia's President, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, says of his plan to distribute shares in privatized state companies to retirement accounts held by all adult Bolivians.
To judge by the experience of Chile, where the private pension system has been around longer than anywhere else in South America, workers are retiring with far more money than they did under the state-run system.
 
Private Funds Adopted
 Attracted by Chile's success, Argentina, Colombia and Peru have in the last year adopted private pension funds as equal alternatives to state systems. Bolivia's program is to start next year and Paraguay plans to follow suit soon.
Sensing opportunity, American life insurance companies and banks are moving to set up investment funds for pensioners in much of South America. Among American insurance companies, Metropolitan Life and New York Life have moved into Argentina; Aetna Life and Casualty is in Peru and Chile, and American International Group has started funds in Argentina, Chile and Peru.
American banks establishing South American pension funds include Bankers Trust in Chile, Bank of America in Peru, Bank of Boston in Argentina, and Citibank in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru.
In South American countries that have adopted the private system, workers may switch all their compulsory retirement wage deductions from the state system to an individual retirement account. They then control the investment of that money.
While formulas vary, the countries require a fairly conservative investment mix for the funds investing retirement money, weighting government bonds over common stocks, corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities. Investment overseas is limited to less than 5 percent.
With strict rules limiting commissions and operating fees, fund administrators in much of South America may not see a return on their investments for five years.
The private pension systems have emerged as South American countries abandon the "pay as you go" social security administrations copied in the 1940's from the United States. Using last month's contributions to pay this month's pensions, these systems have been undermined by aging populations. Intended to have as many as 10 workers support one retiree, the programs in Argentina, Brazil and Chile have only two workers supporting each beneficiary.
"The Brazilian pension system is collapsing because it was designed in the 1940's when the average Brazilian died at age 45," said Simon Schwartzman, a Brazilian demographer.
With their treasuries empty, most South American state systems pay pensions far below local poverty lines. By law, Argentina is to pay 82 percent of a worker's final wage as a pension. But in a nation where blue-collar pay averages $800 a month, Argentina's Government pays retirees an average of $180 a month and last year owed retirees $11 billion.
"Pension contributions will no longer be a tax, but a savings, and the only owner will be the worker," Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's Economy Minister, said last July in introducing the alternative private system.
Beyond freeing governments of burdens they are unable to shoulder, private pension funds give enormous stimulus to local capital markets and thus to economic growth.
 
Chile Sets the Example
 Planners look to Chile, which established its private pension funds system in 1981. Its pension funds now control $19 billion, half of the gross national product. "The Chilean system has principles that are applicable to the great majority of Latin American countries," said Julio Bustamante, state superintendent of Chile's private system.
With virtually all Chilean workers now contributing 10 percent of their monthly salaries to the system, private pension funds have almost doubled the nation's savings rate in a decade, to more than 20 percent of gross national product.
By heavily investing in mortgage-backed securities, pension funds have helped to finance a construction boom. Accounting for about one-third of holdings in Santiago's stock market, these institutional investors have fueled corporate growth and added stability to a once flighty exchange.
"This system is positive for the formation of capital markets because all retirement contributions that before went to cover fiscal holes now go to savings," said Raul Buonuomo, an economist for Baring Securities in Argentina. He estimated that by the end of the decade Argentina's private funds would be worth $30 billion, about 10 percent of Argentina's gross national product.
At the same time, Chilean account holders have benefited so handsomely that some may retire with pensions larger than their salaries. From 1981 through the end of August, private pension funds have provided an annual rate of return of 13.9 percent. The funds compete and account holders can switch among them at will.
"I think it is a system that is going to spread across all of Latin America," said Jose Pinera Echenique, a Harvard-trained economist who devised the program 15 years ago. He cautions, however, that a private pension system can work only with low inflation, healthy local capital markets, strict regulations and a well-trained, incorruptible monitor.
Venezuela, for example, would be far from meeting such conditions for a private pension fund system. With government oversight weak, its insurance industry is tottering and half of its banking sector has collapsed.
In Brazil, the enduring myth of an all-providing state has kept discussion of private pension funds out of the debate preceding the Oct. 3 presidential election. Private funds, all supplements to a universal state system, control about $6.4 billion.
And in Argentina, deep memories of stock market swindles and financial embezzlment kept workers wary when private pension funds were announced last May. After spending millions of dollars on promotion, the funds ended their first month with about 50,000 enrollments.
Movement has also been slow in Colombia, where the state-run social security administration has a relatively good reputation. Nevertheless, private fund directors predict that by the end of the decade they will be managing a $3 billion portfolio, held by 1.7 million Colombians.
In Peru, where about half of all insured workers are now with private plans, two small funds are merging with larger funds. In moves that have hurt all funds, some state companies have failed to pay workers' contributions to private funds and the Government has been slow to draw up regulations to allow funds to invest fully in stocks and mortgage securities.
Although almost half of Argentina's 5.5 million insured workers are now enrolled in private funds, fund mergers are expected, since the market is probably not large enough to support 24 funds.
In Bolivia, the big hurdle is President Sanchez's ambitious goal: the American-educated businessman wants to make Bolivia, South America's poorest country, its first with truly universal social security.
Over the next year he intends to privatize Bolivia's six largest state-owned companies, selling 50 percent of shares and management control to private investors, foreign or national. The companies include the national electricity company, oil company, telephone company and airline. Remaining shares will be divided among all Bolivians over 21 years of age -- about 3.2 million people.
Despite start-up challenges, no South American country shows any sign of going back to the past.
"The old social security schemes, many of which were instituted by former populist regimes, now appear terribly outdated and unsustainable -- if not outright bankrupt," a business monthly, U.S./Latin Trade, said last month. "Private pension funds, as Chile has discovered, are among the best options for Latin American governments trying to redress their social ills."

HEADLINE: Sister Parish, Grande Dame of American Interior Decorating, Is Dead at 84

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.
She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters. 
 Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.
The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America."
 
'Patrician Aplomb'
 John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."
With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."
She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.
In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive.
 
Still Working in Her 80's
 Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.
Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.
She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."
"The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting."
 
Father Collected Antiques
 Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.
Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.
As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.
She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand."
 
Decorating a Farmhouse
 After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.
Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."
It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.
The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."
 
'Money, Big Money'
 In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.
Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."
But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.
As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."
The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style.
 
Decorating for the Kennedys
 Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.
Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.
Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."
The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.
In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."
But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."
Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.
Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall As Inflation Fears Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For months now, anxious traders and investors have been flinching at every apparent sign of inflation and selling stocks and bonds, only to discover sheepishly that little inflation could be found.
But yesterday, they found clear and unambiguous evidence of inflation in the Government's Producer Price Index and rushed to sell. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 33.65 points, to 3,874.81, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.96 points, to 468.18. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 5.57 points, to 763.73.
Bond prices also nose-dived, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond soared to 7.70 percent from 7.56 percent. [Page 45.]
 
Bears Trample the Bourses
 European markets, girding themselves for the American inflation news, dropped even more than the eight-tenths of one percent decline in the Dow. German stocks fell 1 percent, in after-hours trading; British stocks fell 1.3 percent, and French stocks dropped 1.7 percent.
It was the announcement of a higher-than-expected increase in prices at the producer level that sent international markets skidding and sank the Dow so fast that the New York Stock Exchange invoked its "circuit breaker" rules to curb high-speed computer guided trading. The rules came into play at 2:22 P.M. after the Dow fell 50.13 points.
The August Producer Price Index rose six-tenths of 1 percent, the largest gain in almost four years, while the "core rate," which excludes food and energy costs, rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Along with the Consumer Price Index that will be released Tuesday, the Producer Price Index is one of the critical economic gauges that the Federal Reserve Board uses to guide monetary policy.
The Fed has raised short-term interest rates five times this year, and the stock market's rally in late August was based, in part, on a market consensus that the Fed would not raise rates again soon, perhaps not until after the November election.
Now, some traders speculate the Fed may raise rates as early as its meeting this month and could choose an increase of half a percentage point in its target for the short-term Federal funds rate, which is now 4.75 percent.
Yesterday's inflation numbers also mean that traders on Monday are likely to trim values on stocks and bonds further in expectation of an equally jarring Consumer Price Index on Tuesday.
"Tuesday's C.P.I. numbers will be the focal point," said Todd Clark, senior director of equity trading at Mabon Securities. "If producers are able to pass on higher prices to consumers, then you're really going to shake up the market."
Matthew F. Alexy, government trading strategist for CS First Boston, said: "What traders see in the numbers is that we've been dodging the bullet on the Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index for quite a while. Now the bullet is here."
 
A Worrisome Bond Market
 The bond market will be a special worry, said David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers, who last Wednesday cut his recommended allocation for stocks in investor portfolios to 45 percent from 50 percent. Because bond yields are so high, "stocks are going to get a lot of meaningful competition from bonds," Mr. Shulman said.
The stock market's rally in late August and sideways trading earlier this month have also confirmed some traders' belief that the August rises in the Dow and the S. &P. 500 were temporary -- a short-covering rally in the parlance of traders in which professional short-sellers were forced to buy stocks to stem their losses.
Short-sellers sell borrowed shares in the expectation that the price will fall and that they can repay the loan with shares purchased later for less than they sold the borrowed stock, pocketing the difference. But if the price rises, all bets are off. The investor must scramble to buy back an unexpectedly expensive share to prevent a large loss.
Utility stocks, which are especially vulnerable to inflation fears, were hard hit yesterday. Consolidated Edison, for example, dropped 1 1/2, to 23 3/4. The staff of the New York Public Service Commission also rejected Con Ed's request for a rate increase. Pacific Gas and Electric dropped 1 1/8, to 22 1/2.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above average with 294.3 million shares changing hands. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.44 points, to 258.38, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 584 to 1,635. The American Stock Exchange market value index was off 0.97 point, to 454.54.
Of the 30 component stocks of the Dow industrials, 22 fell, led by J. P. Morgan, the financial-services holding company, which fell 1 3/8, to 63 1/2. Financial services are also vulnerable to rising interest rates.
Of the 500 issues in the S. &P. 500, 396 fell, led by Philip Morris, which droppedl 1 3/8, to 59 7/8.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Broad Front After Producer Price Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell two pfennigs against the German mark and tumbled against other currencies yesterday after a sharp rise in producer prices sent bond prices plunging.
"The dollar got slaughtered," said Alfonso Alejo, senior proprietary trader at Sakura Bank Ltd. "People got scared because they see inflation eroding the value of U.S. assets." 
 Treasury bonds plummeted, pulling down the dollar and stocks, after the Government reported that the Producer Price Index rose a larger-than-expected six-tenths of 1 percent in August, the biggest increase in almost four years.
"For many players in the market, this is the worst possible development for the dollar," said Marc Chandler, director of research at Ezra Zask Associates, a Norfolk, Conn., hedge fund with $180 million under management.
Currency traders often watch the performance of the $3 trillion Treasury market to gauge foreign investors' appetite for American stocks and bonds and the dollars needed to buy them.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5368 marks, down from 1.5568 on Thursday. It also fell to 99.18 Japanese yen from 99.60.
Concerns about inflation also drove the dollar to a two-year low before it ended the day at 1.2811 Swiss francs, off from 1.3022 on Thursday.
The rise in producer prices increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates a sixth time this year in an effort to control any inflationary pressures, analysts said.
The selloff in the financial markets turned into a rout because the producer prices report fueled lingering concerns that the Fed had not raised interest rates fast enough to control inflation, traders said.
"People think the Fed is behind the curve on raising rates," said Marc Cohen, managing director at C-Wave Capital Management, a currency trading firm in Fort Lee, N.J.
Higher interest rates often buoy the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive to overseas investors. This year, though, higher rates have depressed bond prices, driving the dollar down.
The dollar's losses against the yen were limited yesterday because traders were waiting to see if negotiators made progress in talks aimed at opening Japanese markets to American goods. Many traders expect the dollar to rally if the two sides find a way to curb Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States.
The dollar also weakened against the British pound, which rose to $1.5530 from $1.5440.

HEADLINE: Manufacturer Of Rail Cars To Construct A New Plant

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
Dangling a $41.5 million contract for 34 new commuter trains for the Metro-North Railroad, New York State has lured a Canadian rail car manufacturer to build a new assembly plant in upstate New York.
The plant, officials said yesterday, will be located at the Plattsburgh Air Force Base, which is scheduled to close next year and has long been the economic heart of the relatively isolated area near the Canadian border. The closest major city is Montreal, which is 65 miles away. 
 The military base, one of four in New York State that are scheduled to be closed or cut back in the next year, at its recent peak employed 3,000 military personnel and 900 civilians. The base pumped almost $180 million last year into the local economy.
The new plant will employ at least 150 people, and could expand with additional orders to provide as many as 500 jobs.
"It's been a tough year," said Clyde Rabideau, the Mayor of Plattsburgh, a small city of 22,000. "But this is a big boost, not just economically but as a confidence builder for the future."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced yesterday that Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, one of Canada's largest manufacturers, would build the new plant.
Bombardier was the target of heavy attacks by Mr. Cuomo in 1982 when it received a big contract to build rail cars for Metro-North during his first campaign for Governor.
"When I became Governor, New York was importing all of its rail cars and buses," Mr. Cuomo said. "Now, almost 12 years later, we are the transit manufacturing center for North America."
New York, the largest user of commuter rail trains, transit cars and buses in the nation, has used contracts to lure several other manufacturers to locate in the state.
Today, three of the largest subway car makers in North America have factories in New York: ABB Traction in Elmira Heights, Morrison Knudsen in Hornell, and Kawasaki in Yonkers. In addition, Bus Industries of America has a plant near Utica and Transportation Manufacturing Corporation has a facility near Schenectady. Together, these firms employ more than 2,000 people.
 
The Promise
 In its campaign to win transit contracts in New York, Bombardier approached Governor Cuomo last fall with a promise to build a plant in the state.
"All their competitors are already here," said Mary Ann Crotty, the Governor's policy director. "They thought this would give them a leg up."
Bombardier will equip a former warehouse at the Air Force base to assemble the transit cars for Metro-North once the contract is approved by the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Bombardier expects to begin work even before the base is closed and is scheduled to deliver the first cars in March 1996.
"Establishing a plant in Plattsburgh enables us to get closer to the vast rail transit equipment markets of New York State and New York City," said Jean-Yves Leblanc, president of Bombardier's North American transportation equipment group.
For Metro-North, the new plant will also help broaden political support in the State Legislature for its spending program to improve transit operations.
Peter Stangl, chairman of the M.T.A., said, "This announcement demonstrates that the M.T.A.'s capital plan not only benefits millions of commuters each day in the metropolitan New York area, it also helps boost the economy in every region of the state."
In addition to Plattsburgh, the three other military bases in New York that are affected by the Pentagon cutbacks are Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, the Staten Island Naval Base and the Seneca Army Depot in Romulus. The state has established a task force to respond to the cuts.
Despite praise for the new plant, Mayor Rabideau couldn't help expressing nostalgia for the lost base.
"No matter how much money we bring in," he said, "it will never replace the heritage of the Plattsburgh Air Force Base."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Inflation Fears Push Gold To Highest Level in 2 Months

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
A surprisingly strong rise in the Producer Price Index pushed gold prices to their highest point in more than two months yesterday, as investors shifted money out of financial markets and into precious metals.
The rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in the August Producer Price Index, the biggest monthly advance in four years, caused turmoil in the currency, bond and stock markets, and attracted investor interest to the supposed safe haven of gold. 
 Gold for December delivery finished $1.20 higher at $395.80 an ounce, the contract's highest close at the Commodity Exchange in New York since June 24.
 
Lower Energy Prices
 But there was no strong rush to buy other commodities, and a weak gasoline market led energy prices lower. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose a slight 0.24 point, to 232.94.
The signs of inflation in wholesale prices -- which rose a significant five-tenths of 1 percent in July -- focused attention on the August consumer prices report, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday.
 "It's going to be a very important week," said James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc.
The resurgence of inflationary pressures in the last two months increases the chances that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again this fall to control any inflationary pressures.
Trading in the Comex silver pit was sluggish compared with that for gold. December silver rose 5 cents, to $5.565 an ounce. And October platinum gained $1.20, to $421.50 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Also on the New York Merc, gasoline prices declined, as the summer vacation driving season wound down. October unleaded gasoline fell 0.92 cent, to 47.47 cents a gallon.
Traders said several American refineries would be shutting down in coming months for maintenance, and crude oil supplies are expected to be replenished by ocean-going cargoes.
 
October Oil
 "Gasoline is going to help pull crude oil down," said Jim Ritterbusch of the Sweeney Oil Company in Chicago.
October oil declined 14 cents, to $17.53 a barrel. And October heating oil fell 0.26 cent, to 49.37 cents.
Elsewhere, coffee moved higher in a quiet trading session. December coffee gained 1.45 cents, to $2.17 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
"Nobody wants to sell it because of the weather," one trader said, referring to the lack of rain in drought-hit Brazil.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Brazil Stocks Fly High, But the Word Is Caution

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
FOR months, the Brazilian stock market has been serving up some of the sweetest returns in the world.
The Bovespa stock index at the Sao Paulo exchange has risen an eye-popping 90 percent in dollar terms this year, compared with the 1,325 percent in local currency caused by the country's hyperinflation. In the Lipper Analytical Services' survey of closed-end investment funds, the best performers through August were the Brazilian Equity Fund and the Brazil Fund, each up nearly 60 percent for the year. Now that the monthly inflation rate has dropped from more than 50 percent in June to about 5 percent, Brazil is even more enticing. 
 But money managers treat the country, the largest in Latin America and home to an economy the size of Russia's, like a beautifully wrapped present that on close inspection ticks ominously. Until the presidential elections are locked up in November and the leading candidate's currency stabilization program advances, caution is the byword, they say.
"Brazil is not for beginners," said Eduardo de Faria, the fund manager for the Brazilian Investment Company, in London.
If the country's program to stabilize the currency continues to work, research coverage of the more than 600 stocks on the Sao Paulo exchange will improve markedly and investor interest will probably soar. Institutions, wealthy investors and eventually individual investors of more modest means could profit as Brazil makes a long-anticipated conversion from an emerging market to a developed one.
A recent political imbroglio underscored just why professional investors remain wary. Brazil's economy minister, Rubens Ricupero, said that he had helped distort inflation figures to bolster the campaign of the pro-business presidential candidate, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Mr. Ricupero, chagrined to discover that his casual remarks had been broadcast through an open microphone, abruptly resigned.
Maria Elena Carrion, head of the Latin American equity team for the Bankers Trust Company in New York, said, "It just shows how something can come out of left field in Brazil." In June, she cut Brazilian exposure in the $200 million Latin American portfolio she manages to 20 percent from 30 percent.
Although lower inflation -- prompted by the July 1 exchange of the old hyperinflated cruzeiros for a new currency, the real -- is key to Brazil's future, the minister's statement and resignation roiled the Brazilian stock market only briefly and have done little to hurt Mr. Cardoso's presidential campaign. Most commentators have dismissed the minister's remarks, noting that inflation figures are compiled by independent agencies.
The market's volatility is another problem. Mr. de Faria, who manages $100 million, said: "How's this for volatile? January to February, up 63.1 percent; February to May, down 44 percent; and May to August, up 106 percent. "
And for investors with long memories, the promise of Brazil is a case of deja vu all over again. John R. Hickling, portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Fidelity Overseas Fund, has only 1 percent of his assets, or just $22 million, invested in Brazil. "My father grew up in Argentina," Mr. Hickling said. "People in Argentina say Brazil is the country of the future, and it will always be the country of the future."
For speculators and brave spirits, there are few opportunities to invest directly in Brazil. The only Brazilian stock easily acquired is Aracruz Celulose S.A., a paper processing company based in Rio de Janeiro, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depository receipts. The A.D.R.'s, which represent shares of the foreign company, have risen 57 percent this year to $13.875 yesterday, up 75 cents.
A few diversified Brazilian funds are easily accessible. The Brazilian Equity Fund, based in New York, returned 58.7 percent in the first eight months of the year, making it the leading closed-end fund, according to Lipper. The Brazil Fund, also based in New York, came in a close second, at 58.2 percent. Shares of both are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Although handsome, these companies' returns did not beat out the gain in the Bovespa stock index. So why don't money managers set up an 83-stock index fund that mirrors the Bovespa? Because more than 40 percent of the index reflects one stock, Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras S.A., or Telebras, the national telephone company. For better or worse, fund managers are paid to set up diversified stock portfolios for the long term.
The obvious choice for Americans are funds that invest throughout Latin America or even in emerging markets around the world. Most money managers follow a simple strategy in Brazil: buy blue-chips or economically sensitive stocks. Managers are buying Petroleo Brasileiro, a large oil company; Banco Itau, a big bank; and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, a mining and steel company.
Even skeptics say Brazil's economic picture may be clearer in just six months. Mr. Hickling, of the Fidelity fund, said, "If you could approach Brazil like a developed market, you could stock-pick your way through the country."

HEADLINE: Some Investments Tailored for Tuitions

 BODY:
Some investments are specifically tailored for parents saving for college.
The simplest is a United States series EE bond. Backed by the Government, these savings bonds are readily available from most banks and through many employee payroll savings plans at no charge. The interest on series EE bonds issued after 1989 is tax-free if it is used to pay for education and if the family's income is below a certain level. 
 For couples, the income limit for tax-free treatment is $68,250 a year, and for single parents, $45,500. Partial tax deductions are available until couples reach $98,250 in annual income and single parents hit $60,500. The downside? A low rate of return compared with investments with greater risk. The guaranteed minimum return is 4 percent, though the actual rate may be higher. The market rate through Oct. 31 is 4.7 percent.
Parents who want peace of mind that their investment will provide sufficient returns even if college costs spiral upward may be drawn to the College Sure certificate of deposit from the College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J. Returns on the deposits, which are insured up to $100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are intended to keep pace with college costs.
The yield fluctuates with the college inflation rate index published on July 31 each year by the College Board. A public college generally costs 40 percent of the College Board figure, while Ivy League schools cost 143 percent of that amount. On July 31, the index rose 5.4 percent, and the average yield on the bank's certificate was 4 to 4.5 percent. The minimum initial purchase is $1,000 and additions must be at least $250.
College Sure deposits maturing in up to 25 years are available, with a stiff penalty for early withdrawal. Interest, of course, is fully taxable.
 Parents who intend to send their children to state schools may be interested in prepayment plans. Begun by Michigan in 1988, these plans allow parents to pay for tuition in today's dollars and have been approved by legislatures in Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming. Each plan has a different structure and administration, and some have been suspended because of financial problems.
Florida's prepayment program is the one that other state plans are measured against. It has the most participants, at 250,000, and the most assets under management, at $680 million. More important, it has great flexibility, covering both community colleges and four-year institutions in the state. Payments can be made in a lump sum or installments. Best of all, contracts are backed by the state, and the interest accrued is not taxable.
Finally, parents may be able to use a college savings plan established by an employer. R. J. Reynolds, Citicorp and other big corporations offer such programs. Some even provide matching money.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Performance Is Defying Pat Explanations

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
It is difficult to find a theme that explains the behavior this year of the various stock fund categories. While rising interest rates and a weakening dollar account for some of the movements, they certainly do not explain all of them.
Technology funds, which focus mainly on stocks in small United States companies, have performed well. But aggressive growth funds, which also own small company stocks, have fared poorly. 
 Gold, traditionally considered an inflation hedge, has not been profitable this year. But utility and income funds, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, have predictably underperformed.
Investing in overseas markets has helped investors' returns, mostly because the decline of the dollar has made investments abroad more valuable.
Despite the market volatility, most investors have neither made nor lost money this year. The United States diversified stock fund average was up four-tenths of a percent through Sept. 3, and including international and sector funds, the average was up 1.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Samuel Ervin Hill, Conservationist, 81

 BODY:
Samuel Ervin Hill, a conservationist and retired labor arbitrator, died on Sunday at his home in Redding, Conn. He was 81.
The cause was cancer, his son William said. 
 Dr. Hill, who had a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University, was an economic planner in Federal agencies from 1941 to 1953 and a research associate in industrial relations at Princeton University in the later 1950's and early 1960's. Afterward, he was a self-employed labor arbitrator and owned an old, working farm in Redding.
In 1964, he became the first chairman of the Redding Conservation Commission, and conservation took up much of his time in his later years. He served on that panel most of the time until his death.
He did much to persuade Connecticut legislators to adopt regulations on the use of inland wetlands and was one of the regulations' drafters. He was also instrumental in bringing about the purchase by the Town of Redding of more than 1,000 acres, mostly woodlands and other scenic open space, which has kept those lands undeveloped.
Dr. Hill was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in 1935 from Ohio Wesleyan University, then his doctorate in 1940. He was a co-author of "Toward Fair Employment" (1964).
His marriage to Edith Foster ended in divorce.
He is survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Betty Anne Bell; a daughter, Susanna Hill of Redding; two sons, William and Robert, both of Redding, four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Cuba: Keep Talking

 BODY:
The immigration agreement reached yesterday between Washington and Havana is a good beginning. If humanely carried out it should bring immediate benefits, including a cooling down of anti-immigrant politics in Florida, fewer drownings of Cuban rafters at sea and faster reunifications of divided Cuban-American families.
But matters should not rest here. The Administration, having made its point by limiting this round of talks to immigration, should now find the courage to move on to expanded discussions on all the political and economic issues dividing the United States and its largest Caribbean neighbor. 
 Washington has now agreed to admit at least 20,000 Cubans a year "under existing authority," in exchange for Havana's taking "effective measures to prevent unsafe departures of Cuban citizens."
What this means on the American side is that Cubans eligible for admission through family ties to U.S. citizens and residents will be moved ahead of the waiting lists applicable to eligible immigrants from elsewhere. Such discrimination in favor of Cubans is acceptable only if it does not increase waiting times for others. The remaining Cuban slots will be filled by those with special skills, the politically persecuted and others, but not by those now being held at Guantanamo.
On the Cuban side, the agreement means that Havana will discourage unauthorized departures. How this is done is crucial, since the freedom to leave one's own country is an internationally recognized human right. At a minimum, Cuba must not resume jailing those who try to leave.
Cuba has already said that it wants to expand discussions with the U.S. to other issues. Obviously, Havana wants relief from the U.S. economic embargo. But it has also given tantalizing hints, including discussions with opposition activists this week in Madrid, that it is willing to talk about a political transition toward multi-party politics as well.
The Clinton Administration should seize the chance to explore these issues, even though that would infuriate the hard-line Miami emigres with whom the Administration has rashly allied itself. If Mr. Clinton can now break free of this sterile embrace, he will find bipartisan support among enlightened members of Congress. As well, he could find encouragement from a newly published report that during the Ford Administration Henry Kissinger sought, unsuccessfully, to move toward full diplomatic normalization with Cuba.
The U.S. has a clear interest in less tense, more pragmatic relations with Cuba. It also has an interest in promoting a nonviolent transition to democracy and greater respect for human rights. Those interests argue for building on this week's agreement with increased dialogue and new incentives for greater openness by the Castro regime.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Study Found Race Discrimination, Not Redlining

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Boston Federal Reserve Bank study on discrimination in mortgage lending is misrepresented in "Redlining Under Attack" (front page, Aug. 30). The study found discrimination in mortgage lending based on race, not on geography (redlining), as you assert. Indeed, in a follow-up effort using the study's data we found no redlining in Boston.
You imply that our findings are questionable because the study did not include all the relevant variables in the decision to grant a mortgage, was overinfluenced by two minority-owned institutions and was invalidated by the published analysis of David Horne of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In our view, all three observations are incorrect. 
 The Boston Fed collected and tested for all the variables that loan officers, underwriters and economists working for other regulators (including the F.D.I.C.) believed were important to the lending decision. Contrary to your assertion, we included variables measuring the applicant's ability to pay for closing costs: liquid assets and net wealth. We found these variables to have no effect on the findings of discrimination.
We eliminated the six major lenders to minorities, including minority-owned banks, from the analysis and still found racial bias.
The analysis by Mr. Horne did not, and could not, invalidate our results. It consisted solely of an examination of 95 of the 3,000 files in the Boston Fed study. Such analysis does not permit any meaningful conclusions to be drawn about the statistical results of our study.
Our study's results have been replicated by the Office of the Controller of the Currency and the Federal National Mortgage Association, and we are confident they are accurate.
It is important to separate the Boston Fed's findings from public policy prescriptions that appear to emanate from it. We try to help private-sector lending institutions address this issue within their own systems of credit quality control. We believe lending in low- and moderate-income areas can be profitable and safe for private-sector lenders.

HEADLINE: New Ethics in Mexico;
Move in Bank Scandal Shows Willingness To Attack Corruption, Yet Old Ways Persist

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 9

 BODY:
By seizing one of Mexico's most powerful financial groups and issuing an arrest warrant for its fugitive chairman, the Mexican Government this week sent a pair of powerful messages to United States businesses planning to cross the border.
The first concedes that the old system of influence and corruption, which marked Mexican business while the economy was largely closed to outsiders, still exists to some degree despite far-reaching economic modernization under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
 The second signals that the Mexican Government is willing to prosecute such illegal activities, even at the cost of losing business as well as prestige.
The scandal, caused by the collapse of what authorities say was an elaborate insider loan scheme at the Cremi-Union financial group headed by Carlos Cabal Peniche, 37, could end up touching all companies, domestic and foreign, that operate in Mexico. But its greatest impact may be felt by the dozens of United States banks, brokerage houses and other financial institutions that have applied to enter the Mexican market.
In the eyes of some businessmen, Mexico's most serious bank crisis in a decade could turn out to be an unexpected bonus for American financiers. With the years of experience they bring, American banks could be seen as far more secure operations than many Mexican institutions, especially smaller ones like Cremi-Union that are less well run.
Although Mexican Federal insurance guarantees that no depositors will lose money, the recent scandal may make people more willing to trust a big name like Chase Manhattan or J. P. Morgan, both of which are seeking to operate in Mexico, than one of the Mexican banks that have been privately operated since being privatized three or four years ago.
More than 100 foreign banks and financial institutions have applied to enter Mexico this year, the result of the North American Free Trade Agreement and changes in Mexican law. Until now, Citibank has been the only foreign banking institution allowed to operate openly in Mexico.
As with the savings-and-loan crisis in the United States, the exposure of banking irregularities in Mexico seems likely to change the way financial business is done in this country.
"If they don't strengthen their capacity to supervise, these things are going to happen again," said Isaac Cohen of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
Mexican Government officials have already acknowledged that regulations will have to get tougher.
 
How a Scheme Worked
 The Cabal case provides an uncensored insight into the way some business is done in Mexico today. The authorities say Mr. Cabal had his banks arrange loans to shell companies, which then illegally funneled the money -- as much as $700 million in all -- back to him. He used the funds to buy a number of companies, including Del Monte Fresh Produce of Florida.
A registration statement for Mr. Cabal's planned purchase of another Del Monte company, the canned food division in San Francisco, says that he was charged in a civil suit with conspiracy to defraud, involving the operations of a New York company called Eastbrook in the late 1980's. The sellers accepted his offer anyway, although Mr. Cabal's disappearance makes it unlikely that the deal will ever be completed.
A representative of a bank in the United States that has applied to operate in Mexico said he had been approached by Mr. Cabal earlier this year to arrange some kind of financing. After checking Mr. Cabal's background, the banker said he decided to have nothing to do with him.
"In Mexico, it's always easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys," the banker added. "What's hard is to prove it."
Mexican banking's problems can be traced in good part to political issues. With the exception of Citibank, the banks were nationalized in 1981, and during a decade of Government management, they fell far behind in the services and modernization offered by banks in other countries.
President Salinas began to sell them in 1991 as part of his administration's huge-scale program to get the Government out of private business and industry, and raise enough money to reduce Mexico's crippling foreign debt.
It now seems that the attempt to raise money through the privatizations led the Government to sell many properties to the highest bidder, regardless of any doubts about the buyer's character. Mr. Cabal was widely suspected of illicit activities when he purchased his first bank from the Government in 1991. Before then, he grew bananas and exported shrimp.
 
Coping With Embarrassment
 The bank takeover follows other financial embarrassments. A Mexico City leasing company was found last month to have fraudulently received loans from the national development bank. And another company, Sidek, reportedly tried to bribe the Government oil company Pemex with the equivalent of $26,000 in marked bills that was said to be part of a $30 million ransom paid for the release of a kidnapped banker in June.
The president of the Association of Mexican Banks, Roberto Hernandez, said recently that these problems could happen in any country. What was important, he said, was that Mexico's regulatory system caught them. "The system worked, and it worked well," he said. Mr. Hernandez dismissed the idea that foreign investors would shun Mexico because of what had happened.
Yet, for some American businessmen, the scandals represent far more than aggressive entrepreneurs who were outsmarted by Government regulators. "In ways, Mexico is like a frontier now," an American doing business here said. "Guys like Cabal are trying to make as much money as they can before they get caught."

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article in Business Day on Sept. 10, about the Mexican Government's response to a bank scandal, misstated the year Mexico's banks were nationalized. It was 1982, not 1981.

HEADLINE: The Discipline of Saving for College

BYLINE: By JOSHUA SHAPIRO 

 BODY:
When Kalman A. Chaney, author of "Paying for College," begins to brief parents, he urges them to take a deep breath and quips that he has a supply of smelling salts. A newborn today, he explains, will pay about $360,000 for a degree from an Ivy League college, $180,000 for a private college and $85,000 for a public university.
Once parents get over the shock, Mr. Chaney tells them to accept the uncertainties of interest rates, inflation, taxes and tuition costs and to establish a regular savings plan, no matter how small. To his mind, something saved is better than nothing, and with the power of compounding, the sooner parents start, the better. 
 Stuart Kessler of the accounting firm of Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Company in New York raises the issue of college planning with clients as soon as they inform him of a pregnancy. "Most parents talk seriously about saving for college," he said, "but they generally lack the money or the discipline."
 Indeed, a look at two families in sharply different financial situations shows that a reasonable strategy to pay for college can be created at various income levels and ages. As with investing of all stripes, saving for college means weighing investment risk against potential return. Then come the amount parents can contribute, the parents' and childrens' age, tax considerations and financial aid prospects.
Bob Grimes, a service manager for Eastman Kodak in Boston, has tackled the middle-class challenge of saving for college head-on. "Most people plan more for a two-week vacation than they do for their children's college education," he said. "They're just not thinking long term."
Mr. Grimes, 48, makes $50,000 a year and his wife, Patricia, 44, earns $6,000 from part-time work. They aim to cover half of their three childrens' college expenses.
Working with a financial planner, he divides savings into five portions and reviews his assets once a month using a Lotus spreadsheet on a personal computer. He keeps $10,000 in a savings account for living costs and emergencies. Top priority goes to his 401(k) retirement account, which gets 10 percent of his pretax income.
For his 18-year-old daughter, Susan, who is enrolling at Assumption College in Worcester, Mass., he has about $36,000 in certificates of deposit paying 5 percent a year to cover her college bills. Given that all of the money will be needed within four years, he does not want to take any investment risk. He began saving years ago for her education and expects to pay half of her $18,000 yearly bill for tuition, room and board. Susan will cover the other half with financial aid and loans, owing an estimated $36,000 when she graudates.
Mr. Grimes has amassed company stock worth about $30,000 for Robert, who is 15, by putting $10 a week in Kodak's employee stock purchase plan through automtic payroll deductions. Because the risk is great in having so much money in one stock, Mr. Grimes is slowly moving this money into a balanced mutual fund.
For Julie, his 9-year-old daughter, he began investing about $2,000 a year in several aggressive growth mutual funds from Putnam about three years ago. Given that college is several years off, he is taking greater risk in hopes of greater return.
For people who hope to qualify for some financial aid, keeping college funds in the parents' names generally makes the most sense, Mr. Chaney says. Even though taxes may be higher, student aid formulas generally require parents to contribute only 5.6 percent of their assets annually to their child's education, while students are expected to contribute 35 percent of their assets, even if held in trust. If the money is all in the child's name, financial aid may evaporate.
 To gauge whether a child will qualify for college aid, parents can consult high school counselors, aid experts, software and books. Even families with high incomes may qualify for some aid, albeit probably loans.
Parents far outside the boundaries for financial aid may want to shift money into their children's names for tax reasons. A child under 14 will be taxed at his own low rate on unearned income of up to $1,200 a year. Larger amounts are taxed at the parents' rate. Once the child is 14, all his income will be taxed at his own rate.
Giving money to children, of course, raises issues of control. A savings account in the child's name, often called a Uniform Gifts to Minors Account, can be handled by an adult guardian only until the owner turns 18 or 21 (varying by state).
People with a high net worth often prefer to use a trust, which allows them to dictate terms of distribution and shield the funds from any of their own debts. Income in the trust, however, may be taxed at a high rate.
 Formal trusts have been created by Ralph Earle, 37, and his wife, Jane Mendillo, 35, who have combined income of well over $200,000. He is a management consultant for Arthur D. Little and she manages part of Harvard University's endowment.
"Kids complicate our financial picture, and funding college is an incredible expense," Mr. Earle said, "but both of us have benefited from higher education, so we made saving for college the highest priority after paying the bills." They are setting aside $10,000 a year each for Elizabeth, 2, and Thomas, 3 months, with the objective of financing their children's education within about eight years.
 Ms. Mendillo directs their investments into mutual funds and looks closely at fund expenses. She likes Vanguard for its low management costs and Scudder for its low cost and international equity fund choices.
While her children are young, she will concentrate on high-growth equity funds. As they reach junior high school, she plans to shift into high-quality bond funds, aiming for growth of 9 to 10 percent a year.
For new grandparents, who find a layette ho-hum, Mr. Kessler suggests a trust. Any person can give someone $10,000 a year without incurring gift taxes. If grandparents contribute $20,000 a year, Mr. Kessler figures, college could be covered in the child's first three years of life.

HEADLINE: A Hoplophobe Among the Gunnies

BYLINE: By Philip Weiss; Philip Weiss is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Gun lovers call the military-style semiautomatic weapons that will be banned by the crime bill "ugly guns." That's because they lack the wood stocks and clean lines of such pretty guns as the Benelli semiautomatic shotgun with walnut stock that President Clinton used to get a duck last December. Ugly guns are usually made from polymers. They bristle with high-tech accessories -- mushroom-shaped pistol grips, ribbed shrouds on the barrel that keep your hand from getting burned. The surfaces are as dull as office furniture. "Plain Jane" is how one gun collector describes the look.
Joe Harriton is a member of the National Rifle Association and has a bunch of ugly guns at his firing range in the Poconos. Several weeks ago, he took me into the back of the range's gun shop to see a few. There was a Russian-designed AK-47 made in Yugoslavia. An Israeli Uzi with a folding stock. An AR-15, Colt's civilian version of the M-16. Another AR-15, this one in green and olive camouflage. And an Austrian Steyr AUG, a lightweight matte-green thing, bluntly streamlined, almost like a cartoon gun. All are among the so-called assault weapons covered by the crime bill, which made it through the Senate on Aug. 25 and is set to become law early this week. Senator Dianne Feinstein had singled out the AUG, for instance, as the "favorite of drive-by shooters because of its light weight and firepower." 
 "The idea of these being used in crimes is so fallacious," Harriton said. "If we ban things because they're ugly, half the people in the country would be thrown out."
While we were looking at the ugly guns, hefting them, trying to conceal them, talking about the ballistics, considering the idea of knocking off a 7-Eleven with one (which Harriton said would be nuts), an employee came in from the range with another ugly gun, a Chinese-made SKS. A cartridge had gotten jammed in it. Harriton swung the gun up on his workbench and used a screwdriver to free the cartridge.
It was time to shoot. Harriton, a chunky and gregarious 53-year-old, grabbed a couple of guns and we walked out through the shop. Political literature lay out on the shelves: N.R.A. membership forms, books about women and guns. One leaflet promoted an Aug. 14 rally in Washington by the Gun Owners of America against the crime bill. "Question. What do the following have in common? Clinton, Hitler, CBS, Metzenbaum, ABC, Goebbels, Schumer. . . ." the leaflet began. "The attack on the Constitution has nothing to do with crime, or health care, or safety, or the children. It is about an all-out attack on our freedom and rights."
The Paradise Shooting Center is set in a hollow amid the mountains, not far from the big resort hotels in Cresco, Pa. The range itself looks like several football fields chewed to bits by gunfire. On one side of us people were learning how to shoot skeet. On the other side was a long wooden firing range, a row of a dozen shooting cabinets with a handgun or rifle chained at each window. Tourists filled the booths, paying roughly 50 cents a pop. A range officer named Brian Coffey showed a woman how to place her thumbs on a .44 Magnum.
We had a bench to ourselves. "Blaming a gun for its misuse is animism," Harriton went on. "This is the modern witchcraft."
He reached for the Uzi. It was black and had the angular formal properties of a home improvement device -- a caulking gun, a roof rack. "This thing is a relatively low-powered weapon," he said. "You can tell people it's not that powerful, but till you get to show them it isn't, they won't believe you."
He began pushing cartridges into the magazine.
"Can I do that?" I asked.
"Push them straight down," he said, sliding me the magazine and a tray filled with cartridges. "That's it."
The 9-millimeter cartridges slid in against a spring with the finger pressure it takes to knead dough. From the nearby cabinets came the steady clatter of gunfire. When someone hit one of the red-metal targets that hang like Chiclets from rusted iron gates, it made a sharp clang like a boxing bell. I lifted the Uzi.
"Keep the gun braced in your shoulder," Harriton said. "That's where the security comes from, is the three-point brace."
THE NATIONAL RIFLE Association is a grass-roots organization. Its strength comes from people like Joe Harriton and gun clubs like the one at Paradise across the country. You don't have to go to Washington to hear the N.R.A. catechism; you can go to any hive of the people who call themselves shooters. They will tell you that gun control has never been effective, that Hitler's first step was gun control, that government has failed to go after the real problem: the criminal. They will explain that the Second Amendment has nothing to do with hunting, that it guarantees the freedom of a people from tyranny from within.
Especially in rural and western areas, the N.R.A. beliefs tap into deep traditions of self-reliance going back to frontier days. When a boy gets his first .22 rifle from his father, it is a highly ritualized crossing. Guns have a respected place. "My state has probably one of the highest gun ownership rates in the country," says Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. "We have virtually no gun control law, and we have the second-lowest crime rate in the country."
In nonurban communities like Leahy's, the N.R.A. philosophy is widely shared: even moderate gun controls represent a violation of an essential freedom. Before long, the reasoning goes, the gun grabbers will be coming for your .30-caliber Remington. At times that freedom seems almost bodily. "It's a birthright confirmed for us by the Constitution," says Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s executive vice president and highest-ranking officer. "It was ours the moment we were born beneath these heavens." By mobilizing its largely male and middle-class faithful -- and by donating millions of dollars to Congressional campaigns -- the N.R.A. for years was able to exercise veto power over gun control legislation. Since 1991, a militant contingent has led the N.R.A., bringing its membership to nearly 3.5 million, an all-time high.
"They are the most effective political contact organization I've seen," says Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico. "Their pressure is intense and unrelenting and they're one-issue voters." Political analysts say that crossing the N.R.A. in a gun-friendly district can cost a candidate anywhere from 3 to 8 percentage points.
The crime bill's tortuous passage through Congress demonstrated the N.R.A.'s continuing influence in Washington. Public opinion polls showed close to 80 percent support for the assault weapons ban, which would outlaw the sale or manufacture of 19 weapons, scores of knockoffs and magazines of over 10-round capacity. Still, a knot of legislators stalled the bill's progress for weeks. "On this issue, the Republicans are under the control of the National Rifle Association," said George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader. Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware said that the politics were simple: "Guns, guns, guns, guns."
But the organization's success in very nearly derailing the crime bill masks an underlying truth: the N.R.A. is losing political power. The popular understanding of the assault weapons ban as a blow against drive-by shootings and "grievance killers" caused the defections of several longtime N.R.A. supporters. "The N.R.A. has strongly endorsed my past two elections," Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said when the Senate first approved the ban. "I only wish I was running again this time, because they would not endorse me and I would take that as an issue that that organization has lost touch with America."
May's close vote in the House, 216-214, especially enraged the N.R.A. "Those are our guns you're trying to ban, big government," Tanya K. Metaksa, executive director of the N.R.A.'s Institute for Legislative Action and the N.R.A.'s second-most-powerful executive, told the organization's annual convention after the vote. "Those are our rights you trashed. We want them back and we will take them back!" Similar alarms were sounded in direct mail campaigns and on the Internet.
But in its broader appeals, the N.R.A. became surprisingly shy. Its ads against the crime bill did not mention gun ownership; they focused on pork in the bill and bore the logo of an N.R.A. division called Crimestrike. The organization's major public initiatives these days also avoid mentioning guns. They advocate prison-building programs and three-strikes-you're-out legislation. One program, Refuse to Be a Victim, aims to inform women of how to protect themselves against crime, with the "choice" of owning a gun merely No. 42 on a list that includes pepper spray and doorstops.
"They spent what we understand to be a half million dollars against us in our last race and there was little talk about guns," says Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat, through a spokesman. "Even though gun ownership is probably around 70 percent in my district, the N.R.A. knows that 70 or 80 percent of the people think that the Brady bill" -- which requires a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases -- "and the assault weapons ban are reasonable." The N.R.A.'s message was that Synar was wrong on "values" issues. "When Mike Synar voted for flag-burning," said one N.R.A. ad, "so did you."
Arguably, the country is now at a turning point on the gun issue, one that recalls the period in the 60's when two other private matters were transformed into public health issues: smoking and auto safety. Indeed, sponsors of the semiautomatics ban argued that gun injuries are costing the health care system $3 billion a year.
The crime bill, the N.R.A. charges, represents the first step down the slippery slope of a near-abolitionist agenda, and I think they may be right. Thirty years from now, who knows how much the landscape will have changed? Handguns might be banned altogether. Ammunition dealers might be required to number every bullet.
BUT SUCH POLITICAL REVERBERATIONS WERE less interesting to me than the gun issue's personal dimension, the fervor of the absolutist. "The citizens who share our passion reside in every state in the Union," Tanya Metaksa had told Congress during hearings in April, and when I met her a month later at the N.R.A.'s convention in Minneapolis, she used an expression I'd never heard to describe an old friend: "He's a gunny."
How did gunnies cling so ferociously to beliefs that even they understood were completely at odds with majority opinion? How deep were the springs of that passion?
I spent a lot of time at May's annual meeting listening to N.R.A. intellectuals rise on the floor to speak about those beliefs. They called for the impeachment of members of Congress who had voted for the gun ban. They argued that, historically, the difference between a citizen and a subject was the right to bear arms. It wasn't hard to stereotype the N.R.A. activist. They were self-sufficient people, many of them loners or backwoods dandies. They wore moleskin vests and carried knobby canes. Western ties. Waxed mustaches. "No More Gun Control. What Part of No Don't You Understand?" one button said. An N.R.A. board member from Alaska wore a thick beard, black cowboy boots and a three-piece pin-striped suit. He took careful notes on a tiny notebook with a pen made from a brass cartridge casing.
The convention's rhetoric was predictable -- if heated -- until one man approached a floor microphone with a "point of privilege." The "enemy" was at the very gates, he announced: "H.C.I. has organized a group of women in a protest outside! We need all women, and women only, to proceed outside to confront this." H.C.I. -- Sarah Brady's organization, Handgun Control Inc. -- is the N.R.A.'s deadly enemy.
About 20 women left the hall. The enemy was a line of five women in their 60's with placards. They looked dear. They wore lipstick and long skirts and rubber-soled shoes. Their placards spelled out "Grandmothers for Peace Support Gun Control" (H.C.I. had nothing to do with it) and compared the number of children's deaths from guns in 1993 in the United States (5,000) to Japan (60) and Great Britain (33). The 20 women from the hall swirled around the protesters. "Are you a socialist?" one cried. A man who had come outside gave the grandmothers the Nazi salute. One N.R.A. member, Karin Ostrand, a sixtyish teacher with short gray hair, held her face inches away from the face of a protester.
"That number is not correct," she said. "It's a lie, put out by the American Medical Association. What are you defining as a child?" (Nineteen and under, according to the demonstrators.)
For weeks after the convention, I could picture Ostrand leaning forward, her white T-shirt stretching tightly over her buxom, burly frame. "I <heart> Shooting," the T-shirt said.
I couldn't imagine a more alien sentiment. I'd shot only once or twice in my life. In the political landscape of gun control, I was part of the N.R.A.'s enemy: urban-suburban, non-gun-owning. Or, as gunnies on the Internet chat group rec.guns put it (according to David Brooks, a pro-gun-control lurker), I was "hoplophobic," afraid of guns. It seemed pointless to try and explore the mind of the N.R.A. without doing some shooting myself.
AT THE N.R.A. CONVENTION, Tanya Metaksa had told me to talk to a man named Bill Doughty about going shooting. Doughty is president of the N.R.A.'s New York affiliate, the New York Rifle and Pistol Association. I reached him by phone and he said he was amenable, but that we should meet first.
He invited me to a hearing that night in Bedford, in Westchester County, where the town board was considering a hoplophobic measure: an ordinance to bar outright the discharge of firearms. A few suburban families had grown alarmed over a neighbor who had a state permit to kill deer but was shooting too close to their homes. The town administration had pushed the measure with little feeling for the community's tradition of hunting and shooting.
Angry sportsmen crowded the middle-school auditorium. Almost all of them were men. The high point came when a skinny 11-year-old boy named Peter Aquilino went up to the microphone. He had to stand on the toes of his sneakers to reach it. "I want to become a future hunter -- I guess you guys just don't give a damn about that," he said throatily, and walked back to his seat. The place exploded with cheers. Ralph Angeline, a firearms instructor sitting in the front row, spoke next. "I hope I have the privilege of instructing you in the safe use of firearms one day," he said, making a pistol of his left hand and firing off a couple of shots in young Aquilino's direction.
Bill Doughty turned out to be a dark-haired and intense man of 55. He wore a gray suit with an N.R.A. pin on the lapel, a white shirt and a tie clip on his tie. He is vice president of a small computer company.
We met to talk a few days later. He picked me up at the Croton train station in a 1979 Mercedes with a faint mildew smell and drove me to a park on the Hudson River. At the park, he suggested we sit at a picnic table under a shelter so the birds wouldn't get us.
"I deal constantly in emotional issues, and we have to strip away the emotions," he said. "The perception of the general public is that crime is our No. 1 problem. Certainly it's a problem, but . . . unfortunately, in the politicians' haste to do something for the vast uninformed public, the easiest thing to say is 'Let's ban the guns.' We're saying, 'Hey, time out, folks.'
"If you look at this logically, you say to yourself first, what has changed? The basic firearm hasn't changed. Semiautomatic firearms, so-called assault weapons, basically haven't changed technologically in a hundred years. But this certain segment of society has changed. There have always been criminals and highwaymen. All of a sudden they've become more vicious, more random. That to me says, logically, we don't have a problem with the instrument, we have a social problem, something that's been many years -- if not a couple of generations -- in the creating."
I asked Doughty how he felt about the need to have metal detectors in schools. He nodded rapidly.
"I think metal detectors in schools and courtrooms make a lot of sense," he said. "First of all, in schools we don't need youth who are volatile by their nature confronting each other with lethal weapons. So I have no problem with metal detectors in schools. However, when people say there are too many guns around, I say there are not enough guns around. And I really mean that. If I were bent on robbing someone, the person I would like to rob is one who I thought had no abilty to protect himself."
He motioned toward the Metro-North commuter train line.
"A group of youths boarded a train in Yonkers earlier this year and robbed it, Jesse James-style. And the reason they were able to do this successfully is because it's a fair bet people on a commuter train are responsible, honest citizens; they don't break the law. And therefore, if they're coming from New York City" -- where handgun owner ship is particularly restricted -- "chances are they're not carrying any weapon. So there you have a trainful of sitting ducks. This is like putting a sign saying, 'Take me, I'm yours.' If everybody in New York City who was a responsible, qualified citizen were permitted to properly protect themselves, they might not be such easy targets for muggers."
"Like they were saying at the convention," I said, "that a well-armed society is a polite society."
"Exactly."
Doughty drove me back to the station and gave me a pile of what he called "propaganda" to look over. He said he'd see about a shooting date later.
ONE OF THE THINGS DOUGHTY LENT ME WAS A videotape, "The Myth of AK-47 Power," which made an argument for ugly guns. It was produced by the Gun Owners of America, another grass-roots wing of the gun lobby, and featured Neal Knox, a former Texas newspaperman and longtime N.R.A. board member. In the video, Knox wore a tweed shooting jacket and fired several guns to demonstrate their relative destructiveness. The AK-47, in the collective mind, at least, is synonymous with "assault weapon" (William Emanuel Tager used a Chinese-made copy of the AK-47 to kill a stagehand outside the "Today" show studio 11 days ago). But "The Myth of AK-47 Power" shows it to be actually less powerful than the .30-caliber hunting rifles and 12-gauge shotguns that the crime bill won't touch.
Knox fired his arsenal at round watermelons he balanced on a wooden stool. The AK-47 blast merely shattered the watermelon. Skull-sized fragments glopped fluid down over the stool. But the shotgun shell pulverized it. Red smithereens of watermelon bloodied the air. You got to see this over and over as the video replayed it, backward and in slow motion. It was eerily reminiscent of the Zapruder film.
I talked to Knox by phone and he said that shooting "is not an extension of the death wish or the power game or the penile implants -- none of that. It's fun." But the pornographic lushness of the video hinted at a primal gratification behind that fun. No wonder the N.R.A.'s campaign against the semiautomatics ban had steered away from discussing ballistics in favor of slamming midnight basketball.
The tape carried a stipulation warning the media not to use it to illustrate the destructive powers of the AK-47 alone: the comparison to hunting or shotgun loads had to be shown. The gun lobby has indeed become highly sensitive about its public image. In planning its August rally in Washington, the Gun Owners of America warned sportsmen to dress appropriately. "Nothing that can be used by the enemy or the media against us should be brought or displayed at the rally," it warned.
N.R.A. officials blame the "political classes" and the "media elite" for demonizing the organization. Much of the annual convention in Minneapolis was devoted to attacks on the press. "Our media has become the master over the very Constitution that created it," said Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A. leader. "Forget Stalin's Russia. Forget Hitler's Germany. The mightiest propaganda machine the world has ever known is right here in 1994 America." Even though Tanya Metaksa heads the N.R.A.'s political operations, she was slightly cruder. When one member questioned the effectiveness of the preprinted postcards that members were being urged to mail to TV anchors to protest anti-gun coverage, Metaksa shrugged. "Put it on a piece of toilet paper and send it in," she said. "Do it before the cost of postage goes up again."
Metaksa said she would take me shooting. The N.R.A. sent me three books on the basics of shooting, and then in July I went down to Fairfax, Va., to talk to her.
The N.R.A.'s headquarters is 10 miles outside the Beltway, in a six-story chevron-shaped building clad in metallic blue glass. "We stole that building," Knox said. It was all but in foreclosure, he explained, and was bought in March 1993 for $16.9 million, less than half its construction cost. Still, the N.R.A. is quite defensive about the purchase. The organization has been operating in the red for the last three years while seeking to revitalize its mission (Knox said reserves have dipped from about $90 million to half that sum). Besides, the N.R.A. still hasn't figured out what to do with its old headquarters on Scott Circle in downtown Washington.
In Fairfax, I was shown into a windowless conference room that felt gee-whiz, a little Big Brother by way of Virginia. One wall was filled with a couple of dozen television sets, all going, all mute, all on different channels.
Metaksa appeared in the doorway. She is an intimidating presence. Square-shouldered, large-breasted, handsome. She has a withering stare that she says comes from her late father, a Russian immigrant named Komisarjevsky. Metaksa, 57, seems like a character out of Ayn Rand. Later, in her office, I saw a dogeared copy of "Atlas Shrugged" in a bookcase.
Our conversation rapidly became disputatious, which didn't seem to bother Metaksa all that much.
"There is, I believe, a hidden agenda among what I call gun prohibitionists who want to disarm the American people, and they're selling the greater number of unknowing Americans that guns all by themselves are evil," she said. "What you have here is a firearm, which is protected under the Bill of Rights of this country, which is being attacked because people are being taught -- to go back to my favorite bogyman -- by the media."
I asked her about a comment she'd made to me in Minneapolis, that our Government behaved like the Gestapo when it overpowered the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex., last year.
She nodded but didn't look at me, staring over my shoulder at the TV screens. "What you have here is what you have in every situation," she said. "When government wants to press its case, and it owns the media, it can do a very good job of propagandizing." Hitler, Metaksa said, "owned the media. And Dr. Goebbels was very good at it, and he told everybody what they wanted to know. Now we have Holocaust memorials, but in the 1930's there were precious few that were standing up."
"But isn't the American public more enlightened? Don't they say, O.K., our government abused people's rights in Waco, but it's still a benign, benevolent government?"
"I don't think any government is terribly benign or benevolent as long as they have the power to do what they want. Benign by its definition means that you leave things alone. We've had the government jumping into houses because they got a tip from some lowlife and killing people and ruining their lives looking for drugs. Now I'm sorry, it's the wrong address. This is a benign government?"
"When you say the government owns the media, what do you mean?"
"I think the major television networks, the major newspapers, the major magazines are very supportive of this government's agenda."
"How would you characterize that agenda?"
"The agenda of this government is to increase the size of government and to put more and more of our lives under the control of government bureaucrats."
"But doesn't Waco show us that even if citizens arm themselves the government will always win?"
"Have you read history?" she said.
"What's your point?"
"Look at the history of the world." Just because a government, Metaksa said, "may have the bigger and the better and the fancier doesn't mean that when their freedom is threatened, that people don't go to absolutely heroic means -- including dying -- to make the point that they are going to be free. We just celebrated D-Day, but what really helped bring the Nazis to their knees were those freedom fighters all over France and in Holland and every place else in Europe, with their antiquated blunderbusses, picking off German occupying soldiers one at a time."
Metaksa excused herself for a few minutes and came back in with a Diet Dr Pepper and a tall, green glass. I tried arguing that her anti-media talk is a case of killing the messenger, that people really do believe that guns are too available.
"Twenty, 30 years of gun control laws haven't made guns less available," she said. "The only people they've made them less available to is all those people who were at the annual meeting."
"But isn't there a groundswell behind H.C.I.'s influence?"
"They became a business," she said.
"Sarah Brady's commitment on this issue seems pretty genuine."
Metaksa set her glass down. "She's making a lot of money."
"I assume you make a lot of money," I said. "At the annual meeting, you had critics on the floor who tried to make an issue of your computer businesses." (Metaksa is skilled in the use of computer bulletin boards. According to N.R.A. reports, her company received $192,000 from the N.R.A. in 1993 for computer services. And her salary is a reported $130,000 a year.)
"Go look at my house and go look at her house."
"But Sarah Brady's motivation is more complex than that."
"I'm not even going to start to talk about her motivation because I don't know it, so it's not something I should even discuss. I know she makes a lot of money, and more than I do."
Metaksa seemed cross. I moved her off the subject.
"I want to go shooting with you," I said.
She said fine, that she'd have to check with her husband.
IT TOOK A LITTLE PRODDING TO GET A shooting date. In the end, I bought a box of Winchester .223 ammo, the kind the Colt AR-15 fires. It's illegal to mail ammunition if you're not a dealer, so I dumped the shells out in a sneaker and sent the box to Metaksa. She called me the next day. "Got your ammo," she said. "Dinner date Thursday. Friday morning we go to the range."
While waiting for our date, I visited the N.R.A.'s former headquarters, an imposing affair with black granite sheathing and a portion of the Second Amendment ("The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed") chiseled into the facade. I could see broken-down desks through the glass doors of the deserted building. A Christmas wreath over the door withered in the Washington summer. It looked as though an army had retreated.
The N.R.A.'s recent reinvention as a militant and evangelical movement active on cable television and the Internet is the latest in a long series of transformations. The National Rifle Association of America started up in 1871 as a marksmanship training organization. For the next hundred years it found its mission in promoting the shooting sports. The cover of its monthly publication, The American Rifleman, dealt in sportsmen's themes. One Rifleman promotion, now famous among N.R.A. militants as a symbol of how lightweight the organization had become, showed one hunter goosing another.
The Rifleman figures in political history for another reason. In 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald ordered an Italian bolt-action carbine from an ad in the magazine, then used that gun to kill President Kennedy. Five years later, following the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., the Federal Government enacted the landmark Gun Control Act of 1968, barring mail-order sales of firearms and requiring gun dealers to keep records of all sales.
The N.R.A. supported that measure. But opposition to gun control sprang up across the country in pugnacious "sportsmen's alliances," which had surprising political power. They mobilized to help J. Glenn Beall Jr. defeat Senator Joseph Tydings of Maryland, an anti-gun incumbent, in 1970 and to stymie a handgun ban that Massachusetts was considering in 1976. The alliances then turned on the N.R.A. itself. In 1977, the N.R.A.'s complacent leadership was thinking about leaving Washington for an outdoorsy headquarters in Colorado that would serve as a sportsmen's paradise. At the annual meeting in Cincinnati that year, militant forces, led by Neal Knox, ambushed the old guard. The meeting went on into the next morning. The insurgents installed a new executive vice president and rededicated the organization to defense of the Second Amendment.
The N.R.A. became a formidable political power. It blocked almost all important gun control legislation and in 1986 succeeded in watering down the Gun Control Act by allowing the resumption of interstate sales of firearms. According to Common Cause, the N.R.A. was the ninth-largest contributor among PAC's in the 1992 Federal election cycle. "It's true grass-roots Jeffersonian democracy," says Pat Raffaniello, an aide to Representative Bill Brewster, an Oklahoma Democrat and N.R.A. board member.
Aggressive tactics are the lobby's hallmark. "Letters I get from doctors on the health care issue tend to be courtly," says Representative Andy Jacobs Jr., an Indiana Democrat. "These fellows, you get the impression that they might shoot you. They're absolutely truculent; there's no compromise."
Unwavering militancy began to isolate the N.R.A. from the political mainstream as early as 1982, when the organization, opposing the ban of armor-piercing bullets known as cop killers, parted company with police groups. The current battle over assault weapons echoes that unpopular battle and underlines a core philosophy within the N.R.A.: mistrust of authority. That mistrust is evident in the belief of many N.R.A. members that the Second Amendment exists for the broadest notion of self-defense -- from one's own government. The wildest cheers at this year's N.R.A. convention came when a tape was played of a young chiropractor and gun owner named Suzanne Gratia testifying before a House subcommittee. The Second Amendment, she said, "is about all of our right to be able to protect ourselves from all of you guys up there."
If that indeed is the thinking behind the amendment, as the N.R.A. might assert, why shouldn't the citizenry have the most modern militia-style weapons?
Supporters of the semi automatics ban cited what they called an overarching constitutional mandate: "to insure domestic tranquility," as Senator John Danforth, the Missouri Republican, put it last year. Especially for the suburban voters who represent the swing vote on gun control issues, militia-style weapons symbolize random killings and drug dealers doing business outside of schools. All three Republican members of Congress from Long Island voted for the semiautomatics ban, in some measure because their constituents were so aroused by the memory of Colin Ferguson stalking through a Long Island Rail Road train emptying 15-round clips. (Those clips will be illegal under the crime bill; Ferguson's Ruger 9-millimeter handgun, purchased in California after the required 15-day waiting period, would not.)
"There is a crisis in the cities," Representative Amo Houghton, a Republican from Corning, N.Y., who describes himself as a "proud" member of the N.R.A., said in support of the ban. "It is clear -- whether it is drugs, whether it is killings, whether it is unemployment -- these weapons have no place there."
The gun ban won other celebrated converts, notably Ronald Reagan (whose vocal support for the Brady bill helped it become law in 1993). Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, said that the ban was an "agonizing issue" for him politically, but he recognized that the healthy respect for guns he'd learned from his father had "faded" from too many American communities. As the crime bill neared passage, Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, used a speech on the House floor to resign his post as a board member of the N.R.A. "The only way they can lobby is through threats and intimidation," he said.
The political fault lines opening under the N.R.A.'s feet owe as much to long-term demographic changes as they do to the hot-button nature of the crime issue. Women in public office, for instance, tend to favor gun control. "There are fewer people in rural areas and more in urban-suburban ones," says Peter Fenn, a Democratic political consultant. "The average person does not see a threat to the right to keep and bear arms. You can get it if you need it."
In the half hour I spent at N.R.A. headquarters talking with Wayne LaPierre, a telegenic man with a slight twang, he seemed well aware of the need to reach out. "The N.R.A. didn't understand public relations very well," he said. "On cop-killer bullets, instead of responding aggressively, we let a distorted position get relayed to the American public." LaPierre keeps the conversation off guns, focusing instead on the N.R.A.'s efforts to fix the criminal justice system. "I'm so sick of us being portrayed as the bad guys," he said. "We are not the bad guys. N.R.A. cares."
But when LaPierre addresses his constituency, he preaches nonaccommodation on guns. "The Final War Has Begun" was the message he delivered in The Rifleman after the House passage of the weapons ban.
The setbacks in Congress have rallied the faithful with an us-against-them fervor. The N.R.A. claims that over 1,000 new members are signing on each day, at $35 a year per person. Gunnies have been rushing out to get ugly guns before the ban becomes law. One dealer told me the price of a Colt AR-15 had gone from under $700 to over $2,000 in less than a year.
SHOOTING WITH Tanya Metaksa was anticlimactic. We went to a scrubbed-up range near Manassas -- the Izaak Walton League of America -- and there were so many people around from N.R.A. public affairs that the experience became a media event, far removed from the rude pleasures of firing a gun. There was at least one true moment, when Tanya's husband was shooting a Chinese-made SKS, seized as a war trophy, and Tanya picked up the shell casings from the floor, dropping them in my hand to show me how hot they were.
By comparison, the dinner date the night before, at a Sichuan place near N.R.A. headquarters, was far less guarded.
When Metaksa picked me up at the Holiday Inn in her late-model black Ford Bronco, there were two other people in the car, a young couple named the Manowns. They were both shooters. Jim Manown was thin and clean-cut, with very erect posture. He is the system operator for Gun-Talk, the N.R.A.'s computer bulletin board. His wife, Jennifer Manown, had a slightly fey appearance, fine pale skin made paler by the faint pink boat-neck blouse she wore. Jennifer teaches art. At the restaurant, she passed around slides of her work.
A couple of other people from the N.R.A. showed up, along with Metaksa's husband. George Metaksa is an engineer. With his steel-rimmed glasses, white shirt and ungraying brown hair, he had an abstracted air. He sat on his wife's right but with an empty seat between them.
We talked about shooting. Thirty years ago, the Metaksas' new relationship had flourished with guns as a leitmotif. George had taken Tatiana out on her father's land in Connecticut to introduce her to guns. A few years later, he had pushed to get a baby sitter one night a week for their three daughters so that Tanya could get out of the house and participate with him in a Hartford pistol league.
The Manowns' young marriage was also cemented by shooting. Jim sounded the theme of the evening when he linked shooting with the libertarian spirit.
"Is the political power going to lie with the individual or are we going to cede our own political sovereignty to the government and turn what the founders said on its head?" he said. "That's the struggle. For me, shooting is also a struggle. It's to make myself a little better through hard work and effort, concentration and sacrifice. Because, ultimately, the only thing I have control over in my world is myself. I can't stop crime. I can't feed starving people. I can't take care of the problems in Bosnia. But I can make the world a better place by making myself better. And that internal struggle to make myself a better shooter is symbolic of that overall struggle."
The waiter brought out chicken with cashews, moo shu pork. He put dishes on a lazy susan in the middle of the table.
"That's really true for myself, too," Jennifer said. "Art is ambiguous." But, she said, with shooting, "it's, O.K., focus on the front sight, target should be fuzzy. When I do it right and it feels right and it goes where I want it to go, that's when I can say, Yes!" -- she made a little fist in the air and her face whitened -- "I did something right. The rest of my week is all maybes."
We put food on our plates and talked about the House's vote in May on the semiautomatic weapons ban.
"To me, that was the difference between freedom and no freedom," Tanya said. "We're trying to draw a line in the sand by telling the American people that if you trash the Second Amendment you're going to end up with a line in the sand that's way over here." She used her sea breeze cocktail to indicate a line in the air. "You're going to have no way of defending yourself against a government that truly gets out of hand."
I brought up Waco again and the fact that the American people seem to shrug off signs of brutish government force.
"Let me just explain," Jim said. "The primary reason there's been so little backlash against the Federal Government is the same reason that innocent Germans turned their back on the death camps. . . . People in black shirts who were under the orders of Janet Reno kicking that door in, dumping tons and tons of nerve gas and then watching -- I don't know who set the fire -- as 86 people burned to death. We can point fingers at the A.T.F., but we were the ones who did that ultimately. Our government is us."
The N.R.A. libertarian manifesto doesn't extend across the full spectrum of personal liberties. The organization has embraced conservative family-values appeals and attacked Time Warner for selling gangster rap. It has conducted "ethics" proceedings against former board members who publicly criticized N.R.A. business, and is petitioning the Federal Communications Commission not to renew WNBC's license, claiming the TV station has misrepresented the nature of semiautomatic weapons. Senator Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, an N.R.A. board member and one of Metaksa's closest allies on the Hill, has an approval rating of 5 (on a scale of 100) from the American Civil Liberties Union.
It was after 10. We drained the tea and I remembered the N.R.A. members who had risen on the convention floor to advocate legalization of drugs. The government, they said, had institutionalized the war on drugs as a means of violating individual rights. But the N.R.A. board had shut the discussion down. Bad publicity.
"How do you feel about legalizing drugs?" I now asked Tanya.
"I'm not going to do this on the record."
She drove me back to my hotel. Her members' current outrage over the semiautomatics ban, she said, reminded her of the 1970's, when she was swept into the movement that rose up against the Gun Control Act.
"But Tanya, do you feel any regret that Oswald was able to get that gun through The American Rifleman? That it's good for that kind of thing to be against the law now?"
She pulled the car under the portico of the Holiday Inn.
"I go back to the same argument," she said. "The person who wants to get a gun to commit a heinous crime, whether it's killing the President of the United States or your next-door neighbor, is going to get that gun or that weapon one way or the other and do the deed. Or at least try to do the deed. So if you make things illegal, he'll figure out another way of doing it."
BACK IN NEW YORK, Bill Doughty finally set up our shooting date. Wednesday morning, at 8, the Putnam County Fish and Game Association outside Carmel, N.Y. I got there first. Wooden signs by the trees pointed to the range. A rabbit ran up the drive and I sat on the big concrete stoop outside the clubhouse. There were ashtrays around me, one-gallon metal beer barrels painted red with the word "butts" painted in white.
I'd brought the 20 cartridges from the ammo box I sent Metaksa, heavy gleaming brass cylinders clenching pointy .223-caliber bullets. Touching them, the surreality of the experience began to work at me. We would be shooting enormously expensive ammunition designed to drop an assailant or kill a guerrilla fighter at 400 yards. But what would we be shooting it at? Paper targets, in a place designed to be incredibly safe. The N.R.A. people keep saying that a range is one of the safest places to be in society. Almost no one is ever hurt. At some level, the experience is inauthentic, play acting, just a couple of degrees removed from the kids who run down my street with toy guns, screaming "You're dead!"
Bill Doughty's old Mercedes came through the trees. He looked slightly Soldier of Fortune. He wore black jeans and boots and a black ammo belt with a fanny pack riding over it. We spent the first hour going over the parts of a gun, using the first rifle he ever owned, a .22-caliber Winchester 75. Then his friend showed up -- Scott Sommavilla, the political director of the Westchester County Firearm Owners Association, a 31-year-old Valhalla contractor and town constable with blond hair and wide-set blue eyes. Sommavilla had more "goodies," as Doughty put it, ugly guns in large hard-plastic cases that looked like they were carrying electric guitars.
The range was a hundred yards or so back through the woods, a wide concrete slab sheltered by a roof supported on 4-by-4's and painted red. The grass on the range was scruffy, tufted. Old wooden target frames listed in their mounts, pipes set into the ground. The atmosphere seemed as masculine as the clubhouse, crude.
Doughty struck a heavy brass bell seven times, warning anyone in the area who might be wandering through. "We've done our duty," he said soberly, and after that we shot for an hour and a half, slowly working our way up from the .22 to semiautomatic rifles that would be covered by the weapons ban.
The guns were heavy. They wearied my arms, and when I looked through the circular or notched sights, everything else dropped away. The solid kick goes out through your shoulder and back and it feels good. You don't know when the gun is going to go off. "It should always come as a surprise," Doughty explained to me. At his urging, I tried to establish a rhythm, squeezing the trigger slowly, applying more pressure as the target came closer, letting off as it drifted away. Hopefully, the gun explodes when the target is nearer alignment. It was almost orgasmic.
Our highest goal was to "tack drive," to put one .22 round in the same hole the previous .22 round had made in the paper target. Sommavilla and Doughty spoke a gun lingo I strained to understand: "ghost rings . . . belly bump . . . throat it . . . you're in the crotch . . . cheek it . . . it looks like a log in the cutter. . . ."
"You want to put this up? There's your peep," Sommavilla said to me, handing me a Ruger 10/22 semiautomatic.
I could rarely tell where my rounds ended up. It didn't seem like sport; it was so internalized, so cut off from the world. The ear protectors I wore only isolated me more. The awareness that I'd acquired the power to take human life confused my hoplophobia. I knew that I could turn the gun on everyone around me but that through some tacit, freshly negotiated social contract, we had all agreed not to do that. Issues of trust, individualism and community started to transform themselves. I understood what Jim Manown meant about personal sovereignty. Still, the gun seemed a crude means of arriving at that feeling. And besides, I wasn't ready to give up the social contract I'd already bought into, and so I actually felt freer when I put the gun down.
Ugly guns seemed to be Sommavilla's favorites. Military specifications, he said, made them durable enough to carry around outside when "varminting." He also shot them in competition. One gun dealer had told me that 30 percent of his ugly gun sales are to hunters or competition shooters. The rest are sold to collectors and shooters who prize the guns' similarity to military weapons. They are the state of the art.
Sommavilla opened a case and gently withdrew a black plastic gun: a Heckler & Koch SR-9 rifle, a .308-caliber ugly gun with a polygonal barrel and a pistol grip. The gun looked oddly toneless and austere. Sommavilla was proud of its price tag, upward of $2,800.
"The stock from this item here is a $400 item," he said. "The trigger, just the trigger, the piece that fits inside the rifle, is $200. So you're not seeing this show up on the street."
"How many guns do you own?" I said.
Sommavilla shrugged. "I think that's a no comment."
"These things accumulate over the years," Doughty said.
We were winding down. My arms were tired; my nerves a little frayed. I asked Doughty, optimally, how many people would be armed on, for instance, the Long island Rail Road train that Colin Ferguson shot up last December.
"I would venture to say that on a given trainful of people, it is likely that some measurable number of people, call it 10 percent, call it 20 percent, would so choose to carry," he said. "Even if there are only one or two of them in a situation like that, they could adequately deal with an individual like him."
But Doughty said that he differed from the N.R.A. in that he might require people to show evidence of some modicum of training. "Then if 90 percent of the people on the train are carrying, I say, 'Hey, I'm safe.' "
Sommavilla stood smoking a cigarette with one foot braced against a 4-by-4. Doughty brought me over to see his handguns. He showed me the pancake holster he uses for concealing a firearm in his pants.
"I believe when one is carrying a handgun concealed, that the best thing to avoid trouble is keep a low profile and not provoke anyone," he said. "No one even knows when I'm carrying a firearm. As a matter of fact, I've been carrying my .38 here all the time." He pulled the fanny pack around to the front and withdrew a handgun. "This is great for walking in the woods. Because if anyone disturbs you, they're in for a little bit of a surprise."
He dipped his hand into his jeans pocket for a velvety pouch, from which he slid a tiny five-shot .22-Magnum revolver. He could only hold it with two fingers. Still, it was just the thing if he was walking through the mall parking lot and sensed trouble.
"This is belly to belly," he said. "It's a last-ditch self-defense. If I want to, I can stick this in my watch pocket and slip my belt over it. My kids call this my nasal decongestant. This is absolutely secret stuff. If I find myself in a threatening position or perceive that the environment is such, I will quietly retrieve it from the case and I know that if I have to, I can deal with the situation."
All the high-minded notions about personal sovereignty had melted down into wired fear. Hoplophobics may be too trusting of their government. But gunnies, once you get past all their talk about birthrights and nerve gas, are plain paranoid.
Everyone was sweating. Doughty's red shirt had two circles of sweat right at diaphragm level. We packed up the guns and went out to our cars. A white-haired guy was coming up to the gate. He could have been walking down the boardwalk at Rockaway; he wore a T-shirt and trunks, sneakers without socks. He sat on a rock and chatted with us before heading over to the range. He and Doughty talked about buying their first guns.
I asked him what he was shooting and he slung a busted fake-leather bag around his shoulder and let me look in. There were two handguns inside, .22's, nestled in old cloths. It reminded me of my own secret adolescent rituals, getting Playboy magazines, one boy introducing another to the pleasures of masturbation. The bond with guns shared some of that same seediness.
A FEW DAYS LATER was when I drove out to the Paradise Shooting Center, Joe Harriton's place in the Poconos. The Pennsylvania affiliate of the N.R.A. had recommended it and Harriton had said something bracing on the phone, that he viewed guns as "entertainment."
Harriton turned out to be Barnumesque. He wore a body mike to address the crowd of vacationers at his split-rail fence, opening up with a stunt to show that the bullets they'd be using were real. He filled a gallon can with water and set it on a stump, then perched an empty can on top. When he turned and shot the water-filled can, the top can rocketed a hundred feet into the air, to applause.
On the range, the concrete floor was covered with spent shell casings. A 5-year-old boy bent to finger a hot one. Guns hung by chains to the cabinets; underneath, hand-lettered signs advertised the legend of each piece. "The .44 Magnum. Clint Eastwood made famous in 'Dirty Harry.' " "The .38 Special. For 125 Years an American Classic."
I shot smoking revolvers and a Chinese-made SKS whose wooden barrel-shroud was hot from the shooter before me. Later, Harriton took me out to a private area of the range and held up an Uzi.
"In Israel, if you're going into an area where you feel you may be in some danger, you go to a police department and say, 'May I have an Uzi, please?' And they don't give you this toy, which is no more effective than this pistol." Harriton touched the Glock at his hip. "They give you one with an extra selector switch for full automatic." (The sale of fully automatic machine guns in the United States was so sharply curtailed in 1934 that, by gunnies' lights, they were banned.)
"Joe, that's no toy," I said.
"No, it's no toy. But by comparison to a machine gun, it's so much less effective."
It was fun shooting with Harriton. With other gunnies, their concerns about projecting the right image tend to mask the power trip. Wayne LaPierre's "N.R.A. cares" agenda and Tanya Metaksa's libertarian patter seem like elaborate screens to divert attention from the core obsession that the people at Paradise wanted to share with me.
Harriton encouraged me to shoot the Uzi as much as I wanted. The gun made a good hollow punch in my shoulder, and when I missed the targets I saw bursts of dirt rise from the berm near the forest 300 feet away. I imagined how hard it would be to hit a person at that distance. I imagined myself running across the shot-up ground while customers let loose.
I filled the Uzi's 23-round magazine again and tried to keep the target fuzzy, as Bill Doughty had taught me. The gratification of shooting is private. Other people looked on but they couldn't share in it, couldn't even see what I was doing. It all happened in my head.
Gunnies traded stories of real encounters with enemies -- of people with blunderbusses subduing Nazis, of someone pulling a gun on you while you were taking a walk in the woods -- to give the fantasy greater verisimilitude. But they wanted to avoid the reality at all costs. A real encounter would be both uglier and richer than the fantasy. It was much easier to live in a never-bloodied belief about their powers and put off engagement. The gunny's dream about subduing endless enemies was like a pornographic illusion: your sexual powers caused scores of people to succumb to you at your will. No wonder the gunnies were so attached to ugly guns. Asking a gunny to go back to a less sophisticated firearm was like asking a devotee of pornography to go from videos back to still photographs: the level of actuality, the degree to which the thing simulates a primal experience, was greatly diminished.
Of course, it isn't a fantasy for everybody. The gunnies' obsession was so intense that they blinded themselves to the consequences of easy availability of guns in a crowded society: the single woman who feels the need to arm herself, the inner-city kids who want to bring a gun to junior high school. But here we were firing away in the safest place in the world.
"I believe that hit it," called out Brian Coffey, Joe's assistant, as I shot. "Took some paint off it."
Harriton slid the ammo tray across the table and I refilled the magazine. The .35 cartridges were like jewels, heavy and symmetrical, perfectly milled of expensive metals. The Astroturf on the shooting bench was so worn its black roots glistened in the sun.
I worked at the .44 Magnum and .45 service revolver, too. Harriton threw a one-gallon spaghetti sauce can out on the ground and said, "Quick, Phil!" I banged it up and cried out with each shot. The dirt jumped, Harriton shouted with laughter and the can danced and spun. It was only later, driving away, that I remembered the books I'd read about shooting. All those rifle and handgun chambers I'd blackened would need cleaning. Oh well, someone else would have to clean up after us.

HEADLINE: A Seaworthy Retreat

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE; BETSY WADE writes the Practical Traveler column.

 BODY:
DOORS have distinctive sounds. Long ago, I lived with a screen door in a beach house that swung shut with a twang, a thwack and a ting of the dangling hook. It imprinted itself on me as the heart of summer, distilling memories of ice cream, hammocks, breakers over the feet and a child padding into the kitchen in a sandy bathing suit.
Now, a year or so after a trip to the Rosario Resort in the San Juan Islands of Washington State, my memories focus on the door sounds at the Moran Mansion there: authoritative, heavy, tight clicks of solid mahogany doors built in the first decade of the century for maritime people who liked things seaworthy, even on bedrock. Cupboard doors in the mansion were so airtight their closing whoosh sent children's crayon works fluttering from the table to the floor. 
 We went to the Rosario resort, on East Sound, the fjord that nearly divides Orcas Island, for a long weekend last August. Getting there from New York was time-consuming, involving a flight to Seattle, a night in a motel, an hour-and-a-half trip in rented cars to the state ferry terminal in Anacortes, Wash., a ferry ride and then a half-hour drive from the landing on Orcas Island to the resort. The resort was right for our extended family group, exotic enough for the grandparent generation and with a wealth of recreation opportunities.
Management had its bad moments, particularly in getting people settled in and dispatching housekeeping help (the resort has since changed hands) and the guest rooms were ordinary. But the site at a junction of mountains, sea and sky was wonderful, as were its grounds and activities. The Moran Mansion was one of a kind, a historic curiosity that was worth the trip. The 54-room mansion houses the resort's health facilities, including two pools, and the dining rooms, bar, porches, sitting rooms and Music Room. Crave it as you might, though, the literature warns: "Guest rooms not available in the Moran Mansion." The 179 guest rooms are in 11 motel-style structures ranging up the hillside on the estate, some facing the water, some the grounds.
The memory of the Moran Mansion doors closing evenly on their special load-bearing hinges condensed into a Rosario essence for me. But I needed a reality test. I asked two granddaughters what they remembered best about the trip. I did not need to prompt. "The swimming pool with the pole!" they exulted.
Well, that's real. When mealtimes came at Rosario, the girls and their cousins had been in that pool so long that they were the texture of refrigerated prunes, bluish-white ones. The pool, one of four at the resort, was a 13-by-40-foot plunge that the founder, Robert Moran, built into the ground floor of his mansion. It occupies most of a tiled room, with an iron pipe running across the breadth of the pool a foot or two above the water surface. This looked like a tie rod to a New Yorker, the sort of thing that holds old buildings together, but the management says it is an old drain pipe.
When we first walked into this pool room, it was filled with the shrieks of bathing-suited children who were walking along the pole like a tightrope, maintaining their balance with hands along the ceiling. Of course, at some point they jumped into the pool with splashes that kept the lavish tiled floor awash. The grandchildren's eyes widened.
"Can we get in?" they shouted over the din. It looked intimidating, but those kids climbed trees and hung by their knees when they were tiny, and now they were 9 and 10, so I said O.K. In roughly 50 seconds, they were in their suits and into the water. In 51 seconds, Grandma the lifeguard was drenched, gave up and got in, too.
The suite we were assigned, No. 2003, was in a building near the top of the hill, nearest the two tennis courts. It had a back bedroom with small windows facing immediately into the hillside, making it dank and gloomy, and an always-bright living room with kitchen facilities and a scattering of implements, and a Murphy bed and sofa bed. This room overlooked the water through sliding doors to a balcony. In the morning, deer moved across the grass among the buildings and children popped out in nightclothes with apples and leftover bread as cameras buzzed like flies.
At the time of our visit, the rooms showed signs of neglect: The sliding screen door could not be operated, and the light bulbs were more suitable for meditation than reading. Nothing was actually dirty, but the motel-style furniture and carpets were worn, and trying to read in bed required moving around heavy lamps and tables. The bathroom was acceptable if not the latest word. Although the housekeeping staff was pleasant and willing, there seemed to be too few employees.
The former resident manager, Gary Vaughn, said in a recent interview that 100 of the rooms had been renovated over the last winter. Mr. Vaughn concurred that the furnishings that were there last year "left something to be desired," adding that renovations had waited until the summer rush ended. A new director of housekeeping arrived in February, he said, and some help was added and the system reorganized.
As of Aug. 23, the resort was under new ownership, having been sold to the same company that operates L'Auberge de Sedona in Sedona, Ariz. Dirk Oldenburg, the new general manager, said that the Orcas Dining Room would be redone by Thanksgiving, and a smaller, fancier dining room would be added by then, with all the guest rooms scheduled for renovation by next June.
Restaurant service was tops when we were there, and children got prompt attention, with special menus and information for dubious vegetarians about what was in various dishes. I was awed but still passed up the oyster frittata for breakfast, electing a homemade granola with fruit and yogurt. Most children went eagerly for the small order of pancakes.
The Friday night seafood buffet would put a cruise line to shame. Fortunately, we were seated in another room and had to walk to the buffet in the bigger Orcas Dining Room or we might all have succumbed on the spot. Rice and pasta dishes and salads made an ample dinner possible for those in our family who avoid red meat and shellfish.
Like many resorts, Rosario tends to overwhelm you with food. We ordered box lunches for our three-mile walk around Mountain Lake in adjacent Moran State Park. One box, with a sandwich, a quarter of a chicken, fruit, bread, cookies and a drink, would have served two easily.
In addition to hiking, sea kayaking and whale-watching were family members' outdoor choices. We tried the other pools: a large, unshaded outdoor one with a wide concrete apron, which reminded me of a economy-model municipal pool; an indoor whirlpool big enough for dog-paddling, and a small adults-only pool near the cocktail terrace, sheltered from the wind by a glass shield. The pool with the pole and its high windows became my favorite; its old-time design was a perfect vehicle for millionaire fantasies.
Eventually we all attended the popular daily slide lectures on the history of the Morans and the resort, complete with a recital on the organ of nearly 2,000 pipes. Like many set pieces, the lecture is designed with laugh lines: the vanity of Moran, who installed the giant player-piano organ in such a way that his guests could not tell he wasn't playing it himself. But the history is a classic: the rise and demise of a private empire on a peerless island.
The mansion was built as the start of a family compound by Moran, a millionaire shipbuilder who in 1875 had fled New York with the customary few dollars in his pocket. He had no connection with Moran Towing in New York; he built his fortune in the Moran Brothers' shipyard in Seattle.
In 1906, at the age of 49, having been told he had a bad heart and not long to live, he sold the company and retired to Orcas Island, the largest of the San Juans. The mansion is dated 1911 but the family evidently took up residence in 1909. Other buildings were added, including two beguiling Craftsman bungalow-style houses for Moran's brothers, built identical to halt rivalries. Moran called his compound Rosario, after the strait that separates the San Juan islands from the mainland.
As a group of more than 20 people, counting children, our family had use of a meeting area in the mansion, a pair of sitting rooms and a bathroom on the second floor next to the Music Room. These quarters gave me a chance to poke around and see how things worked. Like the door hinges with their lignum vitae cores, the windows -- unframed vertical glass panels 7/8-inch thick that pivot to open -- were created for the house. One room had a desk built into an alcove; the children caucused under it.
Other guests often poked their heads in; normally "our" rooms were among the three open for looking on the upper floors, in addition to the Music Room and organ balcony. The two-story Music Room, described as Moran's pride, was lavished with art glass, the organ and a library. As a main focus of the resort's history, it apparently has not been tinkered with at all, except for the addition of dark shades and a screen for the narrated show of Moran's own photos.
Other parts of the building have been modified to accommodate the restaurants and resort. But after I studied old postcards and a pictorial history, "Rosario Yesterdays" by Christopher M. Peacock, I began to discern the original outlines. Visiting with a niece over a drink in a glassed-in lounge, I suddenly understood we were under the arched ceiling of the old veranda and I should have been holding a straw hat and a croquet mallet instead of a glass of wine.
Even after he "retired" for health reasons, Moran kept on buying and building. Of 7,800 acres he acquired on the island, he eventually gave the state 3,000 as a start for Moran State Park, across from the entrance to the resort, which includes 2,405-foot Mount Constitution.
Moran, who despite the doctors' warnings lived until 1943, sold the estate in 1938, having outlived his wife and siblings and realizing that the children had no interest in it. After still another sale, 15 of the remaining acres were turned into a resort in 1960, with the mansion as the operating core.
The Moran Mansion, mercifully durable, is a periscope into another world. Like other vestiges of the age of robber barons -- Newport cottages or Rockefeller estates -- it would make a good house museum. Maintaining it as part of a resort, however, means visitors are able to touch things at will, lean out the windows, eat and drink there, and swim in Robert Moran's own pool, an experience more vivid than a walk through a museum.

HEADLINE: A First: Dual Gubernatorial Primary Fights

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

 BODY:
AFTER a summer when it barely attracted the interest of voters, the 1994 contest for governor will make history on Tuesday, as Republicans and Democrats decide each on a candidate Connecticut's first dual gubernatorial primary battle since the state authorized primaries nearly 40 years ago.
The primaries are aftershocks of Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s victory as an independent in 1990, which established a third major party, A Connecticut Party. Just as Mr. Weicker injected a new dimension of choice into the state's politics then, this year Republican and Democratic challengers fought off party leaders' efforts to decide nominations at convention, insisting that party members be given a direct voice. 
 As a result, a fuller spectrum of Connecticut politics will be put before the state's 704,000 Democrats and 478,000 Republicans on Tuesday. Democrats will be choosing between State Senator John B. Larson of East Hartford and State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr. Republicans will decide between John G. Rowland, the former Congressman from Waterbury who was the party's nominee in 1990, and the Secretary of the State, Pauline R. Kezer. While all four candidates promise to cut taxes and to get tough on criminals, their differences in style and substance amount to referendums on the direction each party should take. And with A Connecticut Party offering Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark as its candidate, voters are again given the choice of independence from both major parties. Also, former State Senator Tom Scott, who has crusaded against a state income tax, announced last week that he would be an independent candidate in November as well.
 
Other Contests
 The gubernatorial candidates, however, do not have the primary ballot to themselves. Republicans, choosing a candidate to oppose United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, in November, will decide between Dr. Gerald Labriola, a retired pediatrician and former candidate for Governor who won the convention's endorsement, and Dr. Joseph Bentivegna, an opthalmologist new to politics.
Democrats have a contest for Secretary of the State between State Representative Miles S. Rapaport of West Hartford, their convention-endorsed candidate, and Julie Tashjian, who held the office from 1983 to 1991. In the Fifth Congressional District, Democrats may choose between State Senator James H. Maloney of Danbury and State Representative Thomas S. Luby of Meriden to oppose the Republican incumbent, Representative Gary A. Franks of Waterbury. Mr. Maloney is the convention-endorsed candidate.
The polls will be open in every town and city from 6 A.M. to 8 P.M.
 
Challenge for Democrats
 For Democrats, who finished third in 1990 after holding the Governor's office for 32 of the previous 36 years, 1994 is a year to try to reassert the party's competence to lead the state. Mr. Larson, the convention winner, is offering himself as an updated traditional Democrat, skilled in the legislative process and confident that government works in the public's best interest.
President pro tem of the Senate for eight years, Mr. Larson was a legislative leader during Connecticut's boom years in the 80's, when state spending soared, and during its recession, when a billion-dollar deficit led Governor Weicker to push a personal income tax through the Legislature.
Mrs. Groark has criticized Mr. Larson's leadership in the years leading to the deficit; he emphasizes his efforts to protect working families from the income tax, which was designed in part to help business by shifting some of its tax burden to individuals. An opponent of the income tax in 1991, he now proposes a 25 percent tax cut for middle-income families totaling $287 million, so that their children may have the same opportunities that he had growing up in a working-class home in East Hartford in the 1950's and 60's. "An honest opposition to an income tax; an honest proposal to cut it," a television commercial for Mr. Larson proclaims.
Mr. Curry, a former State Senator who was elected Comptroller in 1990, agrees with Mr. Larson on many issues, among them the need to improve public schools, to create jobs and to fight crime, a key concern for voters despite a significant drop in reported crimes in recent years.
He, too, proposes a tax cut, but a much bigger one. He says the state could reduce local property taxes by $1 billion through economies in its own operations and the reduction of its mandates on local governments.
Mr. Larson and Mr. Curry have differed politely on the merits, and the plausibility, of their tax plans in a series of debates. But the greatest difference between them may be Mr. Curry's perception that government is "broken" -- not working in the public's interest -- and needs to be fixed.
Coming from the Democrats' progressive wing, which has grown up since the 70's largely outside the party leadership, Mr. Curry offers himself as an outsider who has the inside experience needed to do that fixing. The rejection of the party in 1990, he says, was a message that voters want change. "If you bought a car that turned out to be a lemon," he has said, "the question is whether you go back to the same old dealer, or do you move on? This is the party's chance to move on."
 
The Republican Choices
 For Republicans, who saw Mr. Weicker bolt their party and win the Governor's office last time, 1994 glimmers as the best opportunity to win the office since 1970. Four years ago Mr. Rowland lost to Mr. Weicker by fewer than 33,000 votes; this year he has held large leads in early polls.
In 1990 Mr. Rowland campaigned not only against an income tax, but also against any tax increase. This year he says he has a plan to phase out the income tax over five years. "We lived without it for 100 years, we don't need it now," he has said.
He has also promised to cut the corporate income tax and the inheritance tax, the latter move meant to stop wealthy elderly residents from changing their residence to states like Florida.
These cuts would be made possible by slashing state spending, which Mr. Rowland sees as a good end in itself. Connecticut's most conservative Congressman during his three terms from 1985 to 1991, he advocates a much smaller role for state government, and a larger one for local governments.
But his focus so far has been crime. No community is safe from violent crime, he tells suburban audiences, accusing prisons of coddling felons to the point that "the wrong people are scared." He wants to impose life sentences on felons convicted of two violent crimes and to cut prison costs by contracting to send inmates to other states.
But Mrs. Kezer, a former State Representative who was elected Secretary of the State in 1990, says Mr. Rowland is too conservative to win in a moderate state like Connecticut, where only two Republicans have won statewide elections since 1970. Those two are herself and Mr. Weicker when he won three terms in the Senate as a maverick liberal. Unlike Mr. Weicker, Mrs. Kezer has stayed with the party but has angered its leaders by challenging Mr. Rowland.
 
Term Limits Are Favored
 Mrs. Kezer has proposed to cut state spending by 10 percent in her first two years while cutting the income tax by 10 percent in each of four years. She would give the public a greater voice by bringing referendums, initiatives and recall elections to Connecticut while imposing term limits on elected officials and restricting the influence of lobbyists.
But Mrs. Kezer is most of all challenging her party leadership's commitment to Mr. Rowland and his conservative philosophy. Her argument that Mr. Rowland cannot win a general election, and that therefore he should not be nominated, has led to some pretty personal arguments.
After the 1990 election, Mrs. Kezer says, she, as a winner, worked to improve government in Connecticut, while Mr. Rowland, as a loser, turned a lackluster record in Congress into consulting work for the state's military contractors that raised his income to $392,000 in 1992 and $362,000 in 1993, years when those companies were laying off thousands of workers.
Mrs. Kezer, in a radio commercial, described Mr. Rowland's new career as peddling his influence. The leadership's response was that she had taken the campaign "into the gutter."

HEADLINE: Home Equity Loans Back in Fashion

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
BETTE CONNER and Ruth Jansson bought a tugboat. Leon Medvedow put a Jacuzzi in his bathroom. Alfonso Barba Jr. is developing what he hopes will be the next Thigh-Master.
Where did they find the money? In their houses. They took out home equity loans. 
 "Beats taking money out of mutual funds, and the interest rate sure beats borrowing some other way," said Ms. Conner, a retired schoolteacher, who lives with Ms. Jansson in a two-bedroom condominium unit in Norwalk, Conn. "There's even a tax benefit."
Demand for home equity loans has been growing in spurts for almost 20 years, especially since 1986, when Congress eliminated the tax deduction for interest on consumer debt but kept the deduction in place for mortgages and loans backed by mortgages.
Homeowners today, however, are not using these low-interest rate loans just to build a backyard deck or an extra bedroom, the traditional uses of home equity loans. They are also taking out loans to pay off high-interest credit-card loans, start businesses and buy cars and boats -- moves that some financial planners and consumer counselors recommend only with caution.
"Home equity loans are dangerous," said Luther R. Gatling, president and founder of the nonprofit Budget and Credit Counseling Service of New York City. "People often think it's a windfall, found money, a well. They don't realize it's their home, often their life savings, that they are putting at risk."
Home equity loans were held by 12.9 percent of the nation's homeowners as of March of this year, up from 11 percent in 1988, 6.8 percent in 1983 and 5.4 percent in 1977, according a recent study conducted by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center in Ann Arbor, Mich.
The huge volume of refinancings that occurred in 1992 and 1993 flattened home equity loan growth, as millions of Americans rolled existing loans into new first mortgages. In fact, the number of home equity loans rose by only 1 percent in 1993 and actually declined by 4 percent in 1992, according to SMR Research Corporation in Budd Lake, N.J., a consumer finance consulting company that released a study of home equity loans in February.
The rise in interest rates that began that same month, however, has abruptly ended the refinancing boom and, according to lenders, the number of home equity loans has been growing since then; no statistics, though, are available yet for this year.
"Anecdotally, I am hearing that it is picking up again," said Fritz Elmendorf, spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group in Arlington, Va. "If people want to tap equity in their homes, with rates rising, the most logical way now is a home equity loan rather than refinancing."
There are two basic types of home equity loans: traditional closed-end, lump-sum home equity loans with fixed monthly payments, which are essentially second mortgages, and revolving home equity lines of credit with variable rates in which funds are made accessible as needed.
The report by SMR Research predicts that home equity loan volume will continue to rise for the next five years as increasing interest rates all but eliminate refinancing activity and cause further declines in the number of first-mortgage applications.
The main borrowers, according to George R. Yacik, a vice president at SMR Research, are likely to be in those households that refinanced in 1992 and 1993. He said that they would continue to need new funds for everything from paying off bills to home repairs, from college tuitions to weddings. He also noted that since so many people now had 15-year and 20-year mortgages they would be able to tap more equity more quickly.
"If those people need money, and some of them undoubtedly will, it will not make sense for them to do another 'refi,' " Mr. Yacik said.
The diminishing volume of refinancings and first mortgage applications is also expected to spur lenders to offer unusually quick service (hours instead of weeks) and competitive terms (initial teaser rates as low as 5 percent) for home equity loans, which should attract even more business. This is particularly true for mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and finance companies, as they, rather than traditional banks and thrifts, stand to lose the most business from the decline in refinancings.
Gimmicks are also often a good gauge of a product's popularity, and in June, the Ford Motor Company's consumer finance subsidiary began offering home equity loans that include a 1 percent rebate good toward the purchase or lease of a Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury car or truck. "We have been real pleased with the response we have had so far," said Fred Stern, a spokesman with Ford Financial Services Group in Dallas, who declined to give sales figures.
FOR the borrower, the biggest difference between the two basic types of home equity loans is that lines of credit generally do not have as many fees or closing costs as home equity loans. Generally, a borrower taking out a line of credit will pay one up-front fee, often around $250. Fees for home equity loans can run into the thousands and commonly include credit-check fees, appraisal fees, attorney's fees, title insurance and points (a point is a fee, equal to one percent of the total loan, paid to the lender).
Lines of credit usually have lower initial rates, too, though they can eventually rise substantially higher than fixed-rate loans. Lifetime interest rate caps, or ceilings as they are called for home equity loans, can be as low as six percentage points or as high as an interest rate of 18 percent. Annual caps are rare.
"We have had a strong growth in the line, stronger than with the loan," said Karen Green, marketing director for Citibank in Manhattan. "People like lines of credit, though in some places, like Florida, people may be more comfortable with loans."
In New York, home equity loans -- but not lines of credit -- also have a mortgage tax, equal to 1.75 percent of the value of the loan.
"Lines become very attractive when borrowers they find out the mortgage tax is waived," Ms. Green said.
Generally, rates on home equity loans and lines of credit are set 1 percentage point to 1.5 percentage points above the prime rate, the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 75 percent of the nation's 30 largest banks (currently, the prime rate is 7.75 percent). By comparison, interest on personal loans and credit cards routinely ranges from 12 to 22 percent and, unlike interest on home equity loans, is not tax deductible.
It is the comparatively attractive interest rate, along with the tax deductibility, that makes home equity loans and lines of credit a popular form of financing for homeowners today, particularly since refinancing a mortgage to a lower interest isn't possible for most borrowers today.
The average interest rate being charged for all fixed-rate home equity loans is now 8.70 percent, slightly above the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate first mortgage, 8.63 percent, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage information service in Butler, N.J. Fixed-rate home equity loans, however, are usually offered in 5-, 7-, 10-, 15- and 20-year terms with the interest rate rising as the term lengthens. The average rate for a 15-year fixed-rate, for example, is 9.32 percent.
"Most of your fixed-rate product is in the mid-to-high 9's, and your intermediate terms -- 7, 5, 10 years -- is in the mid-to-upper 8's, though you may see some special pricing because this is an aggressive market among lenders," said Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates.
The average interest rate on a variable-rate home equity line of credit is currently 8.97 percent, though some lenders may offer lines of credit with special introductory interest rates as low as two points below prime; a few may even go as low as 5 percent. By comparison, the average rate on an adjustable-rate first mortgages is 5.58 percent.
"If you're only holding on to the loan for three years or so, go with either a line of credit or, if you're not borrowing a lot of money, a short-term fixed rate," Mr. Gumbinger said.
Prepayment penalties are uncommon on fixed-rate home equity loans, although they may exist for the first year or two on some loans. On variable-rate lines of credit, though, prepayment penalties, which generally run about 1 percent of the loan amount, are more common because the rates are often tied not only to the ups and downs of the prime rate but also to the size of the loan.
Lenders use prepayment penalties on lines of credit to avoid having a borrower take out a larger line of credit than they need in order to get a lower interest rate, and then quickly pay most of the loan off. (The average outstanding balance of a home equity line of credit in March was $15,000, up from $5,000 in 1988; for a home equity loan, the figure was $11,000, down $4,000 from 1988.)
"Some lines of credit may also have sliding interest rate scales that cause the rate to rise as the loan balance declines," Mr. Gumbinger said.
Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally slightly more expensive than comparable first mortgages because if a borrower defaults the home equity lender must wait in line behind the first-mortgage lender for the proceeds of a foreclosure. The interest rates are not substantially higher, however, because default rates on home equity loans are low.
"It is clearly not a problem," said Mr. Yacik with SMR Research.
A steady increase in the use of home equity loans does raise the specter that homeowners, particularly those who are not financially astute, will take on more debt than they can afford and risk foreclosure if they cannot keep up home equity payments.
Kathleen E. Keest, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center in Boston, said many home equity loans today were consumptive, like a wedding or a vacation, rather than productive, like home improvement or debt consolidation. She also noted that home equity loans continued to be illegal, except for home improvements and a small number of other uses, in Texas. The law prohibiting many home equity loans there was enacted after thousands of Texans lost their homes in the early 1980's when they lost their jobs in the oil-price-related recession and couldn't keep up loan payments.
"Home equity loans can be overused, and what you are putting at risk is your home," Ms. Keest said. "The traditional reasons that people go into default -- divorce, illness, loss of job -- can happen to anyone."
She added that there had also been problems, especially in low-income communities -- where borrowers tend to be more desperate, have fewer alternatives and less knowledge of financial matters -- with lenders selling home equity loans with very high interest rates, regardless of the borrower's credit-worthiness or ability to pay, and "balloon" loans that require a large single payment to be made in the future.
She added that part of the problem was that lenders were often less attentive to underwriting standards for home equity loans than they were for other types of loans. They often judge whether a borrower can pay back the loan not by their current income but only by the amount of home equity they are putting up as collateral. "They're called 'sucker sales,"' Ms. Keest said.
Aside from unethical lenders selling loans with usurious rates, the biggest danger facing most borrowers with a home equity loan is what they do with the money.
In the 1980's, home equity loans were ballyhooed as an easy, safe way to finance a second home. The real estate crash of the early 90's has made many people leery of owning one home, much less two; only 10 percent of the home equity loans surveyed by the University of Michigan study were used to buy real estate, as opposed to 16 percent in 1988. The percentage didn't change (12 percent) for home equity lines of credit.
The most common use for both traditional home equity loans (44 percent) and home equity lines of credit (64 percent) remains home improvements, according to the University of Michigan survey. Because making improvements to a home -- even if it as frivolous sounding as adding a jacuzzi -- is usually considered an investment that increases a home's value, using a home equity loan for this purpose is generally considered reasonable.
"I got a great deal, " said Mr. Medvedow, a businessman in New Haven who took out a $75,000 line of credit put in a jacuzzi and make bathroom renovations and well as pay off another line of credit with a higher interest rate he had taken out. "A variable-rate line at 5.99 percent."
MS. GREEN of Citibank said that many homeowners today were also taking out home equity loans to send their children to college, particularly if they had a high household income and their children did not qualify for financial aid. "We find that when someone is younger, say their late 30's, they tend to use them for debt consolidation or home renovation, and if they're over 45, then college costs," she said.
Refinancing of debt has become a major use of home equity loans, as it was for home refinancing in 1992 and 1993. Of borrowers with traditional home equity loans, 68 percent in the University of Michigan survey said they used the money to repay debts or pay them at a lower interest rate in 1994, compared with 34 percent in 1988. Of borrowers with a home equity line of credit, 39 percent used the loan for debt consolidation in 1994 versus 31 percent in 1988. Credit card debt was the most commonly cited type for borrowers of both traditional home equity loans (33 percent) and lines of credit (23 percent) this year.
"Lower interest rates on home equity loans compared with other types of consumer credit have encouraged homeowners to consolidate their debts," said Dr. Richard T. Curtin, director of surveys with the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center, whose study on home equity loans was commissioned by the Consumer Bankers Association and the American Financial Services Association, a trade group in Washington, and consisted of 2,537 interviews conducted from November 1993 to March 1994.
Dr. Curtin also added that the gains in home equity borrowing resulting from increased debt consolidation did not necessarily mean an increase in overall consumer indebtedness. "The shift has benefited consumers by lowering their interest costs of their debt," he said.
Mr. Gatling of the Budget and Credit Counseling Service of New York City noted, however, that some home owners ran up more bills after paying them off with a home equity loan. "People often use home equity loans to pay off high-interest credit cards, and that's a good idea as long as they are disciplined about their future spending," he said.
"What happens is that the moment you use your home equity loan to pay off your bills, a computer is going to say that you are a preferred customer even when you know you are the same old dog you always were, and you are going to get get all these offers for credit," he said. "Guess what happens."
Because of the large number of lay-offs in the last five years, starting a business has also become a popular use for a home equity loan. Of borrowers with a home equity line of credit, 28 percent said they used the money, at least in part, for this purpose in 1993 and 1994, compared with only 7 percent in 1988. Among those who took out traditional home equity loans, however, only 4 percent used the money for business expenses, less than in 1988, when the figure was 6 percent.
Mr. Barba took out a $41,000 home equity loan at 8.125 percent with 1.5 points on his ranch-style home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, to finance the development of a leg exercise he has invented called the SoloSizer. He also plans to renovate his home. "I went to my bank, and they said this was the kind of loan that made the most sense," he said.
Using a home equity loan to start a business is an iffy proposition, however. Because the business-owner has his home on the line, it may give him the extra incentive to succeed. It may also help attract outside investors who like to see a personal investment made by the owners of start-up businesses. Home-owners should be aware, though, that most new businesses fail.
Another iffy use for a home equity loan is buying a car. If you need the car, that's one thing, Mr. Gatling said. If you're taking out a third of your home's equity to buy a Porsche, that's something else. Forget that the interest and some of the costs associated with a home equity loan are tax deductible and the rate is likely to be several percentage points lower than a car loan.
Buying a boat, as Ms. Conner and Ms. Jansson did when they took out a $40,000 line of credit at 5.99 percent to buy the $46,000, 26-foot Nordic tug, Annie, is even more likely to fall into the consumptive category. "We couldn't help it," Ms. Conner said. "We decided to tap some equity when we saw this fantastic boat. It was really more expensive than what we planned. We hemmed and hawed."
Mr. Gatling sighs when he hears such stories. "If you can afford it and are using home equity as a way to get a lower rate or the tax deduction, fine," he said.
As for other pleasurable but less-than-practical uses, like vacations, clothes, weddings or entertaining? "That's when you start to get into trouble," Mr. Gatling said.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Call It Alliance Capital;
A New Name for a Building

 BODY:
Alliance Capital Management, the growing mutual funds company, has had its headquarters at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, the old Burlington House at 54th Street, for eight years. But that seemed destined to be one of New York's better-kept secrets. For years, Burlington Industries had a lock on the building's name. And then, in what may have been one of midtown's most on-again-off-again recent deals, Mastercard International signed on for enough space to warrant its name's going on the front door.
"I was always envious of these other companies that had their name on our building," said Dave Williams, Alliance's chairman of the board. "It's just such excellent advertising." 
 Finally, Alliance is getting name recognition. Tomorrow, signs are to go up on the kiosk in front of the building announcing the home of Alliance Capital. If the in-progress overhaul of the building's facade goes as scheduled, new lettering spelling out Alliance Capital will be unveiled over the entrance in a few months.
Apparently, size really is relative. Alliance, which first moved into about 100,000 square feet in the building in 1986, has grown explosively. Today it has 250,000 square feet and it is cramped in that. The company is doubling its space, taking about two thirds of the space that Mastercard, which is moving to Westchester County, has left available. Burlington, meanwhile, has moved many of its operations to North Carolina, leaving it with only 160,000 square feet. In one swoop, Alliance has become the building's largest tenant by far.
In part because it was so adamant about having its name on the building, Alliance did not consider subletting from Mastercard. It insisted on negotiating directly with the Fisher Brothers, the building's owners. The Fisher Brothers released Mastercard from its lease obligations. That was no sacrifice -- the rent they have negotiated with Alliance in 1994 is far richer than what Mastercard agreed to pay when it first negotiated its lease in the recession-mired early 90's. In fact, some real estate insiders say the Fishers may have to share some profits with Mastercard.
Alliance, meanwhile, may have to chase its own sublet tenants. The company plans to move about 150 employees from 1285 Avenue of the Americas, the 52d Street building at which it has about 50,000 square feet of space. And it may eventually move some employees over from 135 West 50th Street, where it has 85,000 square feet. But some of its lease obligations for those spaces stretch out another four years.
"We're still trying to figure out how to configure the space, and who to move in," said Denise Bernardo, a vice president of administrative services.

HEADLINE: The Jobs Issue And the Primaries

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WHEN the singer James Taylor came to Westchester last Monday to help Hamilton Fish Jr. raise funds for his bid to win the 19th Congressional District seat, he chose a song he had composed to commemorate the return of free elections in Brazil in 1985.
"I thought it was appropriate," Mr. Taylor said, "for such a hopeful time." Presented originally before an audience of 300,000 in a Rio de Janeiro soccer stadium, the song, "Only a Dream in Rio," was also warmly received by the nearly 100 Democrats who filled the courtyard of the Bedford home of Irving Farber, a lawyer, and his wife, Jean. 
 That was because Mr. Fish and the two other Democrats running for the seat being vacated by Mr. Fish's Republican father, Representative Hamilton Fish, are seeking a change of similar proportions -- transforming the long-held Republican redoubt into a Democratic district.
There are also seven Republican candidates vying to keep the Hudson Valley district, which extends from Poughkeepsie to North White Plains, in Republican control. The choices will be made on Tuesday, Primary Day, after an often frantic campaign that saw spending and campaigning reach general-election proportions.
More than $2 million will have been spent by the candidates in the primaries, the largest amount, $500,000 to $600,000, by Dennis Mehiel of Armonk, founder of the Four M Corporation in Valhalla, which makes corrugated boxes and partitions and employs 1,700 workers in 20 plants.
Mr. Mehiel, who was Westchester County Democratic chairman until he quit to run for Congress, has used his business experience and his personal wealth to press his campaign, spending $325,000 of his own money to carry his "Mehiel ticket" theme of economic recovery to voters through local and regional television.
He has taken aim at Mr. Fish, whom he considers his chief rival, by accusing him of misusing earlier campaign financing -- the two candidates lost to Representative Nita M. Lowey in an earlier three-way primary for the 20th Congressional District seat -- and saying that Mr. Fish, a Garrison resident, published anti-Semitic articles when he presided over The Nation magazine.
Mr. Fish, who denies the charges, is senior adviser at Human Rights Watch, a United States-based monitoring organization, and a consultant to Doctors of the World, a relief organization. He has spent $210,000 in the campaign. He says the "single dominating need in the Hudson Valley district is job creation" in the wake of massive layoffs, especially among white collar workers.
He is the grandson of Hamilton Fish, who was elected to Congress from the same district in 1920, and he traces his lineage through two other Representatives named Hamilton Fish. Earlier family members served in the Revolutionary War and one descendant was Governor of New York.
The third Democrat in the primary race is Neil McCarthy of Lewisboro, a lawyer who ran against the incumbent Representative Fish in 1992, but lost by a 60-40 margin, closer than previous opponents. This was partly because of the remapping of the district, which cut into the Republican plurality in registration.
Mr. McCarthy, like his opponents, sees the downsizing of major companies such as International Business Machines as the principal issue in the district. "We need more jobs, more investment and re-education of unemployed workers," Mr. McCarthy said. He has spent $80,000 in the campaign to overcome "Fish's name and Mehiel's fortune."
On the Republican side, the biggest spender by far has been Paul W. Bucha of Somers, a real estate developer who has raised $465,000, $250,000 of it his own money, to address what he says are the major issues in the district: "jobs, taxes, the economy and crime and safety."
He says "the economic well-being" of a once fiscally comfortable district has been undermined by the disruption caused by downsizing of major corporations, "and those who still have jobs are worried about taxes."
A former two-term member of Congress, Joseph J. DioGuardi, who represented the Long Island Sound communities of the 20th Congressional District from 1985 to 1988, is now in the race for the 19th Congressional District. He says 200,000 of his original constituents have been placed, through redistricting, in the district he is seeking to represent.
Mr. DioGuardi, who is moving from New Rochelle, where he represented the 20th Congressional District, to Mount Pleasant in the 19th Congressional District, has spent $200,000 in an effort to return to Congress from a district that he says is hindered by a weakened economy and the fear of crime. He says he was the only certified public accountant in Congress when he served there and that fiscal reforms are still needed.
 
One Incumbent in the Race
 Mr. DioGuardi, also running on the Right-to-Life Party line, is one of three Republicans in the primary who are seeking Conservative Party endorsement. The others are Mr. Bucha and Guy Parisi of Chappaqua, a lawyer and former village justice.
Mr. Parisi was the original choice of the Westchester County Republican Chairman, Anthony J. Colavita, but the decision was left to a primary when the multiplicity of interested office seekers became apparent. Mr. Parisi has spent about $200,000 seeking the nomination.
The only officeholder among the candidates is Assemblyman Glenn Warren of Fishkill, who has represented a Dutchess County Assembly District for 18 years. He says he has a clear record of "conservative leadership" and finds "crime and the economy" the main issues in his district. His spending has totaled $120,000.
Sue W. Kelly of Katonah, the only woman in the race, has spent $200,000 promoting fiscal reform, such as "cutting taxes and spending," as a major item on Washington's legislative agenda. She said she would cut entitlement programs, sparing only Social Security and veteran's benefits.
 
Selections for County Court
 Another Republican, John Flanagan Jr. of Brewster, is a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve who sees crime and taxes as major issues, particularly among elderly and retired people. He has spent about $25,000 pursuing the nomination.
Still another candidate, Joseph M. Corrigan of Kent, a Nynex employee, has emphasized what he says is the still unresolved issue of servicemen missing in action in Vietnam, where he served and has since played a role seeking to resolve the matter. He could not be reached to discuss how much he has spent on his campaign.
Democrats voting in the Westchester primary will also be asked to select four of six candidates for County Court judge. Two of those seeking the bench are now serving as judges: Asher Katz, who has been a Greenburgh Town Judge for 19 years, and Brenda L. Dowery, City Court Judge in Mount Vernon since 1987.
Others seeking the county judicial posts are Robert DiBella, Paul W. Pickelle, Ron Stokes and Ronald J. Koerner.
 
Appointment Unconfirmed
 Mr. DiBella has been the law clerk to State Supreme Court Justice Anthony A. Scarpino Jr. since 1989 and before that served in a similar capacity for the Yonkers City Court.
Mr. Pickelle was Corporation Counsel in Yonkers for a year during the crisis over federally mandated integrated housing. Earlier, he was a special assistant district attorney investigating the Donald Manes corruption case in Queens.
Mr. Stokes has practiced criminal law for 16 years, much of it representing indigent defendants. He was twice appointed to the County Court by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, but the Republican-controlled State Senate has failed in recent years to convene to endorse such appointments.
Mr. Koerner has had 32 years of trial experience, practicing in Federal and state courts in New York City and Westchester, specializing in white-collar crimes and constitutional issues.

HEADLINE: At Work;
A Big Union Win in the South

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
IT came down to money and fairness, and maybe not in that order, when the workers at the Tultex Corporation voted to join a union last month.
True, the lost wages and benefits hurt. Clifford C. Broady and his wife, Deborah, both work at the company's Martinsville, Va., textile plant, he as a materials handler in the knitting department, she as an automated screen printer. They say they have seen their household income drop by almost a third since Tultex made cutbacks it contends were needed to cope with an unexpected drop in profitability. "We're struggling to survive," Mr. Broady said of his reduced income. 
 But the money wasn't everything. "The rest was about gaining respect on the job," Mr. Broady said. "You want your boss to tell you you're doing a good job once in a while."
For want of a pat on the back, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union won its biggest victory since it organized the J. P. Stevens Company plant in neighboring North Carolina 20 years ago. The workers at Tultex voted overwhelmingly, 1,321 to 710, in the union's favor, ending the nonunion tradition at the 57-year-old active-wear company.
If the victory does not signal a widespread resurgence of the labor movement, it does indicate that in the right circumstances unions can win significant victories, even in areas of the country generally unsympathetic to labor or in segments of the economy inherently difficult to organize. Since 1980, the Service Employees International Union, for example, has grown to more than a million members, from 650,000, by organizing public-sector workers and the lower-wage service workers traditional trade unions have ignored. S.E.I.U.'s nine-year-old "Justice for Janitors" campaign has brought 35,000 janitors in a dozen cities into the fold.
In the more traditional labor venue of mill workers, organizers measure success by the number of campaigns that end in elections. Last year, the textile workers' union in the Southeast ran 14 elections and won 13, up from a half dozen victories the previous year, according to Bruce Raynor, director of the union's Southern region. Tultex is the fourth win in the region this year.
Mr. Raynor theorizes that even in a small Southern town the implied social contract between employer and employee can change. The old, paternalistic system, in which companies assured workers they would be taken care of and employees believed them, is dying. Both sides agree that C-SPAN-like coverage by a local cable station influenced the outcome of the campaign in Martinsville, but the union did not radically change its tactics or beef up its staff to win. "We didn't increase the number of organizers," Mr. Raynor said. "People are saying enough is enough."
The textile union had been trying to organize Tultex, which makes fleece for sweatsuits and other sports apparel, for years without success. As recently as 1990, after a round of streamlining and modernization at the company, the union lost a close election.
In January, the company announced wage cuts and a decision to end its contribution to the employees' 401(k) plan, a move that motivated workers to seek the union's help to start another campaign. They soothed the union's skepticism by gathering authorization cards from about 60 percent of the work force at the Martinsville plant. "They were dropping them off in buckets," said Michael Zucker, one of the directors of the drive in Martinsville.
The two-month campaign, by all accounts, was not friendly. The company ran ads showing violence during a strike by the United Mine Workers at the Pittston Coal Company. The union countered with film of the new vacation home of Tultex chief executive John Franck, built, the ad said, while the company was in trouble.
MARTINSVILLE'S business community coalesced around the company. The union picked up support it had not received in previous campaigns from several churches and, it says, workers from other companies. Ernest Bennett, another campaign director, said the union got the benefit of worker anger over changes made without their input. "There is more anger and frustration right now than I've seen in 15 or 16 years of organizing," he said. "The pie is shrinking, and people aren't consulted."
The company failed this time where it had succeeded before, Clifford Broady believes, because it has changed from a congenial, family-owned enterprise to a modern, impersonal corporation. "Everything is focused on customers and stockholders, not on employees," he said. "That's their downfall."
Tultex is doing nothing more than following the lead of dozens of other corporations as they move to become more competitive, but for many workers, the new order represents a U-turn toward downward mobility. Between them, Clifford and Deborah Broady usually had a baseline income of a little over $20,000 a year. With bonuses, overtime and shift premiums, they could ratchet that up in a good year to around $30,000. Those days are over, Mr. Broady says, adding, "I've got to readjust my living."
The union contends cuts made during the last year have cost workers an average of $2,850 in benefits and $3,000 in wages.
The company says it has brought its wage and bonus structure into line with its competitors. One change, a profit-sharing plan that replaced the annual Christmas bonus, has the potential to be more lucrative for employees, a company spokeswoman said, but only if Tultex returns to its former profitability. The profit-sharing plan "fits in with our strategy that we all have a stake in the company," said Kathy Rogers, Tultex's communications director.
The cuts in January were necessary, Ms. Rogers says, because of a drop in demand for fleecewear late in 1993 from customers like Sears, Wal-Mart and Kmart. The company also does private label lines for Nike, Levi Strauss and Reebok.
The election was certified by the National Labor Relations Board in late August and the two sides will probably proceed quickly to contract negotiations. The company appears resigned to its new relationship with its workers. "The election is over and people have spoken their minds," Ms. Rogers said. "We will have to learn how to work together." Her analysis of the vote is not so far off from the union view. "Anytime you take away their pay it angers people," she said. "It doesn't sit well with anyone."

HEADLINE: Conversations: Laurie B. Midgette;
Lured by Fate (and Love of Children) To Be a Teacher in East New York

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
LAURIE B. MIDGETTE teaches English in a high school on a jagged edge of Brooklyn. She stands at a blackboard and likens writing to dance, the travails of Romeo and Juliet to an interethnic, urban romance. In the background lie the streets of East New York.
Thomas Jefferson High School, where Ms. Midgette has taught for four years, looms large in this poor community. Its cream-colored walls stand in contrast to the red brick of the housing projects that sit nearby. 
 More than 1,900 students go there, 90 percent of them black, 20 percent with roots in the West Indies and Latin America. Many live in poverty. As of 1990, the per capita income in East New York was $8,013 (compared with $16,281 for the city as a whole), the unemployment rate hovered at 14.2 percent, and a quarter of the area's households received public assistance. More than half of all households below the poverty line were headed by single women with children.
Despite such dismal realities, Ms. Midgette, who turned 30 recently, said most children she encounters have the will to learn and achieve. More often missing, she said, is commitment by some educators. "We had ancestors who had a Bible and a tree, and they taught people how to read and write," said Ms. Midgette, who has been a teacher for seven years. "Today we have staff development, and all the supplies, and we're still having trouble.
"I have been in meetings where children are never mentioned," she said. "We have to look at the quality of programs, and the quality of teaching that's going on."
Ms. Midgette believes fate first introduced her to the children of East New York. In 1988, soon after getting her master's at Cornell University, she was one of thousands to apply for a teaching job in New York City. She requested a slot in Brooklyn and got the last high school English position available -- a job at William H. Maxwell Vocational High School, a few blocks from Jefferson.
Ms. Midgette knew little about East New York. "I'd never lived in this community," she said, "but I wanted to go where they needed good teachers. And I knew I was a good teacher." While at Maxwell, she heard stories about Jefferson, about children setting off fire alarms and bullying other students, and she told herself she would never teach there. Then, in 1990, Jefferson's now retired principal, Carol Beck, asked her to come work with her special education students, those considered emotionally disturbed or learning disabled. Enticed by the challenge, and impressed with Ms. Beck, Ms. Midgette took the job.
 
Romeo and Juliet
 Ms. Midgette's lessons and methods go beyond the norm. She uses "The Game of Life" and "Monopoly" to reinforce her students' reading skills, to teach them how to manage money and to solve real-life dilemmas. She asks her students to read "Romeo and Juliet" and relate its themes of love and parental disapproval to situations in their lives. For the summer, she asked them to read a play by August Wilson, and create their own character and drama.
And for a generation raised on videos, she has likened the writing of a paragraph to the choreographing of a dance. A paragraph must also have a rhythm, theme and structure, she explains. "We need to make the situations in school as realistic as we can in terms of what they run into in real life," said Ms. Midgette. "I tell the students grades are like pay. If you work really hard, you get what you deserve. These are the skills of life that you're learning here, and you have to relate them to the adult world."
Last year, at the request of the school's principal, Lena B. Medley, Ms. Midgette started a "rites of passage" program through which students opened their first savings accounts and received training in areas ranging from hygiene to leadership.
The program grew out of talks by the school's staff on breaking the cycle of violence claiming so many children. "We started to talk about the way we were brought up," said Ms. Midgette. "If a person is not trained how to be an adult, how can we expect them to act like an adult? You need to be trained to be whatever we ask you to be, and that includes being a man and a woman."
Ms. Midgette spent the summer getting ready for her role overseeing Jefferson's new mini-school, an academy that will prepare incoming ninth-graders for the advanced math and science courses every high school student must now pass to graduate.
"When you talk about raising standards for children of color, it becomes a heated discussion," she said. "Standards should already be high. But it's one thing to talk. It's another thing to provide the supplies and resources necessary to raise them."
Some credit her easy rapport with students to the fact that she looks as though she could be their running buddy. She has a big smile and a schoolgirl face framed by a crown of corn rows. But she insists that her respect for her students, not her appearance, connecting her to students. "If you see a kid come in and put their head down on their desk, you don't say, 'Get up.' You speak to them. 'Did you eat this morning?' 'How was your weekend?' "
 
Above and Beyond
 Ms. Midgette said she has a particular understanding for her special education students, whom she views through the prism of her own past. She grew up in a foster home on Long Island. There was a brief time after her birth when she could not see, and she wore corrective shoes as a child because one leg was shorter than the other.
"I just realized I could have been one of them, being in a foster home, and being in the system," she said. "And the reason I wasn't is because every step of the way there was someone to guide me."
She is single but often plays mother to youths whose home lives are tattered and worn. "I give my students my home phone number," she said. "There are a lot of things we as teachers are not supposed to do, but we have to, like having a child stay over because they have nowhere to go."
She buys cards and gifts for students' birthdays. For the awkward girl who dons a pair of stockings, there are cries of "You go girl, look at those legs." For the young man who doesn't dress so well, there is a compliment for his beautiful handwriting. "You find that one thing," she said.
She encourages young people to find the talents within themselves and the people who inhabit their world. She recalled a conversation with a girl who was lamenting the dearth of role models in her life. "I said, 'Why don't you be one?' We can't look to people we can't touch as role models. Sometimes we have to look where we go to school, where we work, or look deeper within ourselves."
Ms. Midgette said she does not let the prospect of violence interfere with her mission. But its specter hovers. Last year the 75th Precinct, which encompasses East New York and part of Canarsie, had the highest homicide rate in the city. And two years ago, Jefferson became a symbol of random violence when three students were killed and a teacher critically wounded in its hallways.
Ms. Midgette was in her classroom when one of the shootings occurred only feet from her door. On another painful day, she saw a mob of children surround a boy, then flee. The boy had been stabbed. She did not dwell on whether a face in the mob belonged to one of her students. "If you're afraid of the kids, you can't teach them," she said.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: CRAMMING;
So Many Minds To Be Changed, So Little Time

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON plans to address the public's dwindling regard for his performance this week in the time-honored manner of every poll-plagued modern President: by shaking his staff up, booting some advisers out and shuffling others around. President Bush did this, ditching his chief of staff when his ratings and the economy sagged in 1991. President Reagan tossed his top aides overboard to relieve public distress over the Iran-contra scandal. President Carter fired half his Cabinet when inflation and voters' anger ran amok in 1979. Sacking the staff is Washington's folk remedy for the pain of inflamed public opinion. It only has one drawback: too often, the cure doesn't take.
That is the Democrats' fear of the month. Mr. Clinton came home from the beach last week, tanned of face but electorally as pallid as ever, convinced that a fresh slug of discipline and Washington know-how from Leon Panetta -- his new chief of staff, a career Democrat and professional whip cracker -- is enough to steady his Administration. But increasingly, Mr. Clinton's loyal critics in Congress and Democratic research circles are unconvinced. And they are starting to advance the notion that what ails the White House is systemic, not localized, and that only a basic change of direction will revive his political fortunes. 
 In Beltwayspeak they want the President not just to redraw his seating chart but also to return to his "new Democrat roots" or "govern from the center." In real terms, they fear his handling of many major issues has enabled Republicans to persuade the public he is the sort of tie-dyed, union-label liberal that voters shun. They argue that the only way to erase that stain is to pursue policies that can attract moderate Republicans as well as Democrats.
 
The New New Clinton
 It is a fateful choice, for Mr. Clinton is trying to reverse a public-image problem that took two full years to create. Even worse, he returns from vacation to a stack of issues that will not wait, and their resolutions are likely, by any reasonable measure, to define the public assessment of his competence for months to come.
The stack starts here: the President's health-insurance legislation is foundering, with only a few months left in the year to save it. His campaign-spending reforms are stalled, in no small part by his own party; his global trade agreement is endangered, and his welfare-reform plan is dead for this year and no sure sell in 1995.
Offshore, Cuba is calmed, at least for now. But a politically contentious invasion of Haiti looms, Bosnia is poised to flare again and North Korea remains unpredictable. Mr. Clinton faces separate summits with Boris Yeltsin in September, Asian trade rivals in November and Latin American leaders in December.
His thin line of support in Congress seems destined to vanish in a Republican sweep of the fall elections. In some polls, 6 in 10 Americans now declare little or no trust in his abilities, and surveys show the political independents whose votes carried him to power are deserting in droves.
In an interview late last month, one of Mr. Clinton's top Midwestern strategists, who asked not to be identified, said: "Expectations were pretty high. We were going to do 100 days this, 100 days that. But I think there's a strong image out here that he and the Democrats aren't up to this thing. I think they've got to right this ship pretty soon."
Nobody disputes that Mr. Clinton, already adept at the quick change, needs to reinvent himself, not just his government. The debate among his supporters is over which way to go. Should he be a newly savvy and competent advocate of the Democratic world view, which seems to be the preference of his White House advisers? Or should he follow a slightly different course, modeling himself as a pragmatist who doesn't care which party claims credit as long as the Government's course furthers the public good?
Like so much about Mr. Clinton, the question would be easier to settle if the President had an established position. But he has often played both sides of this political game.
The President has, in fact, reinvented himself before. He won office as the Democrat who stole the Republicans' best lines on food-stamp cheats, stood up to the rapper Sister Souljah and decried the "brain-dead politics" that led Washington politicians to reject progress in pursuit of partisan gain. That is the President who later pushed centrist legislation, broadly backed in principle if not always in the details, to set up a national service program, to move welfare recipients from dependency to steady incomes and to shrink the Federal bureaucracy. And it is the same President who said repeatedly last month that crime victims are of all political stripes, and that the importance of passing anti-crime legislation surpassed the question of which party would gain most from it.
That same President, however, has won most of his legislative victories with few Republican votes, preferring to roll his opponents with the same coalition of unions, elderly and other beneficiaries of Federal protection that almost elected Hubert Humphrey.
That same President was branded a social-issues liberal after unwittingly making gay servicemen's rights the first issue of his presidency, and a free-spending liberal after making a $20 billion "stimulus" of new Federal programs, financed by deficit spending, his first economic cause. Then
he was branded a big-Government liberal after casting his proposed health care overhaul in terms of a new Federal "right," the right to be insured against sickness, even at added taxpayer expense.
Mr. Clinton's critics say his heart and brain are in the proper place, but he has miscalculated by using the strategy of a Democratic era long dead. Some note that his senior staff -- from Mr. Panetta to his senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos, to his top lobbyist, Pat Griffin, to Tony Coelho, Democratic party strategist -- grew up learning how to ram Democratic legislation past Republican minorities in Congress.
"What Clinton promised to do as President was to get beyond the left-right debate," said one mainstream Democratic adviser, who requested anonymity. "In the campaign he was defining new challenges of the 90's that didn't automatically fit into the ideologically polarized boxes of the 80's. And what's happened instead, with the exception of Nafta, is that he's wound up taking the old partisan side of issues. It's the big reason why he's in trouble."
The President's advisers argue that those labels are unfair -- that, for example, the President moved leagues away from his original health-care goals in a failed effort to make his cause bipartisan. Mr. Clinton has groused, in recent hairshirting sessions with journalists, that every time he takes a step toward the G.O.P. position, Senator Bob Dole or Representative Newt Gingrich take two steps backward.
True enough. Republicans in Congress have been unusually united against Mr. Clinton's policies. Still, it is also true that the Administration passed up early opportunities to strike a health-insurance deal far more expansive than any within its reach now because of objections from the union and elderly lobbies. And while the Republicans balked at compromising on the crime bill, the White House's own strategy was to enact the legislation without them, keeping an election-season plum to themselves.
The strategy, if that is indeed what it is, is surely defensible. If Mr. Panetta's managerial skill and insider savvy turn out to be as billed, and Mr. Clinton completes his sophomore year with a string of Democratic victories in foreign and domestic policy, the White House could recapture the whiz-kid aura it showed off just a year ago, after the President rammed a budget and Nafta and a measure to shrink the bureaucracy through Congress in quick succession.
But make no mistake: It's a big gamble. Failure is likely to seal Mr. Clinton's nascent image as a can't-do guy.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Lasting Exile Of Cuban Spirits

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

 BODY:
FOR many Cuban exiles, Cuba is like a long-lost lover in a faded photograph for whom they try to maintain their passion during decades of marriage to someone else. It is barely a reality, and almost a dream.
As yet another exodus from Cuba reminds them of their original journey, many exiles are focusing with a kind of melancholic clarity on the fact that a reverse migration grows more unlikely with every year. Most Cubans will never return to live in their island homeland. 
 Instead, exile has become for them a place in and of itself, a state of mind, an emotional limbo, a country neither here nor there.
 
Holding On
 Only the exile leaders who devote themselves professionally to their hatred of Fidel Castro -- Jorge Mas Canosa, the radio show hosts in Miami -- can maintain a pure focus on La Causa. Thirty-four years after they started leaving, most Cuban-Americans lead daily lives immersed in the American here and now. And yet to let go once and for all of the sweet pain that is their exile would be unthinkable.
It would mean that Castro had finally won.
It would also mean they were no longer political refugees but merely immigrants, bound together by love for ropa vieja (shredded beef) and the muscular ballads of Beny More. It would pluck out the core of their special identity.
"If we admit that, in fact, there's no going back, it would force a kind of terrible reckoning," said Pablo Medina, a novelist who left Cuba at 12 and now lives in New Jersey. "We'd have to put down the torch of the lost society, and sink some roots. It's our reluctance to be here that marks us as special. Without that, if it were actually our choice and not our fate, then we would be just another immigrant group."
The Exile, as Cubans call it, began when Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, and within 14 years about 550,000 Cubans had fled to the United States. In 1980, about 135,000 left in the Mariel boatlift, and another 20,000 are expected to arrive annually under the agreement reached Friday between Cuba and the United States.
Most Cubans eventually settled in Miami, achieving significant political and economic power. Their children and grandchildren, hundreds of thousands of them, grew up in the heart of The Exile, but emotionally and culturally distant from it.
In a poll last year by Florida International University, only 29 percent of Cuban-born household heads interviewed said that they intended to move back to Cuba from the Miami area if Castro fell. A 1990 Miami Herald poll found that 14 percent expected to return permanently. And these are only stated intentions, which may never be realized by any but the most homesick.
Most Cuban-Americans would be more likely to shuttle back and forth on the 34-minute flight between Miami and Havana, said Lisandro Perez, director of the university's Cuban Research Institute. They might conduct business, rekindle relationships with distant relatives or try to lay claim to their old properties.
But even those in middle age have spent more time in this country than in the Cuba of their childhood, building careers here and growing accustomed to the creature comforts of a developed country. They see life in Cuba, even after Castro, as a struggle. And, most significantly, it is difficult to pass the passion of exile to their American-born children.
In Miami, Vanessa Garcia, who is 9, cannot stand it when her grandfather teases her by pretending to think she is a balsera, a refugee who arrived by raft. "She gets so insulted," said her mother, Marta Garcia, 39, a life insurance claims examiner. "She'll say: 'No! I was born in Mercy Hospital. I'm an American.' The only Cuban thing that I have any hope of passing on to her is the Spanish language."
Mr. Perez, on the other hand, said that many Cuban-American children, particularly in Miami, practically inherit strong feelings about Cuba. "I don't particularly lecture my 10-year-old son on Castro, but he knows that he's a bad guy," Mr. Perez said. "It's as much a part of the culture here as Cuban food and dominoes."
For many, the public face of the exile community, which is singlemindedly anti-Castro, does not begin to express their private reality -- the complex emotional accommodations that exile forces upon them. Mr. Medina said that he considers himself a kind of gypsy, carting his country around inside him as he moves about the United States.
Even some young Cuban-Americans born in this country feel displaced. Absorbing their community's romantic ideal of the homeland, they swear that they will go "home" at the first opportunity.
 
Seeking Roots
 "It's a yearning to truly belong somewhere," said Carlos Betancourt, 28, a painter who was born in Puerto Rico and now lives in Miami. "I will probably always be fractured in my identity, but an artist looks for his roots."
Since the recent exodus from Cuba began, Mr. Betancourt has videotaped every television report of the hijacked ferries, the makeshift rafts and the Coast Guard cutters packed with refugees. Sadly, he said, what he calls his "nostalgia" for Cuba has been painful for his parents, forcing them to relive memories that were safely repressed.
In more cases, though, it is the parent who insists on remembering. The child cannot. Esther Olavarria Cruz's mother suffered a series of breakdowns brought on by the trauma of leaving everything behind. She is an exile every day of her life. But Ms. Cruz, 37, said that she herself does not feel any keen psychic pain. She left Cuba at the age of 5.
In college, Ms. Cruz belonged to a group of Cuban-Americans who obsessively debated their identity. After a trip to Cuba, however, Ms. Cruz knew that she was no longer a Cuba Cuban, but a Miami Cuban: an immigrant living in an ethnic enclave, married to a Cuban-American and surrounded by her extended family. "I probably will never feel completely American," said Ms. Cruz, a lawyer. "But I think visiting Cuba really crystallized for me the fact that I didn't belong there anymore. I would be a stranger."
David Dominguez, 18, designed himself a go-kart helmet that has the Cuban flag on the front and the American flag on the back. But he is in no way a divided soul, his mother, Maria, said. Even she, at 47, does not feel torn. She has a double rather than a split identity, she said. "Do I feel Cuban or American? I guess I'm both. Like you have a mother and a father and love both dearly."
As director of the Human Rights Institute at St. Thomas University in Miami, Ms. Dominguez went to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo several years ago to visit Haitians detained there. She had not been to Cuba since 1961, when, at 14, she escaped without her parents as part of Operation Peter Pan, which smuggled thousands of children out. "I felt such a feeling of sadness when I saw the landscape there," she said. "It was so gray and barren and not like the lusciousness that I associate with the island. I knew it was just a different area geographically, but it made me feel let down. My memories were so much more vivid." All the same, she asked the base commander to take her to the border so she could reach over into Cuban territory and scoop up some soil. And the soil, together with a small rock, sits enclosed in a glass box on her desk. It is what is left of her Cuba.

HEADLINE: Soothsayers as Business Advisers;
You Are Going to Go on a Long Trip . . .

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE 

 BODY:
ZAP, zap, zap, sometimes it seems the same thing is on every channel. Whether it's 3 P.M. or 3 A.M., there's Dionne Warwick and her psychic friends selling advice on love, money and success. In a nation where the power of crystals and the likelihood that angels hover nearby prompt more contemplation than ridicule, it may not be surprising that one million people a year call Ms. Warwick's friends.
But couch potatoes aren't the only people seeking the counsel of psychics and astrologers. Clairvoyants have a booming business advising Philadelphia bankers, Hollywood lawyers and CEO's of Fortune 500 companies, whom they charge between $100 and $250 an hour. 
 "If people knew how many people, especially the very rich and powerful ones, went to psychics, their jaws would drop through the floor," said Rosanna Rogers, a psychic from Cleveland who claims to have 4,000 names in her Rolodex. "But we know Nancy Reagan, she had an astrologer, and John Lennon and H. L. Hunt and J. P. Morgan used psychics. Morgan, you know, he said, 'Millionaires don't use psychics, billionaires do.' "
In these increasingly complex and economically uncertain times, where bet-hedging and fence-straddling are considered wisdom, devotees say soothsayers are one of the last groups that provide simple answers. Call it pragmatic spiritualism. Rather than focus on a client's soul, these clairvoyants say point blank whether a business deal is good or bad, or predict precisely when the market will rise or fall or pinpoint the exact day love will walk through the front door or sneak out the back.
 
Getting a Reading
 "My psychic tells me the truth as she sees it, as opposed to what I want to hear," said Denise Laine, who owns American Transitech, which refills toner cartridges in Mountain View, Calif. "She makes specific suggestions about what I should do."
When Judy McCutchan, who owns a direct mail service in Sunnyvale, Calif., showed her psychic photos of her employees, "she told me my sales manager was going to quit and move to Santa Fe," she recalled. "A few weeks later she quit and moved to Santa Fe."
Dr. Paul Kurtz, chairman of the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, in Buffalo, N.Y., called such predictions "cheap carnival tricks." His committee, which includes several Nobel laureates, has investigated hundreds of clairvoyants and has yet to find a system or individual capable of telling the future. What it has found is that fortune tellers are experts at reading body language, listening closely and making general statements that seem specific. Many people, he added, are so suggestible they make their fortunes come true.
"At heart I think the problem is that Americans are so scientifically illiterate that they do not understand that these things are impossible," he said. "And they want to believe in it, so they will."
Clairvoyants say their art is so arcane that even they do not know precisely how it works. And psychics, astrologers and hybrid psychic-astrologers are quick to denounce one another as not completely legitimate.
Despite all the evidence to the contrary, astrologers cling to the ancient belief that the planets affect people and their environment and that by examining planetary motions, they can tell the past, present and future. Psychics, on the other hand, act like human radios, tuning in to the clients' karmic wavelengths to divine their lives. They claim to "read" almost anything including financial markets, corporations and entire nations.
Arch Crawford, a New York City financial astrologer who predicted the 1987 crash in his newsletter, Crawford Perspectives, began using sunspot activity and astrology to chart the stock and commodities markets while working as an analyst at Merrill Lynch because he found traditional econometric models frustrating. "While markets have become extremely complex in recent years, statistical tools for tracking them have not become equally sophisticated," Mr. Crawford said. So why not try magic instead? "Astrology, along with a lot of technical analysis, gives me an edge over those people who simply rely on numbers."
Psychics and astrologers predict their growing popularity augurs the return of their once exalted position. Beginning with the Assyrians 5,000 years ago, soothsayers were prized advisers. For lack of anything better, their art was considered good science -- Plato and Aristotle were practicing astrologers as were Copernicus, Galileo and Newton. But the rise of Reason during the 17th and 18th centuries began the soothsayers' slide from reverence to ridicule.
Still, no amount of debunking is sufficient to extinguish these beliefs. "People have always known that there are other ways of being and knowing," said Dr. Glenn Perry, a psychotherapist from San Rafael, Calif., who publishes the Journal of Astropsychology, "and now it is becoming more acceptable to rediscover them."
For profit, when possible.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Peace Deal Today Really Is a Bargain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MORE than 200 years ago, the economist Adam Smith wrote about how the "invisible hand" of the free market produced certain unexpected beneficial economic effects. Watching how peace has unexpectedly broken out in the Middle East, South Africa and even Northern Ireland in the last 12 months, one is tempted to ask whether Adam Smith's invisible hand isn't busy producing certain beneficial political effects as well.
Is it simply a coincidence that the three most irreconcilable ethnic conflicts on the face of the earth have all taken giant steps toward reconciliation at the same time? Or have Afrikaners and black South Africans, Arabs and Jews, Protestants and Catholics all been compelled to beat their swords into plowshares simultaneously by economic forces acting on each of them in different ways? 
 The short answer is that there is something to this argument. Changes in the global economy have helped crack all three of these conflicts. But no one should assume that we are now entering an era when passion and politics will inexorably yield to economics. Forget that "end of history" stuff, because in some unanticipated ways the marketplace may also be sharpening ethnic tensions as well.
But first the good news. The Middle East, South Africa and Northern Ireland were profoundly affected by two fundamental economic events at polar ends of the earth. They were, crudely speaking, the fall of Moscow and the rise of Singapore.
The collapse of the Soviet Union, which was at root an economic event -- millions of people demanding free markets and participation in the global trading system -- had a huge impact on the Middle East. The end of Soviet economic aid to the Palestinians and the loss of economic assistance from other Arab states as punishment for the Palestinians' support of Iraq combined to deprive Yasir Arafat of the guns, butter and pocket money he needed to meet his payroll and maintain his leadership. It is no accident that on the eve of his historic agreement with Israel, Mr. Arafat was flat broke.
 
The Gravy Train
 The collapse of the Soviet Union also suddenly flooded Israel with 1 million Soviet Jews in need of jobs, housing and education, which made Israel more vulnerable to economic pressure from the Bush Administration to open a dialogue with the Palestinians. These economic pressures were the necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to consider the unthinkable -- mutual recognition.
In South Africa, the collapse of the Soviet Union enabled whites to look at the African National Congress not as a stalking horse for Communism, as it had been viewed for decades, but as a nationalist movement that could be accommodated politically without committing suicide economically. The bankruptcy of communism as an ideology also prompted the A.N.C. to stop talking about nationalizing industries, which made power sharing with the whites much more possible.
But it was not only negative changes but positive changes in the international economy that helped lure these parties into reconciliation. Israel, South Africa and even Northern Ireland all have skilled, educated work forces -- not unlike those of Singapore or Taiwan. There is no way an increasingly bourgeois Israeli society could read every day about the phenomenal growth rates in Singapore or Thailand without asking themselves: "What are we doing wasting our time putting up caravan homes on hardscrabble hills in the West Bank?" There was an intuitive understanding that a gravy train was passing them by.
It was also no accident that it was the white business community in South Africa making the first contacts with the A.N.C., because it understood not only the harmful effects to South Africa of the economic boycott against it but also the opportunity that was being lost by isolation from an increasingly integrated economy. President Nelson Mandela was heard berating South African trade unions just last week to stop going on strike so often, to behave more like workers in Asia.
"The huge success of developing countries in Asia has created certain highly positive visions of the benefits of getting your economic house in order that are much greater than ever existed before," remarked Lawrence H. Summers, Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Economics. "It used to be that capital did not move much across international borders. Even if your economy was booming, you couldn't get much. Now if your economy is booming you can get a lot. Global markets reward good economic performance and punish bad economic performance more quickly than ever. Twenty years ago, the Arabs and Israelis could have made peace and their hopes of getting any international investment would have been slim. Today, six months of good stabilization policies in Russia and you see real foreign money moving in."
The value of a peace accord used to be measured by the number of lives saved; now it's also measured by the number of jobs created. Consider two items in last week's news from Northern Ireland. One was a story that Hilton International has decided to build a $26.3 million hotel in the middle of Belfast, the first major dividend from the cease-fire declared by the Irish Republican Army in its conflict with British forces. The other was a story about the Mackie International factory in Belfast, where Protestant and Catholic workers, each arriving through different gates, have been cooperating to revive the ailing manufacturing firm. In what could be the quote of the year, Paddy Auld, a Catholic plant supervisor, said: "One thing that people in all sections of the community are finding out is that if you lose your job it doesn't matter what religion you are."
Prosperity can be a peacemaker in other ways as well. Malaysia has the sort of diverse ethnic population that makes it as likely a candidate for internal conflict as any in the world. "But it has been able to manage those conflicts with a gross national product doubling every eight years," said Mr. Summers, "whereas ethnic conflicts in Africa have increased in recent years, as economic performance has continued to be disappointing."
Moreover, he added, both World War I and the Pacific war with Japan started to some degree because German and Japanese economic expansion could not be accommodated by the regional and global economic systems of their day. Room was not made for them, so they tried to muscle in in other ways. One of the hidden benefits of today's liberalized trading system is that it has expanded to embrace rising economic powers like Japan and Singapore without conflict. That is something for the United States to keep in mind as it considers whether to let China and Russia join the recently negotiated world trading regime, and how many conditions to impose on them for entry.
 
The Dark Side
 But there is another side to the global economy. Yugoslavia had all the Hilton hotels a country could want and this did not guarantee internal peace. Indeed, to some extent the changing world economy can also sharpen ethnic conflicts in this sense: The more people are asked to integrate with distant, impersonal economic structures, the more they want to assert their own particular local or national identity. The more the world beckons from one side, the louder the call of the tribe, the family, the neighborhood from the other.
In South Africa, the Middle East and Northern Ireland, it is clear that a majority of people felt that the question of personal identity was overwhelming the opportunities and demands of the global marketplace and that a different balance had to be struck. In Yugoslavia, it seems that a yearning to make up for years of suppressed personal identity is, for the moment, overriding the lure of the global economy. The trick is to find the right balance. That seems to be what Jews and Arabs, Protestants and Catholics, black and white South Africans are groping for and what the former Yugoslavs have not even begun to find.

HEADLINE: U.S.-CUBA ACCORD SETS OFF A SURGE OF NEW REFUGEES

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAS BRISAS, Cuba, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The tide of people fleeing Cuba surged again today as hundreds rushed to beat a 72-hour deadline set by the Government after its agreement with the United States to halt the exodus.
Cuban Coast Guard officers in green fatigues patrolled the shore on foot, but seemed to be making little effort to block the motley procession of homemade vessels into the sea. 
 Though the Government announced that it would begin at noon today to urge people not to leave, many of those on the beach said they were told by the Coast Guard that they would have until midday on Tuesday to shove off.
After that, the authorities said, they would stop the rafts by force if necessary. "Nonetheless," the Government said in a statement published today by the Communist Party newspaper Granma, "persuasion will always be the fundamental method employed."
[In Washington, State Department officials reacted cautiously to Cuba's gradual approach to enforcing the accord, which was signed in New York on Friday after eight days of negotiation.
["The agreement started yesterday," said the chief American negotiator in the talks, Michael Skol, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. "We expect that actions will take place right away. We are going to have to judge this based on actual numbers of people who are picked up."]
Throughout much of the afternoon and evening on Friday, rain, wind and choppy seas appeared to limit both the departure of rafts and their rescue by United States Coast Guard ships waiting at the boundary of international waters.
After 610 Cubans were picked up by the Coast Guard on Thursday, only 177 were rescued on Friday.
But by 9 P.M., however, today's total was 447, and was expected to rise as scores of rafts that had left after the agreement was announced on television and radio news programs here floated beyond the 12-mile limit of Cuban waters.
United States officials emphasized on Friday that would-be immigrants detained at American military bases in Panama and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would have to return home to apply for entry into the United States.
Still, it seemed to remain an article of faith along the shores east of Havana that being picked up by the United States Coast Guard and taken to Guantanamo would mean some sort of priority on the list of people seeking to immigrate.
"The people who are going to get in are the ones who get to Guantanamo," said Guillermo Vega, 30 years old, an automobile mechanic who was preparing to leave from this beach town aboard a rickety platform floated by some empty oil drums and festooned with a banner calling it "The Miraculous One."
"The people who stay are going to have to apply to God," he said.
Under the terms of the accord, the Government of President Fidel Castro is obliged to "take effective measures in every way it possibly can to prevent unsafe departures, using mainly persuasive methods."
In the past, the Cuban authorities generally punished people trying to leave the island by raft with jail sentences or stiff fines. But as it did briefly in 1965 and 1980, the Government suddenly lifted the ban last month after the hijackings of several state-owned vessels and a riot against the security forces near the port of Havana on Aug. 5.
In what Granma called an "exhortation" to the citizenry today, the Government called on Cubans who have built or are building rafts to disassemble them, gather up the materials and put them to some other use.
"We do not want to arrest anyone or confiscate belongings or materials," it said.
 
Emphasis on Persuasion
 The statement added that Cuban negotiators had proposed the language in the accord that called for an emphasis on persuasion, and that Government agents would not fire on anyone trying to leave the island unless they were attacked and their safety endangered. In another statement, the Interior Ministry said this evening that it would arrest anyone caught transporting rafts to the coast after 6 A.M. Sunday.
Some diplomats and other observers have been skeptical that Cuban officials will be able to easily reimpose their control over the coastline after the flight of some 30,000 people since last month. As he watched half a dozen large rafts preparing to put to sea this morning, a uniformed Interior Ministry major at Las Brisas seemed somewhat uncertain about that himself.
"Let's see how people behave," the officer, who did not give his name, said of those seeking to leave.
In remarks on Friday, Cuban officials suggested that the agreement was as important as a step toward normalizing Cuba's relations with the United States as it was as a framework for limiting undocumented migration. Mr. Castro and other officials have argued that unless the United States lifts its 32-year-old embargo on the island, desperate Cubans will continue trying to escape the economic crisis that began with the collapse of the Soviet bloc and its preferential trade with Cuba.
 
Cuba Vows Compliance
 Reflecting Cuba's hopes to build on the accord, the Government's statement today described Cuban compliance with the deal as "essential" in order to show the American public "that we are a serious, disciplined and dignified country that knows how to and will comply with its commitments."
The immediate focus of Cuban diplomatic attention appeared to be on the new restrictions that President Clinton imposed on Aug. 20 on Americans wishing to travel to the island and Cuban-Americans who want to send dollars to their relatives here.
In an interview on Friday night on Cuban state television, the Government's chief negotiator in New York, former Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon, described the measures as incompatible with the spirit of the immigration agreement. "We hope for and are confident that these measures will be overcome in a more or less short period," he said.
At least some Cubans seem to share their Government's optimism.
"I have to hope that the agreement will make things better," said Roberto Lopez, 66, a resident of the coastal town of Cojimar who supports Mr. Castro but had just watched his stepson and son-in-law push off to sea aboard a raft. "Cuba is practically not Communist anymore, because the Communist bloc disappeared. What fear can the United States have of Cuba?"
 
Pessimism at the Beach
 But along the coast such views appeared to be in short supply.
"I would rather be locked up in Guantanamo than here with Fidel," said Juan Carlos Ordonez, 22, from the interior of Havana Province who was preparing to board a small, homemade raft at Cojimar. "I love this country -- I am Cuban -- but you cannot live here anymore."
Mr. Ordonez said he hoped to join his brother, Reynaldo, who was a shortstop on the Cuban national baseball team until he defected last year during the World University Games in Buffalo. Rey Ordonez was signed by the Mets and now plays for the team's Class AA minor-league team in Binghamton, N.Y.
Even if he were able to get a United States visa, Mr. Ordonez told a reporter, the Cuban Government would prevent him from leaving because he had not completed his obligatory military service. He was also discouraged by the inability of his sister-in-law, Lisa Maria de Ordonez, to get a visa to join her husband.
Waist-deep in the waves, a woman shouted at Mr. Ordonez to get a move on. "Juan Carlos! Let's go! Let's go! They can interview you when you get to Miami."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI PROPOSES TOUGHENING LAWS ON X-RATED SHOPS

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Saying New York City had to do more to protect its quality of life, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed sweeping new zoning regulations yesterday that would restrict sex-oriented video stores, X-rated theaters and topless bars to a few relatively isolated nonresidential neighborhoods.
The Mayor's proposal, which must now go through a lengthy review process, would prohibit such establishments from opening within 500 feet of residences, schools, houses of worship or one another. In effect, the restrictions would push them to the city's fringes, even forcing out almost all of those in Times Square. 
 Existing shops, theaters or bars in the newly restricted areas would, under the proposal, be allowed to remain open for an as-yet-unspecified time to allow owners to recoup their investment. The Mayor also proposed an immediate moratorium on the opening of new sex-oriented businesses anywhere in the city while his proposals are considered.
The plan is subject to approval by the City Council, where similar, though less far-reaching legislation has found wide support. But civil libertarians and owners of adult businesses expressed opposition yesterday, and the plan will likely face challenges.
With his proposal, Mr. Giuliani has tapped a welling anger over the proliferation of adult video stores and topless bars in neighborhoods where they had rarely been before -- from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to Rego Park in Queens. In the last decade, the number of such businesses has risen 35 percent, from 131 in 1984 to 177 as of last December.
Appearing before an adult video store in Queens, where new shops have met vociferous protests for more than a year, Mr. Giuliani said the city needed "reasonable regulations" to halt the spread of "sex shops" in places where New Yorkers and their children live.
The stores "have deteriorated the quality of life in the city," said Mr. Giuliani, who made "quality of life" a mantra of his two campaigns. "They hurt the economy of the city. They cost us jobs. They cost us money."
The United States Supreme Court, as well as lower state courts, have long held that sexually explicit videos, books and dancing are forms of free speech protected under the First Amendment -- provided they do not fall under the strict legal definition of obscenity. The courts, however, have allowed municipalities to restrict adult businesses through zoning regulations as long as officials demonstrate harmful "secondary impacts" from their presence and do not onerously reduce their accessibility.
A number of cities, including Detroit, Boston, St. Louis, Los Angeles and the town of Islip, L.I., have adopted various restrictions in recent years -- either by confining them to "red light" districts or dispersing them to prevent such concentrations.
Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said yesterday that the Mayor's zoning changes could prove too restrictive to pass muster in court. He said Mr. Giuliani's proposal was "a radical departure" from the city's tradition of fostering freedom of expression, even when sexually explicit.
"The Giuliani administration is trying to impose its morality, or the morality of one part of the city, over all of the city," he said.
In the 1970's, when the number of adult businesses had grown from 9 in 1965 to 151 in 1976 before tapering off slightly in the 1980's, similar legislation withered under intense opposition from liberals as well as residents in neighborhoods where the shops would still be allowed.
But while some elected officials have expressed misgivings about restrictions, the new proposal appears likely to pass through the Council. Already, two pieces of legislation to restrict adult businesses have been embraced by officials across the political spectrum, with 48 of the Council's 51 members signing on as sponsors of one of the bills, including the Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.
The city's zoning laws now treat adult businesses like any other business, permitting them to open in any area zoned for commercial or manufacturing uses. Under the Mayor's proposal, the laws would be amended to impose for the first time restrictions on adult stores -- defined by the Department of City Planning as book or video shops, theaters or topless bars that advertise themselves as sexually explicit.
 
Effects of the Plan
 In effect, the changes would put wide swaths of the city's residential neighborhoods off limits. In Manhattan, for example, the businesses would be allowed only in areas along the West Side Highway below 59th Street and in small commercial pockets in midtown and Washington Heights. In Queens, they would be banished to remote, largely industrial areas such as those in Long Island City and along Newtown Creek.
 
Expecting Challenges
 Richard N. Kunis, the owner of Manhattan Video on West 39th Street, which has sold adult videos since 1985, said the proposal amounted to the repression of free speech.
"Limiting access is the beginning of censorship," he said. "Until now New York has always been a censorship-free city."
Mr. Giuliani predicted that his proposed restrictions would withstand political and legal challenges. He said each aspect of his proposal had been enacted in other cities and upheld in court. "There are legal challenges to everything," he said. "That's O.K."
Joseph B. Rose, the director of the Department of City Planning, said the administration would try to impose the moratorium by the end of the year, speeding it through the review process, which begins with the borough presidents and Community Boards, then moves through the Planning Commission and ends in the Council. Final approval of the zoning changes could take a year or more.
In announcing his proposal, Mr. Giuliani also released a 65-page report by the Department of City Planning on the impact adult businesses have on neighborhoods. The Mayor and his aides said the study showed enough negative "secondary impacts" -- as required by the courts -- to warrant the restrictions.
The department's study, which began last year under Mayor David N. Dinkins, focused on sexually oriented stores and bars in six areas -- Chelsea and the Upper West Side in Manhattan, Fordham in the Bronx, Sunset Park in Brooklyn, Sunnyside in Queens and South Beach on Staten Island. Generally, the report deals less with actual effects and more with the perceptions of residents and merchants, who, the report concludes, overwhelmingly felt that the businesses were harmful.
Specifically, the report notes that blocks with adult shops sometimes recorded more criminal complaints than blocks without them. But the report says crime on such blocks could have as much to do with the proximity of, say, a subway station. "It was not possible to isolate the impact of adult uses relative to criminal complaints," the report says.
Andrew S. Lynn, the department's executive director, said court rulings allowed the city to rely on experiences of other cities and findings of other studies, including ones by Ruth W. Messinger, the Borough President of Manhattan, and the Times Square Business Improvement District.
But after reading the report yesterday, Mr. Siegel of the Civil Liberties Union said the city had failed to show the impacts. "It's not persuasive," he said.
 
Plan Is Welcomed
 Others welcomed the Mayor's proposal. Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, said the provision to bar adult businesses from opening within 500 feet of one another would prevent them from clustering into the sort of "red light" district that has made Times Square notorious.
The Mayor chose to announce his proposal in Queens, where the shops have proliferated more rapidly than anywhere else in recent years, reaching into middle-class neighborhoods and provoking fears that their garish "XXX" signs would attract seedy characters, drugs and prostitution.
"These places are opening up in my district faster than McDonald's and Burger King," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, the primary sponsor of legislation that would restrict topless bars from residential neighborhoods but not go as far as Mr. Giuliani's proposal.
In a show of support, Mr. Giuliani stood beside Mr. McCaffrey and several other elected officials in front of the Ultimate Choice, a video store on Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst only a stone's throw from the Elks Lodge and shaded rows of neat homes.
Mr. Giuliani said he would work with the Council, which is scheduled to hold a hearing on its legislation tomorrow. Councilman Charles Millard of Manhattan, the Republican who is the sponsor of legislation to restrict video stores, said the restrictions balanced protections of free speech with protections for residents.
"Nobody," Mr. Millard said, "wants their neighborhood to be the next red light district."

HEADLINE: Freewheeling Ways Pay Off for the White House

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration was able to claim a triumph Friday in its talks with Cuba, although its policy-making process on the immigration crisis was undisciplined and untidy even by the Administration's freewheeling bureaucratic standards.
Many Administration officials acknowledge that the last five weeks of policy-making on Cuba have been marked to an unusual degree by ad-libbing, domestic politics and a constantly changing cast of characters. Adding to the confusion, several new voices on foreign policy were involved because the Cuba crisis so heavily involved immigration matters and because so many officials were on vacation. 
 Despite the bureaucratic messiness, the Administration was still able to get exactly what it wanted in its talks in New York with the Cubans: Havana's promise to end the flow of boats and rafts. Administration officials said the reason for their success was that all the potentially contradictory veins of American policies agreed on one point: trying to make the crisis Fidel Castro's.
 
Turning the Tables
 Mr. Castro unleashed the flow of boat people with the aim of throwing President Clinton on the defensive and pressuring him to ease the three-decade-old embargo. But Administration officials boast that they turned the tables on the Cuban leader by their decision to stop admitting boat people and to tighten the embargo.
This dual strategy was driven largely by domestic politics: specifically, to appease Floridians worried about a surge of refugees and to please Cuban-Americans who constantly favor turning up the heat on Mr. Castro. But Administration officials recognized early on that this strategy dovetailed neatly with their goal of pressuring Mr. Castro to clamp down on the flow of refugees.
"We decided we weren't going to play Castro's game," a senior State Department official said. "We took him by surprise when we decided to stop allowing in Cuban refugees."
But that decision also took some members of the Administration by surprise. This is because, in a little-understood chapter of the Cuba crisis, the Administration shunted aside its main Cuba contingency plan and started ad-libbing.
In its first few months in office, the Clinton Administration put together an emergency plan to deal with a flood of Cuban refugees in case a flotilla of rafts began drifting toward Florida. The classified plan, known as Operation Distant Shore, called for distributing thousands of Cuban refugees to forts and other Federal sites around the nation so Florida would not be overwhelmed.
 
Abandoning the Plan
 But at a pivotal White House meeting on Aug. 18, with the wave of Cubans growing, that emergency plan was pushed aside. Instead, Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Attorney General Janet Reno and State Department and White House officials recommended to the President that he end the three-decade-old practice of admitting all Cubans and instead send Cuban boat people to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station.
That recommendation came just hours after Florida's Governor, Lawton Chiles, declared a state of emergency and warned President Clinton that he would order Florida officials to detain all Cuban boat people. Back at the White House, policy makers were mindful of Mr. Chiles's plight, recognizing that a tidal wave of boat people not only could cripple the Democratic Governor in a tough re-election campaign this fall, but could spoil Mr. Clinton's chances in Florida, the fourth-most populous state, in the 1996 Presidential campaign.
Even though the United States was in a diplomatic showdown with Mr. Castro, an unusually large role fell to Attorney General Reno, who used to be Dade County prosecutor.
"Early on, she wore two hats: her Florida hat -- she was the most knowledgeable person about Florida politics -- and her Department of Justice-overseer of immigration hat," a senior Administration official said.
 
Vacations and Policy
 Because both Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, were on vacation during most of the second half of August, large policy roles fell to two other officials.
Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser, was the behind-the-scenes crisis manager. Then, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, a long-time student of Cuba, became his department's point man in the crisis. As a special assistant to Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance during the Carter Administration, he held secret talks in Havana aimed at normalizing relations with Cuba.
Several officials said Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, had a strong hand in Cuba policy as he made sure political considerations were not forgotten.
Administration officials say their decision to stop admitting Cuban refugees was key to their ability to resist pressures from Mr. Castro. If they had followed their original contingency plan and distributed refugees around the nation, that might have encouraged Mr. Castro to turn up the faucet even more.
 
'No More Mariels'
 According to Mr. Clinton's advisers, two mottos animated the President's thinking. One was "No More Mariels." With anti-immigrant sentiment growing nationwide, he did not want a replay of the 1980 Mariel boatlift in which 125,000 Cubans swarmed into the United States, contributing to President Carter's loss in the 1980 elections.
The second motto was "Remember Fort Chaffee." Bill Clinton lost his race for re-election as Arkansas Governor in 1980 partly because Cuban refugees rioted at that Arkansas fort. Several military police were injured and hundreds of Cuban escaped, before being captured.
The decision to turn away Cubans pleased Florida officials, but it angered many Cuban-American groups. To placate them, President Clinton told Cuban-American leaders on Aug. 19 of his plans to step up sanctions against Cuba, including tighter restrictions on travel and a ban on almost all remittances to Cuba.
To some officials, that was a sharp lurch away from the longstanding recommendations of several low- and mid-level officials. In their view, the best way to promote a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba is to increase, not decrease, the flow of Western ideas to Cuba, and that means increasing travel, telecommunications and student exchanges.
"This was a self-coup against our own policy," one Administration official said. Indeed, several officials said the ban on remittances went too far and might be adjusted soon. One change under consideration would be aimed at helping Cuban dissidents who have been kept alive by remittances from American relatives.
When the wave of refugees surged in mid-August, the Administration feared that it would be overwhelmed and might be forced to make concessions to Mr. Castro. But by the time talks began on Sept. 1, Administration officials were confident they held the stronger hand.
 
Embarrassment for Castro
 President Clinton won some room to maneuver by doubling Guantanamo's capacity to hold refugees and by persuading Panama and Honduras to take up to 15,000 Cubans. And while the refugee flow created big inconveniences for Washington, Administration officials said it had backfired for Mr. Castro, becoming such an embarrassment that he needed a deal to defuse the crisis more than President Clinton did.
So the Cubans signed an agreement that did not mention the embargo. The Administration promised to grant entry to at least 20,000 Cubans a year, and Mr. Castro pledged in return to stop the boat people.
According to several officials, Mr. Castro approved the agreement in an effort to earn some good will in the hope that the Administration would pursue the route recommended by mid-level officials: increased openness toward Cuba.
On Friday, Mr. Tarnoff signaled that Cuban-American relations could indeed follow a new path. He said, "If there are significant steps towards democracy, free-market economy and human rights in Cuba, the United States will respond with carefully calibrated measures of its own."

HEADLINE: Town Finds Rare Way To Protect Farms: Tax

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OLD MISSION, Mich., Sept. 10

 BODY:
The loss of scenic farm land to real estate development is a familiar story across much of the nation's rural landscape. But here on Old Mission Peninsula, where Center Road winds through cherry orchards and vineyards above the striking blue expanse of Grand Traverse Bay, a community has taken an extraordinary step in an effort to halt the trend.
For more than 100 years, the peninsula's long frost-free growing season and its sandy loam soils have supported a thriving farm economy. Roughly half the $14 million fruit harvest of far larger Grand Traverse County comes from this 16-mile-long spit of land, no more than 3 miles wide at any point, near the top of Lake Michigan. 
 But the same union of climate and terrain that made this one of the nation's premier fruit-growing areas has also brought a lively real estate market. The population of the peninsula, just north of Traverse City, has swelled to more than 6,000, 20 percent more than in 1990, bringing increased demand for housing and services.
Last month the voters of Peninsula Township, which stretches the entire length of the peninsula, opted for a novel approach to protect not only farm land but also a way of life. Acting counter to national anti-tax sentiment, they narrowly approved a property tax increase that will raise at least $2.6 million, and perhaps much more, over the next 15 years.
The tax increase, an extra $81 a year on a $130,000 home, will be used to preserve thousands of acres of orchards and farm fields by paying growers not to sell to developers -- indeed, not to use their land for anything but farming.
This is the first time a Midwest community has embraced new taxes specifically to protect its farm economy and rural landscape, said Ralph Grossi, executive director of American Farmland Trust, a preservation group in Washington.
Mr. Grossi and other land preservation advocates said the vote reflected changing priorities.
"We have found in our work around the country that the public is developing a more mature attitude about what's important in the environment," said Mr. Grossi, whose 14-year-old group helped design the Old Mission Peninsula program. "The public is becoming more leery about the latest environmental toxic scare of the week. They are looking at more fundamental issues, such as the long-term protection of open space. Those are the things that are part of their quality of life."
The program on Old Mission Peninsula will offer farmers cash payments, to be distributed to them over 15 years, for the development rights to their land. The price of the development rights will be the difference between the land's value for agriculture and its value for housing.
The program will enable the farmer to continue to own the land while giving the township permanent authority to prevent its development.
Gordon Hayward, a former dairy farmer who is the township's planner, said that in most cases the development rights to a cherry orchard with views of the bay would cost the township roughly $1,800 an acre.
Mr. Hayward said he expected the township to buy the development rights to at least 2,000 of the peninsula's 9,000 acres of farm land. The township is also working with state and private groups to buy development rights to thousands more acres.
The campaign to enact the measure was led by Rob Manigold, a 43-year-old cherry farmer who is the township supervisor. Mr. Manigold was elected in 1988 on his promise of effective management of the peninsula's surging growth. At the time, interest rates were beginning to fall, and builders had begun planning immense housing subdivisions, golf courses and other developments.
Mr. Manigold hired Mr. Hayward, a professional planner, and the two men went to work with the town planning commission to develop a master plan for the peninsula. The plan specified the most valuable farm land, places where views of the bay should be protected and locations where housing would most readily fit in.
Perhaps the most crucial argument for the preservation plan was Mr. Hayward's assertion that the township's expenses would soar as population increased. He said his analysis of state tax and population data showed that the per-capita expense to run a township of 10,000 would be nearly $200 a year, twice the township's current cost.
Those extra costs would be in higher expenses for road maintenance, police protection and other services that are now provided largely by the state and the county, neither of which would be eager to pick up the higher tab for a booming township.
So higher costs, of course, would mean higher taxes. As a result, Mr. Hayward and Mr. Manigold made the case to voters that spending a little extra in taxes now might save a lot in taxes later.
"We don't want to be flagged as anti-growth, because we're not," Mr. Manigold said in an interview in the tiny white town hall. "We want to keep our scenic views. We want to keep the natural farm resource, which has national significance. And we want to move the development into locations where we can have the best for everybody."
 
Hardly Unanimous
 Not everybody here is satisfied with the program. The close vote in early August -- 1,208 to 1,081 -- was a clear indication that the preservation effort had not been an easy sell.
A total of 137 families now farm on the peninsula, and some are suspicious of the plan, predicting that it will fail to control growth because land has simply become too valuable.
Up and down Center Road, "for sale" signs are staked out in orchards, one of which belongs to 57-year-old Russell J. Holmes, who is asking $434,000 for his 79 acres and their magnificent view of the bay.
Mr. Holmes, who would get $140,000 if he accepted a development-rights payment from the township, said: "This preservation program is a day late and a dollar short. You've already got too many people out here. What gets me now is that my taxes are going up to pay for it."
But other farmers say they support the program because it will add to the income from their land without requiring them to give up ownership or farming.
The debate over land use is by no means unique to Old Mission Peninsula. In many rural communities, the most pressing environmental issues of the 1980's -- hazardous wastes, and toxic chemicals in air and water -- are being nudged aside by more immediate problems. Two years ago a state study identified the deterioriating rural landscape as the top environmental issue in Michigan.
The principal reason for the change in attitude, public officials say, has been the success of the air and water pollution laws enacted since the early 1970's. The Great Lakes region is much cleaner than it was a generation ago, according to findings announced at several scientific conferences this year.
But the cleaner environment also attracts more residents. The Traverse City metropolitan region, for instance, now has more than 64,000 people, an increase of almost 20 percent since 1980. Glen Chown, the executive director of the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy, said in an interview that the growth was fueling new housing subdivisions, shopping centers and roads on land that only a few years ago was forests and fields.
"The irony," he said, "is that the natural beauty that attracted all the growth is itself now threatened."

HEADLINE: For Black-Owned Businesses, a Directory of Their Own

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Let your fingers do the walking in the Black Pages, and those fingers will find themselves on the pulse of an often unacknowledged world.
"It's the world of black businesses owned by black people," said Celeste Morris. "Word of mouth was how black people in New York used to find those businesses. Now part of that world is in these pages." 
 Ms. Morris, 44, is the founder and publisher of New York City's Black Pages, formally known as "The Big Black Book." The 1994 edition, the eighth, circulation 75,000, has 137 pages with more than 500 display ads in categories from psychotherapists to locksmiths. It sells for $1 at 60 distributors citywide, including stores and nonprofit agencies.
According to a report last month by the University of Georgia, blacks' spending power is expected to reach $399 billion by 1995, up 33.9 percent from 1990, compared with a 29.6 increase projected for the country as a whole. A large chunk of those billions is spent in New York City, which has about 25,000 black-owned businesses.
"But you have to find each other to spend money on each other," said Ms. Morris, also the president of the Black Pages Publishers Association. More than two dozen other cities have equivalents of the Big Black Book. The Black Pages of Atlanta has been publishing for nearly two decades.
Ms. Morris, a native of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, was working for the Transit Authority in 1986 when she decided the city could use a Yellow Pages for black businesses. She pushed her idea 24 hours a day, working craft fairs on weekends and dance floors by night.
She sold 200 ads and stored all the copy in a cardboard box under her desk. Then the box was taken out with the trash. After a frantic dawn search at the Greenpoint dump, the targeted truck was yanked off the disposal line, and its contents were spread out in front of Ms. Morris. Sanitation workers helped tear open bags. The box was uncovered.
Eventually, the 200 ads became 400, then peaked at 700 in 1992 before settling to the current 500. Ms. Morris's offices, once located in her son's bedroom, now take up a floor of a Brooklyn brownstone. She employs a staff of three, with 10 independent ad salespeople. Space in the book, whose cover is always the work of a black artist, runs from $275 to $3,000.
"I always had faith in the book," said Elenora Willis, the president of Gem Travel in Queens, who has advertised since the book's debut. "Black businesses were suffering, and its time had come."
Jeffrey Watts, who runs Pro Tech Locksmith in Flatbush, Brooklyn, said: "I wasn't looking at the political side of it when I took out the first ad. I was looking for business. It's worked out well.
"If you need a locksmith and it's 3 A.M. and you live in East New York, there aren't a lot of shops that are going to send someone to you," he added. "But we'll go.."
Ms. Morris's next ambition is a black business institute, a center for the research and advocacy of African-American enterprise.
"Years ago, one of the downsides of integration was that it helped the demise of many black business," she said. "But the Big Black Book is a testament to the creativity of black people, to the tenaciousness of black people. People can say what they want about blacks and business and initiative, but they can't argue with this book."

HEADLINE: Cairo Parley Hits a New Snag on Migrants

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 10

 BODY:
After six days of snail's-pace maneuvering over abortion, the United Nations population conference ran into fresh problems tonight when developing nations revolted over the refusal of the United States to agree that migrants have a right to be united with their families.
People taking part in the gathering said about 60 delegates from Latin America and other parts of the developing world rose in a closed committee meeting to protest the American move, which assumed added significance in light of the recent flood of Cuban and Haitian refugees seeking to reach the United States. Many of the Cubans in particular are seeking to join relatives. 
 A senior conference official reported that agreement was close on a number of other issues discussed in the conference's final document, including abortion. But in an unanticipated hitch, several Muslim groups and governments were objecting to language in the 113-page declaration that they felt would sanction homosexuality and sexual permissiveness. Vatican diplomats also indicated that the debate over abortion was far from over.
"I feel rather saddened after a lot of work was done," said Fred Sei, the chairman of the conference's main drafting committee. "I hate to end this meeting on such a despondent note."
 
Immigration Flood Feared
 The new deadlock arose because of longstanding American opposition to a sentence in the conference's draft declaration recognizing "the right to family reunification," a clause that the United States fears would lead to a flood of immigration.
"The whole thing still needs a lot of examination," said an Argentine diplomat, arguing that by excising the contested clause, the principle of family reunification for migrants would be jeopardized.
The contentious language comes in Chapter 10 of a 113-page draft declaration that the conference hopes will serve as a blueprint for nations confronting a looming population crisis. The strategies for limiting population growth include a range of new initiatives in health, education, family planning and the empowerment of women.
While the final declaration to be formally adopted when the conference closes next Tuesday is nonbinding on governments, many delegations are seeking the widest possible consensus so its recommendations will be as authoritative as possible.
The disputed paragraph says, among other things, "Governments of receiving countries must insure the protection of migrants and their families, and recognize the right to family reunification." Under the United Nations policy for registering objections to a text, the United States sought to have parentheses around the words, "and recognize the right to family reunification."
 
Surprised by Vehemence
 An American official said the language was completely unacceptable but acknowledged that the newest objections to Washington's position had been surprisingly vehement. While American diplomats did not address the closed committee meeting, the official said, the United States position was that American legislation already provides for the reunification of migrant families.
European and other participants also said the revolt had come as a surprise. "At 7:30 we thought we had agreement," said an official of the 12-nation European Union. "An hour later, we did not."
The fierceness of the protest persuaded Mr. Sei to postpone the committee sessions until Monday, participants said.
Sunday was initially scheduled as a day of rest for the delegates from more than 150 countries. But European officials said the day would now be spent in more of the closed-door maneuvering that generally dominates such gatherings.
The development shifted the focus of the debate here, which has centered on the Vatican's opposition to language in the final document that it said implies a universal right to abortion.
After forcing many changes, the Vatican agreed on Friday to suspend its objections to one section on abortion. Delegates devoted much time today to changing proposals in another chapter relating to abortion and sexual rights to address the Vatican's concerns.
 
Vatican Resistance Expected
 Nicolaas Biegman of the Netherlands, the deputy chairman of the drafting committee, acknowledged that the revised language was still expected to meet with Vatican resistance but would nonetheless be put before his committee on Monday.
"Then I will bang my gavel," he said, meaning that he would declare a consensus on the disputed abortion language. "That is not so certain," said a senior Vatican negotiator.
If a consensus is declared, that would leave the Vatican and its few allies to register their reservations at the formal conclusion of the conference on Tuesday.
Mr. Biegman reported an agreement on all of Chapter 7, a section on reproductive rights and reproductive health that the United States views as a cornerstone of a new approach to development and population issues.
United States officials said the compromise involved inserting language to remove any impression that abortion could be construed as a universal right or that it could be perceived as a means of family planning.
The officials also reported that a smaller drafting committee had offered changes in a paragraph alluding to the sexual rights of "marriages and other unions," to meet the objections raised primarily by Egypt and other Islamic countries that the language endorsed homosexuality and promiscuity.
European diplomats said there had been no final agreement on that issue.
 
Formal Objections Expected
 Even though language on abortion has apparently been drafted to the approval of many delegations, it is widely expected that the Vatican and other delegations will register formal objections to any suggestion that abortion should be legal.
Under United Nations rules, delegations can do so in committees or at the conference's final session. To insure that their position makes the most impact and secures the widest publicity, delegates say it is politically astute to raise objections at the last minute in the full session, when the reservations are formally inserted into the document published as the conference's conclusions.


GRAPHIC: Burgeoning growth in East Asia's emerging economies has been one of the most pressing issues facing the United Nations population conference in Cairo. Considerable attention has also been devoted to China and India, already population juggernauts, which have high growth in terms of absolute numbers of people. Western Europe and North America, on the other hand, have relatively low rates of population growth.

HEADLINE: As Primary Nears, Barry Runs Hard

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
In the final weekend before a Democratic primary virtually certain to produce the District of Columbia's next mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr., the man driven from that office by a drug conviction, is close to achieving what many residents once thought unimaginable.
With the city reeling from a serious budget deficit, an eroding quality of life and strained relations with Congress, he finds himself a leading contender to be returned to office, despite having ended his last term four years ago with a six-month jail sentence. 
 Mr. Barry, who was Mayor for 12 years, is practically tied for the lead in recent polls with John Ray, a city councilman for 15 years who has run for mayor unsuccessfully three times. Each is favored by nearly one-third of the voters. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, who succeeded Mr. Barry in 1990, promising change and reform, is a distant third with less than 20 percent of voters' support.
In the last days of the campaign, Mr. Barry and Mr. Ray have focused much of their efforts on undecided voters and those who might be swayed by a late-inning argument.
 
Last-Minute Campaigning
 Today, in ideal weather conditions for handshakes and kibbitzing, the 58-year-old Mr. Barry meandered about the city on a schedule that included nine campaign stops in five of Washington's eight wards. Mr. Ray planned to appear in 10 places in six wards. Mrs. Kelly's official schedule included only one stop.
Mr. Ray, a 51-year-old lawyer, has been endorsed by several big unions, leading business organizations and The Washington Post. But the most electrifying theme throughout the campaign has been Mr. Barry's robust return to citywide politics, attempting to convince voters that he can be trusted enough to serve as mayor again.
To many, it has been an easy sell. The willingness to forgive and acknowledge repentance runs strong and deep, especially in poorer sections of the city, where crime, drug use and shabby public housing are fixed parts of the urban landscape. These residents have seen countless people fall prey to guns and drugs, and they rarely have the chance to share in the kind of triumph over misfortune that Mr. Barry says he has experienced.
 
'Some Charisma'
 "I'm just blessed with some charisma," he said in an interview, explaining why voters would still find him attractive as a candidate. "I have substance. But I add style to it. That means you're really dynamite."
But to voters less convinced of Mr. Barry's sincerity or worthiness to serve, particularly whites and many affluent blacks, his campaign represents little more than a power grab, an audacious one at that, with campaign themes that implore voters to look forward, not back.
That is asking a lot, critics say, given the city's deterioration during Mr. Barry's last four-year term and the graphic nature of his fall. The former Mayor was caught smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel room, with the entire scene captured by the authorities on videotape.
With so little time before the primary, Mr. Barry's biggest problem could be expanding his support base beyond its solid core. Over the summer, he has held fairly steady in the polls, with Mr. Ray surging lately and Mrs. Kelly flagging.
But Mr. Barry has managed to energize other constituencies, including voters in the contiguous Wards 4, 5 and 7 along the northeast boundary of the city, with their heavy black middle-class population.
"I think the vote here is going to be split," said James Chappelle, a real estate developer and one of 10 candidates in Ward 5 running for the City Council. "Ray has a lot of support here. Barry has a whole lot of support. The sentiment right now is that Barry was considered a good mayor. His personal problems, that's his business. Hey, Oliver North is running for the Senate in Virginia. Come on."
 
Endorsement by the Post
 The Post's endorsement, which came on Friday, had been anxiously awaited by all the candidates, but especially by Mr. Ray and Mrs. Kelly, the only two who had a reasonable expectation of getting it.
Mr. Barry had no hope that The Post would endorse him. Yet this week he turned its endorsement of Mr. Ray into his own campaign tool, proclaiming that it was little more than a "stop Marion Barry movement" to help any other candidate to prevail.
Mr. Ray, who supported Mr. Barry in 1978, scoffed at such a notion. "The Post endorsed him in 1978, 1982 and 1986," he said. "You didn't hear him complaining then. You get the message."
Mr. Ray is also telling voters that Mr. Barry and Mrs. Kelly have become a "tag team," with some sort of tacit agreement to attack only Mr. Ray, not each other.
At the same time, Mrs. Kelly is portraying Mr. Ray and Mr. Barry as two of a kind politically. In one of her latest radio commercials, music from the television series The Odd Couple plays in the background as a voice blames Mr. Barry and Mr. Ray for the mess she inherited.
"I'm still the only candidate of change," Mrs. Kelly told reporters on Friday.
For the most part, the events of Mr. Barry's downfall -- his arrest, conviction and incarceration -- have played a commanding role in the campaign only in the broadest context. For example, Mr. Ray and Mrs. Kelly occasionally refer to that night in the hotel room. "This election is not about the Vista Hotel and Mr. Barry's redemption," Mr. Ray said this week.
 
Barry's Record at Issue
 But in general, they emphasize the state of government when Mr. Barry departed, and challenge him on the more pertinent, and possibly more damaging, issue of his record as Mayor.
In response, Mr. Barry has built his campaign around themes of rehabilitation and redemption. While he has not ducked specific questions about the past, he does his best to deflect them. He has apologized for the "pain" he caused the city but argues that "1990 was a snapshot, not the whole picture, and I bring to the table a lot more than videotape."
"Most people are recovering from something," he said, when asked about winning the voter's trust. "Like a storm. You're either in a storm or have just come out of a storm or on the way to a storm."
He cited examples of people who go bankrupt, people who drink too much, people who use drugs. He said: "So here's this man who can come back to be better than he was before he went down, and so they say, 'God, maybe I'll decide to stop feeling sorry for myself right here. Maybe I'll grab onto something he grabbed onto.' That's the lesson."
And the parable for his campaign: He fell; he rose.
"The city's on its knees now," he said. "It was probably down when I was there, but it was never knocked to its knees like this. I know the government better than anybody else. I know it up and down. I have more ideas about how you solve problems than anybody else, so add that to the dimension of my personal recovery, and somebody might say, 'Well, maybe he can bring this city back to greatness and glory.' "

HEADLINE: Rosenbaum and Pataki Close on Issues

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 9

 BODY:
At first blush the Republican primary for governor on Tuesday seems a contest between two candidates whose visions are canyons apart.
One hopeful, Richard M. Rosenbaum, has deep roots in the liberal Rockefeller wing of the party and says he is crusading to "return the party to the moderates." 
 The other contender, State Senator George E. Pataki, has courted the ascendant right wing of the Republicans and has won the Conservative Party endorsement.
But beneath the ideological trappings the differences blur. Mr. Rosenbaum, aware that Republican primary voters tend to lean right, calls himself "conservative enough" in a commercial. Mr. Pataki, firmly focused on winning Democratic votes in November, has billed himself as a "social moderate."
A result is that in a virtual nonrace that Mr. Pataki has all but ignored, the two have staked out similar just-right-of-center positions on a variety of issues like cutting taxes, spending, the death penalty, tougher penalties for violent felons and restricting welfare programs.
"The born-again Pataki is being refashioned as a centrist, and that's where Rosenbaum has been," a poll taker from New Hartford, John Zogby, said. "They are certainly not playing up many differences."
On just one issue, abortion, do they clearly disagree. Both make appeals to female voters by labeling themselves as "pro-choice" on abortion. But while Mr. Rosenbaum opposes any restrictions on abortion, Mr. Pataki, keeping a foot in the conservative camp, backs mandatory waiting periods, parental notification for minors and counseling for women seeking abortions financed by Medicaid.
But there are few such sharp differences. Although Mr. Pataki has offered few specifics about his platform -- he differs from Mr. Rosenbaum in that he has released no position papers and rejected requests for an interview for this article -- his speeches, previous interviews and legislative record clearly suggest that he supports many of the same ideas as Mr. Rosenbaum.
Nowhere is that clearer than on taxes. Both politicians accuse Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of promoting high-tax policies that, they say, have driven jobs out of state. Both offer tax-reduction plans that are more extensive than Mr. Cuomo's.
Mr. Rosenbaum has called for reducing taxes $4 billion a year from the $34 billion collected in taxes and fees, largely by cutting the top personal income-tax rate of 7.785 percent to 6.7 percent. He would eliminate state income taxes on capital gains; raise the taxable income at which the top rate takes effect, from $26,000 a year for married couples to $100,000, and increase the number of poor people who pay no taxes.
Mr. Pataki has said he will also cut the personal income tax, though he has not specified by how much. And he has called for cutting a variety of business taxes, including immediately ending the surcharge on corporate income taxes and reducing the minimum and petroleum taxes.
Both candidates advance a trickle-down theory that tax cuts will pay for themselves by stimulating the economy and creating jobs. But they also say the state needs to slash spending.
Mr. Rosenbaum has released a plan for cutting $1 billion in his first year as governor that will include reducing welfare payments, eliminating some services for prisoners, raising tuition for wealthier students at state colleges and reducing wages at state construction projects.
Mr. Pataki pinpoints three areas to trim waste. He says by leaving empty one-third of the vacancies in its work force each year, the state could save $300 million annually. Second, he has called for consolidating the State Energy Office with another agency, an idea that Mr. Cuomo suggested in 1991 but that the Legislature rejected. And he has called for cutting back the Education Department, which had a $278 million budget last year.
Several of Mr. Rosenbaum's budget proposals would require legislative approval and would most likely face fights. Most of Mr. Pataki's proposals could probably be carried out by the governor alone, but it is not clear that they would createprojected savings.
Statistics from the Governor's Budget Office indicate that Mr. Pataki's plan to reduce employees would save half of what he estimates, or $150 million a year. Abolishing the Energy Office would eliminate 214 jobs, according to the budget office.
The state supplies $56 million of the Education Department budget. The rest is mostly Federal money. Under Mr. Cuomo the department has reduced its state-financed positions 62 percent, from 2,551 to 969.
Neither Republican candidate has offered plans for reigning in the two largest components of the $34.2 billion annual state budget, Medicaid, which has grown at double-digit rates in recent years, and school aid, which has more than doubled, to $9.6 billion, since 1983.
 
Recipients to Managed Care
 Both Republicans say they would try to cut Medicaid costs by sending additional recipients to managed-care programs, a procedure that the Cuomo administration is carrying out. The Republican candidates say education aid can be controlled by reducing administrative costs, although neither has pinpointed how.
Both candidates have suggested that they might want to increase school aid, because that can help control local property taxes. And both say they support a state takeover of Medicaid costs that counties now pay. That would add more than $3 billion a year to the state budget.
"Somebody might say, 'Isn't that more big government,' " Mr. Rosenbaum said about the Medicaid takeover. "But no way. It's a good argument for bringing down the costs."
On what is possibly the most important issue this year, crime, the two candidates have offered the death penalty as the centerpiece of their platforms. "There is no question in my mind that the death penalty will save lives," Mr. Pataki often says.
Both men have also called for restricting, even ending, parole for violent criminals. Both support life sentences without parole for criminals convicted of their third felonies. And both Republicans have endorsed banning military-style assault weapons, although Mr. Rosenbaum has accused Mr. Pataki of waffling on the issue because he voted against a proposal by Democrats in the State Senate that would have sharply restricted ownership of such weapons.
The two candidates have both called for drastically curtailing welfare costs. Mr. Rosenbaum said he would limit welfare payments for childless able-bodied adults in the home-relief program to one year. There is no time limit now. Mr. Pataki has said he would consider ending payments after 90 days. Both politicians said they would also require welfare recipients to work or attend school in exchange for payments.
Mr. Rosenbaum has also proposed requiring teen-age welfare mothers to live with their parents, cutting welfare grants for families to the national average, by about 40 percent, and not giving welfare mothers additional money for new children.
On the environment the candidates say they want to protect open space in the Adirondacks and elsewhere, but neither has endorsed significant state land purchases to achieve that. Both also say they oppose building garbage incinerators.
"Incineration has proven to be environmentally and economically costly," Mr. Pataki has said.
In a race with so few clear policy differences, Mr. Rosenbaum has sought to distinguish himself by running as an outsider, even though he is a former state party chairman. He has proposed a host of changes with populist appeal, including recall, initiative and referendum, term limits and easier ballot access.
 
ISSUES
Governor's Race: Where the Republicans Stand

Spending
 
Mr. Rosenbaum: Has proposed raising the tuition at state-run colleges for upper income families and reducing wages paid on state construction projects.
 
Mr. Pataki: Has said he would let one-third of all vacancies in the state work force go unfilled each year, would turn prison health services over to private companies and would reduce the state education administration.

HEADLINE: At Immigration, Disarray and Defeat

SERIES: Chaos at the Gates -- First of five articles.

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not bother to collect as much as $23 million a year in fees, easy money that could be gathered with just a letter here or a phone call there. That is because, officials say, the agency cannot afford to hire the accounting clerks to write those letters and make those calls.
Yet each month the immigration service finds a way to allow dozens of its inspectors to take round-trip, all-expenses-paid cruises to places like Nassau in the Bahamas and Cozumel, Mexico, often accompanied by friends or family members whose expenses are also paid by the cruise lines. The inspectors' job is to check the passengers' travel documents on the return trip. 
 It is a curious division of resources -- no staff to collect millions but just enough to perform a courtesy service for the cruise industry. Yet it is a classic example of the mismanagement that plagues the immigration service, perhaps the most troubled major agency in the Federal Government.
An investigation by The New York Times has found that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an arm of the Justice Department, is broadly dysfunctional. Hobbled by understaffing, underfinancing, conflicting mandates from Congress and widespread mismanagement failures, it is an agency in disarray. It lurches from one immigration emergency to the next, its employees demoralized, its mission unrealized.
On the most mundane level, the agency cannot even find a way to open its mail and answer its phones. On a more serious one, it does not make a concerted effort to find and deport most aliens with criminal records.
Even its own officials, inured to failure, consider the agency ill-equipped to handle its ever-rising demands.
"Lots of people are burned out, fed up, not willing to go on," said Walter D. Cadman, district director in Miami.
Among the findings by The Times, emerging from interviews with scores of I.N.S. employees nationwide, were these:
*No agency of the Government is more vulnerable to corruption than the I.N.S., where front-line workers, paid little more than the minimum wage, give out green cards and other coveted documents that are worth thousands of dollars on the black market. Year after year, dozens of employees are arrested for taking bribes or related crimes. Yet even when corruption cases repeatedly expose glaring weaknesses in the system, the agency usually neglects to correct them.
*Deportation officers seldom deport anyone. Most deportations that do occur are carried out on an honor system. Deportees are asked to turn themselves in on a certain day. In New York, for example, only about 4 percent actually show up.
*More than four million aliens come to the immigration service each year with simple and perfectly legal requests for green cards, work authorizations or other permits, but, as one senior manager put it, "we make people suffer." At I.N.S. offices throughout the country, telephones go unanswered, mail goes unopened, and immigrants stand in daylong lines that often lead them to surly, untrained workers who cannot answer their questions. Even Attorney General Janet Reno complains that sometimes when she calls the immigration service she cannot get through.
For its inquiry The Times interviewed more than 100 agency employees and visited immigration service offices in Chicago, El Paso, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Phoenix and San Francisco, among other cities. The employees ranged from entry-level workers to senior officers at headquarters in Washington. Most were selected by their supervisors, presumably because the supervisors thought these employees would present the agency's best face. What the employees offered, however -- with a candor that is rare in government -- was a grim one.
"We have no mission, no tools, no leadership, so where are we?" complained Juan Bustos, a deportation officer in San Francisco.
Patrick E. Kane, acting director of the Phoenix office, said, "We're dabbling in everything, and we aren't really doing anything."
Robert E. Crebbs, a special agent in San Francisco, lamented, "There's overwhelming apathy from top to bottom."
And A. D. Moyer, district director in Chicago, said: "A lot of people have gone out of their way to make this a cold, rude, insensitive and inefficient agency. The mentality of this organization leaves a lot to be desired."
Ruth Anne Myers worked for the immigration service for 33 years, and in June, just four days after she retired as director of the Phoenix office, she reflected on the agency's latest budget crisis.
"It's a mess," she said, shaking her head, "and I don't know if we've ever been in a bigger mess."
All of this fosters a numbing fatalism. As a senior examinations officer in Miami put it, "No matter what we do, good or bad, it makes no difference."
 
The Task
Impossible Job, Few Advocates
 The service's mission, broadly stated, is to keep illegal aliens out of the country and admit legal immigrants in an efficient, orderly manner. To accomplish those goals it has about 19,000 employees and will spend $1.6 billion this year. About one-third of that is from fees the agency collects from immigrants.
Its budget has nearly tripled and its work force has grown by 50 percent since 1986, but in that time the agency's workload has markedly increased, too.
Last year the agency admitted almost one million new residents and naturalized several hundred thousand others. It also handled more than three million requests for work permits, border passes or other documents.
In addition, the agency apprehends more than one million aliens each year as they try to enter the country illegally. Theoretically, the I.N.S. is also responsible for finding and deporting almost four million others who are here. And it must be ready to scramble whenever unexpected immigration emergencies flare, like those in Haiti and Cuba.
With all that and more, agency officials say, the I.N.S. is overwhelmed. In fact, the service's performance has usually been so lacking that others in Government have generally preferred to look the other way and dispose of the problem with a simple explanation: the task is impossible; there is no way the United States can control its vast, open borders.
As a result, the I.N.S. has remained, in the words of a former Commissioner, Gene McNary, "the agency nobody cared about -- dumped on, dirty-faced kids."
The occasional official who does take an interest finds that a large part of the problem is the I.N.S. itself. "I tell you, 90 days over there, and you don't know whether to laugh or to cry," said Don Wortman, a former senior official at several Federal agencies who served on a Federal panel that studied the I.N.S. three years ago.
Most members of Congress see no political benefit in trying to improve the agency. After all, "in the immigration business, you're never right," said Chris Sale, the Deputy Commissioner. "Half the people always think you're wrong, depending on which half of the people you're dealing with."
 
An Unpopular Cause
 As a consequence, the immigration oversight committees remain among the least popular in Congress. The Senate subcommittee has only three members, the minimum number, because "we could only find three senators who were willing to be on it," said Jerry Tinker, its longtime staff director. Only two other Senate subcommittees are as unpopular -- the one that oversees the Federal deficit and the one that looks after the Internal Revenue Service. The House immigration subcommittee is among the smallest in that chamber, too.
But now, for the first time, the rest of Government may have to take an interest. Politicians from the border states are in open rebellion over Federal immigration policy, denouncing it as a failure. Several of those states are suing the Federal Government, saying millions of illegal aliens are draining their resources. And from Florida to California this year, immigration has become a fiery issue in election campaigns.
"Our immigration crisis demands action, and it demands it this year!" Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, declared in June.
Representative Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of California, said as the lawsuits were being filed this spring, "All of a sudden, immigration sort of arrived, or ripened and blossomed as a national issue."
Doris M. Meissner, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, is well aware that she runs a deeply troubled agency. "In the current climate," she said, "I don't think we can continue to get by with some of these chronic and traditional behaviors."
Ms. Meissner was a senior manager at the immigration service in the early 1980's and after that worked as an immigration expert at a research institute in Washington. When she took office last October, the Clinton Administration and Congress made it clear that they expected her to rescue the agency. Very quickly she outlined an aggressive strategy for change, and she is now reorganizing the management structure. It was "dysfunctional" when she took office, Ms. Meissner said.
Even with that change and many others planned, Ms. Meissner has come to a disquieting realization. The agency's problems remain so numerous, so deep and so daunting that many of her own employees openly question whether she or anyone else can turn things around.
"These are huge challenges," she said in an interview. "I know the jury's still out."
Attorney General Reno echoed that. "It is very difficult to create a functional agency," she said, "while at the same time addressing all the emergencies that constantly beset it," like the Cuban refugee crisis. "I don't think Doris and I are satisfied yet, but I am proud of what they have done."
 
The Leadership
Little Guidance, Less Control
 The Commissioner of immigration presides over an empire -- more than 19,000 employees in 62 offices throughout the country and 3 overseas. To manage such a collection is difficult at best. But the service's own district leaders say they are not being managed at all. Most say they never speak to their supervisors in Washington, and this communication failure contributes to almost every one of the agency's other problems.
"You feel like the Lone Ranger out here, you're so out of touch," said Mr. Kane, the acting director in Phoenix.
Mr. Cadman, head of the Miami office, said: "We get no guidance. We have a feeling we're adrift, in limbo."
And Mr. Moyer, head of the Chicago office, said, "I didn't speak to my boss for two and one-half years."
James A. Puleo, an executive associate commissioner in Washington, was responsible for supervising all of the districts from January 1993 until last July. "I agree with them that the system doesn't work very well," he said of his district leaders. "But I only have an illustrious staff of two. I don't call them up to chat about nothing."
Ms. Meissner, the Commissioner, said the new management structure would alleviate the problem, and Mr. Moyer said he had already seen some improvement from his Chicago vantage point. But that will not necessarily clear up another complaint, this one by Richard K. Rogers, head of the Los Angeles office: that "absolutely no one is held accountable" for his work.
 
Expense-Paid Cruises
 The leadership vacuum can breed embarrassments, like the messy problem of en route inspections.
The I.N.S. is responsible for checking passengers arriving on cruise ships, usually as they step off the ship. But some cruise lines prefer to have the inspector carry out the work during the cruise, as a convenience to passengers. So dozens of times each week, immigration inspectors from ports around the country sail to Mexico, the Caribbean or more distant points, with little work to do on the outbound trip, and then carry out the inspections on the way back.
The Justice Department's Inspector General's Office looked into the practice and found that on some of the inspectors' trips, "family members and friends accompanied them for free or on discounted fares." The inspectors traveled free, too. In addition, the report said, if an inspector had other costs, "such as taxi fares, hotels, meals, etc., the ship's purser would reimburse the inspector directly." Most were one-day cruises, but some lasted five days. While on board, some inspectors charged the cruise lines for overtime.
All of this, the Inspector General's Office concluded in its report last spring, "creates a conflict of interest." And "since an inspector can fine a cruise line $3,000 for each undocumented alien discovered," the Inspector General wondered whether all these gratuities "could result in more lenient inspections." But perhaps the most startling finding in the report was that while I.N.S. management officials knew in a general sense that some inspectors were doing inspections en route, they were unaware of the fringe benefits.
"This wasn't something I knew about," said Mr. Cadman, head of the Miami office. "But it's wrong, flat wrong."
The agency's leaders were informed of the Inspector General's preliminary findings on May 21, 1993. But nothing was done about them for more than a year. A few weeks ago Mr. Cadman said he had given his staff no new instructions about accepting gratuities, and during a round-table discussion with eight Miami office employees, all of them said they had not heard about the report.
"There has been no notice of it," one said. She had carried out an en route inspection the day before.
Mr. Cadman said, "I'm waiting for headquarters to set a policy."
At headquarters, Mr. Puleo deplored the practice of taking family members along and declared: "The directive on that went out a year ago. We stopped it." But asked for documentary evidence, Mr. Puleo said through a spokesman that he had misspoken. Actually, nothing had been done.
Guidelines forbidding the acceptance of gratuities were finally issued only after a reporter asked about them this summer.
The Money
Millions Owing, No One to Collect
 Year after year, budget crises ripple through the I.N.S. The agency repeatedly overestimates the fees it will collect from immigrants and visitors, fails to plan for the inevitable immigration emergencies, then loses track of much of the money it does have. Finally the agency finds itself with another shortfall, and that hobbles every effort to start new programs or fix old problems.
"Budgeting over there," said Mr. Tinker of the Senate immigration subcommittee, "is an Alice in Wonderland kind of thing."
After Congress passed major immigration laws in 1986 and 1990, the agency grew so quickly that "the infrastructure collapsed," said Ms. Sale, the Deputy Commissioner.
But financial management at the agency has long been sloppy. In 1980, the Senate Judiciary Committee demanded a management study before it would appropriate any money. In 1990, the General Accounting Office said the agency's budget process was "deplorable." Today, the Office of Management and Budget labels the financial controls at the I.N.S. "high risk," meaning they "warrant top-level attention at the agency and by the Congress."
Kenneth W. Rath has been a senior I.N.S. financial officer since 1991, and he now heads that office. Critical audit after critical audit has landed on his desk. "I was the guy who was hired to sit on that stack of audit reports," he said, "and I've solved those problems."
But around the country, other I.N.S. officials laughed at that. They noted that about the time Mr. Rath made that remark this summer, his office announced that the agency was once again $60 million short.
That led to the annual rite of midyear budget cuts in every office. "We just had to cancel our contract with the convention center, where we were holding naturalization ceremonies," said Mr. Cadman, the Miami director. "We couldn't pay the rent."
 
Mail Doesn't Go Through
 Part of the problem is downstairs in Mr. Cadman's own mail room. Because of budget shortages, the office does not have enough people to open the mail -- 1,500 letters a day. Many of the envelopes contain checks and cash -- application fees that could be fed into the I.N.S. budget. "Right now," the records and information supervisor for the office said, "we're opening mail from a month ago."
Even when the office does get around to opening the letters, Mr. Cadman said, the volume of mail is so great that if a letter does not have the immigrant's file number on it, "we can't deal with it."
"It goes in a box," he said. "We have a million letters like that in boxes. We don't know what to do with them."
The paradox is that the agency may hold the solution to many of these problems in its own hands. It lies in another critical audit from the Justice Department, one that landed on Mr. Rath's desk a few months ago.
Airlines and cruise ships collect $6 from each passenger arriving in the United States, and they are supposed to turn that money over to the I.N.S. But the Justice Department found that the agency was failing to collect the fees from 22 airlines and six cruise lines -- a loss of as much as $23 million a year.
Mr. Rath explained: "I can't say that's wrong because I don't know. But there are only two people down there monitoring this" in accounting.
The agency has the authority to subpoena records from the carriers and call witnesses. But to collect the money, usually just a bit of research along with a letter or phone call is enough.
 
A Simple Solution?
 Mr. Rath conceded that the sensible solution might simply be to put more clerks in that office, considering the money they could easily collect. But he said that was easier said than done. "When you ask Congress for funding for support personnel, it's not very glamorous," he said, adding with a wave of the hand, "it's the first thing they cut."
On Capitol Hill, Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, a Kentucky Democrat who heads the House immigration subcommittee, was visibly stunned by that notion. He almost bellowed as he said: "We'd leap across the committee table to give them those people and 10 more! We're not stupid. But they've never asked."
The carrier fees are only one example of the millions of dollars the agency is owed that it fails to collect. The I.N.S. also loses track of the bonds that many immigrants post to guarantee that they will appear for hearings. When an immigrant does not show up, the bond money is forfeited to the immigration service. But in many offices no one looks at the bonds again -- and finally they expire.
"We don't have anybody assigned to that," Phil Waters, acting director of the San Francisco office, acknowledged with a shrug. "The only time we go back and look at some of the bonds is if somebody asks."
Nationwide, the Justice Department found, the immigration service failed to collect about $38 million in bond money in the last six years.
All of that, Mr. Rath said matter-of-factly, "is an inevitable result of the management situation we have." But in Phoenix, Ms. Myers thinks explanations like that are too facile.
"This kind of thing goes on year after year, but nobody's ever held accountable," she said, her voice rising with anger. "Nobody loses his job. Nobody gets demoted. Everyone gets their bonuses. Now here we are again in 1994 and we're $60 million short. It's so depressing."

HEADLINE: Leaders in Their Fields, From Science to Business, Who Died in USAir Crash;
Edwin K. Wiles, Energy Consultant, 50

 BODY:
Edwin K. Wiles, an energy consultant who once headed the West Virginia Coal Association, died on Thursday in the USAir plane crash. He was 50 and lived in Mount Lebanon, Pa.
As a reporter for United Press International in the late 1960's, Mr. Wiles covered the rescue of coal miners trapped underground in Hominy Falls, W.Va., prompting a lifelong interest in the coal industry. 
 That interest lead to jobs as vice president of corporate relations for the West Virginia Coal Association, a group representing coal mine owners, from 1970 to 1974 and president of the association from 1974 to 1985. Later, he worked as an energy consultant specializing in coal interests. Most recently, he was a vice president of the Center for Energy and Economic Development, a Virginia-based organization that promotes coal use.
He was born in Tunnelton, W.Va., and graduated from West Virginia University.
He is survived by his wife, Sheri; two sons, Edwin Jr. and Kevin; his mother, Mrs. Harrison Fuller of Keyser, W.Va., and a sister, Carolyn Sue Wiles of Kansas City, Mo.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 10

 BODY:
A group of Latin American and Caribbean presidents urged the United States today to lift its economic embargo of Cuba and called for a peaceful transition to democracy there.
The leaders of the Rio Group of presidents also issued a statement urging the military government of Haiti to step down in order to avoid an American-led invasion. 
 The presidents said in a statement at the end of the 14-country Rio Group Summit that they were anxious to increase their contacts with Cuba and to incorporate it fully into the hemispheric community.
The Rio Group countries "consider indispensable a peaceful transition towards a democratic and pluralist system in Cuba that will respect human rights and freedom of opinion, that is consonant with the popular will," the statement said.

HEADLINE: China Warns U.S. on Relations With Taiwan

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 10

 BODY:
China registered another "strong protest" today over the Clinton Administration's decision to upgrade unofficial ties with Taiwan, warning that Taiwan was a potentially "explosive issue."
A senior Foreign Ministry official summoned Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy and accused Washington of "taking steps" to create "two Chinas, or one China, one Taiwan," and said this would not only stall the development of relations but would also lead to their deterioration. 
 "We demand that the U.S. Government approach the question of Taiwan with every seriousness and caution," the official, Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, said in remarks carried on the official New China News Agency.
Mr. Liu accused Washington of "gross interference in China's internal affairs" and of infringing upon China's sovereignty, saying, "This represents a major retrogression of the United States policy on the question of Taiwan, which will entail grave consequences."
Western diplomats here have nevertheless argued that China's warning does not portend a serious rift in relations. Indeed, for the last several weeks, the Chinese leadership has been questioning American officials to determine what it will take for President Clinton to make a state visit to Beijing as a sign that relations are improving.
Beijing's Taiwan strategy appears to be one of stepping up diplomatic pressure to counter the recent successes of Taipei in winning greater recognition for its economic power.
China immediately protested on Wednesday when the Administration announced a series of modest upgrades in the unofficial relationship that has existed between Washington and Taipei since formal diplomatic ties were severed in 1979 with the recognition of the People's Republic of China. Mr. Clinton, who traveled to Taiwan five times before he became President, has reaffirmed the "one China" policy that American Presidents have adhered to since 1949.
At the core of the dispute over Taiwan are American military sales, most prominently the sale of F-16's that President Bush approved in the middle of his re-election campaign.
This year Beijing told Washington that it would not discuss the issue of missile technology assistance for Pakistan until Washington agreed to high-level discussions on military sales to Taiwan. The State Department's third ranking diplomat, Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, is expected to arrive in Beijing next week for talks.

HEADLINE: Primary Tests Strength of Troubled Party

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Two months after winning the Democratic Party's endorsement for his bid to become Connecticut's next governor, John B. Larson is waiting to see what that support is worth.
Mr. Larson, the president pro tem of the State Senate, is facing a tough primary election on Tuesday against an insurgent candidate, State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr. The two men have approached the contest with different strategies, and the election has turned into something of a bellwether of the future of the state's Democratic Party. 
 Mr. Curry, whose base is the liberal wing of the party, has spent months building an independent field operation, identifying voters who support him, repeatedly calling them through phone banks and preparing to get them to polls. A longtime critic of the party, he has used his campaign to call for its overhaul.
In contrast, Mr. Larson has concentrated on raising money and saturating the airwaves with television commercials describing his effectiveness as the leader of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature. An elected official who proudly wraps himself in the party's tradition, he is counting on Democratic town committees and the campaign organizations of elected officials to get out the vote for him on Tuesday.
"If Curry wins, the lesson will be that the organized Democratic Party has no life in it any more -- that it can't produce any votes," David McQuade, a top adviser to Mr. Larson, said recently.
 
Four Years After Setback
 The campaign comes four years after the Democrats suffered one of their worst setbacks in state history. After holding the governor's office for 16 years and dominating state politics for decades, the party ran a candidate in 1990 -- Bruce Morrison, a former United States Representative -- who received a little more than 20 percent of the vote.
The dismal showing was largely attributable to the presence of Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an almost legendary figure in Connecticut politics, who won the election as the candidate of a new third party, A Connecticut Party. Democrats have acknowledged that the defeat was aggravated by dissension in the party and the failure of the party organization to mobilize effectively behind Mr. Morrison.
 
A Different Race
 This year's race is very different from 1990's. Mr. Weicker is not seeking re-election, and A Connecticut Party's candidate is Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, who lacks Mr. Weicker's political stature and has not yet demonstrated an ability to raise money. The Republican candidate will be the winner of Tuesday's primary between Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer and John Rowland, a former Representative who was the candidate in 1990 and is considered the front-runner in both the primary and general election.
While Mr. Curry and Mr. Larson have said they would avoid the pitfalls Mr. Morrison encountered, the two have different ideas of what those pitfalls were, and their campaigns reflect those perceptions.
Mr. Larson said in an interview a few weeks ago that Mr. Morrison ran into trouble because he was viewed as a "programmatic liberal" challenging the three-term Democratic Governor, William A. O'Neill, who ultimately decided not to run. In Mr. Larson's view, this cost Mr. Morrison the support of some party stalwarts and of conservative Democrats, who felt comfortable voting for Mr. Weicker, a former Republican Senator known for moderate views.
Mr. Morrison's problems were worsened by his difficulty in raising money and getting his message out, Mr. Larson added.
Since declaring his candidacy in April 1993, Mr. Larson has put much of his energy into raising $1.4 million and has spent more than $500,000 on commercials to portray him as a likable moderate Democrat. The ads highlight his support for anti-crime measures like a more broadly applied death penalty, his opposition to the income tax and his success in achieving social service legislation, like the Family Medical Leave Act and a bill expanding immunization for children.
 
Seeking Name Recognition
 Polls found that this approach increased Mr. Larson's favorable name recognition, which could be helpful in November's general election against the expected Republican opponent, Mr. Rowland, already is well known from 1990. The ads are also credited with giving Mr. Larson a 2-to-1 edge over Mr. Curry in polls of registered Democrats.
But the problem for Mr. Larson is that the commercials have less impact on the primary, in which only a small percentage -- as little as 20 percent -- is expected to vote. As a result, the primary may be decided by the candidates' ability to get supporters to the polls.
Mr. Larson is depending on the party organization and the campaign operations of other Democratic elected officials, particularly the mayors of the largest cities, to bring out the vote on his behalf on Tuesday.
Anthony V. Avallone, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a former State Senator who supports Mr. Larson, said: "The trend in campaigns in recent years has been to be candidate oriented, to run things out of the headquarters of candidates. There's been a diminution of reliance on the party. John is trying to change that. He got the party endorsement and feels it's important. He's going to rely on his organization to supplement the existing party organization."
But Mr. Curry's supporters say that the existing party machine no longer can pull votes, and they say that other elected officials such as the mayors are not going to be able to convert the personal allegiance of their own constituencies into votes for Mr. Larson.
"They have no grass-roots campaign," Mr. Curry recently told a group of supporters to resounding applause.
Instead, it is necessary to build a new organization to replace the old party apparatus, Mr. Curry said, and for months his campaign has concentrated on assembling a coalition of unions, citizens' groups and environmental groups to identify his supporters and line them up to vote.
The strategy reflects Mr. Curry's belief that the previous Democratic candidate, Mr. Morrison, faltered not because of his criticisms of the policies of his party's control of the state government, but because he did not distance himself enough from an administration that ran up a $1 billion deficit.
 
'A Whole Bunch of Negatives'
 "Morrison transferred a whole bunch of negatives onto himself," Mr. Curry said. "It's unfortunate, because he was not really of that crowd, but he got all the negatives of Bill O'Neill and never had a chance to shake them off."
Throughout the campaign, Mr. Curry, who as Comptroller and as a State Senator from 1979 to 1983 often clashed with party leaders, has cast himself as an outsider who would shake up the established order.
Mr. Curry has raised $845,000 and put most of the money into developing his field operation.
Despite these different approaches, the two candidates agree on many issues, from hiring more police officers to expanding day-care services to revamping the state's economic development department to place greater emphasis on providing assistance to small businesses.
The two disagree in their approaches to cutting taxes, with Mr. Larson giving priority to reducing the income tax and Mr. Curry favoring a lightening of the property tax burden. They also part ways over state approval for a casino in Bridgeport, with Mr. Larson in favor and Mr. Curry opposed.
But in five debates, the two have discussed these and other issues amicably, and the race has been devoid of the personal attacks that many had expected. Even the state Republican chairman, John Mastropietro, commended them on running such a "gentlemanly" campaign, though adding that their congeniality made the race somewhat boring.
It appears that both candidates recognize that whoever wins on Tuesday will need the other's support. While they may have clashing views on the party's future, they remain loyal Democrats committed to a party victory in November, and have already discussed how to proceed on Wednesday.
Martha Carlson, Mr. Larson's campaign manager, said, "Regardless of who wins Tuesday, we will be united in either headquarters the next day."

More Talks, Same Result: No Progress

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The flame of optimism that flickered among some union people 24 hours earlier quickly dissipated on the 30th day of the baseball players strike yesterday as the union chief charged that the owners don't want an agreement unless the players bow to their will.
Representatives of the two sides held three bargaining sessions on two different matters but made no progress on the salary cap issue that divides them and threatens to force cancellation of the last three weeks of the season and the World Series. 
 No further talks were scheduled, though at the conclusion of the second meeting on the core economic issue, John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox indicated that perhaps the parties should meet again tomorrow or Tuesday. By then or Wednesday at the latest, however, Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, is expected to announce he is calling off major league baseball for 1994.
Neither Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, nor Richard Ravitch, the clubs' chief labor executive, attended any of the sessions. Ravitch was a spectator at the United States Open tennis tournament while Fehr engaged in first a physical, then a verbal workout.
"They're engaging in a show for public relations sake," Fehr said in a telephone interview after he worked out at a Manhattan hotel exercise room. "They have no interest in making a deal. Bud has no interest in making a deal. He got the idea in his head that players have to do what the owners want. They're going to teach us a lesson. That's what Bud's doing."
Later, at a news briefing, Fehr was asked what he would tell the players executive board when it convenes tomorrow in New York.
"I'll tell them," Fehr said, "they have to take the position that spring training is in jeopardy, and if it goes past the end, the owners are counting on breaking them in the spring or May or June."
Selig was back in Milwaukee. He flew to New York Friday and joined the talks long enough to reject the players' tax plan for revenue sharing. He then flew home Friday evening.
"Bud is teaching children a lesson," Fehr said. "This is plain old-fashioned garden variety union-busting. They want to see if they can starve the players out. There's nothing else there."
 
Refusing to Discuss Plan
 Fehr was clearly disgusted at the refusal of the owners even to discuss the players' tax concept. After imploring union officials for months to make a counterproposal to their salary cap plan, the owners dismissed it out of hand, saying the tax on payrolls and revenues did nothing to contain the growth of player salaries.
Speaking by telephone from his office, Selig said Fehr's comments disappointed him.
"If anybody thinks this is anything preordained and we had a plan, that is just sheer and utter nonsense. Were there firm convictions that the system needed to be changed? Yes. Were we willing to discuss that? Yes. There's no sense in getting into a debate about who's being intransigent."
The outbreak of angry words in place of negotiated progress came as no surprise in a dispute that has created rigid positions on both sides and threatens to do irreparable damage to major league baseball and relations between labor and management.
The owners have said they don't have to have a salary cap but cited the lack of a cap in the players' tax concept as they rejected it. The players, who want to retain the existing free-market system of determining salaries, budged slightly in devising their plan but clearly were not willing to place too great a restriction on the salaries they might earn.
 
Fehr Hints at Betrayal
 Because their plan emerged from conversations with Jerry McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies, union officials, who had to persuade players on the negotiating subcommittee to approve the plan, thought the owners at least would be willing to consider it and negotiate from it.
Some union people also thought they saw signs from some members of management Friday that indicated there was some hope for a settlement. But, in his comments yesterday, Fehr almost sounded betrayed.
"On the few occasions when someone said we have to try to work something out," he said, "it was clearly a joke, their authority was stripped or they never had any."
Curiously, McMorris was not one of the owners who attended the economic session yesterday.
"I wasn't asked," he said before returning to Denver. "I'm sure I probably could have asked myself in, but I made it clear that I'll be available by phone and can be back as quick as I'm needed."
Harrington, Stan Kasten of Atlanta and Wendy Selig-Prieb of Milwaukee met in the morning with three union lawyers and four players. Their discussion centered on revenue-sharing ideas. The tax concept was not discussed in great detail.
That meeting lasted for about two hours. Reduced teams met later in the afternoon for an hour.
In another morning session, Chuck O'Connor, general counsel of the clubs' labor relations committee, and Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, led bargaining on other elements of the expired collective bargaining agreement. They reached agreement on nothing.
At the morning session on revenue sharing, the two sides discussed the amount of money the owners' revenue-sharing plan would send from high-revenue clubs to low-revenue clubs. The owners have said that amount was $70 million and made a big issue out of the fact that the players' tax plan would produce only $50 million for the same purpose.
But, one of the participants on the players' side said, the owners acknowledged that if their salary cap proposal were plugged into their revenue-sharing plan using the clubs' pre-strike financial projections for 1994, the amount to be distributed would be more like $60 million.
Selig said yesterday he was "startled" that the players "would come in with considerably less," citing the $70 million to $50 million difference. Asked if he thought the owners might have been able to get the union to raise its total by raising the rate of tax on club payrolls, he said, "I don't know."
The owners obviously had no desire to find out.

HEADLINE: Retired Executives Aid Nonprofit Sector

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Out of Retirement Life, and Back Into the Fire" (The Executive Life, Aug. 14) makes no mention of the National Executive Service Corps, a sister organization of the International Executive Corps. 
 The N.E.S.C.'s volunteer retired senior executives provide pro bono management consulting services to not-for-profits in the arts, health care, education and social services -- unlike the for-profit clients of the retired executives being recruited by search firms and the Agency for International Development.
The Agency for International Development, an arm of the State Department and financed by taxpayers, directs its efforts toward political ends only, and at times seems to be working against the very taxpayers who support it.
I have had experience as an independent consultant working in Central America and witnessed the efforts of the Agency for International Development to entice United States companies to shift work from United States plants to Central American companies (for-profit organizations), to the detriment of the American workers whose jobs were eliminated. This effort was purely political to create jobs as a bulwark against communism. Should public money be used to support private enterprise here or abroad?
The N.E.S.C. offers critically needed management experience to the not-for-profit sector and is financed by foundations, corporations and individuals. It needs and deserves support and recognition.

Some Movement in Midst of Strike: Talk of a Rival League

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If major league baseball is prepared to fade from 1994 without a World Series, maybe it's ready for another new and unusual development: a new rival league. The baseball establishment hasn't had one since the Federal League lived briefly 80 years ago.
Given the monthlong strike that is on the verge of wiping out the rest of the baseball year and the prospect of a continued shutdown into next season, talk has stirred about the resuscitation of a plan that was looked at but didn't remain viable five years ago. A replacement league could be on the horizon. 
 "I've had many inquiries, and I'm convinced there are many well-established, capable people out there who would love to be involved in the baseball industry," said Richard Moss, who as general counsel of the players union for its first 10 years successfully took on the owner establishment in landmark cases.
"It's not a unique idea," he added. "Other people have talked about it. I don't know if anyone else is working on it. I think the players could be ready to play next April. That's all it takes."
When Donald Fehr, head of the players union, was asked about a new league, he said: "We'll have to look at any and all options. I haven't looked at anything yet."
 
From Delay to Cancellation
 Moss was a founder of the Baseball League, a venture that became a victim of circumstances in 1989 after a promising planning phase. Moss and his partner, David LeFevre, a New York lawyer, who also had connections to major league baseball, had lined up owners for eight teams and initially planned to begin play in 1990 but delayed the debut until 1991, then canceled their plans altogether.
"Collusion was over and players were being signed to long-term contracts," Moss said, explaining the problems the Baseball League encountered. "The economy went into serious decline, and real estate people were losing. A lot of the people in our venture were real estate people."
There also was the Donald factor.
Donald Trump was going to be one of the eight owners. "I have agreed to become a part of it," Trump said in August 1989, "to work with them and make this league a great success."
Meshulam Riklis, a friend of Trump and husband of Pia Zadora, was also set to own a team. But when the owners met in New York to plan the announcement of the creation of the league, Trump and Riklis did not show up. Shortly after the meeting began, their aides arrived and announced to the other owners and the founders that Trump and Riklis didn't think the league was ready to proceed to the next step.
 
Momentum Is Lost
 Their vacillation turned a stick of dynamite into a water-soaked firecracker. The league lost its momentum and never recovered.
But now Moss sees "another window of opportunity approaching, like a locomotive at full speed." To pick up speed, though, the train needs passengers in the form of players. Where would they come from? To a large extent from the existing major leagues, Moss suggested.
He classified major league players by their contract status:
*Those eligible for free agency or are released, not tendered contracts or not offered salary arbitration as one-time free agents with repeater restrictions. "They're clearly free," Moss said, estimating that 250 players would fit into that category.
*Those signed to multiyear contracts. Moss said their availability would have to be determined through litigation. "It will come down to how the owners' action is perceived," Moss said. "If they deliberately tried to create this situation and have not negotiated in good faith, there's a possibility you could get players out of those contracts."
*Those with less than six years of major league service and not eligible for free agency. "They would have to be litigated," Moss said, "but the only thing holding them is the reserve system. My view is the reserve system is an internal system, holding them to a club so they can't go to another in the system. It has nothing to do with another system."
If those players were added to a prospective player list, Moss said, about 550 would be free to move.
 
50 Percent Equity
 Besides maybe having the only game in town, Moss's new league may offer players another inducement: 50 percent equity, a 50 percent share of the profits and a 50 percent share in the decision-making process.
"If you ask players how they feel about a new system, a new league," said Moss, who also serves as an agent for players, "if my sampling is representative, you'll find 98 percent enthusiasm."
But a new league wouldn't be interested only in major league players, Moss added.
"We're not above considering some of the people presently involved in major league baseball," he said, meaning owners. "I can see a significant and profitable role Ted Turner could play, for example."
He didn't mention Donald Trump.
 
Don't Defend Cap, Miller Says
 Marvin Miller, the first leader of the baseball players union, has long been a critic of the players union in the National Football League. He never was impressed with the leadership of Ed Garvey in the 1970's, and he doesn't think much of the job Gene Upshaw did in taking his members under a salary cap. He also doesn't go for Upshaw's spirited defense of the cap.
"I realize they had a difficult situation," Miller said, referring to the football union's effort to gain meaningful free agency, "but be honest about it. Don't try to make a virtue out of a sin."
 
Warning-Track Power
 In an abbreviated season in which an average of 2.07 home runs were hit per game, Otis Nixon of Boston didn't hit one home run in 398 times at bat. No other hitter comes close for over-the-wall futility. Nixon is not new to this sort of thing. In 1991, playing for Atlanta, he went 401 at-bats without a home run. Last year he hit one home run in 461 at-bats.
Rey Sanchez of the Chicago Cubs has the second most at-bats, 291, without a home run this year. Last season he finished with none in 344 at-bats.
 
Tigers the Latest to Drop Hints
 It seems like every other team has used the Tampa Bay area as a threat so the Detroit Tigers might as well do it, too.
The Tigers, who are trying to induce the Michigan Legislature to help build a new stadium, apparently have made inquiries about the domed stadium in St. Petersburg and the Tampa Bay area. The club says it wants to stay in Detroit, but well, you never know.
By actual count, the Tigers would be the eighth team to try to move to the west coast of Florida or at least hint it might go there. The Giants came closest to actually making the move, leaving their hearts and bats in San Francisco in 1992 only after local owners stepped in and bought the team from Bob Lurie.
Earlier that year, Tampa Bay thought it might get the Seattle Mariners, but a Japanese-led group wound up buying the team from Jeff Smulyan.
In 1988, the Chicago White Sox appeared to be on their way to becoming the St. Petersburg White Sox until the Illinois Legislature, in a last-minute vote, agreed to build a new stadium in Chicago.
Later that year, a Tampa Bay group thought it had a deal to buy the Texas Rangers from Eddie Chiles, but a group of Texas investors came through with a deal that kept the Rangers at home.
In 1984, Tampa Bay investors bought 42 percent of the Minnesota Twins in anticipation of getting the team and moving it, but baseball officials persuaded them to sell the minority interest to Carl Pohlad with the promise they would be seriously considered for an expansion team.
The Oakland Athletics were the next target, in 1985, but the Athletics gained concessions from the Oakland mayor and stayed home.
In 1991, the area was a finalist for a National League expansion team, but the leading investors pulled out at a late hour, undermining any chance Tampa Bay had of getting a franchise.
The area has become so jaded that talk of the Tigers' interest, no matter how preliminary, has not generated much excitement.
 
Statistical Achievements
 Stats Inc. is one of those outfits concocting fantasy games for Rotisserie league types who need their daily fix of box score lines. But the statistical service is far more informative when it researches real live numbers and determines the significance of league offensive achievements this year.
The 10.45 runs per game scored by American League teams, for example, rank seventh in league history. The league's .273 batting average is its highest since 1939. The National League's .267 average is also its best since the same season.
 
At the Tone, Leave a Rhyme
 Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, uses a rhyming message to entertain callers to his home who get his answering machine. Changing the rhymes monthly, he offers this message for September:
This September's a month to dislike
What with players still forced out on strike
Yeah, and if you don't think
That the clubs caused this stink
At the tone you can go take a hike.

HEADLINE: Airport Fiasco Hastens New York's Decline

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposed multibillion-dollar monorail system between Kennedy International Airport and Manhattan's Upper East Side, which promises years of gridlock to go with its extravagant price tag while construction goes on and over the country's most crowded highways, is just the latest ploy by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to avoid providing a connection between our airports and the central city.
The Port Authority has been under a mandate to connect Kennedy and Newark Airports with this city by rail since 1962. This mandate is not a suggestion; it is the law. 
 Existing rights of way and existing high-speed rail lines could provide service directly to Pennsylvania Station, in both cases requiring a minimum of capital or disruption of the surrounding residential, industrial or highway environment, as well as direct connection to much of the region's transit system. Indeed, even La Guardia Airport is close to and easily connected with such a rail line.
Such practical action has never been and never will be pursued by the Port Authority. The agency's bondholders have an aversion to its undertaking any rail or transit project. New York and New Jersey codified this impediment to the Port Authority's usefulness by limiting its responsibility for rail projects beyond the PATH system to the two airport links.
This is the second absurdly expensive, environmentally disruptive and impractical airport connection project submitted by the Port Authority. The first was to serve Newark Airport by extending the PATH system to Plainfield, N.J. That extension beyond the airport, which would have inexplicably paralleled an existing commuter line, was not built.
From its success in avoiding build
ing any Newark Airport connection, the Port Authority knows an extravagant, impractical and disruptive airport connection will be soundly vetoed. It also knows the debate will exhaust proponents of a rational transit link, who will spend energy defeating such an absurd proposal. Voters and state officials will have little fight left to get the Port Authority to perform the task in any practical way.
The Port Authority will shrug its bureaucratic shoulders and blame New York for the continued isolation of its airports. Such air traffic as remains the Port Authority will move to Newark to join the port, removed to Newark Bay in the 1950's. As with the port, most of the country's international traffic will go elsewhere.
By avoiding its mandates, the Port Authority has thus presided over the dissolution of the port and industrial collapse of the city and of the region. Its inaction has produced the worst congestion in the country, the second highest levels of air pollution, the highest rates of unemployment and the least desirable site for industrial investment in the Western world.
Indeed it has made the greatest natural port in the Americas a maritime relic soon to be a commercial desert. Our airports are now following this pattern. This latest proposal should be taken as the final insult to this region's residents and a signal that the Port Authority should be dissolved.

HEADLINE: Every U.S. Interest Is at Stake in Haiti

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I believe the United States does indeed have compelling interests in restoring the democratically elected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti.
There is a strategic interest. The situation in Haiti cannot last. It is ripe for bloody revolt, and who knows what forces could come to power in such a crisis? It is clearly in the interests of the United States to prevent overtly anti-American factions from replacing the junta. 
 There is an economic interest. Haiti is an economic cipher, unable to buy or sell anything of real value. A stable, democratic Haiti, developing economically, could be a lively trade partner of the United States, bringing profit to both countries.
There is a political interest. If we expect democratic forces around the world to risk their lives transforming their countries into liberal democracies, we must demonstrate that we will stay with them when the going gets tough. The eyes of democrats worldwide are focused on Haiti.
Strategically, economically and politically, restoring democracy to Haiti is important to the United States. That should be enough to warrant effective action, military if need be.
However, there is also a moral imperative. Haitians are suffering unbelievably for the sin of choosing democracy. Rape, imprisonment, torture and murder are being visited daily on our democratic friends there because they are our friends. We can no longer turn a deaf ear to their cries for help.

HEADLINE: Rosa Parks Leads Again on Civil Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I take exception to your Sept. 1 editorial and Bob Herbert's Sept. 4 column, commenting on the mugging of the civil rights heroine Rosa Parks.
Mr. Herbert says "we are in the dark night of the post-civil rights era" and "have disgraced the legacy of Rosa Parks." He lays responsibility for ending the violence in urban slums upon the new leadership of the African-American community, who should "recapture the high ground" taken by Mrs. Parks and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. when they originated the nonviolent civil rights movement in 1955. 
 Is it not asking too much of a people abused for centuries, and still deprived of the economic means to realize the equality promised by the civil rights movement, to continue to take the "high ground"? What about the role of the white community?
What position has the majority of white Americans taken on ending crime? For the crime bill to pass, crime prevention funds had to be cut. When Congress passed the "Move to Opportunity" law, suburban white communities (in Baltimore County, for example), objected to sharing their socially healthy environment with as few as 285 black families.
It is the poverty in America's slums that creates the breeding ground for crime. It is the greed that motivates the drug kingpins that makes junkies out of black youth.
Dr. King saw the handwriting on the wall when he began the March on Poverty in 1968. Some, like Myles Horton, Mrs. Parks's Highlander Folk School teacher, and mine, have wondered aloud whether Dr. King's assassination wasn't linked to his move to fight for economic rights for African-Americans. His step was the logical sequel to the civil rights movement -- the earthy ground that needs to be taken by the new black leaders.
Had Dr. King lived and the movement for economic rights continued, it is quite possible that the vicious violence of our times would not have developed. This is the significance of Rosa Parks's victimization by a violent black man. There is a connection between the positive zeitgeist of the civil rights movement she initiated and the present "mean and violent zeitgeist that is at work in our country." Rosa Parks once again awakens our national consciousness to the need for wide-reaching social change.
Frail yet strong she is the symbol of the unfinished civil rights movement.

HEADLINE: The French Keep Africa Under Wing

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Nine months after France, as a spur to economic reform, devalued a West African currency it had long supported, foreign businessmen and diplomats say that Paris is sending ambivalent signals to its former colonies over their efforts to open up to more international investment and trade.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France has said the devaluation was an attempt to reinsert Africa "in the grand commercial currents of the world." The International Monetary Fund and others had called for a devaluation of the currency, the African franc, which is used by 11 countries in the region. 
 But while France has urged the countries to open their economies, many people here say that it has shown little willingness to make room for other influences in an area where its hold remains powerful after more than three decades of independence.
 
French Presence Remains
 France's reach in its former colonial empire can be seen in everything from the symbolic to the concrete. In countries like Ivory Coast, Senegal and Gabon, boulevards are named for every French president since de Gaulle and French troops train their African counterparts and serve as the ultimate republican guard.
Throughout this region, experts sent from Paris supervise services from the police to the postal service. And until Mr. Balladur recently put a stop to the practice, timely French financial assistance helped assure stability by paying civil servants when governments were hard pressed to meet payrolls.
And decades of carefully cultivated ties and oversight of African affairs have meant that French companies were almost certain to enjoy a decisive leg up whenever major international contracts were being awarded.
 
Private Reserve
 In international business circles, France's advantages in its former African colonies earned this region the reputation of being Paris's chasse gardee, or private game reserve.
The exchange rate for the African franc, fixed at a value of 50 to 1 against the French currency from 1948 until its value was cut in half early this year, gave Paris another strong commercial advantage over other exporters to this region.
Since the devaluation, however, Paris has grown anxious as West Africans have begun scrambling in search of the best deal, rather than automatically looking to France. "The days when all roads ran through the former metropolis are over," wrote the French daily Liberation.
 
Protecting Markets
 Hoping to protect long-cozy markets, the French have been scrambling. In an effort to head off African pharmacists seeking medicines from lower-cost suppliers in Europe and Asia, for example, the French Government recently began encouraging the export of generic medicines to the continent for the first time.
Businessmen and diplomats in Ivory Coast and elsewhere tell of mysterious port delays holding up the arrival of new Canadian telecommunications gear and discreet political intervention from Paris urging that a major cocoa trading concern here not be sold into American hands.
No recent case has drawn more attention than that of an independent American oil company, United Meridian, which in March discovered enough oil and natural gas offshore here to meet this country's fuel needs, and perhaps eventually allow it to become a small exporter.
 
French Challenge
 A French group led by the civil engineering company Bouygues had rights to an adjacent field, and nurtured hopes of building a pipeline to the coast, where it would install turbines to generate electricity from the natural gas offshore. Bouygues, which already controls the national electricity and water companies, and is believed to be interested in Ivory Coast's telephone business as well, has long enjoyed close ties to the Ivorian political elite and diplomatic support from Paris.
"We felt we could negotiate with them and sell them gas from our well, which was ready to produce," said Steve Thornton, director of United Meridian's Ivory Coast operations. "Their response was, 'Thank you, but you have no right to exploit gas in the Ivory Coast.' "
Several people with knowledge of the dispute said that what ensued was a fullcourt press by the French company, supported by France's diplomatic machine, aimed at shoving the American company out of the picture. Ivory Coast's new President, Henri Konan Bedie , was invited to Paris as one of a select few foreign guests to review French troops on Bastille Day. "Had this deal gone sour, I think it would have been the kiss of death for American interest in this country," a Western diplomat said.
In the end, United Meridian won out over its French rival, but not before what many said was rare support from the State Department and Energy Department in Washington. Also not before Bouygues was itself awarded a contract to go ahead with its gas turbines, which will be fueled from the American-developed field.
"Its kind of like an empty-nest syndrome," one diplomat here said of France's protective actions. "Your child is finally going away to college. You know that's what's best for him, but you just can't deal with it."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Restored Tibetan Palace Opens Amid Controversy

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
AFTER a five-year restoration that has drawn protests from human-rights groups and Tibetan dissidents, the Potala Palace in Lhasa, among the holiest structures in Tibet and the former home of the Dalai Lama, reopened to tourists last month.
The $7 million restoration of the 17th-century hilltop palace is the centerpiece of the Chinese Government's campaign to expand tourism in Tibet, the "Rooftop of the World," which China invaded in 1950 and later annexed. 
 Government leaders have talked of increasing tourism threefold in Tibet, which remains one of the most impoverished regions of China. About 23,000 foreign tourists, many of them Western mountaineers seeking to explore the Himalayas, visited Tibet last year.
Tibet has been periodically shaken by violent anti-Chinese protests since the 1950's, and the spiritual leader of the nation, the Dalai Lama, has lived in exile since 1959,
when he fled after a failed uprising against Beijing.
Human-rights groups have documented widespread abuses in Tibet, and they have suggested that attempts to revive the Tibetan economy through tourism are really an effort by the Chinese to entice non-Tibetans to settle there, in hopes of diluting the political and cultural influence of native Tibetans.
Dissidents have also suggested that the restoration is a Chinese ploy to insure that the 13-story, 1,000-room palace is never again used as a staging area for protests by Tibetan nationalists and dissident monks.
The Chinese Government has acknowledged that the restoration team installed an elaborate security system in the palace, including closed-circuit surveillance cameras and alarms, to protect it from "hooligans."
"We get a lot of reports from Tibetans who are very uncomfortable about this project," said Robert Barnett, director of the Tibet Information Network, a London-based human-rights group. "We hear reports that valuable objects have disappeared from the palace during the restoration, that murals have been damaged."
The Chinese insist that nothing of value has been removed or damaged.
Whatever their concern that tourism tends to bolster Chinese control, major human-rights groups do not discourage foreign travelers from visiting Tibet.
Because reporters are generally barred from visiting the region, foreign tourists and business people provide the best -- and often the only -- means of getting information in and out. "I think the Tibetans would be quite worried if there weren't any tourism," said Mr. Barnett.
That has produced its own set of problems for foreign visitors, who occasionally find themselves the victims of intense police surveillance during visits to Tibet.
In June, two American tourists on a group tour were detained by the Chinese police in Shigatse, Tibet's second-largest city, and interrogated for four days after they gave a monk a tape-recording of a speech by the Dalai Lama.
According to the two Americans, their passports were confiscated, their room was searched and two other copies of the tape and seven photographs of the exiled Tibetan leader were impounded by the Chinese police before the Americans were deported to Nepal.
As part of its campaign to increase tourism to Tibet, the Chinese Government announced last month that it would ease visa restrictions for visitors wishing to enter Tibet directly from Nepal.
In preparation for a tourist influx, the Chinese Government has also completed a $30 million restoration of the Gongkar Airport in Lhasa, the capital, by expanding the runway to allow jumbo jets to land, and is trying to encourage major hotel chains to consider building international-standard hotels in Lhasa and elsewhere. Tourists to Tibet will find international standards of comfort in only one hotel, a Holiday Inn in Lhasa.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST RIVER PARK: The Ups and Downs (and Ups) of a 57-Acre Dream Park;
Decrepit Stage Becomes Tragedy Itself

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
On a mild summer night in 1956, Joseph Papp presented "Julius Caesar" against the backdrop of the East River and the Williamsburg Bridge.
The following year, the New York Shakespeare Festival found a home in Central Park, but the East River Park Amphitheater went on to even greater glory, as the site of free Evenings-by-the-River, a summer concert series that drew several personal appearances by its honorary chairwoman, Eleanor Roosevelt. 
 But for much of its 50-year history, the 2,500-seat amphitheater has stood empty. Today it is a hulking wreck, piled with rubble, cast-off clothing, plastic containers and rusty car parts, waiting for demolition or a miracle.
The open concrete theater was built in 1941 as part of an urban renewal project for the Lower East Side, said Jonathan Kuhn, the curator of monuments and historian for the Parks Department. In addition to the bandshell and stage, there was a limestone recreation building with space for theatrical productions, sometimes used when open-air events were rained out.
But the amphitheater was rarely used until the 1950's, said Mr. Kuhn. Then, not only did Papp and Mrs. Roosevelt use it, but local schools found it perfect for their graduation exercises, and the Group of Ancient Drama gave free performances of the Greek classics.
In 1973, faced with worsening budget problems, the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay closed the amphitheater, turning it from a town hall into a vandals' target. There was no budget for maintenance to stop the site's deterioration.
There was a glimmer of hope in the early 80's. First, the East River Park Amphitheater Restoration Corporation, a coalition of neighborhood groups, obtained $15,000 in grants for a feasibility study, said the corporation's director, Rafael Jaquez, who now teaches at Columbia University's School of Public Health. The group landscaped the area and made pilot presentations of theater, dance and music in the amphitheater.
In 1981, Mr. Papp contributed $5,000 for cosmetic repairs, Mr. Jaquez said. At that time, the Board of Estimate allocated $1.5 million for capital improvement of the amphitheater, he said, but the Parks Department stipulated that local organizations be responsible for the yearly maintenance, about $300,000.
But the restoration group was unable to come up with the money, Mr. Jaquez said, and the capital financing was reallocated to other parks projects. In a last-ditch effort, when the theater itself was condemned, a few die-hard supporters staged performances on the lawn outside.
"Now we'd like them to level the recreation building and just keep the bandshell in a green space, with maybe some food concessions," Mr. Jaquez said. "But I'm afraid demolition costs almost as much as restoration today." M.H.

NO ORDINARY TIME
Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt:
The Home Front in World War II.
By Doris Kearns Goodwin.
Illustrated. 759 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $30. 
TWO great events convulsed American society in the middle decades of the 20th century: the New Deal and World War II. Taken together, they produced what Doris Kearns Goodwin rightly calls "the most profound social revolution in the country since the Civil War -- nothing less than the creation of modern America." Historians continue to argue about the relative importance of those two distinct developments in shaping the character of American life in the post-1945 era.
And behind that historical debate lurks a philosophical question about the relationship of will and fate: does conscious human striving, as represented in the deliberate policies of the New Deal, count for more in determining the human condition than unwilled events, like the war, that simply befall us? Are we the masters of our own souls or the creatures of historical forces beyond our control?
In "No Ordinary Time" Ms. Goodwin, who has explored some titanic individual wills in her previous books, "Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream" and "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," seems to agree with those scholars who see World War II as working even more far-reaching transformations in midcentury American life than the New Deal. Yet by employing the biographical approach she so artfully used in her previous books, she seeks to defend the importance of individual effort as well -- especially Eleanor Roosevelt's struggle to wring gains for social justice out of the turbulent changes on the war's home front. "No Ordinary Time" is an ambitiously conceived and imaginatively executed participants'-eye view of the United States in the war years, though at times the private lives of Ms. Goodwin's famous participants loom larger than the war itself.
"This book," Ms. Goodwin writes, "is the story of that home front, told through the lives of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the circle of friends and associates who lived with them in the family quarters of the White House during World War II." What a circle it was! At one or another time during the war the Roosevelt household sheltered Crown Princess Martha of Norway; Franklin's secretary, Marguerite (Missy) LeHand; the lend-lease administrator and all-purpose Roosevelt high factotum Harry Hopkins; Eleanor's sometime companion Lorena Hickok; and Joseph Lash, Eleanor's youthful wartime protege and later her worshipful biographer.
The complex geometry of their relationships gave to the wartime White House the air of a Borgia court, or perhaps an Ottoman seraglio. Ms. Goodwin opens one chapter with successive accounts of Franklin's intimacy with Missy LeHand; Eleanor's obsession with Joseph Lash; Eleanor's passionate friendship with the journalist Lorena Hickok; Franklin's trysts with Princess Martha; Hickok's infatuation with her new lesbian lover, and Hopkins's amorous pursuit of Louise Macy, a socialite. Scarcely missing a beat, the author effortlessly segues to a discussion of B-17 production and the Battle of Midway.
This kind of shuttling between public events and the innermost lives of her principals is at once a weakness and a strength of Ms. Goodwin's book. At times it threatens to submerge the sublime in the ridiculous, as the narrative snaps suddenly back and forth from historical documentary to salacious soap opera. But for the most part, the biographical technique serves her well. It yields exceptionally readable accounts of such potentially numbing subjects as wartime tax reform and labor disputes, and enlivens her analysis of topics ranging from military strategy, race relations and women's changing employment patterns to controversies over refugee policy and civilian versus military claims on economic production.
"No Ordinary Time" is no ordinary book. It rests on prodigious research in archival and oral history sources. "I treasure the details that emerged from these primary sources," Ms. Goodwin reports. She shares those details profligately with the reader, from descriptions of Franklin's dental bridge and Winston Churchill's bare backside to the contents of the wardroom lockers on the destroyers that the United States handed over to the British in 1940 in exchange for leases on North American base sites: "tinned asparagus, corn, chipped beef, clams, instant coffee, tomato juice and pumpkins." Indeed, the expression "lavish detail" is inadequate to describe this book's technique. It might better be described as relying on sumptuous detail, extravagant detail, rococo detail. So huge is the Niagara of facts that the reader braces when informed that some 6,000 registrants drew number 158 in the 1940 lottery for the country's first peacetime draft; mercifully, Ms. Goodwin names only 11 of them.
But despite its occasional excesses, "No Ordinary Time" provides an engrossing picture of the World War II era. The sheer abundance of colorful biographical anecdotes and the cumulative weight of telling detail sustain an atmosphere of immediacy and leave a lastingly vivid impression of what the war looked like from the perspective of some centrally involved participants.
No participants, of course, were more central to the drama than Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. Their story lies at the heart of Ms. Goodwin's account. Eleanor, "whose primary concern was the home front, not the war," appears in these pages as the voice of conscience, trying to preserve New Deal liberalism amid the urgent crises of the war. Franklin, preoccupied with diplomacy and strategy, is cast as the wily politico, bedding down for the duration with his erstwhile big-business adversaries and replacing "Dr. New Deal" with "Dr. Win-the-War," in his characteristically homey phrase.
Eleanor pressured Franklin to pursue more liberal policies toward European refugees, especially Jews fleeing the Holocaust. She championed the cause of labor. She spoke out on behalf of women in the war industries. She constantly pleaded with her husband to seek better treatment for black Americans, prompting Secretary of War Henry Stimson to condemn her "intrusive and impulsive folly." "I sometimes acted as a spur," Eleanor wrote in her autobiography, "This I Remember," "even though the spurring was not always wanted or welcome."
Nor was it always effective. Sometimes she successfully bent the President's ear, as in her pleas on behalf of black Americans; sometimes not, as in her failure to change refugee policy. Yet when she took stock of the massive transformations the war had occasioned -- opening new opportunities for women in the workplace, liberating millions of blacks from virtual peonage in the sleepy backwater of the Cotton Belt and fueling the explosive growth of the South and West -- Eleanor eventually acknowledged "that the nation had taken even greater strides toward social justice during the war than it had during the New Deal." It remains debatable, however, whether it was her conscientious spurring or simply the random disruptions of the war -- or Franklin's own initiative -- that made those strides possible.
"While Eleanor thought in terms of what should be done, Franklin thought in terms of what could be done," Ms. Goodwin writes. "She was more earnest, less devious, less patient, less fun, more uncompromisingly moral; he possessed the more trustworthy political talent, the more finely tuned sense of timing, the better feel for the citizenry, the smarter understanding of how to get things done."
This dichotomous image of Eleanor and Franklin can be overdone. Franklin needed little wifely encouragement, for example, to attend to the well-being of labor, the constituency on which his political fortunes largely rested. And Eleanor could at times lend herself to the most nakedly political of ploys, as when she agreed to Franklin's request that she intercede with the black labor leader A. Philip Randolph in the spring of 1941 to stop a march on Washington on behalf of equal employment opportunity in defense plants. "I was one of those," Eleanor concluded late in life about her relation with Franklin, "who served his purposes."
The bloody clashes on countless battlefields, the delicate dance of allied diplomacy, the struggles for military supremacy abroad and for economic production and social justice at home -- all these episodes are fetchingly and even brilliantly recounted in the pages of "No Ordinary Time." But as the book progresses, history yields to biography. In the end, the most intriguing thread in Ms. Goodwin's complex narrative fabric is the story of the Roosevelts' marriage; high public dramas recede into the background as the intimately personal story of Eleanor and Franklin grinds to its desolate conclusion. It is a tale that has been told before, but rarely with as much effect and poignancy as here.
FRANKLIN'S affair with Lucy Mercer during World War I had permanently altered the terms of the Roosevelts' marriage. Thereafter they were partners in politics but not companions of the heart. Much of the biographical material Ms. Goodwin has excavated documents the ceaseless strivings of both Roosevelts to fill their respective emotional voids. The wartime White House, she writes, was "the site of the irrepressible renewal of love and desire." Her portrait of Franklin is especially affecting. When his attachment to Missy LeHand (to whom he bequeathed half of his estate) was terminated by her illness, his dalliance with Princess Martha was ended and his friendship with Harry Hopkins was attenuated by Hopkins's marriage, he turned again to Eleanor. Ms. Goodwin touchingly describes two moments during the war, in 1942 and again in 1944, when Franklin "approached Eleanor with the idea that they should try once more to live as man and wife." But her "inability to forget" doomed Franklin's overtures to failure.
He resumed his liaison with Lucy Mercer, and it was she, not Eleanor, who was with him when he died at Warm Springs, Ga., on April 12, 1945. Jolted into a new self-awareness by Franklin's earlier infidelity, Eleanor had long since created a different, independent life for herself, and she would not abandon it. "Indeed," Ms. Goodwin writes, in a sobering conclusion about Eleanor's psychological priorities, "had she been given the choice between supplying the relaxation for her husband that Lucy was providing or summoning her powers to effect a change in the lives of Negro Americans, she would undoubtedly have chosen the latter."
In the final pages of this book, Franklin Roosevelt, broken in health, isolated as much by the history of his marriage as by the burdens of office, appears unspeakably lonely. So too does Eleanor. She still loved Franklin, Ms. Goodwin insists, but could no longer touch his soul, nor be touched by his. Even at the moment of his death, Eleanor confessed that she had "an almost impersonal feeling," which she attributed to the fact that "much further back I had had to face certain difficulties" -- a scarcely veiled reference to the old Lucy Mercer affair. "I was lost somewhere deep down inside myself," she wrote in her autobiography. The same might be said of Franklin. The constricting hand of history reached even here, to the inner cloisters of the heart.

Vail's New Darwinians: Even Leisure Turns Pro

BYLINE: By ALEX MARKELS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VAIL, Colo., Sept. 10

 BODY:
It was the quintessential Vail date. In a town where the skiing is the predominant social institution and dinner-and-a-movie evenings are rare, Mike Harvey invited his new flame, Lanell Avery, to compete on July 3 in the Vail Hill Climb, the annual 10-kilometer run that rises 3,000 grueling feet up the side of Vail Mountain. As usual, more than 600 residents, about a quarter of the town's permanent population, showed up to compete.
Mr. Harvey, 31, and his svelte companion jockeyed for a starting position at the front of the pack and began to jog. 
 "I haven't run in this big of a crowd in years," Mr. Harvey, who was competing in the race for the first time, said.
"The last time I did anything like this was the New York Marathon," Ms. Avery, a local entrepreneur, replied.
Mr. Harvey gulped. The New York Marathon? Though he works as a sales manager at Vail's chic Cascade Athletic Club and considers himself something of a hardbody, he suddenly envisioned his worst nightmare: getting dusted by his date. Pumping up his pride, he finished the race at her side, though thoroughly winded.
Romance is like everything else in this high-powered ski town. "If you can't keep up, don't bother showing up," said Kristen Coil, a resident whose choices in boyfriends lean heavily toward the toned and the fleet. "We work hard, we play hard and we party hard. A lot of people can't deal with that."
Unlike rival ski towns like nearby Aspen, whose past as an old silver mining town is integral to its hip image, Vail remained a sleepy backwater until the ski resort's founding by Vail Associates in 1960. That group has turned a valley inhabited by sheepherders and lettuce growers into the largest ski resort in Colorado. Originally dubbed "Shake 'n Bake Bavaria" for the fake Alpine architecture the founders used to fabricate an ambiance, Vail now defines itself by the competitive zeal its residents bring to nearly everything they do.
When the resort managers chose mountain biking as a way to attract more summer visitors, they immediately set about securing the sport's premier event, the World Mountain Bike Championships, which will begin on Tuesday and will continue through next Sunday on Vail Mountain. "Why go for the No. 2 event when we can go for No. 1?" said John Garnsey, who headed the campaign to secure the event for the Vail Valley Foundation, a private nonprofit group that promotes cultural and sports events. "Vailites want the best."
Nowhere is Vail's competitive bent more evident than in the successful campaign to bring in the 1999 World Alpine Skiing Championships, which is second only to the Winter Olympics as the most important ski-racing event. Going head-to-head with its more formal European rivals at the site-selection conference last spring in Rio de Janeiro, the Vail contingent -- including everyone from the town's Mayor to Vail Associates' chairman -- filled a promotional booth with cowboy gear and went about wooing votes by offering tastes of medallions of elk and lessons in country-and-western line dancing. Organizers had already scored a public-relations coup last winter, when Hillary Rodham Clinton donned a Vail '99 jacket while attending the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.
"We've always been very goal-oriented here," said Peter Seibert, 70, Vail Associates' founder. "And when you exude that, you draw more and more people who fit that personality type."
To be sure, Vail has a history of attracting the powerful. The list of the resort's original partners reads like a Who's Who of American industry, including the chairmen of I.B.M., Kellogg's and Motorola. Their $10,000-apiece investment in 1960, which bought 2 acres of land, 100 shares of stock and 4 lifetime season ski passes, paid off: each stake is now worth more than $1 million.
Of course, wealth begets wealth, and heavy hitters like Henry R. Kravis, the financier, and Peter A. Cohen, the former chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman Hutton, built lavish second homes here. And politicians like former President Gerald R. Ford, Ross Perot and Jack F. Kemp, who also have homes here, have found gushing support among Vail's conservative elite.
"What Aspen is to Hollywood, Vail is to Wall Street," said Jerry Jones, who helped Vail's founders market the resort to a select group of newcomers.
Even the ski bums who move here are Type A's. "The young guy who goes to Telluride or Crested Butte has probably heard so much from his old man about getting a job and succeeding that he just wants to go somewhere and hang out," Mr. Seibert said. "The guy who comes to Vail is a bit more career-oriented, at least in the back of his mind."
And those who arrive here as ski bums often become infected with the entrepreneurial spirit. New businesses, many of which cater to Vail's rich and time-strapped second-home owners, seem to sprout like wildflowers, bolstering a local economy that's become one of the fastest-growing in the state.
In Vail, ambition takes many forms. This, after all, is a town where more than 500 residents race in a highly competitive weekly mountain-bike series and dozens of superfit men and women juggle professional bike-racing careers in the summer and professional mogul skiing in winter.
"The level of athleticism is unparalleled," said Davis Phinney, a bicylist who won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics. He now runs an annual summer cycling camp in Vail with his wife, Connie Carpenter, a bicyclist who won a gold medal in 1984. "I avoid the bike club's training rides because I know I'll get shellacked."
Vail residents have even elevated relaxation to a competitive level. Members of the renowned Lawn Chair Drill Team handle lounge chairs with the same precision as soldiers handling rifles. "We'll challenge anyone to a competition," said Josh Hall, 40, who marched with the team in President Clinton's inaugural parade. "We've got muscles in places these all-American runners and skiers just can't imagine."
Craig Campbell, the leader of the drill team, added: "In a regular town, the competition is over who has the biggest house or the best job. But here, it's all based around who's the best at recreating: who skis the most days or bikes the most miles. The drill team kind of fits right into that. We call it the 'Pro Leisure Tour,' and we get a lot of points for being on the team."
Attendance at ski-conditioning classes each fall is worth big points, too, if you can survive. Led through a strenuous series of workout stations by a team of trainers and professional mogul skiers, enthusiasts at the Cascade Athletic Club drop like flies as the sessions stretch on. "It's like boot camp here," said Annegret Howe, a nutritionist at the Vail Valley Medical Center who quit the ski classes after a few weeks. "Between the power lunges, the plyometrics and the suicide sprints, you've got to be a superwoman just to keep up."
And where does that leave the rest of the pack? Melodee Crawford, who manages the T. Lame clothing store, has found that Vail's hardbodies have little patience with laggards.
"I was going out with this guy, but he dumped me after we went skiing," she said. "He told me: 'You've got the basics down, but you're just not good enough. So our relationship isn't going to last.' I was appalled."

HEADLINE: Forget PCB's. Radon. Alar

BYLINE: By Gregg Easterbrook; Gregg Easterbrook is a contributing editor to Newsweek and The Atlantic Monthly. His book on the environment, "A Moment on the Earth," will be published next year.

 BODY:
WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS kill human beings in huge numbers today? Not ozone depletion or Alar. What kills them is dung smoke and diarrhea.
Throughout the world, many more people die each year from filthy air and dirty water than from asbestos, dioxin, electromagnetic radiation, nuclear wastes, PCB's, pesticide residues and ultraviolet rays -- the sorts of ecological issues that obsess Western environmentalists. Problems like dioxin and nuclear wastes are real enough and must be dealt with. But Western public consciousness and environmental groups continue to focus on such issues while all but ignoring millions of annual deaths from polluted air and water. 
 Dangerous air levels have become almost unknown in the West, but 1.3 billion people in the developing world live in zones of dangerously unsafe air. According to the World Health Organization, last year 4 million third-world children under the age of 5 died from acute respiratory disease, brought on in most cases by air pollution. This is about as many people of all ages who died of all causes that year in the United States and the European Union combined.
Urban air pollution is worse in Calcutta, Lagos and Mexico City than in any Western metropolis, including Los Angeles. The developing world also has an insidious form of air pollution unknown in the West: rural smog. "Most of the four million annual child deaths from respiratory distress stem from children living in poorly ventilated huts where fuel wood, cow dung or agricultural wastes are used for heating and cooking," says Gurinder Shahi, an official of the United Nations Development Program.
In the third world, polluted air is more than matched by polluted water. Some one billion people lack access to drinking water that meets the crudest safety standards. Unicef reports that 3.8 million developing-world children under age 5 died last year from diarrheal diseases caused mostly by impure drinking water. In the West, diarrheal deaths are practically unknown; in the developing world, diarrhea kills far more people than cancer.
Most of Africa, the Indian subcontinent and Latin America have no waste-water treatment facilities; raw human and industrial sewage is discharged directly into the same bodies of water used for drinking. Mothers draw for their children water of lower quality than the process effluent discharged from American factories. In India, ritual bathers enter the Ganges seeking spiritual purity while exposing their bodies to a wide range of toxicants and pathogens. In China, an estimated 25 billion tons of unfiltered industrial pollutants went directly into the waterways in 1991, which means there was more toxic water pollution in that one country than in the whole of the Western world.
Yet such problems do not seem to be on the priority lists of Western environmentalists. "Things like African sewage are not sexy issues, so they always fall to the bottom of the agenda," says Deborah Moore, a staff scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund and one of the few Western environmentalists advocating a focus on basic third-world reform.
A large faction within the environmental movement concentrates on the comparatively minor ecological problems of developed nations in order to support the view that Western materialism is the root of all ecological malevolence. The low point of such thinking was reached at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. There, institutional environmental groups got the attention of the world and its heads of state, but what message did they choose to proclaim? That global warming is a horror. The sole environmental area in which the United States is the leading malefactor is carbon dioxide emission, which contributes to the greenhouse effect; in virtually every other ecological category, America is the world leader in progress.
To make Rio a fashionably negative event about Western guilt-tripping and America-bashing, the prospect of global warming was put above the urgent loss of lives in the third world from water and air pollution. Rio concluded with Western leaders' agreeing to devote billions of dollars to controlling global warming, while not lifting a finger for the 7.8 million poor children who die each year mainly from what they drink and breathe.
ERIC CHIVIAN IS A psychiatrist on the faculty of Harvard Medical School. In the days of the arms race, he helped found International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which in 1985 won the Nobel Peace Prize. When nuclear weapons began to be dismantled, Chivian enlarged his agenda to include pollution in the developing world. He has started a new program, the Project on Global Environmental Change and Health, and last year edited a powerful but little noticed technical book, "Critical Condition: Human Health and the Environment."
Chivian finds that he can hardly get anyone interested in his new group. "I've had great difficulty interesting environmental organizations in human health in poor countries," he says. "They all want to talk about forest loss and species diversity in the South" -- the developing world -- "but have much less interest in human health there."
Last year, notes Chivian, two teams of university researchers produced evidence that particulates -- fine bits of soot and ash caused by incomplete combustion -- were a much greater health threat than was previously realized. In the United States each year, particulates may account for 20,000 to 30,000 premature deaths due to respiratory failure. "Environmentalists in the United States were disturbed by this finding," Chivian says. "But if these studies are right, then the particulate emergency is happening in the third world, not here. The problem is a thousand times worse for them than for us."
Under American law, particulates have long been closely regulated. Most developing nations do not regulate particulate emissions, even though the factories and vehicles in these countries employ the sort of inefficient engines likely to emit more soot. According to David Bates, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of British Columbia, airborne particulate readings 10 times higher than peak allowable American levels are common in the developing world. Within dwellings heated by wood or dung, particulates are higher still. A child's lungs are more sensitive than an adult's and, Bates points out, children in the developing world face heavy doses of air pollutants whether they live in the city or the country.
"If a developing-world child lives in a city," Bates says, "that child will be exposed to high levels of airborne lead from vehicle exhaust, since no third-world country is even close to mandating unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters." (Lead is a poison linked to I.Q. loss.) Since unleaded gasoline went on the market in the mid-1970's, ambient airborne lead levels in the United States have fallen 95 percent. During the same time, airborne lead levels have risen in developing-world cities where only leaded gasoline is burned. Lead is now so prevalent in Mexico City air that parents are advised to keep young children indoors as much as possible.
"The city child in the developing world will also be exposed to high levels of airborne sulfur and smog," Bates says. Poor nations lack the factory emissions controls found in the West, do not require catalytic converters on vehicles and allow fuel stations to sell gasoline and diesel far too dirty to meet Western refinery standards. For example, in the Indian industrial city of Agra (home to the Taj Mahal), levels of airborne sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, are 10 times higher than the maximum found in the United States.
"But at least the child in the developing-world city has electricity and propane as home energy, sparing constant indoor exposure to smoke," Bates continues. "In the country, the child is spared sulfur and lead in the air, but then gets the choking home air pollution from the wood or dung fire."
ROBERT S. LAWRENCE, DIRECTOR of health sciences for the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, draws a chart of developing-world home fuels. In it, a slope starts with dung and crop wastes, moves past wood, charcoal, kerosene and propane, and ascends to electricity. "Through the early 1980's," Lawrence says, "many third-world countries were headed up the slope of cleaner fuels. In recent years, with the global economy stagnant, people are sliding back down the slope, from electricity back to propane, from fuel wood back to dung. Respiratory deaths are rising in concert."
Sliding down the slope from clean fuels isn't just a threat to human lungs. It threatens forests as well. Though environmental orthodoxy holds that third-world deforestation is caused by rapacious clear-cutters and ruthless cattle barons, penniless peasants seeking fuel wood may be the greatest threat to forests. Fuel wood consumption in the developing world rose 35 percent between 1975 and 1986, with replanting rare by peasants. Jodi Jacobson, director of the Health and Development Policy Project, an environmental organization, believes fuel wood supplies are becoming critical in Haiti, India, Nepal, Mexico, sub-Saharan Africa and Thailand. A new saying among rural Indian women, Jacobson says, is "It's not what's in the pot but what's under the pot that worries you."
In many developing countries, women do the wood gathering, just as they do most of the heavy labor. Gurinder Shahi, of the U.N. Development Program, estimates that in Nepal rural women spend five or six hours a day on foot searching for fuel wood and carrying it home. Such labors deny them the time for education and result in health damage to themselves and their children. In the high-altitude mountain areas of Nepal -- places many people presume are pristine wonderlands -- women, Bates notes, often suffer from a disease similar to anemia. The illness is caused by carbon monoxide in the bloodstream, a result of long-term exposure to crude energy sources like indoor cooking fires.
WESTERN ENVIRONMENTAL thinking has great difficulty coming to terms with such realities. That third-world economists would call propane and kerosene "clean fuels," and speak longingly of the day when their countries are wholly electrified like the West, horrifies Western environmentalists, or enviros, as they are known in Washington. According to ecological orthodoxy, fossil fuels are hideous and central electric generation promotes an artificial greenhouse effect.
What developing nations need to free their populations from death by extreme air pollution is hydroelectric dams, advanced petroleum refining installations, high-efficiency power plants for the clean combustion of coal. But Western environmental lobbies oppose nearly all new central energy production facilities for the developing world, especially hydroelectric plants. Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and other major environmental advocacy groups are pressuring Washington, Tokyo, Paris, London, Bonn and the World Bank not to support the Three Gorges and Xiaolangdi dams in China; the Narmada River dams in India; the Bio-Bio River dams in Chile, and power dams proposed for Malawi, Pakistan and elsewhere. In most cases the campaigns have succeeded. The World Bank, for example, recently withdrew from the Narmada project.
The principal objection to hydroelectric power is that reservoirs are formed by inundating pristine areas, sometimes including the habitats of rare wildlife. This does happen, even though planned dams for the Yangtze River in China and for the Narmada River Valley in India would also stop seasonal downstream flooding, which annually kills hundreds to thousands of people and destroys wildlife habitats.
Enviros correctly object to third-world hydropower initiatives' having budgets bloated by graft and involving displacement of peasants, which in developing nations always means more hardships. Yet they seem uninterested in the upside of such projects -- mainly, huge amounts of zero-emission, zero-fossil-fuel energy for nations where runaway air pollution is a daily threat to life. While passionately concerned about wildlife habitat losses from hydroelectric plants, enviros seem indifferent to the clear health benefits deriving from a reduction in indoor smoke.
Similarly, many enviros oppose oil field development in countries like Ecuador, and are fighting the construction of new coal-fired power plants -- even ones that employ advanced antipollution equipment -- in China and elsewhere. Enviros contend that small-scale solar energy and "bio-gas" (dung fermented into methane, a clean fuel) are appropriate for the developing world. Often this is true. But how many Western enviros are willing to live at the limits of current solar technology? Today's solar converters can provide basic power requirements, but they usually do not provide enough wattage for refrigeration, which is badly needed in developing countries. (About a quarter of third-world food production is lost to spoilage.)
One reason few environmentalists go solar is that it costs more than conventional electricity from big generating stations. Prices for solar converters have been falling, but solar cell systems still cost four to five times as much per new kilowatt-hour as fossil fuel systems, even ones with advanced pollution controls. And if small solar is too expensive for the Sierra Club set, why is it a great idea for peasants in Malawi?
Many enviros think the need for improved water purity can be dealt with in small ways. Deborah Moore, of the Environmental Defense Fund, and groups like Unicef have been pressuring development agencies to fund community-based water-purity and sewage-control programs. As with small solar, there are many instances in which small water projects will provide the best returns. But in the expanding third-world cities where a billion of the world's poor reside, small is hardly the solution.
In Karachi, only a third of the homes have piped water. In Madras, only about a third of dwellings connect to anything like a sewer system. In Kinshasa, there is no sewage system at all. The situation for numerous other third-world cities is the same. Often, the poor of developing cities must get safe drinking water from water-sellers. The poorest of the world's poor therefore end up paying more for water than do the rich.
What is needed, Chivian says, is "basic water infrastructure" -- pipes, filtration plants, waste-water treatment facilities, sometimes dams and aqueducts. Such big water-diversion projects, however, offend environmental orthodoxy.
WHY ARE SO MANY ENVIROS paying more attention to greenhouse computer projections for the 21st century than they are to millions of children dying from impure water and air? When pressed, environmentalists say words like: "The human species is not imperiled; look at the incredible number of births in the developing world. We must concentrate on protecting species and habitats that are imperiled."
Population growth is the core environmental problem for most of the world. But better environmental health will help slow that growth, not expand it. "The technical literature is unanimous that when you improve basic health, especially child and reproductive health, birth rates go down," Chivian says. "Many environmentalists don't understand this, but it is the essential fact of the issue. If you want species and habitats preserved, protecting human health so that fertility rates decline will accomplish far more than building walls around wildlife preserves."
In poor nations, women become pregnant many times to be confident of having a few children survive till adulthood and provide for the parents' old age. As education, women's rights and childhood survival rates improve, numbers of pregnancies decline. In the 1960's, the typical developing-world woman gave birth to six live children; today, the figure is four. Fertility rates are declining in developing countries that have positive indexes for issues like safe water and progress on the clean-energy slope. Fertility rates remain high mainly in Africa and the Indian subcontinent, where deaths from dirty water and dung smoke are concentrated.
Given the crisis in basic environmental needs among the world's disenfranchised, Western environmentalists and governments would do well to shift their focus from the ecological problems of the developed world. A dollar spent protecting the environment will accomplish 10 times as much in the third world as in the first.
Five years ago, Western environmental groups succeeded in drawing international attention to the loss of tropical rain forests. Since then, deforestation rates have fallen. If Western environmentalists devoted as much energy and concern to human health in the third world, progress might be seen there as well.

A Moral Workout for Big Money

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH; Robert B. Reich is the Secretary of Labor.

 BODY:
CALL it an exercise plan for institutional investors.
The Clinton Administration wants to help pension funds flex their financial muscles. These funds are the stewards of more than $4.8 trillion in workers' money. When they act like canny owners, they lift prospects not just for their many beneficiaries; the whole economy is helped. 
 And the funds' often-large size, plus their long-term perspective as the custodians of retirement money, are inspiring in some of them a new ethic of stewardship. This ethic retains the conventional imperative of financial return yet also casts a wider net in the search for good investments.
The Administration wants to celebrate the success of these pioneers and to promulgate their examples. What follows are some specifics of their approach:
* Watch the workplace. A balance sheet tells investors a great deal about a company's condition -- inventories, accounts payable and receivable, debt level. But it misses much else. Hard-to-measure data about the work force and workplace practices -- the quality and loyalty of employees, investment in training and retraining, and health and safety strategies -- are especially likely to elude standard accounting. Yet these factors can matter enormously -- especially for long-term players like pension funds.
In June, the California Public Employee Retirement System, or Calpers, decided to make workplace practices a criterion for managing investments. The move was based in part on a study by the Gordon Group of financial analysts, who found that, from 1990 to 1994, companies with "high performance" workplace practices outperformed the S.& P. 500 by an average 16 percent each year and beat their industry averages by 7.5 percent. Companies with poor workplace practices, conversely, had substandard financial results. Other studies -- described in a Labor Department guide on the subject -- further establish the link between high-performance workplaces and bottom-line results.
* Get out the vote. In principle, corporations are democracies, but in practice few shareholders bother to vote their shares. Individual investors have another option, of course; they can simply sell their stock when they disagree with managers.
But many pension funds are such major players they cannot unload their holdings without disrupting trading and lowering share prices. In such cases, their best choice is to stick it out -- and this means using the voting power that comes with ownership to keep managers' minds concentrated on sound, long-term strategies.
Like high-performance workplace practices, exercising the corporate vote can help the bottom line. For example, Wilshire Associates tracked 42 companies during five years when Calpers took an active role in their governance. These companies beat the S.& P. 500 by 41 percent -- while in the prior five years the same companies underperformed the S.& P. by 66 percent.
* Seek profit . . . and growth. Pension funds are so big, and their interests so long-run, that success is determined not only by the stocks they hold but by the vitality of the economy itself. Enter "economically targeted investment."
An awkward term, admittedly, but the common-sense truth behind it is that there is rarely just one investment to fit a fund's requirements. For any combination of risk, return and diversification, there will usually be several good candidates. Economically targeted investing means applying to these candidates a second layer of analysis, to pinpoint those that promise investors both attractive returns and broader long-term benefits.
Some examples: The Equitable Company has helped pension funds in Boston and St. Louis reap strong returns through housing investments that also bolster local economies. The Trust Company of the West has plowed $200 million of union pensions into energy infrastructure -- earning a 14 percent return while spurring further growth. And more than 100 Massachusetts pension funds have invested in start-up companies that gave investors average annual returns of 16 percent -- and gave the state 5,000 new jobs.
Unlike "social investing," which subordinates returns to other purposes, economically targeted investing seeks collateral benefits that are in addition to, not instead of, competitive rates of return. Economic targeting in no way excuses subpar returns, but it encourages investments that fortify an economy's foundations, enhancing any company's ability to produce robust profits. So defined, the practice is entirely consistent with fiduciary prudence under Federal pension law, as the Labor Department has said.
Pension funds have the heft and strength to lift the prospects of America's businesses and workers. This Administration's goal is to help them as they hoist.

Workers' Paradise Is Lost, but Its Spas Live On

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZHELEZNODOROZHNY, Russia

 BODY:
On a tiny table not far from the whirlpool baths lies a glass pitcher of sepia-colored liquid labeled Concoction No. 3. Above it, a chart indicates that Concoction No. 3 helps fight "neurotic obsession."
Every afternoon, patients have a glass of their prescribed herbal potion. Then, depending on their ailment, they undergo massage, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, electronic joint massage, eucalyptus inhalation, sauna, hot paraffin wraps and acupuncture and listen to relaxation tapes. 
 Six o'clock is happy hour, when all patients, whether suffering from hypertension, rheumatism or varicose veins, gather in the solarium to sip oxygen cocktails -- a foamy mixture of herbal tea, egg whites, syrup and pumped-in oxygen.
It is not a new age spa in California, but the Metallurg Sanitarium-Prophylaxis center, a sprawling rest and preventive medicine center just outside Moscow for the 7,000 workers of the Hammer and Sickle factory, a large state-owned steel factory.
Nothing has changed much at the sanitarium since it was opened in 1946. The battered, aging equipment, which includes ultraviolet lamps, inhalation cones, a low-pressure chamber and a quartz ray machine, has an old-fashioned futuristic look, like Flash Gordon. Among the flower beds, a copper statue of Lenin points accusingly at the future.
The ideological system that spawned hundreds of similar workers' health spas throughout the country has collapsed. And so has the economy that could afford free 24-day spa vacations for factory workers.
But even those state-owned enterprises that are slouching toward bankruptcy are reluctant to close down places that have become an inalienable right in Russia. Like other such centers, the Metallurg, seven miles beyond Moscow's city limits, is reluctantly adapting itself to a market economy by taking in some paying customers. At heart, it is a quintessential Soviet institution clinging to the past.
Grigory M. Derilo, 51, the chief doctor, defiantly keeps a framed photograph of Lenin across from his desk and says he does not welcome opening his sanctuary to some tourists and business travelers.
"Times are tough," Dr. Derilo said with a shrug. "We are only on the brink of survival." Wearily he added, "I'm afraid I'm going to have to make it more of a commercial structure -- open it even to mafia people."
These sorts of workers' health centers were first proposed in 1902 by a Russian doctor, S. I. Glikman, and adopted in the 1920's by the Bolsheviks as a centerpiece of the workers' paradise. The average stay is 24 days. Depending on their illnesses, workers are taken by bus to prophylaxis centers after work, where they spend the night, and then are sent back to work -- a way of dispensing treatment without losing productivity. Sicker workers check into similar places called sanitariums for round-the-clock rest and treatment.
There were once 350 sanitariums and prophylaxis centers in the Moscow region, and now there are only 100. The Metallurg center, which has 200 beds, operates as both.
Factory workers pay only $10 for a 24-day stay, with the factory, trade unions and the Government picking up the rest. Outsiders pay $200. But Dr. Derilo has neither the resources nor the inclination to pamper more well-to-do clients. The grounds are vast and well tended, but carpets are worn, beds are narrow, linoleum is scuffed, tiles are broken, pipes are rusty and the kitchen serves Russian soups, not spa cuisine.
Music is piped in over the loudspeaker, but on weekends waltzes and polkas are performed by a visiting three-member military band. Most patients view the center, which has orchards, vegetable gardens, a small lake and a forest, not just as a health clinic but also as an all-expenses-paid vacation.
"Some people are afraid we could lose all this," said Nina Rybina, 56, who, in track suit and sneakers, was coming in from a brisk walk in the woods with two friends. "But they can't take it away -- it's a necessity."
Mrs. Rybina has worked as a quality control inspector for 39 years, gets paid $200 a month and takes the cure twice a year to treat her aching joints. She said she enjoyed the massage, the clean air and the food. Her only complaint is that there are not enough male patients to go around at the Saturday night dances.
The Metallurg center has not yet become infected with the abstemious spirit that rules American health spas. Above the gymnasium, there is a billiard room, a disco and a bar with a professional bartender on duty every night after 6 P.M. Smoking is frowned on, but not much.
Some treatments, which include leeches, cupping and homeopathic remedies, are alarmingly old-fangled. And though Russian doctors insist that sanitarium stays are good for virtually all ailments, prevent illness and save lives, it is hard to make a strong case in a country where the average life expectancy for men recently dropped to 60.
The centers, like factory sports arenas, day-care centers, seaside vacation resorts, subsidized housing and a professional soccer team, are the social safety net that failing industries still provide -- and that the Government cannot afford to duplicate.
Trade unions and government social services used to share the cost of such places. Because trade unions are increasingly unable to come up with their shares, the management of companies like Hammer and Sickle tries to make up the difference. The factory director, Nikolai Y. Izvekov, said it cost the factory nearly a $1 million to operate the center last year.
"Anything could happen," Mr. Izvekov said, "but I just can't imagine ever closing it down."

HEADLINE: California Vietnamese Off to Hanoi

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Calif., Sept. 8

 BODY:
It took him eight tries and cost him nearly two years in prison, but a decade ago Philip Nguyen succeeded in fleeing Vietnam with his wife and children, though with little else.
This month, to the outrage of some fellow refugees here in the community known as Little Saigon, he will return as a member of a delegation from the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Westminster to establish business links with the Communist leaders in Hanoi. 
 "I am going as a businessman," said Mr. Nguyen, who is 49 and is now a partner in a company that manufactures water-filtration systems. "But also I would like it if my relatives in Vietnam, if 73 million citizens there, can enjoy the same standard of living I enjoy here."
The trip adds an official stamp to the increasing flow of Vietnamese-American entrepreneurs back to their homeland since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo earlier this year. For the refugees who live here, it is emblematic of a certain normalization, of the ascendancy of economics over politics.
 
A Black Market Economy
 And as the economy of Little Saigon has begun to sag in recent months, the people here find themselves looking back to the country they fled for business gains.
The lifting of the embargo has hurt the busy underground economy that helped support Little Saigon, where about 60,000 Vietnamese-Americans cluster in a bustling enclave 30 miles south of Los Angeles. Many of the 1,500 businesses in the community thrived on the black-market transfer of dollars and goods to Vietnam, mostly through third countries like Thailand and Taiwan.
Business boomed with sales of everything from pharmaceutical products to computers, shipped to Vietnam by various routes. Even with much of its economy underground, Little Saigon was paying $1 million a year in taxes to Westminster, said Dr. Co Pham, the president of the Chamber of Commerce and the leader of this month's delegation to Vietnam.
But now, he said, many of its pristine malls and shopping centers do little business. Turnover is high as shops open, stand nearly empty for a few months, then close down, not only because of the collapse of the underground market but also because of the general economic malaise.
 
Looking for Outlets
 So the community that fled Vietnam in fear and desperation is turning its eyes back toward "big Saigon," hoping to find new business outlets and new investors.
"We want Little Saigon to be the Hong Kong of Vietnam in the future," said Dr. Co, a gynecologist who heads the thriving Bolsa Medical Center here.
The Vietnamese community here can be the middleman for exports, travel and banking as well as the recipient of investment by a growing wealthy class of Vietnamese officials, he said.
Hien Phan, the executive director of the chamber and another member of the delegation, said, "People will get wealthier and ideologies will vanish once they have a taste of money."
But the passions of the 20 years of fighting have been slow to die.
Plans for the trip have fired the opposition of the anti-Communist right wing in the fractured overseas Vietnamese community, where until recently people were afraid to let it be known that they were going home for a visit. In past years, a newspaper editor was killed for advocating contacts with the Hanoi Government, and a travel agency that organized visits was firebombed.
Even today, one local Vietnamese politician finds it imprudent to have anything to say publicly on the issue. "If I speak truly from my heart then I will anger some group or another," he said. "But I believe strongly -- don't quote me -- that this trip is a positive thing."
Every day except Sunday, a half dozen demonstrators carrying the yellow-and-red flag of South Vietnam sit outside Dr. Co's newly opened medical center with its California-style pink-stucco walls and Vietnamese-style curved red-tile roof.
Large yellow banners stretched between the trees read, "To foster Communism for dollars is a crime against humanity." Some patients entering his clinic have been harassed, Dr. Co said, and some have stopped coming.
"These guys keep annoying me," Dr. Co said, sitting inside his air-conditioned office as assistants ushered patients down the carpeted hallway. "They threaten my life all the time. I'm tired of them."
An organizer of the protests, Diem Do, said: "Without foreign money, without foreign capital, without financial resources, the chances are they will collapse much sooner."
But the political byplay is only a sideshow to the new economic imperatives of the overseas Vietnamese community, a vestige of a long-dead war, said Yen Do, editor of the country's largest Vietnamese-language newspaper, Nguoi Viet Daily News.
"Politics is just a sport here," Mr. Yen said. "People talk politics but they don't believe what they say. The true motivations around here are all business. Even the people who are against Dr. Co, a lot of them are doctors who are afraid he and his people will take over the H.M.O. here. That's not politics. It's purely business."
 
Seeking Broader Horizons
 For Mr. Nguyen, the Chamber of Commerce delegation is smart business. His company, Environmental Group Products International, with $200 million in annual sales, already has a customer in Vietnam. But he said Government contacts open the possibility of much broader horizons in a mostly centralized economy.
The 10-day trip in late September will visit both Ho Chi Minh City -- the former Saigon -- and the capital, Hanoi, where Dr. Co has scheduled meetings with the four top members of the Vietnamese Government. Even if only one or two of those top-level meetings actually take place, he said, an important connection will have been made.
Connections are everything, Mr. Nguyen said. Water quality is very poor in Vietnam, with its antiquated plumbing systems, he said. "If we can make the Government aware of the problem, it can pass an ordinance, new rules and regulations, so that hotels and restaurants would need to purify their water."
The prospects for Environmental Group Products International would be almost limitless.

HEADLINE: Putting Sex In Its Place

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
For decades, sex-oriented entertainment in New York City was largely confined to the sleazier stretches of Times Square. Now such businesses can be found everywhere from the Adult Love Boutique on Queens Boulevard to the All Star Harmony Club on West 22d Street in Chelsea.
The industry has grown in response to the widespread home use of video recorders and the increasing popularity of topless bars among an affluent male clientele. And as it has spread throughout New York City, particularly into Queens and middle-class neighborhoods in Manhattan, it has produced a widespread backlash among outraged residents of several communities. 
 Those are the economic and political forces that led Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to propose restricting X-rated businesses to a few fringe areas, today consisting mostly of warehouses and industrial buildings. The proposal, announced on Saturday, would prohibit those establishments within 500 feet of residences, churches, schools or one another.
 
'Behind the Rest of the Country'
 In reacting to the transformation of the commercial sex industry, New York is joining dozens of other cities that have placed strict limits on the highly profitable business of adult entertainment.
"New York is way behind the rest of the country," said Joseph B. Rose, the head of the Department of City Planning, which produced an 85-page study of the industry to back up the proposal. "This is a quality-of-life issue that is of real concern in communities across the city."
For New York City, several other factors also account for the spread of sex-related businesses.
In recent years, city and state officials shut down dozens of sex-oriented business on and around West 42d Street in midtown Manhattan to make way for the redevelopment of Times Square. That put added pressure on entrepreneurs in the adult entertainment industry to find other locations. At the same time, the recession of the late 1980's and early 90's drove hundreds of storefront retailers out of business in commercial areas around the city, causing some landlords desperate for cash to rent to businesses they previously shunned.
"This is partly a result of what happens when we clean up midtown Manhattan," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "Pornography has moved from the central business district to the neighborhoods."
From the late 1970's, the number of X-rated businesses in the Times Square area fell from an all-time high of about 140 to a low of 36 before rising recently to 43 establishments, according to the Times Square Business Improvement District. But over the last decade, sex-oriented establishments have become much more numerous and widespread, the City Planning Department found, growing by 35 percent -- from 131 locations in 1984, confined mostly to mid-Manhattan, to 177 in December 1993. Nearly all the increase was in Queens and sections of Manhattan outside the Times Square area.
Today, topless bars alone generate $50 million a year in revenue in New York City, according to estimates cited in the Planning Department study.
In seeking to restrict sex-oriented business, city officials say they recognize that courts have long held that sexually explicit videos, books and dancing -- as long as they do not violate obscenity statutes -- are forms of free speech protected under the First Amendment. But judges have allowed cities to limit the operations of adult businesses through zoning regulations if they can demonstrate harmful "secondary impacts" from their presence.
The evidence of harmful side effects is mixed, the City Planning Department study found. In six areas surveyed, only two -- along the Avenue of the Americas in Chelsea and on Queens Boulevard in Woodside -- showed sharply higher crime rates around adult entertainment establishments than in similar blocks without them. In one area, crime was lower and the other three were relatively unaffected.
While real-estate brokers said that property values were likely to be depressed close to such establishments, local business owners were split and the study found that the effect on assessed values was inconclusive.
Nonetheless, the new proposal is likely to find widespread support in the City Council, where 48 of the 51 Council members have signed on as sponsors of two pieces of similar legislation to restrict adult businesses. Some issues remain to be settled, including how to define those businesses.
But despite objections from civil libertarians, the courts -- including the New York State Supreme Court when it accepted limits imposed by the town of Islip, L.I. -- have generally allowed municipalities to draw on evidence from other cities as well in justifying controls over the location of X-rated entertainment.
"We are just trying to regulate the time, place and manner of this stuff," said Councilman Charles Millard of Manhattan, an East Side Republican who is the sponsor of legislation to restrict X-rated video stores. "The goal is not to keep pornography out of the city. The goal is keep the negative effects out of our neighborhoods."
 
Changing Political Climate
 Meanwhile, the political climate in New York City has changed in ways that make such restrictions more likely to be accepted. In the late 1970's, similar legislation to limit adult entertainment was blocked by intense opposition from liberals and residents of neighborhoods where the shops would have still been allowed.
But now the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, an outspoken liberal, supports legislation that while less restrictive would still limit the placement of adult businesses and the signs they use. Attacks on pornography by feminists have also played a role in making such restrictions more acceptable -- and the generation that came of age in the freewheeling 1960's now has a different perspective.
"Even hip middle-class liberals in Chelsea don't want their kids walking by several X-rated shops on their way to school," said Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union and a prominent conservative on social issues.
Councilman Millard agreed. "Twenty years ago, it would have been considered prudish to try to control the pornography business," he said. "That's no longer true."

The Economy
For the first time in three years, fall is not bringing strong growth in the economy. It is a decisive sign, many economists, Government officials and business executives say, that the strongest days of the recovery from the recession may be in the past. That recognition has renewed the debate over how much economic growth is possible without bringing on a damaging level of inflation. [Page A1.] 
 An obscure provision of the Clinton Administration's interstate banking bill would effectively prevent Federal regulators from pursuing most negligence cases against the officers, directors, lawyers and accountants of failed savings and loan institutions. As a result, the banking bill, the Administration's biggest piece of financial legislation, faces a new, last-minute threat. [D1.]
Builders in Dallas are again tearing down homes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to raise homes worth millions, and the area's economy is zooming ahead of the nation's. But the best reading on regional giddiness may be the Cattle Baron's Ball, an event that defies caricature. [D5.]

The Media Business
While Time Warner and General Electric continued to hold what several executives described as mostly exploratory negotiations involving Time Warner's interest in NBC, other media companies scrambled last week to get positions of their own. One senior executive called it "the biggest game of musical chairs ever to hit this business." [D6.]

HEADLINE: Mexico's Trading Allies Play Financial Bodyguard

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Even though Mexico's most important trading partners expressed confidence in the country's ability to survive peacefully any result of last month's presidential election, they quietly put together a $6 billion plan to back the peso just in case there was trouble.
United States Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has disclosed, and Mexican finance officials have confirmed, that in the weeks leading up to the Aug. 21 election a plan was secretly put together for several European central banks and Japan to extend a $6 billion line of credit to Mexico. The money was available to help Mexico in case there was a run on the peso after a governing-party loss or, as Mr. Bentsen said, "in case violence broke out." 
 Disclosure of the election backup plan is sure to cause a political controversy, just as occurred after some previous plans were disclosed in news reports.
The $6 billion credit line from the Europeans and Japanese was in addition to $6 billion made available to Mexico by the United States in March in the uncertain hours after the assassination of the ruling party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. Thus, in all, the Mexicans had $12 billion in backup to withstand any post-election difficulties.
Under both agreements, the Mexican Central Bank would lend pesos to the foreign banks in exchange for hard currencies. The Mexicans then would be able to use the dollars, franks, marks and yen to augment their own foreign reserves in staving off panic selling.
"We obviously put together the fund and got several other countries to join in," Mr. Bentsen said during an interview here last week. He had traveled to Mexico to meet with the winner of the Aug. 21 election, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, and other important Mexican officials.
Playing financial bodyguard to Mexico is something the United States has done at least three times in the last year, including the elections. The support that came after the assassination of Mr. Colosio was the only time United States officials openly discussed the contingency plans.
In fact, last fall Mexican officials often denied there was any contingency plan prepared in case the North American Free Trade Agreement was not approved in the United States Congress. However, it was later learned that two weeks before the crucial Congressional vote last November, United States Treasury officials helped arrange what in total was a $12 billion line of credit to support the peso in case the trade plan was defeated.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had made the pact a crucial element of his plan for economic recovery and modernization. The failure to get it passed in 1993 would have seriously hurt the Mexican stock exchange and caused a flight of capital, analysts believed.
The trade-accord contingency plan involved money from two sources: the United States put up $6 billion and a group of European central banks put up an additional $6 billion.
The arrangement was kept quiet, and after the accord passed in Congress in November, the deal was essentially shelved, although the legal papers were preserved.
Those documents formed the basis of a round of negotiations that began within hours of the Colosio assassination in Tijuana on March 23. Because Mr. Colosio had been heavily favored to become the next president, the situation was considered threatening and the response, officials said at the time, had to be immediate.
Mr. Bentsen and Mexico's Finance Minister, Pedro Aspe, signed the arrangements for the money swap within hours and quickly put the $6 billion United States side of the deal back into action. But because of complications from the time differences and distances involved, the European half was not enacted.
Mexican officials said that the same arrangement with the Europeans was essentially what was revived this summer. One high-ranking Mexican finance official, who did not want to be identified because he said the European banks were not eager to have information about the deal exposed, said the terms of the pre-election contingency plan were similar to what had been struck last fall before the vote on the trade accord.
He said the banks involved were the central banks of the leading industrialized European nations, plus Spain and Japan. The deal was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements.
The European offer will continue for an undisclosed period of time, the Mexican official said. The earlier credit line for the trade-accord vote expired after two months.
In the weeks leading up to the Mexican election, President Clinton; the United States Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, and other officials said openly that they believed the Mexican elections would be fair and peaceful. But at the same time, Treasury officials were completing the negotiations for the contingency plan, just in case.
The earlier interventions by the United States were criticized by some Mexicans, who felt the support amounted to a tacit endorsement by the United States of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has been in power for 65 years.
Mr. Bentsen defended the decisions to stand by Mexico in times of crisis, or expected crisis.
"None of them were used," he said of the three plans. "And at present, I don't see the need for this one."

HEADLINE: Big D's Unofficial Prosperity Index

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Builders here are once again tearing down homes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to raise homes worth millions, and the area's economy is zooming ahead of the nation's. But the best read on Dallas giddiness might well be the Cattle Baron's Ball Index of Philanthropic Overachievement.
The ball, which was held on Saturday night, appears to have broken the record $800,000 raised by the 1985 Cattle Baron's Ball, all for the American Cancer Society. If that result reflects a stronger local economy it also speaks to the attractions of a setting that exemplifies the turnaround: the Circle T ranch, handed over by a bankrupt Nelson Bunker Hunt to his creditors and bought last year for $20 million by Ross Perot Jr. 
 Real estate, which led Dallas and its banks, savings and loans and charity balls into trouble in the late 1980's, is leading the way back. But not with the same swagger. Banks used to lend the full amount of a real estate project, or even more. Now, under owners from chillier places like Ohio and New York, banks want the developers to kick in at least 25 percent of the money themselves.
 
Host's Father Is Big Ross
 Mr. Perot, 35, heads a newer generation of Dallas developers who are more cautious, or at least more cautious sounding. Physically, Mr. Perot loomed larger than his father at the ball, but in Dallas, it is still the elder Perot who is known as Big Ross.
At the ranch house, the younger Mr. Perot was the host of a pre-party party for the 300 best-connected or highest-donating among the 2,350 ball guests. He was all set in a side room with aerial maps showing his plans for the 2,000-acre ranch and the total of about 23,000 acres that he owns in the Dallas and Fort Worth area.
He played host at the Cattle Baron's Ball because it was a good cause. "Also, it's a good marketing event," he said. "For the Asians," he continued, referring to groups from Singapore and Japan nearby, "it's everything they envision Texas to be."
The ball is exclusive in the Dallas sense that anyone with a $350 ticket and a pair of hand-made Lucchese boots can go. It defies caricature, although the television series "Dallas" tried.
Angie Young, the ball chairwoman, greeted visitors in front of the ranch house in a suede suit with sequins and embroidered covered wagons, cacti and so forth ("This is a Manuel from Nashville," she said. "It's artful country.") Other women were more intent on crowding as many rhinestones and fringes as possible onto the briefest possible leather dresses with the lowest possible necklines.
 
Madison Avenue Gone West
 Setup crews turned a patch of land 40 minutes from downtown into the spot where the Western frontier meets Madison Avenue by way of Las Vegas. The shingled facades along the party site's main drag had signs that boasted the importance of corporate sponsors, with fewer individuals able or willing to write a big check. There were the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan/Aetna Health Plans country bank and the Wild West Outfitters and Justin Boot Company/ Polo Ralph Lauren Saloon.
But Texas business is still often personal. Newspapers could best serve their readers by sending their society columnists to the shareholders meetings and the financial and political writers to the society balls. Annette Strauss, sister-in-law of Robert, the former Democratic Party Chairman, used some of the skills she developed in raising money for universities and medical causes to win two campaigns to be Dallas's Mayor.
Politics, business and charity remained in comfortable proximity at the Cattle Baron's Ball. At least two members of Congress were seated at the younger Mr. Perot's table, as well as Robert H. Dedman Sr., founder of the Club Corporation of America.
Not that everyone in Dallas is jolly. About one-third of the office buildings downtown are still empty, and several have been abandoned.
 
'It's a Boom'
 But property seized from failed savings and loans is nearly sold off, and real estate investment trusts are fueling a rebound in prices and development. "It's a boom compared with where we were two years ago,' said Ray Perryman, an economist at Southern Methodist University, "but it's not the sort of rank speculation we had in the early 80's."
Maybe not, but developers are building several homes on speculation, gambling on finding buyers for $3 million and up. A $4.5 million house in North Dallas, replacing a mere $700,000 hovel, has a movie theater with commercial-grade sound and more than half an acre -- inside.
At Saturday's ball, however, gambling, even for a good cause, was out of fashion. Craps tables stood vacant much of the evening.
But the chance to golf with a celebrity like Kenny Rogers the day before drew many takers. At $5,000 a foursome, the Cattle Baron's Golf Classic, started this year by a neighboring developer, Jeff Beck, raised $100,000.
The younger Mr. Perot, even with the party swirling around him, quietly acknowledged that what happened to Mr. Hunt a few years ago, part of his possessions auctioned at this very ranch house, should serve as a warning for the present owner to be patient.
Better to have his 500 head of cattle graze for several more years. Or graze undisturbed for several more years. As Mr. Perot said of his development plans, "I doubt very seriously we're going to make this cycle."
A few minutes later, his father was asked how long the view of rolling green hills might remain unchanged at this property. "Well,' he said of his son, "he's marketing it right now."

HEADLINE: Brazil Cuts Its Tariffs on Many Goods

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Tariffs protecting the Brazilian economy, Latin America's largest, are to be slashed by almost one-third on Monday.
Moving to bolster the nation's fight against inflation, Finance Minister Ciro Gomes announced on Saturday that Brazil's median tariff, covering 13,000 types of goods, would drop to 14 percent from 20 percent. Only cars, computers and factory machinery would be excluded. 
 With $42 billion in foreign exchange reserves and a healthy trade surplus shaping up for 1994, officials believe that Brazil's economy will become more competitive on prices with an injection of imports. Even before the tariff cut, United States officials had predicted that exports to Brazil would jump by 25 percent this year.
Over all, United States exports to Latin America are growing at three times the rate of exports to the rest of the world. Within five years, trade analysts predict, the United States will trade more with Latin America than with Western Europe.
Brazil's tariff cut comes as South American nations are making strides to convert the continent into a free-trade zone.
Last month, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay formally agreed on terms for a regional customs union. That union -- the Southern Cone Common Market, known in Portuguese by the shorthand of Mercosul -- will on Jan. 1 adopt common tariffs as well as duty-free trade for 85 percent of the goods sold among its members. With 200 million people, the combined market has a gross regional product of $800 billion and about two-thirds of South America's economic activity.
 
Latin Leaders Meet
 On Friday, Chilean diplomats started negotiating a free-trade association with the group. "By the end of this year, negotiations will be concluded," said a joint statement after the talks, which took place as part of a meeting here of the heads of state of Latin America's 14 largest nations.
Two weeks from now, representatives of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela are to meet in Uruguay for five days of talks with the Southern Cone group about terms and schedules for free-trade association.
"We are inviting all these countries to negotiate accords with Mercosul," said Jose Artur Denot Medeiros, a Brazilian diplomat in charge of economic integration. "This is a major step toward the creation of the South American Free Trade Area."
The Latin American heads of state, at the end of their two days of meetings, expressed optimism about the creation of a duty-free trade zone in South America.
There have been other measures of progress between individual nations. The presidents of Bolivia and Mexico on Saturday signed a treaty here to make 80 percent of their trade duty-free by the end of this year. On Monday, Chile is to start talks to establish a free-trade treaty with Peru. Next month, Chile and Ecuador are to sign a trade treaty.
With the United States watching from the sidelines, Jacques Delors, president of the European Union, is to come to Brasilia on Sept. 22 to explore ways of creating a preferential trade association between Western Europe and the Southern Cone market.
Trade within this union has doubled since 1991, reaching $10 billion last year. Today, company executives increasingly think regionally.
 
Beer for a Continent?
 For instance, Brahma S.A., Brazil's largest brewer, determined to make its beer Latin America's favorite, this year bought large breweries in Argentina and Venezuela.
Next month, 16 Latin airlines are to join forces to market Latin Pass, a frequent-flier program for the region.
With border wars fast fading memories, nations are promoting physical integration. Last week, Paraguay and Brazil put out for bids a project for the construction of a second bridge over the Parana River. It is expected to cost about $40 million.
Last month, the United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation said it would provide Tenneco with $200 million in financing and $200 million in insurance for the construction next year of a gas pipeline between Argentina and Chile.
Enron is to take part in a $2 billion project to build a 1,400-mile gas line from eastern Bolivia to Sao Paulo. With construction due to start next year, the pipeline is to provide Brazil with eight million cubic meters of gas by 1997.
In another project indicating greater economic integration, Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia is to help build a pipeline between Bolivia and Chile, providing six million cubic meters of gas a day to northern Chile.
Opportunities for construction companies from the United States are rising as South American countries abolish rules favoring national companies and place development projects in private hands.
Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, said in an interview on Saturday that "waterways, highways, gas lines and railroads are a great priority."
"We have reserved 5 percent of our portfolio for private projects without state guarantees," he said. "We think that the presence of an international organization will be a great catalyst for private infrastructure construction."

HEADLINE: Republican Hopefuls Fishing for Votes

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 11

 BODY:
John Rowland carried Fairfield County in nearly winning a three-way race for governor in 1990, and today he returned to the county in hopes of reclaiming it in Tuesday's primary for the Republican nomination against his challenger, Secretary of State Pauline R. Kezer.
"This is our time," Mr. Rowland, a former Congressman from Waterbury, told Greenwich Republicans as they ate lobster and steak at the 63d annual Cos Cob Republican Club clambake. "After 24 years, this is our time for victory. Let's not spoil the opportunity." 
 Mr. Rowland, who held a 52-percentage-point advantage over Mrs. Kezer in a poll published today by The Hartford Courant, was urging Republicans to unite for the general election by falling in behind him in the primary. But even here in Greenwich, Connecticut's mother lode of Republican votes and campaign contributions, Mrs. Kezer would not concede an inch.
The center of Connecticut, she told the audience, is not Fairfield County, even though it has 30 percent of the state's Republicans. The center, she said, is the Hartford region, her political base and that of the state's last Republican Governor, Thomas G. Meskill, elected in 1970.
And Mr. Rowland, she said, does not represent the center of Connecticut politics, but "the radical right." At stake, she said, "is whether we win in November, and you have to go with the person who captures the hearts and minds of the Connecticut people." She added, "You can't do it with the right wing."
From the outset, Mrs. Kezer, a former state legislator from Plainville, has tried to cast the primary as a test of Republican philosophy. She said Mr. Rowland and other conservatives who captured the party leadership after the 1988 Senate defeat of Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a liberal, have doomed the party to fail in this moderate state.
But as a challenger who barely qualified for the primary at the party's convention in July, and who has raised less money than any other candidate for governor, Mrs. Kezer, in Greenwich at least, appeared to have problems in selling her argument that she had the best chance of being elected.
The Republican with the name recognition and campaign financing needed to win in November is Mr. Rowland, many partygoers said today, even as they praised Mrs. Kezer for her campaign and acknowledged concerns about some of Mr. Rowland's positions.
He has been the clear leader so far in polls matching him against Eunice S. Groark, running on A Connecticut Party's line to succeed Mr. Weicker, who won in 1990, and against the two Democrats competing in a primary, State Senator John B. Larson and State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr. Governor Weicker is not seeking re-election.
"The response I get from a lot of Republicans," Mr. Rowland said, "is, 'We're not going to let anything ruin this chance.' "
As a moderate Republican, in fact, Mrs. Kezer may be hurt in Tuesday's primary by Mr. Weicker's founding of A Connecticut Party. An unknown number of Republicans who might well have supported her are supporting Mrs. Groark instead and are sitting out the primary.
"If John has a problem here, it's from Eunice Groark, not Pauline," said State Representative Janet K. Lockton of Greenwich.
 
Party Hurts Some Friends
 By taking a place near the center of Connecticut's political spectrum, A Connecticut Party tends to prosper at the expense of those most in agreement with it philosophically, moderate and liberal Republicans in a primary, and the core of the Democratic Party in general elections.
If Mr. Rowland wins the primary, his ideological challenge in November will come from Tom Scott, a former State Senator and opponent of the state's new income tax, who is running as an independent pledged to repeal the tax.
Mr. Scott could cause trouble for Mr. Rowland by pressing him on his promise to eliminate the $2.8 billion tax, Mrs. Lockton said. While she supports Mr. Rowland, she agrees with Mrs. Kezer's argument that the tax is simply too big a source of revenue to eliminate. Mrs. Kezer has promised to cut the income-tax rate by 35 percent.
"We can't do away with the income tax," Mrs. Lockton said. "It's too much money."
 
Questions on Abortion
 Mrs. Lockton said many Republicans would also be watching Mr. Rowland carefully on the abortion issue. In 1990 he switched abruptly from opposing abortion to supporting a woman's right to choose, and at one time this summer he appeared to waver on his pledge to leave alone the state's abortion law.
"Republicans in Greenwich are 100 percent for choice," Mrs. Lockton said. "It's an issue that concerns me, and it's an issue that would concern a lot of Republicans. I don't want waffling on it."
Mr. Rowland, however, is focusing on his favorite themes, creating jobs, fighting crime, improving schools and remaking the welfare system. He says he has spent years listening to Connecticut residents, and he knows what they want after a recession that has shaken their confidence in the future.
 
'Kind of Scary'
 "I look at Larson's commercials and Curry's commercials and it's kind of scary; it's almost word for word what I'm saying," Mr. Rowland said. "We're arguing about whether it's a 10 percent or a 25 percent tax cut.
"The point is, those guys have been there for the last dozen years, so they've had a chance to make these changes. My rebuttal is going to be simple: 'John Larson, you've been there as leader for eight years, so why now?' "
Mrs. Kezer said she was still confident about the primary despite The Courant poll, which showed Mr. Rowland with the support of 70 percent of Republicans who said they planned to vote; she had only 18 percent. The poll, conducted by the Institute for Social Inquiry at the University of Connecticut, surveyed 337 Republicans last week and had a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
In the last week, Mrs. Kezer said, she had been endorsed by The Courant, the state's largest newspaper, which said Mr. Rowland "retains the hard edge of Ronald Reagan's 1980's Republicanism." And the candidacy of Mr. Scott, she said, now threatened Mr. Rowland's own base in November.
Primaries are difficult to predict because as few as 20 percent of all Republicans vote in them.
Republicans have two other primary contests on Tuesday, when polls will be open from 6 A.M. to 8 P.M. Although in November each party's candidates for governor and lieutenant governor will appear in a single box, on Tuesday Republicans can choose between Jodi M. Rell, a State Representative from Brookfield who is Mr. Rowland's running mate, and Joseph J. Rucci Jr., a lawyer from New Canaan who is Mrs. Kezer's.
In addition, Republicans are conducting a primary to decide their nominee for the United States Senate. Dr. Gerald Labriola, a former candidate for governor and a retired pediatrician, is the convention-endorsed candidate. Dr. Joseph Bentivegna, an eye surgeon from Rocky Hill, is the challenger.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS FROM PEAK, RENEWING DEBATE

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For the first time in three years, fall is not bringing a powerful burst of growth for the American economy. It is a decisive sign, many economists, Government officials and business executives say, that the strongest days of the recovery from the 1991 recession may be in the past.
"No one is expecting -- not the Federal Reserve, nor the Administration nor the forecasters -- for the economy to return to the peak growth rate that was reached in recent months," said Alan S. Blinder, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and, until June, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 That recognition has renewed the perennial debate over how much economic growth is possible without bringing on damaging inflation. One camp says the robust expansion could not be safely sustained without driving up prices so much that the purchasing power of people's savings would deteriorate. The other camp argues that the recovery is being cut short way before damaging inflation might occur -- and before the recovery could raise wages and living standards.
The debate will almost certainly intensify in coming days as the Federal Reserve considers at its next policy-making meetings, later this month and in November, whether to raise interest rates yet again to slow economic growth, and with it inflation.
The Blue Chip Economic Indicators' September survey of 50 prominent forecasters, released over the weekend, endorsed Mr. Blinder's assessment. The forecasters have become more pessimistic about growth in each of the last three months and now estimate that the economy is growing -- expanding its production of goods and services -- at a 2.2 percent annual rate. That is well below the peak of 4 percent that lasted for a year, until early summer. This year, unlike last, the burst of growth that started in the fall did not disappear in the winter and spring months.
If 4 percent growth is the high mark of this ninth recovery since World War II, it will be the weakest -- too weak to make wages rise faster than inflation, Government data suggest.
During most recoveries, the wage of the typical American worker gained ground on inflation. But this time the typical wage, including that of the college educated, has lost ground. Even though last winter's burst of growth helped to create more than 4.5 million jobs, it has not been enough to halt the wage deterioration.
"My impression from my talks with executives is that the bloom has come off of the economic recovery," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, whose companies have been a pillar of the recovery. "The reports I'm getting in the last week or two are that sales and production are slowing down a bit across manufacturing."
Weaknesses in housing and in retail sales have also become apparent, and stockpiles of unsold goods have built up. Yet important sectors of the economy remain strong. Car and truck production, for example, is robust. So are steel and paper and computers and computer chips and machinery. And while Americans might be spending less, Europeans and Japanese are spending more on imported American goods as their economies recover.
These strengths reinforce fears of rising inflation among those who believe slower growth is safer, notably the Federal Reserve. Indeed, the slowdown was fostered by the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates five times since early February. As higher rates discourage borrowers in an economy that depends on credit, demand weakens for a new car or a lawyer's services or a vacation or thousands of other goods and services and it becomes harder to raise prices.
 
Bond Market's Role
 The bond market, composed of millions of lenders, has also played a big role in slowing the economy, pushing up interest rates even more forcefully than the Federal Reserve has. In Friday's bond trading, these lenders asked, in effect, for another increase in interest rates, after the Labor Department reported that factory prices rose sixth-tenths of 1 percent in August.
"The policies are in place to slow down the economy," said Lawrence J. Meyer, an economic consultant in St. Louis. "We just don't know if we have the rates high enough yet to do the job."
This determination to keep the economy moving downward for a while has brought angry public criticism from business leaders who had remained silent until the Federal Reserve announced its fifth increase in interest rates, in mid-August. "One more rate increase by the Federal Reserve will drive the economy into the ditch, bringing on a recession," Mr. Jasinowski of the manufacturers' group said.
The Federal Reserve's stated goal is to engineer a slowdown without a recession. Its view, shared by the bond market and many economists, is that inflation, now less than 3 percent annually, would spike up if the economy were to continue growing at last winter's strong pace. In this view, the nation lacks enough skilled workers, factories, equipment and materials to meet such demand, and shortages would drive up prices beyond what people could afford. The Fed may then have to provoke a recession to bring down the inflation rate.
"Business expansions get mature and we run out of capacity and this expansion is no exception," said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "The Fed always wants to slow growth before the inflation comes, but it is not an exact science."
 
Global Business New Factor
 The Federal Reserve's method of dealing with a growing economy grew out of policies and practices developed in the early postwar decades, when the American economy was more self-contained. Now global competition and changing business practices give the nation more leeway for economic growth without inflation, Mr. Jasinowski and other opponents of the Fed approach argue.
The Clinton Administration neither challenges nor endorses the Federal Reserve's view of the economy's capacity limit, which the Fed says permits economic growth of only 2.5 percent a year without rising inflation. "There is still quite a bit of uncertainty about how fast the economy can grow," said Robert Wescott, chief economist at the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "That is an active area of research at the council right now."
Nothing illustrates the changing nature of capacity more vividly than the auto industry. Strong demand has kept sales in 9 of the last 10 months at an annual rate of 15 million cars and trucks, or more. But the industry's "capacity" to assemble vehicles is only 14 million at the plants within the United States of General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and the major foreign companies operating in this country.
The auto industry, however, does not think of capacity as limited to plants within the United States. Its concept is North American capacity, which includes plants in Canada and Mexico. These assemble an additional 4.5 million cars for American buyers, and the total of 18.5 million is more than enough to meet even record demand -- and going up.
Ford, for example, has increased annual assembly capacity in North America by 300,000 units in the last year through such things as line speed changes, more shifts, more automation and some new plant space, said Joel Pitcoff, Ford's manager of research and analysis. "To suggest that the auto industry is stymied on capacity is certainly an exaggeration," he said.
 
Capacity Called Criterion
 Many economists, however, hold to a view that capacity within the United States must be the criterion, because imports, including those from Mexico and Canada, can run up the nation's trade deficit, which in turn helps to weaken the dollar. And a weaker dollar eventually means higher prices for imported goods, not only cars but all imports. That prospect upsets the bond market, encouraging these lenders to raise interest rates.
"The relationship between pricing and capacity locks us into the same pattern as in the past" when the global economy was less of a factor, said Will Brown, chief economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
Still, car prices have gone up, and dealers have found themselves without enough of some models to satisfy the demand. But here, too, the dynamic is different from the past.
Government data cite recent increases in vehicle prices as an important contributor to a rising inflation rate. The Big Three auto makers, however, have raised sticker prices by less than 3 percent in the last year. But they did find that they could sell vehicles this summer without the rebates and discounts usually used to sell off the current year's models before new ones are introduced each fall.
"In a way, the Fed was right: enough demand existed to raise prices," said Wynn Van Bussman, a Chrysler economist. "But we did not want to alienate customers and lose them to competitors. In the compromise between holding onto buyers and getting more money, we canceled the incentives but we did not raise sticker prices."
Dealers did report scarcities of some popular models, but they were not the result of overtaxed assembly lines. Shortages of parts made by outside suppliers were to blame, said Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's vice president of procurement. Production of mini-vans equipped with anti-lock brakes, for example, was held back by a shortage of those brakes. So Chrysler helped the supplier, the Bendix division of the Allied Signal Corporation, increase its machining capacity.
In the few months this required, Chrysler could have shrunk demand by raising the price of mini-vans with anti-lock brakes. Instead, it tried to shift demand by offering discounts on mini-vans without such brakes.
"In the modern economy, consumers are not friendly to price increases and they have long memories," Mr. Stallkamp said. "It is better to say we have shortages and ask them to wait, or to shift demand to more available models through discounts."

HEADLINE: China Makes Trade Pleas

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 11

 BODY:
A senior Chinese official has urged the United States to end its remaining economic sanctions against Beijing and to extend indefinite most-favored-nation trading status.
The China Daily today quoted Zhou Shijian, a senior official of the Foreign Trade Ministry, as specifying that Washington should end a ban on soft loans to China. 
 In the last few years, China has received soft loans and mixed credits for more than 1,000 projects from Canada, Japan and European countries, while the United States has stayed on the sidelines, Mr. Zhou said.
He said the United States should also end limits on high-technology exports, a move that would provide huge opportunities to American companies and help reduce Washington's trade deficit with Beijing.
The sanctions were imposed after China's military crackdown on student protests in June 1989.
Chinese figures show that in the first seven months of this year, China exported $10.5 billion of goods to the United States, up 29.7 percent from the comparable period in 1993. Imports from the United States were $6.9 billion, up 38.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Soon, a Serious Governor's Race

 BODY:
So far, this has not been an edifying gubernatorial race. New York is a proud but uneasy state with big problems like crime, education, a crushing Medicaid burden, a swollen public payroll and a stubborn recession.
But the issues that have so far dominated public attention include Republican front-runner George Pataki's real estate ventures, Gov. Mario Cuomo's speaking fees and the question of who is paying for the nursing home-care of Mr. Cuomo's mother and Mr. Pataki's father. Each side has also filed a lawsuit accusing the other of breaking the legal limits on campaign contributions. 
 These matters are legitimate grist for campaign debate, since they may help voters judge the candidates' integrity and character. But they are no substitute for a sustained debate about crime, mediocre schools, campaign finance reform, how to create a more hospitable business climate and how, precisely, the candidates intend to pay for the tax cuts they have promised.
In fairness, Mr. Cuomo and Richard Rosenbaum, the Republican underdog, have tried to sharpen the policy debate. Mr. Rosenbaum may not be around after tomorrow's primary, but he has at least said how he would try to revive the economy.
That puts him one up on Mr. Pataki, whose mudslinging reached a comical apotheosis when he released a Letterman-like Top 10 list of how he thinks Mr. Cuomo has used taxpayer money to enhance his life style, including the purchase of flea collars for his dogs. The Democrats then organized truth squads to bombard the press with Mr. Pataki's "10 top fibs."
For Mr. Pataki, this dithering around represents a blown opportunity to give himself personal and doctrinal definition. It is true that he had to spend much of the summer raising money. It is also true, as Mr. Cuomo points out, that apart from vague promises about cutting taxes and welfare Mr. Pataki has said very little about what he believes in and what he would do as governor.
Mr. Pataki, who has now offered to debate Mr. Cuomo, promises to set forth a more detailed agenda if he wins the primary. That would surely please his party. Most Republicans know that despite Mr. Pataki's lead in some polls their party cannot beat Mr. Cuomo without credible alternative policies. The underfinanced Mr. Rosenbaum, by contrast, has offered a detailed proposal to cut taxes by 24 percent and spending by $4 billion. Whether one likes his ideas or not, Mr. Rosenbaum has at least put them on the table.
As for Mr. Cuomo, he is now running for the history books. His candidacy carries the presumption that a fourth term would be a crowning achievement in which he would bring to closure many of his earlier promises.
The Governor has certainly been visible, zooming around the state to tout the local benefits of projects financed by Albany. And he is not short of ideas. His aides promise proposals on school financing, prisons and tax relief for businesses and individuals. But the voters really need a clear, thematic explanation of how a fourth term would build, extend and solidify what would become New York's longest executive tenure.
Though the last two gubernatorial races in 1990 and 1986 were walkovers for Mr. Cuomo against hapless opponents, a competitive race this year fought on issues of genuine concern to New Yorkers would be healthy all around. There is a precedent. Mr. Cuomo's race in 1982 against a sharp and ideologically committed opponent, Lewis Lehrman, was at times a riveting and stimulating competition, an educational exercise of high order that engaged New Yorkers in a way they have not been engaged since. There is still time for a sequel.

HEADLINE: When A.C. Was a Glint in Engineer's Eye;
The Forgotten Worker

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It seemed maddeningly appropriate, on the Labor Day closing a summer that saw the insurance industry buy a national consensus against universal health care, that the lead editorial of The Times -- America's newspaper of record -- celebrated the joys of air-conditioning. 
 One might have hoped to see a brief salute to all the men and women throughout American history who had their skulls dented or smashed to win a living wage. One might have hoped for some recognition of the small, debt-plagued farmers who fed and clothed our young nation, and lined the pockets of its bankers.
One might have hoped for some mention of the millions who still must endure unsafe working conditions for subsistence wages: the Asian and Latino immigrants sewing away in locked sweatshops down the street from your air-conditioned offices, the migrant farm worker breathing in lungfuls of pesticides, the millions who work part-time, no-benefit jobs in the service sector.
These are the people who make our economy run. If they had been born in any other Western industrialized country, they would be entitled to lifelong health care, as well as the representation of a political party at least nominally committed to their interests. Instead they are here in America, where Labor Day is an occasion to appreciate air-conditioning.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Press Notes

BYLINE: By William Glaberson 

 BODY:
THE American newspaper industry, humbled by slipping advertising revenue in recent years, is showing strong signs of returning health.
Revenue from advertising in newspapers across the country for the first half of this year showed the strongest gains since 1987, according to industry data, and the advertising is projected to remain stable. As a result, the earnings of most big newspaper companies are improving. 
 "We believe it is very, very good news," said Cathleen Black, the president of the Newspaper Association of America, the publishers' trade group. "The very slow recovery has begun to come home."
A recent report by the association said ad revenue increased 6.25 percent during the first half of the year, compared with the corresponding period last year. And the group is projecting a 6.7 percent gain for the entire year, compared with 1993.
That level of growth would be the biggest increase since 1987, when newspapers' advertising revenue grew 9 percent, to $29.4 billion. The trade group is projecting ad revenue of $34 billion for the industry this year, up from $31.9 billion last year.
Sluggish advertising the last several years and drastic declines in the early 1990's highlighted long-term problems for newspapers, including declining readership, increasing competition for advertising dollars and the disappearance of longtime advertisers like department stores.
Those problems, industry analysts say, continue to haunt the future of the nation's newspapers.
Some analysts say the dose of business reality has sobered newspaper publishers in a lasting way. And some say the new bottom-line orientation at newspapers across the country is likely to remain. Cost-containment programs and more aggressive business competitiveness, they say, are now permanent parts of the industry.
"The industry is not on its deathbed by a long shot," said Kenneth T. Berents, a media securities analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond. "But it has changed. The question remains: How strong will it be in the long term?"
But for now, at least, publishers can be forgiven for pinching themselves as they notice they are still alive after all.
 
The Journal's Latin Voice
 Last week, more than 1.1 million newspaper readers in Latin America could read The Wall Street Journal's account of a banking scandal in Mexico and learn about the travails of Berlin's only legally sanctioned shoeshine man.
They could read those and other articles on economic and business news in their own big-city newspapers. In Spanish. And they could read them on the same day they were published in The Journal in the United States, Asia and Europe.
The Wall Street Journal Americas, a daily two- to three-page section inserted into eight newspapers in Latin America, is the latest expansion by the flagship newspaper of Dow Jones & Company. The section began publication last month in newspapers in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.
"The idea behind expansion is that we think the global business person in Buenos Aires or Santiago needs the same business information as the business person in New York or Dallas," said Bill Casey, director of development for the international business development group at Dow Jones.
The unusual section is translated, edited and laid out by editors at The Journal's headquarters in New York and sent digitally to a computer in Miami. Each Latin American newspaper then retrieves the prepared pages electronically and inserts them in time for the next day's press run.
The newspapers can sell local advertising for some space and keep the revenue. The Journal's advertising staff sells pan-Latin advertising to run in all the papers and then splits that revenue with its partners.
The Digital Equipment Corporation is the first pan-Latin advertiser in the new section. Diane Spencer, director of print services for Young & Rubicam in New York, said the advertising agency had advised Digital to make the purchase partly because the identification with The Journal provided the right image for a big corporate advertiser.
"We're trying to reach key business influencers in these countries," Ms. Spencer said. The Journal, she added, has invented a novel way to do that.
 
Sobering News on Salaries
 Generations of aspiring journalists have been advised that journalism won't make you rich. A new study shows that guidance, for beginning journalists at least, to be as true as ever.
In an annual survey of salaries conducted by Ohio State University's School of Journalism, 2,556 graduates of undergraduate and graduate schools of journalism or mass communications were interviewed. Those who went to work for newspapers, the study found, earned a median starting salary of $18,200.
According to Lee P. Becker, one of the professors who conducted the study, salaries paid to new journalists have not kept pace with inflation since he began directing the study nine years ago. In 1985 dollars, he said, salaries paid to new journalists have slipped from the equivalent of $14,800 in 1990 to the equivalent of $13,600 last year.
Mr. Becker said most of the entry-level jobs obtained by the recent graduates he interviewed were at smaller newspapers.
He said that having spent years studying salaries for new journalists he had come to a conclusion that raised questions about the future of the nation's news organizations. "I think you can't expect to get workers of high quality if you aren't willing to pay them very much," he said.

HEADLINE: Bargain Zoning in the Big City;
New York Seeks an Economic Lift, Suburban Style, by Wooing Discount Stores

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
Stretched across the open doorway at the store entrance on a recent morning was a red-and-gold ribbon with a fancy bow tied in the middle. Outside, almost 300 people waited impatiently in line, clutching fliers promising gifts. Inside, dozens of employees clapped and cheered as the opening of the largest free-standing home appliance and electronics store in New York City drew near.
"The name of the game is jobs," said Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, just before she cut the ribbon at the new 75,000-square-foot Tops Appliance City superstore on Northern Boulevard in Long Island City that will employ 350 people. "Thank you for this expression of faith in the future of Queens." 
 If the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has its way, such ceremonies, trumpeting the opening of big, suburban-style discounters, supermarkets and megastores, will be increasingly common in New York.
City officials, looking to fill the void left by the long decline of manufacturing and the loss of many of New York's department stores, say they can create more jobs and generate higher tax revenues by attracting large retailers. They hope to lure residents to shop in the city rather than drive to the suburbs to stock up on groceries and buy large items.
To do this, officials are suggesting that areas of the city long restricted largely to industrial activities be opened to much wider uses, including big retail stores.
Given the absence of demand for new office buildings, a decision to encourage an influx of superstores is likely to do far more during the next decade to shape economic development in the city -- particularly outside Manhattan -- than any other City Hall policy.
 
Conflict With Urban Life
 But to opponents, such plans threaten to unleash forces they fear would undermine the special urban character of New York City, one of the few cities in the United States that still have a host of dense neighborhoods where residents can walk to local shops.
Small merchants worry that the big stores could drain the lifeblood of many neighborhood shopping districts. Some urban thinkers, arguing that the auto-oriented life style of the suburbs is incompatible with the city, contend that zoning should be used to limit rather than encourage isolated warehouse stores surrounded by large parking lots.
"If you build a single big box and surround it with blacktop, those shoppers walk by nothing but other cars," said Roberta Brandes Gratz, author of "The Living City," which is being reissued and updated this year by Preservation Press. "We shouldn't assume that the suburban model of the past 50 years is the only one. Big retailers can be O.K., but only if they are told they must fit into the framework of the urban New York model. Otherwise, we should just say no."
To most city officials, however, this attitude represents little more than nostalgia for the long-lost days before shopping malls as well as an ignorance of economic trends that favor suburban areas.
"It's long past time to bring our zoning laws up to date with the real world," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "New York can't afford to turn large retailers away at the border just because they don't fit someone's image. We're losing sales taxes and jobs to the suburbs that should be ours."
 
Shaping Development
 This month, the City Planning Department plans to release detailed recommendations for ways to make it far easier for large retailers to operate in the city. The department, with the blessing of Mayor Giuliani, is expected to propose, among other things, raising the size limit on most stores in areas zoned for manufacturing to 100,000 square feet (roughly the size of two football fields) or more, from the current 10,000 square feet.
The Giuliani proposal follows suggestions made in early 1993 by city planners under Mayor David N. Dinkins aimed at redeveloping abandoned and underused industrial areas through zoning changes.
Stephen DiBrienza, a City Council member from Park Slope, Brooklyn, predicts that the proposal faces a tough political battle. "The superstore issue raises a number of sensitive questions," he said. "We're going to look at it very closely."
Already, many large retailers are seeking special permits that would exempt them from current land-use restrictions. Kmart, for instance, has applied to build a 123,000-square-foot discount store across the street from Tops, on land where Ronzoni pasta was once made. It is also negotiating to acquire a 9.5-acre site on the edge of Park Slope.
Many more developers are likely to follow suit if the Planning Commission and the City Council agree to Mayor Giuliani's plan to untangle the labyrinthine requirements to obtain a zoning variance and open thousands of acres of underused industrial land to wholesale redevelopment.
 
New York Losing Retailers
 From 1984 to 1991, 92 percent of the new retail stores built in the New York metropolitan area, totaling almost 50 million square feet, were constructed outside the city, according to the F. W. Dodge Group, a construction research unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.
While New York City's share of personal income earned in the region has dropped to 43 percent in the early 1990's, from 50 percent in the early 1960's, it has lost a far bigger share of retail sales. They fell to 34 percent from 48 percent, city planners found. As a consequence of that and other factors, retail employment in the city has declined to less than 350,000, from 440,000 in 1968.
But now, many large retailers -- Home Depot, Sports Authority, Caldor and others -- increasingly see New York and other large cities as the last untapped territory in a national landscape saturated with suburban shopping centers. The year-old Home Depot store in Ozone Park, Queens, for instance, is already one of the most popular in the nation. Executives at Tops, which now has eight home appliance stores in the New York area, say they expect the new Northern Avenue outlet -- their first in the city -- to exceed $100 million in annual sales and quickly become the chain's biggest revenue generator.
To build high-volume, low-profit-margin stores that draw customers from a wide area, retailers need large parcels of land, sometimes 10 acres or more, for sales, storage and parking. Only a few such sites that are already zoned for commercial and retail use are available in the city.
The general absence of large supermarkets, which have a wider food selection and lower prices than most local grocers, particularly grates on many city residents.
 
Complaint of Subsidies
 "Just because we live within the boundaries of New York City, why should we be stuck with just one type of store?" asked Pat Oettinger of the Queens Citizens Organization, a church-based community group that supports Pathmark's efforts to open a warehouse-sized supermarket in Springfield Gardens in southeast Queens. "Not only would that bring more jobs for our young people into the community, it would also force the existing grocers to upgrade their merchandise. Competition should be healthy for everybody."
Studies by the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit group, and the Planning Department have found little harm, if any, to neighborhood grocery stores after supermarkets moved in nearby.
But many small merchants remain fearful. "The megastores do nothing to build up the neighborhoods, which are the lifeblood of the city," said Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York. "The big supermarkets abandoned the city in the 1970's, leaving a vacuum that immigrant businesses filled. Now they want to come back, but only on their terms and with a host of unfair subsidies. This is not free competition."
Mr. Kim and leaders of several other merchant associations complain that the big chains are unfairly aided by special packages including tax abatements and energy rebates. The associations help support the efforts of a lobbyist, Richard Lipsky, who is the most outspoken opponent of the zoning changes. He is also active in campaigns to stop several big retailing projects. "I like being David to their Goliath," Mr. Lipsky said.
But behind Mr. Lipsky, his critics say, are not just small storekeepers but a network of big locally based wholesalers, like Krasdale and White Rose, that help finance and supply many local grocers in the city. Mr. Lipsky does not receive any financing from the wholesalers, he says, but acknowledges that they generally favor his stance.
 
'Downhill Ever Since'
 It is certainly not easy to survive as a traditional independent retailer against the big chains. For instance, not far from Tops, on Steinway Street -- the popular shopping street for Astoria and Long Island City -- Fairway Lumber, a small lumberyard and hardware store, is going out of business after 49 years at the same location.
"We expanded six years ago to serve the neighborhood better and it has been downhill ever since," said Vincent Napolitano, president of Fairway. "A bad economy, along with the entry of Home Depot and Pergament nearby, did us in. For every job they create, they destroy two or three others."
Still, not all smaller merchants are convinced that the big megastores will wipe out everything around them. "We welcome Tops," said David John, store manager of the Big Daddy home appliance store on Steinway Street. "It will give everyone a chance to see that their prices are actually higher than ours. Competition is a two-way street."

HEADLINE: MUSIC REVIEW;
Operas on Willful Women and Pliable Men

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Like many another American arts institution, the San Francisco Opera fell on hard financial times recently and had to adopt stringent austerities. But with one exception, these showed little onstage during the glittery first weekend of the company's 72d season, which was filled with big-name singers in new productions.
Perhaps taking a cue from a 1993 book by George Martin, "Verdi at the Golden Gate," the company opened on Friday evening with Verdi's "Macbeth." On Saturday evening it repeated the theme of the strong-willed, malicious woman who wreaks havoc through a weaker male proxy with the premiere of Conrad Susa's "Dangerous Liaisons." 
 Lotfi Mansouri, the opera's general director, oversaw the production of "MacBeth," and here, especially in the set design by Gerard Howland, some of the budget-cutting became apparent. Artistically, Mr. Mansouri seems determined to show, this season, that the best economic defense is a good offense. He is presenting no fewer than seven new productions (with Verdi's "Trovatore," Rossini's "Otello," Wagner's "Tannhauser," Massenet's "Herodiade" and Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor" to follow), all designed by Mr. Howland with an eye toward mass-production efficiencies.
The main element was a facing wall, which opened in sections and flaps and sprouted staircases and platforms. For all its spareness, which no number of bobbingly suspended witches or other garish effects could conceal, it was nonetheless distracting in its constant adjustments and reconfigurations.
But any fears that San Francisco audiences might have to face the same unyielding structure through seven operas were dispelled on Saturday by Colin Graham's elegant production of "The Dangerous Liaisons." Commissioned by the company, Mr. Susa's opera, with libretto by Philip Littell, is based on the 18th-century novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, which has inspired several films, including one from 1988 based on a popular play by Christopher Hampton.
Since the novel consists entirely of letters among the principals, any dramatic structure based on it is likely to vary in emphasis from any other. In contrast, for example, to the 1988 film, Mr. Littell's distillation lends the characters a certain depth and concreteness. The history and thus the motivations of the manipulative Marquise de Merteuil are deftly limned. And the Vicomte de Valmont, while philandering with a vengeance (or without, no matter to him), maintains a modicum of humanity, which makes his ultimate breakdown not only believable but, on some minimal level, touching.
The humanity of the characters was seconded here by Mr. Graham's canny stage direction. If in the end these creatures, mindlessly bound up in their religious or societal pieties or their sexual adventures and retributions, still seemed insubstantial and unsympathetic, they were nevertheless faithful inhabitants of the world Laclos imagined.
Mr. Susa's music, in its perfumed decadence, was also an honest mirror, grateful for the singing voice but unflattering in its import. Partly because of its very effectiveness in its sinuous, manipulative melodicism and its avoidance of straightforward cadence or gesture, it was difficult to warm to.
A composer could hardly hope for a better premiere than the San Francisco Opera gave "The Dangerous Liaisons," in both casting and production. Thomas Hampson was an ideal rogue as Valmont, dashing in voice and mien. ("One does not applaud the tenor for clearing his throat," Glenn Close's Merteuil said to John Malkovich's Valmont in the film after an easy seduction, but of course this hormone-driven villain had to be a baritone.) And the women impressed even more, in both quality and variety.
The ease with which Frederica von Stade can transcend her familiar boyish persona and nice-guy image should no longer come as a surprise, but the depth of her portrayal here, with world-weariness and cynicism festering under a beauteous surface, was remarkable. Renee Fleming was superb as the married Madame de Tourvel, Valmont's target of choice, and Mary Mills, a young soprano with a lovely, pure tone, showed considerable promise as the betrothed Cecile de Volanges, Valmont's target of Merteuil's choice.
Johanna Meier sang Madame de Rosemonde strongly. Some roughness of tone in Judith Forst's portrayal of Madame de Volanges could be ascribed to the character's age, and the callowness of David Hobson's tenor seemed similarly appropriate for the Chevalier de Danceny, Merteuil's prey.
The orchestra performed well for its music director, Donald C. Runnicles, once past some rocky wind playing in the introduction. The chorus made little effect in its offstage contributions. The lead characters articulated the English text with such admirable clarity that the supertitles proved distracting for the most part, though undeniably useful in the jumble of a few ensembles.
Still, the most striking aspect of the evening, after the lowering of expectations on Friday, was Mr. Howland's scenic design, in combination with Mr. Graham's stage direction. Using projections and reflections, Mr. Howland created a richly textured, subtly shifting visual fabric that enhanced the flow of Mr. Graham's conception. In all, this was as convincing an evening of theater as one is likely to see on an opera stage nowadays.
"Macbeth" had to settle for more modest virtues. Verdi, as George Martin colorfully demonstrates in his book, has been a favorite here since the 1850's, when the sprawling, brawling, mostly male populace attracted by the gold rush took opera to its inscrutable heart. But "Macbeth" has always had to struggle for a place in the Verdi canon in English-speaking countries, and although the San Francisco premiere, at Maguire's Opera House in 1862, "passed off with greater satisfaction and gratification than any opera yet given in the Pacific," by one newspaper account, the work evidently disappeared here until the 20th century.
While tending assiduously to the city's rich Verdi tradition over the decades, the San Francisco Opera has performed "Macbeth" relatively infrequently, in 1955, 1957, 1967 and 1986. And to judge from the tepid response of the festive opening-night crowd, it may not be back anytime soon.
Not that enthusiasm was necessarily warranted by everything that happened onstage. James Morris was splendid as Macbeth, robust of voice yet appropriately hesitant and confused in manner, and Robert Lloyd's matching splendor as Banquo made a listener regret all the more the character's early assassination.
But Gwyneth Jones, as Lady Macbeth, gave new evidence of her vocal troubles of the last decade or so, with a woolly sonority and a wobbly vibrato. True, prettiness is not the point; "I would like the Lady to have a harsh, stifled and hollow voice," Verdi wrote. Yet Ms. Jones was often harrowing above and beyond the call.
Hong-Shen Li was suitably noble as Macduff, in contrast to Stephen Guggenheim, a most unkingly Malcolm. The chorus was fine, the orchestra even better, and all responded well to Mr. Runnicles's baton.
"Macbeth" runs through Oct. 2, "The Dangerous Liaisons" through Sept. 27.

HEADLINE: Deciphering Rules In a Competition For Arts Grants

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
With $10 million in city and state money up for grabs, arts organizations throughout the city's five boroughs have been racing to turn in grant applications due today. Under the challenge-grant initiative, a plan announced with great fanfare in July, the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and the New York State Council on the Arts are each to award $5 million in grants to organizations able to match the grant money dollar for dollar with grants from other sources.
As details of the plan have become clearer in the last month, however, some arts administrators and officials at philanthropic foundations say it is unlikely that it will generate $10 million in new money from the private sector. Further, they say because the grants must be used to expand an institution's programs to draw an increased audience, they could actually harm many smaller arts institutions that need to stabilize their operations before undertaking an expansion. 
 Like many other arts administrators, Norma Munn, the chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, an advocacy group, praised the initiative not only as a gesture of support for the arts, but also for its treatment of culture as an industry that offers economic benefit. Nevertheless, Ms. Munn said the program would probably result in the redistribution of funds rather than the creation of money.
 
On Levels of Increase
 "It will encourage shifting within arts organizations from one program to another, and to a certain extent among funders from one organization to another," Ms. Munn said. "No one will be able to verify what the level of increase is."
Bob Crane, the vice president for programs at the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, said he agreed. "If we give $10,000 in general support, as we generally do, and an arts organization came back and asked for money under the challenge grant, we'd probably not increase it over the $10,000," he said. "But we'd be happy to target it in such a way that it loosened the money from the challenge grant. The new money is the state and city money. The foundation money is more an accounting procedure."
The program will work very well for certain kinds of organizations, arts administrators said, primarily for larger institutions with well-organized development offices and the kinds of donors who can write large checks quickly. It will also be a boon, they said, to smaller organizations that are on a firm footing and are already preparing to expand.
The Museum of Modern Art, for example, prepared a grant proposal to allow it to expand programs on Thursday and Friday nights and on Saturday mornings during an exhibition of Jacob Lawrence's "Migration Series," to run Jan. 12 through April 11, 1995, which is a series of paintings depicting the movement of blacks from the South to the industrial cities of the North in the postwar period.
 
'We Want to Do More'
 "For us this is a stroke of luck," said Dan Vecchitto, the museum's director of development, who said the Modern would apply for a $250,000 matching grant. "We want to do more programs that reach out to the African-American community and schools. We hope we can build an audience and that they'll come back."
Davis Hall at City College is also well positioned to take advantage of the grant money. "This comes at a timely period for us, as we've just gone through a major campaign to firm up our infrastructure, and we're also increasing our programming," said David Rodriguez, the executive director of Davis Hall. He said Davis Hall would apply for $50,000, the greatest amount allowable under the rules for an institution with a budget of its size. Mr. Rodriguez said that Davis Hall already had pledges in hand, but that the money could not have been raised without the challenge grant.
Holly Block, the executive director of Art in General, an alternative art gallery in Manhattan, said she planned to apply for the smallest possible grant in her category, $5,000 from the city and the state. "I have no interest in trying to dream up a program to fit the guidelines," she said. "I think people are really hesitant to take on a challenge to find new money."
 
On Distributing Money
 Patricia McNeill, executive vice president of J. C. Geever, a company that raises money for nonprofit arts institutions, said: "What they should be doing is giving money for operational expenses. For special projects, let the arts groups turn to the foundations, which is what the foundations increasingly are geared for."
Officials at the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and the state arts agency say that whatever its shortcomings, the mere existence of the plan, in a year when the city is preparing to cut its arts budget by $4.6 million, is no small achievement. "It's a miracle," said Kitty Carlisle Hart, the chairwoman of the state arts commission. "It was very, very difficult."
Money was not the only obstacle. The City Department of Cultural Affairs and the State Council on the Arts have different systems for awarding grants. Like the National Endowment for the Arts and most other arts organizations, the state sets up peer panels to review and approve grants. The city adheres to a set of formulas that have evolved over time and that many arts administrators regard as highly politicized.
About 85 percent of city money goes to 31 institutions known as the cultural-institutions groups, most of them on city land or in city buildings. The remainder goes to several hundred organizations known as program groups. The percentage split between the two categories has been a contentious issue in recent years, and this year the city amended the formula, giving about 23 percent of its grant money to the program groups. Only the program groups make use of peer panels in approving grants.
 
Resulting in a Hybrid
 The different methods used by the city and state led to a clash in deciding how the challenge grants should be administered, with each side insisting on its own system. "We had what diplomats call a 'free and frank exchange of views,' " said Schuyler G. Chapin, New York City's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs.
In the end, the State Council on the Arts held its ground, resulting in a hybrid that leaves many arts administrators wondering what will happen when the state and the city sit down to parcel out the money. The city is committed to disbursing the money to the cultural-institution groups and the program groups in a ratio of 5 to 3, and arts administrators have expressed fears that the panel it appoints to review grant applications will dole it out with the primary goal of pleasing political constituencies. Mr. Chapin said he expected the panel to be named this week.
The state is not bound by the 5-to-3 formula. Moreover, the state does not give grants to some of the cultural-institutions groups, like the Staten Island Zoo and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, which it does not define as cultural institutions.
One undisputed triumph did emerge from the discussions between the city and states arts officials: a simple, straightforward and short application form.
"Last month, when I addressed a meeting of the Mayor's cabinet and held up the application form, there was a stunned silence, and then everyone burst into applause," said Mr. Chapin.
 
'The Jury Is Out'
 The short timetable for the challenge grants has put pressure on arts organizations and financing sources alike. Grant applications are to be approved in November, and the winning organizations will have until three months before the end of their fiscal year to find the matching funds. For most organizations, that date is April 1.
"I think the jury is out until we see how the awards are made,"
said Jenny Dixon, the executive director of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. "The outcome I hope for is that some groups that have not had access to city dollars, that have been well regarded on the state level, will start to get some city money." Mr. Chapin said: "We will slip on banana peels, we will fall, and we will get up. That's inevitable in a program that's totally unprecedented. But in the end we will put new money into the arts community."

HEADLINE: Steep Hurdles for Rescue

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
TAKING an ecosystem-wide approach to the management of Yellowstone, as many conservation biologists argue is the only effective approach, might require some over-arching political authority, given the near-impossibility of forging an alliance among the ecosystem's welter of political and administrative jurisdictions. But opponents appear to have killed off, at least for now, any attempt to impose such an arrangement.
As recently as four years ago, greater Yellowstone was being touted as a first-class laboratory for ecosystem management. But in the Bush Administration, highly organized defenders of extractive industries and private property succeeding in killing a "vision document" for the ecosystem's future that had been drafted by Federal agencies. Opponents attacked the document as part of an environmentalist plot to "lock up" land against development and exploitation, and their conservative allies in Washington prevailed. 
 Although the concept of an ecosystem-wide approach to conservation has been generally promoted by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, the Clinton Administration is not about to try to foster the approach in Yellowstone by trying to impose an ecosystem-wide management plan devised in Washington. "That kills it," said George Frampton, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for fish, wildlife and parks.
Rather, he said, the Administration's approach will be to emphasize the state, local and private role as being critical and decisive in land-use issues, while offering Federal help where possible and appropriate. Since local people have to live with the results, he said, "you have to push decision-making down to the local level."
Local communities have indeed begun to rein in development, historically a heretical idea in these conservative parts. Three of the region's fastest-growing counties -- those containing Bozeman, Jackson and Cody, the economies of which depend on the new wealth of recreation and population growth -- are taking steps to control the spread of subdivisions. The Cody area has declared a moratorium on development until it decides what to do. Jackson, with perhaps the most advanced effort, has adopted a county-wide land use plan that offers incentives for building outside ecologically sensitive areas and encourages "cluster developments," high-density subdivisions that would leave sufficient open space to accommodate wildlife.

HEADLINE: Latest Threat to Yellowstone: Admirers Are Loving It to Death

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.

 BODY:
A HIKER to the top of Mount Washburn in the heart of Yellowstone National Park may find it hard to believe that the wild land stretching out before him could ever be in serious jeopardy, so eternal does the spectacle seem.
From 10,243 feet, where marmots scurry about above the timberline, distant slopes garbed in evergreen forests alternate with the gold-beige velvet of grassy inclines and alpine meadows. Deep gorges, cascading cataracts and broad rivers cut through a sweeping vista punctuated by blue lakes and bright green mountain marshes. Close up, Yellowstone's incomparable geysers spout and its hot pools bubble, and the land abounds with the elk, bear, moose, deer, antelope, bison and bighorn sheep that have earned it the nickname "America's Serengeti." 
 The magnificent, world-famous landscape still ranks as the most nearly intact of big American ecosystems outside Alaska. But scientists and conservationists say that even Yellowstone's ecosystem is under increasingly serious threat from human pressure -- much of it, they say, exerted by the region's more committed admirers.
The park itself is merely the protected core of a vast, seamless ecosystem seven times as large. As big as West Virginia, it includes not only the jagged ranges of the Gallatin, Beartooth, Absaroka and Teton Mountains, along with the national forests that carpet their slopes, but also public and private lands that lie beyond them. "Everything in view is part of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem," Jim McKown, the park ranger who lives in his observation post at the top of Mount Washburn, says as he gazes into the distance. It is on private lands far from here, out on the ecosystem's ramparts, that the latest threat to its integrity has appeared. There, scientists and environmentalists say, a private real estate boom fueled by the desire of people to live close to Yellowstone's natural charms is eroding those charms and punching deep salients into the wild.
People "are literally loving the place to death," says Dr. Patrick Jobes, a sociologist at Montana State University in Bozeman, on the northern fringe of the ecosystem, who has joined with ecologists to study interrelationships among the region's people, economy and environment.
Some ecologists fear that unless it is controlled, a proliferation of subdivisions on private land will disrupt rhythms on which the ecosystem's biological health depends. Among the features believed to be at particular risk are these:
*River-valley habitats, which contain some of the ecosystem's richest assortments of plant and animal species.
*The purity of some of the region's cold, clear rivers and streams.
*Migration routes traveled by elk and other big ungulates as they move from the high country to lower elevations when winter approaches -- not to mention the winter habitat itself, much of which is on private land.
*Habitat of the threatened grizzly bear, the creeping loss of which is already forcing the scarce bears into no-win conflict with people.
This new hazard joins that of mining, logging, grazing and petroleum drilling in national forests and other federally owned lands outside Yellowstone and the adjacent Grand Teton National Park, which are themselves off limits. The latest alarm along these lines involves a plan to open a gold mine near Cooke City, Mont., in the Gallatin National Forest just outside the Yellowstone park borders. Environmentalists and some politicians vehemently object, for fear that poisonous waste, which must be contained forever, will ultimately escape from the mine and ruin some of the ecosystem's most beautiful streams.
But such exploitation of Federal lands may no longer be the most serious threat. Extractive industry has been far eclipsed, economists say, by a new economy founded on outdoor recreation and on the earnings of footloose businesses and residents, especially retirees, attracted by the natural wonders here. The resulting growth in population, development and general human traffic may now be responsible for the most intense ecological pressure.
These new realities are also changing the political equation that has governed the long-running struggle over Yellowstone's future. The dispute has commonly been cast as one between adherents to the status quo, who hold that the land is there for people to exploit, and conservationists, who say the ecological health of this international treasure should come first. Now the conservationists have an economic argument of their own: destroying the natural attractions on which the region's economy is now based would kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
The struggle's center of gravity is shifting perceptibly away from the Federal level, where it has become highly polarized, toward the state and local levels where private land-use decisions are made. There are signs that some early progress is being made toward reconciling the competing claims of ecology and economy.
 
Getting It Right in Yellowstone
 Conservationists believe the ecosystem is still robust enough that it can be sufficiently protected, and the new regional economy with it. "Not only can we get it right in Yellowstone, not to get it right would be an enormous black eye," said Louisa Willcox, the program director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a decade-old alliance of 110 environmental organizations based in Bozeman.
The boundaries of the ecosystem are necessarily fuzzy, varying according to who defines the system and on what criteria. But clearly the moist, hilly Yellowstone plateau and attendant mountain ranges stand out from the adjacent, drier plains in many ways. They display a rich and characteristic assortment of flora and fauna. The biggest elk population in North America, more than 90,000 strong, lives in greater Yellowstone, as does the largest herd of free-ranging buffalo and one of two main populations of grizzly bears remaining in the contiguous 48 states. The bears, listed by the Federal Government as a threatened species, number about 250 here.
The extensive ranges of elk and bears, whose travels help knit the ecosystem together, are one of its major defining features. So is its rich and characteristic assemblage of plant communities, dominated by forests. Douglas fir blankets lower elevations, lodgepole pine (by far the most common vegetative cover) rules the middle elevations, and Englemann spruce, alpine fir and whitebark pine drape the harsh regions just below the timberline in green festoons misshapen by the wind.
The region contains many smaller-scale ecosystems, and both they and the larger landscape undergo constant change at the hands of naturally recurring forces like insect infestations, lightning-set fires and climatic fluctuations. These rearrange vegetation, destroy old habitats while creating new ones and redirect the wanderings of wildlife. They are the agents of regeneration and biological variety.
Seemingly devastated ridges in Yellowstone testify to the power of the great fires that ecologists say occur unavoidably every two or three centuries. Countless acres of naked lodgepole pines, killed by the unstoppable blazes of 1988, still look gray and lifeless from a distance. But up close, new trees up to two feet tall can be seen poking their heads up.
In ways both subtle and obvious, humans are altering the terms on which these fluxes of nature take place. Much of Yellowstone's plant life, for instance, now consists of exotic Eurasian species that have spread across the continent, often displacing native species; hikers nearing the summit of Mount Washburn are greeted by dandelions, invaders from Europe. In another example, clear-cutting of timber in the national forests has eliminated the soil nutrients ordinarily replenished by fires, eliminated habitat for bird species that nest in dead trees and deprived streams of the logs that help create fish habitat. Logging roads have also cut the habitats of deep-woods animals into fragments. Regiments of hikers and snowmobilers are disturbing the back country in growing numbers.
And the wolf, Yellowstone's top predator and former keystone of its food pyramid, has long since been exterminated from the ecosystem. An experimental attempt to re-introduce it is to be made later this year or early in 1995.
 
'For Sale' Signs in Rich Ecosystems
 Humans' impact on the region's rivers and streams and the species-rich land along them is creating special concern. They appear to be the biologically richest parts of the ecosystem, and they happen to be where people like to congregate and build. Ecologists say stream-side real estate development could foul and heat waters now clean and cold enough for the region's prized trout -- magnets for droves of well-heeled fly-fishers -- as well as innumerable other aquatic species.
And the development is there. Subdivisions and "for sale" signs dot private property, for instance, along the Yellowstone River south of Livingston, Mont., along the North and South forks of the Shoshone River west of Cody, Wyo., and along the edges of forests outside Bozeman. The Snake River watershed outside Jackson, Wyo., in the ecosystem's southwestern quadrant, has long felt development pressures.
While private lands like these account for less than 20 percent of the ecosystem, their ecological importance is outsized, scientists say. In addition to their potential impact on stream quality, they contain a disproportionate share of riverside and low-elevation habitats for a wide range of wildlife -- from elk, moose and bears to eagles, ospreys, trumpeter swans and countless other birds. One especially big worry: since winter weather is a chief factor in regulating the size of ungulate populations, biologists fear that a return of severe winters would cause high mortality if migration routes from high country in the national forests and parks to lower elevations outside them are blocked by subdivisions and fences.
Already, conflicts between grizzly bears and people are taking place along the developing river corridors west of Cody. Bears forced by this year's hot, dry summer to forage in the valleys (sometimes at residents' garbage cans) are being trapped and released elsewhere. But wildlife officials expect that some will inevitably be killed, as often happens in bear-human confrontations. Even a single death is no minor threat to such a small population.
It seems certain to many scientists that the human impact is substantial, but just how substantial is not known. "Certainly, the impression among those who have lived here 20 or 30 years is that it's just black-and-white clear that the trends are very harmful to the integrity of the system, but there are no good quantitative measures of all that," says Dr. Tim W. Clark, a Yale University conservation biologist who has long lived and worked in Jackson.
Many ecologists and conservationists, including the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, believe the best way to attack the problem is to manage the ecosystem as a whole. The overriding goal would be to maintain its biological diversity and the natural processes that make it function, while allowing ecologically friendly human use of its resources. Rather than emphasizing the management of big animal populations in limited areas of the ecosystem, as has generally been done, the welfare of all species from bugs to bears -- and humans -- would be promoted simultaneously throughout the system.
Many agree that for now, at least, this can be done only at the state and local levels, with Federal help where it seems appropriate. And while a number of local communities have begun to rein in development in general, others have enacted regulations requiring development along rivers to be set back far enough from the bank so that riparian habitat and water quality can be preserved. This effort recently suffered a major setback, however, when county officials rejected such a plan for the Yellowstone River south of Livingston, where it flows through many miles of private property north of the park. Meanwhile, environmentalists are also negotiating conservation agreements with landowners along some of the ecosystem's rivers.
 
Enlisting Help From Ranchers
 On another front, Mike Clark, the executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, is conducting exploratory discussions with ranchers on ways to protect valuable wildlife habitats. Although grazing has some harmful ecological effects, ranchers have preserved habitats and migration routes for many animal species simply by keeping the lands they own open and undeveloped. The object now is to find ways to enable ranchers to keep their land intact in the face of intense pressure to sell to developers.
"In the Yellowstone area, the breakup of ranches may be the biggest threat to biodiversity there is," said George Frampton, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for fish, wildlife and parks. "So there, the Federal Government might want to continue to subsidize grazing and keep large tracts of land together because the alternative for wildlife is worse." Typically, ranchlands are an amalgam of public and private property.
Under a law signed last year by President Clinton, the Yellowstone coalition is also instrumental in exchanging tracts of private land lying athwart a major elk migration route within the Gallatin National Forest for other lands outside the ecosystem.
That is how the effort to preserve greater Yellowstone is now proceeding: not according to some grand, all-encompassing blueprint, though blueprints do exist, but step by step, in a hard-slogging campaign at many governmental levels to save the ecosystem one piece at a time.

Seiko Plans Wristwatch With Worldwide Paging

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 12

 BODY:
In what sounds like something out of the Dick Tracy comic strip, the Seiko Corporation said today that it planned to develop a worldwide paging service that would deliver messages and other information to wristwatch receivers.
But unlike the two-way wristwatch radios used by the cartoon detective, the Seiko watches cannot receive voice messages, only text messages limited to 16 digits or letters. 
 The Japanese watchmaker envisions that subscribers will use its watches to receive sports scores, traffic alerts, stock quotes, bank balances, winning lottery numbers and messages to call the office.
 
Expanding in U.S.
 The company has offered the wristwatch paging service in Seattle and Portland, Ore., for about a year and a half and has about 14,000 subscribers.
Now, Seiko plans to expand service to 20 cities in the United States by the end of 1995 and to more than 50 American cities by the end of 1996, Yoshiyuki Narahashi, a company official, said at a news conference here today.
The service is also being introduced in Europe and parts of Asia, said Mr. Narahashi, who is the president of Seiko Communications B.V., a new subsidiary with headquarters in the Netherlands that will develop the system.
Seiko said its worldwide service would be the first one that was affordable, but it might take many years before the service was truly global. MTEL International, based in Washington, already offers international paging. There are also several nationwide paging services in the United States.
Michael Krier of Economic and Management Consultants International, a consulting firm in Washington that specializes in wireless communications, said Seiko was moving into a crowded field. Paging technology is also changing rapidly.
Mr. Narahashi said that Seiko would be able to offer less expensive service than existing paging services. While conventional systems require their own towers and antennas, Seiko will transmit messages over existing FM radio stations, using the FM subcarrier, a part of a radio station's signal that does not carry music. Seiko said its system could also transmit faster than conventional paging systems.
 
$6.95 a Month in Some Places
 In Seattle and Portland, the service costs as little as $6.95 a month for unlimited messages plus a $20 sign-up fee. Customers also have to buy a receiver watch selling for $100, which is now being reduced to $80. Mr. Narahashi said the fee for nationwide service would also be about $6.95 a month.
The technology used by Seiko was first developed by AT&E, a start-up company in San Francisco that attracted attention in the late 1980's. A company official predicted that AT&E would have 10 million subscribers by 1994 for wristwatch worldwide paging. But AT&E never could fulfill its ambitions and failed financially in 1991. Seiko, which had been providing the wristwatch receivers for AT&E, took over the company and the service.
The original wristwatch receivers were rather clunky and cost nearly $300. But with inevitable improvements in chips, Seiko's receiver is now the size of a normal wristwatch with a liquid crystal display.
The service will not be limited to wristwatches. The same information can be sent to notebook computers, radios and new information appliances that are sometimes called personal digital assistants.

HEADLINE: Gibson Files Lawsuit Over Derivatives

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Gibson Greetings Inc. sued the Bankers Trust Company yesterday, accusing it of "deception, cheating and fraud" in connection with a series of financial transactions known as derivatives.
In April, Gibson said it was taking a charge of $19.7 million because of several derivative transactions. 
 Bankers Trust, based in New York, said in a statement that its actions were "legal, proper and appropriate." It declined to discuss the details of Gibson's charges.
This is the first legal action by any of the half-dozen prominent companies that disclosed losses related to derivatives earlier this year. The Procter & Gamble Company, which said that it had lost $157 million in transactions also with Bankers Trust, said yesterday that it was still considering legal options.
 
An Obligation Claimed
 The suit by Gibson, a greeting card company based in Cincinnati, argues that Bankers Trust had an obligation to disclose more fully the risks of the derivative transactions and perhaps to protect the company from them. It seeks $73 million in damages.
Bankers Trust is expected to respond that as in most financial transactions among large corporations its derivatives dealings with Gibson were at arm's length. In other words, "buyer beware."
Many derivatives experts sympathetize with Bankers Trust's position. "It's just human nature when a trade goes against you, you find someone to blame," said Leslie Rawl, a partner in Capital Market Risk Advisers, a derivatives consulting firm in New York.
She said a number of other companies posted losses related to derivatives but had not made them public.
Like most large companies, Gibson had begun using a very common form of derivative known as an interest-rate swap in order to reduce the cost of its interest payments on the money it borrowed. Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is based on, or derived from, an underlying financial asset like interest rates, in the case of swaps, or stocks or commodities.
The lawsuit, filed in Federal court in Cincinnati, says the company was encouraged by Bankers Trust to enter into increasingly complex swap structures that were more speculative and volatile than Gibson realized. These contracts lost value rapidly this spring as interest rates began to rise sharply.
In addition to large corporations, a number of mutual funds and other investors have found that this year's rising interest rates have caused more damage than expected to some derivatives and other complex financial concoctions like certain mortgage-backed securities that had been designed to profit from declining interest rates.
The derivatives debacle at Procter & Gamble, for example, has shaken its upper management. Edwin Artzt, Procter & Gamble's chairman, said earlier this month that he had turned down $100,000 of his $420,000 annual bonus because of the derivatives losses. In addition, P.& G. disclosed yesterday that Raymond D. Mains, who had been the company's treasurer when the derivative transactions occurred, had retired as of Sept. 1. He had been on "special assignment" since the derivative problems emerged April, the company said.
"We're not surprised Gibson has filed suit," Mr. Artzt said in a statement yesterday.
 
'Cheating' Charged
 In its complaint, Gibson describes itself as financially unsophisticated and dependent on Bankers Trust, which the company says is its "lead bank" for advice and guidance regarding a series of swaps meant to reduce the interest cost of $30 million of bonds that Gibson had issued. Gibson contended that Bankers knew that it had policies to maintain a conservative financial posture.
The company accused Bankers Trust of "cheating Gibson out of nearly $500,000" in relation to several swap transactions that actually earned a profit in 1992. Gibson charges that Bankers paid it $260,000 to close out transactions that it subsequently learned to be worth $750,000.
After that, the suit says, Bankers Trust "recognized its opportunity for gain at the expense of an unknowing customer and, ignoring its obligation as Gibson's adviser and banker," solicited Gibson to enter at least 16 additional transactions.
The suit also asserts that Bankers Trust "knowingly and deliberately did not reveal the material risks and misrepresented the nature of the transactions and thereby deceived and defrauded Gibson."
At least one of those transactions committed Gibson to make a series of payments that would be determined by a formula involving taking the square of a common short-term interest rate known as Libor, for London interbank offered rate. By squaring the formula, Gibson's costs would increase rapidly as rates went up. Gibson says the disclosure of risks by Bankers Trust were inadequate.
In particular, the company says that the bank's disclosure assumed that the transaction would be held to maturity and did not how the market value of the swaps could fall during their life. Gibson had planned to use an accounting treatment for the swaps that did not recognize changes their changes in value.
But like executives at many other companies, Gibson's accountants changed their view when the market dropped and forced it to recognize its losses early. Gibson charges that Bankers Trust should have warned that its planned accounting treatment would be inadequate.
Among other charges of impropriety, Gibson says that at 11 P.M. on March 3, Bankers Trust gave the company an "ultimatum" that it had to pay the bank $17.5 million by the next morning to cover losses on derivative transactions or enter into another transaction that would limit the company's losses to no more than $27.5 million. The company chose the loss-limiting transaction, which it later said publicly cost $3 million.
Gibson is claiming actual damages of $23 million and punitive damages of $50 million.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, The British Lift Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Hoping to choke off inflation before it imperils the nation's steady if unspectacular economic recovery, Britain raised its benchmark interest rate today by half a point, to 5.75 percent, its first rate increase since 1989.
Following similar rate increases in Italy and Sweden last month, the move in Britain's base rate for short-term lending offered further evidence that Europe was now joining the United States in one of the trickiest dances in economic policy-making, tamping down incipient inflationary pressures without stamping out the underlying growth. 
 The task will be all the more complicated because Europe will be moving to restrain economic growth even while unemployment rates remain near record levels.
"The U.K. move reinforces expectations that the interest rate cycle has turned in Europe," said a report today from Salomon Brothers, the investment firm.
Britain emerged from the worldwide recession a year or so later than the United States, where the Federal Reserve began attacking inflation in February through a series of rate increases. But Britain is further on in its recovery than Germany and most of the rest of Western Europe.
 
Shift in Outlook on Germany
 Until recently, most analysts were convinced that the Bundesbank in Germany would cut rates one more time in the next few months to give that nation a final push out of its deep recession. But the combination of stronger-than-expected growth figures and the rate rises in Britain, Italy and Sweden has now led some economists to conclude that the Bundesbank will not cut again and that Europe's rate-cutting cycle has come to an end.
"Stronger European growth prospects, which encouraged the U.K.'s pre-emptive action, also make it unnecessary for the Bundesbank to cut rates further," the Salomon Brothers report said.
After suffering its worst downturn of the postwar era, the British economy is now growing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. Unemployment has been falling gradually from double digits to its current 9.4 percent rate. While high by American standards, it is relatively low for Europe. The American unemployment rate now is 6.1 percent.
Inflation, as measured by the retail price index, is expected to be 2.4 percent for this year, rising to around 3 percent next year. At those rates, inflation is well within the Government's target range.
But there are clear signs that long-term inflationary pressures are building as industry bids up the cost of labor and raw materials and seeks to restore its profit margins. Just moments before announcing the rate increase, the Government said prices of goods as they left factories had risen three-tenths of a percent last month, which is higher than expected.
For the last several weeks, economists had been predicting a pre-emptive strike against inflation, although few analysts expected the Government and the Bank of England to act so soon. In raising interest rates, British policy makers hope to temper economic growth by making borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers.
Only once since 1989 has Britain sought to raise rates. That was two years ago, when the Government announced two rate increases on the same day -- from 10 percent to 12 percent and then to 15 percent -- in the midst of a frantic effort to defend the value of the pound during a run on European currencies. But the Government decided within hours to allow the pound to float in value and rescinded the rate increases before they came into effect.
The Conservative Government has publicly committed itself in recent months to breaking the boom-and-bust cycle that has plagued the economy here since World War II. Governments have repeatedly stimulated the economy out of recession through aggressive rate cuts, but then failed to keep inflation under control until they had no choice but to raise rates to extremely high levels. Official interest rates last peaked here at 15 percent in 1989.
"So often in the past, accelerating inflation has prevented us from enjoying sustained growth," said Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in announcing the rate increase today. "I am determined this will not happen again."
Mr. Clarke also told reporters at a news conference that the Government would not cut taxes this year, and would focus instead on efforts to continue bringing down Britain's budget deficit.
Today's rate increase was criticized by some business leaders, who said they feared that the increase came too soon and could, as the British Chambers of Commerce put it, "sabotage much of the gentle recovery we have seen."
 
Peril for Prime Minister
 The move also held political peril for Prime Minister John Major, whose popularity in opinion polls is at a low. Mr. Major has received little or no credit from voters for Britain's economic recovery, according to polls. The prospect of rising mortgage rates and other interest charges was seized on by the opposition Labor Party today as evidence of Mr. Major's economic mismanagement.
The interest rate increase came earlier than most economists had expected, and seemed intended in part to build credibility in the financial markets for the Government's anti-inflation efforts.
In that sense, the rate increase appeared to be working today. With investors more confident that inflation can be kept under control, bond prices rose, sending the yield on the benchmark 15-year Government bond, or "gilt," down by 9 basis points, to 8.69 percent, from 8.78 percent on Friday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Reaction on the London Stock Exchange was mixed, with the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares dropping by as much as 25 points during the morning then recovering somewhat to close at 3,128.8, down 10.5 points.

Treasuries End the Day Little Changed in Price

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as investors shied from placing bets before today's report on consumer prices.
Bonds tumbled on Friday, after a Government report showed a surprising surge in producer prices. The six-tenths of 1 percent gain in the Producer Price Index fed concerns that the Federal Reserve, despite five increases in short-term interest rates, had not subdued inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities like bonds. 
 Yesterday, the bond market was anxiously waiting to see if inflation had filtered down to consumers.
"Every precondition for inflation to rise has been in place," said Charles Lieberman, chief financial markets economist at Chemical Securities Inc. "Now it looks like the chickens have finally come home to roost."
The price of the 30-year bond fell 3/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.71 percent, from 7.70 percent on Friday, the highest since July 11. The yield on the two-year note was 6.34 percent, 2 basis points higher than its yield on Friday. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
At yesterday's weekly auction of Treasury bills, rates rose on concerns that inflation is picking up. The Treasury sold $11.6 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.61 percent, up from 4.58 percent last week. Another $11.7 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.99 percent, up from 4.89 percent.
The Consumer Price Index for August is expected to show an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent, and a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent when food and energy costs are excluded, according to a survey of economists. Inflation as measured by the C.P.I. was running at an annual rate of 2.7 percent through July, the same as for all of last year.
"If the C.P.I. confirms the P.P.I., then we'll head down again," said Andrew Brenner, senior government bond trader with the Nomura Securities Company International.
The August Producer Price Index showed wholesale price inflation running at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, compared with two-tenths of 1 percent for the first eight months of 1993, as well as for all of last year.
"There's no way you can make this look good," said Dennis Bushe, managing director at Prudential Investment Advisers in Newark, which has $12 billion in assets.
Even if the consumer prices report shows a less-than-expected increase, investors may not buy government securities because they are wary of economic reports later this week that could also suggest rising prices and faster growth.
The Government will report tomorrow on last month's retail sales and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, will deliver his periodic economic report to Congress. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia will release a regional price survey on Thursday, and the Fed will report Friday on industrial production and capacity utilization in August.
If the consumer price figures are better than expected, "people will still be looking forward to some relatively strong numbers," said Timothy Jay, head United States government cbond trader at Lehman Brothers. "If we get a bad one, then the market will continue to deteriorate."
The following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: President Leads Swearing-In Of New Corps of Volunteers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Raising his right hand and beaming like a proud scoutmaster, President Clinton swore in a group of the first 15,000 members of Americorps, the domestic Peace Corps that he promised in his campaign and that was authorized by Congress a year ago.
The members, most of whom will receive educational grants in exchange for their service, will begin work around the country in programs ranging from immunization efforts for children and the elderly to recycling, tutoring, crime prevention and urban revitalization. 
 Some 850 were inducted as more than 2,000 dignitaries and supporters took part in the ceremony on the North Lawn of the White House. They were kept sweltering there for more than two hours, and an elaborately synchronized satellite television transmission was thrown awry because of the crash of a light plane early this morning on the South Lawn, where the event was supposed to have taken place.
Mr. Clinton swore in five members in the Oval Office, and this ceremony was broadcast to more than 50 places around the country where members of the Cabinet, governors and mayors swore in groups of volunteers.
 
Not a Question of Money
 "Any of us could get a job that pays much more," said Russell C. Teter 3d, a 22-year-old from Middletown, N.Y., who will work in a psychiatric hospital for veterans. "I'm young, not married -- no children. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give something to my country."
For his part, Mr. Clinton seemed to exult in an opportunity to seize the moral high ground. In recent weeks, a rebellious Congress has apparently shelved his ambitious plan for expanding health insurance coverage, and he has had a difficult time in several areas of foreign affairs.
"I will get things done for America to make our people safer, smarter and healthier," the President said, leading volunteers in an oath written for the occasion. "Faced with apathy, I will take action. Faced with conflict, I will seek common ground. Faced with adversity, I will persevere. I will carry this commitment with me this year and beyond. I am an Americorps member, and I am going to get things done."
 
Favorite Clinton Idea
 The idea of a national service agency has been a favorite of Mr. Clinton's ever since he proposed it at a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council in May 1988.
Both Mr. Clinton and his aides were eager to link the National Service Corps with such warmly remembered predecessors as Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps of 1933 and John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps, which was created in 1961 and is still going.
"We hope our program will delight Americans in the same way that the Peace Corps has," said Eli J. Segal, chief executive of the Corporation for National Service.
Mr. Segal emphasized that the program had bipartisan support and took pleasure in ticking off a list of Republican governors and mayors, like Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who officiated at swearing-in ceremonies around the country.
Kimberly Barnes O'Connor, an aide to Senator Nancy L. Kassebaum, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources who led the fight against authorizing the program last year, said: "There has always been bipartisan support for the general concept. We would have preferred a slower growth rate, less Federal control and a few other things, but now it's the law and we hope it succeeds."
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, is less reconciled. "This program gives a lot of help to people who don't need it," he said.
 
'An Opportunity to Serve'
 Mr. Segal disputed the view. "This is not a jobs program or primarily a financial aid program, but an opportunity to serve," he said. "We never thought it wise to ask any one income group to perform national service.
"You might say we're doing two things at once. We're asking people to serve their country and in the process helping them with the cost of higher education at a time when those costs continue to skyrocket."
Under the present program, members will receive $7,500 a year for their living expenses and an education award of $4,725 a year for a maximum of two years to help finance their college education or vocational training, or to pay back their college loans. There are no restrictions on age.
Educators around the country said they were generally pleased with the program. Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, said: "It's the right program for the right time. Young people feel disengaged, but there are many signs that they're ready to be inspired by a larger commitment.
"The numbers are small, but the message is significant. Of course, it doesn't begin to solve the problem of college costs. That requires another solution."
The Corporation for National Service is sponsoring 350 programs in more than 700 communities around the country.

Dollar Declines vs. Pound After British Rate Increase

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a two-month low against the British pound yesterday after the Bank of England raised short-term lending rates to control inflation.
But the dollar rose against the German mark after Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition Government was dealt a setback in state elections, creating some doubts about its ability to retain power in next month's federal elections. 
 The pound rallied against major currencies after the Bank of England raised Britain's minimum lending rate to 5.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the first increase since October 1989. Higher rates make deposits in pounds more attractive.
"Everyone's attention was on the pound," said Sudir Patel, foreign exchange manager at Nationsbank of Texas, in Houston. "The rate increase was kind of a surprise."
Britain's increase stirred speculation that rates would rise across Europe, bringing a definite end to a two-year period of declines. The speculation started last month when Sweden and Italy raised their interest rates.
In late New York trading, the pound was quoted at $1.5695, up from $1.5530 on Friday, after trading at $1.5733, its strongest level since July.
By contrast, the dollar posted gains against the mark, rising to 1.5436 marks from 1.5376.
The dollar was steady at 99.18 yen, as traders awaited developments in trade negotiations between the United States and Japan. Many traders expect the dollar to rally if the two sides find a way to curb Japan's $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States.
Many traders and analysts had expected the dollar to rally this year as interest rates fell in Europe and rose in the United States, making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive. But the dollar slumped as concern about inflation sent stocks and bonds into a tailspin. That chased many foreign buyers out of the American markets, dampening their demand for dollars. With rates rising in Europe, the dollar's prospects are now even dimmer, traders said.
"The days of rate decreases in Europe have ended," said Joe Francomano, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. "The dollar's slump is going to continue."
The dollar tumbled against the mark and other currencies on Friday after the Government reported that producer prices in the United States rose six-tenths of 1 percent in August, an increase that was bigger than had been expected. The report caused concern that inflation would erode the value of dollar-denominated investments.
But the dollar steadied yesterday as traders awaited today's report on consumer prices.

Copper Nears a 4-Year High As Demand Remains Strong

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices rose to their highest level in almost four years yesterday as traders continued to see growing demand.
On other commodity markets, coffee and wheat prices rose, helping to lift the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities up 0.19 point, to 233.13. 
 As economies worldwide begin to recover, copper demand is rising for everything from plumbing fixtures used in new housing to wiring for cars and electric motors, analysts said. Copper consumption in the United States grew 9.8 percent in the first half from a year earlier, the United States Bureau of Mines said.
On the Commodity Exchange of New York, copper for September delivery rose 2.25 cents, to $1.211 a pound, the highest price for a contract about to expire since Oct. 26, 1990. Copper has risen 8.3 percent over the last two weeks.
Demand is so strong that warehouse operators cannot ship copper to customers as fast as they would like, forcing copper consumers to wait weeks for deliveries, said Richard Hirsch, vice president with the Sharps Pixley brokerage house in New York.
 
Coffee Prices Rise
 Coffee prices also jumped yesterday after another dry weekend in Brazil increased the prospect of further damage to trees already harmed by two frosts in June and July. The coffee contract for December delivery rose 7 cents, to $2.24 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Wheat prices rose to their highest level in almost nine months after the United States Department of Agriculture lowered production forecasts for several leading exporters, increasing expectations that world demand for American wheat will rise.
The agency projected world wheat reserves at 119.42 million tons, down 4.3 percent from its 124.86-million-ton estimate released last month, as a drought in Australia worsened. Australia, normally the world's fourth- largest wheat exporter, will ship only 9 million tons of wheat this year, down from 13.5 million tons last year.
The September wheat contract rose 4 cents, to $3.80 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level since Jan. 18.
"With the lower crops in other countries, they'll have to come to the U.S. for wheat," said John Kleist, director of agricultural research with Quantum Financial Services in Chicago.
Crude oil slipped for a third day amid concern that seasonal maintenance work at refineries is reducing demand for crude. Crude oil for October delivery fell 14 cents, to $17.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Congress Must Vote on Haiti

 BODY:
To invade Haiti without prior Congressional approval would short-circuit the United States Constitution. It would also leave the President with sole political responsibility if the operation turns sour. Yet that is just what the Clinton Administration now suggests it might do.
Neither of the situations usually cited as justifying independent action by the Commander in Chief -- military crisis or unexpected threat to national security -- exists in this case. To the contrary, Congressional deliberation is both practical and desirable, and there is plenty of time for it. 
 The Constitution vests the power to declare war in Congress while giving the President command of the armed forces. Those overlapping responsibilities have fueled generations of controversy.
Beyond indulging a natural tendency to press against a vaguely defined constitutional boundary, recent Presidents have invoked practical arguments for bypassing Congress, like the need for speedy response or tactical surprise. Under the threat of a missile-launched nuclear Armageddon on 20 minutes' warning, the idea of protracted Congressional deliberation could be made to look like an absurd 18th-century anachronism.
Cold-war Presidents also argued that military actions taken under the authority of treaty commitments or U.N. resolutions were not really wars, but "police actions" or "troop redeployments," and thereby exempt from constitutional requirements.
For years Congress was happy to avoid responsibility. But Presidential excesses in Vietnam drove Congress to reclaim some of its authority in the War Powers Resolution of 1973. This required Presidents to get timely Congressional approval whenever they placed U.S. troops at risk. Since then, Presidents have disputed the resolution's authority but sometimes fulfilled its provisions.
In 1991, Democrats in both houses insisted that President Bush get prior Congressional approval for Operation Desert Storm. Now, misplaced fealty drives many of those same Democrats to relieve President Clinton of the same responsibility.
That is poor governance and poor partisanship too. Democrats would do better to protect Mr. Clinton from enmeshing himself in a military action where most Americans see no compelling national interests at stake and in which the first casualties are likely to bring bitter recrimination.
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide still represents Haiti's legitimate government. But sending the Marines to restore him to power makes no sense even if, as some military experts predict, that turns out to be an afternoon's work.
A century of Latin interventions should have taught Washington that it cannot enforce democracy at gunpoint. Haitians elected Father Aristide and still support him, but even his legitimacy may not survive being installed by foreign troops.
It is frustrating to watch Haiti's generals sneer at sanctions, play games with the U.N. and systematically shoot down democratic leaders in cold blood. Their conduct warrants international ostracism and economic sanctions until they yield power, then generous and muscular support for the elected government that replaces them.
But the conditions that warrant an American invasion -- conditions that include broad public support and Congressional agreement -- are not in place at this time. Mr. Clinton should not abuse his powers and risk damage to his Presidency by plunging ahead.

HEADLINE: Deficit Reduction, Chapter and Verse

BYLINE: By Herbert Stein; Herbert Stein, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The other day I was surfing through the channels when I heard a spokesman for the Christian Coalition explaining his organization's platform. I was surprised to hear that one of the planks was balancing the budget.
I am not an expert on Christian doctrine -- or on Jewish doctrine either, for that matter -- but I have paid a lot of attention to arguments about balancing the budget. With one exception, I don't think I have ever heard it suggested that balancing the budget was a particularly Christian precept. 
 The one exception was a remark by Walter Heller, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers when John F. Kennedy was President. He said, dismissively, that balancing the budget was part of "the Puritan ethic." But Mr. Heller, although a smart fellow, was not an authority on Christianity.
I have consulted a concordance on the Bible. Apparently the word "budget" does not appear in either the Old or the New Testament. The word "balance" does appear about eight times, but never in connection with fiscal policy.
Perhaps I am being too literal in expecting to find a specific reference to balancing the budget in a sacred text. There may be a more general principle from which an injunction to balance the budget can be derived.
Probably the main moral or ethical question has to do with equity between the present generation and future ones. A common, although not universal, view among economists is that running a budget deficit enables the present generation to consume more than it would if it balanced the budget. This reduces the income of future generations by reducing investment. Thus, running a deficit can be regarded as a way in which the present generation puts a burden on the future, or the future generation makes a sacrifice for the present one.
What is the proper moral judgment of that? The Fifth Commandment says, "Honor thy father and thy mother." It does not say, "Thou shalt honor thy children and grandchildren." Thus one might say that the commandment not only sanctions but may even require running a budget deficit as a way for younger generations to sacrifice for older ones.
Of course, one can look at the question in another way. The Old and New Testaments both call on us to love our neighbors as ourselves. If "neighbor" can be interpreted temporally as well as spatially, we can say that the generations to come are our neighbors and we are instructed to show as much concern for future generations as for our own.
One implication might be that we should so behave that future generations will have as high per capita incomes as we do. This may tell us something about budget policy, but it does not tell us to balance the budget.
From 1973 to 1993, when the budget was never in balance and deficits averaged 3.6 percent of gross domestic product, real per capita G.D.P. rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent. That is enough to double per capita income in 50 years. In the high deficit years that began with the Reagan Administration, from 1981 to 1993, when deficits averaged 4.3 percent of G.D.P., real per capita incomes rose 1.5 percent a year. If loving future generations as ourselves is to be evidenced by leaving them per capita incomes as high as ours, that does not call for balancing the budget.
But our concern for the future will not be, or should not be, measured by real per capita G.D.P. alone. Our legacy will be something more serious than that. If we can leave our children a country free of the danger of war, with safe streets, reduced racial hostility, fewer miserable urban ghettos and an elevated culture, we will not have to apologize for leaving a larger Federal deficit, almost all of which our children will own.
Recently I heard some scientists discussing the research they were doing in the field of genetics. They were talking of the probability that as a result of their work the risk of breast cancer would be greatly reduced within 15 or 20 years. It seems to me that the willingness of our generation to invest in that research shows much love for the next generation. The scientists were at the National Institutes of Health. Their work was financed by the Government -- that is, financed in part by the deficit.

I am not arguing here against a policy of balancing the budget, for which there is something to be said. Nor am I arguing against the right of the Christian Coalition to support a balanced budget. They have the same right to do that as the National Association of Manufacturers or the Concord Coalition or anyone else.
But I do think there is an obligation not to mislead the public about the basis for one's support for balancing the budget or for any other policy. The Christian Coalition would be truer to its name, in my opinion, if it did not give the impression that its support for balancing the budget was derived from Christian doctrine.
"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," it is said. I believe that Federal budget policy falls in Caesar's domain. It is also said that "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain." I believe that means that one should not invoke the authority of God for propositions, however worthy on other grounds, for which God has given no sanction.

HEADLINE: Why Small Business Disliked Health Care Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Hooray for the collapse of health care social engineering! While the observation of a sickness in our delivery system was accurate, the diagnosis was faulty and the prescription truly horrific.
The problem with our system today is not too little insurance and government, but rather too much. Eighty percent of the $1 trillion spent on health care is affected by government subsidies. There is simply no rational reason for large-scale government involvement in this sector of our economy, nor for insurance to be involved in day-to-day patient care. 
 Medicare, Medicaid and tax deductions for employer-paid health insurance should be abolished. With the $300 billion thus saved, the Federal Government could reduce the deficit and at the same time afford targeted subsidies for medical expenses for the poor, as it does for housing (vouchers) and food (food stamps).
Private insurance can create portable, catastrophic coverage with a variety of deductibles that will socialize some of the costs of expensive illnesses. Below the catastrophic level, mandatory insurance creates more problems than it solves. If costs are ever to be controlled, consumers must want to say, "How much is this costing me, can I get it cheaper and better elsewhere, and will you guarantee your results?"
Today the consumer is told, "Don't worry, it's covered by insurance." With third-party payers, it is no wonder costs are out of control. If our food was mostly paid by someone else, wouldn't we be eating steak every night?
The practice of medicine is not an arcane priesthood that should be exempted from the discipline of private competitive markets. On the contrary, of all the professions it is the one where the consumer can, through education, best help to lower costs and improve outcomes.
With normal economic incentives to shop for the best service and with better pricing information, the same market forces will be brought to bear that have made our food and shelter not only the best, but the best value in the world. Government regulation and more insurance ("universal coverage") go in exactly the wrong direction.

HEADLINE: Mexican Government Panel Instills The Unfamiliar Idea of Competition

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 12

 BODY:
In a slender 20-story tower at the center of this city, a team of young bureaucrats is attempting to create what until recently was as unlikely to be found in Mexico as chili peppers that don't burn -- a competitive economy.
 The 140 economists, investigators and staff form the backbone of the Federal Competition Commission, which in its first year of operation has managed to anger, obstruct and scold some of Mexico's biggest companies. The commission has fined brokerage houses for bid-rigging in connection with the sale of Treasury notes. It has made the oil monopoly Pemex loosen its grip on the number of gas stations it supplies. It has even put an end to price-fixing by corner laundries. 
American companies doing business in Mexico, or planning to enter the Mexican market, stand to benefit from the commission's actions. By policing competition, the regulators can make the market freer and more open, essentially more like markets in the United States.
 However, some analysts here doubt the seriousness of trying to legislate competition in a country that still tolerates monopolies in oil, electricity and railroads.
 "The commission represents both a serious attempt to encourage competition, and basic window-dressing for this administration," said Roberto Salinas-Leon, executive director of the Center for Free Enterprise Research, a nonprofit institute in Mexico City.
 Neil Perry, former chief of research for the Mexico City office of Baring Securities, said the new commission was more than just symbolic. "It's been given some bite," he said, "but so far it's just been snipping at people's ankles."
 Legislating freer competition is considered a natural complement to existing trade agreements, which have toughened up an economy that traditionally sheltered businesses from competition and let some become huge, inefficient monopolies.
 The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which covers world trade, and more recently, the North American Free Trade Agreement by Mexico, Canada and the United States, have opened an estimated 55 percent of the Mexican economy to a flood of international competition over the last decade. The law creating the commission in June 1993 envisioned covering areas of the economy not directly affected by the trade pacts, like telecommunications and transportation.
 Using wide-ranging powers granted by the new law, Santiago Levy, the president of the commission, is expected to see that Mexico operates as an essentially free and open market.
 "Mexico," said Mr. Levy, a bookish 38-year-old economist educated at Boston University, "is a country where, for 50 years, competition, monopoly and antitrust were just not household words. When the commission started, people only had rough notions of what competition really meant. Some came in and complained because a competitor was lowering prices. That says a lot about the competitive culture here."
 As Mr. Levy described it in a recent interview, the commission functions like the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, with judicial powers and investigative responsibilities. For the first year, Mr. Levy kept the commission deliberately low key, and he was not available for interviews until recently.
 "People here are not used to what antitrust is," he said. "It can easily be confused with an anti-business attitude."
 
Hoarding Bottles
 Mexican businesses were sometimes flustered by the very concept of competition. Consider the case of a Coca-Cola bottler in the northern city of Hermosillo who filed a complaint with the commission, asserting that the Pepsi-Cola bottler across town was engaging in illegal activity by collecting Coke bottles along with its own. The suit charged the bottler with hoarding his competitor's bottles in a storage yard and later destroying them.
 Mr. Levy said he thought he was on to something until he found out that the Coca-Cola bottler collected empty Pepsi bottles and held onto them, committing the same infraction as his competitor.
 The commission dismissed the suit.
 One of its earliest targets was the laundry industry. The laundry owners admitted that their board fixed prices for cleaning slacks or a shirt, but said they were following Government orders to control prices that dated back to a 1960 anti-inflation campaign.
 In another case, the commission fined five financial firms $800,000 for manipulating the auction of Mexican Treasury notes. According to the commission, the brokerage houses conspired not to bid above a certain level at the auction held by the Bank of Mexico, thus depressing prices.
 Felipe Presbitero, who heads the brokerage division of the National Association of Business Lawyers, would not comment on the merits of the case, but Francisco Velazquez Osuna, in charge of international businesses for the association, complained that the fines were too high.
 "We're not prepared for fines that strong," he said.
 The commission also went after Mexico's biggest company, the state-owned Pemex, whose oil monopoly is based on a clause in the nation's Constitution that leaves the Government in charge of strategic sectors of the economy. Pemex had interpreted this to cover the sale of gasoline. Mexico has fewer than 4,000 gas stations, each of which Pemex protects from local competition.
 
More Pumps Expected
Mr. Levy argued that the Constitution did not cover the sale of gasoline. Under a consent decree, Pemex has agreed to sell gasoline to anyone with municipal and environmental approval to build a station, regardless of how close the existing station is. Mr. Levy expects the number of gas stations to double in the next three or four years.
 The commission also has the power to intervene in the regulatory affairs of other Government agencies. In June, Mr. Levy got involved in one of Mexico's most important regulatory decisions in years, the opening of long-distance telephone service to competition in January 1997.
 In a nonbinding opinion, he took the freest market approach possible, advising that Telefonos de Mexico, the giant phone company and provider of most service in this country, face as much competition as possible.
 The commission's prestige was increased when the Communications and Transportation Ministry adopted most of its positions, although Telmex is known to have resented Mr. Levy's involvement.
The commission is expected to flourish under Mexico's President-elect, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, an economist and dedicated free marketeer. Mr. Levy says he does not expect the commission to expand its powers after Mr. Zedillo takes office on Dec. 1 but rather to consolidate the progress already made.
 Mr. Levy and the commission have been criticized for not going after giant companies like Televisa, the media conglomerate that dominates Mexican television. Some analysts also think he lacks independence because he works too closely with the Ministry of Commerce. Mr. Levy acknowledges that there have been shortcomings but, he said, Mexico has lived for more than half a century without real competition, and "you can't do everything in a year."

Though the panel has succeeded in loosening Pemex's grip as a supplier, its retail stations remain omnipresent.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN;
. . . And in Connecticut

 BODY:
GOVERNOR
 
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
 
WILLIAM E. CURRY JR., 42. State Comptroller since 1990, lawyer, served as a state senator from 1979 to 1983, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, former political director of Freeze Voter, the political arm of the Nuclear freeze movement. JOHN B. LARSON, 46. President pro tem of the State Senate since 1987, spent four years as a high school teacher, became president of an insurance agency in 1987, served on East Hartford school board and town council before being elected to the state Senate in 1983.,
 
THE ISSUES: The campaign has revolved largely around who would be a better manager. Mr. Larson, the party-endorsed candidate, cites his 11 years in the state Senate as proof of his leadership. Mr. Curry has blamed the Democratic establishment for the state's fiscal problems and says he would shake things up. Both share strong anti-crime positions and similar economic development strategies. The biggest difference is on tax cuts: Mr. Larson promises a $287 million reduction in the income tax; Mr. Curry has proposed a $1 billion cut in property taxes.
 
 ANALYSIS: Mr. Larson has run a high-profile television campaign. Mr. Curry has concentrated on building a field operation. While Mr. Larson's approach has given him greater name recognition, it remains to be seen what impact it will have in a primary, in which voter turnout is usually low and get-out-the-vote efforts are often critical.
 
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
 
JOHN G. ROWLAND, 37. Congressman from Waterbury 1985-91, barely lost the 1990 race for Governor, member of House Armed Services Committee. Since 1990 has been consultant for several military contractors based in Connecticut. PAULINE R. KEZER, 52. Former teacher, four-term state representative from Plainville. Lost race for Secretary of the State in 1986 but won in 1990, becoming the first Republican elected to a state office since 1970.
 
THE ISSUES: Mr. Rowland and Mrs. Kezer both want to stimulate the economy by cutting spending and taxes. Mr. Rowland promises to eliminate the income tax, Mrs. Kezer to cut the tax rate by 35 percent. Mr. Rowland wants to reduce the role of government in people's lives; Mrs. Kezer proposes to give voters a greater voice through referendums and initiatives.
 
ANALYSIS: Mrs. Kezer, a moderate, contends that Mr. Rowland is too conservative to win a general election. Criticizing his consulting business, she says he cannot speak for the state's workers after taking large fees from companies laying off thousands of workers. Mr. Rowland, endorsed by the convention, leads all candidates in polls and has raised eight times as much money as Mrs. Kezer. He says he is most in tune with the mood of voters, who he says are worried about the state's economy and about crime.
 
SENATE
 
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
 
GERALD LABRIOLA, 62. Retired pediatrician. Served one term in the State Senate, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1982, lost a party primary for governor in 1986. JOSEPH BENTIVEGNA, 38. Ophthalmologist, volunteer physician in Haiti for Sisters of Mother Teresa, former Republican Town Committee member in Rocky Hill. Has never run for public office.
 
THE ISSUES: Both candidates attack the Democratic incumbent, Joseph I. Lieberman, as a professional politician who is loyal to special interest. Both call for changing campaign-finance laws to limit the advantage of incumbents like Mr. Lieberman, who has raised more than 30 times as much money as the two men combined.
 
ANALYSIS: Neither man is well known or able to afford extensive advertising, so Mr. Labriola, the convention-endorsed candidate, should have an advantage in being on the same ballot line as Mr. Rowland. Mr. Labriola is respected within the party, but Mr. Bentivegna has attracted attention with brash, if sometimes unusual proposals that contradict conventional political wisdom. In early polls, Mr. Lieberman holds large leads over both men.
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
FIFTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
 
JAMES H. MALONEY, 45. Lawyer, State Senator from Danbury since 1986. As co-chairman of the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, wields great clout in the Legislature. Was a driving force behind a plan to overhaul the state property tax system. THOMAS S. LUBY, 42. Lawyer, Democratic majority leader in the State House of Representatives. A former Federal Prosecutor, he led a bipartisan coalition trying to reduce state spending. Wrote a state law making stalking a crime. Has represented Meriden in the House since 1986.
 
THE DISTRICT: The district is economically diverse, encompassing wealthy enclaves like Wilton and Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden. Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide.
 
THE ISSUE: The campaign has been bitter, with both candidates exchanging charges about tax deliquencies, lying and general unfitness for office. Both have pledged to work for tax cuts and economic development. Mr. Luby puts emphasis on crime and law enforcement. Mr. Maloney trumpets his record on environmental issues.
 
ANALYSIS: Mr. Maloney, endorsed by the party, has blamed Mr. Luby for this spring's lackluster legislative session, while taking credit himself for the bills that did pass. Mr. Luby appears to be relying on attacks -- about Mr. Maloney's character and failure to pay tax bills -- to overtake Mr. Maloney.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN;
The Primary: Highlights of Major Races in New York State. . .

 BODY:
GOVERNOR
 
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
 
MARIO M. CUOMO, 64. Governor since 1983. A lawyer, he was appointed Secretary of State by Gov. Hugh Carey in 1975. He lost to Edward I. Koch in the 1977 New York City mayoral race but was elected lieutenant governor with Mr. Carey in 1978. He has raised over $6 million for the campaign. LENORA B. FULANI, 44. A developmental psychologist in New York City and chairwoman of the New Alliance Party. Over the past 12 years she has run for New York City mayor, lieutenant governor, governor and President, never garnering more than 1 percent of the vote. She has raised more than $93,000.
 
THE ISSUES: At the heart of Ms. Fulani's campaign is the premise that she is an alternative to Mr. Cuomo. Beyond that, she has called for easier ballot access for statewide candidates, term limits for state officials, and initiative and referendum. Mr. Cuomo, who has largely ignored the primary challenge, supports improving ballot access, but opposes term limits and initiative and referendum, saying all those issues should be debated at a constitutional convention.
 
 ANALYSIS: Mr. Cuomo is expected to win big, but the question is how big. A less than overwhelming victory in the primary could signal trouble for November. Analysts also say the race will provide a measure of how well Mr. Cuomo is faring with black voters. Ms. Fulani, who is black, has campaigned heavily in black neighborhoods, while Mr. Cuomo is thought to have lost support among New York City blacks who blame him for Mayor David N. Dinkins's loss last year.
 
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
 
GEORGE E. PATAKI, 49. A State Senator from Putnam County. A lawyer, major of Peekskill from 1981, member of the state Assembly from 1985-91, when he was elected to the Senate. Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. He has raised more than $5.2 million. RICHARD M. ROSEBAUM, 63. A lawyer from Penfield, near Rochester, a member of the Monroe County Legislature from 1966-68, justice of the State Supreme Court from 1970-72. Appointed chairman of the state Republican Party of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1973, holding the position until 1977. Republican national committeeman from 1977-92. He has raised more than $2.2 million.
 
THE ISSUES: Mr. Rosenbaum, who won a place on the ballot by circulating petitions, has accused Mr. Pataki, the party's endorsed candidate, of being controlled by United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Though both men call themselves "pro-choice," Mr. Rosenbaum opposes any restrictions on abortion, while Mr. Pataki favors mandatory waiting periods, parental notification for minors and counseling for women seeking Medicaid-financed abortions.
 
ANALYSIS: Mr. Pataki, who has also been endorsed by the Conservative Party, is heavily favored because of his strong organizational support and because Republican primary voters are thought to favor more conservative candidates. Mr. Rosenbaum has a small organization, is widely identified with the party's more liberal Rockefeller wing and is depending on a final-week advertising blitz.
 
SENATE
 
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
 
DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, 67. Senator since 1977; cabinet or subcabinet member for four Presidents from Kennedy to Ford; Ambassador to India; Harvard Professor; author or editor of 16 books. Now chairman of Senate Finance Committee and one of the most powerful men in Washington. Has raised more than $3 million. AL SHARPTON, 39, preacher and street protester, ordained at age 10 by a Pentecostal minister in Brooklyn, active in civil rights causes for 20 years, former Federal informant. Made surprisingly strong run for Senate nomination two years ago. He has raised $88,079.
 
THE ISSUES: Mr. Moynihan, one of the most prolific writers and thinkers in American public life for more than a quarter century on issues from traffic safety to family stability, has also long been a lightning rod for controversy. Sometimes scorned by fellow Democrats as too conservative, never fully embraced by Republican administrations he served, his ideas defy easy classification. Since he warned of the collapose of the black family in the 1960's, he has had especially wary relations with black officials, who accused him of blaming the victim. Mr. Sharpton has sought to exploit such strains, and accused Mr. Moynihan of losing touch with the average voters.
 
ANALYSIS: Mr. Moynihan has held overwhelming leads in all polls to date, and Mr. Sharpton concedes he has virtually no chance of winning. But he hopes to use his candidacy in his continuing quest for political legitimacy. If he draws significant support from black voters, he will be a broker in statewide politics.
 
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
EIGHTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
 
JERROLD L. NADLER, 47. Incumbent, elected 1992; state assemblyman, 1976-92; graduate of Columbia College, Fordham Law School; advocate for rail freight. Raised on a poultry farm in New Jersey, cut political teeth protesting Vietnam war; lives on Upper West Side. Has raised more than $650,000. THOMAS K. DUANE, 39. City Councilman, elected 1991; former stockbroker, community board member, Democratic district leader and Manhattan coordinator for former City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman; graduate of Lehigh University, lives in Chelsea. Has raised more than $227,000.
 
THE DISTRICT: This district stretches from Grant's Tomb to Coney Island, encompassing neighborhoods on the Upper West Side that are among the most liberal in the nation and the conservative Satmar Hasidic enclave of Borough Park, Brooklyn. It is about 80 percent white, 9 percent black, 6 percent Asian, 12 percent are of Hispanic origin.
 
THE ISSUES: The candidates have tried to best each other for the title of most pure and liberal on a host of issues on which they would both be badly out of sync with much of the country, from gay rights (which both support) to the death penalty (which both oppose). Mr. Nadler has a strong record of support for gay rights, for example, but Mr. Duane who is openly gay and has the virus that causes AIDS, contends he could be a more effective advocate for those causes and others in a district with a substantial gay population.
 
ANALYSIS: Mr. Nadler is an accidental incumbent, having won the Democratic nomination that is tantamount to election here in a vote by the county Democratic Committee two years ago, after Representative Ted Weiss died on the eve of the primary. Mr. Duane has won early prominence in the Council and sought to challenge Mr. Nadler as too much of an insider, but the charge fell somewhat flat in light of Mr. Duane's own past as a district leader, and Mr. Nadler has significantly outpaced him in fundraising.
 
15TH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
 
CHARLES B. RANGEL, 64. Congressman, elected 1970, former state assemblyman, graduate of New York University and St. John's Law School. Lives in Harlem. Has raised nearly $1 million. ADAM CLAYTON POWELL 4TH, 32. City Councilman, elected 1991; graduate of Howard University and Fordham Law School. Lives in East Harlem. Has failed to file contribution reports in violation of Federal law.
 
THE DISTRICT: The heart of Harlem, one of the spiritual and intellectual centers of black urban America, but suffering from decades of poverty and crime. It is 47 percent black, 14 percent white, and 45 percent of Hispanic origin.
 
THE ISSUES: Mr. Powell, the son of the legendary Congressman and minister whom Mr. Rangel defeated in 1970, argues that Mr. Rangel is old and out of touch with the needs of his district and has not managed to turn seniority in Congress into tangible rewards for Harlem. Mr. Rangel, one of the highest-ranking members of the House Ways and Means Committee, argues that he was a staunch advocate for the urban poor through two Republican Administrations and is now poised to deliver new benefits like Federal funds for economic development.
 
ANALYSIS: Mr. Powell, whose mother is Puerto Rican, has traded on his family name and a face eerily like his father's to appeal both to older voters' nostalgia and to anti-incumbent sentiment among younger black and Hispanic residents. But he has won virtually no support from established politicians or community leaders, and Mr. Rangel argues that it would be foolhardy to turn him out of office now that he has gained legislative power.
 
17TH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 47. Congressman, elected in 1988. Former state assemblyman, teacher, guidance counselor; graduate of Lehman College and New York Law School, member of Education and Labor Committee. Apartment in Co-Op City. WILLIE COLON, 44. International salsa music star, bandleader, and community advocate, making initial foray into elective politics.
 
THE DISTRICT: One of the most diverse districts in the nation. Blacks make up more than two-fifths of the district and are the largest single plurality, but non-Hispanic whites and people of Hispanic origin are just behind, with about one-third each.
 
THE ISSUES: Rather than disagreeing over substantive issues -- on which their liberal positions are quite similar -- the candidates have sparred over geography (Mr. Colon notes that Mr. Engel moved his family to suburban Maryland: Mr. Engel that Mr. Colon lives acorss the Westchester County Line) and ethnic succession (Mr. Colon contends it is time to have a representative of Hispanic origin).
 
ANALYSIS: Mr. Engel won this seat after the longtime incumbent, Representative Mario Biaggi, was convicted on corruption charges, and he comfortably staved off a comeback attempt by Mr. Biaggi two years ago. But the district's polyglot makeup is attractive to a minority candidate.
 
ATTORNEY GENERAL
 
THE CANDIDATES
 
KAREN S. BURNSTEIN, 52. Lawyer, resigned in April as judge in Brooklyn Family Court, a position she held since 1990. Elected state Senator in 1972 representing Long Island and southeastern Queens. Served as executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, president of the state Civil Service Commission and Auditor General of the City of New York. Will appear on general election ballot in November on Liberal Party line. CHARLES J. HYNES, 59. Lawyer, elected Brooklyn District Attorney in 1989. Began career as a Legal Aid lawyer in 1963, then became a prosecutor in Brooklyn, heading the rackets bureau in 1970. Served as special state prosecutor, starting in 1975, to prosecute Medicaid fraud cases. Served for two years as New York City Fire Commissioner. Named in 1987 as special state prosecutor investigating the slaying of Michael Griffith in Howard Beach. G. OLIVER KOPPEL, 53. Lawyer, appointed Attorney General by his colleagues in the New York State Legislature after Robert Abrams resigned in December. Elected in 1970 to the Assembly, representing the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Former partner in law firm, Koppell, Drachler & Lipofsky. ELIOT L. SPITZER, 35. Lawyer, former prosecutor in Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which he joined in 1985. Headed the office's labor racketeering unit. Served as counsel to the Governor's Commission on Youth Crime and Violence. Resigned this spring from the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where he had worked since 1992.
 
THE ISSUES: The four candidates are moderate to liberal Democrats from New York City who differ little on the major issues. The biggest exception is Mr. Spitzer's support of the death penalty, which the other three oppose. Thus, much of the debate has focused on the candidates qualifications and their view of the office's role in fighting crime. Mr. Hynes and Mr. Spitzer say the office should be redefined as the state's overseer of criminal justice issues. Mr. Koppell and Ms. Burstein do not discount such a role, but say the other two are pandering because the office traditionally focuses on other duties: defending state agencies, consumer affairs, the environment and civil rights.
 
ANALYSIS: Polls show the race is far too close to call. Mr. Koppell, who received the blessing of the Democratic convention, is considered to have an edge on traditional organizational support. Ms. Burstein is the only woman and is considered the most progressive in a primary with a heavy female turnout and where the party's more liberal wing turns out. Mr. Hynes is considered to have a lock on Brooklyn, a plus because the New York City vote is so important. Mr. Spitzer is a long shot, but his support of the death penalty might play well upstate and among more conservative Democrats. Moreover, he has had the most consistent presence on television and could capitalize on any anti-politician sentiment.

After nine days of arguing about sexuality and morals, the United Nations population conference ended today with a broad endorsement of a new strategy for stabilizing the world's population, mainly by giving women more control over their lives.
The 20-year "program of action" drew unexpected if limited support from the Vatican, which fought a rear-guard campaign throughout the conference against any language suggesting that an abortion could be safe or legal. 
 At the conference's closing session, many Muslim and Latin American nations joined the Vatican in registering formal objections to the program's acknowledgment of legal abortion as part of health care or to language suggesting approval of sexual relations outside of marriage, particularly among adolescents.
But the 113-page declaration approved today enshrined for the first time a new concept of population policy that goes beyond traditional family planning to areas like reproductive health care, enabling women to make their own choices and promoting equality between the sexes.
 
Choices on Family Planning
 Apart from supplying contraceptives, governments and donors will be urged to insure education for girls and provide women with a range of choices on family planning and health care. In countries where abortion is not against the law, the declaration implies that health care embraces safe conditions for abortion.
The last United Nations population gathering, in 1984 in Mexico City, alluded to abortion only once -- to exclude it from its catalogue of family planning methods. At the previous conference in 1974 in Bucharest, abortion was not mentioned at all.
The Vatican withheld its assent to the conclusions of both previous population conferences. This time, said the Vatican's delegate, Archbishop Renato Martino, the Holy See wanted "to associate itself with the consensus, even if in an incomplete, or partial manner" because the plan "opens up some new paths."
 
Vatican Backs Parts of Text
 To loud applause from delegates from some 150 nations, the Archbishop said the Vatican endorsed the declaration's principles, as well as chapters on the family as "the basic unit of society," on stimulating economic growth, on "gender equality, equity and the empowerment of women" and on migration.
But the Vatican made clear that its shift today did not mean that its most fundamental views had changed. "Nothing is to be understood to imply that the Holy See endorses abortion or has in any way changed its moral position concerning abortion," Archbishop Martino said. Nor has it changed its opposition to contraceptives or sterilization, he said, or to the use of condoms in AIDS prevention programs.
Looking back on their torturous negotiations, many diplomats hailed the outcome as a triumph of patience over preconceptions.
"This is an historic document, unlike anything that's ever been drafted before," said the head of the United States delegation, Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs. "We took on a very difficult issue and accomplished a remarkable consensus on that issue."
The aim of the declaration is to stabilize the world's population at about 7.27 billion by the year 2015 -- compared to 5.67 billion today -- and avoid an explosion that could put the world's population at 12.5 billion in the year 2050.
The document foresees a three-fold rise in the amount the world spends annually on population stabilization, from around $5 billion today to about $17 billion by 2000.
At several points in the nine-day conference, delegates labored over minute compromise language only to find their efforts undone or sidetracked by moral arguments from the Vatican or from Muslim countries, mainly Egypt, Iran and Pakistan. Saudi Arabia and the Sudan boycotted the conference.
 
Reservations on Language
 Of more than 150 delegations attending, about 20 registered reservations to language on sex and abortion as the conference closed. The final declaration is not binding on governments, and clauses specify that it does not take precedence over national laws or religious beliefs.
The answer to the question of who won and who lost was ambiguous.
The Vatican claimed a victory in shaping the language of the text so that it did not enshrine any universal right to abortion and excluded abortion as a means of family planning. "The overall effect has been to swing the consensus in a direction it was not going to take," a senior Vatican delegate said.
Yet the fact that abortion was so widely discussed, and acknowledged as a crucial issue in women's health care, represented a defeat for anti-abortion forces and undermined the Vatican's crusade against the practice.
 
A Shift by Vatican
 The Vatican's decision to approve parts of the population document after formally withholding its assent at the previous two conferences seemed to reflect a growing concern about being isolated in the looming population debate.
"They know they have lost more than they have gained and that they need to start building bridges if they are to maintain any sort of voice in the U.N. in the future," said Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, referring to the Vatican.
Susan Davies, executive director of the Women's Environment and Development Organization in New York, said the most important achievement was that the declaration "gives primacy to women to control their own body and this is huge breakthrough."
Underlying the maneuvering was the question of financing the plan of action. Some delegates left the gathering saying that the plan would be viable only if spending were realigned among the donor and recipient countries, an issue that is to be discussed at a United Nations gathering in Copenhagen next year.
Delegates to that conference are to discuss a proposal that developing countries spend 20 percent of their national budgets on social programs and donors spend 20 percent of their foreign aid on similar projects.
"It's the only proposal on the table which would generate the resources needed for the Cairo agenda," said Richard Jolly, the deputy executive director of Unicef, which supports the so-called 20-20 proposal.
"Without resources the Program of Action will remain a paper promise," said Nafis Sadik, the conference's secretary general.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Forces: Poorly Armed And Seasoned Only in Terror

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Supreme Commander of the Haitian military often comes to work at noon and leaves at 2 P.M.
The Haitian Navy has immaculate uniforms, but only one ship with working engines, although several others float. 
 The air force has two propeller planes; one can fly. It has several old helicopters, in pieces, but one newer helicopter is rumored to be working.
The army has six or seven artillery pieces, almost all of them rusted hulks that are fired only at ceremonies. It has six armored personnel carriers rigged with light machine guns, but not all are running. It has 7,000 soldiers in uniform, a bottomless supply of 150-proof rum, and a force of voodoo priests poised to turn their powers on any American invaders.
As Haiti readies itself for a possible American invasion, it does so without any recent experience in war or the modern-day means to conduct one. In recent history, Haiti's military has waged war only on the country's own defenseless people, controlling them with terror and violence.
It is inevitable that blood will be shed in any invasion. But few people here, not even Foreign Minister Charles David, one of the most hard-line leaders in the military Government, expect Haitian soldiers to hold out long if the United States sends in its better-armed, better-trained troops.
Mr. David and other Government officials portrayed Washington as victimizing a weak nation and preparing to shoot down valiant young men defending their homeland.
Leaders of the Haitian pro-democracy movement and people on the street say with contempt and conviction that the Haitian soldiers will not fight at all, but rather will leave their uniforms behind and hide.
"They will toss their rifles in the street," said a longtime supporter of Haiti's deposed and exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
"They are not afraid of women and children, they will shoot a man who is bound up like a pig, but they will not stand and fight," he said. "They dance and sing now and talk big, but when they hear, 'boom, boom . . .' " He wiggled two fingers to pantomime a man running away.
There is a precedent. In September 1993 a large ship was spotted north of Jeremie, on the northern coast of Haiti's southern peninsula. Word spread through the city that it was a warship, coming to kill the soldiers and reinstate Father Aristide, said a human rights worker who was in Jeremie at the time. Instead of going to the docks to confront the invaders, soldiers shed their uniforms and fled.
It turned out to be a merchant vessel. The soldiers collected their uniforms and resumed their posts to protect Haiti's coastline.
But in the event of an invasion United States officials do not count on a quick retreat and mass surrender, said Stanley Schrager, the United States Embassy spokesman.
He believes some of Haiti's soldiers will fight, as will the civilian gunmen loyal to the military Government, who are said to be the people responsible for the most deaths since the coup that toppled Father Aristide in September 1991.
Mr. Schrager and other United States officials say they hope the Haitian Army will turn on its generals. Mr. Schrager said that any invasion plans would provide for keeping the army intact after the invasion, but without its leaders and in a much less ominous role.
"Now the army is a police force," to control the people, he said. After the invasion, soldiers would be used to rebuild the country, which has suffered under the military Government and the economic embargo.
While Haitian leaders talked about preparations for war, there seemed to be no real preparation at all. Sources close to the Haitian military say there has been no repair work on guns or equipment in Port-au-Prince, where the commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, and the other military leaders have their headquarters.
Early this month the Haitian military blocked off some streets with sandbags, but the barricades were only two bags high, short enough for children to step over, and were later partly washed away by hard rains.
Last week some downtown streets were partly blocked with cement barricades, but not with anything a soldier could not run around or a tank drive over.
 
Training Is Rough
 The much talked about and photographed Haitian civilian militias, despite the efforts of their trainers to slap, kick and curse them into fighting shape, are not taken seriously by the United States officials because the army takes up their unloaded guns every day at the end of training.
Unless the invasion comes between 7 A.M. and 3 P.M., the militia will have to fight without weapons.
Instead, the Haitian military seems to be pouring its efforts into public relations. On Thursday, 3,000 to 4,000 people, most of them trucked in on huge flatbed trucks, were handed signs and sent to demonstrate in front of the United States Embassy.
The signs, bearing different slogans all in the same handwriting, warned that American blood would spill and called President Bill Clinton a warmonger and Father Aristide a pig thief.
Here and there in the crowd were young men known here as attaches who waved pistols in the air and swilled rum.
 
To Be Sorry, or Dead?
 They represent the greatest threat to the poor people in an invasion because they might turn their weapons on them. They are despised by the poor and have no future in a country governed by Father Aristide. "The most we can hope," said one Aristide supporter, is that they are running "too fast to shoot us."
The threat of invasion has brought the appearance of a strong nationalist movement to Haiti, but how deep the sentiment runs remains to be seen.
One recent night, in a bar in Petionville, a suburb of the capital, Mr. Schrager discussed the invasion with Carl Denis, a senior adviser to Emil Jonassaint, President of the de facto Government.
"If you invade," Mr. Denis said, "you will be sorry."
"And what will you be?" Mr. Schrager asked.
"We will be dead," Mr. Denis said.
"Well," said Mr. Schrager, "I'd rather be sorry than dead."

HEADLINE: Taming of Inflation Buoys Centrist in Brazil Polls

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
With Brazil's presidential election less than a month away, a pro-American centrist has surged ahead of a leftist candidate in all opinion polls tracking the race to determine who will lead Latin America's largest country to the end of the century.
Not even the surprise resignation of the Finance Minister last week has shaken the commanding lead that Fernando Henrique Cardoso has taken in recent weeks over his Socialist rival, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. 
 "Fernando Henrique's chances have fallen a bit," Carlos Augusto Montenegro, president of Ibope, a polling organization, said recently. "It's now only 98 percent certain that he will win the election."
 
Free-Market Policies Popular
 The election of Mr. Cardoso, 63, an urbane sociologist, would extend free-market policies that are bringing high growth, lower inflation and a surge of imports.
Argentina's Economy Minister, Domingo Cavallo, predicted that under Mr. Cardoso, Brazil's economic growth rate would jump from 4 percent this year to 7 and 8 percent a year through the end of the decade. He cited the success of the Real Plan, an inflation-fighting blueprint designed last spring by Mr. Cardoso and based on a new currency, the real.
"The election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the success of the Real Plan would be the best news of the decade for Latin America," Mr. Cavallo said last week.
The real, which replaced the cruzeiro real, is pegged to the dollar and backed by $42 billion in reserves and a precariously balanced budget.
Confident that Latin America's sleeping giant is awakening, foreigners, largely Americans, have pumped about $5 billion into Brazil's stock markets since January. Since July 1, the day the new currency was adopted, Sao Paulo's stock market index jumped 68 percent.
That includes a seven-point dip in trading last week as investors reacted to the uproar that cost Rubens Ricupero his job as Finance Minister. In a private conversation in a television studio, broadcast around the nation by accident, Mr. Ricupero implied that the Government manipulated economic statistics to favor the Cardoso candidacy.
 
Inflation Rate Slows
 But confidence was bolstered with the swearing in of Ciro Gomes, one of Brazil's most popular state governors, as Finance Minister. And new economic data indicate that Brazil's monthly inflation rate will be below 2 percent in September, far below June's rate of 45 percent.
Confronted with these economic shifts, an estimated 25 million of Brazil's 95 million voters have migrated to the candidacy of Mr. Cardoso, a Social Democrat, in six weeks, opinion polls show.
"I think Lula is going to lose," Francisco Weffort, a campaign coordinator for the Socialist candidate.
Mr. da Silva's collapse in the polls is attributed not only to the new currency and the anti-inflation plan, but also to near-universal opposition to him by Brazil's press and wide support for Mr. Cardoso from the political establishment.
"There is an obvious explanation," Mr. Weffort said of Mr. Cardoso's surge. "It's the success of the Real Plan. Since Governments in Brazil generally don't govern, the population gives them a great deal of credit when they take a few measures."
Recent polls by Ibope and two other organizations, Gallup and DataFolha, gave Mr. Cardoso a lead of 22 points.
"It's quite possible that Fernando Henrique will win on the first round," Walder de Goes, an independent political scientist, said. "Inflation in September will be less than 2 percent, so he will get a boost."
 
Majority of Votes Required
 If none of the 10 presidential candidates wins a majority of valid votes on Oct. 3, a runoff will be held on Nov. 15.
With the return of retail credit, sales of cars, televisions and stereos jumped almost 15 percent in August, compared with July. One supermarket chain said food sales had jumped by 25 percent in the same time.
"Prices are going down," Sueli Regina Coutinho da Silva, 25, a nanny, said with a touch of amazement in her voice. "Last week, my sister went shopping, and she bought more food for less money than before. My other sister bought a videocassette recorder on credit. She wanted to buy one for years."
Today, the political benefits of the Real Plan are being reaped by its author, Mr. Cardoso.
Active in national politics for 12 years, Mr. Cardoso served for most of the last decade as a senator from Sao Paulo State, Brazil's economic heartland. After President Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached in a corruption scandal, Mr. Cardoso joined the Government of President Itamar Franco in late 1992, serving first as Foreign Minister and then as Finance Minister.
"There is not really any other option out there," Mr. Montenegro, the polltaker, said of a crowded field in which no other candidate receives more than 5 percent of voter preferences. "And Lula has a high rejection rate -- about 40 percent."
Defenders of Mr. Cardoso say that Mr. da Silva had erred by using his free television time to attack the Real Plan, a program that wins public approval ratings of 80 percent.
 
'Always Against Something'
 "The Workers Party is always against something," said Bolivar Lamounier, a Cardoso adviser. Fernando Henrique offers hope. This country is crazy to see a light at the end of the tunnel."
Plumbing the public mood, pollsters say that Brazil's electorate is looking for a candidate with a capacity to change things.
"While Lula is on television shouting against the plan, Brazilians are looking for stability and tranquillity," Mr. Montenegro said. "Before, people said Fernando Henrique needs the real. Now they say the real needs Fernando Henrique as President."
In the 1989 presidential election, Mr. da Silva narrowly lost a runoff vote to Mr. Collor. Over the last year, Mr. da Silva campaigned largely unopposed, crisscrossing this vast country, methodically building support that registered as high as 42 percent in public opinion polls in May.
Marcos Antonio Coimbra, president of the Vox Populi polling group, said voters had initially been attracted to Mr. da Silva because of his humble origins as an assembly line worker whose family had fled a drought in Brazil's impoverished northeast.
But Mr. Coimbra also recalled: "One member of a focus group in the northeast said on Monday: 'I don't want someone who loves me. I want someone who can solve my problems.' "

HEADLINE: Dole Explains Trade Treaty Stand

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, said today that contrary to some earlier signals he had given, he was not unalterably opposed to passing the new global trade treaty this year.
But Congress has a limited amount of time before it recesses for the November elections, Mr. Dole said, and the Clinton Administration may have to choose between the trade accord worked out by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its other priorities like health care and campaign finance reform. 
 "What the White House has to determine is that we are going to be here only a few more weeks before recess," Mr. Dole said in an interview. "We can't do everything. We would like to have a list of priorities. What is it? Health care, Superfund, campaign finance reform, gifts, lobbying or GATT?"
 
Article in Wichita Paper
 On Aug. 28, The Wichita Eagle, a newspaper in his Kansas constituency, published an article by Senator Dole suggesting that the Administration and Congress take their time in approving the 117-nation global trade accord, which lowers tariffs on manufactured goods by 30 percent and is expected to stimulate billions of dollars in new commerce. Mr. Dole said his constituents had a lot of worries about how GATT, as the treaty is called, would affect them.
Senator Dole's article stunned the Administration and many in the business community. The global trade agreement is popular with businessmen who form a big bloc of the Republican Party. Senator Dole was inundated with calls from the Business Roundtable, a group of prominent corporate chiefs, and with questions from reporters asking why he would join forces with the unlikely coalition of treaty opponents, including Ralph Nader, Patrick Buchanan and Rush Limbaugh.
This afternoon the Kansas Republican made clear that he was not leading a crusade to hold up the global trade accord. But Mr. Dole said he still wanted his concerns addressed, including the content of the agreement, how it would be paid and how it relates to other pending legislation from President Clinton.
Mr. Dole met this afternoon with the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who said Mr. Dole was being quite cooperative in the efforts now under way to move the trade accord through the various conference committees.
 
Thinks It's 'Doable'
 "I have not been around trying to hustle opposition to the GATT treaty," Senator Dole said in the interview. "I think a trade agreement is doable this year. But the Administration will really have to hustle and clear the decks."
He continued: "The bottom line is that we think there are some serious concerns, but I hope we can resolve them. We are not playing games. This is important and we hope we can get it resolved. But as part of that you have to tell us, Mr. President, what do you want to do this year?"
Senator Moynihan said he too would like to see GATT become the priority now for the Administration, but not necessarily at the expense of health care. "I would assume that GATT would be the Administration's first priority," Mr. Moynihan said, "but if we can do some health care legislation simultaneously, that would be fine."
In an effort to clear away some of the political obstacles to GATT, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, who is spearheading the Administration's effort to win approval for the global trade accord, met with Senator Moynihan and Senator Dole to inform them that the White House was setting aside its proposal to include in the GATT bill an extension of its "fast track" authority to negotiate future trade agreements.
Fast-track authority, which expired Dec. 15, 1993, enables the President to submit any trade accord to the House and Senate for a single vote in each chamber with no amendments allowed. That authority is considered essential to ward off special interest amendments that could doom a trade agreement.
 
Passage Not Assured
 But many lawmakers did not want to vote on it before the midterm elections because labor unions and big business were sharply divided on the fast-track issue and the politicians did not want to choose between them. The White House calculated that it was better to get GATT passed now and worry about fast track later.
Even with fast track now set aside until next year, passage of GATT is not assured. Because GATT entails tax adjustments, it will require 60 votes in the Senate to pass. That means it will need the help of the Republicans, and Senator Dole, as minority leader, needs to be on board.
"We have always had a bipartisan trade policy," Mr. Dole said today. "We have always been able to work out differences, but we are not there yet."
Mr. Dole's critics contend that he is engaged in some dangerously cynical politics by trying to deny President Clinton a major victory in the foreign policy area where he has been most successful: foreign trade.
"I do worry that if Bob Dole's threat proves real, and the Congress fails to enact the GATT agreement this time, you open up the possibility of its unraveling in other parts of the world as well," said Thomas Mann, a Congressional expert at the Democratic-leaning Brookings Institution. "That could put a chill on the global economic recovery. If that happens it would be an act of total recklessness on Dole's part."
But Mr. Dole's supporters say that he is engaged in some rather sophisticated politics by threatening to hold up the trade accord in order to win concessions from the Senate Democratic leader, George Mitchell of Maine, on health care and other pending legislation, while letting everyone know that at the end of the day he will support GATT.
"Somehow you have to get the message across that we have to be talked to," Mr. Dole said today. "Two can play that game."
Some of his Republican colleagues say that Senator Dole, who is a Presidential hopeful for 1996, is also reacting to the fact that his main Senate rival for the party leadership, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, has come out for a go-slow approach on GATT.

HEADLINE: Amid Ivy, Dinkins In New Role

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Like any other university professor facing his first class of the semester, former Mayor David N. Dinkins chose to open his lecture at Columbia University with a bit of levity.
"To those of you who voted for me this fall, I thank you," he told the 150 students sitting in Room A of Jerome L. Greene Hall. "And if you didn't vote for me, thanks anyway. That's how I got to be here." 
 Mr. Dinkins -- or Professor Dinkins, as some of those at Columbia might now call him -- has traded his Mayor's gavel for a lectern at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs.
He was appointed a professor in January, after he lost a re-election bid against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani by more than 50,000 votes. Mr. Dinkins said he is neither bitter about his loss, nor plans to drop out of the political or public policy arena altogether.
 
'A Worthwhile Pursuit'
 With his new job, Mr. Dinkins said he wants to show that those who no longer govern can still teach.
"I want to share with my students some of my experiences in public life and my quarter-century in politics," he said before the class began. "Among the things I want to do is to persuade young people that involvement in public service is a worthwhile pursuit."
His course, called Critical Issues in Urban Public Policy, will examine the relationship between politics and public policy. In the course, Mr. Dinkins plans to talk about race relations, and about how special interest groups and the media influence public policy.
So for now, besides trading notes with political cronies -- it is, after all, the political season in New York -- Mr. Dinkins has been talking pedagogy with Raymond W. Kelly, the former city police commissioner, who has also entered academia with a class in criminal science at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service of New York University.
The two are in a small club of former politicians and top government officials who are now part of the city's ivy league.
Another former mayor, Edward I. Koch, is a lecturer, also at the Wagner School.
City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who before his election last fall was a tenured professor at Queens College, is now teaching a course in government at Columbia's School of International Affairs.
During his first lecture, Mr. Dinkins, dressed in a navy blue double breasted blazer, stood confidently and talked easily with his students as he referred to written notes.
To begin the discussion, he read them this description of New York City:
"Two or three murders take place each day, before breakfast. You risk your life by walking the streets late at night. Homeless people lie in the gutters. Prostitution runs rampant and policemen are corrupt. There are useless expenditures of public money, overtaxation and improper contracting. The streets are filthy and in disrepair and filled with drivers reckless of human life.
"There is inadequate health care and TB has reached epidemic proportions and illegal immigrants are entering from ships onto our shores."
Mr. Dinkins then told them he was reading a description of the city from 1856. The students chuckled.
 
The Problems Stay the Same
 "So what I'm saying is that mayors and elected officials come and go and the underlying perceptions of our city's major problems seem to remain the same," he said. "These are the challenges that face politicians and policy makers throughout the years and in cities other than New York."
During the semester, he said, he would bring speakers from inside and outside government to address the topic of how policy makers respond to these problems or prevent them in the first place.
After the class, one student, Cenk Uygur, said he thought Mr. Dinkins would provide valuable lessons to students like himself who plan to go into politics.
"It's good to get it from the horse's mouth, I guess," said Mr. Uygur, a third-year law student. "When I heard that he was going to come here, I knew right off the bat that I wanted to take his class."
"In law school, we're always talking in niceties about what's best for a situation -- economically, politically and socially," Mr. Uygur said. "He's going to give us a sense of what can really be done and what's practical and realistic."
 
Boards of Directors
 In addition to teaching, Mr. Dinkins is serving on four corporate boards, including the American Stock Exchange and New World Communications. He also hosts a call-in show on radio station WLIB-FM (107.5) twice a week with features political guests. This week it was Representative Charles B. Rangel.
But he said his favorite activities now that he is not in public office are those dealing with young people, and especially those that allow him the chance to encourage them to join public service.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Computing's Bold Alliance Falters

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 13

 BODY:
It was to be the alliance of former enemies, teaming up to conquer common foes.
At least that was the strategy three summers ago when I.B.M. and Apple Computer stunned their industry by announcing a joint plan to attack the domination of the personal computer industry by machines based on Intel chips and Microsoft software. Apple and I.B.M. called their planned weapon the Power PC, and to make sure they had sufficient firepower, they recruited the big chip maker Motorola Inc. to their team. 
 But recently, the I.B.M.-Apple alliance shows signs of running off track.
 
Mission Not Accomplished
 Although Apple has been selling a line of Power PC computers since March, and I.B.M. is expected to introduce its own version of a Power PC machine next month, the companies have wandered from their common mission: making Power PC a unified technology "platform" that would run both Apple and I.B.M. software interchangeably.
Executives at both companies declined to speak on the record about the troubled alliance. But they have confirmed privately in recent weeks that it may be years -- if ever -- before I.B.M. and Apple fulfill their promise of giving computer users, and the computer industry itself, a true alternative to the Intel-Microsoft standard that accounts for 85 percent of personal computers now in use.
Analysts see an opportunity squandered.
"This was the last hope to stop the Intel-Microsoft cartel, and it's not going to happen," said George Colony, president of Forrester Research, a computer industry consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
To be sure, the Power PC chips made by Motorola and I.B.M. are finding a market not only in Apple and I.B.M. machines, but also in other types of consumer electronics. The video-game system maker 3DO, for example, recently announced that it would base its next generation of systems on the Power PC.
Apple, meanwhile, says that it is still on pace to reach its goal of selling one million Power PC Macintosh computers by the end of the year. And I.B.M. has high hopes for the Power PC-based computers that may roll out as soon as October.
But at least initially these Apple and I.B.M. machines will use different software. And Taligent, the I.B.M.-Apple joint venture created to develop a common software operating system, has yet to finish the software tools that third-party software developers will need to create the applications -- word processors, spreadsheets and the like -- without which an operating system is useless.
In fact the two companies are so far apart that Apple has not yet disclosed whether it will include I.B.M. among the computer makers it allows to license Apple's new System 7.5 software operating system for the Power PC.
 
Updating an Old Product
 For its part, I.B.M. appears to be placing new emphasis on its OS/2 operating system. OS/2, around for years, has never had a big following. But I.B.M. has spent considerable time and money improving it lately, and next month the company plans to introduce an entirely new version that has drawn praise from the industry experts who have tested it.
At a computer conference here last week, Lee Reiswig, president of the I.B.M. personal software products division, said the company would spend as much as $500 million to market and advertise the new OS/2.
The initial versions of the new OS/2 will work only with personal computers using Intel chips. But within a year, I.B.M. expects to have a Power PC version of OS/2 ready. Until then, unless I.B.M. obtains a license for Apple's System 7.5 software, I.B.M.'s Power PC machines will run on the Microsoft Windows NT operating system or on I.B.M.'s version of the industry-standard Unix software used primarily by engineers, academicians and computer scientists.
It would seem, as a result, that not only have I.B.M. and Apple stopped cooperating on a common Power PC platform, but they may also eventually find themselves in direct competition, with incompatible versions of Power PC hardware and software.
 
Pessimist's View of Alliance
 The Apple-I.B.M. alliance is "brain dead," in the view of Stewart Alsop, editor of Infoworld, a personal computer industry news weekly. "There are billions of dollars sitting out there, as well as control of a huge industry, and they're giving it away" to Intel and Microsoft, he said.
Mr. Alsop wrote an Infoworld editorial last week, urging I.B.M. to delay introduction of its Power PC computers, contending that there would be so little distinctive software available that no one would buy them.
The ramifications go beyond market-share questions for I.B.M. and Apple alone. Unless it appears that a single Power PC chip "architecture" will be used on millions of computers, then the companies that produce applications software have little incentive to develop versions of their programs for the Power PC.
And only if software companies write applications for the Power PC, will other computer makers be likely to adopt the technology -- just as makers of I.B.M. PC "clones" a decade ago embraced the Intel chip.
 
Improbable Partners
 What went wrong between Apple and I.B.M.?
When the two companies announced their partnership in the summer of 1991, it struck many as an unlikely alliance. I.B.M., the leader in personal computers at the time but also dominant in mainframes, was a $64.7 billion behemoth so powerful that an Apple television commercial in 1984 compared the company to George Orwell's Big Brother.
Apple, which reveled in its free-wheeling Silicon Valley corporate culture, was only about one-tenth I.B.M.'s size but had ascended to No. 2 in the personal computer industry by making machines with easy-to-use software that was intentionally incompatible with the I.B.M. PC.
Despite the companies' differences, however, many industry experts saw the combination of Apple's software wizardry and I.B.M.'s hardware manufacturing prowess as an unbeatable combination.
The idea had emerged from the success I.B.M. was having in early 1991 with its new RS-6000 work station, a sophisticated computer for engineers and other "power users" that was based on a type of chip architecture known as RISC -- for reduced instruction set computing. One of I.B.M.'s designers of the RS-6000, Phil Hester, convinced Jack Kuehler, who was then I.B.M.'s president and vice chairman, that RISC chips could find success in other types of computers.
 
First Approaches
 Intel, then and now, has paid only minimal attention to RISC technology, choosing instead to concentrate on a more conventional approach to chip design. Sensing an opportunity to exploit this difference, Mr. Kuehler did something remarkable. He placed a telephone call to Michael Spindler, president of Apple Computer, the company that had based its business -- and very culture -- on producing personal computers that were nothing like the Intel-based I.B.M. PC.
Mr. Spindler was intrigued by the idea of creating a new generation of technology with I.B.M. But even more smitten was Apple's chairman at the time, John Sculley, a vaunted "visionary" who was quick to embrace new ideas and seized this one as a plan on which Apple could base its future.
Mr. Kuehler also brought into the fold George Fisher, who was chairman of Motorola, the company that produced the 68000 series of chips that powered the Apple Macintosh. On July 30, 1991, the three announced the alliance whose technology would come to be known as Power PC.
But between that date and the time the first Power PC machines reached the market last spring, there were big management changes at all three companies. The biggest shake-up was at I.B.M., whose chairman, John Akers, was forced out in favor of Louis V. Gerstner Jr. in April 1993. Mr. Kuehler retired soon after that.
Meanwhile, at Apple, where the board was concerned with the company's flattening revenues and slipping market share, Mr. Sculley was falling out of favor. He relinquished day-to-day operating responsibilities to Mr. Spindler in June 1993 and in October left the company altogether.
 
New Cast of Characters
 As a result, the main proponents of the Power PC have left the scene, replaced by executives with mandates from their boards to devise their own bold new strategies.
Even at Motorola, Mr. Fisher is no longer in place, having left the company last October to take on the challenge of rebuilding the Eastman Kodak Company. (As the chip-making member of the alliance, however, Motorola would seem to have every incentive to make the technology succeed and sell as many Power PC microprocessors as possible.)
Despite moving in divergent directions, I.B.M. and Apple are still holding talks aimed at putting the partnership back on course, executives at both companies say. But they decline to predict whether they can truly revive the grand alliance described to the world three summers ago.
In the view of some analysts, too much has changed since then.
"What customers want is a unified platform," said Daniel Farber, editor in chief of PC Week, a newspaper. "But it comes down to geopolitics. Apple is afraid of becoming a serf in I.B.M.'s feudal kingdom."

HEADLINE: Chairman of Goldman Will Retire

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stephen Friedman, the head of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the richest partnership on Wall Street, with more than $2 billion in profits last year, surprised the firm and much of the securities industry yesterday by saying that he would retire in November.
Mr. Friedman will be succeeded as senior partner and chairman of the management committee -- a post he has held for two years -- by Jon S. Corzine, 47, now co-head of Goldman, Sach's bond business. Henry M. Paulson Jr., who is 48 and co-head of the investment banking division, will assume the No. 2 job as vice chairman and chief operating officer. Both men were handpicked by Mr. Friedman. 
 Mr. Friedman is leaving at a time when Goldman, Sachs, like many other firms on Wall Street, is suffering a sharp drop in profits after several boom years. That fact, combined with the suddenness of the resignation, sparked speculation about his reasons for retiring, including illness and some dissent among the firm's partners.
But Mr. Friedman, who is 56, said his job was tiring. He said he had been hinting about retirement for months because he holds one of the more physically demanding jobs on Wall Street, with heavy foreign travel and round-the-clock management responsibilities.
He has been among the top three officers of Goldman, Sachs for more than a decade and presided over two record years of profits, 1992 and 1993. In a statement to employees yesterday, he said that "when the job is done with maximum intensity, it can be more than a little tiring."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Friedman said: "How come I'm doing this? Take a look at this view." He then fished out of his desk an eight-inch-wide snapshot of the snowcapped mountains taken from his "big cabin" in Jackson, Wyo. "Now take a look at that view," he said as he pointed out from his 22d-floor Wall Street office at the East River, blocked by other skyscrapers. "Which is better?"
He denied rumors of serious illness, and noted that he ran up to six miles a day. "But my health is great and that's how I want to keep it," he said. "Only on Wall Street do people think it bizarre that I don't want to spend half of my day on the telephone and the other half on an airplane."
Mr. Friedman is an intensely intellectual lawyer who joined Goldman, Sachs in 1966. He is leaving after helping expand an already rich and prestigious firm into a global investment powerhouse, with profits from investment banking, bond trading, and foreign exchange of more than $2.3 billion in the year that ended on Nov. 26.
But an unexpected rise in interest rates has hurt Wall Street and Goldman, Sachs, slicing the firm's profits this year and making inevitable huge cuts in the partners' bonuses, which are often the envy of Wall Street.
 
An Aloof Style
 Mr. Friedman's decision to leave comes amid reports of disaffection among some of the firm's 150 partners. Some say Mr. Friedman's aloof style does little to smooth the relations between the sometimes contentious factions within Goldman, Sachs.
"The word is that there was some unrest among his partners," said an executive recruiter who has regular contact with Wall Street brokerage firms. "I think you can take at face value that Friedman did a good job and that he is making a life decision. But he's probably getting out before it gets messy."
In response to the reports of disaffection at the firm, Mr. Friedman said, "I'm not going to tell you that all 150 partners are happy. And I've been described as aloof before. But we have had the most collegial management committee in my experience here. And it bothers me when someone outside of the firm says there's a mess here because there isn't."
Mr. Corzine, a member of the management committee, also denied the charges of disaffection, saying, "I wouldn't be jumping into a mess, willingly or unwillingly."
 
Legendary Profits
 While it is a private partnership that does not have to disclose its revenues and profits, the profits of Goldman, Sachs from selling bonds, arranging mergers and acquisitions, and buying and selling foreign currencies are often Wall Street legends.
Last year was an especially good year. Goldman reportedly had pretax profit of $2.3 billion in the year that ended on Nov. 26, a figure that Mr. Friedman and Mr. Corzine acknowledged. They would not comment on this year's figures, but pretax profit reportedly plunged 59 percent, to $450 million, in the first six months. Others say the profit is even lower.
"But all the firms on Wall Street are going through the same thing," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst who covers the brokerage business for Sanford C. Bernstein. "A top person leaving a firm is not going to leave because of the current environment."
Mr. Friedman has held both chairman and vice chairman positions since 1992, when Robert E. Rubin, the other co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, left to join the Clinton Administration as a senior economic adviser.
 
A Plan for Succession
 Mr. Friedman told the management committee last Wednesday of his decision to retire; the succession plan was made final on Sunday. He told a regularly scheduled partners' meeting on Monday of the move.
Before that, Robert J. Katz, the firm's chief counsel and a close friend, was apparently the only person in the firm who knew 1994 would be Mr. Friedman's last year.
A partner at the 4:30 P.M. partners' meeting on Monday recalled someone asking Mr. Friedman why he did not leave in 1993, when profits were at a record high, and Mr. Friedman replying, "I didn't see this year coming this way."
In the interview yesterday, Mr. Friedman said: "What I actually said was, 'I thought we were well on our way to our second record year.' And then I made a joke that I didn't see this year coming.' "
Mr. Corzine is seen as more open and personable than Mr. Friedman, whose hobbies include chess and long-distance running. Popular with clients, Mr. Corzine may be better able to rally the sometimes contentious egos in an organization at which hundreds in the firm are millionaires.
In Mr. Paulson, who is from the investment banking side, where mergers and acquisitions and other high-profile deals are struck, Mr. Corzine may find a simpatico partner. In interviews yesterday, they spoke warmly of working as a team.
Like Mr. Corzine and Mr. Friedman, Mr. Paulson jogs three or more miles a day. All three wear Timex Ironman digital watches (Mr. Paulson's was given to him by Mr. Friedman).

HEADLINE: Giuliani Cites Drop in Crime In Assessment

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
In an annual assesment of the government's performance, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday painted a statistical portrait of a city that has seen crime drop to its lowest rate in 15 years but still faces staggering social problems and service burdens, including a welfare roll that has climbed to its highest point in at least two decades.
The Mayor's Management Report also found dirtier streets, less inviting parks, skyrocketing overtime costs and increased waiting times for citizens pursuing taxi and consumer complaints, compared with the year before. 
 The report, a survey that has been issued yearly since the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, covered the fiscal year that ended on June 30, straddling the end of the Dinkins administration and the beginning of the Giuliani administration.
It did not fully reflect the new round of service and staffing cuts contained in the $31.6 billion budget that took effect in July.
"We're trying in every single circumstance to alleviate -- as much as we can -- the effects of the cuts," Mr. Giuliani said at a briefing on the report. "And if there are cuts in certain areas, those are the areas in which we seek private participation and are working very hard to do that or where we seek more state or Federal aid."
 
Success Stories
 Some city agencies had success stories: the Transportation Department reported that street conditions improved slightly, with 82.2 percent in good condition, up rom 80.2 percent a year ago. And Fire Department response time held steady or improved in every borough except the Bronx.
But in agency after agency, there were signs that city workers were staggering under new burdens resulting from the loss of workers to attrition and the city's severance program.
The Parks Department reported that the overall condition of small parks and playgrounds declined appreciably because of a shortage of supplies and reductions in staff available to perform repairs. In spring 1993, 51 were deemed acceptable; by last spring, 39 percent were considered acceptable.
 
Staff Vacancies
 Child-welfare caseworkers saw the number of new cases they received per month rise from 6.6 to 7.6 because attrition and severance cut the caseworker staff at field offices by 13 percent. And despite an increase in AIDS cases in the city, workers at the Health Department's AIDS hot line responded to 8,623 fewer calls because of staff vacancies.
The scofflaw tow program of the city sheriff's office brought in only $34 million in fines -- 46 percent less revenue than planned. The report cited a parking-violation amnesty program, the severe winter, staff vacancies and a law setting new standards for towing as factors in the drop.
Mr. Giuliani pointed to statistics on crime and jobs as evidence that his administration was affecting the climate of the city. "I think the two major areas that we wanted to make changes in, we've made them -- crime and the economy," Mr. Giuliani said.
Employment in the city grew by 21,100 jobs. And crime, continuing the trend of recent years, fell by 6 percent from the 1993 fiscal year to its lowest level in 15 years. Total arrests by the city's Police Department rose 4.4 percent to 198,067, but felony arrests were down 1 percent for the same period.
In an effort to highlight the police initiatives of his own administration, Mr. Giuliani included a separate comparison of the crime rates for the first six months of his term to the corresponding period in 1993, showing that total reported crimes fell by 9.7 percent, with 34 of the city's 75 police precincts reporting decreases of 10 percent or more.
City officials said that while the growth rate in welfare caseloads was slower than in the preceding year, the number of people on public assistance rose to 1.14 million -- the highest number in at least two decades.
 
Unemployment Rate
 Officials attributed the increase to a continuing high unemployment rate and to a rise in clients with AIDS-related illnesses. From January 1993 through last June, 8,114 new adult cases of AIDS were reported in the city. Officials linked more than half of the increase to a new definition of the disease by the Federal Government.
Reports of child abuse and neglect declined to under 50,000 for the first time since 1987, after years in which the crack epidemic helped make the caseloads escalate. The number of children in foster care also dropped for the third consecutive year, to 46,814 children.
Homeless families given shelter by the city increased slightly to an average of 5,599 families -- or 17,300 people -- a day. The city brought down the number of families living in hotels to 944. By June 1995, the city is required by law to eliminate the use of commercial hotels lacking private bathrooms and cooking facilities.
But to comply with state and court mandates to prevent families with children from sleeping overnight in emergency-assistance offices, the city recently resumed use of four commercial hotels, a move the report said was temporary.
 
New Approaches
 Peter J. Powers, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, said the city would put a number of new management approaches in place over the coming year to make the government more efficient. But one of the city's chronic management problems, high overtime costs, remained, with overtime rising by $75.3 million, to $521.2 million, in 11 major city agencies. The largest increase came in the Fire Department.
The management report by the Mayor is required to be issued each year under the City Charter. The Giuliani administration, in what it described as an effort to make the report more of a mangement tool assessing agency performance and less of a compendium of statistics, eliminated some of the data measured in the past.
The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, expressed concern about some of the missing data, including indicators measuring the Housing Preservation and Development Department's lead-abatement activities. And he said the Council would hold hearings on both the report's findings and its new format.

HEADLINE: Interstate-Banking Bill Gets Final Approval in Congress

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Senate overwhelmingly approved and sent to the President for signing today a bill that would allow banks to operate branches across the nation.
The interstate banking bill has been the Clinton Administration's top legislative priority in banking this year, and Congressional approval of it represents a victory for the President and for big banks that want to set up branch networks nationwide. The bill would eliminate the remaining barriers to interstate banking in a dozen states and a requirement that banks operate separate subsidiaries in each state. 
 Passage, on a 94-to-4 vote, came after the Treasury Department agreed this morning to a procedure for pursuing negligent insiders at failed savings and loan institutions.
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, had threatened a filibuster over a controversial provision in the bill that would have effectively limited Federal action against the officers, directors, lawyers and accountants of failed savings and loans. But he dropped his threat after the Office of Thrift Supervision, which is part of the Treasury Department, vowed to undertake what amounted to an end run around the provision.
The House had already approved the interstate banking bill. The four Democratic Senators who opposed the bill today were David L. Boren of Oklahoma, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin.
President Clinton welcomed the Senate action. "Today this country took an historic step -- one that has been delayed for much too long -- to help American banks better meet the needs of our people, our communities and our economy," he said.
The bill will make banking more convenient for Americans who live in one state and work in another. Under current law, for example, a customer of a bank branch in Connecticut typically cannot make a deposit at the same bank's New York branches. The interstate banking bill would eliminate this restriction, along with some of the large and duplicative bureaucracies that banks have established to operate separate subsidiaries in each state.
Smaller banks initially opposed the interstate banking bill. But their hostility weakened when the bill was drafted so that big banks are virtually required, at least for the next few years, to buy a bank in another state before opening branches there.
A conference of House and Senate lawmakers inserted the controversial savings and loan provision in late July. It effectively prevents two Federal agencies, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, from pursuing most civil cases against the insiders. The House and now the Senate have approved the bill with this provision.
 
 
Third Agency
 But under the procedure agreed upon today, a third agency not covered by the legislation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, told Congress that it would pursue the cases. The strategy does not require Congressional approval, Federal regulators said, because the agencies' budgets come from fees collected from the institutions they regulate, not money appropriated by Congress.
The new strategy came under immediate criticism from lawmakers who contend that the F.D.I.C. and R.T.C. have waged a costly vendetta against anybody with any link to the savings and loan collapse, which has cost taxpayers $200 billion.
"I personally think it's wrong for them to try this end run," said Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican who is a senior member of the House Banking Committee.
Lawyers for the directors and officers of failed savings and loans also reacted angrily today to the plan. They said Congress never intended for the Office of Thrift Supervision to play such a large role. "I think they lack the authority, and it will be litigated," said Ronald R. Glantz, a lawyer here who represents many people facing possible large fines.
Most of the Federal cases against savings and loan insiders are filed by the F.D.I.C., which regulates state-chartered savings and loan associations, and the R.T.C., which disposes of failed savings and loans.
 
 
Payment Plan
 Under today's plan, they would pay the thrift office to file some of these cases for them. The thrift office would then transfer back to the F.D.I.C. or the R.T.C. any money that it won in the lawsuits.
Federal courts have ruled in the last year that state statutes of limitation run out quickly for cases filed by the F.D.I.C. and the R.T.C. But the Office of Thrift Supervision is covered only by Federal statutes of limitation, which run longer.
A provision added to the interstate banking bill in the House-Senate conference in late July would extend the state statutes of limitation for cases of fraud and willful misconduct at savings and loan institutions, but not for cases involving negligence and gross negligence, the charges in more than four-fifths of all cases. Federal regulators criticized the statute of limitations provision in the interstate banking bill as worse than nothing.
Jonathan L. Fiechter, the acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, sent a letter today to several senators describing the agency's new plans. While the thrift office has already begun fighting two other cases on behalf of the F.D.I.C., Mr. Fiechter said that it would try to negotiate a memorandum of understanding with the R.T.C. and the F.D.I.C. to pursue such a course more broadly.
 
 
'Reversal of Their Fortunes'
 The letter, a remarkable shift that the thrift office had long resisted, came after Mr. Metzenbaum threatened on Friday to filibuster the entire bill because of the savings and loan provision.
A senior F.D.I.C. official expressed delight at the outcome. "I think the directors and officers out there will definitely see this as a reversal of their fortunes," said the official, who requested anonymity.
But the thrift office's enthusiasm for pursuing savings and loan wrongdoers remains unclear. The office announced in April that it would begin focusing on regulating the nation's remaining savings and loan institutions and, "will rely increasingly on the R.T.C. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to seek restitution from wrongdoers associated with failed thrifts turned over to those agencies by O.T.S."
Carolyn Lieberman, the acting chief counsel of the thrift office, said in an interview today that the agency had not actually reversed its policy and that any shift today involved "shades of emphasis." She also said that while the thrift office could probably pursue R.T.C. and F.D.I.C. cases involving gross negligence, the thrift office's legal standard for pursuing litigation typically called for more wrongdoing than the basic negligence cases filed by the other two agencies.
The interstate banking bill is formally known as the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, after two lawmakers who are retiring from Congress this year: Senator Donald Riegle, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Stephen L. Neal, the North Carolina Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee's panel on financial institutions. Banking lobbyists, led by officials of Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., have made interstate banking their top priority since the mid-1980's.
Hugh L. McColl Jr., the chief executive of Nationsbank, sat with President Clinton in Charlotte last spring when the Arkansas Razorbacks won the national collegiate basketball championship.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rise in Treasury Prices Is First in Two Weeks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday for the first time in nearly two weeks following a Government report indicating that inflation remained subdued.
The Treasury's 30 1/4-year bond rose 12/32 , or $3.75 per $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 7.68 percent from Monday's two-month high of 7.71 percent. 
 After jumping in early trading, bonds fell as much as a quarter-point before rising again in late trading.
The midday weakness reflected traders' concerns that rising producer prices have not yet worked their way through to the consumer level. But as prices began to recover, the bond market gained support from short-sellers covering their positions.
Even so, "the market's not going to get too excited until it sees some more economic numbers," said Joseph Bench, a money manager at New Castle Advisors in White Plains. "We've got a lot of indicators coming out this week, all of which are going to keep the market under pressure."
Bonds rose early in the day after the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in August, below Wall Street's expectations for four-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Growth Is Seen Slowing
 The bond market found another sign that growth was slowing in a report from the Johnson Redbook service, showing that sales at department and chain stores rose 4.2 percent, less than expected.
Bond traders are looking to today's Government report on August retail sales for further hints of inflation. In a survey, analysts predicted sales would show an increase of 1.1 percent.
The rise in the August Consumer Price Index was less than the six-tenths of 1 percent increase in August producer prices. When the Producer Price Index was released Friday, bonds plunged on inflation fears.
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index is running at a 2.9 percent annual rate through August, compared with 2.8 percent during the first eight months of 1993 and 2.7 percent for all of last year.
Yesteray's report "isn't going to remove inflation fears," said Stephen Gallagher, an economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company. "It's still around."
Yields on intermediate- and short-term Treasury issues also declined yesterday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note yield was 6.32 percent, down from 6.35 percent on Monday.
Some analysts said the Federal Reserve would not necessarily hold off on its sixth rate increase this year just because the increase in the Consumer Price Index was less than expected.
"With the economy growing, the Fed has to continue to be nervous," said Steven Wood, director of financial markets research at BA Securities Inc. in San Francisco. "The best they can say is that they dodged a bullet."
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, insisted yesterday that inflation was not "getting out of control." Asked whether the Fed would raise rates again this year, he replied, "I don't know."
Glenn Switzer, a senior investment officer at J & W Seligman & Company in New York, said the Consumer Price Index. might not yet reflect rising prices at the wholesale leve. "It was really more backward looking, and more a reflection that it's difficult to pass on price increases," he said.
"I want to see more early evidence of inflation abating before I'd be more relaxed," Mr. Switzer added, citing commodity prices or prices paid by purchasing managers.
Until those prices drop, "the C.P.I. is not going to have much weight in changing people's minds" about faster inflation, he said.
Still, some investors said they were not deterred by the prospect of higher interest rates.
"Real yields are high by historical standards," said Matthew Gelfand, a senior investment officer at Strategic Investment Partners in Arlington, Va., which has $1.2 billion in United States Government debt. "The higher they go, the more attractive they look. In the long run, we're rewarded."
Bonds also got a lift yesteray from speculation the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes for another nation's central bank, said Chris Madell, head trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. The Fed declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Eased Fear of Inflation Sends Stocks Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks climbed yesterday as concern about inflation eased when the Government said consumer prices in August rose less than economists had expected.
Technology stocks were among those making the largest gains amid stronger than expected orders for semiconductors last month. 
 "A good rally in the techs does tend to carry the market with it," said Bill Allyn, managing director at Jefferies & Company in Short Hills, N.J. "The market is in good shape. Business is strong," and third-quarter earnings are likely to show large gains compared with last year, he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average increased 19.52 points, to 3,879.86, on gains by International Paper, the Aluminum Company of America and I.B.M.
The ratio of advancing stocks to those declining on the New York Stock Exchange was nearly 11 to 10. Volume grew to 295.7 million shares, from 244.7 million on Monday.
In measures of the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500 climbed 1.31, to 467.52, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.82, to 765.83. Many technology issues are traded on Nasdaq.
Among the more visible tech stocks, Intel rose 3/4 to 65 1/4; LSI Logic jumped 1 1/8, to 32 3/4; Texas Instruments surged 1, to 75 1/8; Motorola jumped 3/4, to 53 1/8 and Advanced Micro Devices rose 7/8, to 28 3/8.
Stock prices increased after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices had risen by three-tenths of 1 percent in August, a little below the four-tenths of 1 percent expected. The underlying rate, excluding food and energy, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent, matching forecasts.
 
Optimism on Interest Rates
 The Consumer Price Index report supported the idea that the Federal Reserve, "in all likelihood, won't do anything until after the election in November" to raise interest rates, said Joseph DeMarco, head of equity trading at HSBC Asset Management.
"People can at least be comfortable with that notion," Mr. DeMarco said.
Looking ahead, "the line of least resistance for the market is higher," he continued. "If we can get the leadership out of the technologies, which typically lead the market, it'll be a decent move."
In reaction to yesterday's inflation report, and to remarks by Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, that inflation was not rising out of control, yields on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell to 7.68 percent, from 7.71 percent at Monday's close.
The consumer price report "stabilizes the market and takes out the fear factor" about a buildup in inflation, said Jack Baker, managing director for stock trading at Furman Selz.
Among other issues, General Datacomm Industries soared 4 1/8, to 28. The telecommunications-equipment company will supply Ameritech with switches for a new high-speed network service. Ameritech rose 1/8, to 41 1/4.
Monsanto jumped 4 1/4, to 84 1/2. The chemical company said its chief executive, Richard J. Mahoney, would retire in March and that its president, Robert B. Shapiro, would succeed him.
Timberland plunged 7 1/4, to 38 3/4. Merrill Lynch cut its 1994 earnings estimate for the maker of shoes and hiking boots to a range of $2.30 to $2.40 a share, from $2.40 to $2.60.
United American Healthcare rose 1 7/8, to 23 1/8. The health maintenance organization earned 38 cents a share in the quarter ending on June 30, up from 23 cents a year ago.
Vermont Teddy Bear surged 1 1/4, to 6 1/4. The retailer of teddy bears said it had reached an agreement with Viacom Consumer Products to market New York City Marathon bears for the New York Road Runners Club.
Western Company of North America spurted 4 1/2, to 16 3/4. The provider of services to the oil and gas industries said BJ Services had offered to buy the company for $450 million, or $18.50 a share. BJ Services rose 1 1/4, to 20 1/8.
Adobe Systems rose 1 7/8, to 32 7/8. The software company and Apple Computer signed an agreement to include's Adobe's Acrobat Reader 2.0 software with selected Macintosh systems by the end of the year. Apple added 1/16 , to 3513/16 .

HEADLINE: Japan Hardens Stand on Trade Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 13

 BODY:
With a deadline looming in less than three weeks, Japanese Government officials toughened their position today on trade talks with the United States, saying that the prospect of a full resolution of the issues was impossible and that at best they might arrange a partial deal.
"At present, there are no prospects" for a deal on all the markets being discussed, said Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister for International Trade and Industry. Instead, he said, the two sides would have to settle for a partial deal, something the United States has only reluctantly said it would consider. 
 In a further tightening, another senior Japanese Government official changed gears on a concession that had been offered earlier, saying that a big Japanese Government loan being negotiated with the Ford Motor Company was contingent on eased demands by the Clinton Administration over opening the Japanese auto market.
 
Broader Deal Demanded
 Japan's Export-Import Bank has said it is negotiating a loan of $200 million to $300 million to help Ford produce right-hand-drive automobiles for export to Japan. The loan's concessionary interest rate would have saved Ford millions of dollars in interest costs. The bank has said it is willing to offer similar loans to Chrysler and General Motors.
Today, the senior Government official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified further, said that the loans would not be made if Washington did not strike a broader deal on autos by relaxing its demands.
The comments underscored the fact that the loan was motivated for political rather than economic reasons, and demonstrated how the Japanese Government has been increasingly eager to use financial incentives to put pressure on the United States.
The official also hinted that if the United States sought to weaken the dollar further against the yen, Japanese financial institutions might sell some of their holdings of United States Treasury bonds, thus driving American interest rates higher.
The comments today were part of a vigorous campaign by the Japanese to press the United States to ease its demands on the trade issues being discussed. They face a Sept. 30 deadline for several of the key markets.
For nearly a year and a half, the two sides have been unable to agree on measures to open the Japanese markets for insurance, autos and auto parts, government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment.
The main hurdle has been an American demand that Japan provide guarantees of increased purchases of American goods or improved access to the Japanese market.
Even though the Japanese agreed in the original framework for the current talks to include such "objective criteria" for measuring progress, they now say they have no intention of making such a concession because it would require Government intervention in the markets.
 
U.S. Backing Away?
 Mr. Hashimoto contended that the United States was already backing away from its demands and had softened its earlier insistence that it would reject a partial agreement. He said today that he had suggested the two sides agree only on "what could be wrapped up."
Although American officials have reluctantly admitted for several months that they would be forced to accept such a deal, Mr. Hashimoto said that during talks with top American officials last week in the United States they had given ground.
"But my impression was that the U.S. has finally shown understanding," he remarked.
Other officials have said that a deal on autos and auto parts appears remote, but that an agreement on opening Japan's insurance market and government procurement was within reach.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Little Change On Consumer Price Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday, after a Government report showing a tepid rise in consumer prices eased some investors' concern about inflation.
The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, soared to its highest point against the United States currency in more than six months, after the Parti Quebecois won provincial elections in Quebec by a narrow margin. The results prompted speculation that the separatists did not have enough support for Quebec to secede from Canada. 
 In New York, the dollar was last quoted at 1.5435 German marks, little changed from 1.5436 marks on Monday. It slipped to 98.85 Japanese yen, from 99.18 yen.
The Canadian dollar rose to 74.18 cents (United States), its highest level since Feb. 28, and up from 73.13 cents.
The dollar was initially pulled higher by the rise in Treasury bonds, after the Labor Department said consumer prices rose a smaller-than-expected three-tenths of 1 percent in August.
Bonds and the dollar seesawed for the rest of the day. There was speculation that other economic reports due out shortly would show that the economy was growing fast enough to set off an acceleration of inflation.
"The number was a relief," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank. "But reports due out later this week are expected to show strength. There's going to be more anxiety about inflation."
Traders warned that bonds and the dollar could fall today if the Government report on retail sales for August came in stronger than expected. In a survey, analysts estimated that retail sales rose 1.1 percent in August as auto sales rebounded.
Bonds and the dollar plunged on Friday after the Labor Department reported that producer prices rose six-tenths of 1 percent in August, the biggest increase in almost four years.
Canada's currency rallied along with Canadian stocks and bonds because the Parti Quebecois's narrow margin of victory raised doubt about the willingness of Quebec's voters to secede from Canada.
"Secession looks more remote now," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange trading at the Bank of Montreal in New York. "Investors are comfortable with Canadian assets today."
Canada's central bank sold the country's currency yesterday to slow its rise, traders said.
Elsewhere, the British pound slipped yesterday to $1.5637 from $1.5693, after surging on Monday after the Bank of England raised interest rates.

HEADLINE: Angell Said To See Slump

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
A former governor of the Federal Reserve, Wayne D. Angell, expects the economy to fall into recession in 1996 as the Fed fights inflation with higher interest rates, those who heard him on a conference call said yesterday.
The former Fed official, now chief economist at the Bear Stearns Companies, made the remarks in a conference call with the brokerage firm's clients. 
 Mr. Angell said the best thing the Fed could do -- but was unlikely to -- was to shock financial markets by engineering an increase of one percentage point in short-term interest rates this month, the sources said.
The Fed has already raised interest rates five times this year, but the financial markets have been uneasy that inflation may still become a problem.
Officials at Bear Stearns were not immediately available to confirm Mr. Angell's remarks.

HEADLINE: The New Population Control Weapon

 BODY:
The acrimonious debate over abortion at the world population conference in Cairo has obscured the truly radical element in the document approved by delegates at the final session yesterday: the notion that enhancing the educational, political and economic opportunities for women is perhaps the surest way to curb further population growth.
Previous conferences in this once-a-decade event have favored other solutions, such as economic growth ("development is the best contraceptive") or the provision of family planning services. Each approach can claim successes, and the world has made great progress in reducing the rate of growth in recent decades. But the absolute number of births continues to rise and major problems remain in many impoverished countries. 
 The great contribution of the Cairo declaration is to add another weapon to the arsenal: the empowerment of women. This emphasis was largely at the behest of women's groups, giving the document an odd flavor of feminist rhetoric. But surely it is intuitively right to assume that women, as bearers of the world's children, are in the best position to slow birth rates and that, if given greater opportunities, they will forgo continuous childbearing.
Beyond intuition, there is empirical evidence. The state of Kerala in populous India, though very poor, has reduced its fertility rate to replacement levels, thanks in large part to high levels of female literacy and education and growing economic opportunities for women.
The conference did nothing to elucidate the long-running debate between pessimists who fear population growth will outrun food and natural resources and optimists who believe the world can support much larger numbers. But one does not have to be a Malthusian catastrophist to believe that, in many poor nations, economic and social problems could be more readily mastered if population growth were curbed.
In most minds, the Cairo conference will be remembered for the battle over abortion and sexual issues, pitting the Vatican and many Islamic countries against the U.S. and other secular governments. But its true importance will lie in whether it persuades governments and private groups to adopt programs to control growth rates. The Clinton Administration did a masterful job in defusing the Vatican's diplomatic attack and committing U.S. money and influence to the international effort. In contrast to the sorry performance of the Reagan Administration, which virtually withdrew from the global effort a decade ago, the Americans this time took a forceful and farsighted leadership role.

HEADLINE: In America;
Workers, Unite!

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
There seems to be no limit to the docility of American workers. This is the one group that seems never to assert its rights, or even to acknowledge that it has any.
This is a group that will watch in humble silence as once-proud white collar employees are downsized out of their comfortable offices and into hamburger uniforms, as manufacturing jobs are rounded up and shipped overseas to semi-slaves working in squalid conditions, as massive amounts of research and development money flow into monumentally wasteful military projects at the expense of product development and technical innovation in private industry. 
 This is a group that emitted not so much as a peep as the post-cold war peace dividend evaporated, as wages and benefits for ordinary Americans were deliberately and systematically curtailed, as labor unions were trampled by the government and corporations alike, as the spoils seized by corporate plunderers reached breath-taking levels, and as smug and well-fed economists pompously asserted that the nation could not afford an official unemployment rate that slipped below 6 percent or so. (These same economists don't even mention the real jobless rate).
Where is the anger? Where is the outrage? The politicians, who get elected by the masses but answer to the money, have been telling us that the economy is in swell shape. And the august Federal Reserve Board -- well, it's in a constant state of worry that things are too good.
Reality check: The latest report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm, puts the number of job cuts announced in August at 46,380. So far this year, employer-announced work-force reductions have totaled 365,519, which is not that far below the 400,578 cuts made over the same period last year.
If this is too good, you don't want to be around when things get really bad.
"Employers have eliminated fewer jobs so far this year, but this in no way means that the downsizing trend of the last 20 months is over," James E. Challenger, the president of the outplacement company, reported.
According to Mr. Challenger, the increased merger activity of recent weeks heralds more job cuts in upcoming months. "Since mergers mold two work forces into one new organization," he said, "the issue of job redundancy means certain positions will eventually be eliminated."
Even Labor Secretary Robert Reich, in a speech that tried to put the best face on the nation's employment picture, acknowledged that the middle class has become "an anxious class, most of whom hold jobs but who are justifiably uneasy about their own standing and fearful for their children's futures."
If employed members of the middle class are anxious and fearful, what is to be said about the many millions of unemployed, partially employed and temporarily employed men and women who arise each day with little or no awareness of where their family's rent or meal money is to be found?
What is to be done? Do the employees and potential employees of America continue to take whatever abuses are thrown at them by the ruling elite? Is the idea of a reasonably steady improvement in the quality of life from one generation to another just a quaint notion from the distant past? Is the American Dream dead?
Herbert J. Gans, a professor at Columbia University who has worried about the problem of unemployment since the early 1960's, has what seems to be a sensible proposal. It is time, said Professor Gans, for the formation of an employees lobby, a national organization that would fight against the exploitation of men and women who have to work for a living.
In an article he wrote for Social Policy magazine, Professor Gans said the lobby "would represent employed workers, whatever the shapes and colors of their collars, as well as supervisory and managerial employees of all kinds. It would speak for the jobless as well, and for 'contingent,' 'flexible' and other involuntary part-time workers."
Such a lobby would suddenly place the issue of jobs high on the nation's agenda, the professor said, and would "educate the public both about the drastic changes our economy is facing and the need to address them politically."
The American Association of Retired Persons has shown the kind of clout a well-organized lobby of ordinary citizens can wield. Working men and women would do well to take a cue from their elders.

HEADLINE: At Harvard Club, Work Rules Stall Settlement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Michael T. Kaufman's distorted picture of the strike against the Harvard Club (About New York, Sept. 3) sheds little light on the facts of the dispute between the club and leaders of Local 6 of the Hotel, Restaurant and Club Employees Union. By indulging in stereotypes, Mr. Kaufman does a disservice to all who want the strike settled sooner rather than later, with an agreement that's fair to employees and to the club. 
 We are proud that rather than squeezing out a living as grit and grime, as Mr. Kaufman put it, Harvard Club employees are paid better and receive better benefits, including first-dollar medical coverage, than workers in similar jobs at restaurants and clubs in New York City.
We are ready to increase wages and to continue providing full benefits, but we can only do this if we can also bring into the 20th century the club operations governed by Local 6 work rules -- rules that, for instance, don't allow pot washers to wash dishes or dishwashers to wash pots. Work rules that say bus persons in the dining room can't make coffee, even when they don't have anything else to do, because it's a pantryman's job.
So far, leaders of Local 6 have chosen to stall rather than negotiate. When we tried to keep negotiations going and employees working, Local 6's leaders answered by calling a strike. Every time we've suggested using mediators to help reach an agreement, union leaders have participated grudgingly and walked away at the first opportunity.
Employees are indeed valued members of the Harvard Club family who deserve the job security that comes from a club whose operations are economically sound. We want them back, under a contract that works for all.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Increased 0.3% in August

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Calming fears that inflation might be rising sharply, the Government reported today that consumer prices climbed in August by the same three-tenths of 1 percent that they rose in June and July.
The latest figures caused none of the consternation of Friday, when producer prices showed a surprising surge of six-tenths of 1 percent, roiling the financial markets. Still, many economists maintain that the pace of inflation is increasing, forecasting that consumer prices will rise around 3.5 percent this year after two years of increases of less than 3 percent. 
 Analysts said the August increase in the Consumer Price Index remained moderate because the increases in producer prices -- the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers -- have not yet worked their way to the consumer level. But analysts say that the pressure on consumer prices will continue in the months ahead, as commodity and other prices drift higher.
"We are looking at a slow upcreep," said Eugene J. Sherman, research director at M. A. Schapiro & Company in New York, noting that core inflation has moved up to 3.1 percent in the last six months from 2.6 percent for the six months through February.
Today, the financial markets seemed to react to the news in this light. Bond and stock prices rose after the release of the consumer prices report, but gave up some of their gains later in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 19.52 points. The bond market was at least encouraged that the report renewed its conviction that the Federal Reserve would forgo any further tightening of monetary policy this month and wait at least until the November meeting of its policy-making panel.
In a related report, the Labor Department calculated that average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in August from July. August was the first month this year to post a drop in earnings compared with a year earlier; inflation-adjusted earnings last month were four-tenths of 1 percent below the level of August 1993.
But it was the Consumer Price Index, which rose a tad less than many analysts had expected, that was the main focus of attention. Analysts found themselves reassured that Friday's sharp rise in producer prices represented a convergence of factors that was unlikely to be repeated. They noted that the goods component of the index, accounting for about 43 percent of the total, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in August, the same as in May and June and less than in July.
The narrower producer price indexes include few services or imported goods and their link with what consumers ultimately pay is often loose, economists say.
Analysts also took comfort in the fact that the so-called core consumer index, with the volatile food and energy components removed, also moved up three-tenths of 1 percent last month -- the same rate as in February, March, May and June -- and, thus, was showing no clearly worrisome acceleration. For April and July, the core rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Annual Pace Below 3%
 "We haven't really seen any kind of a sustained pickup" in inflation, said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist with Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
Inflation is now running at a pace of 2.9 percent for the latest 12 months, compared with 2.8 percent for the 12-month period that ended in August 1993.
Patrick C. Jackman, a Labor Department price specialist, pointed to various factors that seemed likely to keep the September rise in consumer prices to a minimum. The price of gasoline, up 3.7 percent in August and 7.8 percent over the latest three months, has turned down, and there will almost certainly be no repeat of coffee's record leaps of about 22 percent in both July and August.
Moreover, seasonal factors may again restrain the apparel component, which fell for the second consecutive month in August on end-of-season sales of spring and summer wear coupled with smaller-than-usual price increases on new fall and winter lines.
"If you look at the very short run, the situation looks better," Mr. Jackman said.
He and others, however, see a gradual rising of inflation into next year, driven in part by an environmental-protection mandate that is expected to raise the price of gasoline by as much as 8 cents a gallon in some metropolitan areas.
 
Consequences of Growth
 Howard Keen Jr., chief economist at Conrail, said it was "hard to believe" that the economy could expand as rapidly as it has -- an average annual pace of 4.5 percent in the latest three full quarters -- without some price acceleration.
He said that his railroad's shipments of truck trailers, mainly filled with consumer goods, are particularly strong, possibly reflecting inventory building by optimistic merchants. Many economists have been assuming that the apparently unwanted inventories that accumulated during the second quarter would be worked off during the summer.
The services component, accounting for just over 56 percent of the index, moved up four-tenths of 1 percent in August, today's report also showed, the third consecutive small acceleration.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE GOVERNOR'S RACE;
The Final Heat Is Between Cuomo and Not-Cuomo

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
Yesterday's primary in New York cleared the way for a gubernatorial election between an incumbent whom many New Yorkers do not like and a Republican challenger whom most do not yet know.
Until now, New York's gubernatorial campaign has revolved around a simple question: is Gov. Mario M. Cuomo so unpopular that the Republicans can end his 12-year reign without ever making a compelling case for his opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki? 
 Mr. Pataki, a 10-year legislator from the Hudson Valley hamlet of Garrison, campaigned for 10 months before winning a convincing victory over Richard M. Rosenbaum yesterday. Yet, polls and random interviews suggest that he has made little connection with New York voters.
He stayed out of public view during much of the primary campaign, preferring to hoard money for the fall. He has pointedly declined to provide details about the most central elements of his platform -- cutting taxes and fighting crime. The lone biographical advertisement broadcast by Mr. Pataki's campaign does not even include the candidate's voice.
 
Aggressive Advertisements
 Campaign strategists have promised that Mr. Pataki's visibility will now begin to grow, starting with a news conference in Manhattan today at which he plans to unveil proposals for improving the state's fiscal and legislative processes. But in the same breath, they vow that they will make the 1994 campaign a referendum on Mr. Cuomo and that they will fuel public antipathy toward his tenure.
Mr. Cuomo's aides believe the Governor may reap some marginal benefit in November from Karen S. Burstein's narrow victory in yesterday's Democratic primary for Attorney General. Her presence on the ticket saves the Democrats from the awkwardness of running an all-male slate against a Republican team that includes two women.
The Cuomo campaign believes that the tandem of Ms. Burstein, a lesbian, and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who was chosen by the Legislature in May 1993 and hopes to become the first black candidate to win a statewide election, will generate enthusiasm among women, homosexuals and minorities and produce a large turnout of the Governor's Democratic base.
Mr. Pataki's fuzzy definition and his eagerness to keep the focus on Mr. Cuomo has made for a general election campaign that turned ugly long before it officially started. Mr. Pataki has assailed Mr. Cuomo's fiscal policies and opposition to the death penalty while also accusing him of misusing his office for private gain.
Mr. Cuomo's campaign has responded by trying to depict Mr. Pataki, in the words of Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, as "a small-time politician who cuts corners." It has raised questions about Mr. Pataki's personal finances, his consistency on issues and the political patronage of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
But with Mr. Cuomo's approval ratings hovering about 35 percent, a dangerously low level for any incumbent, he also carries a heavy burden.
 
Differences in Advice
 Some Democratic leaders worry that the Governor still has not articulated a rationale for a fourth term. Without such a vision, they said, voters may spend the fall trying to decide not only who Mr. Pataki is, but who Mr. Cuomo wants to be, and how his 13th year might differ from the previous 12.
Up to now, Mr. Cuomo has tended to look back as well as forward, seeking to deepen the uncertainty about Mr. Pataki by speaking of the stature required to run a state like New York.
"It really is a contest," Mr. Cuomo said last week, "of the current Governor against another person who will have to run the 10th-largest economy in the world, deal with 16 hostages at Ossining, deal with the explosion at the World Trade Center, take on the President of the United States when he says, 'I'm going to disallow the deductibility of state and local taxes,' stand in the middle of Crown Heights, etc., etc."
Political strategists differ, meanwhile, over whether Mr. Pataki must give voters a reason to support him beyond the inarguable fact that he is not Mr. Cuomo.
"Pataki is more an agent than an actor," said Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant who has worked in New York. "People will vote either for Cuomo or against Cuomo and all Pataki has to do is meet a minimal standard of acceptance. He doesn't have to establish a Pataki agenda."
Robert M. Shrum, a Democratic consultant who worked on both of David N. Dinkins's mayoral campaigns, disagreed. "For Pataki to think he can take disapproval numbers and turn them into votes for himself without giving people an affirmative reason to vote for an alternative is a big mistake," he said.
For instance, Senator Arlen Specter alienated Pennsylvania voters by defending Clarence Thomas against Anita Hill, yet beat Lynn Yeakel in 1992 by depicting her as a single-issue candidate and by highlighting her lateness in paying income taxes.
In other campaigns, however, challengers have managed to defeat unpopular chief executives by focusing on the frailties of the incumbent.
Despite deep public concerns about his character, Bill Clinton became President in 1992 by exploiting the public's dissatisfaction with George Bush. And Christine Todd Whitman defeated Jim Florio in New Jersey's gubernatorial race last year by relentlessly reminding voters that he had raised taxes.
Mr. Pataki considers Mrs. Whitman something of a role model. But she had one major advantage that he lacks -- a prior statewide race (in 1990 against Senator Bill Bradley) that gave the voters a chance get comfortable with her.
"She had been around the track and it was on the second occasion that she was successful," said Lee M. Miringoff, a New York pollster. "Pataki has to use the campaign to send a message to voters about the competence with which he would govern."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Simmons Market Research Bureau changes its methodology to try to reverse some setbacks.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE Simmons Market Research Bureau is overhauling its longtime survey methodology and naming a new president and chief executive. The important changes come as the company seeks to resolve a fractious dispute over magazine audience measurement.
Data from Simmons and its principal rival, Mediamark Research Inc., help agencies decide where to spend billions of dollars a year in magazine and newspaper advertisements. With the 1995 survey to be released in May, Simmons will change how its interviews ask questions for the first time since its founding in 1963. 
 The new Simmons methodology, while perhaps less painstaking, is less time-consuming and less expensive. And it is far more like the manner by which Mediamark has gathered data for the last 15 years.
"A research product, like any other product, has to evolve to meet the needs of its market," said Rebecca McPheters, who will succeed Ellen Cohen as president and chief executive.
Though the Simmons switch is not as momentous as the Coca-Cola Company concocting a "New" Coke that tastes like Pepsi, it represents a sea change for the company, which hopes its new "Survey of American Readership" will reverse setbacks ranging from the increasing reluctance of consumers to participate in lengthy surveys to the increasing defections of important clients like Conde Nast Publications and Hearst Magazines.
"The writing is on the wall," Tim Bowles, chief executive at the MRB Group in London, parent of Simmons, said.
"After a very long period of soul-searching," he added, "we decided we'd try to develop an improved application of the 'recent reading' method." His reference was to the Mediamark methodology, so named because consumers answer questions about articles in publications they say they have recently read.
Simmons, by contrast, has used a methodology called "through the book," named after the interviewing process by which respondents page through mockups of actual issues to determine whether they have read those publications. Since that takes more time than "recent reading," Simmons surveyed 140 titles to Mediamark's 230.
"In terms of competition for client business, that was a disadvantage," Mr. Bowles acknowledged. Though Simmons's approach was better, he asserted, because "we were using the power of recognition rather than recall, you can't have everything."
Stuart Gray, senior vice president for media research at BBDO Worldwide in New York, said: "We would have preferred for Simmons to have found some solution to continuing the 'through-the-book' technique. It's the superior method for developing estimates of average issue readership. But we're accepting of the fact it was just not viable, and we will be supportive of that decision in terms of looking at the new data."
While "we'll have to look at the data with fresh eyes, so to speak," Mr. Gray said, "because this is such a dramatic departure in their methodology," one major benefit is that with both companies using the "recent reading" methodology, "it will be easy to compare both sets of data."
Steven T. Florio, president at Conde Nast, said he "will certainly take a look at" Simmons's new readership survey, and "listen to what they have to say.
"But we're already committed to not committing," he added, referring to a recent decision not to buy Simmons data for the coming year, which the trade publication Inside Media estimated will cost Simmons nearly $1 million in lost revenue.
Mr. Bowles, however, is dedicated to regaining departed clients, declaring, "If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be here."
Ms. McPheters said she was "particularly excited" by the Simmons's measures "to further develop magazine audience research." For instance, in another change, Simmons will part company with Mediamark in compiling and reporting readership and marketing data in single reports by separating them into a "New Study of Media and Markets" along with the "Survey of American Readership."
Ms. McPheters, 44, joins Simmons after only recently arriving at Gruner & Jahr U.S.A. Publishing, which acquired her previous employer, The New York Times Company Women's Magazines, where she was senior vice president and group executive. Ms. McPheters will succeed Ms. Cohen, who has been president and chief executive for the last five years, on Sept. 26.
Ms. Cohen said she planned to start a consulting company, with Simmons as an initial client. She added that her discussions about leaving started in November, well before the dispute over audience measurement. Mr. Bowles agreed that Ms. Cohen's departure was coincidental and praised her as "a champion of our new products."
The dispute involves a once-confidential draft report by members of a committee of the Magazine Publishers of America, the trade organization representing the magazine industry. It labeled as "perplexing" the basis for compiling certain data -- unrelated to the "through-the-book" methodology -- that reported a steep decline in potential readers of magazines.
The data were "a blip," Mr. Bowles said, adding that in the 1994 survey, the potential-reader figures returned to more historical levels.
The dispute grew unpleasant enough that the American Association of Advertising Agencies -- where Mr. Gray is chairman of the media research committee -- is seeking to defuse it by convening a meeting on Sept. 23 with executives from Simmons, the publishers association, Mediamark and the Advertising Research Foundation.
"I'm anxious we, as quickly as possible, answer any questions they have" about Simmons data, Ms. McPheters said, adding, "We have absolutely nothing to hide."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA;
Barry Victory Reveals Widening Racial Rift

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Even in a city with a long tradition of racial polarization, the split between black and white voters in Marion S. Barry Jr.'s dramatic victory in the Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday was a surprise.
Not because Mr. Barry swept Washington's poor black neighborhoods and won almost no support in the rich white ones, but because he attracted a surprisingly large number of voters from the city's middle-class blacks. The results only seemed to widen the gulf between the races here. 
 Today, many whites felt isolated by their dislike of Mr. Barry and angered that a convicted drug user will represent the Democratic Party in November's election instead of Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly or Councilman John Ray, who are also black and who had relied heavily in the past on whites and the large black middle-class for a winning coalition.
"I think its a real embarrassment," Barry Stahl, a 44-year-old white supporter of Mr. Ray, said in a typical assessment by white voters of Mr. Barry's victory. "It has got to be bad for the city. A lot of people are already moving out, fearful of the direction the city is going. This is going to make it worse."
Mr. Barry's victory appeared to reflect a sense of anger and dissatisfaction among blacks of all economic classes -- not just with Mr. Barry's rivals, who offered experience but no passion, but also with the circumstances of living in a city where the local government and its budget are largely controlled by Congress.
"This election was not just a validation of Marion Barry," said Councilman Kevin Chavous of Ward 7, Mr. Barry's strongest area of support. "It was a statement against a lot of things, like people being told who should lead them. I heard that all over the city. People don't like being told what to do."
That sort of feeling is only likely to grow more intense if Congress reacts to Mr. Barry's almost inevitable election in November by trying to revoke the limited self-government here known as "home rule."
Representative James H. Saxton, a New Jersey Republican who sits on the House Committee on the District of Columbia, foreshadowed that struggle today, saying, "If Marion Barry does somehow manage to ascend to the mayoral seat, we must examine the D.C. governing process and whether it is a truly effective use of taxpayer funds."
Mayor Kelly, who swept into office four years ago as a reformer on the heels of Mr. Barry's drug arrest and conviction after 12 years as Mayor, was thoroughly rejected, receiving only 13 percent of the vote. Mr. Ray, in his fourth bid for mayor, had his best showing ever, with 37 percent.
Mr. Barry carried all six wards in which blacks are the majority; Mr. Ray carried the two wards with white majorities. In Ward 3, a northwest district that has the city's highest concentration of whites, Mr. Barry won just 3.4 percent of the vote, compared with the 29.4 percent he won in the 1986 primary, 34.3 percent in 1982 and 46.8 percent in 1978.
Mr. Barry was asked at a news conference today what he would say to the city's white voters.
"Get over it," he answered. "Get over whatever personal hangups you got. I am the best person for Washington. I know best how to protect their home, their investment. I know best how to balance this budget. I know best how to save our city from financial collapse, I know best how to get us moving."
Despite a widespread belief before the primary that Mr. Barry would have difficulty moving beyond his base of lower-income supporters, his victory showed that his campaign themes cut across economic lines among blacks. In Ward 4, where many professional blacks, including Mayor Kelly, live, Mr. Barry won almost 50 percent of the vote. He won more than half of the votes in Ward 5, a middle-class area where Mr. Ray lives.
Like lower-income blacks -- but unlike many whites -- they were drawn to the notion of revival and redemption. Throughout his campaign, Mr. Barry tried presenting his problems with the law, which included six months in a Federal prison, as an advantage. He portrayed himself as better now than before, for overcoming drug and alcohol addiction and rehabilitating himself.
"God bless him," Adrian Alexander, a 40-year-old black correctional officer, said today on a cluttered sidewalk in Ward 8, the poorest in the city, and where the vote was 10-to-1 for Mr. Barry over Mr. Ray. "This proves he can come back from adversity."
But another theme appeared to emerge, too: a strong, almost angry signal by blacks, which make up nearly 70 percent of Washington's population, that voters are weary of being controlled by a predominantly white establishment.
Councilman Chavous and others suggested that themes of revival and control might not have held such sway, were it not for a general disaffection with Mrs. Kelly and a failure to connect with Mr. Ray.
Also, Mr. Barry put together an aggressive corps of staffers and volunteers, who registered thousands of voters, plastered the city with posters and criss-crossed streets on election day, driving voters to the polls.
"I got my first job in one of his summer youth programs," said Darlene Chaney, a 28-year-old unemployed black Barry supporter. "I know he fell when he got busted. But that has nothing to do with it. Everybody has their problem. I don't look at his problems; I look at what he did for the city."

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN WITH HAITI: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Clinton Plans Speech to Head Off Clash With Congress

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Running out of time to make the case that restoring democracy to Haiti is worth the costs of invasion, President Clinton plans to address the nation Thursday not so much to persuade the public as to head off an ugly clash with Congress, Administration officials said today.
It was plain today that Mr. Clinton remains a reluctant warrior. As Administration officials disclosed that he had approved a plan to offer Haiti's military leaders a comfortable life in exile, the image of fortitude that he sought to convey to visiting reporters was tempered by one of a man searching for a way out of a political quandary. 
 Aides to Mr. Clinton said today that he recognized that he might not change many minds about an invasion that, according to polls, two-thirds of Americans regard as unwise. But he has decided that his 20-month-old standoff with Haiti's junta must not continue, they said, and he hopes that the power of his office will persuade the junta that he means what he says. He also hopes to prevail upon Congress not to stand in the way.
The President could still order an invasion of Haiti even if Congress formally advised him not to. But no one at the White House seems eager to risk such election-year defiance, and aides to Mr. Clinton are working with Congressional leaders in hopes of putting off any vote on the issue or making it merely symbolic to minimize the political complications.
"It is not time for a divisive debate about this," Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said today. "It is time to present a unified front."
Mr. Clinton's aides remain skeptical that anything short of force can push the Haitian leaders from power. But as the White House stepped up the tempo of its warnings, saying the time for the junta was running "very, very short," the President and his aides were trying harder than ever before to find a resonant argument that an invasion would be just and proper.
In a preview of his Oval Office address, Mr. Clinton told a group of news agency reporters today that the situation in Haiti was a kind of watershed. If left uncorrected, he said, Haiti's slide back to dicatorship would bode ill for fledgling democracies elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. He portrayed Haiti as a killing field in which the United States has a moral obligation to halt human rights abuses.
And having threatened since May to stage an invasion unless Haiti's military leaders stepped down on their own, the President warned that the credibility not just of his Administration but also of the United States would be at stake unless he made good on his threats.
Saying he had already shown "extremely good faith and forbearance," he added, "The United States must not be in a position to walk away from a situation like this."
"I know it is unpopular," Mr. Clinton said of a possible invasion. "I know the timing is unpopular. I know the whole thing is unpopular. But I believe it is the right thing."
Since Mr. Clinton first threatened to use force to oust Haiti's junta, his aides have said he recognized that he was on a path in which he would see no option but to go forward with an invasion if economic sanctions alone did not force it from power.
Administration officials said any effort to persuade Congress and the public that a relatively insignificant country like Haiti was worth American blood and dollars was bound to be an uphill struggle.
"Inevitably, there was going to be a large controversy about sending troops to a place that most American people regard as peripheral to our interests," a senior official said.
But some officials acknowledged that the White House had also squandered some chances to win public backing for forceful action. They said they had failed to anticipate the degree to which the liberal Democrats who were the most vocal proponents of an invasion would remain at odds from mainstream Democrats as well as Republicans. And they said they had underestimated the opposition from groups like the American Legion, which can usually be counted on to support military operations abroad. Today, the Legion wrote Mr. Clinton expressing its opposition to an invasion.
The officials also said they had failed to call sufficient attention to the magnitude of human rights abuses in Haiti.
"Could more have been done to condition the public?" a senior Administration official said. "Yes, but we were also heavily involved in health care and crime and Cuba and a lot of other issues. Now we have a clear field of vision."
As part of the effort to build support in Congress, especially among wavering Democrats, senior officials have been meeting at the White House every day this week to devise the new public relations campaign. They include David R. Gergen, a special adviser to Mr. Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Mark D. Gearan, the White House communications director.
The group has recommended that the President seek in his speech on Thursday night "to put a graphic face" on human rights violations there, an official said tonight.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Drops

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus fell 18.8 percent in August as imports rose sharply. The figures provide some evidence that the steep appreciation of the yen in the last year and a half may finally be working to cut the huge trade imbalance.
However, Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States continued to rise, to $3.49 billion in August, up 2 percent from $3.42 billion a year earlier. That is because the strong American economy continued to soak up such Japanese products as semiconductors, liquid crystal displays, autos and auto parts and machine tools. 
 While the overall trade surplus declined when measured in yen, it has not decreased when measured in dollars because each yen is worth more in dollars now.
The latest figures were announced by the Finance Ministry as a deadline set by the Clinton Administration approaches for Japan and the United States to reach trade agreements in several areas by the end of the month.
Japan's overall trade surplus, on a customs clearance basis, narrowed to $6.08 billion in August. In June and July, Japan's surplus increased over the same months a year earlier.
Imports in August soared 23.6 percent, more than offsetting a healthy gain of 12.2 percent in exports. Analysts said the import figures were increased by special factors that might not be repeated, such as large imports of crude oil to generate electricity during an unusually hot summer and some airplane purchases.

The not so clear and present danger of inflation.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
"STOCK up on canned sardines and ammo for the deer rifle, mama, and spend those greenbacks while you can. . . ."
Inflation hysteria has not yet brought the survivalists out of the woodwork, and news this week that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of less than 4 percent in August may keep them there a while longer. But as Van Doorn Ooms, the chief economist for the Committee for Economic Development, puts it, "there's an edginess out there" that is rubbed a little rawer by every ambiguous Government report on inflation and every passing remark by a member of the Fed that does not begin and end with a genuflection toward the gods of price stability. 
 The most sensible view, many economists argue, is that this glass is at least half full -- that while the American economy is operating near the limits of noninflationary growth, price changes to date reflect little more than the recovery of profitability in commodities and other cyclically sensitive industries. The tricky moment will come if and when wages begin to catch up with prices: "I'm amazed it has taken so long," allowed Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University.
The inflation scare of the month was August's unexpected jump of six-tenths of a percent in what used to be called wholesale prices. That followed a five-tenths of a percent increase in July, implying that the annual rate is pushing 7 percent. Look closer, though, and it is apparent that much of the inflation has been in raw materials, whose prices have been depressed for much of the last decade. "It's classic," said David Hale, an economist at the Kemper Financial Group. "First commodity prices rise, then intermediate goods, then finished products."
Indeed, said Richard Cooper, an economist at Harvard, it is not only classic but desirable. Producers of everything from aluminum ingots to paper have to be highly profitable on the up side of the business cycle to compensate for anemic margins or even losses on the down side. By the same token, if demand does not continue to grow faster than the capacity, producer prices should level off.
So why is everyone so touchy? Remember, for starters, that bond dealers are obsessed with prices because higher inflation translates into lower bond prices. And for reasons unclear, the ranks of opinion leaders who have confused the interests of a handful of Wall Street businesses with those of the nation seem to have grown in recent years.
But there is more at work here than bond dealers' inclination to let Joe Sixpack drink Dom Perignon. While cyclic increases in prices don't bother economists, the prospect of an inflationary spiral -- one that is self-reinforcing and independent of actual shortages -- surely does.
The widely accepted mechanism, known as the "natural rate hypothesis," goes like this: Ordinarily, competition prevents workers from making wage demands in excess of productivity gains stick. But once markets become overheated, producers try (and succeed) in passing higher costs to buyers. Most disturbing, the process is not self-limiting; once unemployment is below the natural rate, the inflation tiger is fated to chase its tail at ever-increasing speed.
In a speech earlier this month, Alan S. Blinder, the new vice chairman of the Fed, pointed out that no one truly knows what the natural rate is. Hence the eternal job of the Fed is making trade-offs between the risk of embedding expectations of inflation and the risk of accepting unnecessarily high unemployment.
That restatement of what virtually every economist considers obvious apparently did not win Mr. Blinder any friends among those accustomed to Fed governors who talk about inflation the way Jimmy Swaggart talked about sin. Nor is what Mr. Ooms dismisses as "a tempest in a teapot" likely to increase Mr. Blinder's chances for promotion to chairman of the Fed when Alan Greenspan's term expires.
But the trade-off really, truly is the primary task of the Fed -- and one that could become increasingly difficult in coming months. For one thing, Mr. Hale points out, world markets for commodities are likely to continue to tighten because of the European economic recovery and boom in East Asia. More important, labor may begin to flex its atrophied muscles.
At a comparable point in the 1987-90 upturn in the business cycle, Mr. Gordon notes, wage demands were running two percentage points higher than today. And while there has been much chatter about the brave new world in which everyone is afraid to ask for a raise lest their jobs end up in Indonesia, there is little hard evidence that global labor competition makes much difference outside of a dozen high-profile manufacturing industries.
Most business cycles, it seems, end in a flurry of shortages and a screech of the monetary brakes. And if history is any judge, said Charles Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution and veteran of the Carter Administration, "we'll probably do it again." That is a long way from saying, though, that inflation is a clear and present danger.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Assessing the Exxon Valdez trial, analysts are divided.

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas 

 BODY:
AS the jurors deliberate on whether Exxon should pay punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, should investors worry? Responding to that question, Wall Street analysts are in conflict.
Some analysts say avoid the stock until the damages are awarded. Others advise waiting even longer, because Exxon's bill could be reduced after appeals. 
 Others say that investors should hold on to their stock, and some even suggest buying it now, since it is almost 13 percent below this year's high of $67.375. These analysts argue that there is a good chance that the jury's award will be moderate, paving the way for a quick rise in the stock price. In addition, they argue that Exxon's earnings outlook is improving because some of the company's businesses, including the huge European operations, are on the rebound.
The jury, meeting in United States District Court in Anchorage, is expected to reach its decision soon. Even if the jury awards the full $15 billion that the plaintiffs' lawyers are seeking, analysts say that Exxon, the world's second-largest publicly traded oil company, after Royal Dutch/Shell, has the financial strength and legal stamina to suffer only limited damage.
"Exxon has deep pockets," said Frank P. Knuettel of Prudential Securities, and it is sure to appeal, he added, which will buy time. There is also a good chance it could negotiate the amount down. Exxon has put together a legal team that was able to convince the jury on Aug. 12 to award commercial fishermen $286.8 million in damages for the 1989 spill, less than a third the $895 million that had been sought.
In addition, Mr. Knuettel predicted that the jury would reject the plaintiffs' main argument that a huge settlement would teach Exxon a lesson.
Frederick Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear Stearns, calculated that if Exxon borrowed to pay a $15 billion award, its interest cost would reduce earnings about 55 cents a share a year. He expects Exxon to earn about $3.35 a share this year and $4.50 next year, compared with $4.21 a share in 1993 on net income of $5.28 billion.
"It's certainly not life threatening, but the dividend growth rate could fall below that of its competitors," he added.
Mr. Leuffer, who advised investors to avoid the stock as the trial neared, predicts that Exxon could manage to pay an award on the high end without a major impact on its long-term earnings potential. He is sure, however, that there will be an impact on the stock. "If the jury can come back with $5 billion," he added, "the stock will still get hit. Who needs the headache?"
He favors avoiding the stock until it becomes clear what Exxon will have to pay, which could mean waiting out a long appeal process. Only then, he said, will it be clear whether Exxon can keep paying its high dividend, which now equals about 5 percent of the stock price.
But Mr. Knuettel argues that if investors shun Exxon now, they could miss a nice rally.
Exxon stock dropped about $8 to $59 a share in the weeks before the jury found that Exxon's "recklessness" had caused the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. The stock closed yesterday at $58.75, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus, if the jury awards a reasonable amount, he said, it could send the stock up.
"You are going to see some good increase in production and a rebound in the European economies," added Mary Quinn, an oil analyst for the S. G. Warburg Group. Uncertainty about the trial has given investors an opportunity to buy Exxon "relatively cheap," she said.

The Cold War Armies Meet, Just to Link Arms

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BIEDRUSKO, Poland, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Sgt. Timothy Britt came off the target range at the military training field in this small Polish village brimming with relief.
"They're more disciplined than I thought," said the American soldier, who is based in Germany, as he looked toward the platoon of Polish soldiers. "To put it bluntly, I'm glad they are our friends now. I wouldn't want to go against them." 
 Nearly 1,000 soldiers from 13 countries on opposing sides of the cold war gathered on Polish territory this week for exercises that were billed as the first practical demonstration of how former enemies can work together.
The exercises were conducted under the Partnership for Peace begun by NATO in January to encourage former Warsaw Pact countries to come closer to the Western alliance without becoming full members.
Troops from the United States, Germany, Britain, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands, all NATO countries, and from Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Romania and Ukraine, all part of the former Warsaw Pact alliance, worked together on peacekeeping tasks like escorting food convoys, dealing with refugees and changing guard at observation posts.
An important part of the exercises, which were kept fairly modest in part not to antagonize Russia, a late-joining member of Partnership for Peace, was political. The presence on Polish soil of 105 friendly German soldiers set the tone.
"Anyone who knows even a little bit about history knows this is not a routine event when Polish and German soldiers are working together," the German Defense Minister, Volker Ruhe, said as he sat alongside the Polish Defense Minister, Piotr Kolodziejczyk, at a joint news conference. "It shows how well German-Polish relations are developing."
The participation of German troops here was particularly symbolic because this area of Poland, 80 miles east of the German border, was once part of Germany.
In the post-cold-war era, Germany has become one of the biggest advocates of the admission of Poland, as well as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, to the European Union and NATO. "I personally think this will happen before 2000," Mr. Ruhe said of their joining NATO.
After Poland becomes a member of NATO, Polish and German military cooperation could become as close as that now between France and Germany, Mr. Ruhe said.
Beyond the political symbolism, the operations were an eye-opener for the soldiers. They inspected one another's weapons, looked over tanks and helicopters.
"How is this grenade fired?" asked Capt. Robert Burns, who was visiting as an observer from Fort Leavenworth, Kan., as he handled a Polish soldier's rocket-propelled grenade. "It's an inertia type switch motor," the Pole replied.
Captain Burns said he learned a lot from the exercise. The Americans use disposable launchers with such equipment; the Poles reload their launchers, making such equipment more like a bazooka. The close inspection of each other's weapons was fascinating and also essential if these former enemy armies were ever going to operate together, the soldiers said.
The Americans said they also confirmed in the open what they had known for years through intelligence and books: that Western rifles were designed for more accuracy and Warsaw Pact rifles for shooting at shorter range.
There was a certain amount of American chauvinism about weapons. "They're just as curious as we are, if not more," said Sgt. Kenneth Cook, who belongs to an American platoon from Kirch Gons, Germany, taking part in the exercise. "They were really curious about our Bradley antipersonnel carrier, how far it can shoot and how much steel it can penetrate. Their APC's penetrate up to 14 centimeters of steel. Our Bradleys can fire through 18 inches of steel."
An American helicopter, a Black Hawk, and a Polish helicopter, a Falcon, stood at the ready, side by side, for any medical emergencies. "The difference? Porsche to Volkswagen," said Sgt. Gilberto Vallejo of the same American Army unit, giving the Black Hawk the upper hand even though it was several years older.
But the after-hours socializing in the evening and the sharing of living quarters helped deflate prejudices.
"Before we came here, the opinions of the Polish Army and the Warsaw Pact countries were not so high among my soldiers," said Lieut. Jeremy Nathan, who headed the American platoon. "Now they realize they are soldiers who are quite capable and quite human, too. I'm sharing a room with Polish Lieut. Jaroslaw Strozyk. His wife is pregnant and is expecting in one month's time. But she might deliver early and he is on the phone to her twice a day."
What did Lieutenant Strozyk think of the Americans? "The American soldiers are very noisy, very talkative, a little bit crazy," he said with a smile, listening to the American platoon shouting back to a command in language largely indecipherable to a non-American soldier. "This is a very interesting technique. Perhaps we should get the Americans to instruct the Polish soldiers to say these things."

HEADLINE: Prudential To Buy Back Investments

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Prudential Securities Inc. plans to buy back more than $70 million worth of mortgage investments that were improperly sold to hundreds of retail investors as being less risky than they actually were, executives with the firm said yesterday.
The investments were improperly sold during the spring and early summer of this year, the executives said, and they are showing large losses. Prudential believes customer losses on the investments totaled at least $10 million. 
 A mortgage trader for the firm has already been dismissed in the incident, said Charles Perkins, a Prudential spokesman. He declined to identify the trader. The firm said the trader provided inaccurate data to Prudential's retail sales force in documents that understated the true risk of the investments, known as collateralized mortgage obligations, or C.M.O.'s. The brokers selling the investments unknowingly passed that false information on to buyers.
In the documents, the analysis of how the mortgage investments would perform in various interest-rate environments was apparently adjusted to minimize their true risk. The trader "was rejiggering the calculations," Mr. Perkins said.
Mr. Perkins declined to speculate on the trader's motivation. But other Prudential executives noted that decreasing the stated risks would result in higher sales.
The problem comes at a particularly difficult time for Prudential Securities. Last October, the firm settled charges with Federal and state regulators that it fraudulently misrepresented the risk of more than $8 billion worth of limited partnerships in real estate, oil wells and other assets sold throughout the 1980's. The cost to the firm from that scandal, both in settlements and legal costs, is more than $1.1 billion.
A criminal investigation by the United States Attorney in Manhattan has resulted from the partnership scandal. In a recent meeting with a group of about 20 top firm executives, Hardwick Simmons, the chief executive of the firm, said Prudential expected to hear from prosecutors in the near future what the next stage of that investigation might be.
Although on a much smaller scale, the latest problem with the mortgage investments is reminiscent of the same troubles that led to the partnership scandal. Marketing materials given to brokers of the firm misrepresented the highly risky partnerships as safe and secure investments. But eventually, most of the partnerships collapsed, resulting in losses of billions of dollars for the firm and of customer relationships for many of its top brokers.
The improper sales of the mortgage investments were detected internally by Prudential, and the firm has not received any customer complaints on the matter, Mr. Perkins said. "We are proactively reaching out to investors and offering to buy their bonds back," he said. The bonds will be repurchased at their original sales price.
C.M.O.'s are pools of mortgages that have been cut into separate pieces called tranches, which are tailored to suit different investors' tastes for risk and return. A given tranche may include only principal or only interest, and may mature anywhere from three to 30 years. Its value may move with prevailing interest rates or against them.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE GOVERNOR'S RACE;
SWIPING AT CUOMO, PATAKI GIVES OUT PLAN ON GOVERNING

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
After campaigning for 10 months on hazy promises to cut taxes, fight crime and reduce spending, State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, yesterday issued the first of what he said would be a series of detailed plans for changing state government. And he used the occasion to attack Gov. Mario M. Cuomo as the author of "failed liberal policies" that had caused great problems for the state.
On the day after both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Cuomo easily won their primary races, the Governor, a three-term incumbent, kicked off his general election campaign by announcing a new state-financed transportation program in Buffalo. 
 Later in the day, Mr. Cuomo scoffed at Mr. Pataki's contention that he would be an agent of change. "The only changes these guys are good at is change of position," he said after accepting the endorsement of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union in Manhattan.
Mr. Pataki's campaign began broadcasting three new statewide television commercials that underscore his support of proposals with strong anti-incumbent appeal: term limits and citizen initiative and referendum. All the commercials end with a new slogan: "Mario Cuomo: too liberal for too long."
"We will be reminding people of his liberal record, and that it's been a failed liberal record," said Robert Ryan, Mr. Pataki's campaign manager.
There were also signs yesterday that Mr. Pataki was still having problems uniting the Republicans. Though he has won the endorsement of his primary rival, Richard M. Rosenbaum, he has yet to pin down support from the Mayor of New York City, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who again yesterday left open the door to endorsing Mr. Cuomo and said he had not yet scheduled a meeting with Mr. Pataki.
"My support, lack of support or degree of support is going to turn very very much on where I believe each of the candidates is going to help New York City," Mr. Giuliani said at City Hall.
In a move that was considered beneficial to the Cuomo campaign, the State Board of Elections invalidated petitions submitted by the Rev. Al Sharpton's Freedom Party to be on the Nov. 8 ballot. The party's ticket would have included Colin Moore, the lawyer, running for governor and Mr. Sharpton running for United States Senate. Mr. Sharpton lost to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
If left on the ballot, the Freedom Party likely would have drawn black voters away from Mr. Cuomo, whose political fate could rest on the depth of his support among blacks, women and liberals. Beverly Alston, director of Mr. Sharpton's Manhattan operations, said the Freedom Party would appeal the decision in State Supreme Court.
Three of the tickets in the general election -- the Republican, Conservative and Tax Cut Now parties -- will feature Mr. Pataki and his running mates: Betsy P. McCaughey for lieutenant governor, Herbert London for comptroller, Dennis C. Vacco for attorney general and Bernadette Castro for Senate.
The Democratic and Liberal lines will be identical: Mr. Cuomo, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, Comptroller H. Carl McCall, Karen S. Burstein for attorney general and Mr. Moynihan.
In addition, the Right to Life Party, which won 4 percent of the vote in the 1990 gubernatorial race and could cut into Mr. Pataki's conservative base, will field a full ticket led by its candidate for governor, Robert Walsh.
Mr. Cuomo, who has yet to accept Mr. Pataki's challenge for five one-on-one debates, suggested yesterday that he would insist on having minor-party candidates present at any forums featuring him and Mr. Pataki. "How do you leave out the Right to Life candidate?" he said in Manhattan.
In releasing what he called an "agenda for change" on a day of intensified media attention to the race, Mr. Pataki seemed intent on doing two things: quickly putting Mr. Cuomo on the defensive while answering critics who have said he has dithered in defining his programs. Mr. Pataki said the plan was just the first of several, and that later policy papers would deal with cutting taxes, stimulating the economy and combating crime.
Mr. Pataki called for five things that he said would make government more responsive to citizens. He would impose limits of six two-year terms on state legislators and two four-year terms on all statewide elected officials. He would support initiative and referendum, allowing citizens to place legislative proposals on the ballot through petitions.
He would require public debate on budget proposals and prevent the all-night sessions that have traditionally enabled the Legislature to pass bills without public scrutiny. And he would reduce by 20 percent the number of patronage appointments made by the Governor. Mr. Cuomo controls 3,831 jobs, his press office said, though Mr. Pataki said the figure was much higher.
"We have a system that has become insulated from the will of the people," Mr. Pataki said in announcing his proposals at his Manhattan campaign headquarters.
Mr. Pataki said he was confident that he could persuade New York's lawmakers to accept term limits. But of the 17 states that have term limits for state or Federal officials, only in Utah did state legislators impose limits on themselves, said Tommy Neal, a policy specialist for the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the other 16 states, term limits were approved by voters in referendums.
While Mr. Pataki's aides said term limits could be imposed by the Legislature itself, Mr. Cuomo said it would require a constitutional amendment, which would first have to be passed by two consecutive Legislatures and then approved by voters.
Mr. Cuomo has opposed term limits on the grounds that they can prevent the best candidate from serving. But he has also said that he might endorse term limits if the Legislature does not approve campaign spending limits and other measures.
Though he has not endorsed full initiative and referendum, Mr. Cuomo has proposed legislation that would enable citizens to force the Legislature to vote on existing bills that have been bottled up in committee. And he has long advocated having term limits, initiative and referendum and other ideas debated at a constitutional convention.
In Manhattan yesterday, Mr. Cuomo accused Republican lawmakers, including Mr. Pataki, of blocking his proposals on government ethics and campaign spending.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain Ground, With Dow Up 15.47

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In the second consecutive day of advancing prices, the stock market yesterday gained back about three-quarters of the ground it lost when it received a clear and unambiguous signal of wholesale inflation on Friday.
Since then, the inflation data have returned to being unclear and ambiguous to the market, with the Consumer Price Index appearing mild on Tuesday and the Federal Reserve's "beige book" report yesterday showing a slowing economy. The specter of the Fed again raising interest rates has receded somewhat, although many economists say that the inflationary pressures seen in the producer price report on Friday have not yet worked their way to the consumer level. 
 So stock prices have moved higher in active trading, and the sideways market of the summer, in which prices oscillate within a wide range, seems to have returned.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.47 points, to 3,895.33, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.28 points, to 468.80. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.78 points, to 768.61.
The Dow so far has made up about 35 points of the 48-point drop on Friday and Monday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 298.5 million shares changing hands, about 4 percent above this year's average of 286 million shares. In five of the last six sessions, the trading volume has been at or near 300 million shares, perhaps signaling a return to active trading by professional investors who had spent much of the summer on the sidelines.
But bond prices, which rose for the day, may have also affected stock prices to some extent for nearly four hours. A power blackout at the Chicago Board of Trade, the Midwestern hub for fixed-income trading, led to a de facto national trading halt in bonds because traders could not call up prices on their computer screens. Stock traders often take their cue from the bond market.
Whether the Chicago problem, attributed to a power-related computer problem, helped or hurt stocks was not completely clear yesterday. But a surge of bond buying when Chicago trading resumed probably helped to lift stock prices, which had been drifting upward during the bond halt.
In addition, financial instruments for agricultural commodities are traded in Chicago and both stock and bond traders scrutinize such prices for clues to inflation.
For example, the Commodity Research Bureau futures price index yesterday was flat for much of the day because price components like wheat and soybean meal were knocked out in Chicago. For the day, the C.R.B. index of 21 commodities closed down 2.14 points, to 230.39, but the number was probably invalid because platinum prices were still unavailable at the end of the day.
The most notable stocks yesterday were General Electric and Walt Disney. Walt Disney is in discussions to buy General Electric's NBC television network for as much as $5 billion, according to several executives close to the negotiations. Disney's stock fell 1 point, to 41 3/8, and shares of General Electric rose 3/4, to 50 1/4..
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.64 point, to 258.48, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks, 1,108 to 1,058. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.52 point, to 457.33.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 20 stocks rose, led by Caterpillar, which rose 1 1/2, to 55 1/8, after its announcement of sharply higher heavy-equipment exports to Mexico.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Weaker vs. Mark But Gains Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in thin, volatile trading yesterday.
The dollar briefly hit a two-year low against the Swiss franc, which also strengthened broadly against leading European currencies as investors pulled out of German marks ahead of federal elections on Oct. 16, analysts said. Many currency dealers consider the Swiss franc and the mark to be the so-called safe-haven currencies. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.2810 Swiss francs, from 1.2855 on Tuesday. The dollar was also weaker against the mark, falling to 1.5415 marks, from 1.5435 marks on Tuesday. 
 With a dearth of significant news or economic data to guide the market, currency dealers focused on technical factors. Unconfirmed reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan and other central banks prompted traders betting on a lower dollar to buy dollars, said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Paine Webber Inc. "A nervous market was overextended and forced to cover," he said.
A report that foreign semiconductor makers' share of the Japanese market rose to a record 21.9 percent in the second quarter helped limit pressure to sell dollars for yen, Mr. Flanagan said. So did optimism for a trade agreement between Washington and Tokyo.
Recent signs of progress in trade talks between the United States and Japan, he said, "is keeping the market hopeful that something will be accomplished and the dollar will trade higher."
In New York trading, the dollar rose to 99.21 yen yesterday from 98.85 yen on Tuesday.
Currency traders largely shrugged off a Government report that retail sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in August, a number that was in line with expectations and had little impact on the inflation-sensitive bond market.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Is Brisk

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
After a brief respite, shoppers flocked to stores and showrooms again in August and spent freely for a surprisingly broad range of back-to-school and other consumer goods, Commerce Department figures showed today.
Retail sales, which account for about one-third of the economy, jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $186.56 billion for the month, solidifying expectations that personal spending in the July-September quarter will more than double its second-quarter growth pace of 1.4 percent. That could mean the overall economy may not be slowing as much as the Federal Reserve would like. 
 "The impressive thing is that it was across the board," said L. Douglas Lee, chief economist at NatWest Markets, a Washington investment firm. It is no longer quite as clear as earlier in the summer, he added, that the consumer is throttling back.
Although the retail sales increase in August was well within the range of expectations, the composition was somewhat different in a way some analysts found a bit unsettling. Spending at automotive dealers, though posting a robust 1.2 percent gain, was not as high as predicted, while spending on nondurable goods like groceries and clothing exceeded expectations. Nondurable goods account for about 61 percent of the total, while durable goods make up the remaining 39 percent.
Automotive sales might have been held back because of temporary shortages associated with summer production shutdowns, analysts said. And unlike durable goods, which have traced a saw-toothed pattern since spring, nondurables have now climbed four consecutive months, with July's gain revised upward today.
"There are signs of strength in all major segments except for restaurants," including a 2 percent jump in spending last month at apparel and specialty stores, observed Daniel Seto, economist at Nikko Securities in New York.
Despite the retail vigor, most analysts held to the belief that the Federal Reserve would wait until its November policy meeting, after Election Day, to move short-term interest rates up another notch in its effort to help the economy glide back to a growth rate of about 2.5 percent. During the first half of the year, growth averaged just over 3.5 percent, widely seen as unsustainable without rekindling inflation.
A minority, however, is reassessing this assumption.
"The economy is picking up speed as it rides a tail wind," Brian S. Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson in Chicago, said today after digesting this week's inflation and sales figures. He put the odds of a Fed tightening before mid-November at 50 percent, up from from 10 to 20 percent previously.
In a separate assessment of economic conditions, the Federal Reserve found activity expanding through the summer in most of its districts, with lagging areas "doing better" and the stronger areas now in a "growth plateau."
The central bank's so-called beige book, prepared for the Sept. 27 policy session, described consumer spending as "healthy, albeit decelerating," and merchants' expectations for holiday sales "generally favorable."
The survey, published today, was based on responses before Sept. 6 to Fed inquiries.
The Commerce Department's tally of retail sales, which is adjusted for seasonal and holiday variations but not for price changes, showed sales of durable goods up 1.3 percent in August after falling six-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes rang up a 2.2 percent increase, while those selling furniture and other equipment for the home took in 1.7 percent more revenue than in July.
Among nondurables, which posted an overall gain of four-tenths of 1 percent, the 2 percent jump for apparel was by far the largest. But sales also rose 1 percent at gasoline service stations (aided by price increases), four-tenths of 1 percent at stores selling general merchandise, three-tenths of 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores and two-tenths of 1 percent at food stores.
For restaurants and bars, a nine-tenths of 1 percent drop followed a very strong 1.5 percent burst in July when the World Cup soccer tournament was being played.
"This is quite a good report," said Steven H. Katz, a researcher at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.
Over the June through August period, retail sales were 7.1 percent above the comparable 1993 period, the Commerce Department also reported.
Without seasonal adjustment, sales jumped last month by 3.8 percent, to $193.02 billion from $186.04 billion.

HEADLINE: Japanese Taking to Wide-Screen TV

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
With its once vaunted high-definition television set meeting disappointing acceptance from consumers, Japan has begun moving toward another new system that promises to make home viewing more like going to the movies.
Japanese consumers have been flocking in recent months to buy television sets with wider screens than the conventional boxy ones, heralding what could be a permanent shift in shape of television pictures here and eventually worldwide. 
 Sales of wide-screen televisions in Japan are expected to soar to between 1 million and 1.5 million units this year, from 300,000 sets last year and 44,000 in 1992, the first year of sale. This means that wide-screen units could account for at least one of every eight television sets bought by Japanese this year.
The sales could receive an even bigger lift next year when television stations here begin broadcasting for a wide format. And sales of the new sets are under way in the United States, Europe and Asia.
The screen shape matches that of movie frames, so that films can be shown without clipping off the edges, as happens on conventional TV screens. Proponents say the wider picture fills the field of vision more completely, giving the viewer a sense of being on the sidelines of a sporting event.
"It's more natural" for human eyes to view a wide scene, said Tadao Kubodera, general manager of the Japan TV department for the Sony Corporation.
The new sets are best when used with wide-format broadcasts or videocassettes. They can also handle conventional broadcasts or tapes by stretching the picture across the screen, distorting it a bit.
Yoichi Morishita, the president of Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, predicted that wide-screen television sets would eventually become commonplace in the home. Executives of the Sanyo Electric Company forecast that 15 percent of Japanese homes would have wide-screen television sets by the end of this year, with penetration rising to 80 percent by the year 2000.
The prices for wide-screen sets here range from about $600 for a small, basic model to $4,000 for a large, deluxe model, while high-definition sets still cost over $6,000. With an adapter, wide-screen sets can receive high-definition broadcasts, but with only normal resolution.
The boom in "wy-doh terebi," as wide-screen television is called here, has cheered Japan's consumer electronics companies, which have been suffering from an economic slump, maturing markets and a dearth of popular new products.
Mr. Morishita and other executives said that wide-screen television would not be the blockbuster that alone could rescue the electronics industry. It is an improvement on existing television sets, but not a new product as the videocassette recorder was. But wide-screen television is one of several potentially profitable new products, along with the mini-disk audio system and the car navigation system.
The spreading popularity of wide-screen television could hammer another nail in the coffin of Japan's high-definition television, which has failed to catch on because of high prices and a shortage of programming. Many industry experts feel that Japan's HDTV system also faces a limited future technologically because it uses an older analog transmission system, rather than the computer-like digital technology being developed in the United States.
High-definition television offers both a wider picture than existing sets and an image that is twice as sharp. But the popularity of wide-screen television suggests that consumers might be satisfied with the wider picture alone and unwilling to pay more for higher resolution.
"That's a very big problem," said Masayuki Uematsu, a manager in video product development for Hitachi Ltd.
Other industry executives argue that wide-screen television will only whet the appetite of consumers for the high-definition format. "Eventually, HDTV sales will surpass wide television," said Shoji Inatsugu, business group executive in charge of television for Matsushita, best known for its Panasonic brand.
That, he conceded, will take a long time. Last year, only 10,000 HDTV sets were sold in Japan, compared with 8 million or more conventional sets. A total of 130,000 high-definition sets have been sold since high-definition broadcasting began in the late 1980's. Matsushita itself has sold 8,400 high-definition sets and 150,000 wide-screen ones.
In the United States, wide-screen television sets are available from two European manufacturers, Thomson Consumer Electronics and Philips N.V. In May, the Sharp Corporation became the first Japanese company to sell such sets in the United States, offering a 34-inch model with a list price of $4,000, about twice the price of a regular 35-inch set. Some other Japanese companies sell wide-screen projection television sets.
But only about 5,000 high-definition sets of all makes have been sold in the United States so far this year, Jon Lezon, product marketing manager for television sets at Sharp Electronics in Mahwah, N.J., estimated. "The software is just not there," Mr. Lezon said.
One reason wide-screen television has not caught on in the United States is that projection television, even without a wide screen, has fulfilled the need for cinema-like viewing at home. Projection television has not been as popular in Japan, where homes are smaller.
Another problem in the United States, Mr. Lezon of Sharp said, is that only about 100 pre-recorded videotape titles and 800 laser disk titles have been made for wide-screen television, far fewer than in Japan. Only DirecTV, a California-based direct broadcast satellite service of Hughes Electronics, offers wide-format television programming to American viewers.
Sony, which has introduced a video camera in the wide format, is also promoting wide-screen television for playing video games. The wide screens stretch the video image so the game characters cover more ground and seem to move faster across the screen.
The ratio of the width to the length of the wide screens is 16 to 9, a third wider than the 4-to-3 aspect ratio of conventional television sets.
When the wide-television sets are used to watch conventional broadcasts or videos, the picture expands to fill the wider screen. Like a picture drawn on a rubber band, everything in it becomes a little fatter.
Another method leaves the center of the image alone so it is free of distortion and stretches out the edges, creating more severe distortion at the sides. This might work best for shows like newscasts, where the viewer's attention is concentrated on the mid-screen.
Yet another method is to expand the 4-by-3 picture until the picture fills up the screen horizontally. This avoids distortion but means losing the top or bottom of the original picture. Sony's television set squeezes the top and bottom of the picture to avoid cropping it.
Next year Japanese television stations will begin broadcasts designed for wide-screen televisions. The system, known as EDTV-2 or enhanced definition television, will provide better quality pictures than conventional television, although not so good as high-definition television..
EDTV-2 is compatible with the existing television system, but wide-screen television sets now sold in Japan require a special decoder to receive the higher picture quality.
Such enhanced definition television, an intermediate step toward high-definition television, is also being developed in Europe. But American engineers are going directly to digital high-definition television.

With the remainder of the baseball season canceled, two Senators are still hoping to pass a floor amendment, tacked on to other legislation, that would remove part of baseball's antitrust exemption should the club owners decide to unilaterally impose new labor conditions.
If the amendment is passed, Donald Fehr, the baseball union leader, has indicated to Senator Howard Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, that he would recommend that players end the strike, Metzenbaum said. The floor amendment is co-sponsored by Metzenbaum and Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah. 
 Despite the cancellation of the season, Metzenbaum said if the amendment was passed early next week, he thought there still might be baseball played this season. "Maybe that's wishful thinking on my part, I don't know if it's probable," Metzenbaum said. "The owners are very proud of themselves for having shut down the season. It indicates their power, but not their good judgment."
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted down a bill in June that would have brought baseball's labor relations under the antitrust law. Among other things, such as control over the movement of franchises, the exemption allows the owners to impose new labor conditions in the event of an impasse in collective bargaining and not be subject to legal challenge that it is anticompetitive.
The Metzenbaum-Hatch amendment is an attempt to focus on that situation and the one that created the strike, the owners' demand for cost certainty by placing a limit on player payrolls. The owners could unilaterally impose a salary cap for next season. Under the amendment, the players could challenge the move in court.
"There is an imbalance between the owners and the players and this amendment would even up the bargaining positions of the two parties," Metzenbaum said. "In the current context, this would allow players to take owners to court and challenge a salary cap as collusion to restrain trade. It should be before the court rather than on the picket line."
Metzenbaum said he was "fairly sure" he would be able to find legislation he could attach the amendment to next week. He also said he thought he had enough support to pass the amendment.
In the House, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas, has scheduled a hearing of the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law on Sept. 22 to discuss the antitrust exemption.
President Clinton said today that although he had not had time to study the issue in detail or to seek advice on it from the Justice Department that if baseball has "just turned into another business in America" then the antitrust exemption was an issue that needed to be examined.
"I don't see how we can avoid a serious examination of it in light of what has happened now to the American people," he said, lamenting the end of what he called "what could have been the best baseball season in 50 years."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: THE IMPACT;
A Cash Cow Transforms Itself Into a Dead Horse

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Baseball's labor mess is a case study in dreadful marketing. The 34-day-old players' strike, compounded yesterday by the cancellation of the remainder of the season, has transformed a monthlong blunder into a disaster.
"I'd give it Hall of Fame status for bad decisions," said Jack Trout, a marketing strategist with the Trout & Ries firm in Greenwich, Conn. "It's a classic. Up there with New Coke and Edsel." 
 The losses transcend the owners' losing revenues of about $442 million for a season that will end 52 days and 669 games early, or players losing $229 million in salaries. Or the revenues and pay from playoff and World Series play.
It goes beyond the 30 layoffs of Mets ticket and clubhouse staff, similar layoffs by the Yankees and early joblessness for thousands of ushers, ticket takers, security workers and vendors at both Shea and Yankee stadiums.
"The strike creates a real feeling of helplessness," said Leigh Steinberg, a player agent.
The impact will be felt in the tarnished image of major league baseball, which will lose further ground to more stable, better marketed sports such as football, basketball and hockey. "Baseball will never get some of its advertisers back," said Marty Blackman, an advertising and marketing consultant. "They'll find other places to put their money."
The impact will be felt by local and network TV, manufacturers of athletic merchandise, retailers, cities, charities and baseball card makers.
"I'd say it's hurt us by $7 million to $10 million in post-season business" said Tom Shine, the president of Logo 7, the Indianapolis-based athletic apparel maker. "Baseball will lose its share in the marketplace. Baseball has become the weak link in the chain of sports."
A person familiar with business at Major League Baseball Properties said its licensed product sales are down 23 percent because of the strike and the lack of leadership atop the properties division, which has been without a president since last winter. Many retailers have stopped accepting shipments of licensed baseball goods and won't accept other sports' merchandise until manufacturers take baseball goods back. Spring orders are in jeopardy.
"Retailers are feeling that baseball is tough to sell," said Marianne Bhonslay, editor of Team Leader, a trade magazine. "They're putting money into other sports that support their product better than baseball does."
Ian Gomar, vice president of marketing for New Haven, Conn.-based Starter, the headwear and outerwear manufacturer, said: "Look at all my concession business. It's gone. People aren't going to the ball parks."
Gerry Cosby's, the sporting goods store at Madison Square Garden, figured players would strike and heavily reduced its baseball inventory. "We believed apathy had set in and with the strike on the front burner, we cut our stock 50 percent," said Jim Root, a vice president. "We're lucky. We could have been dying if they'd settled early."
The financial noose is tightening at The Baseball Network, the joint venture of baseball, NBC and ABC. It will lose about $24 million from unplayed regular-season games, perhaps $30 million from strong prime-time advertising spending for September and October, and another $100 million from the scrubbing of the playoffs and World Series. "Opportunities for money have passed us by," said Mike Trager, TBN's executive vice president.
The end of 1994 baseball means TBN will have logged sales of $30 million and needs $300 million next year to meet its two-year renewal target.
TBN had lured numerous sponsors, ranging from Anheuser-Busch to Gillette.
"If there's no baseball," said Eric Kraus, a Gillette spokesman, "we'll evaluate the viability of The Baseball Network. We advertised with them anticipating baseball." A Gillette promotion with consumers trying to slug homers in playoff and World Series stadiums will be done in an empty ball park.
Steve Disson, president of the D & F Group, a marketing consultant, said, "Companies we've had who've sponsored baseball locally are gun-shy about doing it nationally, like the United States Postal Service."
In local TV, the MSG Network and SportsChannel, the cable homes of the Yankees and the Mets, have not yet toted up their losses. On one side of the ledger, they don't have to pay the rights fees ($300,000 per Yankee game and $150,000 per Mets game). But they've lost ad sales and cable system fees.
Doug Moss, MSG's president, said, "We make money on Yankees games."
In other areas:
*New York City estimates that each Yankees and Mets home game generates about $2 million in economic impact. Losing 26 Mets' and 24 Yankees' games would reduce the impact by about $100 million, from ticket sales, concessions, hotels, restaurants, taxis, parking, luxury boxes and subway fares. According to a survey of 22 teams by the United States Conference of Mayors, an average $1.16 million in economic activity is lost per game, and an average of 1,250 full- and part-time workers have been idled by the strike.
*Baseball card sales will probably suffer, starting with update sets that would have been released about now. "My feeling is the update market is dead," said Tom Mortensen, editor of Sports Collectors Digest.
*Charitable contributions based on player performance will be hurt. Although Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants will still make contributions to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, "charities lose the benefit of fans inspired by players to contribute money," said Steinberg, Williams's agent.
*Baseballs made by Rawlings -- 96 per game, or 64,224 for each of the regular-season games missed -- will not be used, said Scott Smith, a company spokesman. "Those balls are sold but maybe we'll have that many fewer orders for next season," he said. World Series balls, which are sold in the two cities, will languish in Rawlings's warehouse.
*About one-quarter of the 80,000 bats that Hillerich-Bradsby manufactures for major league players have not been shipped. "Orders for next year's bats usually come in as early as November and December," said Bill Williams, the batmaker's spokesman. "If this thing's not settled, will the equipment managers be calling us with orders?"

Biggest Loss For Baseball: Do You Care?

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
EVEN before the baseball season was proclaimed dull and void by Bud Selig yesterday, some people's reaction had been clear.
"I don't care," you heard more and more people saying. 
 Of all the sad words about the absence of a World Series this year, the most painful are "I don't care," because those same people had once cared about baseball.
Cared if their team won or lost. Cared if it were in first place or in last place. Cared when it signed a free agent. Cared when it made a trade. Cared when a hot rookie suddenly arrived. Cared when it changed managers.
But many of those same people no longer seem to care. Or say they don't. And that's baseball's biggest loss.
When the ballplayers go back to work, whenever that is, many of those same people suddenly will care again. But maybe not as much as they once did. And some might never care again.
It's like lovers who quarrel. After too many of those quarrels, maybe you decide not see each other anymore.
It's the same for all those people saying, "I don't care." Especially if there's no World Series to watch.
Until now they could depend on the World Series always being there. To them, the Fall Classic has been a weeklong religious experience in October even if their favorite team wasn't in it.
But if a labor dispute can delete one World Series, future disputes could delete two or three more.
Maybe the Yankees would have won this year's World Series on a Don Mattingly home run, but now you'll never know.
All those people who are saying, "I don't care" really mean they don't trust baseball anymore.
Trust it to be there when it's supposed to be.
Trust it for what it promotes itself as: "The National Pastime."
Trust it to punctuate its season with the usual World Series exclamation point.
Maybe the Montreal Expos would have kept the World Series trophy in Canada, but now you'll never know.
By undermining the public's trust in a World Series, the 28 major league club owners have also undermined their antitrust exemption.
Several Congressional voices are shouting, rightfully, that baseball no longer deserves the antitrust exemption that has prevented litigation by the players' union.
Baseball was granted its exemption in 1922 by the United States Supreme Court. But in 1972, when the Supreme Court rejected Curt Flood's bid for free agency, Justice Harry Blackmun described the exemption as an "anomaly," an "aberration" and suggested that "it be remedied by Congress," not by the Supreme Court.
Now that the remainder of the season and the entire post-season has been canceled, the club owners are expected to impose their last contract offer as baseball's new economic system, like it or not. But if the owners' antitrust exemption is revoked, the union could take the owners' system to court.
Maybe the Atlanta Braves finally would have won the World Series after three years of frustration, but now you'll never know.
Dreamers talk of organizing a Third League, of suddenly signing free agents for the 1995 season. Yes, some players would be available. But with the current teams owning or leasing all the major league stadiums, where would the Third League teams play? It's not as if other acceptable stadiums are out there waiting for new tenants.
Maybe the Cleveland Indians would have emerged as the first wild-card World Series champion, but now you'll never know.
For all those people who profess, "I don't care," there are just as many, if not more, who do care. But they will survive.
Except for the few whose employment is attached to the teams or the stadiums, it's not as if the shutdown of the baseball industry (don't call it a game) directly affects the lives of those who do care.
Those who do care will get through the last two weeks of September without any pennant races. They will get through October without the Fall Classic.
When they do, maybe then they will realize they also don't care anymore.

HEADLINE: An Encouraging Signal From Quebec

 BODY:
The narrowness of the popular vote that has restored the separatist party to power in Quebec is heartening news for North America. Splitting Canada in two would be wrong, but the vote count suggests Quebecers are not ready to do it. For the U.S., and for continental stability, it is a reassuring indication that our northern neighbor -- closest ally, biggest trading partner and best friend -- will continue to be all of those things.
The victory of the separatist Parti Quebecois was expected. The party will have a solid majority in the provincial parliament, but pre-election polls predicted it would be significantly larger. Moreover, the separatists' failure to win 50 percent of the popular vote, and their slim margin over the Liberal candidates -- less than one-half of 1 percent -- say voters are less than enthusiastic about their new government's aim to create a sovereign nation. Indeed, the Liberals' defeat had more to do with high unemployment and low regard for the party after nine years in office. 
 The United States has political, economic and neighborly interests in keeping Canada whole, as well as a desire to avoid the chaotic unknown. As a global superpower, America wants stability on its borders, not neighbors engaged in a testy divorce. Considering also that the U.S. and Canada are each other's and the world's largest trading partners, the value and reliability of this relationship is far preferable to the barriers likely to rise in the wake of a split. Finally, long-term friendship says that if the great majority of Canadians prefer unity, which they do, the United States should support them.
Canada has been through several Quebec crises already and, alas, this one may not be the last. Jacques Parizeau, the Parti Quebecois leader, promises a referendum on sovereignty next year. But even if the majority vote to stay in Canada, as they have before, the cultural split between English Canada and the French in Quebec will not fade away. It is part of Canada -- a humane, multicultural society, albeit sometimes quarrelsome.
Meanwhile, one way or another, Mr. Parizeau promises to stir up trouble with the Federal Government in Ottawa. On matters where provincial cooperation is called for, such as social reforms, he says Quebec will refuse to participate. On local matters, he has ideas for public projects to cut unemployment and prove that his government is better than Ottawa's.
On sovereignty, the party has laid out three steps: an immediate parliamentary resolution saying Quebec should split, even before a referendum to determine the popular will; preparation of a new constitution, a huge task itself, and negotiations with Ottawa on arrangements for separation, which Ottawa would surely reject before a referendum and would fight if the referendum carried.
All three steps looked less certain the morning after the election, but this battle is far from over. In power, the Parti Quebecois may yet convince the majority of Quebecers they would be better off as a nation apart. That would be unfortunate for all concerned, including their neighbor to the south.

HEADLINE: Zoning, Sex and Videotape

 BODY:
With his stringent proposals to curb New York City's sex-oriented adult entertainment business, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is operating on his campaign pledge to improve the quality of life in city neighborhoods.
His plan to regulate the location and concentration of adult video stores, topless bars and other such establishments is a response to legitimate community anger. That anger has grown as these businesses have spread into residential areas from Rego Park in Queens to Manhattan's Upper East Side, provoking realistic concerns about neighborhood ambiance, property values and crime. 
 Mr. Giuliani's basic approach of using the city's zoning authority to control the number and locations of these shops is sound. Indeed, his multi-faceted plan incorporates several strategies that have worked and won court approval elsewhere. Yet the Mayor's proposal for exiling the bars and shops to a few isolated industrial districts may go too far in limiting legal businesses that cater to a varied clientele and are also forms of free expression, with claims to First Amendment protection.
The city's present zoning laws treat adult businesses like any other businesses, allowing them to open in areas zoned for commercial or manufacturing uses. But both the New York City Planning Commission and the Times Square Business Improvement District, of which this newspaper is a member, cite evidence that such establishments can discourage economic growth, lower property values and exacerbate crime.
In a variety of rulings, courts at several levels have permitted municipalities to impose limitations through zoning upon proof of such harmful economic and public safety effects. However, there is an important caveat: The zoning rules must not unreasonably restrict accessibility. Also, courts have long held that sexually explicit videos, books and dancing are forms of constitutionally protected free speech, and zoning laws must be carefully drawn.
Like similar legislative proposals in the City Council, Mr. Giuliani's plan would bar adult businesses from opening in a residential area. But the Mayor takes a much stricter tack by including in his total ban not just purely residential districts but also "mixed-use" areas that are zoned for both commercial and residential use.
In effect, sex-oriented businesses would be banned from even heavily commercial areas and be pushed to the city's industrial fringes. Even there, such establishments would be prohibited from opening within 500 feet of residences, schools, houses of worship or one another -- a sensible dispersal strategy to avoid turning the city's industrial sections into unappealing "combat zones."
Some details remain fuzzy. It is unclear precisely how the Mayor would phase out existing adult stores and theaters in newly restricted areas once an owner has recouped his or her investment. Such matters remain to be clarified during the upcoming land-use review process. Meanwhile, the City Planning Commission understandably seeks a one-year moratorium on new adult establishments.
Translating Mr. Giuliani's policy into zoning changes will not be easy. The last serious effort to limit adult entertainment in New York City, in 1977, died largely because of objections from the neighborhoods where sex-oriented businesses would still be allowed. Right now there is strong support for the Mayor's initiative in the City Council, which must approve the final zoning plan. But that support could erode if, to make the plan constitutionally safer, it is revised to allow sex-oriented businesses in mixed-use areas. One compromise might be to permit them only if spaced, say, 1,000 feet, or about five blocks, apart to avoid a harmful concentration.
Mr. Giuliani's initiative now challenges the Planning Commission to devise zoning that is fair to free expression and considerate of the public.

Showdown Ahead

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After the President has addressed the nation about his need to make good on his stream of threats to the Haitian junta; after partisans in Congress do their mutual somersaults on the War Powers Act; after we hail a victory over a pipsqueak principality in a war of nerves or forces -- then a real foreign-policy crisis will have to be faced.
The Bosnian clock now stands at one month to midnight. Being put to the test is the credibility of NATO and the strength of the new relationship between the U.S. and Russia. 
 Much good diplomatic work has been done. The U.S. brokered the renewal of the alliance between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats to strike a balance of power and a division of territory with the Bosnian Serbs. After a shaky start, the marriage is solidifying, which shores up the victims of Serbian aggression.
Meanwhile, the economic squeeze put on Belgrade has had the desired effect of splitting the Serbs. Belgrade is now willing to accept monitors to watch Serbia cut off aid to its rogue compatriots in Bosnia, in return for a U.N. lifting of sanctions against Serbia. That isolates the local aggressors.
The only trouble: It's not working. The Bos-Serbs refuse to accept the peace deal that the U.N. persuaded their victims to swallow. They snipe at civilians, murder U.N. soldiers and threaten to shoot down the Pope's plane if he visits besieged Sarajevo. Their goal is never to compromise but to conquer and "cleanse."
Thus has the world learned that the way to make peace with the Bos-serbs is to put guns to their heads. But the U.N. has embargoed the sale of guns to Bosnians. That leaves the well-armed aggressors with the firepower advantage.
President Clinton has been unable to persuade the British and French, who have peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, to lift the embargo and even up the power balance. They prefer to dither than to hunker down or get out; in effect, they are "protecting" the Muslims out of their country.
Clinton's impotence with our allies led the Senate to propose -- and the President to embrace in an Aug. 10 letter to Sam Nunn -- an ultimatum with a deadline. "If the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the contact group's proposal of July 6, 1994 . . . by October 15, 1994," reads the Senate's amendment to the defense appropriation bill, not yet voted on by the House, "the President . . . should formally introduce and support a resolution in the U.N. Security Council . . . to terminate the international arms embargo. . . ."
If that U.S. proposal is vetoed, says the Senate, the President should submit a plan to lift the embargo by ourselves; Clinton's letter would not go beyond pledging to seek a vote on "multilateral termination" of the embargo.
The clock has been ticking. On Sept. 28, Boris Yeltsin arrives for his fifth Clinton summit. That meeting's success depends on Clinton's ability to persuade the Russian President to support the U.S. resolution to arm the Bosnian defenders.
The two have worked well together before: Clinton helped Yeltsin make a deal with Ukraine to give up its nukes, and the Russian kept his word to pull troops out of the Baltics. Moscow has been helpful with Belgrade; now comes the crunch.
A New York Times editorial suggests linking the lifting of economic sanctions on Belgrade to the lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia. Good idea; that would enable the Russians to go along, and put the issue to Britain's John Major and France's Eduard Balladur: Who wants to veto the U.S. resolution?
Such a veto would split the Atlantic Alliance, invite a radical drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe and undermine what would be left of NATO after its failure in Bosnia.
That would be an isolationist's dream, brought about by the intransigence of the Bos-Serbs compounded by the shortsightedness of Major and Balladur. But the British and French are not so foolish; they'll vote with us and withdraw their peacekeepers, selling the Bosnians their on-site equipment.
If Clinton is steadfast -- rejecting the defeatist counsel of General Shilly-shally and the C.I.A. -- he can bring along the allies and level the field of fire in Bosnia. Success in such high-stakes diplomacy would be remembered long after the brouhaha in Haiti is forgotten.

HEADLINE: CUNY's Open Admissions Fail Miserably;
Setting Priorities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Two and a half cheers for "The Trashing of CUNY" (Op-Ed, Sept. 8) by Blanche Wiesen Cook and Sandi E. Cooper, their eloquent reply to Heather Mac Donald's misguided attack in the City Journal. 
 My only reservation is the contentions about "Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds's reorganization plan," the academic program planning begun two years ago to improve the link between resources and student needs and to insure quality in a difficult fiscal climate.
The goal was never to impose a single profile of academic programs on CUNY or to reorganize the system of colleges, but to stimulate campus-level planning and priority-setting when city and state resources were severely curtailed and enrollment was soaring.
Some colleges received additional resources in professional and career fields like physical therapy and nursing, for which employer and student demand far exceeded the university's capacity to supply trained graduates. But that expansion did not occur at the expense of the liberal arts and sciences, which remain central to all higher education at CUNY.
As a result, CUNY hired 59 full-time faculty members from redeployed resources in 1993-94. Forty of those were in the liberal arts and sciences, including philosophy, history, Spanish, English, economics and sociology at City College; and biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics at Bronx Community College. Academic program planning continues to strengthen the mix of higher learning CUNY has offered New Yorkers for the last century and a half.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Climb; 'Beige Book' Stirs Hope

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were slightly higher yesterday after two economic reports met the market's expectations.
Trading was slowed by a computer glitch at the Chicago Board of Trade, where trading in bonds futures contracts was halted for nearly four hours. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 1/16 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.67 percent, from 7.68 percent on Tuesday.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales surged eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $186.56 billion for August. Despite the strong showing, analysts still see little reason for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before its November policy meeting.
A report by the Fed, its so-called beige book survey of economic conditions, said that competition among companies was keeping retail price increases subdued as the economy slowly expanded.
"There's reason for optimism that inflation is not going to accelerate dramatically," said Steven Nothern, who manages $3.5 billion at Massachusetts Financial Services. Even so, "the inflation process is starting to move in fits and starts through the pipeline," he said.
Fed policy makers will consider the beige book report in deciding whether to push interest rates higher at their Sept. 27 meeting. The report suggests the Fed will not raise rates again until November, said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International (America).
"We have seen a cyclical change in inflation," Mr. Strauss said. "Is it dramatic? No."
The Government reported on Tuesday that consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in August, matching increases in June and July. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was at a 2.9 percent annual rate through August, up from 2.8 percent for the first eight months of last year and 2.7 percent for all of last year.
In its survey, the Fed said wage inflation was possible amid "more reports of tightening labor markets than before, though wage pressures are still described as modest."
Today, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is scheduled to report on prices paid by 150 manufacturers in Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey. Bonds tumbled after last month's Philadelphia Fed report, which said the bank's prices-paid index surged to a five-year high.
In the corporate bond market, seven businesses sold a total of $1.78 billion in bonds yesterday.
The Nissan Motor Company sold $642 million in bonds. First National Bank of Boston, a unit of the New England bank holding company the Bank of Boston Corporation, sold $200 million of 10-year notes. Bear Stearns Companies sold $200 million of five-year notes.
Other sales included a $175 million offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Government-owned utility, and an $80 million sale by the Michigan Gas Corporation. TCI Communications Inc., a unit of Tele-Communications Inc., sold $300 million of 10-year debt. Chevy Chase Savings Bank sold $181.9 million of floating-rate securities backed by home equity loans, according to MCM Corporate Watch.
Bonds backed by mortgages of the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, led mortgage-backed securities higher, following news of programs that will make the securities easier to trade.
Ginnie Mae 8 percent pass- throughs for October delivery rose as much as 1/4, to 985/32 , to yield 8.41 percent, three basis points less than yesterday. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Ginnie Mae and the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, said yesterday that they would begin bundling mortgage-backed bonds for investors.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN HAITI: AT THE WHITE HOUSE;
CLINTON ADDRESSES NATION ON THREAT TO INVADE HAITI; TELLS DICTATORS TO GET OUT

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Appearing on national television to prepare the country for an invasion of Haiti, President Clinton said tonight that he had exhausted diplomacy and was ready to send in ground troops to force out a military leadership that he blamed for a series of atrocities.
"The message of the United States to the Haitian dictators is clear," Mr. Clinton declared in the 9 P.M. address from the Oval Office. "Your time is up. Leave now or we will force you from power." [Transcript, page A10.] 
 The President did not set a specific deadline for the Haitian leaders to flee, but he said it would be wrong to wait much longer to overthrow the troika that seized power from the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected President, nearly three years ago.
With lead elements of a 20,000-member invasion force already on warships heading for Haiti's shores, Administration officials said Mr. Clinton would be prepared to order an invasion by early next week.
Mr. Clinton used tonight's speech to present a primer-like history of a standoff that has frustrated Washington since October 1991. As the United States tried negotiation, then a United Nations accord and finally an economically crippling embargo to restore Father Aristide to office, the President said, the ruling junta remained intransigent, maintaining its grasp with a wave of violence that left countless Haitians brutalized and repressed.
"The nations of the world have tried every possible way to restore Haiti's democratic Government peacefully," Mr. Clinton said. "The dictators have rejected every possible solution. The terror, the desperation, and the instability will not end until they leave."
Mr. Clinton said he was ready to dispatch troops in a two-phase operation but promised that the main invasion force would return to the United States "in months, not years." He said their task would be to restore security to Haiti, in part by training a new police force, so that the United Nations force that replaces it -- with a far smaller proportion of Americans -- could concentrate on maintaining peace and on helping to rebuild democratic institutions.
"They can still move now and reduce the chaos and disorder, increase the security, the stability and the safety in which this transfer back to democracy can occur," Mr. Clinton said of the Haitian leaders. "But if they do not leave now, the international community will act to honor our commitments to give democracy a chance, not to guarantee it; to remove stubborn and cruel dictators, not to impose a future."
But it was evident tonight that the address left many in Congress unconvinced that such an operation was necessary, with many Democrats as adamant as Republicans that Mr. Clinton had not made his case. [Page A11.]
Even as he spoke, the Administration prepared a last-ditch offer to induce the Haitian junta to step down, in hopes that Mr. Clinton could still achieve a diplomatic solution and thus be able to avoid an invasion that already faces strong Congressional opposition and which the President's advisers fear will prove equally unpopular with voters.
Tonight's address was the first that Mr. Clinton has ever devoted to the subject of Haiti, and it came amid mounting criticism from Congress that he had waited too long and done too little to steel the public for the prospect that American lives could soon be at risk.
Throughout the day, White House aides were struggling to avert a vote in Congress next week against an invasion. Even if the Haitian military leaders step aside, the President is committed to sending thousands of soldiers and marines into Haiti to restore Father Aristide to power. But the Administration would much rather send those troops onto beaches where they would face no resistance than into combat with a hostile military force whose leaders today threatened a bloody civil war.
Having threatened for months to use force in Haiti, Mr. Clinton warned tonight that to back away from those threats would strip the United States of its credibility now and in the future as it confronts other intransigent leaders abroad.
He offered a careful justification for military action. To permit Haiti's coup leaders to remain in place, he declared, would be to acquiesce in brutal violations of human rights, to endanger fragile democracies elsewhere in the hemisphere, and to risk the renewal -- at a tremendous cost to American taxpayers -- of a flow of tens of thousands of desperate Haitians toward American shores.
"If we don't act," Mr. Clinton said, "they could be the next wave of refugees at our door."
The President painted a gruesome picture of human rights violations under military rule in Haiti, headed by Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras.
"Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign of terror," Mr. Clinton said. "Executing children. Raping women. Killing priests. As the dictators have grown more desperate, the atrocities have grown ever more brutal."
Mr. Clinton showed no sign of willingness to entertain calls from both parties in Congress that he hold off any invasion until he could win Congressional approval. But he did try to offer some comfort to Haitians and Americans who have questioned the wisdom of an American policy intended to restore Father Aristide to power, saying the Haitian President had promised to relinquish his office after his term expires early in 1996, even though he has served nearly all of that term in exile.
Several times tonight, Mr. Clinton sought to emphasize that the will to restore democracy to Haiti was shared by other nations as well as the United States. But while the Pentagon today mobilized 1,600 reservists to join in an American-led invasion force of about 20,000 ground troops, fewer than 1,000 soldiers from other countries would take part in the operation, most in its later stages.
If the three leaders do flee, Mr. Clinton still intends to send a powerful but perhaps scaled-back American-led military force to Haiti, a move he said tonight would be intended to restore security there as a first step toward rebuilding the country's democratic institutions.
William J. Perry, the Defense Secretary, told reporters today that the United States stood ready to provide safe passage to a comfortable life in exile for General Cedras and his two top associates -- Lieut. Col. Michel Francois, the police commander, and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, the chief of staff -- if they would give up power.
Other Administration officials said that if the three military leaders signal a willingness to step down, they could be presented in coming days with a secret offer outlining the terms of such a deal by an official from the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince, most likely the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief.
A covert program approved by Mr. Clinton earlier this month to try to arrange for the peaceful departure of the three leaders provides for up to $12 million, part of it to help the C.I.A. conduct clandestine activities to help undermine the military leadership. A substantial amount of the money could go to the three men as an inducement to leave, including a total of millions of dollars in payoffs, senior officials said.
While Mr. Perry today described indications of "a fair amount of turmoil" in the junta, White House officials said tonight that they still had seen no indication that the Haitian leaders were ready to leave. They said they could not accept a deal mentioned by Edward P. G. Seaga, a former Jamaican Prime Minister, who has told the Administration that General Cedras would be willing to resign if the military-installed Government led by the provisional President, Emil Jonaissant, could remain in power.
If the three Haitian leaders reject an American offer, Administration officials said, William Swing, the United States Ambassador to Haiti, has been authorized to deliver personal ultimatums to General Cedras, General Biamby and Colonel Francois.
In announcing that Father Aristide had pledged to step down when his term expires in February 1996, Mr. Clinton revealed that the Administration had resolved an issue that had caused uneasiness even in the White House.
If Father Aristide had tried after returning to power to make up for his time in exile, his term could have been extended by three years, a prospect that has alarmed Haitians who do not support him. But Administration officials said Father Aristide had pledged in writing in a meeting on Tuesday with Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, to adhere to his country's Constitution, adding that he looked forward to handing over power to someone else in February 1996.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton praised that promise as an "historic example" in which a Haitian leader would join for the first time in "peacefully transferring power to a duly elected successor."
This evening, there were recriminations within the Administration that he had not acted sooner to confront Haiti's military leaders after they rejected the Governors Island accord calling for them to step down.
What particularly emboldened those leaders, some officials say, was the President's decision last October to order back the Harlan County, an American amphibious transport ship, after a group of military-backed Haitian protesters prevented it from docking in Port-au-Prince. The ship was carrying an American-led contingent of peacekeeping troops sent to prepare for Father Aristide's return under the United Nations-brokered accord.
Publicly, however, the President and his aides were careful to cast the Haitian issue as an American problem rather than just a Clinton Administration problem. Mr. Clinton noted that even President Bush had denounced the overthrow of President Aristide as "an extraordinary threat" to American security, but he did not mention that Mr. Bush had ruled out any intervention.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN HAITI: IN PERSPECTIVE;
Preaching to Skeptics

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton spoke tonight into the teeth of a howling political gale.
As the Pentagon mobilized reserve units and American warships steamed toward Haiti, the President belatedly set his full rationale for an invasion before the nation in a televised attempt to rally public support for imminent military action. But he addressed a nation of skeptics. 
 According to the latest polls, about two-thirds of the electorate oppose any military solution. Republicans on Capitol Hill are also opposed, and so are many important Democrats, including some members of the Black Caucus, whose leaders have pressed so long and so hard for the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The President is not seeking the approval of Congress because he knows that he could not get it.
"The politics of this are not good," said Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democratic nose-counter and a Clinton loyalist.
Mr. Clinton is one of the most skillful of modern Presidents in stating his case, and he did so effectively tonight. Nonetheless, his speech came after months of notably unsteady policy-making on Haiti, and some wondered whether the President's underlying motive was the preservation of his own credibility after threatening military action so often.
Blending elements of the Monroe Doctrine and the Truman Doctrine, Mr. Clinton argued that if General Raoul Cedras refuses to yield power, the United States would have no choice but to invade to protect its interests, "to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians, to secure our borders, and to preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere, and to uphold the reliability of the commitments we make and the commitments others make to us."
 In fact, most Americans doubt that Haiti is a real test case of their national resolve. The questions spring readily to people's lips: Why invade Haiti in an effort to implant democracy in soil where it has never flourished, any more than invade Cuba in an attempt to cultivate democracy there? Why suddenly choose Haiti as the place where the United States will act to stop atrocity, loathesome as it undoubtedly is, when atrocity is and long has been a part of life in many countries near and far?
More may be swayed by Mr. Clinton's unusually blunt appeal to economic self-interest and fears of uncontrolled immigration. Unless the United States acts, he said, the 300,000 Haitians now in hiding "will be the next wave of refugees at our door," with attendant high costs.
But there was a certain grim spirit within the Administration today, as if it had set itself upon a course that it did not know how to abandon, however perilous the waters ahead look.
Many Democrats who are seeking re-election this fall have called the White House in the last 48 hours to say that an invasion would further damage already slim chances.
Three Democratic senators said Tuesday in floor speeches that they thought Mr. Clinton was making a big mistake. The three -- Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, Jim Sasser of Tennessee and Sam Nunn of Georgia -- represent the liberal, moderate and conservative strains in their party, and all suggested that Mr. Clinton had failed to convince the nation of the need to invade.
Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, has sought to calm their fears and those of other Democrats by telling them that once combat is joined the nation will rally behind the President. That is no doubt true. It has happened again and again in recent years, notably during the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991.
But as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney conceded at the time, a more prolonged conflict or heavy American casualties, which never materialized, would probably have seriously weakened public support.
That happened in Somalia, when televised pictures of a dead American soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu at the end of a rope brought a national outcry. American participation in nation-building was sharply curtailed, and today, by coincidence, the last 80 American diplomats and marines left the country, with the warlords still firmly in control there.
The Forum for International Policy, headed by Brent Scowcroft, who was President George Bush's national security adviser, said today:
"While an invasion would in itself be a relatively simple operation, the aftermath would not be. In contemplating an invasion followed by nation-building, we should all keep Somalia in mind. Pacification would be a complicated, hazardous and grueling process, and nation-building would almost certainly be an extremely difficult task of indeterminate length."
Mr. Clinton hopes, of course, that things will go better than that. But his Defense Secretary, William Perry, warned today that casualties could be expected, despite the comic-opera weakness of the Haitian army, and Pentagon officials worry about the possibility of a bloody campaign of reprisal aganst Aristide backers followed by a guerilla war.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle and a few other Republicans have suggested that the White House is hoping to get a bounce in the polls if the invasion is a success. That seems unlikely, because the Administration's strategists have seen too much evidence to the contrary in the recent past.
Prof. George C. Edwards 3d, director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&M University, notes in the Sept. 26 issue of The Polling Report that Mr. Clinton benefitted once before from a burst of patriotic fervor. That was when he sent Tomahawk cruise missiles against Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad on June 26 last year. His approval ratings jumped about 15 points, but by August they were back where they started.
Likewise, the American victory in the Persian Gulf gave Mr. Bush some of the highest ratings ever scored, yet in November, 1992, he was driven from office by Mr. Clinton.
And besides, as Representative Porter Johnston Goss, a Florida Republican, remarked acidly this afternoon, "You can't really claim a great national victory by saying we overcame that vicious foreign enemy, the Haitian army."

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN HAITI;
In the Words of the President: The Reasons Why the U.S. May Invade Haiti

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's address to the nation last night on Haiti, as recorded by The New York Times:
My fellow Americans: 
 Tonight I want to speak with you about why the United States is leading the international effort to restore democratic Government in Haiti.
Haiti's dictators, led by Gen. Raoul Cedras, control the most violent regime in our hemisphere. For three years they have rejected every peaceful solution that the international community has proposed. They have broken an agreement that they made to give up power. They have brutalized their people and destroyed their economy. And for three years we and other nations have worked exhaustively to find a diplomatic solution, only to have the dictators reject each one.
Now the United States must protect our interests, to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians; to secure our borders and to preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere, and to uphold the reliability of the commitments we make and the commitments others make to us.
Earlier today I ordered Secretary of Defense Perry to call up the military reserve personnel necessary to support United States troops in any action we might undertake in Haiti. I have also ordered two aircraft carriers, the U.S.S. Eisenhower and the U.S.S. America, into the region. I issued these orders after giving full consideration to what is at stake.
The message of the United States to the Haitian dictators is clear: Your time is up. Leave now or we will force you from power.
I want the American people to understand the background of the situation in Haiti -- how what has happened there affects our national security interests, and why I believe we must act now.
Nearly 200 years ago, the Haitian people rose up out of slavery and declared their independence. Unfortunately, the promise of liberty was quickly snuffed out.
And ever since, Haiti has known more suffering and repression than freedom.
In our time, as democracy has spread throughout our hemisphere, Haiti has been left behind.
 
'Nightmare of Bloodshed'
 Then, just four years ago, the Haitian people held the first free and fair elections since their independence. They elected a Parliament and a new President -- Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a Catholic priest who received almost 70 percent of the vote.
But eight months later, Haitian dreams of democracy became a nightmare of bloodshed.
Gen. Raoul Cedras led a military coup that overthrew President Aristide, the man who had appointed Cedras to lead the army. Resisters were beaten and murdered. The dictators launched a horrible intimidation campaign of rape, torture and mutilation. People starved. Children died. Thousands of Haitians fled their country, heading to the United States across dangerous seas.
At that time, President Bush declared the situation posed, and I quote, "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."
Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign of terror, executing children, raping women, killing priests. As the dictators have grown more desperate, the atrocities have grown ever more brutal.
Recent news reports have documented the slaying of Haitian orphans by the nation's deadly police thugs. The dictators are said to suspect the children of harboring sympathy toward President Aristide for no other reason than he ran an orphanage in his days as a parish priest. The children fled the orphanages for the streets. Now they can't even sleep there because they're so afraid.
As one young boy told a visitor, "I do not care if the police kill me because it only brings and end to my suffering."
 
'A Terrifying Pattern'
 International observers uncovered a terrifying pattern of soldiers and policemen raping the wives and daughters of suspected political dissidents -- young girls, 13, 16 years old. People slain and mutilated, with body parts left as warnings to terrify others. Children forced to watch as their mothers' faces are slashed with machetes.
A year ago the dictators assassinated the Minister of Justice. Just last month they gunned down Father Jean-Marie Vincent, a peasant leader and close friend of Father Aristide. Vincent was executed on the doorstep of his home, a monastery. He refused to give up his ministry and for that he was murdered.
Let me be clear: General Cedras and his accomplices alone are responsible for this suffering and terrible human tragedy. It is their actions that have isolated Haiti.
Neither the international community nor the United States has sought a confrontation. For nearly three years we've worked hard on diplomatic efforts. The United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Caribbean community, the six Central American presidents, all have sought a peaceful end to this crisis. We have tried everything -- persuasion and negotiation, mediation and condemnation. Emissaries were dispatched to Port-au-Prince and were turned away.
The United Nations labored for months to reach an agreement acceptable to all parties. Then last year, General Cedras himself came here to the United States and signed an agreement on Governors Island in New York in which he pledged to give up power along with the other dictators. But when the day came for the plan to take effect, the dictators refused to leave and instead increased the brutality they are using to cling to power.
Even then, the nations of the world continued to seek a peaceful solution. While strengthening the embargo we had imposed, we sent massive amounts of humanitarian aid, food for a million Haitians and medicine to try to help the ordinary Haitian people as the dictators continued to loot the economy.
 
Scorn for the U.N.
 And then this summer they threw out the international observers who had blown the whistle on the regime's human rights atrocities. In response to that action, in July the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution that authorizes the use of all necessary means, including force, to remove the Haitian dictators from power and restore democratic government.
Still we continued to seek a peaceful solution. But the dictators would not even meet with the United Nations special envoy.
In the face of this continued defiance, and with atrocities rising, the United States has agreed to lead a multinational force to carry out the will of the United Nations. More than 20 countries from around the globe -- including almost all the Caribbean community and nations from as far away as Poland, which has so recently won its own freedom; Israel and Jordan, which have been struggling for decades to preserve their own security, and Bangladesh, a country working on its own economic problems -- have joined nations like Belgium and Great Britain.
They have all agreed to join us because they think this problem in our neighborhood is important to their future interest and their security.
I know that the United States cannot, indeed we should not be the world's policeman. And I know that this is a time, with the cold war over, that so many Americans are reluctant to commit military resources and our personnel beyond our borders. But when brutality occurs close to your shores, it affects our national interests and we have a responsibility to act. Thousands of Haitians have already fled toward the United States, risking their lives to escape the reign of terror.
 
The Costs to the U.S.
 As long as Cedras rules, Haitians will continue to seek sanctuary in our nation. This year, in less than two months, more than 21,000 Haitians were rescued at sea by our Coast Guard and Navy. Today more than 14,000 refugees are living at our naval base in Guantanamo. The American people have already expended almost $200 million to support them, to maintain the economic embargo, and the prospect of millions and millions more being spent every month for an indefinite period of time loom ahead unless we act.
Three hundred thousand more Haitians -- 5 percent of their entire population -- are in hiding in their own country. If we don't act, they could be the next wave of refugees at our door. We will continue to face the threat of a mass exodus of refugees and its constant threat to stability in our region and control of our borders."
No American should be surprised as the recent tide of migrants seeking refuge along our shores comes from Haiti and from Cuba. After all, they're the only nations left in the Western Hemisphere where democratic government is denied, the only countries where dictators have managed to hold back the wave of democracy and progress that has swept over our entire region and that our own Government has so actively promoted and supported for years.
Today 33 of the 35 countries in the Americas have democratically elected leaders. And Haiti is the only nation in our hemisphere where the people actually elected their own Government and chose democracy, only to have tyrants steal it away.
There's no question that the Haitian people want to embrace democracy. We know it because they went to the ballot box and told the world.
History has taught us that preserving democracy in our own hemisphere strengthens America's security and prosperity. Democracies here are more likely to keep the peace and to stabilize our region, and more likely to create free markets and economic opportunity and to become strong, reliable trading partners, and they're more likely to provide their own people with the opportunities that will encourage them to stay in their nations and to build their own futures.
Restoring Haiti's democratic Government will help lead to more stability and prosperity in our region, just as our actions in Panama and Grenada did.
Beyond the human rights violations, the immigration problems, the importance of democracy, the United States also has strong interests in not letting dictators, especially in our own region, break their word to the United States and the United Nations.
 
'The Right Is Clear'
 In the post-cold-war world, we will assure the security and prosperity of the United States with our military strength, our economic power, our constant efforts to promote peace and growth. But when our national security interests are threatened, we will use diplomacy when possible and force when necessary.
In Haiti we have a case in which the right is clear, in which the country in question is nearby, in which our own interests are plain, in which the mission is achievable and limited and in which the nations of the world stand with us. We must act.
Our mission in Haiti, as it was in Panama and Grenada, will be limited and specific.
Our plan to remove the dictators will follow two phases. First, it will remove dictators from power and restore Haiti's legitimate democratically government. We will train a civilian control Haitian security force that will protect the people rather than repress them. During this period police monitors from all around the world will work with the authorities to maximize basic security and civil order and minimize retribution.
The Haitian people should know that we come in peace. And you, the American people, should know that our soldiers will not be involved in rebuilding Haiti or its economy. The international community working together must provide that economic, humanitarian and technical assistance necessary to help the Haitians rebuild.
When this first phase is completed, the vast majority of our troops will come home in months, not years. I want our troops and their families to know that we'll bring them home just as soon as we possibly can.
Then, in the second phase, a much smaller U.S. force will join forces from other members of the United Nations, and their mission will leave Haiti after elections are held next year and a new Haitian Government takes office in early 1996.
Tonight, I can announced that President Aristide has pledged to step down when his term ends, in accordance with the Constitution he has sworn to uphold. He has committed himself to promote reconciliation among all Haitians and to set an historic example by peacefully transferring power to a duly elected successor. He knows, as we know, that when you start a democracy, the most important election is the second election.
President Aristide has told me that he will consider his mission fulfilled not when he regains office, but when he leaves office to the next democratically elected President of Haiti. He has pledged to honor the Haitian voters who put their faith in the ballot box.
 
'The Risks Are There'
 In closing let me say that I know the American people are rightfully concerned whenever our soldiers are put at risk. Our volunteer military is the world's finest. And its leaders have worked hard to minimize risks to all our forces.
But the risks are there and we must be prepared for that. I assure you that no President makes decisions like this one without deep thought and prayer. But it's my job as President and Commander in Chief to take those actions that I believe will best protect our national security interests.
Let me say again the nations of the world have tried every possible way to restore Haiti's democratic Government peacefully. The dictators have rejected every possible solution. The terror, the desperation and the instability will not end until they leave.
Once again I urge them to do so. They can still move now and reduce the chaos and disorder, increase the security, the stability and the safety in which this transfer back to democracy can occur. But if they do not leave now, the international community will act to honor our commitment, to give democracy a chance, not to guarantee it, to remove stubborn and cruel dictators, not to impose a future.
I know many people believe that we shouldn't help the Haitian people recover their democracy and find their hard-won freedom, that the Haitians should accept the violence and repression as their fate.
But remember, the same was said of a people who more than 200 years ago took up arms against a tyrant whose forces occupied their land. But they were a stubborn bunch, a people who fought for their freedoms and appealed to all those who believed in democracy to help their cause. And their cries were answered. And a new nation was born, a nation that ever since has believed that the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be denied to none.
May God bless the people of the United States and the cause of freedom.
Good night.

HEADLINE: Richard Herrnstein, 64, Dies; Backed Nature Over Nurture

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN 

 BODY:
Richard J. Herrnstein, a Harvard University psychologist whose theory that intelligence was largely inherited made him a focus for debate, died at his home in Belmont, Mass., on Tuesday. He was 64.
The cause was lung cancer, said the Reardon Funeral Home in Belmont. 
 Dr. Herrnstein was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard, where he had taught for 36 years.
His writings drew intense hostility from liberal academics and support from conservative theorists, who saw them as compatible with their opposition to social programs like Head Start, which gives learning help to the disadvantaged.
Dr. Herrnstein first set off debate on I.Q., race and class in 1971 when he published an article in The Atlantic Monthly contending that intelligence is largely inherited, so no matter what efforts were made, egalitaranism would not work.
In a 1971 interview in The New York Times, he predicted that an inborn lack of ability would bar those of low I.Q. from career success, creating a "biological stratification" into castes based on "hereditary meritocracy." Dr. Herrnstein expanded his views into a 1973 book, "I.Q. and Meritocracy," which ignited arguments over the uses of I.Q. testing.
Dr. Herrnstein drew heavily on the data of Dr. Arthur Jensen, a psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley, who held that differences between the races in I.Q. were the result of heredity rather than factors like education or economic status. Because of this, Dr. Herrnstein was widely assumed in the academic debates to share Dr. Jensen's views on race and I.Q., which Dr. Herrnstein denied.
Because of his views, Dr. Herrnstein was often harassed in the early 1970's and his classes at Harvard were disrupted by student protesters. When Dr. Herrnstein took part in a debate on I.Q. and heredity sponsored by the magazine Social Policy at the Carnegie Center in Manhattan in 1973, the two hours of questions from his audience were largely hostile.
In an article in The Atlantic Monthly in 1982, Dr. Herrnstein asserted not only that I.Q. was inherited, but that because this was so, compensatory education was futile.
A 1985 book, "Crime and Human Nature," which Dr. Herrnstein wrote with James Q. Wilson, a political scientist now at the University of Southern California, held that a propensity toward crime had biological roots, which were inherited. That book also ignited debate over the question of "nature versus nurture."
This month, Dr. Herrnstein's latest book, "The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life" (The Free Press), is to be published. The "bell curve" refers to the bell-like image created by graphs of the distribution of I.Q. in the general population. The book carries forward Dr. Herrnstein's position that inherited abilities dictate intelligence and so determine success in life.
In the book, Dr. Herrnstein and his co-author, Charles Murray, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, contend that I.Q. is linked to economic success, criminality and being dependent on welfare. They argue that since I.Q. is fixed by genetics, it cannot be changed meaningfully by environment or learning.
While most behavior geneticists agree that a large component of intelligence is inherited, they would say that the contribution of environment is also significant. And they disagree with the social implications Dr. Herrnstein drew.
But Dr. Herrnstein was regarded with respect because "he understood and honored data," said Dr. Jerome Kagan, a psychologist at Harvard. Dr. Herrnstein was chairman of the Harvard psychology department from 1967 to 1971 and editor of The Psychological Bulletin from 1975 to 1981.
Dr. Herrnstein's position at the center of debate over I.Q. would not have been predicted from his early career. His groundbreaking work in the 1950's and 1960's was in the field of behaviorist psychological theory, not intelligence.
In research on laboratory animals, Dr. Herrnstein mapped with mathematical precision the link between behavior and rewards and formulated what is known as "matching law," which shows that animals learn to repeat an action in direct proportion to the degree the action is reinforced by a reward like food.
A main disciple of B. F. Skinner, the principle learning theorist, Dr. Herrnstein joined his mentor on the Harvard faculty in 1958 after serving in the Army for three years. A graduate of City College of New York, Dr. Herrnstein had been a star pupil of Dr. Skinner's while earning his doctorate at Harvard, which he was awarded in 1955.
The child of Hungarian immigrant parents, Dr. Herrnstein was born in 1930 in New York City, where he attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan.
Dr. Herrnstein is survived by his wife, Susan; a daughter, Julia Manganaro of Fontana, Calif.; two sons, Max, of Tokyo, and James, of Cambridge, Mass., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: STATES AGAIN TRY HEALTH CHANGES AS CONGRESS FAILS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Efforts by the states to provide health care and health insurance for their residents have taken on new importance now that the most ambitious Federal plans to remake the nation's health care system have fizzled.
The states have been a source of innovation in health policy for nearly a decade. While their interest in the issue never waned, some held back this year, waiting for Congress to define a standard package of health benefits that would be guaranteed to all Americans under Federal law. 
 "The failure of Federal health care reform will place new pressures on states because the problems are not going away," Ronald M. Hollander, executive vice president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association, said last week. "We still have the problems of the uninsured and rising health costs."
Indeed, many state officials suspected all along that they could not count on Washington to solve their problems, and moved ahead on their own with innovations that are just now paying dividends.
California, Florida and Texas, for instance, have enrolled thousands of people in health insurance alliances that pool the purchasing power of small businesses, enabling them to get coverage at prices far lower than what they would otherwise pay. President Clinton and Congress are still bickering over the details and merits of such alliances, but more than 20 states have begun experimenting with them.
In addition, almost every state has passed a law tightening the regulation of health insurance, requiring insurers to sell coverage to small businesses and limiting the variation in rates.
The Clinton Administration said today that it would allow Florida to conduct a Medicaid experiment aimed at providing coverage for 1.1 million Floridians with no health insurance. Gov. Lawton Chiles said he expected to save $3.2 billion in Federal Medicaid money over five years by enrolling all Medicaid recipients in some form of managed care. The money would be used to subsidize private coverage for people who are now uninsured and ineligible for Medicaid.
Hawaii, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and a handful of other states have expanded their Medicaid programs -- with Federal permission -- to provide subsidized health insurance to people who would ordinarily be ineligible for Medicaid. Typically, these states require patients to enroll in some form of managed care, which limits their freedom to choose doctors and hospitals.
The Tennessee program, which went into effect last Jan. 1, covers 803,800 people who were formerly on Medicaid and 335,300 who had no health insurance. Gov. Ned McWherter, a Democrat, said that 94 percent of the state's residents were now insured. He predicted, "Tennessee will cover at least 95 percent of its citizens with health insurance by the end of 1994, seven years faster than the most aggressive goal set for the nation under legislation being debated in Congress."
In Oregon, 91,000 poor people have been added to the Medicaid program since February. That is 65 percent more than the state had expected.
"We had assumed that most of the people coming in would be singles and childless couples," said Jean I. Thorne, the Medicaid director in Oregon. "But two-thirds of the people have a child in the family, and a majority of the families are two-parent families."
At the same time, states are learning the limits of what they can do. The biggest limit, by far, is a 1974 Federal law that prevents states from regulating, taxing or interfering with the health plans set up by companies that serve as their own insurers, using their own assets to pay claims.
Big multistate companies pioneered the use of such self-insurance arrangements, but many companies with fewer than 100 employees have followed suit. As a result, states are unable to supervise or regulate the health benefits of huge numbers of people who live and work within their borders.
Companies like to serve as their own insurers because they can avoid state insurance regulations and premium taxes, can tailor benefits to meet their employees' needs and can get discounts through direct negotiations with doctors, hospitals and others who provide health care.
Under the 1974 law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa, states cannot require self-insured companies to provide any specific health benefits, to contribute any particular amount of money or even to report basic data on their spending for employee health benefits.
Last year, for example, Washington State passed a law requiring companies to offer health insurance and pay at least half of the premiums for full-time workers and their families. In Oregon, an employer mandate is supposed to take effect in 1997 and 1998. Neither requirement can be enforced unless Congress grants exemptions from Erisa.
Gov. Mike Lowry of Washington, a Democrat, said, "If Congress would just remove the obstacles caused by Erisa, we could reform the health care system."
In November, Californians will vote on a ballot measure to establish a publicly financed program of health insurance for legal residents of the state. The American Association of Retired Persons, labor unions and consumer groups support the proposal for a "single payer" health care system like the one in Canada. Insurance companies, some hospitals, many businesses and some taxpayer groups oppose it.
The state might need an exemption from Erisa to operate the program. Supporters of the proposal said they would have a strong case in seeking such an exemption from Congress if California voters approved the ballot measure.
John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for the A.A.R.P., said: "We still need health care reform. If we can't get it at the Federal level, we want it at the state level."
Even as some states plowed ahead with health care legislation, others were waiting for the Federal Government to act.
Carol H. Malone, who monitors state activity for the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, said: "The pace of health care reform at the state level slowed in the first six months of 1994. The possibility of Federal health care reform put the brakes on reform at the state level.
"Rather than adopting comprehensive legislation as they did in 1992 and 1993, states for the most part opted to restructure their health care delivery and financing systems in incremental stages, through regulation of the health insurance industry, particularly the small-group market, and through introduction of purchasing cooperatives."
A survey by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association concluded, " 'Caution' is the byword in 1994, as states have overwhelmingly chosen incremental over broad-based reforms."
Last year Florida created 11 regional purchasing alliances for small businesses and self-employed people. Each alliance offers 100 to 150 health plans. But when Governor Chiles, a Democrat, tried to go further this year by proposing to provide subsidized coverage for uninsured people with incomes up to two and a half times the Federal poverty level, the proposal died in the Florida Legislature amid partisan conflict. Last year the Federal poverty level for a family of four was $14,764, and for an individual, $7,357.
Republicans denounced the proposal as welfare. Mr. Chiles, who is running for re-election, said Republicans had blocked the plan for political reasons. He will try again to win approval from the Legislature now that he has permission from the Federal Government.
In Vermont, efforts to guarantee health insurance for its residents collapsed earlier this year, foreshadowing what would happen in Congress.
"We tried to do too much too quickly," said Sean P. Campbell, a Democrat who is majority leader of the State House of Representatives. "It was too big. We couldn't swallow it. We ended up spitting it out."
Massachusetts, like Vermont, was ahead of most states in trying to revamp its health care. In 1988, under Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, it passed a law requiring employers to insure their workers or pay a tax to finance a state insurance program.
The requirement became unpalatable when the state's economy foundered. It has repeatedly been delayed and is now scheduled to take effect in January, but will probably be changed or delayed again. Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican, opposes the requirement. He has proposed tax credits and subsidies to induce employers to provide health insurance.
In some states, officials can barely keep up with changes in the private health care market, where insurance companies, hospitals, clinics and drug companies are merging and devising all sorts of novel arrangements to control costs and promote the use of managed care.
In Minnesota, provisions of laws passed in 1992 and 1993 were delayed as people became concerned about the rapid merger of health plans into huge networks. Curtis W. Johnson, chief of staff to Gov. Arne Carlson, a Republican, said the earlier laws "had the effect of overheating the market and caused near-panic among physicians," who feared they would be driven out of business if they did not join one of the networks.

HEADLINE: Dow Level Is Highest In 7 Months

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Heartened by another round of encouraging data on inflation, stock traders bid up prices in a powerful rally yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 58.55 points, to 3,953.88, its highest level since Feb. 3, the day before the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates for the first time this year.
Yesterday's trading brings the best-known measure of stock market performance within hailing distance of the psychologically important level of 4,000, where many investors and stock pundits are sure to proclaim the coming of a new bull market. And it is just some 24 points away from the Dow's all-time high of 3,978.36 reached Jan. 31. 
 But some stock traders warned yesterday that the rally might be evanescent and due mainly to technical factors, like the expiration of certain stock options today in the so-called triple-witching hour, when three kinds of stock options expire and prices can gyrate wildly.
The Dow, these traders warned, has a potential for a sharp drop, especially since much of the last-minute rise yesterday was a result of a huge computer program that bought and sold millions of shares in hundreds of stocks just minutes before the market closed and accounted for more than a third of the advance.
For the moment, the stock market has recovered all the ground it lost last Friday and then some. A Government report then on producer prices spooked traders by giving an unambiguous signal of rising inflation. But more recent data, including a moderate Consumer Price Index on Tuesday, indicate that businesses may be having trouble raising prices at the level of supermarkets and department stores.
Yesterday, three sets of data -- a low inflation report by a regional Federal Reserve Bank, a drop in jobless claims and a rise in business inventories -- all contributed to the Dow's rise. The data reinforced a predisposition among stock traders that the Fed would not raise interest rates at its meeting later this month and, perhaps, not until after the November elections.
The first Fed rate increase this year, on Feb. 4, send the Dow plunging some 96 points, to 3,871.42 from 3,967.66. Higher interest rates raise corporate borrowing costs, hurt the price of bonds and cut profits, thus reducing the value of most stocks.
"Inflation fears were unfounded last Friday," said David Holt, chief market strategist at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "And it has taken the last few days for the market to realize it."
But not all of the major stock indexes rose. The Dow Jones transportation average fell 1.84 points, to 1,576.45. "It means something's not right," said Todd Clark, senior director of equity trading at Mabon Securities Inc. "You want all the soldiers marching to the same beat. Once the options expiration plays out, you could see a lot of downside action."
Technical factors that may have lifted stock prices included high-speed computer-guided trading that is triggered when price differences between different markets occur; trading strategies that lead to buying and selling stocks ahead of today's triple witching, and even the observance of Yom Kippur, which thinned the ranks of traders yesterday and may have led to reduced trading volume and thus greater price volatility.
The Dow, which had been rising steadily all day, spurted in the last 10 minutes of trading, in part, because of computer-guided trading. Birinyi Associates, which tracks such trading, estimates that a "massive program" of 30.2 million shares and involving 332 stocks in the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 raised stock indexes sharply.
Gregory Schoenleber, an analyst at Birinyi, estimated that the program added 22 points to the Dow and 2.1 points to the S.& P. 500. The probable identity of the major Wall Street brokerage firm that ran the computer program will not be clear until the New York Stock Exchange compiles computer-trading figures later this month.
The broader S.& P. index rose 6.01 points, to 474.81. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 10.05 points, to 778.66. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.94 points, to 261.42, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,529 to 625. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.41 points, to 459.74.
Trading volume was 281.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, below this year's average of 286 million shares.
The inflation data the market relies on are often open to question. Yesterday's low-inflation report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, for example, is regional, limited in methodology, and often affected by weather, which can prevent trucks and planes from delivering goods on time.
Traders sometimes follow the Philadelphia figures because, unlike the Consumer Price Index, which is a documented census of historical prices, the Philadelphia numbers are a quick snapshot of prices in motion.
In the prices-paid index of its Business Outlook Survey, the Philadelphia Fed asks a sample of manufacturers in some parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware whether they paid more, less or the same price for materials at the time of the survey. The index fell to 40.4 this month from 48.4 in August.
But the index does not say whether the materials were economically significant or whether after the price increase, price levels were still relatively low and thus noninflationary.
More often than not, bond traders pay attention to the index only when it reinforces the bond market's conventional wisdom. The stock market often, but not always, follows the cue of the bond market.
On Feb. 17, for example, two weeks after the Federal Reserve raised rates, bond traders believed an inflation-is-rising index from the Philadelphia Fed. But on March 17, when the Philadelphia Fed released an inflation-is-falling index, bond traders did not believe it and bid prices down.
On April 21, when the Philadelphia Fed reported an inflation-is-rising index, the bond market also did not believe it, and bid prices up.

HEADLINE: Hotel Workers Threatening To Strike in Atlantic City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Sept. 15

 BODY:
With a quarter of this city's hotel workers threatening to go on strike Friday night, the big worry on the minds of many hotel guests here today is not about having enough maids to make beds or waiters to serve meals. What really concerns many visitors now, say hotel staff, is that a strike would force the cancellation of the annual boardwalk parade of 50 hopefuls of the Miss America pageant, a highlight of the event being held this weekend.
"Guests are more interested in the parade than having their beds made," said Marvella Spencer, a guest-services representative in the lobby of the Trump Plaza Hotel. She estimated that 150 guests had inquired about the fate of the parade today alone. 
 If there is a strike, pageant officials said they would call the parade off because they feared a confrontation with pickets on the boardwalk.
If talks break down and the 11,500 members of Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International go on strike, hotel managers said they planned to fill in, as best they could, for the maids, waitresses, cooks, bartenders, bellmen and other service workers.
"A strike would have an impact on customer service," said Michael A. DiLeva, a spokesman for the Casino Association, a trade group for the city's casino hotels, which are nearly all fully booked for this weekend. "But we are committed to remaining open and maintaining a high level of service so that, afterward, Local 54 members would have jobs to return to."
Neither union nor management officials would discuss the labor dispute today.
The union workers represent about a quarter of the 42,000 employees who keep Atlantic City's 8,960 hotel rooms tidy and work in the 12 hotels' 92 restaurants and 30 bars. Local 54 does not represent any casino workers.
How much impact a strike would have is hard to gauge. John M. Molloy, 45, who pushes tourists in one of the wicker "rolling chairs" that are Atlantic City's version of the Venetian gondola, predicted that a strike would disrupt the entire city's economy. "The whole city will suffer if people stop coming," he said.
But Jeff Mason, 36, who performs as a one-man band on the boardwalk, said the strike would not have much lasting impact. "After this weekend, we're entering the slow season, when hotels usually lay off a lot of workers anyway," he said as he began his version of "Johnny B. Goode."
Wage increases appear to be the biggest concern of the union workers. On Tuesday, workers rejected, by a 3-to-2 ratio, a proposed contract. The proposed contract would have increased wages by an average of 17.8 percent over the five years it covered. Union leaders had initially asked for a 32.5 percent increase.
But some workers also told reporters on Tuesday that they were voting against the proposed contract simply because their leaders had failed to explain its terms on a particularly chaotic day. Some other workers said that, after standing in line for hours to vote, they had cast their ballots in anger. Union officials said that they had not expected so many members, more than 6,000, to turn out for the vote and that, as a result, preparations were inadequate.
A half-dozen union workers interviewed in hotels today said that they were optimistic a strike would be avoided. Several waitresses and bartenders said they planned to vote for the next proposal, no matter what provisions were made for wage increases.
"You're looking at people who make $5.64 an hour," said a waitress in Harvey's Deli at the Trump Plaza Hotel who would give only her first name, Charlotte. "We work on tips, so the pay increases don't matter anything to us."
Negotiations are scheduled to resume at 9 A.M. on Friday. Workers who called the union hall today heard a taped message, "If our demands are not met, we will stand by our strike deadline of 6 P.M. Friday."
Leonard C. Horn, president of The Miss America Organization, a nonprofit corporation based here, said that a strike would not have any significant effect on the competition.
The 10 finalists who will vie for the Miss America 1995 crown are to compete in the Atlantic City Convention Center on Saturday night, starting at 9 P.M.
Competitors have not talked much about the possible hotel workers' strike, said Arian G. Archer, Miss Texas. "I would be willing to make my own bed," she said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Show Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday as the market regained confidence that inflation was slowing after a regional economic report showed growth was moderating.
Prices made their big jump at midmorning after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its monthly survey of regional business conditions showed drops in two price indexes. The bond market greeted the report with some relief. After last month's Philadelphia Fed report, which showed a surge in prices paid by manufacturers, bonds tumbled. 
 The September survey of factories found moderately stronger manufacturing activity over all.
"A lot of people thought there should be declines in the overall measure, too," said Joe Lavorgna, money market analyst at UBS Securities Inc. "The fact that we still went up on the prices news shows they're really paying attention to inflation data."
Some cautioned the Philadelphia Fed survey represents just a small region of the country, including Delaware, most of Pennsylvania and part of New Jersey.
"You're kind of grasping at straws when you look at those results, but the market is giving them some attention," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.
A third consecutive decline in commodity prices also helped the bond market. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities was down 1.76 points, at 228.63, led by declines in corn and other grains as abundant harvests are coming in under fair weather in the Midwest. The declines in commodity prices helped ease worries of inflation, which can weaken the value of fixed-length investments like bonds.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 7/16 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.63 percent, from 7.67 percent on Wednesday.
Bond prices fell sharply last Friday after the Government reported a surprising jump in producer prices for August of six-tenths of 1 percent. Since then, traders have perceived the market was oversold and it has been recovering incrementally since.
"I think we're probably at a more fair value now," Mr. Lavorgna of UBS Securities said.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 4.68 percent as the discount held at 4.57 percent. Six-month yields held at 5.13 percent as the discount was unchanged at 4.94 percent. One-year yields dropped to 5.59 percent as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point, to 5.30 percent.
The Treasury sold $16.763 billion of one-year bills yesterday at an average rate of 5.38 percent. The rate was 2 basis points above last month's average of 5.36 percent and the highest since 5.88 percent at the July 1991 auction of one-year bills, the Treasury said. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 94.560
Discounted Rate . . . 5.38%
Coupon Yield . . . 5.69%

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up vs. Mark and Yen In a Day of Light Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the mark yesterday as traders bet that Germany would cut interest rates after next month's elections.
Trading was quiet, with many foreign exchange desks thinly staffed in New York on Yom Kippur and Tokyo markets closed for a national holiday. 
 Although the Bundesbank kept interest rates unchanged yesterday, traders are increasingly confident that the central bank will cut interest rates at least one more time this year after the Oct. 16 federal elections.
The absence of a move on rates, after a meeting of the central bank's policy-making commitee, had been anticipated because the Bundesbank does not want to be seen influencing the elections by altering monetary policy ahead of the polls, traders said.
Lower German interest rates would make deposits denominated in marks less attractive to foreign investors.
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5460 marks from 1.5415 marks on Wednesday.
The dollar also advanced against the Japanese yen, helped by signs of progress in trade talks between the United States and Japan. Ronald H. Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, said on Wednesday that he hoped a trade deal "on every area" would be sealed by the Sept. 30 deadline set by the United States. Washington has threatened to impose sanctions on Tokyo if a deal is not met by then.
 Callum Henderson, an analyst with MMS International, said: "It would be equally disastrous for the United States and for Japan not to have an agreement. It's not in anyone's interest to end up with a complete impasse. But whether an agreement will be meaningful or not remains to be seen."
The dollar was quoted at 99.50 yen, up from 99.21 yen on Wednesday. The dollar also recovered a bit against the Swiss franc after falling briefly to a two-year low on Wednesday. Many currency dealers consider the Swiss franc and the mark to be the so-called safe-haven currencies. The dollar rose to 1.2848 Swiss francs, from 1.2810 on Wednesday.
 In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 5.2870 French francs, up from 5.2750 francs on Wednesday, and at 1,564 Italian lire, down from 1,567 lire. The British pound slipped to $1.5628, from $1.5650 on Wednesday.

Raytheon Merging 2 Aircraft Units

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Mass., Sept. 15

 BODY:
The Raytheon Company said today that it would combine two divisions to form the Raytheon Aircraft Company in a consolidation that will cost 940 workers their jobs.
The company is merging the Beech Aircraft Corporation and Raytheon Corporate Jets, which makes the Hawker line of business aircraft. The new company, to be called the Raytheon Aircraft Company, will have annual sales of $1.7 billion. 
 Raytheon, based here, has been searching for ways to increase its civilian business and reduce costs as the nation's military business has declined. While the corporate jet market has been increasingly difficult, as companies slash expenses, Raytheon says its aircraft business has grown steadily.
"The fact is it's been a tough market -- a tough market for everybody," said a Raytheon spokeswoman, Elizabeth Allen. "But we think that by combining these two companies we will have a very powerful aircraft company."
Shares of Raytheon rose 87.5 cents today, to $66.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Raytheon acquired Beech Aircraft, the world's No. 1 producer of aircraft for the general aviation market, in 1980. It bought Raytheon Corporate Jets from British Aerospace in August 1993 for $273 million in a move that analysts considered a smart purchase.
"They got it at a tremendous price," said Peter Aseritis, analyst with CS First Boston in New York. "It's been a very good success for them."
Raytheon's two aircraft divisions had $1.46 billion in sales in the 1993 fiscal year, Ms. Allen said. Beech's revenue climbed to $1.25 billion in 1992 from $1.1 billion in 1991, she said.
While the use of business jets declined during the recession, the market is growing, Mr. Aseritis said. "I would be surprised if the overall corporate jet market didn't expand, at least at a moderate rate, in the next few years," he said.
The new company, to be based in Wichita, Kan., will make midsize and light jets, jetprops, and piston-powered aircraft. The company will keep the names Beech and Hawker.
As a result of the merger, Raytheon will lay off people at all five of the new company's production plants. Three of the plants are in the United States and two are in Britain.
Earlier this year, Raytheon announced the consolidation of procurement and international sales and service for the two divisions.
Arthur Wegner, formerly chairman and chief executive of Beech Aircraft, will be chairman and chief executive of Raytheon Aircraft. Roy Norris 3d, formerly president and chief executive of Raytheon Corporate Jets, will be its president.

HEADLINE: Inventories Increase Moderately

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Business inventories increased moderately in July, the Government said today, easing concerns that excessive stockpiles could be a significant drag on the economy this year.
The Commerce Department reported that business inventories of unsold goods rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July, the fourth consecutive increase but the smallest since inventories fell in March. The size of the backlog was less than half the rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent expected by analysts. 
 "We have just not been hearing much from any quarter of the economy that there is an undesirable buildup," said David Munro of High Frequency Economics, a New York City forecaster. The new report "takes inventory overhang off the table as a brake on second-half economic growth."
Financial markets reacted positively to the report and other data, particularly a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Fed's current monthly survey of factories in Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey showed that manufacturing grew moderately and that prices paid for material goods declined sharply from August.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said today that the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 3,000 last week to the lowest level in three weeks. The department said 327,000 people filed jobless claims in the week ending Sept. 10. It marked the second consecutive weekly decline.
Business inventories, meanwhile totaled a seasonally adjusted $891.5 billion, up from $889.1 billion in June. The increase follows a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in June after a big 1.2 percent buildup in May.
The May advance, the biggest since inventories climbed 1.3 percent in October 1987, prompted some analysts to predict slower economic growth in the second half of this year if sales failed to keep pace.
But the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that retail sales rose a strong eight-tenths of 1 percent in August, with gains in nearly every major category.
"Retail sales are good enough to pull goods off the shelf," said Robert Eggert of Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc. in Sedona, Ariz.
Stockpiles have now risen in six of the last seven months, slipping in March by two-tenths of 1 percent for their only decline this year.
Business sales declined eight-tenths of 1 percent in July -- the largest drop since a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent in August 1992 -- after gaining nine-tenths of 1 percent in June and four-tenths of 1 percent in May. Sales in July slipped to a seasonally adjusted $627.7 billion from $632.9 billion.
The inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.42, compared with 1.40 in June. That means it would take 1.42 months to exhaust stockpiles at the July sales rate. The ratio was at a low of 1.39 in March.

Now at Risk Is Owners' Security Blanket: Antitrust Exemption

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Wanna see the baseball club owners really squirm? Repeal their exemption from the antitrust laws.
Major League Baseball's privileged place in the legal sun, granted by the United States Supreme Court in 1922, has long been questioned by antitrust hawks. And repeal is sure to be on the agenda of frustrated fans and their representatives next week when the House Judiciary subcommittee holds a hearing on the collapse of the 1994 season. 
 What has apparently not yet struck a political chord, though, notes Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, is how neatly this punishment would fit the crime. Indeed, says Stelzer, Adam Smith himself couldn't have dreamed up a better one: "It would fix the process without dictating the result."
Both the players and the clubs, argues George Daly, dean of New York University's Stern School of Business, think the origins of the conflict lie in free agency, the right of veteran players to sign with the highest bidder. In fact, says Daly, the explosion in players' salaries can be explained equally well by the surge in national television revenues that are shared among the clubs. Comparable television bonanzas, he notes, yielded comparable surges in incomes for football and basketball stars even when they lacked the freedom to play where they pleased.
As long as revenues were growing rapidly, this distinction could be dismissed as diversion for M.B.A.s who would rather talk sports than crunch numbers. But now that baseball's national television revenues have dropped, there is far less cash to spread around. More to the point, Daly argues, greater dependence on income from stadium and local television revenues has increased the disparity in potential earnings between large-market teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers and small-market teams like the Pittsburgh Pirates.
It is still far from clear that well-managed, well-promoted teams in small markets are doomed to be unprofitable because they are forced to pay competitive salaries. Baltimore, for example, with its spiffy retro stadium and gung-ho fans, looks like a winner.
Nor, for that matter, is it clear that successful teams can't be built on shoestring budgets. Roger Noll, an economist at Stanford who consults for the players, points out that a handful of small-market teams -- notably Montreal and Cleveland -- were doing very well this year with payrolls one-third below the average.
What is clear, though, is that more aggressive revenue-sharing that took the financial pressure off struggling small-market teams would cost the successful major-market teams a lot of money. That apparently explains why major-market club owners brushed aside the possibility in the now-defunct negotiations. And it also explains why attempts to limit team payrolls -- more specifically, salary caps low enough to insure that small-market clubs could bid for their share of the superstars -- became the mantra that united the club owners.
"Salary caps," argues Louis Guth, a senior vice president at National Economic Research Associates and sometime-consultant to the owners, "would be no threat to the American way of life." Indeed, Guth thinks the players were foolish to make a stand on what he believes is a false principle. They might have done very well, he says, by pragmatically accepting the concept and bargaining for a bigger percentage of revenues.
But players have given no sign they are about to touch a single feather on the free-agency goose they (perhaps mistakenly) believe has been laying all those golden eggs. By the same token, the owners seem immovable, setting the stage for what Daly labels "a holy war of attrition." And that's where the antitrust exemption fits in.
Were baseball just another business subject to free-market forces, notes Guth, the enormous disparities in the earning power of teams -- and, by implication, the club owners' rationale for insisting on salary caps -- couldn't survive long. Unprofitable franchises would move, often to large cities already occupied by very profitable ones. But as long as baseball is exempt from the antitrust laws, he says, large-market teams can and will veto moves that undermine their profitability.
Guth doesn't necessarily favor the removal of this legally sanctioned impediment to club mobility. Baseball just wouldn't be baseball, he suggests, if, say, the Cardinals could head for Chicago at the whim of some brewmeister. But he concedes that it would force the owners to confront the contradiction between their self-proclaimed roles as managers of profit-maximizing enterprises and legally privileged custodians of the national pastime.
Stelzer is more sanguine. If the Dodgers or the Yankees had to worry about local competition, he argues, they would do what was necessary to reduce other teams' financial incentives to poach on their franchises.
In such a world, aggressive revenue-sharing -- say a sharp increase in the percentage of ticket revenues that went to visiting teams -- would thus serve all team owners rather than just the small-market clubs. And while the salary cap might still be an attractive way for the owners to share the risk of baseball's declining economic fortunes with the players, Stelzer points out that the lure would be much diminished.
In Stelzer's view, then, repeal of the antitrust exemption is a no-brainer: "It wouldn't do any harm," he says, "and it might do a lot of good."

HEADLINE: To the Shores of Port-au-Prince

 BODY:
President Clinton is readying American troops for an invasion of Haiti aimed, he said last night, at ending human rights abuses, securing U.S. borders and upholding Washington's credibility. The address from the Oval Office was meant to convince Americans that the nation has a legitimate national security interest in Haiti worth the risking of American lives. Indeed, Haiti does raise troubling concerns. But concerns and security interests are not the same thing, no matter how hard a President argues.
The fact remains that a Haiti invasion is a mission the country does not believe in, Congress has not approved and Mr. Clinton himself tried to avoid. Even now he is considering the dispatch of a special envoy to deliver one last warning. Perhaps Haiti's dictators will leave and allow the President to end his invasion plans without embarrassment. If not, it falls to Congress to somehow deter him from moving ahead despite so much dissent and sound counsel. 
 The military victory, if it can be called that, would come quickly and perhaps not too messily in the first days. But as time drags on, this diplomacy by intrusion would feed domestic divisiveness, set an unhealthy foreign policy precedent and possibly compromise the cause the Administration means to advance -- Haiti's democratic development.
Instead of trying to guide the President back toward a more prudent and constitutionally scrupulous course, Congressional Democrats, including those quick to invoke constitutional limits on executive power in the past, are behaving shamelessly. Senator George Mitchell's blocking of a floor vote by a likely bipartisan majority against Mr. Clinton's Haiti policy may look like a cute parliamentary trick. It is also an undermining of Congress's solemn duty to decide on issues of war and peace.
Mr. Clinton apparently calculates that he can rally public and Congressional support after an invasion. Perhaps he can. But that support would be perilously thin for a commitment that is likely, given the gory history of Haiti, to go on for years with a constant risk of clashes.
Even if the initial, mainly American invasion force ousts the military leadership, restores President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and re-establishes order as quickly as Mr. Clinton expects, it would then be replaced by a longer-term international force with a substantial U.S. component. The weakness of Haiti's economy, the gap between its peasants and its oligarchical ruling class, and the deeply imbedded corruption of its army all argue that visiting reformers cannot breeze out easily.
Mr. Clinton rightly characterized the Haitian regime as the "most violent regime in our hemisphere." But the Administration has long tolerated even grimmer human rights violations in Bosnia. If the difference is that Haiti is "in our backyard," so is Cuba. Arguments of this nature mark a disturbing return to the old U.S. pattern of treating Western Hemisphere neighbors as something less than sovereign states.
The U.S. does have an interest in defending democracy and human rights in this hemisphere and beyond. But that confers no right or duty to invade countries whose governments have been overthrown and replaced by ones Washington does not like. Last time it was Grenada. This time it is Haiti. What about next time? Would those now urging action against the Haitian junta support the same principle if it were applied somewhere else?
No U.S. interests are at stake in Haiti that would justify risking lives, and no urgency exists that could justify short-circuiting Congressional approval and ignoring public opinion. The right policy remains sanctions plus diplomacy and patience. If the President really wanted to demonstrate cool, tough leadership, he would call this invasion back while he still can.

HEADLINE: The Mystery of Flight 427

 BODY:
The remarkable safety record of America's airlines is marred once again by the horror of U.S. Air Flight 427's plunge into the woods near Pittsburgh last week, killing all 132 passengers and crew. It was the most devastating toll for any U.S. carrier in seven years, and its cause is still a mystery. The chief of the Federal investigators on the scene offers the most sensible comment so far: Don't jump to conclusions about what went wrong.
It was U.S. Air's fifth fatal crash in as many years -- none similar to the others -- and its second in just three months. Given the airline's string of financial losses, there has been speculation it might have cut back on aircraft maintenance. That can happen when an airline is strapped for cash. But a reputation for safety is key to financial recovery, and U.S. Air insists there have been no cutbacks. Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration stepped up its surveillance of U.S. Air operations after the earlier crashes, and has pronounced those operations satisfactory. 
 While U.S. Air's losses have been heavy -- close to $2 billion since 1988 -- the recession has hurt the whole industry. Still, air safety has continued to improve. The National Transportation Safety Board counted 31 fatalities among major U.S. airlines' passengers in 1992, or .0006 deaths for every million miles in the air.
One scholarly study of the causes of air crashes found no clear correlation in modern aviation between crashes and the financial health of the airline involved. Commonly, there is no single cause of a crash but a combination of factors. Whatever caused the U.S. Air jet, a Boeing 737-300, to lurch into a nosedive on its approach to Pittsburgh International Airport is the proper concern of the safety board's investigators.
Armchair analysts are aware of the "black boxes" that record flight data, but perhaps not aware that the boxes themselves have been improved. Those aboard U.S. Air 427 may tell more than the ones in the unexplained crash of another Boeing 737 near Colorado Springs in 1991. In all the thousands of accidents the board has investigated, the Colorado crash is one of only four crashes whose cause has never been determined.
The mystery of U.S. Air 427 may not be solved for months. If its cause can be fixed, it will be. But whatever the cause, there is no new reason to fear flying. The risks do not seem to have changed. There is still more danger on the road to the airport than in the airlanes above.

Crime And Politics

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In apartheid South Africa, at times when political prisoners were subjected to harsh treatment, they were still allowed to earn university degrees by correspondence.
For the United States Congress in 1994, that idea is too enlightened. One section of the omnibus crime bill just signed by President Clinton forbids the awarding of Pell grants for higher education to anyone in prison. That will just about end the possibility of prisoners, who are mostly poor, earning college credits. 
 Is that provision of the bill a blow against crime? To the contrary. Studies show that prisoners who do college work are less than half as likely as other inmates to commit new crimes after their release.
No, Congress inserted the provision to show the public how "tough" it could be -- how mean, how nasty. The realities of fighting crime had nothing to do with it -- or with many other parts of the crime bill.
Consider what the bill does about mandatory minimum sentences, which prison officials and judges and other experts regard as a distorting and self-defeating trend in our law.
Congress in recent years has fixed minimum sentences for many drug offenses. Judges have lost their right -- their duty -- to consider the particular facts of the crime and the offender. They are required to put many non-violent, first-time drug offenders away for 5 or 10 years.
More than 100,000 new drug offenders are being committed to state and Federal prisons every year. The inevitable result is overcrowding of those prisons. Some states solve the problem by releasing other prisoners -- including those the public rightly fears most, men who committed violent crimes.
The new bill moves to lengthen state prison terms as well. It does so by offering states large sums to build new prisons -- but only if they promise to make serious offenders serve at least 85 percent of their sentenced times. Most states now release prisoners after they serve a far smaller portion of their sentences. To get the Federal money the states will have to make their prisons even more overcrowded.
As the crime bill first came out of a Senate-House conference, it had a provision exempting non-violent drug offenders who cooperated with the prosecution for mandatory sentences -- and applying that exemption to similar offenders already in prison.
A freshman Republican Congressman from Long Island, Rick A. Lazio, demanded elimination of the retroactive clause. To get his vote for letting the bill come to the floor, the Democrats gave way to him. As a result, someone who sold a small amount of crack last year may be in a penitentiary for 10 years while someone newly convicted serves 2 years.
These are small examples of benighted provisions that make this crime bill not just a flawed but a wrong-headed piece of legislation. Others can be briefly indicated.
Representative Susan Molinari, Republican of New York, got into the bill a section allowing Federal prosecutors to disclose at the trial of sex crimes the fact that the defendant was previously charged (not convicted) with a sexual offense, civil or criminal, no matter how long ago. So someone falsely accused -- and that does happen -- would be branded.
Another provision narrows the circumstances in which Federal courts can find that conditions in a prison are cruel and unusual, in violation of the Constitution. Another waters down the present rule against executing people who are so mentally ill that they cannot understand the proceedings against them.
The better-known provisions of the crime bill, such as "three strikes, you're out," have their own flaws. How did such a misbegotten piece of legislation become law?
The answer is simple: politics. Democrats wanted to take the crime issue away from Republicans. Republicans responded by sounding "tougher." The Justice Department did not work effectively against the worst features because President Clinton wanted something -- anything -- labeled "crime bill."
Since 1970 the number of inmates in American prisons has quadrupled. We have now passed South Africa for the title of most prisoners per capita in the world. None of this has had a measurable effect on our shockingly high level of crime. But our Government has decided, as The Economist magazine put it, "to take this failed approach to crime policy and extend it."

HEADLINE: EXXON IS ORDERED TO PAY $5 BILLION FOR ALASKA SPILL

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
A Federal jury in Anchorage yesterday ordered the Exxon Corporation to pay $5 billion in punitive damages to about 34,000 fishermen and other Alaskans who said they were harmed by the Exxon Valdez oil spill more than five years ago.
The 11-member jury also ordered the former captain of the Exxon Valdez, Joseph J. Hazelwood, to pay $5,000 in punitive damages. Lawyers for Exxon and Mr. Hazelwood said that the punitive damages, which are meant to punish defendants for harmful behavior, were unfair and that they planned appeals. 
 The jury's award, ending a 20-week trial that began in early May, is the largest ever in a pollution case and the second largest in a civil case in the United States. The largest award in a civil suit was the $10.5 billion verdict against the Texaco Corporation in a contract dispute involving Pennzoil in 1985. The case was later settled for $3 billion. The largest civil award ever in an environmental case was the $470 million that Union Carbide paid in a court in India in the poisoning deaths and injuries of thousands of residents of Bhopal, India, in 1984.
After the verdict, Exxon stock, which had dropped during the trial, rose $1.50, to $60.25, within minutes. Analysts said the company could pay the $5 billion award without suffering significant harm; the plaintiffs had asked for $15 billion. Exxon last year reported net earnings of $5.28 billion on revenue of $111.2 billion for all of 1993. [Page 10.]
In the moments after the verdict was announced by Judge H. Russel Holland in Federal District Court in Anchorage, lawyers for the fishermen and other Alaskan plaintiffs said they were elated.
"That is enough money that when it gets distributed among the fishermen and native Alaskans, it will allow them to make a new start on their lives," said Brian O'Neill, a 47-year-old lawyer from Minneapolis who led the plaintiffs' trial team. Depending on the precise number of plaintiffs, which is still unclear, each could receive about $100,000, if the money was evenly divided.
Patrick Lynch, a lawyer from Los Angeles and one of Exxon's lead trial lawyers, said the verdict would fuel debate about the fairness of huge punitive damages.
"I think it's a common experience in the law right now that punitive damage awards by juries are a problem, because it is difficult to give a jury meaningful standards to determine in money what will constitute punishment or deterrence," said Mr. Lynch, noting that Exxon had already spent $3.4 billion cleaning up Prince William Sound in Alaska and taking other measures to respond to the Valdez spill.
The verdict against Exxon and Mr. Hazelwood came after 13 days of deliberation by the jury of eight women and three men in the last of three phases of the civil lawsuit. The trial, which began on May 2, became a test of endurance for everyone involved, especially for the jury.
In the first phase, which ended in June, the jury determined that Exxon and Mr. Hazelwood were reckless, setting up the third phase of the trial, which ended yesterday.
The second phase, to determine compensatory damages, ended in August with the award of $286.8 million to the plaintiffs.
The huge jury award could mean that the 80 law firms working for the plaintiffs could share roughly $1 billion and perhaps more, although the award of legal fees will be decided in part by Judge Holland, said Gerry Nolting, a 39-year-old lawyer from Minneapolis who has worked on the case for over five years. The rest will be shared by some 10,000 fishermen, 4,000 native Alaskans, and perhaps 20,000 other clients.
If the award were divided equally, those plaintiffs would receive roughly $100,000 each. "The actual amount will depend on the total number of plaintiffs, which isn't known yet, and the judge will have to approve all allocations," Mr. Nolting said.
The punitive damages award caps a legal and economic battle that began when one of the world's most modern supertankers ran aground after midnight on March 24, 1989, on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil. The spill was the largest ever by a tanker in North American waters and killed thousands of otters, birds and other creatures.
Mr. O'Neill said the punitive damages judgment was enough money to indicate to both Exxon's stockholders and its senior executives that changes in the company's way of doing business were warranted.
"We've done half of the work, and that was to uncover what happened in this incident and to expose Exxon for what it is -- uncaring, reckless, and greedy," said Mr. O'Neill. "Now it's up to Exxon shareholders who ought to be saying: 'Why did our company do these things? Why didn't our company tell us they did these things, and why haven't they been frank about telling us about the trouble they were in with this lawsuit? Why did the chairman of the board and the president get bonuses the year of the spill?' There is a whole series of questions that stockholders ought to be asking about the way Exxon treats people."
Exxon said the largest damage award in its history was in 1983, in a case involving overcharging on crude oil sales during a period when a complex formula of Federal price controls was in effect. The award was $1.6 billion, the company said, but Exxon has recovered part of that from other companies that shared an interest in an oil field Exxon managed.
In explaining why he thought the verdict was unfair, Mr. Lynch said: "I think it is common sense that any business that has suffered over a $3 billion payout will do everything in its power to avoid having a similar occurrence. The record of Exxon's diligent effort to avoid anything like this recurring is very strong. Adding a $5 billion award on top of that doesn't serve any of the purposes that punitive damages were intended to serve."
To make the case easier for the jury to understand and consider, Judge Holland had divided the case into three phases. But both sides introduced so much economic, biological and legal information that a computer and video system was installed in Judge Holland's courtroom to help the jury keep track of it. So many television monitors were perched on tables and desks that the courtroom looked like a network news studio.
Mr. O'Neill's primary tactic was to turn the trial of the world's richest energy company into a statement about the behavior of the company's top executives, among them Lawrence G. Rawl, the former chairman, and Frank Iarossi, the former president of Exxon Shipping Company.
In the first phase, the jury sided with Mr. O'Neill and determined that Exxon and Mr. Hazelwood had acted recklessly.
But in the second phase, the jury seemed to accept Exxon's evidence that skimpy supplies of herring and salmon in the region could not be entirely attributed to Exxon. They awarded some 10,000 fishermen $286.8 million in damages, about a third of what Mr. O'Neill had sought.
Just before the jury's decision in the second phase, Exxon and the plaintiffs' lawyers announced that they had settled one part of the case and that Exxon would pay $20 million in compensatory damages to native Alaskans.
In the third phase, the jury was to decide punitive damages not only for fishermen, but also for some 4,000 native Alaskans, and for several thousand more Alaska residents who contended they had been harmed by the spill.
After the verdict, Exxon's chairman, Lee R. Raymond, issued a statement. "It is excessive by any legal or practical measure," he said. "We will use every legal means available to overturn this unjust verdict, which is not a final judgment. It will be reviewed and we trust it will be modified by the trial court or by appellate courts."
Michael G. Chalos, the lawyer for Mr. Hazelwood, said he also was disappointed in the verdict against his client and planned to appeal. He noted that in August, Mr. O'Neill had urged the jury to award only $1 against Mr. Hazelwood.
"Captain Hazelwood is substantially worse off financially and emotionally than he was before the spill," Mr. Chalos said. "The jury should have followed the recommendation of the plaintiffs or our recommendation to award nothing against him simply because he's been punished enough."
Other trials still await the defendants in the oil spill. A fourth phase in the Federal trial before a new jury is scheduled for the fall. It will hear evidence from crab fishermen and other plaintiffs not included in the larger trial who are seeking $300 million in compensatory damages.
In addition, a jury in state court is deciding whether to award compensatory damages to Alaskan native corporations that have contended they lost $120 million because of the oil spill.


GRAPHIC: The Exxon Valdez ran agound on March 24, 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of oil. By May 18, the oil slick had spread 470 miles southwest.
 
Chronology: "For The Record: A Disaster's Trail . . . And Exxon's Repayment"
 
1989-94: Exxon pays $2.1 billion in the cleanup effort, plus and additional $1.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties and settlements of claims filed by 11,000 residents and businesses in the Prince William Sound region.
 
July 1993: Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, of which Exxon is a part owner, agrees to pay fishermen and Alaskans involved in the Federal trial $98 million in damages.
 
June 13: Federal jury finds that Exxon acted recklessly in the Valdez spill. This verdict clears the way for the jury to award punitive damages later in teh summer.
 
July 25: Exxon agrees to pay $20 million in damages to a group of 3,500 villagers who said the oil spill ruined their food supply. These villagers represent about a quarter of the plaintiffs in the Federal trial.
 
Aug. 12: A Federal jury orders Exxon to pay $286.8 million in compensatory damages to more than 10,000 Alaskan fishermen who said they lost hundreds of millions of dollars of income after the spill. This ends the second phase of the Federal trial.
 
Sept. 16: In the thrid phase of the Federal trial, the jury orders Exxon to pay all the plaintiffs - about 34,000 fishermen, natives and others - punitive damages of $5 billion. The former captain of the Valdez, Joseph J. Hazelwood was ordered to pay $5,000.
 
Still to be decided: A jury in Alaska's state courts is considering whether to order Exxon to pay $120 million in damages to Alaska native corporations and municipalities. Finally, in the last phase of the Federal trial, a new jury is expected to decide this fall whether to award $300 million in damages to crab fishermen and other specialized groups who did not fit in any of the larger groupings from earlier phases in the Federal trial.

HEADLINE: With Factories Near Their Limits, Inflation Fears Are Rising Again

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Industrial production and factory operating rates rose sharply in August, the Government reported yesterday, raising the possibility of a new surge of growth in the American economy, and with it higher inflation.
The latest reports, suggesting that the manufacturing sector is operating nearly at full throttle, came despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep a lid on economic growth -- and on inflation -- by raising interest rates five times since February. 
 The bond market, where interest rates are set, reacted with fright to the new threat of inflation. Traders quickly pushed the yield on long-term bonds to 7.77 percent, the highest level in more than two years. And stock prices fell. [Page 37.]
For some economists, the August industrial production report signaled that there were pockets of strength in the economy that might keep the pace of growth moving ahead, if not this year then next. These pockets, mainly exports and automobile sales, could raise economic growth to a level that would push the inflation rate steadily higher. It is now less than 3 percent.
"When Europe and Japan are both expanding briskly, as is likely in 1995, then their purchases of American goods and services are likely to make our economy surge," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant.
That view did not go unchallenged, however. "I think this is the last surge of industrial production," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "We have been surveying our members. About half are building up inventories because of strong demand, mostly in autos, and half find themselves stuck with goods they cannot sell."
Cutbacks in production would get rid of the unwanted inventories. But in August, instead of cutbacks, industrial production rose seven-tenths of a percent, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday, and the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 84.7 percent of their capacity, the highest level since August 1989. That was up from 84.3 percent in July and 84.2 percent in June, numbers that were themselves revised upward yesterday.
In the last two weeks, conflicting Government data have been cited as evidence one day that the economy and inflation are on the rise, and evidence the next day that they are not.
The Government reported on Sept. 9, for example, that producer prices had jumped six-tenths of a percent in August, a huge increase that aroused great concern about inflation. That concern subsided on Tuesday, when the Government reported that the Consumer Price Index had risen mildly, by three-tenths of a percent, in August. Then on Wednesday, a Federal Reserve survey of the nation's various regions suggested that economic growth was nearing a plateau and that pressure for higher wages, while rising, was still moderate.
This view prevailed again on Thursday when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released its latest survey of manufacturers in the region. The survey showed modest price increases. But the tranquillity was again dispelled with yesterday's reports on industrial production and capacity utilization.
"The bond market has been torn between do we need to worry about inflation or don't we," said Nicholas Sargen, chief investment officer for the Prudential Insurance Company's Global Advisers, a fund that invests heavily in bonds. "The new numbers were higher than anyone had anticipated, so the bond market concluded that we are in for more economic growth and rising inflation."
Whatever the truth, most forecasters expect slower economic growth in the short run, if not next year. The gross domestic product, which measures the nation's total output of goods and services, grew by a robust 4 percent in the 12 months that ended in June. Fifty prominent forecasters estimate, in the latest monthly survey by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, that the economy is currently growing at an annual rate of only 2.2 percent.
But that growth rate will rise next year to 3 percent or more, Mr. Bernstein and some other economists predict. That much sustained growth is beyond the nation's capacity to expand without more inflation, many economists believe.
Attention focused yesterday on the latest capacity utilization number, which measures how close factories are to operating at full capacity. While Mr. Jasinowski and others insisted that economic growth and industrial production were beginning to slow, many people in the financial markets have long held that when capacity utilization reaches 85 percent, shortages develop and manufacturers and retailers find they can raise prices.
That rising inflation, in turn, erodes the purchasing power of the money that has been invested in bonds and other loans. Just the prospect that this might happen prompts these investors to push up interest rates, so that they earn more and thus recover some of the lost purchasing power.
"There is a threshold in capacity utilization through which you move and kick off inflation pressures, and that threshold is 85 percent and we are virtually there," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a bond trading firm. He predicted that the inflation rate would rise above 4 percent next year, unless the Federal Reserve held economic growth below 3 percent by raising interest rates again. Interest rate increases tend to discourage lending in an economy that thrives on credit.
Bond traders in general also concluded that the new capacity utilization figure would help to convince the Federal Reserve's policy makers to raise interest rates at their next meeting, on Sept. 27, Mr. Jones and others said. Before yesterday, the consensus view among bond traders was that the Fed would wait until its Nov. 15 meeting -- after the Congressional elections -- if it acted at all again this year.
"The markets clearly associate high capacity utilization with a jump in inflation," said Mickey Levy, chief financial economist at Nationsbank.
But manufacturers took a very different view. The case for a new surge in economic growth, and with it higher inflation, rests on strength in auto sales as well as rising exports. Indeed, the August jump in industrial production came largely because of a rebound in auto and truck production and a jump of nearly seven percentage points, to 87.2 percent, in the capacity utilization at auto and truck plants.
Auto industry executives, however, insist that capacity is more flexible and expandable than the Federal Reserve's figures suggest, and therefore less inflationary than the bond market's behavior yesterday would indicate.
"These capacity utilization rates don't relate very much to anything we know," said Wynn Van Bussman, an economist for the Chrysler Corporation. "We know each plant's capacity on two shifts, with and without overtime, and what it would be on three shifts, and the Federal Reserve's numbers don't take account of this, so we don't pay attention to them."
The capacity measurement also does not take adequate account of overseas production, Mr. Van Bussman and Mr. Jasinowski argue. Chrysler, for example, is starting production in Graz, Austria, of its popular Jeep Grand Cherokee. That plant will make 45,000 Grand Cherokees a year for European buyers, allowing Chrysler to divert vehicles to American buyers that are now made in the United States and exported to Europe.
Finally, the Big Three -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- insist that they are seeking to hold onto market share won back from the Japanese and that they have therefore held back sticker price increases on 1995 models to roughly the inflation rate, although demand exists for greater increases.
"We are able to stretch capacity, and we have made the decision not to take full advantage of the pricing opportunity," Mr. Van Bussman said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Optimism Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for early September rose to 92.2 from 91.7 in August, people with access to the report said yesterday. The University of Michigan index is based on 100, set in 1966. When the monthly reading increases, consumers are becoming more optimistic about the economy. Since 1966, the record high for the sentiment index is 101, set in March 1984. The record low is 51.7, set in April 1980. The university also said its index of current economic conditions fell to 102.9, from 108.7 in August. The index of consumer expectations, a component of the Government's index of leading economic indicators, rose to 85.3, from 80.8 in August. "It's a surprising mix," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "People seem to be less confident about the present and more confident about the future." The university delays public release of the information for one month.

HEADLINE: Stocks and Bonds Plunge on Inflation Specter

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

 BODY:
In 30 minutes of trading frenzy, the stock and bond markets plunged yesterday morning in response to a Government economic report that raised the specter of accelerating inflation. Both markets calmed by 10 A.M., but the damage was done.
As bond prices dropped, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 7.77 percent, the highest since the end of June 1992 and up from 7.63 percent on Thursday. The spurt in the yield also pushed it out of a trading range it had been in since July. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.53 points, to 3,933.35, after climbing 58.55 points Thursday.
Although traders and analysts predicted a more steady mood in the bond market next week, several said that yesterday's economic report, which showed that manufacturing production jumped more than expected last month, would increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates after its policy meeting Sept. 27. Before yesterday, many analysts had expected the Fed to wait until its November meeting, which is after this year's elections, to raise interest rates again.
The markets were jolted, traders and analysts said, by the Federal Reserve's report on industrial production. The Fed said that factory use reached a capacity of 84.7 percent in August, up four-tenths of 1 percent from the previous month, and matching the highest operating rate since March 1989. Many traders and investors contend that when the production level of America's factories gets this close to full capacity prices begin to rise because manufacturers cannot meet demand.
In the same report, the Fed said that industrial production jumped seven tenths of 1 percent in August, the 15th consecutive monthly advance. This increase was more than many analysts expected.
"I think the reaction was so strong because the conventional view had been that the economy was decelerating," said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "These numbers today shocked that view."
A strengthening economy, Mr. Berner and other analysts said, would almost inevitably spur inflation and encourage the Fed to raise interest rates again in the coming month.
"The economy is growing faster than the markets seem to be comfortable with," Mr. Berner said.
John Lispky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, agreed. "There is no convincing, broad-based sign of any slowdown in the economy at all," he said.
In the bond market, the selling spree began seconds after the Fed released its report at 9:15 A.M., and lasted about 15 minutes, said Jay Goldinger, market strategist at Capital Insight of Beverly Hills, Calif.
"This was a slaughter today," Mr. Goldinger said. "It wasn't painful; it happened so quickly."
The stock market, flush from Thursday's big gain in the Dow, followed suit. The Dow plummeted 40 points in about 15 minutes after the opening of trading at 9:30 A.M., then recovered slowly over the remainder of the session.
Trading was unusually heavy, with 410.8 million shares exchanging hands on the New York Stock Exchange for its sixth-busiest day ever and second-busiest day this year. On March 18, the exchange saw more than 461 million shares traded. Yesterday's decliners outpaced advancers by 1,418 to 739.
A contributing factor to the high turnover, traders said, was the coinciding expirations of equity and index options and index futures, known on Wall Street as a day of "triple witching."
But the talk of the bond market was the surprising jump in industrial capacity utilization. Several analysts said they regarded 84 percent to 85 percent as a threshold that marks new inflationary pressures.
Yesterday's report brought an extra surprise, traders said, by revising July's rate of capacity utilization to 84.3 percent -- the highest level since August 1989 -- from 83.9 percent. The additional four-tenths of 1 percentage point increase in August meant a total increase of twice that, or eight-tenths of a percentage point -- far higher than the three-tenths of a point increase that many traders had expected.
"There's no magic number," Mr. Goldinger said, noting that capacity utilization reached 84.8 in 1988, and went as high as 89.2 percent in 1973. But as usual, expectations, and not history, were what drove the market, he said.
Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg in New York, said: "It was much, much higher than the market expected. It just reached into all those fears about inflation that were there already."
Mr. Liro said he believed that the Fed would act by mid-October to raise interest rates. He said he thought the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, might decide soon after the Fed's Sept. 27 policy-making meeting to shift rates.
The Fed has already raised interest rates five times this year to stave off inflation, and the Federal funds target rate has climbed to 4.75 percent from 3 percent.
Mr. Liro and other analysts said they expected relatively calm trading in the bond market next week, in part because the economic data scheduled to be released -- new housing starts and trade figures -- did not usually push bond prices significantly.
"I think it will be a consolidation week," Mr. Liro said.
The stock market slide may have been touched off by the bond market's selloff, but it also followed Thursday's gain that was attributed mostly to a computer-driven surge in the last minutes of trading.
At the market's close on Thursday, the Dow reached 3,953.88, its highest level since Feb. 3, and within reach of its peak of 3,978.36, set on Jan. 31. After yesterday's fall, the Dow was still ahead for the week by 58.54 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.62 points, to 471.19. The small-stock Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.75 point, to 777.91.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index was off 1.65 points, to 259.77. The American Stock Exchange was one of the few indicators that rose yesterday. It gained 0.12 point, to 459.86.
General Motors led the Dow industrials down, losing 1 1/8, to 50 1/2. Caterpillar fell 1 3/8, closing at 56 3/8.
But not all stocks fell. I.B.M. rose 1 1/4, to 71, in active trading after Goldman, Sachs set an $80 target within 6 to 12 months for the computer giant. ITT rose 1 7/8, to 82, after saying it planned to seek buyers for its ITT Financial unit.
American Income Holding jumped 3 7/8, to 34, on news that a unit of Torchmark would acquire it for $35 a share. Torchmark ended up 3/4 at 43.
McGraw-Hill Inc. was heavily traded with shares up 2 7/8, to 76 1/2, a high for the year. The New York Stock Exchange said it had asked the company if it had any news to report and that it had declined to issue a statement. Analysts have speculated that a large European publisher, possibly Bertelsmann A.G. of Germany, might be interested in taking over McGraw-Hill.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks In Hartford If Cars Use Clean Fuel

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Two months ago, Connecticut staked out a new position among states with air pollution problems: it opened up its checkbook.
 Under a new law that energy experts say is only the second in the nation, Connecticut announced that any commercial fleet operator that wanted to convert vehicles from ozone-spewing gasoline to cleaner fuels like natural gas or electricity would get a big tax break. For every dollar spent on conversion or on building alternative fueling stations, fleet owners could deduct 50 cents from their corporate profits tax. After the conversion, the new fuel would be exempted from the 31-cents-a-gallon state fuel tax.
 
 Only Oklahoma, a natural-gas-producing state with few smog problems, has done anything similar. It also gives the 50 percent deduction.
 Connecticut's move has paid off. The nation's largest commercial fleet operator, United Parcel Service, said in August that it would convert more than half its 925 vehicles in Connecticut during the next 24 months to compressed natural gas. The highest proportion of converted U.P.S. trucks elsewhere is 15 percent, in Oklahoma. A coalition of environmental and gas industry groups has also formed to push next year for a similar law in New York, using Connecticut's as the prototype.
 Connecticut officials said that they would not know how many companies were using the program until tax receipts had been counted, but they estimated that the tax breaks might cost $1 million in revenue.
 The story behind this law reveals how business, government and environmental concerns can occasionally line up in surprising and enthusiastic agreement. The law also underlines the deep policy differences between Connecticut and some of its neighbors that have been at the heart of the long regional debate about carrying out provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act.
 New York and Massachusetts, for example, have both passed laws that will require certain percentages of low- or zero-emission vehicles to be sold over time. Connecticut officials have repeatedly rejected the idea of mandates, arguing that the market, if encouraged and prodded, can and should carry the freight.
 "They obviously believe it's good for their respective states, but we in Connecticut have a little bit different philosophy," said Timothy R. E. Keeney, the State Commissioner of Environmental Protection. "From the Governor on down, we don't believe that a sales mandate is a productive way to proceed."
 Cooperation with businesses is at the root of the new Connecticut law. In fact, it was proposed by U.P.S., which told lawmakers in Hartford this spring that it wanted to accelerate its use of alternative fuels, but needed help defraying the costs.
 It can cost up to $8,000 to convert a typical U.P.S. truck to compressed natural gas, said Robert K. Hall, the company's automotive engineer. He said that total would take nine or 10 years to recoup without incentives,
 "It takes about 50 percent to put a dent in the cost of the project, to make it feasible," he said.
 Lawmakers completed the rest of the economics equation themselves: if a big company like U.P.S. was ready to leap, could a local industry perhaps be fostered in converting vehicles and making alternative-fuel equipment? And if Connecticut acted first, might it gain an edge?
 The result was an environmental bill that even a chamber of commerce president could love. It sailed into law with bipartisan support.
 "It shows that these clean-air technologies are not pie in the sky, that they're doable," said Senator Michael P. Meotti, a Democrat from Glastonbury who, as co-chairman of the Transportation Committee, is a sponsor of the bill.
 Some applause about the new law has been cautious, however. Several environmental and energy groups said they feared that the new law could encourage politicians to say that the state was now doing enough in dealing with ozone problems.
 "Someone might say that, and I suspect someone will," said John R. Garrison, chief executive of the American Lung Association. But Mr. Garrison added, "I wouldn't do anything to discourage implementation of this law because it is an important first step."
 Whether the Connecticut law will in fact be an economic boon is also uncertain. When the legislature was debating the bill this spring, the prospects of jump-starting an alternative-fuels business seemed bright: the state was courting a Massachusetts company that planned to expand in Connecticut, building electric cars in Waterbury. The company later backed out, however.
 New York, where at least 2 percent of all vehicles offered for sale must be zero-emission cars by 1998, was able last month to attract a California electric car company, U.S. Electricar, that said it would assemble its vehicles in the Syracuse area. The company's president said that the prospect of a guaranteed market was a major factor.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN WITH HAITI;
Aristide's Offer: A 'Vision of Democracy'

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the address today in the White House by the exiled President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to a group of leaders from 24 countries whose troops would join in a peacekeeping operation in Haiti:
President Clinton, Mr. Vice President, distinguished Prime Ministers, Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Secretary of Defense, honorable ministers and ambassadors, Mr. Secretary General of Caricom, General Shalikashvili, Mr. Gray, special adviser to President Clinton, in the name of our nation, I extend to you my warm and sincere greetings. Honorable Prime Ministers of the Caribbean, may I say that we are indeed happy and proud to be surrounded by you. 
 I thank you, this microcosm of the world community, for traveling with the people of Haiti on our long and difficult journey toward democracy, for the commitment of the world community to help us end the suffering and oppression of the people of Haiti, and to restore democracy.
President Clinton, thank you for an historic message last night. Your words were an eloquent testimony to the suffering endured by our nation during these past three years. Your homage to our friends and fallen heroes, Father Jean-Marie Vincent, Minister Guy Malary and, to the thousands of victims of the coup d'etat echo deeply in our heart. By understanding this suffering, you nurture our great hope, the hope for peace, the hope for reconciliation.
Standing with the people of Haiti in this vision for democracy, you affirm the great sense of patriotism buried deep in the souls of all Haitians. Listening to your message, we as Haitians are reminded of a shared history rooted in dreams of liberty and freedom. Thank you and the people of the United States once again.
We thank also the international community for embracing our hope for peace and reconciliation. In your remarks last night, President Clinton, you documented well the history of the international support for Haiti, diplomatic efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of American States to secure the sovereign rights of all Haitians to decide the future of our nation.
 
'Reconciliation Among All'
 As you said, there is no question that the people of Haiti want to embrace democracy. It is the restoration of democracy that will bring peace for all, reconciliation among all, respect and justice for every single citizen. With the implementation of the Governors Island Agreement, we will realize this vision. That is why we fully support United Nations Resolution 940, the ultimate vehicle to achieve the goals of democracy outlined in that agreement.
We thank the people of the United States for taking the lead in this multinational effort under Resolution 940. The solidarity that the international community has expressed in this effort through the participation of our dearest neighbors in the Caribbean and our brother nations representing the continents of Africa, South America, Europe and Asia is the solidarity that will be needed tomorrow as together we work to uplift Haiti.
As we move towards democracy and toward this new Haiti, we move democratically, we move justly, fully aware that peace and stability will return to our nation only because we have pledged to reconcile our society. This is why I granted the political amnesty authorized by Article 147 of our Constitution. This amnesty is part of the reconciliation and rebuilding process. Let our commitment to peace be our contribution to democracy. We will not allow artificial lines to divide us.
Members of political parties, members of Parliament, civilians, members of the military, all Haitians, let us stand to rebuild our nation. How great will it be to in future days to begin our education program to reduce our 85 percent illiteracy rate. Already we plan to build one new school in each of the 565 rural districts of the country, restore and resupply 1,000 of the existing schools, and train 3,000 teachers.
How great will it be to in future days to begin implementation of emergency health measures in a nation where there are only 1.8 doctors for every 10,000 Haitians, and 1.5 hospital beds for every 1,000 people.
How great will it be to in future days to begin planting trees to ward off a total ecological disaster that threatens the nation. Since the onset of the political crisis, an additional 7,500 trees are cut down each month. In 1978, our forest acreage stood at 7 percent; by 1989, that number was reduced to 1.3; and if this way continues, by next year all of our forest may disappear.
How great will it be to in the next few days begin with our plans for the professionalization of the army, to no longer suffer under a 7,000-person army controlling 45 percent of the national budget.
 
'We Say No to Vengeance'
 Members of the military, we will create jobs for you. You will not be isolated. You are the sons of the land, the nation's citizens. Stop the violence. Do not be afraid. We say no to vengeance, we say no to retaliation. Again and again, day after day, we will continue saying no to vengeance, no to retaliation. Let us embrace peace. When? Now. Is it too late? No, the time is now. The restoration of democracy will bring peace for all, reconciliation among all, respect and justice for every single citizen. Stop the violence. Do not be afraid. We say, and we will be saying again and again, no to vengeance, no to retaliation. Let us embrace peace. When? Now. Is it too late? No. The time is now.
In a new and democratic Haiti the rule of law is indispensable. In a few days after the restoration of democracy we will start to reform our judiciary with the assistance of a separate civilian police for this reformed judicial system; we will offer a constitutional avenue for recourse to equity, national academies to train our magistrates, our 83 judges, 348 justices of the peace, 43 court clerks, and 147 officers of the Bureau of Vital Statistics, will restore confidence in these beleaguered institutions.
With political stability will come economic rebirth. The decline in national production by over 10 percent in 1992, the alienation of foreign investment, the accelerated depreciation of our currency, and the 60 percent rise in inflation must be reversed. The security and stability that will come with the restoration of democracy will create the environment where growth is possible.
The 140,000 jobs lost in the industrial sector will be restored. In this environment of political stability, commitments from the international community will allow us to advance an economic policy that ensures an open market and opportunities to prosper.
As during our first seven months in office, we will again close the floodgate of Haitian boat people. Our refugees will stay at home happy to participate in a prospering economy, to share in the resources contributed by our vibrant diaspora. They will work to rebuild the nation. Once again, we will move from misery to poverty with dignity. Yes, indeed, we will move from misery to poverty with dignity. The restoration of democracy will bring peace for all, reconciliation among all, respect and justice for every single citizen.
 
True Test of Democracy
 The swift and determined action of the international community pursuant to Resolution 940 will lead us quickly towards creating this climate of peace as the December legislative elections approach. A successful election to which the world is invited to observe will set the scene for an historic event: the December 1995 elections.
As I have said before, the true test of a democracy is its second free election when power is transferred freely and constitutionally. Therefore, I will not be, and cannot be, a candidate. We anxiously await the international community to support that effort as they presently support the restoration of democracy today.
On February 7, 1991, the day of my inauguration as President, I said that not another drop of blood must fall in Haiti. Today, again, I repeat this call to peace and reconciliation, which will flourish with the restoration of democracy.
President Clinton, last night in your historic and vibrant message, you told the people of my nation that you come in peace. With you and with every individual participating in the international effort in Haiti, we share the desire for peace as together we move towards Haiti, a Haiti where, like in South Africa, we will celebrate a new beginning.
A new day is coming for Haiti. May it come soon.

HEADLINE: In Korea, Fears of North Bring Crackdown on Left

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
There is great anticipation of Saturday night's premiere of one of South Korea's most expensive films, "The Taebaek Mountains," the movie version of a best-selling novel.
But what in most countries would be an occasion to admire stars and starlets has been transformed into a dramatization of the growing anxieties over the possible opening of North Korea.
Right-wing groups have threatened to bomb the theaters that show the film, which takes a sympathetic look at a band of Communist guerrillas before and during the Korean War, and the police have sought an indictment of the novel's writer, Cho Jung Rae, on charges that his 10-volume epic is pro-Communist. 
 The South Korean Government has repeatedly cracked down on Communist sympathizers. But this attack is against a novel that has been on the market eight years, and it comes from a Government led by President Kim Young Sam, who built his career fighting authoritarian rule and stormed into office 18 months ago on a campaign of reform and democratization.
The attempts to silence Mr. Cho are just part of a broader crackdown on left-leaning professors and students that began after the death in July of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's Communist leader.
Students have been arrested for possessing allegedly pro-North Korean literature. Two professors were nearly indicted for writing a popular textbook that looks at South Korea through a Marxist lens, but a judge rejected the prosecutor's charges. Government officials are expressing worries that the United States may provide concessions to a North Korean Government still bent on military conquest of the South.
On the surface, this represents an odd shift in policy. Some experts see the death of the man most responsible for the division of the Korean peninsula as a potentially hopeful sign. North Korea, whose economy is crumbling amid its isolation, has accelerated its discussions with the United States on opening its nuclear plants to inspections and has even taken steps toward establishing diplomatic relations with Washington.
The outcome of the talks remains uncertain. But these events have unsettled rather than soothed the South Koreans, prompting what some see as a return to the old, repressive policies. "I think it is unimaginable in a democratic society to put something that is the product of one's imagination on trial," said Mr. Cho, the novelist. "You have to remember that this is fiction. It is stupid to mistake it for reality."
But to hear political leaders in South Korea tell it, Kim Il Sung's death exposed conspiracies to overthrow one of the most prosperous and stable countries in East Asia.
"The Government was simply reacting to the shock of the people, who were surprised to see the large body of students with leanings toward North Korea," said Lee Sei Kee, chairman of the governing Democratic Liberal Party's policy committee. "We were actually being very careful. But then people started to say, 'Why are you being so soft?' Then the media took up this view. That was why we changed our position."
To some degree, of course, North Korea is a real threat. It has not launched any military forays across the demilitarized zone for years, nor has it initiated terrorist attacks like the bombings of the early 1980's. But it still has nearly a million troops along the 151-mile demarcation line.
There is also evidence that the Pyongyang Government has spent the last decade trying to develop nuclear weapons and that it has stockpiled enough plutonium to build one or two bombs.
The weapons would most likely be used against South Korea, yet it is the United States that is negotiating with Pyongyang on halting the program. Despite the presence of 37,000 American troops here, many South Koreans see this as a Korean issue. Yet the North Koreans have refused to meet with South Korea on the matter because they do not recognize the Government.
Thus, what lingering fears the South Koreans have about American intentions have come into the open, at times in the form of anger at Robert L. Gallucci, the senior State Department official leading the American delegation in the talks.

HEADLINE: U.S.-German Group Plans an American Academy for Berlin

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Sept. 16

 BODY:
A group of prominent Americans and Germans has announced plans to build an American Academy here, part of a web of new projects intended to assure that this city's ties to the United States do not weaken over the years ahead.
The academy, which is to open in 1996, would be a center for scholars from the United States, Germany and Central Europe. Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, and Richard von Weizsacker, the former President of Germany, are the honorary chairmen. 
 "By sparking an American rediscovery of Berlin's treasures, the academy can tap a rich, centuries-old tradition of cultural and scholarly interaction between Americans and central Europeans that was cracked by World War II and the cold war," organizers of the project said in a statement.
The withdrawal last week of the last United States troops here has unsettled many Berliners, some of whom do not realize that the Americans are not bringing their troops home from all of Germany. To show that the United States intends to remain active here, American officials have begun projects that are envisioned as the basis of a new and stronger economic, political, cultural and strategic relationship.
"We have got a massive effort under way to demonstrate to Berlin, to Germany and the world that we are not pulling out in any real sense," Richard C. Holbrooke, the outgoing United States Ambassador to Germany, said in an interview. "All that is leaving Berlin are a couple of hundred soldiers who are no longer needed.
"There's a real strength and a real emotion in the feeling that Germans, and especially Berliners, have toward the United States. Logically, these ties will gradually attenuate and become more distant. Memories of the airlift and 'Ich bin ein Berliner' will fade like Gettysburg and the Battle of the Bulge. What we are doing now is building a series of institutions that will guarantee that this relationship doesn't fade along with the memories."
Recently, an exhibition documenting the United States role in Berlin opened at an American cultural center in downtown Berlin, and a new Allied Museum was dedicated in a building that was once the American military's movie theater.
Senior government and business leaders from both countries held a two-day conference last week that was billed as the one of highest-level meetings of German and American business and political leaders ever. A smaller-scale meeting in Leipzig next weekend is intended to allow American, German and central European business executives to discuss prospects for cooperation.
Among other programs that are about to begin here are several aimed at eastern Germany, where during the Communist era many people were given only a partial view of the American role in Germany. A center is being planned in Dresden to train eastern German schoolteachers in methods of teaching English.
Over the coming months, as Germans observe the 50th anniversary of various events leading up to and following the end of World War II, the United States will sponsor discussions in eastern Germany intended to present fuller historical background than was available to most people there during the decades of Communist rule.
"The American role at the end of World War II was never explained in East Germany," said Dan Hamilton, an American scholar who is working as an adviser to the United States diplomats here. "Or it was explained in a way that just wasn't true."

HEADLINE: Private Banks on a Short Leash in Taiwan

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
For years, Chao Yuan-chi stood patiently in long lines to cash his checks at one of Taiwan's big state-owned banks. Once a banker in the United States, he was convinced that there had to be a better way.
"I was so mad," he recalled. "The service was so bad. They made us wait a long time. I said to myself, when I open a bank, we would not let people wait. We'd have a clean lobby, very efficient." 
 Now Mr. Chao has had his chance. Five years ago, in a first effort to liberalize the country's highly regulated and heavily state-dominated banking sector, the Taiwan Government decided to grant licenses to any new private banks that could demonstrate assets of at least 10 billion Taiwan dollars, then a bit less than $400 million. The Government expected a handful of applications. It received 20 and approved 15 immediately, and one more thereafter.
"Nowhere in this world in a small economy like Taiwan's would you see 15 new banks with $400 million in equity opening at the same time," Mr. Chao said. "When that happens, the pie is only so large and the competition becomes much fiercer, and services become much better."
But for all their purported independence, the private banks in Taiwan have been kept on a short leash, not only by the Government, whose heavy-handed regulation extends down to approval for individual automatic teller machines, but also by the major business conglomerates that bought into many of the banks and now exploit them as cash cows.
The Pacific Group, a manufacturing, construction and retail conglomerate, provided much of the assets behind the Dah An Commercial Bank, where Mr. Chao now works as executive vice president.
"Most of the new banks were invested in by conglomerates," said Norman Yin, a professor of banking at National Chengchi University. "Even though each investor was supposed to be limited to 5 percent, many of these groups used a variety of street names to put in money. So as a result, one group can own 50 percent of the capital and so have control of the bank."
Though banking regulations were designed to prevent it, the private banks have sometimes been used by their conglomerate parents as easy sources of funds, according to banking analysts. And many private banks were forced into more marginal, and problematic, lending.
By contrast, the state banks benefit from long-term relationships with customers. The Bank of Taiwan, the country's second-largest bank, enjoys the free use of money as the depository for local government funds on which it pays no interest. As a result, the state banks remain highly profitable, if still inefficient, with an average return on equity of more than 20 percent, while the private banks have averaged a meager 4 percent.
Still, Wu Rong-i, the president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, a private research group with both government and private sector projects, said the new private banks were the seed of more aggressive competition.
"It's very strong pressure on existing banks," Mr. Wu said.
During a recent boom in Taiwan's property market, the private banks were making loans for construction projects, usually accepting real estate as collateral. But banking analysts say the valuations of the property often overstated actual worth.
Professor Yin referred to one bank, which he declined to name, that had lost nearly $100 million on a bad loan when the bank found itself with real estate not worth its collateral value.
"Many of these banks have marginal customers and nonperforming loans," Professor Yin said, though Dah An Commercial Bank has largely avoided the problems afflicting many other new private banks.
Mr. Chao of Dah An said that Taiwan's central bank was concerned about the loan portfolios of private banks and intended to exercise closer controls over them.
"Right now they think too much of our money goes into the construction industry and not enough into manufacturing," Mr. Chao said. "We have already received some letters from them asking us to put more emphasis on loans to manufacturers."
Both the Ministry of Finance and the central bank exert stringent controls over the private banks, determining how many branches they can open each year and where, dictating the number of cash machines they can install across the island and approving the qualifications of all managerial personnel. Mr. Chao said such regulations on the private banks seemed to be growing.
"If we want to put in a new A.T.M. machine," Mr. Chao said, "we have to apply to the Ministry of Finance a year in advance. If I want to get a computer terminal in my customer's office so they can do wire transfers on their own terminals, that's not allowed here."
But the governor of the central bank, Liang Kuo-shu, defended the tight controls.
"The Ministry of Finance is very concerned about the concentration of power because these banks are owned mainly by big business groups, so they are putting on more and more regulations," Mr. Liang said.
As for the Government's control over growth of the private banks, he said, "If they have too many branches in the early stages, they will lose money."
Mr. Chao acknowledged that he was frustrated by the Government's impulse to retain control over the private banking sector, but he said that Dah An's banking assets had nonetheless increased. "We are changing things slowly," he said. "We cannot change things overnight. They want to liberalize the financial system here in Taiwan and they are doing it step by step."
At the main branch of Dah An here, next door to the newly opened Hard Rock Cafe, tellers sat, not behind little windows so common at many state banks, but at low counters. A single line of customers, moving rapidly, fed toward the tellers.
"You see," Mr. Chao said, as he headed out to a lunch of soupy noodles, "it's pretty quick now. No one is waiting forever. I think our service here is indeed better than the state banks. They are improving, but there is a difference."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Tumbles on a Report Indicating Strong Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against most other leading currencies yesterday, following bonds lower after a Federal Reserve report convinced many investors that factory use was rising fast enough to spur inflation.
Bonds suffered their biggest one-day loss since May after the Fed said yesterday that factories, mines and utilities operated at 84.7 percent of capacity in August, the highest level since 1989. The Fed also said industrial output jumped a bigger-than-expected seven-tenths of 1 percent in August. 
 "A lot of people are shocked at the strength of the economy, and the inflation that goes along with it," said David Durst, a currency-options trader at Bear, Stearns & Company.
For many traders and analysts, the Fed report confirmed a belief that the central bank had not raised interest rates far enough or fast enough to control inflation.
While higher interest rates in the past have tended to bolster the dollar, declines in the bond and stock markets in recent months have dragged down the dollar, as traders see demand for American assets weakening.
"Strange though it seems, what the dollar needs is weaker figures," said Nick Parsons, with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5445 German marks from 1.5460 marks late Thursday. It fell to a three-week low of 1.5315 marks, before recovering amid speculation, apparently unfounded, that the Federal Reserve was buying dollars to stem the slide. Banks that do business with the Fed said the central bank made no purchases yesterday. The Fed declined to comment.
The dollar fell to a two-year low of 1.2700 Swiss francs, from 1.2848 Swiss francs on Thursday. The British pound jumped to a 16-month high of $1.5869, from $1.5628 on Thursday. The dollar fell to 98.95 Japanese yen, from 99.50 yen on Thursday.
The small recovery by the dollar, even though bonds remained lower, indicated to some traders that the currency's eight-month slide might be coming to an end.
"If the dollar hasn't bottomed yet, it's close," said Marc Chandler, director of research at Ezra Zask Associates, a Norfolk, Conn., hedge fund with $180 million of assets.

HEADLINE: More Police for Same Taxes In Suffolk's Proposed Budget

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Sept. 16

 BODY:
The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, proposed a $1.6 billion budget today that he said would hold county property taxes at their current level through next year.
The budget includes money to hire more than 100 police officers, increasing the size of the county force to 2,701, the highest level since 1989, said Mr. Gaffney, a Republican in the third year of a four-year term. 
 But he said the county would have to ask the State Legislature for permission to extend the part of the sales tax that expires at the end of 1995 to insure future financial stability.
An added percentage point in taxes was approved in half-point increments in 1991 and 1992, producing revenues that allowed Mr. Gaffney to avoid major property tax increases while closing a budget deficit that exceeded $99 million three years ago.
The 1 percent tax will produce $138 million in revenues in 1995, according to a projection released today.
The Democratic leader of the county legislature, Maxine S. Postal, said Mr. Gaffney's claim that he was not raising taxes was "an absolute misrepresentation" because of continued dependence on the higher sales tax. "Whether it comes out of your left pocket or your right pocket, it's still taxes," Ms. Postal said.
Suffolk retains 4.25 percent of the 8.5 percent sales tax collected in the county. The state gets 4 percent and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority gets a quarter of 1 percent. The combined rate is one of the highest in the nation and is matched only by Nassau County in the state.
Sales tax revenues will rise 3.8 percent this year and 4.4 percent in 1995, the county executive's budget officials projected. Mr. Gaffney said the increased rates showed the county was "recovering slowly from the recession."
Mr. Gaffney said the county had reduced the number of welfare recipients to 16,941 cases as of last month, from 18,600 cases in August 1993. He said this continued a downward trend at a time when other counties, including Nassau and Westchester, were reporting higher caseloads.
He said the trend showed the success of a Suffolk program requiring able-bodied recipients to work in assigned jobs as a condition for receiving benefits. "People must understand that the rule in Suffolk County is if you can work, you must work," he said.
Mr. Gaffney said he was dropping a controversial plan to lease the county's fleet of some 8,000 cars from a Maryland company. He said he and county legislators were now discussing "a blend" of bought and leased cars to replace the aging fleet.
In a public split with Mr. Gaffney, Republicans in the county legislature said the leasing plan would waste millions of dollars. Mr. Gaffney said he was forced to consider leasing because the legislators would not appropriate money or sell bonds to buy cars.
Donald R. Blydenburgh, a Republican and the presiding officer of the 18-member legislature, declined today to comment on the proposed budget or on Mr. Gaffney's revised position on car leasing.

HEADLINE: BANKING;
Secured Credit Cards Are Attracting Savers

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
LOOKING for a high rate of return on their savings, some people with stellar credit histories are using what has been known as the credit card of last resort.
The cards, called secured credit cards, were designed for people with a bad credit record (or none at all) who failed to qualify for a conventional card. For a minimum deposit, generally $300 to $500, a Visa or Mastercard is issued with a matching line of credit. 
 But a growing market for secured cards has heightened competition and created what can be attractive deals. Some card issuers are offering such high rates on the amount on deposit that they have lured savers instead of borrowers.
"A good number of our card holders admit getting a Key Federal secured card primarily to earn the high interest on savings deposit," said Robert M. Bouza, senior vice president of Key Federal Savings Bank in Havre de Grace, Md., one of the largest issuers of secured cards. "Even if they don't need our secured card to rebuild or establish a good credit record, these people are using our program as a high-interest savings vehicle -- and getting a major credit card as a bonus."
Ruth E. Susswein, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a nonprofit group in Salem, Va., said that restoring credit was still the main use of secured cards, but "using a secured card for savings is becoming more common."
Card holders in the Key Federal program currently receive an annual yield of 4.06 percent on up to $1,000 on deposit and 4.57 percent on amounts of $1,000 to $5,000. Interest is compounded and credited quarterly. On the down side, the bank requires a $400 minimum deposit, charges a $35 annual fee and 18.9 percent interest on balances.
The Associates National Bank of Dallas pays 5.1 percent on deposits above $250 and charges a $45 annual fee for its card. The Orchard Bank, in Portland, Ore., pays 5 percent on deposits of $2,500 to $15,000 and charges no fee.
For comparison, the average money market account had an annual yield of 2.45 percent this week and the average one-year certificate of deposit had an annual yield of 4.39 percent, according to Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla.
The number of secured cards in circulation grew to 925,000 last year from just 145,000 in 1988, and is expected to reach 1.2 million by the end of this year, largely because millions of Americans damaged their credit records in the recent recession and want to rebuild a credit history.
No longer the province of shady finance and credit repair companies, the cards are issued by many major banks. The number of issuers has grown to 400 from 35 in 1992.
Robert K. Heady, the publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, said that the cards were a good deal for issuers, who take little risk because the line of credit is secured by the deposit. Card issuers also get income from application and late fees, and usually charge high interest on purchases, often 18 to 21 percent. Moreover, many secured cards have no grace period, meaning interest accrues from the date of purchase.
"Secured cards make sense for people who pay off their credit card debt every month or don't use the credit line and just use it for savings," said Robert B. McKinley, the president of RAM Research, a credit card researcher and publisher in Frederick, Md. "They can pay better rates than bank accounts, even when taking an annual fee into account."

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Sept. 16

 BODY:
For his comeback, Meldrick Taylor hired an unemployed Philadelphia street vendor to impart an Eastern spiritual approach to his daily training regimen, which now includes isometric exercises, yoga and whole-grain foods.
The former world champion also enlisted the services of the man who trained him as an amateur, Willie Rush, to help him return to his professional roots, when he utilized blinding hand speed and effective counterpunching. 
 "I've done everything I've had to do to prepare for this man," he said today.
Taylor (32-3-1, 18 knockouts) resumes his rivalry with Julio Cesar Chavez (91-1-1, 77 knockouts) Saturday at the M-G-M Grand.
If Taylor is prepared, the same might not be said for his opponent. Chavez was fined $500 by the Nevada State Athletic Commission for being 25 minutes late to today's weigh-in. When he finally arrived, Chavez appeared woozy and afterward guzzled a bottle of Gatorade as if he hadn't had anything to eat or drink all day, raising speculation that he had struggled to make the 140-pound limit.
Commission officials said he weighed 140 -- the same as Taylor -- but would have to be checked by a doctor.
Although Chavez's World Boxing Council superlightweight title is for the taking, he and Taylor's reputations have taken a beating the past two years, and as such it has dulled the luster of the rematch.
Taylor is a 3 1/2-to-1 underdog according to most Nevada betting lines, yet Chavez's trainer, Emmanuel Steward, likens their rematch to other rematches between legends gone south.
"Ali and Frazier were past their primes, and yet they put on a war," Steward said. "Same with Tommy Hearns and Sugar Ray Leonard. They brought out the best in each other. Meldrick never forgot what Julio did to him."
Pop in the tape of their fight four years ago and watch as Taylor had Chavez's number for much of 11 3/4 rounds. That one quarter of a round was costly for Taylor, though. Chavez unleashed a flurry of blows in the final 20 seconds, backing Taylor into his corner and finally sending him to the canvas.
He rose slowly and responded even more slowly to Referee Richard Steele's count. Steele stopped the fight amid chaos with two seconds left, and Chavez remained unbeaten and Taylor's career was set back a millenium.
Taylor was knocked out twice in 1992 vying for world titles, and this year Chavez was beaten by Frankie Randall. Questions surrounding this fight have more to do with whose career is over than who is stronger:
*Is Chavez nearing the end after losing once, drawing once and going down for the first time in his career against Randall this year? Or can he find one last great performance before a partisan gathering in the M-G-M Grand Garden Ballroom?
*Will Taylor's new-found discipline remove the stigma attached to him as a fighter whose weight balloons between bouts? That's where Shiloh Bey comes in. Bey, who has worked as a street vendor in Philadelphia, has provided spiritual and nutritional guidance to a few lesser-known fighters and convinced Taylor to follow his advice.
*Should either keep fighting?
"I'm older, but I am still good," the 32-year-old Chavez said through his interpreter, Gladys Rosa.
Taylor, who is 27, said: "I was never a shot fighter. I don't know why people said that."
 
PUNCH LINES
 EVANDER HOLYFIELD disputes reports that he was denied medical clearance to fight again. "I plan to fight by the end of the year," he said. It's not like Reggie Lewis, where I'm trying to find someone to let me fight. It's not that serious a problem." Although he has not applied for a boxing license, he said he planned to do so after planning his comeback strategy. Holyfield, a two-time heavyweight champion, was told by a physician not to fight again after discovering a heart ailment shortly after his loss to MICHAEL MOORER.

HEADLINE: In 'Prince Igor,' a Lesson in Western Ways

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

 BODY:
For five singers from the former Soviet Union and its satellites, appearing in the New York City Opera production of "Prince Igor," Alexander Borodin's pageant of Russian nationalism and pagan temptations, carries the echo of once-learned lessons, lately discarded.
"We were taught, we were raised, to be poor," said Dejan Miladinovic, the director of the Belgrade National Opera, who is directing "Prince Igor." "And when nothing worked, we blamed the capitalists, the Americans, the wealthy people." 
 These days, the director and the singers from the former Eastern bloc, who tonight are to appear in the second of their four performances at the New York State Theater, are eager for the coveted chance to earn hard currency. And yesterday's villains have become today's role models.
In many of their home countries, opera is in disarray, struggling to survive. Ticket prices are up to the equivalent of $1, a small fortune in economies where a monthly salary may run from $5 to $10, and audiences are down. Governments that once guaranteed careers, that spent freely on productions and coddled performers, have all but eliminated subsidies, while their economies lack the tradition and tax laws to promote private philanthropy. "And we haven't got the wealthy people to do that," Mr. Miladinovic noted.
"Please God," interrupted Vladimir Grishko, a tenor from Kiev, Ukraine, crossing himself like any number of medieval Christians portrayed in "Prince Igor," "I'll become wealthy and healthy."
"Me, too," Mr. Miladinovic added quickly.
With the rules of the game having changed on them in mid-career, opera singers like Mr. Grishko and Sergei Zadvorny, a bass who plays the Polovtsian warrior Khan Kontchak, have found their lives in upheaval, for better and for worse. They now have to scramble for auditions and bookings in the West; hire language and voice coaches, who were once supplied by their opera companies, and school themselves in the cost effectiveness of agents and publicity people.
And they must wrestle with the travails of international careers and constant travel. Mr. Zadvorny's arrival from Odessa, Ukraine, was delayed for two weeks because of his difficulty in obtaining a visa, an all too common experience that prompted Mr. Miladinovic to propose a special passport that would grant artists, like diplomats, special travel status.
"Before, when our opera was under the tight control of the government, I wasn't known in Europe and America," said Valery Alekseyev, a baritone who sings the title role. As one of the more fortunate singers, Mr. Alekseyev spends most of his time away from his home base at the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg. "If I had no tours here, I couldn't live on the salary I have in Russia alone. I wouldn't have enough money for food."
Valentin Peytchinov, a Bulgarian bass who portrays the barbarous Prince Galitzky, noted that the time and the money once devoted to staging an opera in his country were something "companies here could only dream about." Still, Mr. Peytchinov, who left Sofia in 1988 to study at the Juilliard School, has no plans to return to Bulgaria, for which he harbors a fair store of resentment.
His musical education came free, compliments of the Communist Government, but when he received an invitation in 1987 to study in the United States, he was denied permission to leave Bulgaria. A friendly diplomatic official finally arranged his departure the next year; it was a hasty escape, just before his wife gave birth to their first child, and began a forced three-year family separation while he attended Juilliard. "Can you imagine how I suffered?" the singer asked, his eyes filling.
Mr. Grishko, who has been on the road for the last six months or so, said he would not bother singing in the cash-poor cities of Eastern Europe. "What would be the interest of a singer going to my country?" he asked. "Ten dollars a month? No thank you. I will not sing."
Next year, he will appear in "La Traviata" at the Metropolitan Opera. Asked which role he would sing, the tenor crossed himself once again and looked skyward. "Alfredo, thank you God," he said.
It is perhaps a measure of the economic desperation and rise of nationalism in Eastern Europe that, apropos of nothing, Mr. Peytchinov hastened to point out that many American singers perform regularly in Europe. "That's why you shouldn't feel we are taking anybody's place by performing here," he said.
Christopher Keene, the general director of City Opera, said he had recruited the singers from Eastern Europe, collectively referred to as "the Russians" by the City Opera's American members, through a series of coincidences after he had decided to stage the opera in the original Russian. The last time City Opera did "Prince Igor" was in 1969, and the production was in English.
Mr. Grishko and Oksana Krovytska, a Ukrainian soprano who has sung with City Opera for more than two years, were already known to Mr. Keene. Mr. Alekseyev's agent happened to call Mr. Keene to say the baritone would have some time free before appearing across the Lincoln Center plaza in the Metropolitan Opera's production of "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk." Mr. Zadvorny, who was in New York visiting a friend, asked to audition on a whim, and was accepted. The same day, Mr. Peytchinov also auditioned successfully, Mr. Keene recalled.
Guido Ajmone-Marsan, who is conducting the music for "Prince Igor," noted that the performers were happy for the chance to work in the West, and brought authenticity to the company's first Russian-language performances. But he noted that because of the ample rehearsal time they were used to back home, the singers were not in the habit of arriving for rehearsals with music memorized and entrances and exits charted.
On the first day of rehearsals, Mr. Ajmone-Marsan recalled, only the American cast, which will take over for the first of its three performances on Oct. 4, and Ms. Krovytska were present. "We did all the ensembles, and there were no mistakes," he said. "Everyone knew their entrances and their pitches. And then the Russians came in. At their first rehearsals, a lot of mistakes were made, even by the people who had sung it before."
The longtime cocoon of Eastern Europe was artistic as well as political, and left opera untouched by the naturalistic dramatic style that evolved in the West, he added. The result is often performances that come across as stilted, what one American singer called "stand up and deliver your aria" singing.
"I think an opera like this could gain by more up-to-date acting," the conductor said. He suggested, though, that perhaps ignoring the dramatic demands of their roles allowed for more heartfelt musical interpretations. "Maybe because they don't pay such clear attention to the musical things, they give their personality more free rein in the way they're singing."
When they are not rehearsing, the foreign singers spend much of their time here shopping, in the fine tradition of Europeans East and West. Melanie Sonnenberg, an American mezzo who plays the Polovtsian princess who lures Prince Igor's son from his father, said that CD's and opera scores in the original languages seemed particularly prized by the visitors.
The only East European who reported a full opera house back home was Mr. Miladinovic of Yugoslavia, which has been isolated from the rest of the world under United Nations sanctions. "I suppose it's a normal reaction: the audience is seeking a live word or a live melody," he said. "At this time, people want to establish communication."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Far Away From Home, But Not Far From CNN

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR 

 BODY:
Some images linger from a recent vacation in Berlin:
Sad faces of children, often crying, fleeing places like Rwanda and Bosnia. Commercials for contour pillows and shiatsu-massage devices. Weather reports covering the globe in 150 seconds or less. Larry King tenaciously pursuing every new tidbit in the O. J. Simpson case and badgering guests for assurances that this is really one helluva story. 
 Welcome to the world as packaged by CNN or, more precisely, CNN International, the Ted Turner-owned service that aims to reach each and every one of those satellite dishes sprouting up across Europe, Africa and Asia. As something of a news junkie, I must confess that having CNN International available 24 hours a day at the flick of a switch was bewitching. If nothing else, I could take my time about picking up that day's copy of an English-language newspaper.
In the United States, CNN has profoundly altered the basic dynamics of television news, most notably by ending the virtual monopoly that the three commercial networks had on supplying news clips to local stations. CNN has forced the news divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC to scurry to keep up. And now, just about every hour on the hour, CNN International can provide travelers and other interested viewers with a fairly good sense of what is happening around the world. But the old problems of television news remain. What too often emerges is little more than a headline, tied precariously to "visuals" that are repeated to the point of stupefaction.
Perhaps the most blatant example during my several weeks in Berlin was the story of political unrest in Nigeria, with the military rulers keeping in prison the man who a year ago had evidently won a democratic election to lead the country. Each time the story came on, as the military accelerated its general crackdown, CNN International viewers were treated to a file clip of the election victor surrounded by smiling and triumphant supporters. The image, far from the reality of the leader's being imprisoned, had the unsettling effect of being almost lulling.
Of course, the daily logistics of CNN International are daunting. I had to keep reminding myself that the 9 A.M. "World News Report" with Ralitsa Vassileva was coming out of CNN headquarters in Atlanta at 3 A.M., a time when hard news is generally not breaking. But even seemingly straightforward reports at that hour can be confusing. On one segment dealing with developments in Northern Ireland, Brendan O'Leary, an author and a professor at the London School of Economics, appeared to be interviewed live by Ms. Vassileva. Yet in the next hour, another anchor, Stephen Cole, opened his Ireland report saying, "Earlier, I spoke to an expert, Brendan O'Leary," whose remarks were then repeated.
Confronted with the challenge of covering the world, complete with some sort of appropriate pictures, CNN International can get trapped in silly decisions. One sports roundup, running the standard three minutes, reported the auto-accident death of a Portuguese soccer star with a long shot of two teams, no player clearly discernible, on an unidentified field.
The CNN conundrum is most dramatically reflected in weather reports. We all know they are notoriously unreliable, even on local newscasts. What are we to make of genial weather forecasters skipping blithely over the world's continents in two and a half minutes with a few general trends and temperature readings? One complete report for the United States (which for some reason never includes temperatures): "Storming around the Great Lakes; hot in the Midwest." Talk about useless.
One of CNN's in-house commercials states, "It began with a simple idea: keeping the world informed 24 hours a day." It's obviously not that simple. Ratings have been slipping for the past year or so, buoyed briefly this year only by the Simpson story, which might explain Mr. King's ferocious persistence in pouncing on every new detail.
And then CNN frequently finds itself in the familiar damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't bind. It is sometimes criticized for going live with news conferences that turn out to be less than newsworthy. But that is apparent only after the fact. If CNN failed to cover something that turned out to be significant, the same critics would wail indignantly. In fact, the live special reports this summer, from a Clinton news conference to the Cuban Ambassador meeting reporters at the United Nations, proved to be among CNN's more valuable offerings.
Sitting in Berlin, I watched the extensive local and national television coverage of President Boris N. Yeltsin's arrival in the city to preside over the historic departure of Russian troops. On CNN, the event was for the most part reduced to a brief shot of Mr. Yeltsin arriving at Tegel Airport and smiling exuberantly at well-wishers. Of course, CNN can't cover every story around the world in depth. But a more judicious balance, not to mention a more helpful perspective, certainly isn't out of the question.
Meanwhile, not a day went by without a trip to the local newsstand. All right, I'm prejudiced. Any better suggestions?

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaigns;
Race for Governor: Cuomo Goes After Pataki

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Candidate: Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
Producer: The Garth Group, New York 
 Visual The 30-second advertisement begins with footage from one of State Senator George E. Pataki's early commercials showing Mr. Pataki, the Republican candidate, walking toward the camera. His image freezes, and the word "Untrue" is superimposed across it in bold red letters. Below that is a New York Times headline that reads, "Pataki's Grim Statistics Collide With the Facts." The ad cuts to a shot of Mr. Pataki being interviewed on television. It ends with the words, "George Pataki. Politics as Usual," stripped in white letters across the screen.
Script Announcer: "George Pataki. He's running commercials attacking Mario Cuomo using statements he claims are factual." George Pataki (quoted from his own commercial): "It's a fact." Announcer: "But The New York Times says Pataki's statistics often collide with the facts. And in this commercial, none of Pataki's claims were true. Why say something that just isn't true?" Mr. Pataki (quoted from a June 6 interview with New York 1 News): "In the course of campaigns, people want to win and they say things about their opponents that they may or may not believe." Announcer: "What was that, George?" Mr. Pataki: "That they may or may not believe." Announcer: "O.K. George Pataki. Politics as usual."
Analysis: The commercial marks the third time in two weeks that the Cuomo campaign has sought to use Mr. Pataki's own statements to question his integrity. In this case, the Cuomo camp focuses on a Pataki commercial contending that New York State is No. 1 in taxes, wasteful spending and job losses -- none of which are true, according to Federal labor and census statistics. The Cuomo ad then quotes from a television interview in which Mr. Pataki seems to suggest that distorting facts is a valid campaign weapon. The effect is apparently a double play: Mr. Pataki uses incorrect information, then is heard rationalizing it. The ad's subliminal question seems to be, who could possibly trust such a man?
The Cuomo camp accurately depicts Mr. Pataki's commercial as factually wrong; the Times article shown in the ad pointed out that New York does not actually rank first in any of the categories cited. But the truth is not much rosier for Mr. Cuomo, since New York still ranked high among states in combined state and local taxes, jobs losses during the recession and government spending.
Furthermore, the ad portrays Mr. Pataki's comment that candidates say things "they may or may not believe" as a statement of personal ideology. But in fact, it was offered as a defense of Herbert London, who ran an acrimonious campaign against Mr. Pataki for the Republican gubernatorial endorsement. He lost and then joined Mr. Pataki's ticket as the candidate for state comptroller. JAMES DAO

The Face-Saving Invasion

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN 

 BODY:
It is an inexact art, psychoanalyzing the President of the United States. But with the Administration threatening to enter a military conflict both senseless and unpopular, there is nowhere to look for possible explanations but inside Bill Clinton's head.
Certainly there was precious little enlightenment in the President's speech Thursday on why we could see our way clear to invade Haiti. With a listlessness at odds with his usual sidewalk-preacher oratorical style, Mr. Clinton couldn't drum up one compelling reason that a tiny nation whose economy is in shambles and whose military is a shadow of our own posed a risk to national security. He was reduced to quoting George Bush and referring to Grenada as though it were Guadalcanal. It evoked the movie "Dave," in which the President is impersonated by someone else after he falls ill. Who was that man playing Bill Clinton? 
 From the isolated perch of the Presidency Mr. Clinton has become a leader reviled not only by the Republicans but by many liberal Democrats as well. He is seen as a man who would bargain nearly any principle away. From an unworkable "don't ask, don't tell" resolution of the issue of gay men and lesbians in the military, to the slow erosion of the promise of universal health care from all to many to some, Mr. Clinton has negotiated much and satisfied few.
This perception may have reached its zenith when Garry Trudeau, whose cartoon strip "Doonesbury" is frequently the country's most revealing and most punishing social commentary, began recently to portray the President as a floating waffle.
If George Bush was at least partly motivated in his mano-a-mano with Saddam Hussein by a powerful inner urge to show that he was not a prep school wimp, it seems just as likely that Bill Clinton was trying to show the world Thursday night that the waffle can stand fast. The problem is that he has chosen the wrong time and the wrong place to do so.
The atrocities and deprivation he described in Haiti are horrible and real, it is true. But if they justified military action, we should long ago have sent troops into Bosnia and even Rwanda. (And when Mr. Clinton intoned "executing children, raping women," it sounded as much like New York or Chicago as Port-au-Prince.) The recalcitrance of the military junta is unarguable. But that argues not for military intervention but for continued diplomatic pressure, sanctions that target the well-to-do, humanitarian aid for the poor and economic assistance when the tyrants are overthrown by the Haitian people.
Like the gulf war, fought largely for access to Middle Eastern oil, the Haitian invasion has also been styled an economic necessity. Mr. Clinton said in his speech it would stanch the flow of Haitian refugees, an expensive result of both the political terror and the economic embargo the United States has imposed. A return to democracy would stop the flight, the President suggested, which does not explain why citizens living in peace under the duly elected President of Mexico keep pouring over the border into Texas and California.
Evoking Panama and Grenada, two other foolish mini-wars, Mr. Clinton said that any incursion into Haiti would be "limited and specific." But soldiers would die, and civilians too, particularly if riots spread through the streets of that deeply anti-American island and we were, once again, forced to destroy the village in order to save it.
Perhaps if that was done, Mr. Clinton would have saved face in some fashion. That was the theme of his speech: that he had told the military junta over and over to get out and now he had had enough. American credibility was at stake, he said, although it seemed more Bill Clinton's credibility than the nation's. Besides, to whom must we prove our mettle? The former Soviet Union? North Korea? St. Croix?
The President of Haiti has accused the President of the United States of planning an invasion to assure a Democratic victory in midterm elections. His political instincts are as bad as Mr. Clinton's. With public and political opinion so arrayed against intervention, the very best result from an invasion would be a wash -- no gain, no harm. The best case is that Haiti, like Grenada, would become a bit by Leno, a throwaway line by Letterman, Bill Clinton's little war, remembered less as an exercise in foreign policy than a crisis of self-confidence.

HEADLINE: Calpers Chooses a Less Adversarial Voice

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., Sept. 16

 BODY:
The huge California pension agency, which has been a prime force putting pressure on corporations in recent years to improve their financial performance, appears likely to become less active on that front.
Today the California Public Employees' Retirement System, also known as Calpers, named a new chief executive, James E. Burton, a top aide to several former California politicians. In an interview, Mr. Burton said the fund's role as corporate governance watchdog would become a less adversarial, less public one in keeping with the strategy adopted by the fund and his predecessor of the last two years. 
 "We've matured; we've found a more effective way to handle communications," he said.
With $80 billion in assets, Calpers is the nation's largest pension fund. It has been a leading voice for restive shareholders unhappy with management decisions that held down company stock prices, and in recent years has helped force leadership changes at Westinghouse Electric, I.B.M. and General Motors.
Mr. Burton, the sixth chief executive in the system's 63-year history, made clear that he intended to be a less strident voice for change. That stance also reflects a shift within the shareholder-rights movement.
His appointment to the Calpers post, which pays $110,000 a year, is effective Oct. 1, when he will succeed Richard H. Koppes, the fund's general counsel. Mr. Koppes has served as interim chief executive since the July 11 resignation of Dale Hanson.
Mr. Hanson, who is 51, served for seven years, became a leading shareholder-rights advocate and gained a voice in managing some poorly performing companies whose shares are held by the fund. He left to start his own venture capital fund.
While thoroughly familiar with the corporate governance issues that Mr. Hanson championed, Mr. Burton, who is 43, said, "My intent is to stay focused a little closer to home."
His immediate goal is better service for the fund's one million beneficiaries by improving the use of automation and telecommunications. Planning for future fiscal constraints and a lower interest rate environment is another priority, he said. Another aim is more investment in the state's laggard economy, along the lines of the $1 billion invested in home building the fund made in the last two years.
"His really big job is how to harmonize the state's needs and that of the retirees' legitimate entitlements," said Robert A. G. Monks, a founder of the shareholder-rights movement and now head of the Lens investment fund.
The vast resources of Calpers will be an alluring source of reinvestment capital for politicians eager to replace the military contracting industry, and will force Mr. Burton to walk a political tightrope. "He's in a position to wield a tremendous amount of power," Mr. Monks said, adding that Mr. Burton was particularly well qualified for the task. "My prophecy is he will make as large a contribution to the corporate-governance movement as Dale Hanson."
Since 1992, Mr. Burton had served as the fund's assistant executive officer for investments. Previously he had served on its board as a deputy for the state treasurer and controller. His wife, Suzanne, was appointed in 1991 by Gov. Pete Wilson as the state's deputy director of finance.
Shareholder advocacy has evolved as proponents now frequently win victories and gain a voice in how companies are managed, Harry DeAngelo, a finance professor at the University of Southern California, said, citing the defeat by shareholders of Kmart's plan to spin off part of its specialty-store units. "It's a different world," he said.
The ability of Calpers to influence management is tempered by its keeping half its assets in index funds, A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, said. Without the latitude to sell shares, which a typical dissatisfied shareholder can exercise, "that ties their hands in relation to what they don't like," he said.

HEADLINE: THE BIG CITY;
Color blind

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
It is a mysterious annual ritual. First the nation's fashion arbiters determine the new fall colors and explain why America desperately needs clothes in these hues. Then they make sure not to wear any of these clothes themselves. After all, they live in New York. They don't do colors.
At this fall season's Seventh Avenue shows, the runways featured dresses in shocking pink and lemon chrome and bright mango, but the audience, as usual, looked like a convention of Amish undertakers. Vogue and Harper's Bazaar are proclaiming that "color and shine have returned" and "all signs point to neon," but in the Conde Nast and Hearst buildings, the women who put out those magazines are still wearing coal-colored leggings and miniskirts -- the timeless Elf Angst look. At Charivari, the clothing stores that tout their Manhattan hipness with the slogan "Never Coming to a Mall Near You," the company president, Jon Weiser, explains New York's fundamental law of fashion by paraphrasing Henry Ford: "We like every color as long as it's black." 
 This can't be a genetic trait or a result of childhood deprivation, because many New Yorkers come from multipigmented homes. A friend of mine who moved here from Maine endured repeated gifts of pastel sweaters from his family until he finally went home one Christmas and announced: "No more colors!" Even members of New York's fashion establishment have occasional pangs of discomfort when they leave the city. The editor in chief of Allure, Linda Wells, who grew up in St. Louis wearing Fair Isle sweaters, recalls an unsettling trip back there: "I was wearing a long, austere black dress, nothing unusual. I didn't think anything of it until I got off the plane. I started walking through the airport, and I suddenly realized what I must look like to everyone in St. Louis -- a nun. I kept my hands at my sides. I was afraid people were going to start giving me money."
The black fetish is obviously an adaptive trait, a response to peculiar cultural and environmental conditions. But what exactly is it about black that makes it go so well with New York? There are several theories.
Black is practical. New Yorkers claim they're just being sensible and economical. Black wears well because it hides the chief component of the city, dirt. It flatters most skin tones and makes people look thinner. It can go from the office to an opening to a dinner party. These explanations make sense, but there's a fatal flaw in this theory. If you really cared about being economical and practical, why would you live in New York?
Black is elegant. Eddie Rodriguez, a designer known for his downtown look, sees his clothes as a reflection of urbanity. "New York is America's most sophisticated city," he says, "and black is the most sophisticated color." Certainly black has an elegant history: the classic simplicity of Chanel's "little black dress," the quiet dignity that centuries of aristocrats conveyed by wearing black for their portraits. "The most agreeable color is black," observed Federico Fregoso, a 16th-century Italian courtier. "Who of us when he sees a gentleman passing by wearing a gown quartered in various colors . . . does not take him for a fool or a clown?"
This explanation, though, is also problematic. Black may convey understated sophistication, but how many New Yorkers are understated? And when you consider the black-clad crowd at a downtown club, what's elegant about the earrings piercing their tongues?
Black is unnatural. "Black suits the inorganic quality of the city," says Scott Omelianuk, the fashion writer at GQ. "The only place more inorganic than New York is Tokyo, and there they wear even more black. When you see people in Southern California doing a version of what they think New York hip is, somehow the black doesn't work -- out there they have trees and lawns and sunshine." Although you can quibble with this theory -- industrial towns are fairly inorganic, too, yet the people in them still wear colors -- it's a step in the right direction. The unnatural, lifeless, sinister aspect of black points toward the true explanation for its popularity in New York:
Black is Satan. Anne Hollander, an art historian who has analyzed fashion in "Seeing Through Clothes" and the new "Sex and Suits," believes that her fellow New Yorkers are the spiritual heirs of alienated 19th-century artists like Byron, Baudelaire and Poe. "For the Romantics, wearing black represented the dandyism of the depraved, the mark of an unhappy, solitary person who was possibly in league with the Devil," she says. "New Yorkers are plugging straight into that bohemian tradition because New York is officially an unhappy place. When you get dressed up here, you're dressed for rage."
Like Satan, New Yorkers combine their rage with terrifying lust for power, which makes black all the more appropriate. Like Darth Vader's uniform, black is frightening as well as protective. Even the most kindly New Yorkers recognize its essential function as urban armor against their evil neighbors. When researchers at the Pantone Color Institute did a survey asking New Yorkers what adjective they associated with black, the most common answer was "powerful."
That answer gibes nicely with the research of David B. Givens, an anthropologist whose forthcoming book, "Why Humans Are," analyzes the evolution of behavior. He likens the dark suit to a gorilla's chest-beating display for intimidating rivals. The flair of the lapels and the length of the jacket serve the same function as the gorilla's posture -- making the shoulders and chest look as big as possible -- and the color adds to the effect. "Black makes you seem mysterious and unapproachable," Givens says. "It's the equivalent of putting on sunglasses."
What's worn with the suit is also telling. Exposing the neck is a common courtship ritual in vertebrate species -- from humans to wolves to crocodiles -- because it's a sign of vulnerability. Covering it makes you look more powerful, nastier, which is why downtown New Yorkers who shun the bourgeois tie or scarf have adopted substitute coverings, like the black turtleneck or the air tie look -- a shirt, preferably black, worn without a tie but buttoned to the top.
If you have any remaining doubts about the satanic essence of New Yorkers' clothes, consider one final bit of empirical evidence: an experiment conducted by Linda Wells of Allure a few years ago. She decided to actually wear the fall colors. "I had a pink and orange-sorbet-colored suit," she recalls. "It made me feel happy in the morning when I put it on, but all day long I felt like I was in the wrong place. I felt like I was in a Halloween costume. I felt I had to be nice."
She learned her lesson. This fall season you'll find her in black.

HEADLINE: ART;
The Granddaddy Of Disorder

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: GAETA, Italy

 BODY:
THE SUMMER HAS BEEN STIFLING, too hot, Cy Twombly said, for painting, too full of distraction and diversion. For this American artist, long viewed as a reclusive and elusive self-exile, has been preparing for a major retrospective in New York with what, for him, is a star burst of publicity.
 "You know, this really isn't a thing I do," the 66-year-old Mr. Twombly said in his slow, Southern drawl, gesturing vaguely toward a reporter's notebook and a photographer's lights during one of a series of interviews he has given recently. It was not a grumble or a rebuke. Rather, it was more a shrugging acceptance of the way things seem to be done these days.
The preparations were for Mr. Twombly's largest American retrospective ever, opening next Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. It will include 50 paintings, 37 works on paper and 10 sculptures, embracing his entire career, from 1946 to a few weeks ago. Twombly's is not a household name in the United States, although he gained a certain notoriety when one of his works was singled out by Morley Safer during an attack on modern art on "60 Minutes" last year as a "canvas of scrawls done with the wrong end of a paintbrush." On the other hand, those deceptively childlike scrawls have earned him many devoted followers among artists, critics and collectors. 
 Kirk Varnedoe, head of the department of painting and sculpture at the Modern and curator of the exhibition, thinks Twombly's "purposeful disorder" and "juicy treatment of paint in relation to the body" will appeal to young artists unfamiliar with his work. After all, says Mr. Varnedoe, "he is the grandfather of that approach." And Mr. Twombly provides a living link with the New York School tradition of Pollock, de Kooning and Kline. Like those Abstract Expressionists, who transformed American art after World War II, he deals with heroic subjects -- mythology, history, nature; but he does it in graffiti-like lines and splotches that also link him to as contemporary a phenomenon as the 80's graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.
For many years he was regarded as a remote figure in Europe, less interesting than his friends Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, who were thought to have embraced Pop Art. But this is a Cy Twombly moment. Europe has come back into favor in American art circles, and the admiration accorded him by painters like Anselm Kiefer, Francesco Clemente and Julian Schnabel has only enhanced his reputation.
Today, Mr. Twombly is at a time of his life that is in some ways both turning point and homecoming. The New York retrospective will help determine whether he has laid the critical ghost of his last, poorly received, American retrospective, at the Whitney in 1979. And it virtually coincides with his decision, after almost 37 years in Italy, to take up an American residence again in his hometown, Lexington, Va.
Not that things ever seem to be cast in such literal light in conversations with a man whose sentences sometimes halt abruptly, as if an inner caution had warned him to go no further toward exposing a private core that like his paintings and drawings, does not yield itself to casual scrutiny. One senses a person who has always pursued and fulfilled a largely inscrutable and private agenda.
"I hope it's not much of anything," he said of the retrospective at the Modern. The comment might seem ingenuous if it did not also seem a form of protection against the sometimes hostile art world in New York. "Why would I want more? Why would I want an escalation or something? I have kept my own pace. I think it's a pace the paintings show. I have my pace and way of living, and I'm not looking for something. I'm not looking for taking on something else."
MR. TWOMBLY WAS SITTING in the sunlit courtyard of his hillside house in Gaeta, a coastal city 80 miles south of Rome. He bought the house eight years ago and renovated and rebuilt it, but it still seems slightly unlived in, with dust covers swathing the furniture. Its gray-painted steel door on an unpaved road seems almost monastic, reflecting a desire to control access to his privacy. But the master's sense of humor alters the perspective, breaking through the patrician sternness of facial line that he tends to adopt in photographs. And it makes his spoken words seem far less austere than they sometimes seem in print.
 Mr. Twombly's pace is less hectic than it was. He worked intensely earlier this year -- "I almost made myself sick," he said -- completing a spectacular, four-canvas series called "The Four Seasons" and a huge, 50-foot triptych initially called "The Anatomy of Melancholy" and now untitled. (The former, four large canvases alive with Mr. Twombly's characteristic combination of scattered incidents of drawing, painting and writing, will be at the Modern; the latter will be on view next month at the downtown Gagosian Gallery in New York and will eventually go to the Cy Twombly Gallery, a new museum opening in February near the Menil Collection in Houston. The retrospective will stop there and in Los Angeles and Berlin after closing in New York.) In his studio here, a second version of "The Four Seasons" is taking shape, but it is incomplete and the palettes and paints on trestles and tables around it are dry.
"It's too hot to paint anyhow," he explained. In any event, he added, he was not a "programmed" person and tended not to paint to any kind of fixed routine.
The publicity surrounding the retrospective has recalled some biographical detail about a painter who, by choosing to live in Italy, made himself more obscure in New York than his peers and probably slowed his success. ("If that's the cost" of moving to Italy, he said with a smile, "I'm glad I did it.")
Mr. Twombly was born in 1928 in Lexington, Va. He was christened Edwin Parker Twombly Jr. but inherited his nickname from his father, a professional baseball player who was called Cy in memory of the pitcher Cy Young. Early training as an artist came primarily from Pierre Daura, a Spanish artist who came to Lexington when Mr. Twombly was 12 and introduced the young painter to the modern European tradition in which he eventually came to feel most comfortable. The first painting Mr. Twombly recalls making was a copy of Picasso's portrait of Marie-Therese Walter.
From then on, at art schools in Boston and New York and, in 1951, at Black Mountain College, the fabled avant-garde enclave in North Carolina where he studied under Ben Shahn and Robert Motherwell, Mr. Twombly absorbed expressionist influences and developed interests in Dada and Surrealism. He wrote much later that the main challenge of progressive art "lies in the complete expression of one's own personality through every faculty available."
In the 1950's, Mr. Twombly, along with Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg -- with whom he traveled to Italy and North Africa -- came to epitomize what seemed at the time a reaction against the Abstract Expressionists, who had become the dominant force in American art. The fact that the other two achieved success more rapidly than he does not seem to rankle.
"I don't know what success is," he said. "I don't know if it means notoriety, acceptance or what. I know Jasper Johns was an immediate success. That to me was very clear. Whereas Bob Rauschenberg in reality had a success but more like a notoriety. Sometimes you are a success but not financially.
"It's something I don't think about. If it happens, it happens, but don't bother me with it. I couldn't care less."
(Such sentiments are easier to acquire from a perspective of financial independence. Although Mr. Twombly recalls the days in the late 1950's when his works sold for $100 or so, things are different now. In recent years, Twomblys have brought between $2 million and $5 million.)
Mr. Twombly moved to Italy in 1957 at the age of 29, when the focus of the art world had shifted from Europe to New York. Within two years he had married Tatiana Franchetti, a member of a rich and aristocratic family. The couple had a son, Cyrus Alessandro, who is also a painter. Mr. Twombly casts his move to Italy in the simplest of terms: "Rome in the 1950's was a pretty nice place to come to." But the story seems more complicated. He had visited Italy in 1952 with Mr. Rauschenberg, but on this trip his association with the Franchetti family -- Giorgio Franchetti as well as his sister, Tatiana -- brought with it a distinctive life style among people with a long history of patronage of the arts.
"HE HAD NOT PLANNED A lengthy stay but found Italian life seductive," Mr. Varnedoe wrote in his introductory essay to the catalogue for the retrospective. "He found himself caught up in an unexpected and powerful tide of personal and art-world circumstance, centering on a new nexus of friendships."
That was the beginning of what has frequently been described as a self-exile in Italy, where Mr. Twombly owns houses not only in Gaeta but also in Rome and Bassano, along with his wife's family castle in the Dolomites. In fact, said Mr. Varnedoe, the notion of exile is inaccurate. "He's been back and forth more than one thinks," he said. "The myth is that he left in 1957 and is living in self-exile."
Some of Mr. Twombly's returns to the United States have been singularly unfortunate. A 1964 showing at the Castelli Gallery in New York of the nine-painting series "Discourse on Commodus" was a fiasco. Not a single painting sold. The Whitney retrospective, Mr. Twombly acknowledged, was "not what one would call a success."
Those memories seem to have left an abiding mistrust of what, viewed from Italy, seem the vagaries of the New York art world. "In the 1980's, certainly, art became part of the economy, the entertainment world," he said, and New York "was like General Motors."
"If you really are interested in being in the art world, in getting ahead," he continued, "you are in New York, not in Gaeta."
Clearly, Mr. Twombly has a sense that this time things will be better. "From not caring at all about American painting in the 1950's, Americans think about nothing but American paintings," he said. "I'm the last thing to grab at: that's why they are making something of it."
In conversation, Mr. Twombly seems as much interested in hearing other people's stories as in telling his own, content to listen or to talk about travels in Egypt or Yemen or Greece or the intricacies of the Roman aristocracy or the works of D. H. Lawrence -- just about anything short of the details of his life.
The whole question of his secretiveness seems a puzzle. "I haven't answered my phone in years," he said. "If I want to talk to someone, I call them." Yet he insists he is not secretive: "They use the word, but I'm not secretive. It's not like I'm closed in here. It's not like I'm just with four or five people."
Perhaps the riddle at this period of Mr. Twombly's life is why he has chosen to spend spring and fall in his native Virginia. Up until now, his life, friends, family and work have been in Italy. His persona was built around the Mediterranean. His travels were usually to exotic places, like the Tangier of Paul Bowles in the 1950's or Asia Minor, and he still harbors an urge to visit the ancient sites of Iran. Against all that, Lexington, where he bought a two-story, 19th-century brick house last year, might seem prosaic, though he insists it is "quite a sophisticated little town."
Possibly, it is a sense of advancing years and frailty that has induced the feeling that often surfaces among expatriates -- although he hates the term -- that the adoptive home is no final substitute for native soil.
In two recent interviews, he has compared himself to an old dog going home to die -- a metaphor articulated with an exaggeration of his already pronounced Southern drawl.
"Well, I did say that," he said with a vaguely embarrassed laugh when asked about the remark. "I have taken a house in Lexington, Virginia. After 35 years in Europe and Italy, it was a nice change."

HEADLINE: Queens West Begins With a Park

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
MOST major construction projects begin by digging a large hole in the ground. The Queens West project in Hunters Point began by filling one in.
Earlier this month, in the middle of his campaign for a fourth term, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo formally inaugurated Queens West, which was authorized by the State Legislature during Mr. Cuomo's first term. He was joined by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 The ground breaking was not for the plazas and piers that are to skirt more than a mile of East River shoreline one day. Nor was it for the first apartment tower, which is to rise 42 stories over the 74-acre waterfront site, eventually to be joined by residential buildings on 13 other parcels -- a total of 6,385 apartments -- plus a four-block hotel and office complex that may become the linchpin of efforts to keep United Nations agencies in New York.
Rather, ground was broken for a sliver of a park two blocks from the river's edge.
The park is being created atop 30,000 cubic yards of sand, loam and broken-up concrete now being dumped into an abandoned Long Island Rail Road cut along 48th Avenue, between Vernon Boulevard and Fifth Street. (To visualize that volume, it may help to know that garbage trucks carry 18 to 25 cubic yards.)
With the park under way, the next step will come in late fall with the laying of storm and sanitary sewers, water lines and utility connections to the first development sites.
Also in the fall, Arthur Imperatore's NY Waterway company is to begin rush-hour ferry service between the foot of Borden Avenue on the Queens West site and 34th Street in Manhattan. Plans call for a 500-car parking lot at the landing, near which is the Long Island City station of the L.I.R.R.
In January or February, while surrounding infrastructure is installed, ground may be broken for a co-op apartment building between 48th and 49th Avenues, designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates and Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron. Its developers say the 521 units will be affordable to people earning between $30,000 and $70,000.
Next, work is to begin on a waterfront park called Gantry Plaza, designed by Weintraub & di Domenico and Thomas Balsley Associates. Its centerpiece will be the long-legged gantries over four abandoned float bridges that were once used to transfer freight cars from river barges to the tracks of the L.I.R.R.
It was, however, at the site of the Hunters Point Community Park that officials declared Queens West a reality.
They did so, in part, to demonstrate to Washington that the first apartment tower will not stand isolated. The developers of that building, an American and Japanese group called M. O. Associates, are seeking $89 million in mortgage insurance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"H.U.D. wanted assurances that it was not funding a building without connections or amenities," said Rosina K. Abramson, president of the Queens West Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
Another reason they started with the park was to demonstrate that Queens West would not turn its back on those who already live and work in Hunters Point, a place of modest homes, small business and industry, open sky and a panoramic view of mid-Manhattan.
"The strength of the existing community is very important for the success of the project," Ms. Abramson said.
There are neighbors who believe this vision. Terri Mona Adams, executive director of the Hunters Point Community Development Corporation, said Queens West would revitalize the area with new homes, jobs and businesses on Vernon Boulevard and elsewhere. "And for the first time in years," she added, "the community will have access to the waterfront."
But not everyone has been won over.
"The people who live in the shadow of this proposed project are going to suffer a negative impact," said Joseph Conley, the chairman of Community Board 2, which voted overwhelmingly against the project in 1990. "They're concerned about their life and future existence, especially those who are renting space -- not only residents, but businesses. There's a real fear of secondary displacement."
Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat who represents the area, said that the six voting members of the Queens West board -- from the state, the city Economic Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- "do not know this neighborhood."
"They don't walk the streets," he said. "They don't know the impact of their proposals on the viability of the community."
"The attitude has always been that the agencies coming in are like the old Christian missionaries bringing civilization to the Hottentots," the Councilman said.
THE board of the Queens West Development Corporation (often referred to as QWDC, pronounced "KWI-dic") does include Peter Magnani, representing Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens. Although Queens has no vote, Ms. Abramson said Mrs. Shulman's "desire and interest and input are listened to very carefully."
"Nothing can happen here that she doesn't like," Ms. Abramson said.
And Mrs. Shulman said "anybody who wants to participate is certainly more than welcome" to do so through a task force in her office. "I don't believe the thrust of the project will change," she said, "but the intermarriage between the project and the community can improve. And that's what we're really hoping will happen."
Members of Community Board 2 are hoping that the entire plan is re-evaluated, Mr. Conley said. "We're looking to build sensible projects that are going to integrate with the existing community," he said. "We're concerned about height, bulk and density."
A four-year-old group called the Hunters Point Community Coalition has prepared an alternate plan that calls for buildings no higher than 20 stories, about 35 percent more open space and 75 percent less office space than the official version, and a different street grid to preserve more views to the waterfront from inland blocks.
There seems to be little chance that state and city officials would back off now from a plan that was approved in 1990, during the final hours of the Board of Estimate. The master plan was devised by Gruzen Samton Steinglass and Beyer Blinder Belle.
That plan prescribes the size and use of each site, specifying the maximum floor area and building height, among other things. Three residential towers, including the M. O. Associates project, may rise 390 feet and one of the commercial buildings may reach 400 feet, with 800,000 square feet of space.
"One thing we have to sell to developers is predictability," Ms. Abramson said. "Other than the Buildings Department, there are no other permits a builder needs to get."
"Obviously, we are building big buildings," she said. "But I don't know that that needs to be disruptive or destructive."
"If New York ever breaks the mold," she said, "the place to do it is on the waterfront because the waterfront is unique. After all, this was manufacturing. How consistent was that with a residential neighborhood?"
At the same time, if experience is any guide, the plan will take many years to implement. It will necessarily evolve in that process. "The coalition is going to position itself to be around as those changes get instigated," said its chairman, Tom Paino.
The inevitability of change may be one of the few things about Queens West on which Mr. Paino and Ms. Abramson would agree.
"We're constantly doing mid-course adjustments," Ms. Abramson said. "We're very conscious that while the city and the development community need the certainty of an appoved plan, an evolving city also needs an assurance that there are adjustments that will reflect changing times."
As an example, she cited the creation of the park along 48th Avenue, which was added to the project at the community's request during land-use review. Originally, the railroad cut was to have been used for a below-grade roadway leading into the new development, bypassing neighboring blocks.
Councilman McCaffrey recalled his fear that the roadway would isolate Queens West from the rest of Hunters Point. In contrast, he said, the community park is a "means of integrating the two interests, new and old."
The park plan also calls for the demolition of the Vernon Boulevard Bridge, a small truss span that was recently refurbished by the city. Urging its preservation, the Hunters Point coalition described the "visually pleasing" bridge as a "symbol of the community."
But Mr. Conley, of the community board, said that "in fairness to Rosina and QWDC, that's something the community asked for." As for the preservationists, he said: "It's the 11th hour. Where were you before?"
Construction of the park is related to construction of the first apartment tower, whose site is now luxuriant with chest-high weeds and a few sunflowers growing over rubble.
The developers, M. O. Associates, must demonstrate that they are not building in an abandoned industrial wilderness before they can obtain Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
HERBERT J. STURZ, president of the Trotwood Corporation, a general managing partner in M. O., said the park project had "reassured and pleased" Federal housing officials, as had the commitment by the Giuliani Administration to keep $30 million in the capital budget for Queens West infrastructure.
Should the mortgage application be approved by December, Mr. Sturz said, construction could begin in early 1995 and be completed in about a year and a half.
With Federal insurance, the developers expect to be able to get a 40-year mortgage. Frederick S. Harris, the vice president of Trotwood, said such financing could not be obtained as a rule in the commercial market, where 10-year mortgages are considered long-term. The developers also expect to attract lenders who would not ordinarily be inclined to finance such a project.
"Pension funds, which have zero appetite for risks, have a high appetite for F.H.A.-insured mortgages," Mr. Harris said.
Mr. Harris said a two-bedroom apartment with 900 square feet and a terrace would cost about $180,000 to build. But it would be sold for only $20,000 -- that portion of the cost not met by the Federally insured mortgage. Paying off the mortgage then becomes the responsibility of the co-op owners.
In the case of the two-bedroom example, Mr. Harris said the monthly cost would be about $1,450. Of that, $1,100 would go to pay off the mortgage (and would therefore be largely deductible), $300 would go to operating expenses and $50 would go to taxes and fees. A family with an annual income as low as $52,200 might qualify for the unit.
The developers also have tentative plans for a site south of the first building, between 49th and 50th Avenues: a seven-story building for the elderly and a 32-story tower with market-rate units.
M. O. Associates includes the Trotwood concern, which is owned by the Mellon Bank Corporation; the Zeckendorf Company and the Tekken Construction Company and Tobishima Corporation, both of Tokyo.
Although M. O. owns the property on which both buildings would stand, it must be designated as developer of the second project, as it was for the first, by the Queens West Development Corporation.
Should it be chosen for both sites, M. O. would deed its entire 9.9-acre property to the Queens West corporation and then lease back the development parcels, which together amount to some 3 acres. About 2.7 acres of the site would be used for streets and public space, including Gantry Plaza. The rest, about 4.2 acres, is under water.
Ms. Abramson visited the site of Gantry Plaza the other day with two of the landscape architects, Lee Weintraub and Thomas Balsley. They scrambled with considerable agility over the ruins of the old L.I.R.R. transfer bridges, standing under tall black gantries that framed a postcard-perfect view of the turquoise U.N. Secretariat.
"The strongest marketing tool I have is to make people come out here," Ms. Abramson said, as a fresh wind blew along the shoreline.
Like the recently rebuilt Pepsi-Cola sign at the north end of the Hunters Point site, or the four 275-foot-high smokestacks of the former Long Island City Power Station, the gantries straddling the transfer bridges are emblematic of the industrial waterfront and are to be preserved as a reminder of that history.
"We're doing everything we can to celebrate those structures," Mr. Balsley said.
LOOKING farther down the road, officials envision the site as a campus-like setting that might attract United Nations agencies or the biotechnology industry. Mrs. Shulman said she was having talkes with the Mount Sinai Medical Center about a hospital on the site with housing for medical workers.
In a recent study sponsored by the Ford Foundation and Dag Hammarskjold Foundation, "Renewing the United Nations System," Erskine Childers and Brian Urquhart urged that the U.N. examine the possibility of establishing a common seat for the organization, noting the "evident practical limitations" of the present headquarters site.
"They've always had problems with housing the staff affordably, with security and proximity," Ms. Abramson said. "We can come up with a package so the U.N. can stay exactly where it is and expand. And we can provide more than office expansion. We can provide a community for living."
Mrs. Shulman said the new ferry service would probably increase the interest of the U.N. in Queens West "because they would then have quick access to the mother lode."
For the time being, however, the ferries are intended not for Queens West but for commuters who use the Long Island Expressway or the half dozen L.I.R.R. trains that serve the Long Island City station.
A spokesman for NY Waterway, Vince Baglivo, said service was to begin in the fall but that no specific date had been chosen. He said the ferries would probably run every 15 to 20 minutes between the hours of 7 to 10 A.M. and 4 to 8 P.M. No firm price has been set yet, Mr. Baglivo said.
Opposition to the plan is already evident. "In light of the fact that the community is already an environmental hot spot," Councilman McCaffrey said, "the idea of drawing 500 people into parking their cars in Long Island City is mind-boggling."
One well-known local figure who welcomes the service is Freddie Botur, owner and operator of Tennisport, on the site of what is to be the commercial center of Queens West, just a few steps away from the landing. "The ferry will be tremendous," he said.
Tennisport has 29 tennis courts (13 outdoors, 11 indoors and 5 under a bubble), a restaurant and art gallery. It is soon to get a small golf driving range. Mr. Botur said he could do much more with the property if not for the specter of condemnation.
But even that possibility seems remote today, Mr. Botur said, given the commercial real estate market. "There's about 60 million square feet available in Manhattan and so there is no demand," he said. "I think we're going to be there quite a while."

HEADLINE: Primaries Over, Now Watch the Elbows Fly

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

 BODY:
THE day after Republicans and Democrats settled on their nominees for Governor in the primaries last Tuesday, Lieut. Gov. Eunice Strong Groark moved to secure a prominent place of her own in the race by putting two radio advertisements on the air.
In one, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. growls out his endorsement of Mrs. Groark, warning that "the same old parties and politicians are back at the trough." 
 "Eunice Groark has done the tough business," he says, "while other candidates promise monkey business."
In the second advertisement, John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate, is clubbed over the head with his own quote, "I'm not talking about the past," while a narrator muses over his 108 overdrafts on the House bank when he was in Congress and his highly paid but vaguely described work as a consultant ever since.
"Kind of makes you wonder what other things are in John's past that he doesn't want us to know about," the narrator says.
And so began the main event, an eight-week campaign by four candidates, all of them capable, as Mrs. Groark was serving notice, of throwing sharp elbows to gain room in the crowded field. Elbows will be thrown, for the stakes are enormous for the parties as well as the candidates, especially for A Connecticut Party, the self-proclaimed alternative to politics as usual, as Mr. Weicker departs.
But voters could be pardoned for thinking there are enough differences to debate on their merits among Mrs. Groark; Mr. Rowland, the easy winner of the Republican primary; William E. Curry Jr., the State Comptroller and upset winner of the Democratic primary, and Tom Scott, an anti-income-tax crusader.
Mrs. Groark, after all, is wholeheartedly, almost defiantly, defending the Weicker administration's record, including the personal income tax, which shifted much of the state's tax burden from business to individuals in 1991. That shift, she says, made Connecticut more competitive and helped it emerge from recession, and any future tax cuts should also benefit business.
 
Some Firsts
 She is also offering Connecticut not only its first all-female top ticket, with Audrey Rowe, Mr. Weicker's Commissioner of Social Services, as her running mate, but also, in Ms. Rowe, its first African-American candidate for Lieutenant Governor.
"John Rowland's talk of repealing the income tax does not help business," Mrs. Groark said, "and Bill Curry's talk about cutting property taxes doesn't help either. There are two ways to run a race. You can run to win or you can run to win to govern. I'm doing the latter."
Mr. Rowland has promised to eliminate the income tax in five years, cutting the $9.3 billion state budget to do without half of the $2.8 billion annual income tax revenue, and counting on an improving economy to make up the rest through increased revenue from other taxes.
Having first won public office as a 23-year-old Reagan Republican in 1980, he now is trying to reach beyond the party with a theme of lost values and lost freedoms awaiting Republican redemption.
Describing his childhood in a Waterbury neighborhood on primary night, he said the smell of burning autumn leaves symbolizes for him "the way this country used to be. Now you can't burn leaves in your backyard, you can't talk to your neighbor, you can't go downtown at night."
 
Reducing Government
 Why? "The government is telling us what to do all the time," he said, not quite promising to legalize leaf burning, but pledging to reduce government regulation. He also vows to make streets safe by executing the worst criminals and putting two-time violent offenders in prison for life.
Mr. Curry, meanwhile, is proposing to keep the income tax but to find $1 billion in property-tax relief for homeowners and businesses. He also offers himself as a reformer, opposed by his party leadership in the Democratic primary, who can cut the cost of government by restructuring and making it more efficient, and who doesn't want politics as usual any more than Mrs. Groark.
The public voted for that kind of change in 1990, he says, but Mr. Weicker hasn't delivered it.
"My strategy is to go and do what we have been doing," he said on primary night, "putting on the table what people want, a concrete blueprint for dealing with the problems of a stagnant economy, unsafe cities, an unresponsive bureaucracy and a political system that is driven by money."
Winning a primary challenge, however, has its untidy side. Mr. Curry opposes permitting casinos outside Indian land. But his running mate, chosen by party leaders at the convention, is Joseph P. Ganim, the Mayor of Bridgeport and a vocal advocate for a casino there.
The fourth candidate is Tom Scott, a former State Senator and radio talk-show host who has crusaded against the income tax. His campaign is based on a promise to repeal the tax within four years, but he also attacks government in general, without the soft glow that Mr. Rowland cultivates.
 
Confusion Ahead
 With so many people in the race, confusion about who stands where may be inevitable. "Right now you've got three Republicans and a Democrat," State Senator John Larson said Tuesday night, pledging his support to Mr. Curry after losing the Democratic primary to him. Both Mr. Scott and Mrs. Groark were once Republicans.
Mrs. Groark, however, sees the Curry victory splitting the Democrats "wide open; he becomes the spoiler." And Mr. Rowland, she says, has been wounded by Mr. Scott, who will draw off diehard Republican income-tax foes, and by his primary opponent, Secretary of the State Pauline Kezer, whose attacks on his integrity Mrs. Groark has now taken up.
Mrs. Kezer, in her campaign, also contended that Mr. Rowland was too conservative to win a statewide election, too much like Mr. Scott.
But Republican leaders say they see Mr. Rowland squarely in the center with Mrs. Groark. Mr. Scott is isolated on the "extreme right fringe," said the Republican state chairman, John Mastropietro, and Mr. Curry, a liberal supported by labor unions, is on the "extreme left fringe."
No wonder elbows are likely to fly, when the greatest danger on a crowded political spectrum can come from being associated with the candidate right next to you.
And this is the year that Democrats hope to recover from their 1990 disaster, that Republicans hope to win the Governor's office for the first time since 1970, and that A Connecticut Party will learn whether it has life beyond the singular term of Lowell Weicker.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Going Public;
A Veteran Realty Company Takes the Market Plunge

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT took longer than anyone expected -- the offering was postponed three times -- but on Aug. 25 the Cali Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust that includes Cali Associates' 12 office buildings and one apartment complex, hit the market.
Cali, based in Cranford, N.J., sold 10.5 million shares at $17.25 a share -- a mild disappointment to a company that had hoped to sell 9.179 million shares at $18 to $20. Still, the offering, combined with the proceeds of a separate financing supplied by Prudential Securities, the new REIT's lead underwriter, yielded enough to pay down much of Cali's debt and have cash left over. 
 By forming the REIT, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Cali has done more than just follow the real estate industry stampede to the equity markets. It has, in effect, taken the company public. Instead of owning a dozen buildings and a company, Cali's top executives now own about 25 percent of the REIT. And at an old-line company like Cali, the willingness to make that sort of switch is a sure sign that a new generation of management has taken over.
The three men who started the company -- John J. Cali, his brother Angelo and their boyhood friend Edward Leshowitz -- are all in their 70's and ready to step, if not out, then to the side. The new management team is Brant Cali, 40, John J.'s son; John R. Cali, 47, Angelo's son, and Thomas Rizk, 37, a lawyer and old friend of Brant's who is the company's chief financial officer.
The REIT was clearly their idea.
"When Cali was built," Mr. Rizk said, developers could get rich bank loans using nothing but the planned building as collateral. Today, he said, "only well-run REIT's provide good access to capital."
It is this desire for fresh growth funds that trumpets an impending strategic change. One of New Jersey's largest real estate developers, Cali Associates has, in its 45 years, developed nearly four million square feet of commercial and industrial space, 2,000 one-family homes, 1,800 rental apartments and 1,000 condominium town houses. But over the last decade it has been divesting more than growing.
When it became clear that rent control was not going away, it converted most of its rental units to condominiums. (The only rental building left, a 325-unit complex in Delran, N.J., is the REIT's only residential property.) It sold numerous office buildings to other developers wanting to get in on the booming New Jersey market. When Schering Plough, originally slated to be a tenant in Cali's 150,000-square-foot building in Union City, offered to buy the building, Cali agreed, even though other tenants were ready to move in.
The divestment strategy hasn't kept the recessionary wolves totally at bay -- the company posted a net loss of $ 1.06 million in 1993. But Cali did not lose any buildings to its lenders, its cash flow has remained high and it could have continued servicing its debt.
"The three seniors could have lived happily on the incomes from the buildings, but we want to take this company forward," John R. Cali said. "The real estate market is on the way up, there are properties we have an eye on, and it was either do the REIT or lose all the opportunity the market is offering."
In one sense, taking in outside investors brings the company full circle. Back in 1949, John and Angelo Cali and Ed Leshowitz invested some money in a residential development company. When they started scrutinizing the company's operations they did not like what they saw.
"They were not delivering good quality homes," Mr. Cali recalled.
As passive investors there was little they could do. So the three established Cali Associates and built homes themselves. For each new project, they insisted that the project managers they hired invest some of their own money in the projects. That way, they figured, each project would be run by someone with a vested interest.
AS Cali grew, it hired its own architects, leasing agents, accountants, lawyers. Only two things stayed the same: It insisted that project managers act as equity partners. And it held its focus to northern and central New Jersey, a market the partners felt they could monitor.
And monitor they did. In 1969, responding to a regional scarcity of good office space, Cali built its first office property, 13 Commerce Drive in Cranford, N.J. In the early 1980's the Calis built housing along the relatively new Interstate 280, assuming -- correctly -- that the highway would ease the area's commuting nightmare.
Cali soon mastered the art of synergy, using its residential business as a feeder for its office business and vice versa. When it realized that many of the people moving into Cali homes were self-employed professionals commuting to Newark, Cali built office buildings closer to their homes. When it noticed that people in its office buildings had long commutes to work, it built housing nearby.
It also kept a close eye on the competition. If a potential tenant seemed to be eyeing a competing building with favor, Cali would pounce with news that the rival did not have enough security guards, or didn't have insulated glass on its windows. If the competing building was owned by a syndication or partnership, Cali would stress its hands-on personal management. If the competing building was in the control of its lenders, Cali stressed its financial stability.
"We know the area, we know our tenants, we know the competition," the elder John Cali said. "We know what to stress, when."
In fact, many Cali buildings are tangibly different from the competition. Most are energy-efficient. And many were designed with fancy atria, waterfalls, manmade lakes, parks and other amenities.
"We always tried to differentiate ourselves from competitors who specialized in dullsville," the senior John Cali said.
But Mr. Cali's taste is not universal.
"I had a tenant refuse to move into their building in Roseland because they thought the waterfall was too loud, and I've had others who say they really prefer the more staid leather-and-wood look," said Seena Stein, president of Newmark Partners, a New Jersey brokerage.
Indeed, some tenants move in despite, not because of, the design amenities. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, which occupies half of 95 Christopher Columbus Drive, Cali's flagship building in Jersey City, moved in five years ago when the building was still under construction. The soaring atrium, the indoor plantings -- none of that impressed the firm.
"Because of the atrium, our technology group doesn't have a window to the west," said Gates Hawn, the financial firm's chief operating officer. "Our people are here to work, not sit in the lobby, and we don't have one customer who cares about trees."
STILL, Mr. Hawn is not looking to move out. He notes that the building is a "smart" building, where every floor is raised, and where complicated wiring and cables can be changed in an hour. The location, with its easy access to midtown and downtown Manhattan, is a major plus. And, he says, "the Calis are good, responsive landlords."
Indeed, brokers who deal with the Calis say their renewal rate is high.
"Even in the recession you just never thought, 'Oh, the poor Calis, they have all this empty space,' because they didn't," Ms. Stein said. Donald Eisen, manager of Cushman & Wakefield's New Jersey branch, reacts similarly. "Their buildings are built well and they have good tenant relations, and that's all that's important," he said.
What happens at the buildings now remains uncertain. Inevitably, tenants and brokers who are loyal to the first generation will be dealing with the second. And now that the company, through the REIT, is publicly held, Brant and John R. Cali and Thomas Rizk will be responsible not only to its tenants and its lenders, but to shareholders as well.
Culturally, that will be a sea change at Cali. After 45 years of operating privately, the company will be managing in a fishbowl, with shareholders scrutinizing every move.
The new generation professes to be unworried. "You can't allow a remote collective consciousness to destroy your ability to make decisions," said Brant Cali. But veteran Cali-watchers are waiting to see how the younger Calis and Mr. Rizk perform under the new ground rules before they make any predictions.
"The older men have stood the test of many years, but the new generation has not earned its spurs yet," Mr. Eisen said. "And until you give young people their head, you don't know what they can do."

HEADLINE: The Soup Kitchen Is Not Just a Phenomenon of the Cities

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
THE center of scenic Old Saybrook, a popular shore town that more than doubles its population in summer, is always busy on Saturdays no matter what the season. Cars pass in endless streams along both sides of its wide and divided Main Street, a pattern only broken when one veers swiftly into a just-vacated parking space. The street has an aura of late 20th-century commercial bustle and prosperity coupled with the earlier American charm of three stately churches and some homes that date to the 18th century.
It also has two soup kitchens. 
 That fact would probably amaze casual visitors to the town, and even some of its residents. The soup kitchens do not receive a great deal of publicity and certainly do not fit into a Chamber of Commerce image of the community.
Soup kitchens in Old Saybrook? Next thing you know, there will be one in Essex, the even more upscale town just up the river. As a matter of fact, there are four soup kitchens in Essex now. And another in quaint little Chester, also upriver, where some residents proudly display a bumper sticker: "Chester, We Know Where It Is." And another in Clinton, a town down the shore a piece from Old Saybrook.
The soup kitchens are modest affairs compared to those in cities like Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport. None of them operate full time and they have clientele that differ in major respects from those in the cities. But they do illustrate a major point about life in Connecticut today: In the midst of plenty, there is also poverty.
"The people who come to us are not homeless or addicted, although we have a few who are alcoholic," said Robert P. Little. "A lot of them are just unemployed, or unemployable. Thirty percent of them are senior citizens, mostly women whose husbands did not leave them well enough off to survive without help. We have single mothers, some with many children."
And some, he said, are the people who are hurt first when the economy goes bad: the undereducated, the illiterate, the untrained, the poor who just get poorer. Towns like Old Saybrook and Old Lyme do have, he said, pockets of poverty tucked here and there, out of sight.
Mr. Little is a retired executive from the Southern New England Telephone Company. For the past two years, he has been the volunteer, unpaid chairman of Shoreline Soup Kitchens. The board is made up of four Protestant clergymen, a rabbi, six lay people and Mr. Little, who is Catholic. "We're an interfaith group and we have a simple aim. We chose to feed the hungry," he said.
Shoreline Soup Kitchens began five years ago, said Eleanor LaPlace who has been one of its leaders from the start, when First Baptist Church in Essex solicited suggestions on programs the church should undertake. The only one that survived, she said, was for a soup kitchen, to be held once a week, on the theory that some people might be hungry in a town with a reputation for affluence. "And people actually were hungry," she said. "These are the poor that people ignore because they don't see them."
The first meal served at the church only attracted seven or eight people, Mrs. LaPlace recalled. But the need was obviously there and the figures kept growing.
 
A Hot Meal Every Day
 Today, anyone who is hungry can get a hot meal every day of the week at one of the eight churches in the area that participate in the soup kitchen program: Sunday at 5 P.M. at Church of Christ in Chester, Monday at 5:30 P.M. at First Baptist in Essex, Tuesday at 5 P.M. at St. John's Episcopal in Essex; Wednesday at noon at Grace Episcopal in Old Saybrook and at United Methodist in Clinton; Thursday at 5 P.M. at Our Lady of Sorrows in Essex; Friday at noon at Trinity Lutheran in the Centerbrook section of Essex; Saturday at noon at St. John's Catholic in Old Saybrook.
About 350 meals are served in all during the week. Some people eat every day at one of churches. Some, particularly those without cars, only eat out one day of the week at the nearest participating church.
 
Distributions Made
 Saturday is the big day for the soup kitchen organization. After the meal is served in Old Saybrook at St. John's, bags of food are distributed. At this time of the year, about 200 people arrive each Saturday to get bags of food, Mr. Little said. Demand goes up radically in the heart of the winter.
No one is asked questions about need, Mr. Little said, either at the church meals or when bags of groceries are distributed. The only question is about how big a family is. Bigger families get more bags of food. "The 200 people who come each Saturday for bags of food represent 900 family members," Mr. Little said. "We distribute about $100,000 in food a year now." Forty percent is donated, by residents and local stores, he said. The other 60 percent must be paid for by church revenues.
On any Saturday at noon, the soup kitchen operation continues at the grammar school in back of St. John's Church where three rooms have been used for food storage and for meals for the past two years. The building has been mostly unused but this fall it will reopen as a parochial school. Mr. Little said he had been assured that the soup kitchen operation could stay.
People, mostly in family groups but occasionally by themselves, filter in quietly for lunch. Most have come by car, some sharing rides. Mothers with toddlers join people well into their 80's or more. All are dressed perhaps not stylishly but certainly cleanly. Certain people stand out. One is an older man, impeccably groomed, who looks as if he could be a resident of Fenwick, Old Saybrook's enclave of old money. Two little girls look as if they were dressed for a recital.
The face of the needy in Old Saybrook does not have the face of defeat of a more urban soup kitchen. It would be impossible to separate the volunteers serving food from those getting food and sometimes, indeed, they are both. "Some of the volunteers are also clients," Mr. Little said.
But he is very conscious that some people regard the Saturday meals as a demeaning experience. "Some wait outside and send their kids in for their bags of food," he said. "We try to ease people in, and then they find out that others here are in the same boat."
 
A Social Occasion
 Some seem to regard the Saturday lunch as a social occasion. Two old brothers come each Saturday from a nursing home in Essex, complaining that the food is terrible there. Children play with other children they see each week.
Mr. Little says grace, then the chatter starts. It is more like a church supper than a soup kitchen and a visitor is likely to forget the reason people are there is that they need, really need, the food. It is a quiet drama that unfolds each Saturday. And a few hundred feet away, the cars pass by in a steady stream on Main Street, in another world.

HEADLINE: County in Push to Cut Trash-Collection Need

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

 BODY:
WHILE public and private organizations have advocated recycling in recent years, a campaign this fall will stress waste reduction. Three meetings and conferences will be held to help individuals and businesses reduce the amount of waste they put on the curb for collection.
"There has been a terrific response to recycling and conservation efforts," said James J. Hogan, director of the County Recycling Office. "People are cooperating when they have the opportunity, but we have to move to the next level of effort and that involves an understanding of waste-generation reduction." 
 Simply put, waste-generation reduction means keeping garbage out of the waste stream completely, through a variety of methods, from composting and using durable goods to developing better shopping habits and getting residents' names removed from mailing lists. Other methods include cutting down on the size of facsimile machine cover sheets and using both sides of a piece of paper to write on.
"Waste generation reduction is a difficult concept to grasp," Mr. Hogan said. "When I speak with educated municipal officials, I sometimes observe a misinterpretation of what it is. They think if we expand the recycling program, it is waste reduction, and that is not the case. The example I use is backyard composting. If you put your leaves this fall in a compost heap, you're not putting them at the curb and the collection crew doesn't pick them up. That is waste-generation reduction."
 
Leave Clippings on Lawns
 Between January and July of this year, 31,623 tons of refuse were recycled in Westchester. The total refuse generated for this period was 351,728 tons. The county is trying to comply with the state's goal of 40 percent recycling and 10 percent waste-generation reduction by 1997. The other 50 percent is garbage that must be incinerated or otherwise disposed of.
The problem is that the amount of waste generated is increasing by about 1 percent a year, with 616,058 tons produced in the county last year while 51,361 tons were recycled.
Because 17 to 20 percent of the county's waste consists of organic matter, Mr. Hogan suggested that it can be reduced by leaving grass clippings on lawns and starting small compost piles for leaves and vegetable matter.
Individuals can eliminate potential garbage by getting their names and addresses taken off mailing lists. This can be done by writing to the Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, Post Office Box 9008, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735. More waste can be avoided by donating old household items, furniture and cleaning to charitable organizations.
In addition to individuals, businesses will be targeted in this fall's campaign. The county recycling office has joined with the Westchester County Association, a business group, to form the Business Recycling Organization. This group will hold its first meeting on Oct. 13 at the County Center in White Plains. "The Recycling Organization is going to be an informal network of executives whose job responsibilities affect recycling and waste reduction," said Richard D. Schaab, vice president of the association.
 
Use Smaller Fax Sheets
 "We're trying to get maintenance managers and those in charge of purchasing, recycling and waste disposal to come together on a regular basis to share ideas on how to expand or start recycling and waste generation reduction programs," Mr. Schaab said, adding that he expects the group to meet four times a year.
Companies can cut down on waste by eliminating the 8-by-11-inch transmission sheets used with faxes and replacing them with 4-by-1 1/2-inch sheets. Reports can be put on both sides of a piece of paper, instead of only one. And cafeterias can replace disposable good with durable ones.
Mr. Hogan said: "This is an economic issue for both homes and businesses. Businesses have to look for every advantage in today's competitive market. By using these simple habits, they will save money on both the purchasing and waste-disposal ends."
For information on the business-recycling meeting, call the County Recycling Office at 637-3030.
On Nov. 16, the Cornell Waste Management Institute and Cooperative Extension of Westchester will hold a Train the Trainer workshop for consumers and environmental groups from the seven-county Hudson Valley region. The workshop will train volunteers on waste-prevention strategies and provide educational materials on environmentally sound shopping.
"The environmental choice is the economic choice," said Martha Shortlidge, program leader for home economics at the Cornell Extension Center in White Plains. "People have long thought that it costs more to be environmentally conscious. It is possible now to do both."
While the location of the November conference has not been chosen, those seeking more information can call Ms. Shortlidge at 285-4630.
Ways in which large organizations can save money through waste reduction will be the topic of "A Waste Wise Westchester" conference on Jan. 12 at the County Center in White Plains. In addition to companies, this conference will be for hospitals, schools, municipalities and the general public. The conference is sponsored by the county League of Women Voters, the county recycling office and the Gannett Suburban Newspapers.
As with the Recycling Organization meeting next month, the conference in January will target decision makers of those organizations and try to get them to practice waste reduction.
"We start with the fact that we produce too much garbage," said Carol Gardner, conference coordinator and president of the Hastings-on-Hudson chapter of the League of Women Voters. "But if you tell people that, they yawn. So why will they come to this conference? To save money. How can they do that? By purchasing differently. People think if they have separated their glass and papers they have done enough. But that is not the case."
For information on the January conference, call 478-7559.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Salomon's Hong Kong Hangover

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla 

 BODY:
THE derivatives meltdown of 1994 hasn't been much fun for any of the small investors who got caught in the whirlwind of what should have been solely a big players' game. Just ask the buyers of short-term bond funds who have lined up to sue managements of their "safe" mutual funds.
Better yet, talk to the investors who would never have imagined that their ultra-safe money market funds could fall below $1 a share -- "breaking the buck" in Wall Streetspeak.
But bad as those debacles may have been, few individuals felt the sting of derivatives as badly as those who used brokers in a Hong Kong office of Salomon Brothers Inc. 
 With the guidance of Salomon, customers in San Francisco, Hong Kong and Singapore purchased millions apiece in securities typically reserved for Wall Street's professional investors: inverse floaters, mortgage pass-throughs, and collateralized mortgage obligations.
Different ways to play the housing market, these complex securities rise and fall in conjunction with interest rates. When interest rates rose in February, Salomon's customers faced huge losses without the comfort of an image-conscious fund company that might provide a bailout.
But why did retail investors buy the risky stuff that wound up toppling Wall Street giants in the first place?
For one thing, Salomon told investors that the potentially volatile investments were safe. Marketing material sent to clients said that collateralized mortgage obligations were "very liquid" and that there was no market risk -- a wild claim to make about a rate-sensitive investment.
Today, a half-dozen wealthy Hong Kong investors who bought the pitch are attempting to settle with Salomon after having filed with the National Association of Securities Dealers to arbitrate against the firm. (The investors have withdrawn that claim in the meantime.)
Another four in San Francisco -- including one who borrowed on his credit cards to make the investment -- have filed a separate arbitration complaint. And an attorney for a Singapore investor was readying yet another arbitration complaint against Salomon last week when Salomon contacted the client to suggest settlement talks.
Ray Peffer, the lawyer for the San Francisco investors, estimated that $100 million in mortgage-backed securities may have been sold to retail investors through the Hong Kong office. While not all those investors would have incurred losses, Mr. Peffer questioned whether they were appropriate investments for individuals.
Robert Baker, a spokesman for Salomon, declined comment on the Singapore investor's complaints. "We won't divulge a client's confidential information in order to respond to the claims of a plaintiff's attorney," he said, referring to Jonathan Kord Lagemann, lawyer for the Singapore investor.
The complaints of the Singapore investor are of particular interest because of the timing of the trades. The investor, who requested anonymity through Mr. Lagemann, had purchased $11 million in derivatives on margin in February, and by March, was already being dunned an additional $1.2 million because the securities were under water.
But even as the Singapore investor was awaiting settlement of his trades, a Salomon executive from New York was poring over the books of the troubled Hong Kong office to better understand the firm's liability in dozens of other problem accounts containing derivatives. Mr. Lagemann contends that the executive was thus in a position to have canceled his client's pending trades or warn him about the risk he was taking.
"The Hong Kong problem," as it has become known in the halls of Salomon's New York headquarters, is worrisome enough that it has captured the attention of William Heyman, managing director of the Private Investment Division and a former director of market regulation for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Craig Palmer, a director in Mr. Heyman's department, spent months in Hong Kong, accompanied for part of that period by George Garvey of Munger Tolles & Olsen, law firm for Warren Buffett, a former chairman of Salomon, and Harold Levy, a Salomon lawyer. Mr. Baker declined to make Mr. Heyman available.
Despite their efforts at fence-mending, Salomon is still worried enough about possible repercussions that it is apparently pushing to reduce what is known as "counterparty risk" -- the risk of being stiffed by angry customers who refuse to pay their margin calls.
When the Singapore businessman wanted out of his positions, his Salomon broker suggested that he might get a better price than the one on his monthly statement by going to another brokerage firm. Morgan Stanley, in fact, found a buyer willing to pay 10 percent more than Salomon was valuing the securities. Mr. Baker said that, given the volatile markets of earlier this year, "it is not surprising that there would be significant price variation." But Mr. Lagemann believes Salomon has an incentive to low-ball the value of customers' derivatives so that it can accelerate margin calls and reduce its own financial risk as a lender to its customers.
Then again, it just may be that Salomon is so befuddled by derivatives that it simply can't determine values. In a March 7 form letter to customers, Salomon admitted that "some of the market values appearing on your statement for February 28" failed to properly factor in market declines. By April, another form letter warned clients that March's monthly statements were a "best assessment" of prices, and that customers should regard prices as "approximate."
Indeed, not even Mr. Palmer could get it right when he shipped off a two-page letter to the Singapore businessman on April 15, noting that "based on market prices at this writing, further posting of $896,000 is necessary." A week later, Mr. Palmer would be signing a corrective letter lowering the earlier values and demanding $1.069 million from the investor. It's tough to nail down a price when a stable, liquid investment neglects to act as the sales literature dictates.

HEADLINE: How G.E. Plays for Keeps in Diamonds

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
A LEISURELY dinner in Brussels two years ago might seem harmless enough. But next month in a courtroom in Columbus, Ohio, the Federal Government will argue that what happened there was a crucial act in an elaborate international conspiracy in violation of American antitrust laws.
The meal in question took place one January evening in 1992, when Peter Frenz, the General Electric Company's industrial diamond sales manager for Europe, sat down with Phillipe Liotier, a Belgian business executive, at the Royal Windsor Hotel. 
 Mr. Liotier worked for Diamant Boart, a company that regularly bought industrial diamonds from G.E. A routine meeting with valued customer? Perhaps, but what the Justice Department's investigators found intriguing was who owned Diamant Boart and what transpired at the dinner and afterward.
The Belgian company was owned in part by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African conglomerate best known for dominating the market for the gem diamonds found in rings, necklaces and other jewelry. But De Beers is also G.E.'s largest competitor in industrial diamonds -- the rougher, gravelly stones, which are now mainly synthetic and used in everything from oil-well drill bits to high-precision cutting tools for manufacturing.
During the meal, Mr. Liotier provided Mr. Frenz with a list of upcoming De Beers price increases for industrial diamonds. The G.E. sales manager scribbled them onto a piece of hotel stationery and faxed them to the Ohio headquarters of G.E.'s diamond business.
After receiving the fax and other information about its competitor, G.E. raised its diamond prices in concert with De Beers. Since the two companies dominate the business, the prices for industrial diamonds went up worldwide.
To the Justice Department, the Brussels episode is a damning piece of evidence. To G.E., it is nothing of the kind. Their dispute will soon move to the Columbus courtroom and a trial that is expected to be one of the most far-reaching and bitterly contested criminal prosecutions in the annals of antitrust. In court, the two sides will be represented by expert trial lawyers. Yet each camp is headed by well-known personalities, one a Washington activist and the other one of corporate America's leading executives.
Anne K. Bingaman, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, has revived that unit since the start of the Clinton Administration -- a sharp break from the more laissez-faire stance taken during the Reagan-Bush years.
Her high-profile pursuit of the Microsoft Corporation ended recently with a settlement that seemed a draw at best. The software giant agreed to change some practices the Government claimed were unfair, but analysts say the settlement really will not dent Microsoft's dominance of the market for personal computer operating software.
John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, is one of the most respected managers in America. Recently, however, he has been stung by questions raised about his managerial acumen because of a trading scandal at the company's Wall Street subsidiary, Kidder, Peabody.
Earlier this year, Mr. Welch met with Ms. Bingaman in Washington. He tried to convince her that the Government had no case. She offered a settlement. Both left dissatisfied. So now the case goes to trial.
"The antitrust division will not tolerate anticompetitive acts by two firms who dominate their worldwide markets, or sophisticated schemes that are used to fix prices and disguise criminal activity," Ms. Bingaman said in announcing the indictment of the two companies.
For his part, Mr. Welch believes his company has been unfairly targeted. In an internal memo, he denounced the indictment as "outrageous," and he criticized it again in a recent interview.
"No one who has looked at it, other than them, thinks it has any element of criminality," Mr. Welch said in angry tones. "Look, we could have settled this case. When we have an issue, we go down and we settle up. We believe we are so right on this one."
THE antitrust case is also focusing attention on the once-quiet, profitable world of industrial diamonds -- an unglamorous but vital product necessary for doing things that range from drilling for oil to making jet fighters. For General Electric and De Beers, the business has generated a steady stream of cash, with high margins and no real competitors. At G.E., while industrial diamonds account for only a fraction of the $60 billion in annual revenues, they have been a consistent source of profits -- $167 million in the years from 1986 to 1989 alone, for example.
But in the last few years, competitors have sprung up in Germany, Japan and South Korea as others have figured out how to manufacture diamonds. So General Electric and De Beers have watched their absolute dominance gradually erode, with their market share slipping from 90 percent in 1991 to about 80 percent.
 
Aggressive Competitor Or Beyond the Pale?
 To some familiar with G.E.'s diamond operation, the question is just how far the company, with its intolerance for weak businesses, stress on hitting the numbers and Mr. Welch's absolute desire to win, has been willing to go to defend its once-secure franchise. Has G.E. simply been an aggressive competitor or did it go too far?
It has certainly been aggressive in guarding its diamond business. In a recent campaign against a foreign company suspected of using stolen G.E. technology, for example, the company began what its general counsel described as "trench warfare."
G.E. enlisted the services of everyone from private detectives who sifted through the trash of a former G.E. scientist to top American trade officials, and even former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Although wide competition is new to industrial diamonds, controversy is not. During World War II, the Justice Department accused De Beers of refusing to sell the American Government enough natural diamonds for war-time weapons production, where they were used in precision grinding and cutting tools. The department also said De Beers overcharged the Government for the diamonds it did sell.
In 1945, the Justice Department filed an antitrust case against De Beers, charging the cartel with restricting distribution and fixing prices of diamonds. A judge threw out the case, concluding the United States lacked jurisdiction because De Beers conducted its business outside this country.
After the war, scientists in several countries raced to develop a way to produce man-made diamonds. Working in strict secrecy, G.E. engineers in a laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., won the contest in 1954. Its first synthetic stones were small and discolored, too rough for the jewelry business, but they were true diamonds and their unparalleled hardness made them perfect for industrial uses.
Still smarting from the wartime shortage and concerned about Soviet weapons advances, the Eisenhower Administration clamped a lid on the technical details until 1959, when General Electric was finally allowed to file for a patent.
But the impact of the discovery was immediate at the offices of De Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African cartel that controlled every aspect of the world diamond trade. Alarmed at the threat to its monopoly, De Beers embarked on a crash program to match G.E. But the company was unable to duplicate the American alchemy.
By the early 1960's, however, De Beers was supplementing its natural diamonds with manufactured versions, too. G.E. sued De Beers for patent infringement. De Beers settled the suit by paying $8 million and royalties to license the G.E. technology. The two companies then proceeded to divide the world market into a duopoly that stood for three decades.
DE BEERS's lurking fear was that G.E. would turn its efforts to producing gem-quality diamonds, which could devastate the $4 billion-a-year gem business that generated the vast bulk of the cartel's profits.
"Among people in the diamond business, the feeling has always been that De Beers made an arrangement where G.E. would not produce gem diamonds and De Beers would not undercut G.E. in industrial diamonds," said Edward Jay Epstein, author of "The Rise and Fall of Diamonds," a book about De Beers.
G.E. and De Beers executives say there was no such agreement. After years of experimenting, the company determined that producing gem-quality diamonds was not economical, said Joyce Hergenhan, a G.E. spokeswoman.
Since the 1960's, synthetic diamonds have replaced mined diamonds for most industrial uses. Production of diamonds now outstrips mining of diamonds three to one. But gem-quality manufactured diamonds remain only an unfulfilled promise.
In the early 1970's, De Beers again attracted the attention of the Justice Department. Investigators suspected the South Africans were trying to gain control of American distributors for industrial diamonds. But the cartel again proved to be outside the reach of the Justice Department.
"We hired a solicitor to serve some papers on De Beers in South Africa and the company representative tore them up," said Joel Davidow, a Washington attorney who was a senior Justice Department lawyer at the time.
G.E. makes diamonds in Worthington, Ohio, in a single-story building surrounded by an eight-foot fence. Employees must sign confidentiality agreements not to disclose the technology. But in the summer of 1989, G.E. suspected a security breach.
The resulting drama opened on May 25. Joe Elliott, a G.E. technician, was watching television at home when his telephone rang about 9 P.M. A caller, who identified himself as Larry King, wanted to hire Mr. Elliott to oversee diamond production for an unnamed foreign manufacturer. He offered $50,000 a year and $50,000 in bonuses.
 
Bringing In The Private Detectives
 Suspicious the deal was too sweet to be legitimate, Mr. Elliott alerted his superiors. They advised him to play along to discover the name of the company, according to later court testimony, and they sought help from the Fairfax Group, a corporate investigations firm.
Under a scenario devised by Fairfax, Mr. Elliott recorded his phone calls and set up a meeting to discuss the job at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Manhattan. A private detective would accompany Mr. Elliott, posing as his lawyer and carrying a tape recorder concealed in a briefcase.
Part of the mystery was solved before the meeting. From the return address on an employment contract mailed to Mr. Elliott, the detectives discovered that Mr. King was Chien-Min Sung, the manager of G.E.'s diamond operations from 1977 until he resigned in 1984.
In mid-June, Mr. Elliott and the detective arrived at the hotel expecting to find Mr. Sung. Instead they met the president of a subsidiary of the Iljin Corporation, a major Korean manufacturing conglomerate. After some discussion, Mr. Elliott agreed to visit Korea to examine Iljin's plant before deciding on the job, although he never went.
G.E. now suspected Mr. Sung had sold its technology to Iljin. The trick was proving it. For seven weeks, private detectives sifted through trash bags left outside Mr. Sung's home in a Boston suburb. Among the garbage were documents shredded methodically into tiny strips. When painstakingly reassembled, the papers proved to be G.E. technical plans for manufacturing diamonds, according to court testimony.
G.E. lawyers had a secret meeting with a Federal judge and persuaded him to take a highly unusual step. Convinced by G.E. that any warning might cause Mr. Sung to flee, the judge approved a search warrant that allowed the company to search its former employee's home.
At 9 A.M. on Sept. 18, 1989, about 10 lawyers and private detectives arrived at the home. Mrs. Sung, who spoke little English, was the only person there. For six hours, she watched as virtually every scrap of paper was boxed up and carted off. Around noon, the searchers paused to eat lunch at her dining room table.
G.E. sued Iljin and Mr. Sung for return of its technology. It also turned over the evidence to the United States Attorney's office in Boston, leading to Mr. Sung's quick indictment for selling G.E. trade secrets to Iljin for $1 million.
William D. Crowe, Mr. Sung's attorney, argued that G.E.'s actions were intended solely to eliminate a competitor to the monopoly it shared with De Beers. But in the end, Mr. Sung struck a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to one count. The Government recommended leniency, and Mr. Sung was given six months home detention.
Iljin fought the suit, arguing that it had developed much of its own technology and denying knowing Mr. Sung's plans were stolen.
G.E. responded with a campaign to pressure Iljin out of the business, an effort outlined in internal G.E. documents. A G.E. lawyer warned in one memo that Iljin had captured three big G.E. customers, with $100,000 a month in combined sales.
Even if G.E. won in court, the lawyer wrote, it faced difficulty enforcing a verdict in much of the world, where American intellectual property laws are not recognized.
Recognizing that something more was needed, G.E. took its case to Washington. The company persuaded the two top American trade officials at the time, United States Trade Representative Carla Hills and Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, to argue its case in talks with Korea. G.E. also brought in Henry Kissinger, a consultant to the company, to warn Korean officials that they faced retaliation unless Iljin returned the technology.
"He should sound very threatening" about how the use of stolen information would threaten Korea's and Iljin's relations with the United States and G.E., Benjamin W. Heineman Jr., the G.E. general counsel, wrote in a memo.
A year ago, the civil suit went to trial in Boston. Iljin lawyer Michael B. Keating accused G.E. of trying to wipe out a competitor and G.E. lawyers countered that Iljin should have known the technology was stolen. The jury agreed with G.E., and last January the judge banned Iljin from making diamonds for seven years as punishment. Enforcing the ban remained problematic and, after Iljin filed an appeal, the companies reached a settlement in which Iljin will pay a licensing fee to G.E. and continue producing diamonds.
 
Origins of a Criminal Investigation
 It was Edward J. Russell, once one of G.E.'s 127 corporate vice presidents worldwide and the head of its diamond division, who helped to put General Electric at the opposite end of the table from the Government.
After record profits in the late 1980's under Mr. Russell, division earnings flagged in 1990 and 1991. In late 1991, Mr. Russell was fired on orders from Mr. Welch.
Mr. Russell responded by filing a lawsuit against the company claiming he was dismissed for complaining about price fixing by G.E. and De Beers. The F.B.I. and Justice Department opened an investigation in Columbus, near the G.E. plant.
THOUSANDS of G.E. documents were subpoenaed, yet the inquiry was hampered because many witnesses and records were in Europe.
But the F.B.I. was not deterred. In the spring of 1993, agents learned that an official of a De Beers affiliate was attending the Master's golf tournament in Georgia as a G.E. guest. After the tournament, the executive was taken into custody, flown to Columbus and put before the grand jury.
In early February of 1994, the Justice Department was about to indict G.E. and Mr. Welch went to Washington to argue his case before Ms. Bingaman. He said G.E. and De Beers were fierce competitors and he described Mr. Russell as a disgruntled executive fired for poor performance.
Mr. Welch said later that he rejected a plea bargain offer and he left the meeting believing G.E. would be indicted -- as it was a few days later.
Mr. Welch had better luck with Mr. Russell. On the eve of the indictment, the two men met in Cincinnati with their lawyers. Settlement talks had been under way since January. Finally Mr. Russell agreed to dismiss his suit and sign an affidavit swearing he had no "personal knowledge" that G.E. had fixed prices or broken any other law. His lawyer signed a similar statement.
 
A Final Bid To Stop Indictment
 Still hoping to stop the indictment, G.E. faxed the surprise Russell statement to the Justice Department that night. By this time, however, the inquiry had gone beyond the initial allegations and the Government felt its evidence was strong enough to support criminal charges.
G.E. and De Beers Centenary A. G., a De Beers affiliate in Switzerland, were indicted on Feb. 17, along with Mr. Frenz, the G.E. sales manager, and Mr. Liotier, who has since left Diamant Boart. The basic allegation was that G.E. and De Beers, through Mr. Frenz and Mr. Liotier, swapped information in 1991 and 1992 in a scheme to coordinate price increases. One of the central acts in the alleged conspiracy was the January 1992 dinner the two men had in Brussels.
THE Government and G.E. differ sharply over the role played by Mr. Liotier. The Government claims that he was exchanging the information on behalf of De Beers, with Diamant Boart as a convenient subterfuge. But G.E. argues that Mr. Liotier was operating solely as an executive of Diamant Boart and that there was no agreement with De Beers to fix prices.
"All the contacts we had with Liotier were contacts with him as our customer, Diamant Boart," said Dan K. Webb, a former United States Attorney in Chicago, who represents G.E. "We never believed that Diamant Boart was acting for De Beers. And if Liotier is not an agent of De Beers, there is no crime here."
De Beers also has denied wrongdoing, but it will not contest the charges in court. "We are not involved in the mainstream of American business in any sense at all, so we won't be appearing in court in Ohio," Brian Cullingworth, an official with De Beers in Johannesburg, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Frenz, a German, and Mr. Liotier, who is French, are not expected to appear in court. Mr. Frenz was questioned for six days in London last July by attorneys for both sides and his videotaped testimony will be played. His lawyer, Carl S. Rauh, said Mr. Frenz denied any wrongdoing. Attempts to reach Mr. Liotier and his lawyer were unsuccessful.
While the other defendants will be absent, General Electric will be there. Said Mr. Welch, "We want to go all the way with this one."

THE ECONOMY
 
The Week's Scorecard: No Inflation, 2; Inflation, 1; Baseball, 0
This gets dizzying. Just a week ago, the inflation cops were blowing their whistles again after an unexpected jump in producer prices. But then came last week's report that consumer prices were nice and tame, and everyone quickly said, "Never mind." And after a second batch of data reinforced the low-inflation script -- a report by a regional Federal Reserve Bank, a drop in jobless claims, a rise in business inventories -- the stock market gleefully took off, with the Dow industrials hitting their highest level since this whole merry-go-round started with that first Federal Reserve rate increase on Feb. 3. It was a short party, though, because the next day came word of a sharp rise in industrial production, the inflation warnings were trotted out again, and the Dow slumped. But this week, who knows? Perhaps these reports should be allowed to age so people can sip them a little more soberly. 

Immigrants: Now, Some Facts
The reason Cuba and Haiti get so much attention is simple: we have a morbid fear of having our economy eroded by a flood of immigrants. But an Urban Institute study out last week presumes to replace hysteria with facts. For one thing, in the seven states with the most illegal immigrants, those immigrants pay $1.9 billion in state and local taxes. True, they cost states even more, for education and the like, but those taxes are often conveniently forgotten when states wail for Federal relief. Another note: immigrants overall, legal and otherwise, are a plus for the economy.
 
And the Earth Still Spins
This will be interesting. Some diehard baseball fans, twitching in their sweaty recliners in the agonies of withdrawal, surely predicted civilization's fiery end if -- yes, we've got to say it -- there was no World Series. So now we'll see, now that team owners have spoken the unspeakable -- that for the first time since 1904, you'll be able to ride an elevator at World Series time without hearing some grim-faced soul say "What a play!" or "They blew it!" Did baseball itself blow it? Yes, everyone lost millions -- the clubs, the players, the baseball-card makers, the hot dog vendors. But what if fans kick the habit and don't show up in the spring? Back to the sandlot.
 
Banking Enters the Big Mac Age
It had to happen. You can buy identical Big Macs anywhere in the country -- and much of the world, for that matter. In USA Today, the nation's news is all one, and state lines exist only as adornments on the weather map. But banking got left behind somehow, stuck in horse-and-buggy-and-green-eyeshade days, with state lines remaining barriers to many banking operations. Last week, though, the Senate passed a bill allowing banks to operate branches in any state. President Clinton called it a "historic step -- one that has been delayed for much too long." Smaller banks that could be hurt by the bill got one concession: for now, big banks must buy a bank in a state before launching an invasion.
 
DRIVERS WALK! (Just Kidding.)
On Sept. 8, if the averages held, more than 100 people were killed in auto accidents nationwide. They got no coverage in the national press. If others, in reaction to this appalling carnage, refused to drive the following day, this too got no coverage. That same day, 132 people were killed in a USAir crash near Pittsburgh; this got a lot of national press. And last week, throughout the land, fears of flying gushed to the surface: trips were canceled, long drives replaced flights, travelers avoided Pittsburgh altogether. How to explain it? That's a tough one.
 
He Could Sue (If He Had Cash)
Suppose you thought someone had swindled you out of millions, got caught and then asked you to advance cash for his legal bills. That's the problem Kidder, Peabody faces with Joseph Jett, a bond trader accused of being adept at pulling millions of phony rabbits out of hats. The trouble is, Kidder has a bylaw obligating it to pay those bills. And it is paying bills for two executives who were found, in its own inquiry, to have been grossly negligent for not keeping tabs on Mr. Jett. It appeared last week, though, that Kidder would close its checkbook to Mr. Jett -- perhaps, some said, to try to starve Mr. Jett out and keep him from dragging Kidder through any more legal mud. But there is that bylaw.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Britain Tries a U.S. Tactic
Europe has been lagging behind the United States in bouncing in and out of recession, but it still seems to be moving through the same cycles. Last week -- in a move reminiscent of the Federal Reserve's actions early this year -- Britain raised a key interest rate for the first time since 1989, following similar moves in Italy and Sweden. And the reason rang a loud bell: to squash inflation without hindering growth. But here's where Europe diverges from America's pattern: unemployment remains near record levels.
 
Bayer Goes Home
First the Berlin wall, now Bayer aspirin: things are gradually reverting to old ways. It was a Bayer chemist who developed aspirin in 1897, but during World War I the United States confiscated Bayer's American aspirin business, later selling it to Sterling for $5.3 million. For years afterward, Bayer struggled to get it back, and last week it finally did so, by a circuitous route: SmithKline bought Sterling's over-the-counter drug lines from Kodak, but then sold the Bayer business to its original owner for $1 billion. The rain on this homecoming parade, though, is that Bayer is regaining its birthright at a time when aspirin has been shoved to a corner of the shelf by Tylenol, Advil and their no-name cousins.
 
COMPANIES
 
Suddenly, Borden's Popular
Why would anyone want Borden, which has done so badly in recent years? That's what Wall Street asked itself last week when Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts made a $2 billion deal to buy it. But for Kohlberg, Kravis, the reason soon became clear: as part of the complex deal, it will dump much of its stake in RJR Nabisco. But then, in another surprise, came talk of a new bidder: Paul Kazarian. Mr. Kazarian, though, may have trouble getting financing, because even though he's a turnaround whiz, he's also been called irrational and erratic -- reportedly the reason he was ousted as head of Sunbeam-Oster last year.
 
Stepping Off the Treadmill
It shouldn't be called strange, said Stephen Friedman, that "I don't want to spend half of my day on the telephone and the other half on an airplane." But Wall Street doesn't get it when someone fairly young, who's on top of the game, bails out. So there was surprise last week when Mr. Friedman, at the tender age of 56, descended from a Wall Street pinnacle, as head of Goldman Sachs. There were inevitable murmurs that he was leaving because profits were plunging. But there was no clear reason not to accept what Mr. Friedman said, that the job was "more than a little tiring."
 
Time Inc. Opens the Club Doors
In the beginning there was Henry Luce, who started Time magazine in 1923 and was its guiding force for decades. Only three other people have run Time Inc.'s magazines, all of them insiders. But today's corporate realities often make such inbreeding obsolete -- even the company itself has melded personalities with a stranger, becoming Time Warner. So last week Time Inc. snapped that insider tradition by naming Norman Pearlstine, former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, as editor in chief. But does this break with the past, an open secret for weeks now, portend basic changes at Time? No, says Mr. Pearlstine, "magazines as we know them" will remain Time's core.
 
Nobody Pushes United Around
After that skinny kid called Southwest Airlines charged into the playground and stole everyone's marbles, the big guys just stood there gaping. No more. One of the big guys, United, has rolled up its sleeves and challenged the kid to a one-on-one. In California -- a corridor almost twice as busy as Washington-Boston -- United is taking on Southwest at its own game: low fares, fast boarding, keep the planes moving. One United innovation: board window seats first, keep people moving. And one frill Southwest lacks: reserved seats. Now, the sparks should fly -- and air travel may never be the same.

Enough, Already!

BYLINE: By JILL EISENSTADT; Jill Eisenstadt wrote "From Rockaway" and "Kiss Out," two novels set in the boroughs outside Manhattan.

 BODY:
SHE'S the gum crackin', chain-smokin' Bay Ridge/Woodside/Richmond/Woodlawn hairdresser/secretary who tells it like it is and don't take no crap from no one. Only her best friend has bigger breasts and hoop earrings, a thicker accent and make-up job. Only her Pops gets to call her his "little girl" and slap her can when she serves his eats. Her mother makes a good sauce, the best, and crosses herself frequently. Her boyfriend? Well, all's he ever wants is to hang out with his loser buddies: flashy mobsters, unemployed home boys or blue-collar toughs.
Sure, she loves him but, ya know, like she's got dreams as symbolized by The Bridge, which looms in the near distance, majestically back lit. It's her ticket outta this lousy neighborhood, her chance to finally become someone. Could it be that underneath her helmet of hair lies a C.E.O.'s brain with the potential for appreciating literature and painting? Or will she just win Lotto and get to shop at Saks? It's the genuine article, The Outerborough Chick. Coming soon to a theater near you! 
 Wait a minute, I think I've seen that movie. Annabella Sciorra? Rosie Perez? She calls off the wedding and dates the college professor? Or is it that other one, where she gets pregnant and the two possible dads smash up the pizzeria? I'm confused. I'm amazed. I'm amused by the way Hollywood portrays us New York City females if we happen to live outside Manhattan.
 
1. WE'RE COMIC
 Whaddya need speech class for, ya tawk fine. -- Cindy to Tess in "Working Girl"
Yes, many of us come from large, loud ethnic families and have learned to squawk rapidly to be heard. But this accent has been so played up that whenever I tell anyone I'm from Brooklyn and Queens, they say, "But you don't have that funny accent," or more interestingly, "But you're not funny."
Even if I did have "that funny accent" (which, for the record, differs from borough to borough) would it necessarily follow that I was as funny as "Funny Girl" and "Arthur" would suggest? Are we, as a group, really funnier than women from other places? I don't think so. I've seen only two truly sorrowful female outerborough characters -- Annette in "Saturday Night Fever" and Vicky in "Raging Bull" -- and a third who actually manages to rise or sink beyond sadness to the level of tragic. Then again, this third, Tralala, the gang-raped prostitute in "Last Exit to Brooklyn," was created by a novelist, Hubert Selby. He'd never buy the myth that . . .
 
2. WE'RE ALL ITALIAN
 Out of the roughly six million people who live in the boroughs, a scant 10 percent have their roots back in the boot. But you'd certainly get a different impression after seeing "Mr. Wonderful," "Angie," "Moonstruck," "Raging Bull," "29th Street," "Cookie," "Married to the Mob," "Wise Guys," "Queens Logic," "True Love," "My Cousin Vinny," "The Wanderers" and "Mac" to name a few. Maybe what we have is a disproportionate number of Italian-American directors or screen writers. Certainly, what we have is an audience that never tires of Mafia hit men and large gaudy weddings. Of course, there's Woody Allen, but usually only mothers dwell in his cinematic outerboroughs. (Even when she's a disembodied head in the sky above Manhattan, we know she's really back in Midwood). Of course, there's Spike Lee, but even he highlights Italians in films like "Do the Right Thing" and "Jungle Fever." And I'm not sure he's entirely innocent when it comes to perpetuating the idea that . . .
 
3. WE'RE CRUDE
 To his credit, Spike Lee questions and plays with this stereotype. The women in "She's Gotta Have It" neither speak in shrieks nor dress clownishly. There's a musician, an artist, even, gasp, a lesbian. The film's protagonist, Nola, is sleeping with three men. But instead of being branded a slut, she's celebrated as liberated. Instead of worrying about her reputation (another outerborough theme), she's proud to thoughtlessly pursue sex. In short, she's a man in a woman's body, which is to my mind just another way (albeit an updated and roundabout one) of portraying the outerborough chick as crude, as macho.
This is not to say coarse, tacky outerborough chicks don't exist. Growing up in Rockaway our favorite sport was ridiculing the Canarsie girls who'd sashay down to the beach in six-inch heels, bikinis and belly chains. We called them "hitters" (for hitting on our boyfriends, I guess). Now they're more commonly labeled The Bridge and Tunnel Crowd. But don't forget, three of those bridges and tunnels lead to Jersey. Visibility a majority does not make. Some of us might even take issue with the notion that . . .
 
4. WE'RE BLUE COLLAR
 I know, I know, this is only movieland. Viewers expect their New York City professionals to live in fabulous uptown doorman buildings. Their writers in picturesque Greenwich Village squalor. It doesn't matter if all the painters actually live in Greenpoint, the Wall Streeters in Brooklyn Heights, the writers in Park Slope, the lawyers in Forest Hills. We're comforted by the gossipy manicurist, entertained by the foul-mouthed, hard-luck waitress;it's what we're used to. Why complicate a simple Mafia movie by giving the wife an interior life or, God forbid, career aspirations? If by chance, one of our ilk should have a glimmer of ambition, class or talent it's artistically superior if . . .
 
5. WE'RE ASPIRING TO LIVE IN MANHATTAN
 You have no idea how it changes right over there across the river. It's different. It's beautiful. People are beautiful. Offices are beautiful. Lunch hours are beautiful, too. -- Stephanie in "Saturday Night Fever"
 In fact, I (and most of my friends out here) had similar delusions. But after 5 or 10 years of cramped, expensive apartments, we came to our senses and retreated to a saner, greener, more spacious existence. Hopefully, it won't prove true that . . .
 
6. WE'RE ABUSED AND ABUSIVE AND IT SHOWS
 They looked beat up. And the stuff they wore was thrown together and cheap, a lot of pantsuits and double knits. And they talked about how rotten their kids were and about beating them with broom handles and leather belts but that the kids still wouldn't listen. -- Karen in "Goodfellas."
I have no idea how accurate this image is but it's certainly been around a long time. After all, what's a Mafia movie without at least one wife-battering scene? Would we still laugh with Ralph Kramden if he didn't threaten to send Alice to the moon? Early in "Raging Bull," Jake La Motta's first wife is browbeaten for cooking the steak wrong. In"Saturday Night Fever," Annette is gang raped for worshiping the disco king. In "Goodfellas," Karen gets a lamp thrown at her for confronting her husband's infidelities. True, we put up a fight but . . .
 
7. WE'RE NEVER HEROINES
 "Working Girl" is the one of the few exceptions -- if you consider lying your way to the top noble behavior. Otherwise, you have to go way back to that old classic, "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."
But it's worth it, if only for a glimpse of where our image originated. For like any cliche it has its basis in the truth.
Kate, the tactless, uneducated wife of a charming but unstable alcoholic makes no apologies -- "My kids are gonna be somebody if I gotta turn into granite rock to make 'em." Her hardness may take its toll -- "Funny, sometime, you forget you are a woman" -- but it also insures the family's financial survival just as her sister, Sissy, though tacky and crude, uplifts it through humor. The Tree is really no different than The Bridge, a symbol for her daughter, Francie, of a brighter, more artistic future. But like all the outerborough chicks who succeed her, she's smart enough to know that the first requirement for making it out of the neighborhood is to tell it like it is and take no crap from no one.

HEADLINE: Swissair Plies the Unfriendly Skies of United Europe

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ZURICH

 BODY:
For Swissair, based in this trim city in the heart of Europe, the biggest problem these days seems to be how to become a European airline. And its European dilemma helps explain why, despite a stellar reputation for punctuality, service and tasteful cuisine, Swissair is losing money in its airline business.
Even though its flights are often filled, Swissair had a pretax loss of about $50 million during the first half of this year on its air service, analysts estimate. Only Swissair's profitable hotels and catering divisions enable the company as a whole to remain profitable. Last year, it reported earnings of $46 million on operating revenues of $4.9 billion. 
 Like many airlines trying to prosper in today's increasingly competitive skies, Swissair has embarked on a cost-cutting program. Jobs are being cut, perhaps as many as 4,000 of a total payroll of 25,000 workers. Services like food and aircraft cleaning are being contracted out. The goal is to bolster productivity by trimming labor costs, which now amount to 36 percent of revenues, estimates Susanne Borer, an analyst at Bank J. Vontobel & Company in Zurich. By contrast, industry analysts say airlines with a handle on labor costs are in the 25 to 30 percent range.
Yet streamlining operations may do little good in the long run unless Swissair can find a solution to its biggest challenge: gaining a secure niche in the rapidly-changing European market. The Swiss voters certainly haven't helped their flagship airline. Last December, they decided by a margin of 51 to 49 percent to reject membership in the 11-nation European Union. So Swissair risks being left on the sidelines in a revolution that is unfolding among the airlines within the European Union.
The European upheaval is a deregulation of air travel similar to the overhaul that began in the United States in the 1980's. It is an evolution that will steadily lift barriers until Jan. 1, 1997, the target date for fully open skies in the European markets. It means carriers can fly into more markets, more often and offer lower ticket prices to lure travelers.
Already, airlines from the European Union's 11 countries are moving into markets once banned to them. British Airways, Europe's most profitable airline, has established subsidiaries in France and Germany, and announced direct flights from Rome to Paris.
Last month Germany's Lufthansa announced a package of cut-rate one-way fares, some as low as $65, to match those offered by British Air on flights between German cities. Italy's Alitalia has forged a link with British Midland, in what appears to be a bid to bring the battle to British turf.
Another byproduct of the deregulation has been to shift the ownership of many European carriers from governments to private hands. With privatization has come a new breed of more aggressive business managers.
Britain led the way in the 1980's, selling shares in British Airways. This fall, Lufthansa will raise fresh capital on the stock market in the first of several transactions aimed at reducing the German Government stake to a minority one by the end of this year. Alitalia and Air France are next in line for privatization.
For a carrier like Swissair, the European Union's deregulation is a twin threat. It means that the Swiss airline is not only facing a more vigorous group of competitors, but also that it cannot compete on an equal footing. The new opportunities from opening the skies are available only to the 11 members of the European Union club. Barriers are not so much being dismantled as moved, from national borders to the boundaries of the European Union.
And the European Union states tend to act as one when keeping carriers from nonmember nations out, but not when letting other carriers in. This means that Switzerland must negotiate air traffic agreements with individual governments, all of them fiercely protective of their skies, in addition to reaching an accord with the Union. The least competitive airlines have been particularly effective in lobbying the European Union in Brussels to retain extra barriers against outsiders.
"The European Union has taken a step forward, and today restrictions are becoming the exception," said Paul Maximilian Muller, an executive vice president at Swissair. "But the weaker carriers have a tendency to request as many exceptions as possible."
There are also real doubts about how serious Brussels is about fostering free-market competition in the skies. National emotions, as well as economics, are involved. Will national governments allow the role of national carriers to be scaled back, as competition sorts winners from losers? Will they let one or two airlines fold?
"If you take an American airline, its role is to produce a profit for shareholders by carrying passengers," said Keith McMullan, the director of Avmark, a London-based airline consulting company. "In Europe, it's a combination of things, often linked to history."
The crunch confronting Europe's weaker carriers is illustrated by Alitalia, whose six straight years of losses, coupled with a growing net debt now set at about $1.2 billion, have pushed the airline to the brink of bankruptcy. Renato Riverso, a 60-year-old former I.B.M. executive who was installed by the Government in February to turn Alitalia around, says the airline is "structurally organized to produce losses."
Alitalia is not alone. Over the last nine months, the European Union has approved government aid totaling $7.4 billion to state-run carriers, including Portugal's TAP, Olympic in Greece, and Ireland's Aer Lingus. The biggest chunk, however, $3.7 billion, went to Air France, the ailing French airline that went into 1994 with $6.2 billion of debt, having failed to turn a profit since 1992.
Government subsidies to ease the adjustment to harsh competition are a luxury not available to Swissair, which is privately owned.
TO succeed in the long run, Swissair must gain greater access to markets in Europe. Even its strategic alliances with Delta in the United States and Singapore Airlines for Asian routes depend on Swissair having a strong European base. For Swissair to remain an attractive partner, it must be able to deliver markets in Europe.
"We're convinced that the future belongs to efficient carriers that can avail themselves of sufficient market influence," explained Mr. Muller of Swissair. "We're too small here in Switzerland. After all, even Milan belongs to Italy."
But efforts to extend its reach in Europe, much beyond the Alps, have so far faltered on national interests.
Last year, a project called Alcazar intended to link Swissair with three other European carriers -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System -- collapsed after national governments failed to agree on a headquarters site and on the apportionment of the job cuts that would have made the merger pay off.
This year, during the summer, Swissair shares were buoyed by the news that the airline was negotiating with Sabena to acquire a 49.5 percent minority stake in the Belgian national airline by buying a 37.5 percent stake now held by Air France, plus 12 percent now in the hands of several Belgian financial companies. Sabena is now 62 percent Government-controlled.
Yet with Air France in the midst of a major overhaul, discussions to disentangle the various holdings are stalled, Mr. Muller said. In the meantime, Swissair is talking with other airlines, including Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, Olympic in Greece, in an effort to enhance its position in Europe.
"But at the moment there are no negotiations," Mr. Muller said. "There are a series of problems of a European nature to resolve."

HEADLINE: Inspiration, Frustration, You're in Business!

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
INSIDE a rumbling, clanking factory in a rundown quarter of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the air is fragrant with peanut oil as Dana Sinkler runs through the creation of a typical Terra Chip. In the hushed refrigeration room, crates of earth-dusted parsnips and well-traveled taro roots await their trip to the slicer. Once sliced, they are bathed in boiling fat, tossed about the salting and seasoning division, and sent through a series of mixing and measuring points before being sealed inside colorful foil bags that will be trucked as far away as California or as nearby as Balducci's to satisfy the public's craving for non-potato chips -- a market that Mr. Sinkler and his partner, Alex Dzieduszycki, seem to have created with their own hands.
This quick walk down the line is about as close as the proud but fearful partners will let an outsider get to the production cycle of the Terra Chip itself (trade secrets, hypercompetitive market and all that). But they are eager to talk in detail about the development of the Terra Chip business, and about their journey through the tangle of inspiration and frustration that New York bestows on companies that come to life here. 
 "It's been the best education in business," is the way Mr. Dzieduszycki puts it.
Four years into that education, theirs is the somewhat accidental success story of a product that just cruised into a nice little marketing niche: Thanks to the public preoccupation with things healthy, and the easy association of what's healthy and what's "natural," these deep-fried, hardly low-calorie root-vegetable slices (which New Yorkers frequently mispronounce as "Taro Chips" or even "Terra Cotta") have become widely perceived, and emulated by several competitors, as junk-food alternatives that are good for you.
The creators started out simply, two men with a mandoline, seeking to distinguish themselves in the Darwinian world of fancy-food catering. Now they lead a $10 million company with 45 workers, turning out 5,000 to 10,000 pounds of chips a day that are sold in six-ounce portions for a lofty $3.99 (recommended retail). And they envision a nation -- even an entire planet -- in which every supermarket has a vegetable-chip section, dominated by theirs, in the snack food aisle.
Along the way, they have been alternately propelled and pummeled by the city, an erratic third party that has acted as a generator and disseminator and threatened at times to turn into their terminator.
To be sure, this still-fledgling entry in the big-time snack-food industry would not exist without New York. The city's dense mix of rich and poor, ethnic and mainstream, sophisticated and mundane, brought the company's creators together, furnished the initial market for their product and helped mold an image that has made it a success far beyond the five boroughs. At the same time, though, the city drove the owners up the wall from time to time and now looms as a potential threat to their continued operations here.
Just how many small businesses start up here each year, and how many survive, is not known. But the makers of Terra Chips are in the vanguard of what economists say is a measured manufacturing renaissance in a city that has lost more than two-thirds of its factory jobs in the last 30 years.
Many of these new businesses are spinoffs from service industries like publishing and restaurants, explained Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. A study he recently completed also found that small manufacturers had a better rate of survival in New York than in the suburbs or the rest of the nation, mostly because of the relative ease of finding a market here.
New York, said Hugh O'Neill, an economic development consultant, "is simultaneously the best and the worst place to do business. You have the greatest opportunities here, but you also have some of the greatest hassles to overcome."
 
Starting Up

In the beginning, there was Restaurant Lafayette on East 56th Street, a now-closed showcase for Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose Asian-infused classical cooking drew raves from critics and resumes from aspiring chefs like Mr. Dzieduszycki (pronounced JED-due-SCHITZ-key) and Mr. Sinkler. They started work at Restaurant Lafayette within a few months of each other in 1987 and worked together on the fish station and elsewhere in the kitchen.
Mr. Dzieduszycki -- who is 34 years old, grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich., and trained in Europe after graduating from the American Culinary Federation -- left first. He was followed a few months later by Mr. Sinkler, also 34, a native of Charleston, S.C., who studied at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.
In March 1989, they decided to go into business together as Dana Alexander Inc., a catering company aimed at big spenders and their entertaining habits.
They were determined to be different.
"There are millions of catering companies, so to compete, you have to be special," Mr. Sinkler said. "Every party you'd go to, without fail, you'd see crudites and dip, crudites and dip."
Both chefs had learned to make fried vegetable chips at Restaurant Lafayette. Now, in pursuit of an alternative to crudites and dip, they began experimenting with various vegetable chips, with various levels of success. Beets were too sugary and lacked "vascular integrity"; rutabagas were no better. Taro worked especially well and could be colored with beet juice to make a highly desired red chip. They scraped and sliced the vegetables themselves and cooked them painstakingly in a wok.
For inspiration, they explored Asian greengroceries in Chinatown and Hispanic markets in East Harlem. What ended up as Terra Chips is a mosaic of international vegetables -- yuca, batata (a kind of tuber), parsnip, sweet potato, taro and beet-colored taro -- that are largely ignored by American manufacturers.
Mr. Dzieduszycki recalls what happened when they put out the chips at a Christmas party in 1989: "Forty people devoured a basket in seconds flat. It was just rather obvious that we had something there that deserved more attention than we were giving it."
 
Name That Chip
 For one thing, there was the matter of a name. It came from Willi Jones, a singer and Mr. Sinkler's wife at the time. "Terra," Mr. Sinkler explained. "Of the earth."
Then, in September 1990, without ever really looking for retail clients, they landed a big one: Saks Fifth Avenue. "If we could come up with five cases a day, that was great," Mr. Sinkler recalled. "But then Saks placed an order for 50 cases."
Terra Chips were in the mainstream; now they had to be mass-produced.
A few months earlier, Mr. Sinkler and Mr. Dzieduszycki had leased a 1,200-square-foot factory space at 410 East 13th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A, to keep up with the demand for their catering. It was set up for food products; it had been used to make cheese sticks. Now, they shelved the catering business and invested $50,000 in the space, devoting half to offices and half to production. Mr. Dzieduszycki recalls the neighborhood as convulsed with crack dealing.
But the chips took off. Packaged in a silvery foil bag, they were labeled with a sticker that featured line drawings of the chips. Back then, the mix included lotus root (since dropped because it was too expensive) and cost $8.99 for an eight-ounce bag.
The company had no advertising budget (and still doesn't, Mr. Dzieduszycki says), but the chips -- eaten in restaurants and at parties, in club dining rooms and at gallery openings -- began to generate interest on their own. When they did try to promote them with demonstrations at department stores and food markets, they focused not on nutritional advantages but on social ones.
"We've always tried to promote them as a wonderful product for entertaining," Mr. Dzieduszycki said. "You open the bag and pour the chips out and you've got an instant conversation piece."
Part of the appeal, to be sure, was a widespread misconception that they are healthful, which can be attributed, at least partly, to a convergence of the natural-food and fancy-food markets.
"We don't make any claims of being a health food," said Jack Acree, a former lifeguard who joined the company in 1990 as sales director and now owns 1 percent of its stock. "But we are all natural. No preservatives or additives."
And, Mr. Sinkler pointed out, they are healthier than potato chips: The fat content, for example, is 7 grams an ounce, compared with 10 for Wise potato chips; the same portion contains 70 milligrams of sodium, as compared with 190 for Wise's chips.)
Meantime, Terra Chips were also thought to be very cool, very New York -- in part because of price, in part because of packaging and in part just because they are different.
Nadia Donato, a spokeswoman for the Royalton, a midtown hotel that stocks one-ounce bags of Terra Chips in its minibars, said: "Our hotel is very up to date and into everything, and Terra Chips is pretty much top of the line and up to date."
Mr. Acree added: "We had a clientele that could support that kind of price. And people would come through the city, buy our chips, go home and we'd get calls from store owners in Shaker Heights, Ohio, asking, 'Can we get your product?' "
 
A Big Problem

By 1991, the partners needed more space. They searched the city and settled on an old Greenpoint pickle factory that already had refrigeration and other costly equipment. That October, they signed a lease for 9,500 square feet.
Then they hit a real hurdle. The high-pressure gas-fired equipment they had bought required an unusual gas line: two pounds of pressure and 1.1 million B.T.U.'s of volume. They were sold a $10,000 piece of equipment known as a booster, designed to enable them to use a regular gas line.
"They never should have made the sale," Mr. Dzieduszycki said, explaining that the company, Eclipse Combustion, had sold them a machine that was not approved for use in New York City.
A back-and-forth ensued between Dana Alexander, the city's Department of Buildings, Brooklyn Union Gas and Eclipse. And that discussion led to expensive delays. In all, the application and approval process took from April 1992 to November of that year. In the end, an entire new gas line was installed, and the booster was relegated to the dustbin of chipmaking.
A spokesman for the Buildings Department, Vahe Tiryakian, said that most of the delay came from Dana Alexander, which had to submit reports and other paper work. The gas line itself took about three months to approve and install, said Bob Loftus, a spokesman for Brooklyn Union Gas.
"We're here for public safety," Mr. Tiryakian said, adding that efforts were under way to eliminate some of the paperwork that clogs his bureaucracy.
Mr. Moss of New York University believes that such processes contribute even more to the demise of small businesses in the city than high taxes do. "The greatest single burden firms face are the regulatory hassles," he said, listing environmental, transportation and building-code requirements as chief among them.
To Mr. Dzieduszycki, "the city's criteria are correct as far as safety is concerned." But, he added, "even our architect didn't know how to answer half these questions."
While the partners waited for the city to approve their equipment, orders kept coming in. They converted the Manhattan office space to production, and brought as much other work as they could to Brooklyn.
"We were cooking and packaging on 13th Street," Mr. Dzieduszycki recalled. "We had a little office on 11th Street, and then I was over in Brooklyn, trying to get the place on line and get through all these logistical issues. We knew in the back of our minds that the competition was going to be beating on our door any minute. It was very, very stressful."
It turned out to be a good thing that the new factory was just across the East River from the original one.. At one point, vegetables were being sliced in Brooklyn and trucked to Manhattan, fried there and driven back to Brooklyn for distribution.
To help finance the expansion, Dana Alexander raised capital by selling 5 percent of itself to "friends and family," said Mr. Sinkler, who is the company president. (He and Mr. Dzieduszycki, the vice president, share the other 94 percent equally.) The partners also looked into getting money and tax breaks from various city programs, but they were told that they didn't qualify, since they had been operating their factory for less than two years.
"We just never really fit the bill exactly, and it was difficult to get the information about the programs and difficult to get the answers to your questions," Mr. Dzieduszycki said. "You have to know how to work the system."
In May 1992, the company was approved for a $125,000 loan from the State Urban Development Corporation at an interest rate of 1 percent for the first year, followed by 4 percent for the remaining three to five years of the loan. This was at a time when commercial rates were 8 or 9 percent. But it was 17 months from when they first applied before the money showed up, Mr. Sinkler said, glowering.
Steve Vitoff, a spokesman for the development corporation, said nine months elapsed between the approval and the awarding of the loan, because of the way the program, known as Small and Medium-Sized Business Assistance, is set up. Approval meant that the partners could go to a commercial lender and get a loan, at commercial rates, with state backing. The state loan was then used to repay the commercial lender.
"Basically, they would have received the loan upon satisfactory completion of the construction," he said, calling the loan "an excellent example of how this process is supposed to work." However, he added: "These programs are under consistent review with extensive input from business people on how to expedite and accelerate them. It's an important and legitimate goal."
The company also borrowed $150,000 from Citibank and has a $250,000 line of credit, which it tries not to use, Mr. Dzieduszycki said. He would not say how much was raised in teh stock sale.
Finally, last November, Dana Alexander completed its move. It has grown from 17 to 45 workers and supervisors; everyone who was employed in Manhattan made the move. They arrive in staggered shifts starting at 5 A.M.; work stops around 7 P.M. The workers, many of them from the neighborhood, include Poles, Dominicans and Chinese. They wear white uniforms and are paid a minimum of $6 per hour. They have paid holidays and health insurance.
As a souvenir of the company's maddening move, Dana Alexander is suing Eclipse Combustion, now known as Eclipse Inc., which is based in Rockford, Ill. The partners are seeking $590,000 to cover losses and costs stemming from the troublesome booster, Mr. Dzieduszycki said. John Myers, a vice president at Eclipse, said the company would have no comment on an unresolved legal matter.
 
What Comes After Success?
 Since Terra Chips started being produced on an industrial scale, Mr. Acree said, sales have doubled every year. (These days, only about 10 percent of the chips are sold in New York City, with the rest scattered across the country.) This year, sales are expected to total $10 million, with net profits of about $1 million this year. The owners still bicycle to work, and dress casually around the office, in ponytails and shorts and running shoes.
The story of Terra Chips underscores what some economists say is an end to the retreat of manufacturing in the city. According to recent figures from the state's Labor Department, a modest expansion seems to be underway, especially in Brooklyn and Queens.
To Professor Moss, the company epitomizes a successful city start-up, 90's-style. He cited a recent study of 7,500 city manufacturers, conducted by his center, that, using data from 1984 to 1987, foundthat start-up companies in New York City had a 95.6 percent survival rate three years later, compared to 66 percent in the suburbs. In recent months, Terra Chips have gone on sale in single-flavor bags. For the partners, who say the want to license production "in every corner of the globe," the next stage of growth will be far more complex. Should they take on investors? Should they stay in the city? Should they add new products?
The answers, the experts say, will tell as much about the resilience of the new signs of manufacturing life as about the future of Dana Alexander.
"That is one of the most critical transitions, and when it comes time to make that leap, it's very hard to do that in New York," said Mr. O'Neill, who runs Appleseed, a Manhattan consulting group.
The city's discouraging factors, he said, include high costs, from rent to parking tickets to taxes, and the physical difficulties of getting around. In addition, he said, the city often fails to recognize the strength that small companies lend to the economy.
"A common complaint is that the economic-development management is too cumbersome, especially for small businesses," he said. "There's much more emphasis here on procedural requirements. From the point of view of a small businessman, it's just maddening red tape."
At the Urban Development Corporation, officials defend their conservatism as being in the public interest. "The U.D.C. directors need to scrutinize the applicants to make sure they are worthy beneficiaries of a public sector investment," Mr. Vitoff said.
At City Hall, the Giuliani administration says it is working "to create an environment in which small businesses can flourish." To that end, said Forrest R. Taylor, a spokesman, "the Mayor has instituted and is planning a number of initiatives to make New York City more business-friendly."
Among these efforts, some of which have already begun, are the Bid-Match program, which allows entrepreneurs to find out about potential city contracts on a computer database; the creation of borough offices to deal with small-business problems "door to door," and the scaling back of the often-criticized commercial rent tax, with the aim of eliminating it entirely by 1997, except in Manhattan south of 96th Street.
For their part, the owners of Terra Chips say they are weighing alternatives and have made no major decisions. Yet. But they acknowledge, somewhat nostalgically, that their most exciting days in business are probably behind them.
"We were chefs. We were just winging it," Mr. Dzieduszycki said. "We had a tremendous amount of common sense, but that doesn't answer all your questions."

Flatiron Map: Jigsaw Puzzle of Competing Claims

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE 

 BODY:
Six months ago the Flatiron district -- named for its 22-story, triangular skyscraper -- was relatively low-profile. Now, it is the newest -- and one of the better publicized -- of the city's up-and-coming business districts.
Problem is, the area the district claims is already home to all or parts of three associations (including a Flatiron District Neighborhood Association) and one business improvement district. And some of their leaders are not at all pleased by the new territorial claims. 
 "There's no need for another organization in this area," said William L. Haines, head of the Lower Fifth Avenue Association.
Rob Walsh, director of the 14th Street Business Improvement District, said: "I hope its a rookie mistake by an enthusiastic volunteer organization." He added: "I hope we won't trip over one another; a turf war won't do any good."
It started early this year, when Brian Moss, who has owned and operated Better Bodies gym on West 19th Street since 1982, realized he did not know anybody in the neighborhood. "It was very frustrating," said Mr. Moss, who wrote letters to a score of other businesses in the area, inviting them to meet and discuss local concerns.
His Good Neighbor effort caught on, and in June, the Flatiron District Business Association was born. It has 120 members, paying dues that range from $50 for a resident to $200 for a ground-floor business.
"We grappled with ourselves to define what is the Flatiron District," said Claudia Strauss, executive director. In the end, she said, the map was "architecturally driven," emphasizing the unity of the grand old department store buildings in the Ladies' Mile Historic District.
The tension takes place amid a confusing welter of similar-sounding terms. District business associations, business improvement districts, associations and partnerships are all nonprofit organizations that generally share a basic aim: improving the quality of life. What differs is the nature of their financing and services -- and their clout.
"A B.I.D. is a legal entity that levies assessments on all property owners in its designated area and provides regular services, such as sanitation and security, to supplement city services," said Bruce Cohen, a press representative who has worked with several business improvement districts.
Associations and partnerships, which sometimes become B.I.D.s, have voluntary members that pay dues or donations, providing a variety of services on an irregular basis.
Some of the businesses that fall amid the twice- or thrice-claimed territories are simply paying their dues and hoping it is all worthwhile. ABC Carpet and Home, at 888 Broadway between 18th and 19th Streets, belongs to the 14th Street Business Improvement District, the 23d Street Association and the new Flatiron association, paying a total annual fee of less than $1,000 a year.
Is it worth it? "Absolutely, yes," said Kevan Cole, ABC's president. MARVINE HOWE

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: 34TH STREET;
New Merchants Make It a Resurrection on 34th Street

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
The remake of "Miracle on 34th Street" will head to theaters in November. But among business watchers, something of a miracle has already happened: after a decade of the domino deaths of its department store giants, 34th Street is re-emerging as the midtown heart of middlebrow shopping.
"It's hotter than hot -- there's so much demand for 34th Street there's not enough space to fill it," said Faith Consolo, a partner in Garrick-Aug, the nation's largest retail leasing agency. 
 As the geographic and economic midpoint between the 57th and 14th Street shopping strips, 34th serves a broad band of tastes and budgets. Macy's and stores to the east have an uptown flavor, while the south side and west end of 34th are more bargain basement, with many open-air storefronts.
Many new arrivals are of the mega-store, discount variety -- the ones Mayor Giuliani is most interested in tempting to the boroughs. Kmart is coming, the district's first new big department store in five years. And Daffy's clothing, Sports Authority and HMV Music are on the way. More big money is moving into the street's infrastructure: about $500 million has gone into renovations for Madison Square Garden, the Long Island Rail Road terminal and a new library.
Some changes are invisible at street level: the Garden and its Paramount, Knicks, Rangers and MSG TV were just sold for $1 billion. Macy's and Federated Department Stores are merging for $4 billion.
Macy's merger could lead Federated to close A&S. But there is interest in that and nearby sites from Sears, Penney's, Nordstrom, Lord and Taylor, Bradlee's and Caldor. Retailers viewed A&S as a high-risk gamble when it opened in 1989, but Mark Finkelstein of Retail Strategies, a brokerage, said, "Now there are many stores eager to take that over."
All this is a stunning turnaround from the street's near-death experience when Gimbels, Altman's, Korvettes, Orbachs, Saks 34th and Herald Center went under as suburbia flourished with new-style speciality and discount stores. Even more ominously, Macy's -- the sole surviving big store and cornerstone of the district -- fell into bankruptcy. Norman Sturner of Murray Hill Properties recalled, "That was a disaster -- 34th could have completely collapsed."
But Macy's hung on, and its drawing power is part of the street's inherent strength. In a two-block radius of 34th and Seventh Avenue are 698 retailers with yearly sales of $612 million, 109,000 workers earning $3 billion, and tourist meccas like the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. From Fifth to Eighth Avenue are 11 bus routes, 13 subways, Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, and both ends of 34th connect with tunnels, ferries and heliports -- an unparalleled combination.
And the more the street thrives, the more allure it has for business. GHI, the insurer, has taken over an entire building, part of the district's 31 million square feet of offices.
Reinvestment helped, as did a belated economic recovery, better terms in the battered real-estate market, improvements in the garment industry north of 34th and thriving Koreatown to the south. So did the 1992 Democratic National Convention, with a local cleanup and Bill Clinton's televised stroll from Macy's to Madison Square Garden.
A business improvement district, the 34th Street Partnership, began that year. It painted lampposts, picked up litter, scrubbed off graffiti, hired security patrols and even cracked down on garish signs. Streets brightened and crime plummeted.
The crowds all that brings are 34th Street's essence. In July, counters at the southeast corner of the Avenue of the Americas saw 8,186 pedestrians from 5 to 6 P.M. Ms. Consolo said, "Retailers who try traffic studies there give up -- they get trampled." BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: Present Arms;
Clinton Corners Himself, Along With His Quarry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEREVER he is, the late Lyndon Baines Johnson surely is shaking his head in wonderment at the current plight of his onetime critic, Bill Clinton, who is now President. No, Haiti is hardly Vietnam, not as a foe; not as a moral dilemma; probably not as a military quagmire. Yet 26 years after Mr. Clinton took to the streets to assail Mr. Johnson's war, he now finds himself, eerily, starring in its revival on the small stage: the principled President, drawn ever deeper into an unpopular battle by his own policies and a fear that retreat equals humiliation.
 So it was that a superpower threat to invade one of the world's weakest nations ballooned last week into a do-or-die test of the President's political manhood and diplomatic respect. It is not that Mr. Clinton lacks for intelligent arguments that his course, morally and historically, is right. But even many of those Democrats who believe Mr. Clinton is right to threaten military action suspect that he has arrived at that choice not by design, but by default. After repeated bluster in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti -- followed by repeated retreat in each instance -- Mr. Clinton simply cannot afford to rattle another empty scabbard if he is to maintain the status of a world leader, they say.
 
 "Now they're faced with the stark reality that they have got to invade," a Democrat on the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee said last week in an interview. "They'll never be able to make a bluff anywhere in the world if they threaten to invade Haiti and back down."
 Few in Washington disagree with the President's broad goals: to end the dictatorship of Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, to halt the political torture and murder, to restore to office Haiti's first democratically elected president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. No one disputes his ultimate aim, to sweep back the tide of refugees fleeing Haiti for economic or political salvation in the United States. And Mr. Clinton could credibly argue that his ultimatum to Haiti's dictators effectively continued a policy wielded against dictatorships in Grenada and Panama by Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
 Mr. Clinton's quagmire is not strategic, however, but acutely political. In Port-au-Prince, the military appears to have concluded it could step over Mr. Clinton's latest line in the sand because it had crossed others in the last 18 months with such impunity. The White House appears to have miscalculated General Cedras's stamina -- and, as a result, to have drawn furious new demands for tougher steps from hunger strikers, from blocs in Congress, from Florida politicians, from Father Aristide.
 And on Capitol Hill, Mr. Clinton is seen as having placed American credibility on the line without bothering to bring voters or lawmakers along -- a key to making any threat convincing.
 Mr. Clinton seemed to make a bow to that argument Friday, sending Jimmy Carter, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and retired Gen. Colin Powell to make a final pitch for General Cedras' peaceful departure. They were sent after Mr. Clinton's backers in the Capitol warned he was rushing into battle without having rallied political support or exhausted all options.
 Yet even his supporters allowed that Mr. Clinton had moved the crisis to such a pitch that, should that last plea fail, he had no choice but to invade or lose all credibility. "What we're trying to prove," said Representative Lee Hamilton, of Indiana, "is that we mean what we say."
 That has not always been so clear.
 When General Cedras ousted Father Aristide in September 1991, President Bush called it a threat to American security and vowed that the coup would not stand, but did little else. When Mr. Bush ordered the military to intercept Haitian refugees at sea and return them home, Presidential candidate Clinton vowed to reverse it and return Father Aristide to power.
 
The Power-Sharing Solution
 President Clinton quickly broke that pledge. For one thing, he realized -- as had Mr. Bush -- that accepting the boat people would encourage a greater exodus. For another, he adopted the early view of his aides that Haiti would never be stable unless its ruling military and business elite were part of any political settlement. So he began to bargain with General Cedras not for the restoration of Father Aristide, but for a power-sharing accord. But for this to work the generals had to be persuaded that they had no other choice. They had already shown they could withstand sanctions almost indefinitely. Without a convincing threat to oust them, they proved extraordinarily difficult to persuade.
 For a while, Father Aristide lashed out at his erstwhile White House allies. Then he proved sufficiently pliant about the need to reassure the wealthy that the White House succeeded in brokering a United Nations accord in mid-1993 under which General Cedras agreed to cede power. But there was a critical flaw: The general faced no punishment if he reneged.
 And he did. Then, when the White House sent the U.S.S. Harlan County that October to enforce the deal, a gang of Cedras thugs met it at the Port-au-Prince dock.
 It was a crucial moment, perhaps the last opportunity to persuade General Cedras that he, like Father Aristide, had no choice but to compromise. Instead, the ship steamed away, and Mr. Clinton's credibility sank in its wake. So negotiation had produced only a humiliation, and this strengthened the belief that Washington, whatever its threats, would not move beyond economic punishment to the use of force.
 
Then Came the Protests
 There matters rested, until black lawmakers in Congress began suggesting last spring that Mr. Clinton's apparent indifference to Haiti's travails was racist. An activist, Randall Robinson, began a 27-day hunger strike to underscore the point. Astonishingly, Mr. Clinton publicly endorsed the strike, saying that "we ought to change our policy." In May, Mr. Clinton did change it -- again -- persuading the United Nations to impose a total trade and travel embargo.
 Since then Mr. Clinton has eased the ban on processing Haitian boat people, tightened it again, won United Nations permission for an invasion, and moved warships offshore. He declared on Wednesday that the time for negotiations had passed. But on Friday, he elected to allow American emissaries to talk with General Cedras.
 In the end, the President appears to have returned to his position as a Presidential candidate: that returning refugees to Haiti is inhumane, and that the United States should return Father Aristide to power. But it is a course that even allies judge to be tentative and wracked by indecision.
 "The Clinton Administration has not made its case very well," said Robert White, a former ambassador to El Salvador who is president of the generally liberal Center for International Policy. "The lack of discipline inside the Administration hasn't only been notable; it's sent all kinds of mixed messages, conflicting messages to the military." Mr. White, who strongly favors military action to oust General Cedras if need be, says the Administration is bereft of an effective advocate for its position.
 So is Mr. Clinton's party in Congress.
 "There's no lack of consultation," said one Central America expert, an adviser for decades to Senate Democrats. "What's missing is the kind of relationship in which the Administration says, 'This is what we're going to do, and we need your support.' What's missing is what, in the insurance business, they call a closer."
 Foreign policy is nominally bipartisan, but in this case, should any military action go poorly, Mr. Clinton will be utterly alone.
 There is a good likelihood that it will not go poorly, however. Mr. White, a longtime scholar on Caribbean issues, suggests that Haiti's citizens will welcome American liberation, making pacification an uncomplicated task. "We're going to be surprised, if we don't tie Aristide's hands too tightly, at how quickly Haiti starts to function," he said.
 Perhaps so, with a wing and a prayer. But whatever happens on the ground, Mr. Clinton's credibility gap on foreign policy seems destined to yawn wide as ever. "Clinton could say tomorrow that he's decided not to invade Haiti," said another aide to a senior senator on the Foreign Relations panel, "and you know what? Not one senator would care."

Blessed Are the Forgiven, For They Shall Run Again

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Mayor returned triumphantly to office after serving nearly six months in jail. He blamed his troubles with the law on his political enemies who, threatened by his power, had set out to get him. But now, the Mayor was as powerful as before.
 That sounds like the story of Marion S. Barry, who last week staged one of the most audacious comebacks in political history: four years after the former Mayor of the District of Columbia was caught on videotape smoking crack and convicted on drug charges, he won the Democratic Mayoral primary.
 
 But it is the story of James Michael Curley, who was a Mayor of Boston in the early 1900's and one of the most resilient politicians of his time. Despite several brushes with the law, including his conviction for mail fraud, Mr. Curley was elected Mayor four times over four decades.
 Mr. Barry's nomination, which almost insures his election, is the latest in a rich, yet quirky, American tradition of elected officials disgracing their offices and then turning their transgressions to political advantage. Like Mr. Curley, Mr. Barry did not apologize for his offenses. Both blamed their predicaments on the established power structure. Mr. Curley, the tribune of Irish immigrants, lashed out at the prominent Brahmins of Beacon Hill; Mr. Barry's venom was at the powerful white institutions that he said plotted to bring him down.
 "There's a striking similarity in their appeals," said Jack Beatty, author of a biography of Mr. Curley, "The Rascal King" (Addison-Wesley, 1992). "Both had a grasp for the politics of revenge; striking back at the respectable people, at the people who haven't been to jail, at the people who are outraged that this affront to the municipal consciousness should still be on the stage."
 But history shows that lack of discretion, or downright flouting of the law, does not always kill a political career. A term in jail, as Mr. Barry and Mr. Curley demonstrated, can be worn like a badge of courage.
 Representative Thomas J. Lane, a Democrat from Lawrence, Mass., was the first congressman re-elected, in 1956, after serving jail time -- four months for tax evasion. Voters did not seem to mind his criminal record because, like Mr. Barry and Mr. Curley, he was known for tending to the concerns of constituents.
 
Local Hero
 Another congressman who, like Mr. Lane, died earlier this year was Representative Daniel J. Flood, a debonair Democrat from northeastern Pennsylvania who was known for his villainous-looking mustache. To some, he was a crook who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980. But he was a hero to the coal miners and flood victims in his district. Though forced to resign after his guilty plea, Mr. Flood was re-elected between two trials.
 Mr. Barry's resurrection is also reminiscent of the case of Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who was charged several times but never convicted. His fellow members of Congress excluded him for assorted financial improprieties, but the voters thought otherwise and re-elected him.
 David S. Bositis, a senior analyst for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, said that Mr. Powell's constituents cared more about what he could do for them than his own legal troubles.
 "People do not elect their leaders to be upright," Mr. Bositis said. "They want them to do something. If someone serves in office for 20 years and all they can say is they're honest, you can also say they were a lousy, ineffective leader."
 An important reason that Mr. Barry prevailed was that among the poor and disenfranchised, he was remembered as an effective leader. His two major opponents, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and Councilman John Ray, are both black, but they were viewed by poor blacks as too close to the white power structure. Of the three, only Mr. Barry was active in the civil rights movement, and only he was viewed as an advocate for the poor.
 Like Mr. Curley, Mr. Barry is known for appealing to peoples' self-interest; both reached out to help the down-and-out, even if it meant bloating the city budget with patronage appointments and public works jobs.
 Paul Costello, a former communications director for Mayor Kelly, said Mr. Barry's drug conviction is not startling to voters in poor neighborhoods to whom drug arrests are a daily part of life; and they think he was set up anyway.
 "So he went to jail for smoking crack; he gave my kid a summer job, he provided a job in city government for my parents, he touched my grandparent at a senior center," Mr. Costello said. "He enables people in the poorest, most devastated part of the city to believe in someone. But I think it's a charade."
 Charade or not, it seems to be working. Perhaps in an era when people are more contemptuous of their politicians than ever, voters have developed a new sense of morality: Since they are all bad, I'll vote for the politician who can do the most for me. In the case of Mr. Barry's supporters, it may not be so much a matter of forgiveness as much as a refusal to forgive the powers-that-be for doing him in.
 Another recent comeback was made by Representative Daniel J. Rosentkowski, the influential Chicago Democrat. Despite his indictment for defrauding the Government, Mr. Rostenkowski managed to win a contentious primary early this year. It was not because people were certain of his innocence, but because what mattered most was that Mr. Rostenkowski had a record of dispensing pork to his district.
 
Just Following Orders
 On the other end of the political spectrum, Oliver L. North, in his bid for Senate from Virginia, is playing the same politics. He has refused to apologize for the Iran-contra scandal, and instead has lashed out at the power structure in Washington -- Democrats and Republicans -- for conspiring against him. The message clearly has some appeal -- at least enough that Mr. North won the Republican nomination to take on Senator Charles S. Robb in November.
 Just as Mr. Barry's supporters overlooked his drug conviction, Mr. North's supporters overlooked his admission that he lied to Congress -- and prefer to focus on his talk of shaking up Washington and ending the Democratic hold on Congress. Todd Wilkowski, a 27-year-old student, put it this way after hearing Mr. North speak at a rally in Norfolk, last week: "Sometimes, you have to follow orders."

The Economist's 'Just So' Story

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON 

 BODY:
It didn't quite pack the wallop of Demi Moore posing nude and pregnant, but the cover of The Economist -- with a photo of an evidently impassioned pair of humped beasts to illustrate the magazine's lead editorial, "The Trouble with Mergers" -- caused a bit of a stir on Wall Street last week. Not all of the talk was negative.
"Reaction has been roughly divided 50-50," said Bill Emmott, the editor of the very serious but rarely somber international news magazine, which is based in London. "Fifty percent disgusted and 50 percent highly amused." 
 The controversial cover appeared in The Economist's North American edition (circulation about 275,000) and the Asian-Australian edition (about 60,000), not in its European edition (250,000). Readers in the Old World were deprived or spared, depending on one's perspective.
Mr. Emmott was mildly surprised at having rubbed American sensibilities against the grain.
"Actually, a story on mergers is not that easy to illustrate," he observed. "We looked at a lot of pictures of copulating animals, I tell you, and this was the funniest." JOHN DARNTON

HEADLINE: Word for Word: The Health Care Papers;
Now It Can Be Told: The Task Force Was Bold and Naive and Collegial

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON'S 20 months in the White House have been dominated by health care: the Administration's secretive efforts to write a health plan, followed by the agony of watching Congress tear it apart.
 The urgency, boldness, creativity, political naivete, confusion and frustrations of the Administration are revealed in rich detail in thousands of pages of documents made public this month. The Administration fought for 18 months to keep the records secret. But, rather than defend its position in court, the White House voluntarily released the documents by turning them over to the National Archives in College Park, Md.
 
 The documents come from the staff of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, which included more than 500 experts on health policy, medicine, insurance and taxes. Many of these experts never expected their memorandums to become public. The memos that follow show that the policy-making process was often like a big, free-wheeling college seminar which considered dozens of policy options without reaching a clear consensus. ROBERT PEAR
 
Anticipating Criticism
 From a "preliminary work plan" sent on Jan. 26, 1993, by Ira C. Magaziner, coordinator of the task force, to members of the panel. The White House correctly anticipated criticism of the President's plan, but did too little to satisfy or disprove the critics.
 The United States is in the midst of a health care crisis.
 Health care costs are high and growing rapidly (14 percent of G.D.P. in 1992, expected to reach at least 18 percent by 2000). Rising health care costs are placing a tremendous burden on individuals, businesses and governments and are erasing gains in living standards. . . .
 
Likely Criticisms
 Any comprehensive health reform plan will be controversial. Some criticisms would apply to any plan; others are specific to the type of managed competition with global budgets proposed by President Clinton. Criticisms are likely to center on the following arguments:

1. Cost containment would be ineffective and have perverse results.
 *Little evidence exists that managed care networks will produce efficiencies and thus deliver the cost containment we require; the result will be reliance on existing perverse behaviors (e.g., risk selection, claims denials) to meet global ceilings.
 *Limiting spending on health care through global budgets will lead to service rationing, and interfere with quality improvements and consumers' traditional freedom to spend.

2. Universal coverage would involve redistribution of income and disrupt satisfactory arrangements for many Americans. The result would be to increase rather than reduce many Americans' costs of care.
 *Community rating of insurance premiums would raise costs for currently insured populations who are young, male and healthy. . . .
 *Requirements to purchase coverage would lower disposable incomes for individuals who have gone without health insurance.

3. The plan would be cumbersome.
 *Consumers would have to deal with new and unfamiliar agencies ("purchasing cooperatives") and choose from among plans they feel ill-equipped to evaluate.
 *Unanticipated barriers to service would be erected when people are sick.
 *Unanticipated financial obligations would be imposed on people who wanted to use providers not included in their plan.

4. Many small businesses may fiercely resist the proposal.
 *Even with subsidies for low-wage or newly insuring employers, our plan would impose premium requirements that small business groups and other critics will challenge as:
 -- A "payroll tax."
 -- A threat to current jobs.
 -- A threat to small business development and job creation.
 In designing our reforms, we must take cognizance of these potential criticisms. We need to allow states flexibility to use alternative models that may make sense for them.
 
Treasury Concerns
 From a confidential memorandum by James R. Ukockis, a senior economist at the Treasury Department, to Alicia H. Munnell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for Economic Policy, and Marina Weiss, her deputy, on Feb. 23, 1993.
 In short, the primary focus is now definitely on budget savings. Total savings to the economy is only a distant second, and improving total social benefits from the health sector is not even a consideration. . . .
 It appears the worst fears about the short-term cost containment efforts are coming true. The process is being driven by a narrow focus on the need for budgetary savings. The imperative for such savings is viewed as so strong it is used to justify risking major dislocations in the health care system. Those risks are dismissed with a vague assurance any problems caused will be taken care of by the phasing in of the (as yet undefined) long-term reform program. . . .
 If, in fact, we go forward with a price control program justified by, and designed to obtain, maximum budgetary savings, we may well find ourselves in the position of the general in Vietnam who declared with a straight face, "We had to destroy the village in order to save it." It was not a successful formula in Vietnam, and it will not be a successful formula in health care.
 From a memorandum by Mr. Ukockis to Ms. Munnell and Ms. Weiss on March 10, 1993.
 My reading of the matter is we have a massive case of policy constipation. We are halfway through the 100-day period, and I am unaware of any policy choices having been made to narrow the focus of the work. Issues of increasingly peripheral character are still being targeted for further study, with the output doing little but postponing and clogging up the policy decision process.
 It may be the problem is the presence of too many academics, whose intellectual interest in the policy issues far exceeds their understanding of the needs of a successful policy-making process.
 
'Not Good Policy'
 From a memorandum to Mr. Magaziner by Leonard Abramson, chief executive of U.S. Healthcare, which operates health maintenance organizations, on May 10, 1993. Mr. Abramson served on one of several "audit teams" that reviewed the task force's work.
 After some additional reflection on the elements of the reform proposal which our auditing group considered last week, I want to reiterate the following:
 The proposal needs a focus and identity that is presently missing. It tries to straddle the line between free-market competition and governmental bureaucratic regulation, but does neither one well. This is not good policy, nor will the merits of such a plan be easy to communicate to the American people or Congress.
 The bureaucratic route is not a desirable course. The additional bureaucracies now envisioned will take time to set up and even more time to function adequately, will be fraught with the problems that beset any bureaucracy, and will only add another layer of expense and inefficiency to the health care system. The health alliance concept, if it is to be successful, should aim for structuring competition, not stifling it.
