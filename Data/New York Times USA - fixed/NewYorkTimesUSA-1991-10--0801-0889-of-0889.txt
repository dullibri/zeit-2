HEADLINE: Market Place;
Soviet Gold News Has Little Impact

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
THE recent disclosure by a top Soviet official that his nation had far less in gold reserves than was thought in the West has had surprisingly little impact on the price of gold, which has jumped by just over $11 an ounce, or 3.3 percent, since mid-September.
Gold is still near the bottom of its recent trading range, and, at $358 an ounce yesterday, is far from the peaks of $400-plus that it touched a few times since February 1990. And gold analysts do not expect the price to move significantly higher, although the Soviet acknowledgement was one of the first pieces of positive news for the gold market in some time. 
 Some estimates call for a possible price of $400 an ounce, or a bit more, next year, but there is no expectation of a monster rally that could bring gold back to the center of investors' attention.
Prices of gold stocks have risen much more than the price of bullion recently, but this is normal. An increase in gold prices goes directly to the bottom line, once production costs are covered, and has a multiplier effect on earnings that is greater than the percentage increase in the price of gold.
In the United States, Merrill Lynch's gold index is up 14 percent since mid-September. The gold index for Canadian shares is up 10.7 percent in United States dollars; the Australian index is up 11.5 percent in American dollars, and the South African index is 6.2 percent higher in the period.
But the rally in gold stocks can turn around quickly if the price of gold does not hold. Prices could also fall if the rally is powered by the anticipation of higher gold prices that do not materilize.
"It is like surfing," Warren Myers, vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, said of the stock prices. "It is a wonderful ride. The trick is to get off at the right time."
The reason the gold price has not moved much is because the market has become a backwater in the financial market; just a tributary in the flow of money around the world. The market has been depressed by years of bad price performance and undermined by oversupply. And it will take more than the bullish Soviet news to bring back enough investors to push the price back up.
"We have found that the investors and the gold bugs of the early 1980's have been driven out," said Bruce L. Kaplan, president of Kaplan & Company, a precious-metals consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif. "It is going to take a long time before people get re-interested in gold.
"In years past," he added, referring to the Soviet disclosures, "this news would have sparked the gold investors. Then they were hanging on every word. But they have canceled their gold newsletters and they have moved to the stock market."
Stephen Pepper, senior vice president of the Republic National Bank, added: "If it is true, it should be bullish for gold in the long term. But it has not brought back the kind of buying that I would have thought of with this kind of news."
Gold watchers do argue that the Soviet disclosure has put a new floor under gold, meaning that recent predictions of $325 an ounce, or even less, are just about out of the question now.
The disclosure by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the senior Soviet economist and architect of a plan to move the Soviet Union toward a market economy, was made in early October and has since been refined. Mr. Yavlinsky said that Soviet domestic gold reserves had fallen to 240 metric tons, with another 150 metric tons outside the country but already pledged against hard-currency loans.
The figures shocked the gold market, since, for years, analysts -- including those at the Central Inteligence Agency -- had thought the Soviets had up to 800 to 3,000 metric tons of gold. Because of the Government's desperate need for hard currency to support its disintegrating economy, many market analysts had feared that much of this gold would be sold to raise money. These expected gold sales, which would add to the supply of an already depressed commodity, were the threat that was overhanging the market and were helping to hold down the price of gold.
The actual reserves available are still not known, although after the early reports there were several experts, both inside and outside the Soviet Union, who thought the new disclosures were more accurate than the old assumptions.
Theodore Arnold, a metals specialist for Merrill Lynch in London, said that the exact amount did not really matter because it seemed that the number was below the general old consensus of around 1,500 metric tons. And, more important, so much of the gold has probably already been pledged for loans to support the economy that it cannot be sold anyway. So the threat to the market of huge sales is diminished, even if there turns out to be more gold than Mr. Yavlinsky said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Boeing Gets Japan Jet Order; Earnings Rise

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Underscoring the success of the Boeing Company's newest jetliner, Japan Airlines said today that it had placed 20 orders and options for the mid-sized 777's. The order, valued at $2 billion, comes two months after a $3.6 billion order for 777's from British Airways, and brings the number of customers for the new plane to six.
United Airlines is to take first delivery of a 777 in May 1995. 
 Also today, Boeing reported improved earnings and revenue for the third quarter, which it attributed primarily to improved commercial aircraft sales and decreased losses from defense and aerospace business. Boeing shares rose 75 cents today, to close at $49.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Replacing DC-10's
 The Japan Airlines Company selected the 777 to replace aging McDonnell Douglas DC-10's on domestic and regional routes, with deliveries scheduled between 1995 and 1999. As configured for Japan Airlines, the 777 will seat 380 passengers in two classes.
The airline's choice of an engine manufacturer was not disclosed in the announcement. Japan Airlines has traditionally purchased engines primarily from the Pratt & Whitney Company, but it has recently turned to the General Electric Company. Rolls-Royce is a third candidate.
"The willingness of this airline to continue to consider twin-engined equipment is very promising" for Boeing, said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with UBS Phillips & Drew in New York. Japan Airlines "is not about to buy a pig in a poke, but this does suggest that if Boeing can make the 777 do everything they think it can, it will be a very formidable force on trans-Pacific routes," he said.
Japan Airlines is the largest user of Boeing's jumbo jet, the 747; even so, its purchase of the 777 represents a victory for the Seattle-based company. Japan Airlines had already ordered a number of MD-11's, McDonnell Douglas's newest edition of the three-engined DC-10, and a direct competitor to the 777.
 
Growth Despite Recession
 "We're proud to have Boeing's largest wide-body customer put its stamp of approval on our new airplane," said Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, in a statement. "This order from Japan Airlines confirms that we have designed an airplane preferred by major airlines worldwide."
Boeing also reported a 6.1 percent rise in third quarter earnings to $401 million, or $1.17 a share, from $378 million, or $1.10 a share, in the period a year ago. Sales rose 6 percent to $7.66 billion from $7.18 billion.
Despite the continuing recession, few airlines have asked for delays in delivery of new aircraft, and these have to some extent been balanced by requests from other customers for accelerated delivery, Boeing said. No firm orders for jet transports have been canceled, but several airlines have said they would not exercise some of their options, the company said.

HEADLINE: Blue Chips Lead a Rally; Dow Adds 40.70

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks rose strongly yesterday on moderate trading volume, with blue-chip issues leading the broader market. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.70 points, to close at 3,045.62.
Although trading ended on a strong note, many investors remained noncommittal and held neutral positions as they awaited economic reports due out this week; data on third-quarter gross national product is to be released today. 
 According to a survey released yesterday by Bloomberg Business News, economists expect that real G.N.P. rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the third quarter. Optimism about the report pushed the dollar higher yesterday, and that spilled over into stocks, traders said.
Investors are still concerned with corporate earnings and the economy, but afternoon trading received a boost from news reports of remarks by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. In a speech at the University of Rhode Island, he said the economy was slow in coming out of the recession, raising hopes in the stock market for yet another cut in interest rates.
His comments, which were less pessimistic than early reports had indicated, also helped to firm bond prices.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 161.6 million shares, down from the 167.3 million shares Friday. Issues that rose in price outpaced losers by 1,001 to 596.
The Big Board composite index rose 2.62, to 214.44, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 5.32, to 389.52. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.86 points, to 379.29.
Trading in smaller stocks was also active, as the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks gained 4.28, to 529.41, and the Russell 2000 index was up 0.80, to 180.74.
Norman J. Shapiro, a senior vice president for equity trading at Vanguard Securities, said yesterday's rally was led by blue chips that pulled along the rest of the market. He noted strength in the drug sector, where he said investors usually take defensive positions in uncertain markets.
The positive tone was set by the overseas markets and by buying in selected United States issues. Traders had expected the early gains to fade, but Mr. Greenspan's remarks fueled further buying.
Among the closely watched issues yesterday were Comerica and Manufacturers National, two Detroit banks that announced plans to merge. Shares of Manufacturers National were up 3 3/4, to 37 1/2, while Comerica rose 5, to 47 7/8.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Turn For Worse

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
In his gloomiest assessment since last winter, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that the national economy had taken a turn for the worse.
The economy is still growing slightly, Mr. Greenspan told a group of business executives in Providence, R.I., but "in recent weeks, it's turned demonstrably sluggish." 
 Early news service reports characterized Mr. Greenspan's speech as even more pessimistic than it was, and traders in the stock and bond markets took the remarks to mean the Fed would act soon to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 40.70, to 3,045.62, and prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose. [Pages D10 and D22.]
 
No Indication on Rates
 Mr. Greenspan, however, gave no indication even indirectly of what his intentions might be on interest rates. He has recently been under increasing pressure from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and others in the Administration to drive rates lower. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, meets next on Nov. 5.
In July, when he gave Congress his official midyear review of the state of the economy, Mr. Greenspan proclaimed the recession over, reported signs that inflation was slowing, predicted progress on the Federal budget deficit and was otherwise remarkably optimistic.
Today's speech, which he delivered from notes, had a much different tone. The "signs of spark" that could be observed in the economy in the spring and early summer, Mr. Greenspan said, were no longer apparent.
 
'Credit Crunch' Cited
 In addition to not tipping his hand on interest rates, Mr. Greenspan did not say whether other steps should be taken to lift the economy. Many lawmakers of both parties have offered tax-cut proposals in recent days, saying that a cut was necessary to generate a surge in the economy.
Mr. Greenspan referred often today to what he called a "credit crunch" and suggested that it was now the main factor dragging the economy down. "The economy is moving forward, but in the face of a 50-mile-an-hour head wind," he declared.
When bank lending is tight, the growth in the nation's money supply is inhibited, and that inhibition acts as a drain on the economy.
The Federal Reserve has been pushing interest rates down steadily, so that they are now at their lowest point since the 1970's. But since that decline has not led to more bank lending, it has not caused the economy to grow as much as Mr. Greenspan and other officials hoped.
Some Bush Administration officials have been arguing that the main cause of the credit restrictions is overly zealous restrictions placed by bank examiners.
But Mr. Greenspan suggested that more important reasons were the reluctance of banks to lend freely when they have many bad loans already on their books and the disinclination of businesses to borrow money in the face of a weak economy.
 
Focus on Credit
 Most of Mr. Greenspan's speech today was devoted to the credit situation, a problem that is especially severe in New England. Mr. Greenspan implied, although he did not say so directly, that he was not sure whether the inability of creditworthy customers to find loans was a short-term or a long-term phenomenon.
The problem had its roots, he said, in the tax law of 1981, which allowed generous new tax breaks for real estate construction. Many parts of the country experienced a significiant overbuilding of commercial real estate, and banks found that their loans for these buildings were not repaid.
"We just overbuilt to a point that is quite incredible," he said.
Eventually, Mr. Greenspan said, credit will once again become more available. He said that availability would begin when banks see that they have fewer nonperforming loans in their portfolios. Banks will then realize that unless they lend more aggressively, they will lose their share of the market to competitors.

HEADLINE: In Debate on U.S. Poverty, 2 Studies Fuel an Argument on Who Is to Blame

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
For seven consecutive years beginning in 1983, the celebrated American economic expansion brought disappointing results in the fight against poverty, defying historical experience and leaving the country with poverty rates unusually high among prosperous Western nations.
The question has been why. 
 In recent months, two academic studies have addressed that question and come to an unsettling conclusion: America has high poverty rates not because it must, but because it chooses to.
Comparing the United States with selected Western European countries and Canada, the studies contend that with comparable patterns of economic growth, other nations reduced poverty to a far greater extent. The difference, the studies say, is that other countries have more generous and effective social policies.
 
'Tolerating' More Poverty
 "It's simple: we choose to tolerate a lot more poverty than do other countries," said Timothy M. Smeeding, an economist at Syracuse University who wrote one of the studies.
Mr. Smeeding, who is drawing on previously unavailable data, argued that by adopting similar policies, the United States could make comparable inroads against poverty. Contending that the United States needs to spend more and design its programs better, he advocates a system of national health care, a program that guarantees child support for single parents and universal cash payments to families with children. He also calls for an expanded program of unemployment benefits and for more Government day care.
"I think it's hokum," said Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization.
 
Studies Termed Flawed
 Mr. Besharov said the studies had huge technical flaws that make their comparisons misleading. He said they compare the United States only with the most prosperous nations of Europe, conveniently omitting poverty-stricken areas like Romania and Bulgaria.
Above all, he contended that this country's highly unusual position as a nation of stunning ethnic diversity, constant immigration and loose social norms rendered European comparisons meaningless.
Mr. Besharov argued that America's high rates of poverty were more difficult to solve than Europe's because they involved the failure of some poor people to seek work. Providing increased benefits without imposing obligations to work or study might only worsen the problem, he said, by encouraging more dependency.
"Liberals always say, 'Gee, if we could only do it as well as the Europeans,' " he said. "But the problem is we don't have the same kind of poor people. Our problem is with poor people who don't work."
 
Legislation Is Considered
 The debate over the European experience comes as American poverty rates, stubbornly high even during a time of national prosperity, are once again on a recession-driven rise, and some lawmakers are urging variations of Western European solutions.
Among the European-style policies being considered by Congress are variations on a national system of health care, and proposals to provide cash allowances to families with children.
"The United States is the only Western industrialized nation without a child allowance policy," said Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, a West Virginia Democrat who is pushing such plans. "And it shows."
Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University, said the timing of these proposals was disturbing since they came as some Western European countries were cutting back, for fear that they were producing dependency. "In Europe, you're beginning to see an ethnically and behaviorally distinct underclass," he said.
Mr. Smeeding contended that in the mid-1980's, market forces alone produced a similar amount of poverty here and in the other countries he studied: Canada, Australia, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Britain.
But he said that huge differences emerge when Government programs are counted. Ambitious social programs in the other countries eliminated about three-quarters of their poverty, Mr. Smeeding said, but social policy in this country reduced poverty by only about one-third.
After Government programs are counted, the poverty rate of 10.9 percent for the American elderly was nearly four times the average rate in the other countries, he said. The poverty rate of 20.4 percent for American children was about three times as high.
Amid this debate, there is substantial agreement that economic growth alone is less of a prescription for fighting poverty than it used to be.
Liberals tend to emphasize changes in the economy that have depressed wages for the least-skilled workers. Conservatives emphasize the failure of many poor people to seek work.
In the second new study, comparing the two longest economic expansions in modern American history, Rebecca M. Blank, an economist at Northwestern University, documented the change in the ability of economic growth to reduce poverty.
During the longest expansion, from 1961 to 1970, the percentage of Americans living in poverty dropped 9.6 points, to 12.6 percent. During the second-longest expansion, from 1983 to 1989, the drop was slight by comparison, a 2.4-point dip to 12.8 percent.
Had the same correlation held true between economic growth and the reduction of poverty, Ms. Blank said, the 1989 poverty rate would have been 9.3 percent, meaning that 8.7 million fewer Americans would have lived in poverty.
"Trickle down did not work in the 1980's as well as it did in the 1960's," she said. Ms. Blank attributed the difference to a collapse in wages for the lowest-paid workers.
Comparing the United States with Canada, Ms. Blank found that similar economic trends held true in both countries for the past decade but that Canada's poverty rates fell much faster.
Examining data for 1986, Ms. Blank found that market forces alone left 17.5 percent of Canadians poor. But once welfare assistance and other Government programs were counted, the rate fell to 11.8 percent.
By contrast, the United States started out with less poverty but wound up with more: market forces produced a poverty rate of 15.5 percent, but Government programs cut that figure little, to 13.6 percent.
"The difference is almost entirely due to Canada's more generous public assistance program," she said.
Ms. Blank relied on the official American definition of poverty, which is based on a minimal food budget and is updated every year for inflation. In 1990, for example, a family of four was considered poor if it received less than $13,359. To arrive at the Canadian poverty figures, she simply converted the thresholds into Canadian currency.
 
Method of Study Attacked
 Some American conservatives are sharply critical of this method, saying it exaggerates the extent of American poverty since it does not count Government programs that provide noncash benefits like subsidized housing, food stamps and medical care.
Analyzing previously unavailable figures from Western Europe, Mr. Smeeding found similar patterns. He said other countries started with comparable or even higher amounts of poverty than the United States, but used policy much more effectively in reducing it.
On average in the mid-1980's, the economies of the countries he studied produced a poverty rate of 22.4 percent. But after social programs were counted, that figure fell to 5.9 percent.
The drop was much more modest in the United States, falling from 19.9 percent before Government assistance to 13.3 percent after it. Mr. Smeeding defined as poor any household receiving less than 40 percent of that nation's median income, a measure that he said approximated the United States standard. He did not count noncash benefits.
Mr. Besharov said Mr. Smeeding's definition of poverty was meaningless. Given differences in international standards of living, he said, someone defined as poor in America may in fact have more material goods than French or Swedes who are not considered poor.
Most of all, Mr. Besharov questioned the idea that European solutions could be imported without producing harmful side effects.
For instance, he contended that in most European countries there were strong social pressures for teen-agers not to have babies. He said European countries could therefore provide more money to single mothers, with fewer fears that they would increase teen-age pregnancy.
If the United States gave single young mothers more money, he argued, it might just get more single young mothers. "We are a much freer society," he said.
Mr. Smeeding argued that the differences between the societies was not as large as Mr. Besharov said and that policies should be modified for an American context.
"What he's saying is that all international comparisons are illegitimate," Mr. Smeeding said. "I just don't agree."

HEADLINE: BUSH RULING OUT TAX CUT FOR NOW

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
President Bush pledged today to fight "tooth and nail" to revive the nation's sluggish economy, but he indicated that he would not propose a tax cut at this time.
Mr. Bush accused the Democratic-controlled Congress of panicking with a welter of tax cut measures and suggested that he was not about to follow suit with hasty steps that he said could do more harm than good. 
 After meeting with the President, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who is the House Republican whip, told reporters, "There's no indication of being able to produce a package in the next couple weeks," with Congress scheduled to adjourn for the year on Nov. 22.
"If, on the other hand, Congress stays in during Thanksgiving, I think the President's pressure to get something passed would increase substantially," Mr. Gingrich said.
 
Meeting With G.O.P. Leaders
 Mr. Bush and Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, discussed the economy at a luncheon meeting with Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader; Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader; Mr. Gingrich, and Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming.. Although White House officials said earlier that the President would propose his own legislation in an effort to promote economic growth, Mr. Bush appeared to rule out such a course, both at the luncheon with Republican leaders and at a speech to a group of officials in the natural gas industry.
"I know there's a lot to be done," the President said in a teleconference with an American Gas Association convention in San Diego. "I'm not relaxed about the economy."
He blamed Congress for slowing the pace of economic recovery by ignoring his domestic proposals, measures that he contended would have helped create jobs. He mentioned legislation intended to promote highway and mass transit projects and to give tax breaks to businesses that locate in low-income urban areas.
But, referring to the tax cut bills on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush said: "I'm not going to jump in and take steps out of some Congressional panic that might make the situation worse. It might burden future generations more."
The President and other officials in his Administration have complained that many measures they consider to be economic stimulants, including a proposal to lower the rate on capital gains taxes, have been languishing on Capitol Hill for some time.
"Throughout the coming legislative year, we will fight tooth and nail for economic growth, opportunity and jobs, and I will fight against legislation that will bust the budget agreement and further burden the young people of this country with more and more debt, with bigger and bigger Federal deficits," Mr. Bush said.
Republican leaders said the President indicated he would redouble his efforts to get a trimmed-down bill passed to extend unemployment benefits.
His veto of a Democratic bill to extend the benefits for 20 weeks beyond the 26 weeks under existing law was sustained by a two-vote margin in the Senate. Democrats have accused the President of being indifferent to the plight of the unemployed.
Mr. Bush has said he favors a bill sponsored by Senator Dole that would extend the benefits for 10 weeks, but no vote has been scheduled on that bill.

HEADLINE: U.S. Agency Accused of Manipulating Crash Tests

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Two consumer groups today accused the Transportation Department of manipulating car crash tests and selectively making the results public to support the automobile industry's contention that stricter fuel economy standards would produce more dangerous cars.
In a caustic rejoinder, the head of the department's traffic safety agency dismissed the accusations, lending the debate over fuel efficiency and safety an increasingly bitter tone just as the Senate prepares to consider tougher standards for gas mileage. 
 The consumer groups, the Center for Auto Safety and Public Citizen, said that Jerry R. Curry, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, was seeking to influence Congress by frightening drivers when he ordered the agency to conduct tests and make a videotape that would demonstrate the safety of larger cars. The groups said Mr. Curry suppressed other tests that produced less dramatic results.
 
'No Creditability'
 Mr. Curry responded with an attack on Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety, whom he called "as nonobjective a person as you can get," and someone with "no creditability in the traffic safety community." But Mr. Curry avoided criticizing the head of Public Citizen, Joan Claybrook, who headed the traffic safety agency in the Carter Administration. The two groups have long been critical of the agency.
The safety agency's pictures of a head-on collision between a large and a small car have been widely shown in recent televised and printed advertisements sponsored by the automobile industry and its allies, who contend that requiring Detroit to build more efficient cars would compromise safety by putting smaller cars on the road.
The safety argument is at the heart of the debate over legislation that may come before the Senate this week, calling for a 40 percent increase in the average car's efficiency within 10 years.
Throughout the debate, the safety agency has contended that big gains in fuel economy would come mainly from making cars smaller and subjecting passengers to added risks in collisions and rollovers.
The agency meant to underscore that message with its videotape, which was issued last May with a letter emphasizing the dangers of small cars that might accompany new legislation.
But according to the consumer groups, the agency did not publicize other tests it had conducted that did not support the claim, at least not as vividly. Nor did it make public detailed test results showing that the driver of the smaller car in the video could have survived the impact, the groups said.
In some tests conducted by the agency, the occupants of smaller cars fared better than those in larger cars. That could be the case, for example, when testing pairs of medium-sized cars whose weights did not differ very much, or when the tests involved cars equipped with air bags or when a car skidded sideways into a utility pole.
"These tests do not clearly demonstrate the safety problems of small cars," said one Government memorandum describing some of the tests that the safety agency conducted. The memorandum and related test results were obtained by the consumer groups under a law governing the release of official documents.
The cars shown in the advertisement were selected by Mr. Curry from a list provided by his staff in a series of tests. The list included large, small and medium-sized cars, some of them equipped with air bags.
Mr. Curry selected the Ford Crown Victoria, a very large car, as one test vehicle, and arranged collisions with a pair of much smaller cars built by Suzuki and Subaru. The small cars weigh about half the large car, and get about twice as many miles per gallon.
The result of the crash was as spectacular as it was predictable. The big car plows through the front of the smaller one, tossing the car to one side.
Mr. Curry said that nothing in the testing program was deceptive, and he dismissed the suggestion by the consumer groups that by producing and disseminating the video the department had engaged in illegal lobbying.

HEADLINE: Salvadoran Foes Debating a New Police Force

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Political and military leaders and diplomats have begun to debate and study the creation of the broad-based national police force that is to be an important element in the Salvadoran peace accord, even while the guerrillas and armed forces attacked and taunted each other without letup in recent days.
Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas said in his Sunday homily that El Salvador was hearing "songs of peace," played to "music of war." 
 The guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front continued to sabotage economic infrastructure, including the bombing of two bridges on main highways in the eastern part of the country, further attacks on the electric power network and damage to thousands of coffee trees. The army continued to pursue the rebels in scattered combat operations across the mountains in the north and east of the country.
The Archbishop, while lamenting the guerrilla sabotage, said two civilians had also been found dead and appeared to be victims of right-wing death squads. He said these "old things" seriously threatened peace.
 
Criticism Exchanged
 The armed forces command criticized the guerrillas for inconveniencing civilians, and the guerrillas responded on their radio station by asserting that the "dogs of war" -- the army -- were not ready for a Christmas at peace after 12 years of war.
The guerrillas added that they were attacking civilian targets because the army had abandoned its responsibilities to guard the cities, highways and bridges in the populous areas of the country to mount operations in mountainous areas that the insurgents consider theirs.
Although the latest round of United Nations-sponsored negotiations, which ended last week in Mexico, did not produce dramatic results, both sides indicated that they still expect to agree on a cease-fire before the end of the year.
Under partial accords signed in New York last month, the new national police force is to replace three existing security forces -- the national guard, the national police and the treasury police -- and is to be open to former guerrillas as well as to those who fought for the Government, and to noncombatants.
This arrangement was agreed on as a means of guaranteeing to the guerrillas that their lives will be respected after a cease-fire and that other commitments made by the Government -- including electoral and judicial reforms and reduction and reform of the army -- will be kept.
 
Longstanding Demand Dropped
 In exchange, the guerrillas agreed to drop their longstanding demand to be incorporated into the army itself, or for the disbanding of the army.
Nevertheless, the organization and makeup of the new police force have set off sharp disputes in recent days among guerrilla field commanders, the Government, the army and opposition political parties.
The Government of President Alfredo Cristiani and the army leadership assert that the accords provide only for the guerrillas to be admitted to the future police academy without ideological prejudice, without guaranteeing the insurgents a leadership role.
But the guerrillas talk of moving into some command positions in the police as soon as the force is created. That was reinforced in the recent talks when a group of guerrilla field commanders left their mountain hideouts here and went to Mexico City for a meeting with the guerrilla leaders conducting the negotiations with the Government.
Gen. Orlando Zepeda, the Deputy Minister of Defense, asserted on Thursday that the guerrillas were expecting to take command of the new police posts in zones of the country where rebel forces consider themselves in control. He called that "offensive" and said hardly anyone in El Salvador was in agreement with such a move.
When some of the guerrilla field commanders who went to Mexico returned to their areas Friday, they told journalists that they were determined to see to it that "no one will be able to monopolize" the new police force.

HEADLINE: Irate Dinkins Defends Trip To Germany

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Bristling with indignation, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday defended his plan for an expenses-paid "working vacation" to a German tennis tournament in December, questioned the motives of his critics and insisted that whatever his popularity or problems at home, he still stood tall around the world.
Mr. Dinkins said that he had accepted the invitation to the Compaq Grand Slam Cup in Munich, Germany, at the behest of its German promoter because, "among other things, they're going to pay for it," and that he saw nothing wrong with taking free trips. He said that the promoter, Dr. Axel Meyer-Wolden, had no financial ties to the United States Tennis Association, which is seeking to expand its tennis center in Queens, and that the trip posed no conflict of interest.
 
'Best Interests of Our City'
 The Mayor said he also intended to visit the Dachau concentration camp and other historical sites to honor the memory of Holocaust victims and to court European businesses with a side trip to Berlin on what he said would be a three- to five-day visit, starting Dec. 10, just a month after his planned weeklong trip to South Africa. 
 The mayor is to be accompanied by his Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, his aides said. His side trip to Berlin would be financed by the New York City Alliance for International Business, a nonprofit group set up by the city to foster international business ties.
"I don't expect that I should get gold stars because I'm willing to make such a trip," he told reporters at City Hall. "But I certainly don't expect to be condemned for doing what I think is in the best interests of our city."
The Mayor said that if he went to "lie on a beach for four days," he would get no flak, and he professed confusion at why the trips had drawn scrutiny when other jaunts by his predecessors had not. "I'm not going to raise with you questions of how come people are asking me about this, when they didn't raise these questions heretofore.
"I wish I knew," he said.
Mr. Dinkins also took pains to tell the reporters how patient he believed he was in answering irritating or unfair questions. "I figure sooner or later you're going to give me a little credit for that. Sooner or later you're going to acknowledge what the facts are because you're going to have to look yourselves in the mirror. And sooner or later you're going to say, 'Damn, the guy does stand up and answer.' "

HEADLINE: Our Towns

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE, N.J.

 BODY:
Here's the scenario: A well-dressed lady who knows everything that's fit to print about the community leaves her car in the fading afternoon suburban sunshine. She walks toward the house along a leaf-strewn sidewalk, never cutting across the lawn. She approaches the door of the house on one of an endless number of streets lined with substantial private homes owned by hard-working professionals and their mortgage companies.
The woman rings the doorbell, then steps back to leave some nonthreatening distance in front of the door. She shifts the huge wicker basket with the pretty bow to her left hand to permit a handshake with these strangers. When the husband appears, the woman smiles broadly, introduces herself and is welcomed into the home just like that, without a badge or references. But first, she wipes her feet. 
 A dream? A reunion of the Donna Reed Show? Harriet Nelson seeking Ozzie? Nope. The Welcome Wagon lady has struck again.
It still happens thousands of times a day across the country, even in the crowded New York area where many people don't even notice their neighbors' departure, let alone their arrival.
For 63 years now, Welcome Wagon representatives have been calling on households for any number of reasons. The best-known excuse is the family's recent arrival from somewhere else (some frontier American towns used to dispatch welcome wagons to greet wandering pioneers, hoping they would choose to settle in their communities).
Welcome Wagon is, of course, still a privately held business. The Memphis headquarters charges a fee to every merchant recommended by its legions and then pays a percentage to the lady with the basket. But today, nearly half the average Welcome Wagon representative's calls are for other reasons: an engagement, a marriage, a new baby, a new business, a 50th anniversary. And that's not all that's changed.
Sigrid Novak has been smiling her way all over South Orange from doorbell button to doorbell button for nearly 10 years now. "It's fun," she says, "plain and simple."
When she began, every call was made in the daytime. Now, few are. With so many two-career families, virtually every call today is in the evening or on Saturday mornings. Families are more leery of strangers at the door now; they want an appointment and no unannounced drop-ins. Trouble is, to protect their privacy, many more families now have unlisted phone numbers.
So Mrs. Novak leaves her big cheery business card in the door asking them to call her for an appointment. Most do. With few local daytime contacts in the community, a family's only link to local services and activities is often Mrs. Novak.
Even when a recession trims the number of corporate moves, South Orange's Welcome Wagon lady keeps busy welcoming new professionals who may eventually add their free coupons and consultations to her basket. Mrs. Novak even works the Seton Hall University campus, calling on new employees. They may live in another town, her theory goes, but they spend their working day and lunch money in South Orange.
Altogether, she makes about 40 calls a month. Late the other afternoon she was prompt for her call on James and Rebecca Ries over on Warwick Avenue. Seven years ago, Mrs. Novak remembered, she welcomed these newcomers from Idaho. This time she welcomed the couple's two new adopted babies, Katherine and Dragos.
Her basket was specially equipped for the occasion. Mrs. Novak spent 75 minutes handing out refrigerator magnets and pens, booklets on cultural and municipal services and coupons for free baby portraits, a week's worth of cloth-diaper deliveries, free restaurant desserts, haircuts, make-overs, cable hookup and a mystery gift from a hardware store.
She naturally cooed over the 3-month-old babies. She recommended dentists and doctors with evening hours. She urged loyal patronage of local businesses and expounded on a variety of activities for children. When the trio discovered some mutual friends, they discussed them.
But when Mrs. Ries complained about crime -- "It seems to me these days you have the right to be shot in your driveway" -- Mrs. Novak suddenly discovered more items to pull from her basket. Before leaving, she handed the new parents a list of every business she had mentioned. Then, wishing them well and issuing compliments on the renovations since her first visit, Mrs. Novak was down the sidewalk, in the car, restocking her basket.
The visit was a little long because of the baby distractions, but otherwise a standard Welcome Wagon visit, she said. Right down to the VCR.
Like most of these ubiquitous machines that Mrs. Novak glimpses during her visits, it was flashing the wrong time, waiting for some teen-ager to re-program its memory without reading the directions.
Something else that never changes.

HEADLINE: The Hard Times Roll on Syracuse Campus

BYLINE: By SAMUEL WEISS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
By any measure, the 1980's were good to Syracuse University. Enrollment flourished, 10 new buildings were opened, the university upgraded many of its academic programs and its basketball and football teams became national powerhouses.
Syracuse seemed to be the academic equivalent of a bull market that had driven the bears into hibernation. But, like so many institutions and industries that flourished in the 1980's, it is now retrenching -- prompting a critical re-examination of the university's strengths and weaknesses that some Syracuse officials say is long overdue. 
 That re-examination, in response to falling enrollment, has already produced a budget cut that includes a salary freeze for all employees. It has also inspired studies that could lead to the elimination of major academic programs over the next several years.
"Ordinarily, there is a strong sense of inertia on university campuses, and Syracuse did not need to make hard choices in an expansionary period," said Dr. John Palmer, dean of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs here, adding that Syracuse, which has 16,500 students, is being forced "to take the kind of hard look at ourselves that all institutions of higher education should be doing."
Syracuse is far from the only university trying to make do with less these days.
Yale University's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., for example, has announced cuts of 5 to 10 percent for academic and administrative departments this year. At Stanford University, officials announced budget reductions ranging from 7 to 12 percent in its seven schools.
 
Fewer Undergraduates
 What Syracuse is feeling is similar to "grieving," said Dr. Kenneth A. Shaw, who became the Chancellor in August. The school has lost about 1,700 undergraduates in the last two years, the primary cause of a $9.5 million budget deficit for the fiscal years 1990-92. Undergraduate enrollment, now about 11,500 students, is expected to drop another 1,200 to 1,900 students over the next several years, translating into an additional budget deficit of $28.5 million in the next three years. .
To deal with those problems, Dr. Shaw is expected to announce in February a restructuring that could eliminate 500 to 600 people from the university's 4,000-member work force. An advisory group of administrators and faculty members has already suggested the elimination of some academic programs and the consolidation of some of the university's 14 schools and colleges.
Thomas F. Cummings Jr., vice president for enrollment management and continuing education at Syracuse, said enrollments at Syracuse and many other private schools where tuition has rapidly increased were being hurt by the recession's pinch on family incomes and stiffer competition among colleges and universities for the fewer students now available.
Demographers had projected in the early 1970's that the number of high school graduates, and thus potential college undergraduates, would drop beginning in the 1980's.
At Syracuse, enrollment actually rose. At the same time, fund raising hit an all-time high, construction boomed and the state built the 50,000-seat Carrier Dome.
"We knew we were running countertrend," Mr. Cummings said. "But all you can do is plan on the basis of the present, and all the elements were coming together in a positive way in the 1980's. We did not see any pattern suggesting an enrollment downturn."
 
A 'Pruning' Begun
 Now that the enrollment picture has changed, Syracuse has rejected the solutions of lowering admission standards to fill its classrooms or of using its cash reserves. Instead it has begun a "pruning" that officials say will ultimately make the institution stronger.
Dr. Richard E. Anderson, vice president for finance at Washington University, said that restructuring a major university was "much trickier" than reducing a big corporation. "In a business," Dr. Anderson said, "your inputs and outputs are all calculated in dollar terms. In a university, the inputs are calculated in dollars but the outputs have to be measured in educational value."
Decisions about which values to emphasize will fall largely on Dr. Shaw, who succeeded Dr. Melvin A. Eggers, who resigned as Chancellor after 20 years. Dr. Shaw, who is 52 years old, has tried to relieve some of the anxiety over proposed cuts by opening up the discussion.
"Ever since the announcement, students have been worried about how much of a say they are going to have in all this," said Jodi Lamagna, editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Orange. "So far, the Chancellor has shown real concern for our input."
Prof. Michael A. Sickler, chairman of the local chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said that even though faculty members are being consulted, there is still some "mild hysteria" about the results.
"If you are a member of a school not in high demand by students," he said, "the question is, will your program be closed, or will it be melded with another program with a different set of priorities, curriculum and personnel practices? The concern is particularly acute among the nontenured faculty members hoping to have a future here."
Dr. Shaw, who came to Syracuse from the University of Wisconsin, where he was president for four years, said in an interview that he would be guided by three principles in evaluating the academic programs: educational quality, the "centrality" of a program to the university's basic objectives and student demand. Dr. Shaw said one consequence of restructuring would probably be to reduce some of the university's 77 doctoral programs and some research work as well.
Syracuse has 14 different schools and colleges, and while some units like the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs and the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communication are believed to be likely to be left unscathed because of their academic stature and popularity among students, some may not.
 
Consolidations Proposed
 An advisory committee to the Chancellor suggested last month that some schools with declining enrollments be looked at as candidates for consolidation. One suggestion called for combining the schools of education, human development, nursing and social work. Another called for the consolidation of the School of Information Studies with the School of Management.
Dr. Shaw refused to say which, if any, of these ideas he might seek to implement. But on one thing he was definite: Neither the university's football team, which has made four bowl appearances in the last decade, nor its basketball team, which came within a hair of winning the national championship in 1987, would be harmed.
"Why should they?" Dr. Shaw asked. "They make money."

HEADLINE: Suits Force U.S. and States To Pay More for Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Hospitals and nursing homes around the country are successfully suing states to force them to increase Medicaid payments to levels that more nearly reflect what it costs to treat patients.
The multimillion-dollar judgments, propelled by a 1990 Supreme Court decision permitting such suits, are severely straining the budgets of the Federal and state governments, which jointly finance the program to provide medical care to low-income people. 
 In state after state, from New York to Indiana to Washington, judges are finding that Medicaid payments to health-care providers do not meet the standard of "reasonable and adequate" compensation under the law. Instead of reimbursing hospitals and nursing homes based on the costs incurred by efficient health-care providers, states often base their payments simply on budget considerations, the courts say.
 
78 Cents on the Dollar
 According to a survey of hospitals by the American Hospital Association, on average, hospitals receive 78 cents for every dollar it costs to care for Medicaid patients. Judges in several cases have reached similar conclusions.
Federal and state spending for Medicaid has increased by several billion dollars a year as a result of court judgments, settlements and rate increases granted by states anticipating lawsuits.
Costs have been estimated at $62 million in Washington State, $120 million in Virginia, $65 million in Oregon and $90 million in Michigan. One institution that serves many poor people in Philadelphia, Temple University Hospital, is getting an increase of $13 million a year, or 34 percent, in its Medicaid revenue as a result of its lawsuit against Pennsylvania.
State officials around the country say the Medicaid increases come at a time when they are cutting other programs and raising taxes to eliminate budget deficits. Michael H. Hershock, the Budget Secretary of Pennsylvania, said "there just isn't enough money in our tax base to pay" all the rate increases required by Federal court decisions.
Even as lawsuits are forcing increases in Federal and state Medicaid spending, they could mean lower charges for some consumers. By forcing states to raise their Medicaid payments, the lawsuits could slow the increase in charges for people with private health insurance. Currently, hospitals increase charges to people with private health insurance, in a practice known as "cost-shifting," to make up for underpayments by Medicaid.
If the court judgments reverse that trend, "that is going to displease state budget directors, but it will probably please consumers and corporate benefits managers who pay for insurance," said Prof. Mark V. Pauly, a health economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
But health-care experts warn that to offset the costs of complying with court orders, some states might restrict Medicaid eligibility or cut back on optional services rather than increase taxes or shift money from other programs.
Fredric J. Entin, senior vice president and general counsel of the American Hospital Association, said the lawsuits were a partial solution. They curb "the more egregious and transparent attempts" by states to slow the growth of Medicaid by underpaying hospitals and nursing homes, he said.
Medicaid provides health care to 27 million Americans. It pays for the delivery of more than one-third of the babies born in the United States, and it helps finance care for more than two-thirds of all nursing home residents.
 
Rate-Setting on the Bench
 In theory, states still set Medicaid payment rates, commonly paying flat amounts for each patient, depending on the diagnosis. But Jeff E. Harris, senior research analyst at the Medicaid Management Institute, a project of the American Public Welfare Association, said, "The days of judicial rate-setting have begun."
Hospitals have filed lawsuits in 21 states. Nursing homes have brought court challenges in 20 states. Some of the suits were filed before the Supreme Court decision in June 1990, which increased the likelihood of success for hospitals and nursing homes.
The Federal Medicaid law says payments to hospitals and nursing homes must be "reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities." In addition, it says, Medicaid must pay enough to insure that poor people have "reasonable access" to hospital care.
In June 1990 the Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that hospitals and nursing homes were "intended beneficiaries" of the Medicaid law and could sue states to enforce their right to "reasonable and adequate" reimbursement.
 
Millions in Settlement
 When Federal or state judges scrutinize rates, they almost invariably find that Medicaid pays less than the costs incurred by efficiently operated hospitals and nursing homes. The judges often find that state decisions on reimbursement were made strictly for budgetary reasons, to save money, without considering the costs of care.
In Indiana, a state court ruled last month that the state had illegally and systematically underpaid nursing homes, with the result that the "quality of Medicaid patient care is declining due to inadequate rates."
Indiana nursing homes expect to win more than $120 million as a result of that decision. Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat, has denounced the court-ordered payment as "a raid upon the taxpayers' pockets" and has vowed to appeal the decision, saying it would enrich the owners of nursing homes without improving patient care.
In Washington State, a Federal district judge ruled in July that state officials had violated the Federal Medicaid law by setting hospital rates substantially below the amounts needed for "reasonable and adequate" compensation. Hospitals there will get an increase of about 10 percent, or $62 million over the next two years.
Last year's Supreme Court decision came in a case brought by the Virginia Hospital Association. The Court said health-care providers could use a Reconstruction-era statute to enforce their right to adequate Medicaid payments. The measure, originally passed in the 1870's to protect former slaves, permits lawsuits against state officials for violations of "any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United States.
In Virginia, after the Court decision, 91 hospitals negotiated a settlement under which they will get rate increases totaling $120 million over four years.
Laurens Sartoris, president of the Virginia Hospital Association, said, "Even with the settlement, all our hospitals will still be paid less than the cost of providing care to Medicaid recipients." But he said the additional payments were as generous as could be expected, given the state's fiscal problems.
The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, has ruled that Colorado violated the law by arbitrarily reducing Medicaid payments to hospitals by 46 percent.
As a result, it said, "no Colorado hospital, no matter how efficiently and economically operated, is reasonably and adequately reimbursed."
While the Federal Department of Health and Human Services is supposed to review state Medicaid payment rates, the court said such review was "cursory at best."
In New York, a Federal district judge ruled in July that the state had to increase Medicaid payments to the Rye Psychiatric Hospital Center. Frederick A. Nicoll, a lawyer for the hospital, said it now receives $423 a day for each Medicaid patient, as against $233 in the past.
Federal District Judge Gerard L. Goettel, who sits in White Plains, ruled that New York had violated the Federal Medicaid law by reducing its rates for private psychiatric hospitals without any formal findings that its payments would be adequate.
In Washington State, Federal district Judge Thomas S. Zilly ruled that state officials had violated the Medicaid law by setting hospital rates substantially below those needed for "reasonable and adequate" compensation. The state negotiated a settlement under which hospitals are to receive $62 million extra over the next two years, representing an increase of about 10 percent.
 
State 'Completely Failed'
 Oregon recently agreed to settle a similar lawsuit by increasing payments to its hospitals by $65 million, or about 30 percent, over two years.
In Michigan, Federal District Judge Robert Holmes Bell concluded that the state had "completely failed to meet the requirements" of the Federal Medicaid law and had "no idea" whether its Medicaid payments were adequate.
In February, Judge Bell approved a settlement expected to increase state Medicaid payments to hospitals by $70 million a year, or 17 percent.
In a separate lawsuit, nursing homes in Michigan won rate increases of about 10 percent, or $20 million to $25 million a year.
In Pennsylvania, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the state had violated the Federal Medicaid law by setting hospital payments without any analysis of their adequacy. The ruling insures higher Medicaid payments for more than 140 hospitals.

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Congress Hears From Artists

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Kathleen Turner, Alec Baldwin, Eric Bogosian and Chuck Close led a roster of 17 artists and arts administrators who testified yesterday at the Brooklyn Museum against stronger anti-obscenity restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts.
"Artists cannot create within a prison of vague threats, wondering what is decent, what is acceptable," Ms. Turner told a Congressional subcommittee; the actress expressed a view that was to be repeated by others throughout the day. 
 On Thursday last week, the House of Representatives narrowly supported a measure to drop anti-obscenity language inspired by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, in exchange for maintaining grazing subsidies for Western ranchers. The measure has become known as "corn for porn."
Mr. Close, the painter, said yesterday that although he had gratefully received a grant from the Federal agency in 1973 and served on a grant-making peer panel in 1982, he would refuse to join a panel today if asked to evaluate applications "on the basis of what Senator Helms considers indecent."
The Senate, which in September voted 68 to 28 to support Senator Helms's measure to prohibit the arts endowment from subsidizing "patently offensive" art exhibits and theatrical presentations, is expected to take final action on the House-Senate conference committee report this week.
The hearing at the Brooklyn Museum was run by Representative Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who is the chairwoman of a House subcommittee of the Committe on Government Operations. It will prepare a report on the National Endowment for the Arts.
"The far right has set its sights on American culture," Ms. Boxer said as she opened the four-hour hearing. "The politics of hate and fear must be challenged."
 
McCarthy Is Invoked
 Mr. Baldwin, the actor, said that Senator Helms was "attempting to get a choke hold on artistic expression," much as Sen. Joseph McCarthy did a generation ago.
Mr. Bogosian, the actor and monologuist, brought laughter from an audience of 100 in the museum's Cantor Auditorium when he said, "To put restrictions on art is like endowing a football team but refusing to let them wear helmets or cleats."
He was applauded after saying: "When a Congressman makes a decision about obscenity, the Congressman becomes a collaborator with the artist, and for me to collaborate with Senator Helms is obscene."
Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Economic Development Corporation of New York City, predicted that the hostility of Congress would be a major factor leading to the demise of many cultural institutions in the country by the end of the century.
Robert T. Buck, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, showed slides from an exhibition called "The Play of the Unmentionable" presented by the museum last year. It included much nudity and political comment, including letters of warning to German artists from Nazi officers in the 1930's.
"Everything in the show," Mr. Buck said, "was drawn from the museum's permanent collection. We wanted this exhibition to demonstrate that museums across this land are filled with works that would not pass muster under the standards now being discussed in Washington."

BATMAN'S youthful imitators may forever try to terrorize those who refuse them Halloween treats. But real bats are not the aggressive, dirty or dangerous creatures of lore. They are, in fact, industrious and invaluable assets to people and the planet. And they are succumbing worldwide at a frightening rate to human ignorance, greed and destruction.
In misguided efforts to protect people, crops and livestock, bats are being poisoned, blasted with dynamite, asphyxiated by burning tires or entombed alive by the millions in caves and mines where they seek a day's or a winter's rest. Many others are felled by hunters or die when spelunkers disturb their dwellings. 
 "Bats are disappearing at a faster rate than any other group of vertebrates," said Dr. Merlin Tuttle, a real-life "batman" who has spearheaded international efforts to save the versatile and vital animals.
As scientists learn more about bats, they are discovering how vital they are to hundreds of environmentally and economically important plants and trees, including major features of the tropical rain forest, African savannah and American desert. And the demise of insect-eating bats has permitted a population explosion among insects that pester people and devour crops.
Bats, the only mammals that can fly, account for nearly a quarter of all known species of mammals. But 40 percent of bat species are listed as endangered or threatened. Several of the nearly 1,000 species have become extinct within the last two decades, some disappearing before scientists could determine their precise role in the chain of life.
Yet conservation organizations, conscious of the creature's charmless image, are loath to intervene.
"When I first approached major conservation organizations 10 years ago, they wouldn't touch bats with a 10-foot pole," said the 50-year-old Dr. Tuttle, who since his high school days has been one of the furry animal's staunchest advocates. "They either didn't understand bats or viewed them as so unpopular as not to be worth the effort."
So Dr. Tuttle, then curator of mammals at the Milwaukee Public Museum, took bats literally and figuratively into his own hands. In 1982 he founded Bat Conservation International to sponsor research and educational programs about bats and their vital roles. Four years later, he left his museum job and moved the fledging organization to Austin, Tex., a state that has the most bat species -- 32 of the nation's 42 kinds of bats -- as well as the world's largest remaining bat colony in Bracken Cave in central Texas, where 20 million Mexican free-tail bats congregate.
Since then, Bat Conservation International has far surpassed its founder's dreams. Having arrived in Austin in 1986 with two employees and a few hundred members, it now boasts 17 full-time staff members and 12,500 members from 55 countries. Dr. Tuttle is the subject of a new biography for young people, "Batman: Exploring the World of Bats" by Laurence Pringle (MacMillan, $13.95), and his own book, "America's Neighborhood Bats" (hardcover, $19.95, and paperback, $9.95), is the University of Texas Press's best-selling volume.
A cartoon by W. Miller in the current issue of The New Yorker is further testimony to Dr. Tuttle's mushrooming success. One of a group of bats hanging in a cave says to a roost-mate: "We're starting to get media coverage. Pass it on."
As bats decline drastically throughout the world, scientists are scrambling to understand more about their unique biology, their critical ecological roles and their basic survival needs. At the 21st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research in Austin this month, some 300 scientists gathered to exchange new findings and suggest ways of rescuing bats from their only serious natural enemy: people.
At one time, bats were vulnerable only during their nightly feeding frenzy and only to predators like owls with limited appetites. Now people attack them during the day in caves, trees and abandoned mines and under bridges and eaves. Bats are especially vulnerable to mass annihilation because most species congregate in huge groups when not eating.
Chased from most of their traditional roosts in caves, they moved into abandoned mines. Now thousands of mines are being sealed to prevent injury to curious people, and other mines are being reactivated or used for other purposes. In Wisconsin, for example, where 95 percent of the state's bats hibernate in old mines, Dr. Tuttle rescued hundreds of thousands of insect-eating bats by staying the hand of a landowner who was going to fumigate them so he could use the shaft to store cheese.
In tropical Central and South America where the three species of blood-sipping vampire bats do an estimated $50 million worth of damage to livestock, ranchers who cannot tell one bat from another have destroyed millions of fruit-eating and insect-eating bats. Vampire bats, which roost in small groups, are far harder to find than the millions of insect-eaters that gather in caves, where they can be smoked out by burning tires.
 
Reapers and Sowers
For Many Plants, Bats Mean Life
 The critically important fruit-eating bats, however, have not fared well at human hands. In Southeast Asia, for example, giant fruit-eating bats known as flying foxes are routinely hunted for food and export, commanding as much as $20 apiece from wealthy islanders who consider them a gourmet treat. These huge bats, weighing as much as a pound and with wingspans of up to six feet, are easy targets for shotguns while they hang by the hundreds from treetops. Dr. Tuttle said that one of the Philippines' flying foxes, first discovered by scientists in the 1960's, was extinct by the 1980's.
Some 250 species of bats pollinate or disperse the seeds of hundreds of trees and shrubs, including those that bear economically important products like bananas, avocados, vanilla beans, dates, peaches, figs, cashews and agaves, the source of tequila. In a single night, one short-tailed fruit bat can disperse as many as 60,000 rain forest seeds.
A recent study by Bat Conservation International documented that more than 300 plant species in the Old World tropics alone rely on bats. These plants are the source of more than 450 commercial products, including medicines, timber, ornamentals, fiber and cordage and dyes and tannins, as well as foods and drinks.
In Africa, fast-declining flying foxes are the only known seed dispersers for the iroko tree, the source of millions of dollars worth of timber annually. The giant baobab tree, an ecologically critical feature of East African savannas, depends on bats to pollinate its flowers, which open only at night. The fruit bats of West Africa disperse nearly all the seeds of "pioneer plants" that start forests growing again on cleared land.
To Donald W. Thomas, an ecologist at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, fruit bats are "the keystone species on many tropical islands," where they are the sole pollinators and seed dispersers of long-lived rain forest trees.
In studies in the Ivory Coast, Dr. Thomas showed that when the seeds of tropical fruits pass through the digestive tract of fruit bats, they nearly always germinate, but those seeds that simply fall to the ground from the trees mostly do not. Furthermore, he found by studying bat droppings that the animals dispersed most of the seeds far from the mother tree, which greatly enhanced a seedling's chances of taking hold.
Migrating nectar-eating bats from Mexico were recently shown to be a key to the survival of the giant cactus and agaves that are the distinguishing features of the Sonoran Desert. Dr. Theodore H. Fleming and colleagues from the University of Miami at Coral Gables found that lesser long-nosed bats, a federally listed endangered species, follow "nectar corridors" -- a succession of blooming organ-pipe and saguaro cacti -- as they head north into Arizona in spring and then follow a reverse succession of blooming agaves when they head south to Mexico in late fall.
With each foray into the nectar trough of a desert flower, the long-nosed bat emerges covered with pollen, which is deposited at the bat's next stop. Without these long-nosed bats, which are ideally constructed for their job as pollinators, the giant cactus and agave could die out.
 
Natural Pest Control
Sonar Serves Up Feast of Insects
 Bats that eat insects find their night's meal by emitting high frequency sounds and locating targets by the returning echoes. All six species of bats that live in and around New York City are insect-eating "microbats," some of which consume up to 3,000 insects a night. Although all can see, their sonar tells far more than eyes can about a potential meal on the wing in the dark.
The high-frequency sounds bats emit and the echoes they process give these voracious hunters detailed information about the movement, distance, speed, trajectory, size and shape of possible prey. Bat sonar can detect an object as thin as a human hair and only eight-hundredths of an inch long.
Dr. Nobuo Suga, a biologist at Washington University in St. Louis, studies electrical impulses generated by individual neurons in the auditory center of the pearl-sized brain of the mustached bat. He has determined that by using pulses with different frequencies the animal derives very precise details about a potential meal. He also found that the bats use harmonics to avoid collisions with other bats while hunting in dense packs.
Dr. Tuttle noted that a half million pounds of insects typically succumb each night to large foraging colonies of insectivorous bats. The million or so Mexican free-tail bats that roost under the Congress Avenue Bridge in downtown Austin eat 14 tons of insects a night from March to November, said Dr. Tuttle, who convinced the city not to destroy them but instead to turn the bat colony's nightly emergence into a tourist attraction.
Dr. James H. Fullard, a zoologist at the University of Toronto, noted that before bats evolved more than 60 million years ago, moths and other nocturnal insects owned the night sky, flitting about unmolested by predators. The appearance of bats forced them to evolve a novel anti-bat strategy -- a way of hearing the echolocating calls of hunting bats, in effect a radar detector. Moths with this strategic advantage are 40 percent less likely to be eaten, Dr. Fullard said. When they hear a bat speed up its sonar beam, indicating that it has begun its final approach, the moths launch into a wild acrobatic act, looping up, down and around to evade the less agile bat. If that is not enough, the moths fold their wings and dive to the ground where the bat is hard put to find them.
Other moths emit their own sonar signal, blasting out high-pitched clicks that startle the bat. Still others use an auditory guise to dissuade bats by mimicking a sound produced by a foul-tasting moth.
But some tropical bats are like Stealth fighters, acoustically invisible to moths. They emit echolocation calls "so high-pitched that even the sensitive ears of moths cannot detect them," Dr. Fullard said.
Dr. Paul A. Faure, a biologist at Cornell University, has studied these "whispering" bats, which forage among vegetation rather than in the air. By implanting electrodes into the auditory nerves of the moths, he showed that the insects were deaf to the bats' high-pitched emissions.
Others hunt without making any noise at all. Dr. Z. M. Fusessery of the University of Wyoming reported that pallid bats are silent hunters. The enormous ears and finely tuned auditory systems of these bats are so sensitive they can hear an insect as it walks and detect the wing flutter of a moth about to take off.
Frog-eating bats have evolved yet another strategy, Dr. Tuttle found. They simply tune into the frog's mating call and silently pick off the amorous amphibian.
 
Rescuing Bats
Charting Paths To Survival
 The extraordinary vulnerability of animals that congregate by the millions in a few well-defined locations demands fast action from those trying to spare the woodsman's ax. Kirk W. Navo of the Colorado Division of Wildlife, who reported that "about 2,000 of the mines in Colorado have already been sealed without any input from wildlife experts," said he and his colleagues have recruited and trained dozens of volunteers to survey mine sites for bat life. Armed with bat detectors that pick up the animals' sonar, the volunteers work night shifts to monitor bat activity before the mines are closed. But with more than 20,000 inactive mines in the state, the volunteers are hard put to keep up with closings.
Two years ago, Dr. Tuttle said, one of the largest remaining bat populations in New Jersey, a hibernating hoard of 20,000 little brown bats, was sealed into a rural mine. A member of Bat Conservation International noticed the closing and called headquarters, which got the mine reopened in a few days. The mine and its surroundings have since been made a protected reserve for bats.
"Bat gates," vandal-proof metal grids that allow access to bats but not people, are increasingly being used to protect caves and mines that are major bat roosts and hibernation sites. Dr. Tuttle explained that each time human visitors arouse a hibernating bat, it uses up 10 to 30 days' food supply. More than a few arousals a winter can easily result in an entire colony starving to death before insects reappear in spring.
Dr. Elizabeth D. Pierson, a bat researcher from Berkeley, Calif., reported the successful relocation of a bat colony by the Homestake Mining Company, which was planning to reactivate an area containing a bat-occupied mine. After the colony emerged at night, the mine shaft was sealed and the colony moved into another mine nearby that was protected by a bat gate.
Finally, Tracey Tarlton of Bat Conservation International has been analyzing bridges to uncover design features that make ideal bat roosts. Instead of killing off bridge-inhabiting bat colonies "because bridge workers are afraid of them," she proposed structural features for bridges and overpasses that could provide safe haven for these valuable animals.

These bats follow "nectar corridors" during their migration, pollinating saguaros on their way north across the Sonoran Desert in the spring and the agaves as they head south to Mexico in the fall.; Bats have an undeserved reputation for being aggressive and dangerous. Misguided efforts to protect people, crops and livestock are threatening many species' existence. Bats are industrious and invaluable insect predators.

Diagram: "Sonic Wars Between Bat And Moth"
 Using sonar, a big brown bat can calculate the speed, elevation and size of a moth from the time between the bat's sound pulse and the echo. Some bats can discriminate a difference in echo delay of 69 to 98 millionths of a second.

Diagram: "Bat Jamming"
 In a remarkable example of predator-prey co-evolution, some moths have an anti-bat device, tiny receivers of one to four nerve cells tuned to the frequency of bat calls. Some moths can hear the sonar calls of the big brown bat when it is almost 100 feet away. Certain moths blast back their own sounds, thought to be attempts to confuse the bat.
Upon detecting the rapid increase in sonar pulses that a bat locking onto its prey produces, a moth makes a sudden change in its flight path, taking abrupt loops and vertical dives into the vegetation.

HEADLINE: Modern Alchemists Transmute Nuclear Waste

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
RENAISSANCE alchemists sought in vain for a way to transmute base metals into gold, but modern nuclear alchemists believe they have hit upon an even more valuable discovery: a means of transmuting America's deadly mountain of long-lived radioactive waste into substances that lose their radioactive sting relatively quickly.
New transmutation processes under study at a half dozen major American laboratories, and at institutions in the Soviet Union, Japan, France and Britain, can treat waste that would otherwise remain dangerously radioactive for up to 10 million years. 
 The waste, which is piling up in temporary storage sites around the nation while plans are made for permanent disposal, would be bombarded by nuclear particles and changed into substances that would be relatively safe in 300 years.
The plants that would carry out transmutation and processing of radioactive waste in the United States would be costly; experts said in interviews that it would cost $10 billion to $20 billion to create the kind of nuclear reprocessing capacity in the United States that several countries, notably France, have already built. Reprocessing is also mired in debate; some experts argue that high-level nuclear waste should be processed before deep permanent burial, while others maintain that such schemes create new problems, including the proliferation of plutonium that might be stolen by nuclear terrorists, and would merely delay the inevitable and urgent permanent burial.
Some nuclear officials argue that talk of transmutation will further delay permanent disposal. By raising the hope that transmutation might eliminate the need for permanent underground storage, political and legal moves to block the use of waste sites in New Mexico and Nevada gain support, thereby stalling action by the Department of Energy to bury the waste.
But scientific experts are in striking agreement that in principle, at least, transmutation will work. They disagree as to how best to carry it out, whether by using a new type of "Integral Fast Reactor" developed at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, or powerful particle accelerators.
 Transmutation requires a particle accelerator, a reactor, or both, to bombard nuclear waste with neutrons. This forces the long-lived radioactive atoms to undergo fission, thereby producing the lighter atomic variants known as isotopes that rapidly decay to relatively harmless materials. At various stages in the process, chemical processing is used to separate components of the waste -- recovering some valuable materials and plutonium reactor fuel, sending dangerous substances back for further processing and passing on the relatively safe remainder for permanent burial.
Radioactive waste from nuclear reactors that have produced electricity and nuclear explosives since the 1940's continues to accumulate in temporary storage sites that many experts regard as menaces. Some 30 percent of this spent reactor fuel was produced by weapons programs and the rest by commercial power reactors, said a spokesman for the Department of Energy. The United States has resolved to use storage caverns in supposedly impermeable geologic formations far beneath the ground.
But even if the Energy Department surmounts political and legal hurdles that still bar the use of such permanent burial sites as the planned excavation under Yucca Moutain, Nev., scientists say that a site of this size would fill up in 30 years at the present rate of waste production. Moreover, the rate may increase. Since the 1970's no new nuclear power plants have been ordered by United States utilities, but some energy experts believe this hiatus may soon end.
The construction of new reactors of the kind most widely used in America, "light water" reactors, would add to the flow of high-level radioactive waste.
Proponents of transmutation say it would not only reduce the volume of waste requiring burial, but would greatly reduce the time such waste would remain dangerous. Transmutation, they say, can transform waste that would otherwise remain dangerous for up to 10 million years into waste that would become no more dangerous than natural uranium ore in as little as 300 years. It is much easier to insure the safety of an underground storage system, they point out, if its contents remain dangerous for only a few decades -- or even a few centuries -- rather than for a period longer than mankind's existence. All the proposed transmutation schemes share another advantage: they would produce electric power that would partly defray their operating costs.
The various transmutation methods under consideration, which involve complex chemical processing as well as bombardment of radioactive waste with neutrons, are promising enough that the Department of Energy last month commissioned a study by the National Academy of Sciences and Engineering. The panel will report its conclusions in about two years.
Two federally supported laboratories, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, have proposed different types of particle accelerators for the job; a third, Argonne, is working on a new type of reactor that would simultaneously consume dangerous waste while producing electric power.
Dr. William H. Hannum, a research director at Argonne, says that the laboratory's planned Integral Fast Reactor would not only consume dangerous nuclear waste, but would produce plutonium fuel that could be safely and securely processed at or near the reactor plant. Although such a reactor resembles the "breeder" type used in this country to manufacture plutonium for nuclear warheads, the variant designed by Argonne would produce a mixture of plutonium and other materials that would be very difficult to convert into explosives.
Breeder-type power reactors were abandoned in the United States because of fears that nuclear explosives they produce could fall into terrorist hands. But for lack of breeder reactors to consume the waste from conventional uranium reactors, the United States has been forced to stockpile vast amounts of dangerous waste. If the Argonne design was adopted for future reactors, the rate of growth of waste would fall dramatically, proponents say. If America was supplied with such reactors, supplies of uranium fuel needed by conventional reactors could be made to last 100 times as long.
Critics of the Argonne reactor and of all transmutation schemes argue that they could create as many problems as they solve. Dr. Thomas H. Pigford, a nuclear engineer at the University of California in Berkeley and a member of the new academy panel, believes that the electric power industry is not willing to build reactors that would burn their own waste or existing stockpiles of nuclear waste. "To gain acceptance by the utility industry, new reactors must be more economical to run than conventional light-water reactors," he said. "And that simply won't be the case."
 
The Pressure of Protest
 Los Alamos already possesses an accelerator that scientists consider particularly suitable for transmuting radioactive waste. Protons from the accelerator would crash into a lead target, which would spew a dense shower of neutrons in all directions. Some of the neutrons from such a device hit the nuclei of dangerous atoms in the waste, making these atoms unstable and forcing them to split into safe substances or radioactive atoms with short half-lives. The half-life of a radioactive material is the period in which half of it will decay into other atomic forms. Longevity is measured in half lives, because a given amount of a radioactive substance will never completely decay.
Dr. Edward D. Arthur, the program manager at Los Alamos, said in an interview that transmutation of nuclear waste has been suggested from time to time in the last 20 years, but that neither funds nor adequate equipment were available. Now, however, two factors are prompting renewed study. The first is mounting public and political opposition to underground waste disposal at both a test site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., and the permanent site selected under Yucca Mountain, Nev. Some scientists and officials believe this would wane if the public could be assured that the waste would become relatively safe after some reasonable period of time.
A second reason for renewed interest in transmutation at Los Alamos, Dr. Arthur said, is the availability of a powerful linear accelerator, built for the "Star Wars" anti-missile research program, that could be used for rapid transmutation.
Dr. Gregory J. Van Tuyle, who heads Brookhaven's transmutation study, said that although spent reactor fuel contains many dangerous isotopes, only a few have half-lives long enough to cause problems when buried for thousands of years. One of these is plutonium, a byproduct of reactor operation and the metal that fuels nuclear explosions. Plutonium is extremely poisonous and has a half-life of 24,000 years.
Efficient chemical methods already exist for separating plutonium from the waste, along with three other man-made radioactive elements -- neptunium, americium and curium, all of which could be used to help fuel a transmutation system Brookhaven has dubbed "Phoenix." Four other reactor byproducts have top priority for elimination from stored waste. Two of these, strontium-90 and cesium-137, have half-lives of only about 30 years, but are so radioactive they cause heating problems in storage, and must therefore be removed. Two others, technetium-99 and iodine-129, have half-lives of 21,300 years and 16 million years, respectively, however, and could easily outlast the seals designed to confine them safely.
Both iodine-129 and technetium-99 are good candidates for transmutation. When iodine-129 is placed in an intense neutron beam and is hit by a low-energy neutron, it becomes iodine-130. This isotope decays in less than one day to xenon gas, which undergoes further transmutation to become a harmless xenon isotope. Bombarded by neutrons, technetium-99 is similarly transmuted to a non-radioactive form of ruthenium.
 
A Major Safety Feature
 In Brookhaven's Phoenix scheme, a high-energy particle accelerator, which has yet to be built, would send a beam of neutrons into an array of large cells containing some 2,500 tons of waste. This array would hold a "subcritical mass" of fissionable material; that is, it would be incapable of spontaneously generating enough neutrons to start or maintain a nuclear chain reaction.
A beam of neutrons from the accelerator shot into the waste could make up this deficit, however, and a chain reaction would then begin to "burn" the dangerous radioactive material into shorter-lived isotopes. After supplying its own needs, this "subcritical reactor" would produce 850 megawatts of electric power -- an output comparable to that of the abandoned Shoreham nuclear plant built by the Long Island Lighting Company.
A major safety feature of both the Brookhaven Phoenix and its somewhat similar Los Alamos counterpart would be "subcriticality"; a chain reaction could never get out of control because the instant the accelerator sustaining it shut down, the nuclear reaction would stop.
A variant of this approach, called CURE (for Clean Use of Reactor Energy), has been proposed by the Westinghouse Hanford Company, operator of the Department of Energy Hanford Site at Richland, Wash. A recent Hanford report concluded that "destruction of the bulk of the long-lived radioactivity rather than geological disposal would greatly reduce uncertainties in the long-term performance assessment."
An important part of all schemes for processing nuclear waste is chemical separation of the various types of elements in the mixture. The best known of these systems, called the Purex (for plutonium-uranium-extraction) method, has been used for decades by many nations to separate plutonium from other reactor products. Most of this plutonium has been used to make nuclear warheads, but some has been used as fuel for a type of power reactor some experts predict will eventually replace conventional uranium-fueled reactors.
A newer chemical separation system, called the Truex (for trans-uranic extraction) process, uses the waste from the Purex process to extract residual plutonium, uranium, neptunium, curium and technetium -- all of them dangerous. Once isolated from the nuclear waste produced by Purex, these substances could be conveniently targeted for transformation by neutron bombardment, or even used as fuels in subcritical accelerator-driven reactors.
Are any of these ideas practical? Replies vary according to points of view.
Dr. Clyde Frank, director of environmental and waste management for the Department of Energy, opposes anything likely to delay permanent underground storage of high-level radioactive waste. "Transmutation may be feasible for part of the waste," he said, "but if the necessary chemical processing ends up increasing the overall volume of waste by tenfold, where's the point?"
Dr. Van Tuyle of Brookhaven and other proponents of nuclear waste treatment see the issue differently. "Transmutation is practical. No one really disputes that," he said. "Of course there are difficulties in applying it to a full-scale operation. But the problem of high-level radioactive waste won't go away. We are obliged to find and implement long-term solutions. We have to think of our remote descendants as well as our children and grandchildren."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Now Sees A 'Sluggish' Economy

 BODY:
In his gloomiest assessment since last winter, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said yesterday that the nation's economy had taken a turn for the worse. The economy is still slightly, he told a group of business executives, but "in recent weeks, it's turned demonstrably sluggish."
 This is marked contrast to the tone he took just a few months ago. In July, when he gave Congress his official mid-tyear review of the state of the economy, Mr. Greenspan had proclaimed the recession over, reported signes that inflation was slowing, predicted progress on the Federal budget deficit and was otherwise remarkably optimistic. 
 Early reports of yesterday's speech by Mr. Greenspan characterized it as more pessimistic than it actually was, and stock and bond prices rose as traders took the remarks as a signal that the central bank would act soon to lower interest rates.
 But Mr. Greenspan gave no indication even indirectly of his intentions in this regard. He has been under increasing pressure from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and others in the Administration to drive rates lower.

HEADLINE: The Flights From City Hall

 BODY:
For Mayor David Dinkins to accept an expense-paid trip to watch tennis in Germany has conveyed a casual attitude about the business of governing New York City. It's easy to understand why the Mayor, a tennis fan, might be tempted by the offer. But his easy acceptance warrants serious second thoughts.
The invitation, which includes free airline and hotel accommodations for the Mayor, a guest and two aides, was extended by a German promoter of the Compaq Grand Slam Cup in Munich. The Mayor described the promoter as someone with "connections" to the United States Tennis Association. Initially, that raised questions about an actual or apparent conflict of interest. 
 The association is negotiating with the city to expand the site of the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, and a great deal of city money is at stake. The Mayor denies any conflict, and to judge by the U.S.T.A.'s reaction there may well be none. But the timing, in any event, couldn't be worse.
Mr. Dinkins's much-publicized trip to South Africa will take him abroad for eight days starting Nov. 10. For him to depart again a month later for Munich will leave the employees and citizens of a city under strain to wonder if anyone is really in charge at City Hall. The appearances are not brightened by his promise to drum up economic activity. That's a claim familiar to all expense account claimants who fortuitously discover business necessity in personal travel.
No one begrudges Mr. Dinkins personal vacations or occasional foreign travel for reasons of commerce or ethnic solidarity. But there are limits. The city's finances are in turmoil. Morale among agency chiefs is plummeting to a dismaying low. The failing Health and Hospitals Corporation needs especially competent new management, and soon.
By planning two trips abroad in a month, Mr. Dinkins risks sending a signal of indifference about the city's painful agenda. Let others watch tennis; there's no one else to watch over City Hall.

HEADLINE: Japan's Worldly New Leader

 BODY:
Extraordinary economic success has made Japan a superpower. Yet its international profile has remained remarkably low. That's changing dramatically now, and the change will accelerate with the selection Sunday of Kiichi Miyazawa as Japan's next prime minister.
Mr. Miyazawa is an intellectual in politics, given to thoughtful reflection about Japan's postwar humiliations, present economic power and future global responsibilities. He is also a veteran broker within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, with the clout needed to build consensus policies and make them stick. 
 Perhaps most important, he is a committed internationalist with a strong command of English and a good understanding of the United States. Tokyo and Washington won't always agree during Mr. Miyazawa's tenure but they will understand each other's needs, a decided plus.
Toshiki Kaifu, the outgoing Prime Minister, enjoyed public esteem and was free of the personal financial taint that stains many Japanese politicians, including Mr. Miyazawa. But Mr. Kaifu remained a front man, a caretaker. When he pressed too strongly on issues like political reform and international peacekeeping, he was rudely dumped. Mr. Miyazawa is a dove on military issues, supporting a restrictive interpretation of Japan's U.S.-sponsored Peace Constitution. He disagrees strongly with nationalists who urge Japan to say no to the West and reassert power in Asia.
Mr. Miyazawa's term of office, following the collapse of Soviet military power, will likely see steps toward a settlement of the territorial dispute involving the northern islands, careful diplomatic initiatives toward North Korea and a reformulated security relationship with the U.S.
It is also likely to see increased Japanese participation in international peacekeeping and economic development. Japanese resources are indispensable to meeting the capital needs of the former Communist states. That's an agenda the U.S. ought to welcome. President Bush will have a chance to do just that when he visits Japan in a few weeks.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
One Homeland Each

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The road forward was mapped clearly for the Palestinians by the United States, Israel and a single Arab leader spectacular in bravery.
That was in 1978. The proposal put together at Camp David will be on the table again in Madrid, 13 wasted years later. 
 In 1978 the plan endorsed by Anwar el-Sadat, Menachem Begin and Jimmy Carter was the only logical and feasible road for the Israelis and the Palestinians to follow. It still is.
But then as now, Middle Eastern myth and distortion that have become accepted as reality worked against a solution. The hope is, as always everywhere, finally looking at reality plain.
The proposal was and is for five years of self-government for Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza. During that time, Israeli-Palestinian talks about the future would take place. Israeli military security would be less obtrusive, but maintained.
The leaders of the P.L.O. and the Arab states furiously rejected the proposal because they knew it would mean the end of the war to the death against Israel. Yitzhak Shamir, then Speaker of the Knesset, opposed self-government because he knew it could mean that total Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza could be watered down.
Now Mr. Shamir goes to Madrid to negotiate about taking that road. He has not abandoned Israel's political and historical claims. He hopes Palestinian self-government will remain autonomous, not become the new Palestinian state that he sees as militarily an Arab invasion pad, just short of suicide for Israel.
But he is hardly naive. He knows that creating an autonomous Palestinian government would also create new pressures. Standing still on autonomy would become more difficult every year. For peace, he is now taking a risk he was not ready to accept in 1978.
The Palestinians who show up in Madrid also have moved. They are willing now to talk about an interim solution -- which once would have meant a bullet in the head from the Palestine Liberation Organization. The P.L.O., weakened by decade after decade of failure, had to agree for the moment.
But the great distortion of the Mideast, which inspired a half-century of war against Israel, remains alive to fuel more decades of disaster. That is the myth that the entire problem was created by Israeli occupation of the West Bank, and cannot be solved without creating a separate Palestinian state.
The historic background to Madrid is that the Arab war against Israel began long before its independence, that the West Bank was seized and annexed by Jordan in 1948 without any niceties about it belonging to "Palestine" and that it was taken over by Israel after the 1967 Jordanian attack against Israel. It was captured not from nonexistent Palestinian forces but from the occupation troops of King Hussein.
Ever since, the King has been kept in power by the charity of other Arab monarchies, the passion of Arabists in Western foreign offices and the self-interest of Israel. For four decades they all protected him against his enemies, like the P.L.O. and the Syrians, and his idols, like Saddam Hussein.
That does not eliminate the desire of Palestinians for a homeland -- a mistake made by those Israelis who just stare through them. But it does underline the reality that the Palestinians have one homeland already. It is occupied not by Israel but by Washington's prodigal ally, the little King.
The British created his country in the early 1920's out of what was then the eastern part of Palestine. They handed the land and the Palestinian population over to a favorite foreign prince, the King's grandfather, because he found himself without a throne to sit on.
Name changes can't fool history. Jordan is Palestine. The solution is to connect an autonomous West Bank-Gaza with Jordan in a confederation that would recognize Israeli military interests on the West Bank -- yes, and a shared economic future.
That won't happen at Madrid. But it could start if the U.S., the Palestinians and the Israelis all so willed. Some day it will happen, sure as the Berlin wall did come down, sure as Anwar el-Sadat did go to Jerusalem. It is the only solution that makes human sense.
One homeland for Israelis, one for Palestinians -- but for God's sake, just one each.

HEADLINE: Prosecution of Pregnant Addicts Won't Prevent Crack Babies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is encouraging to see your support for Medicaid financing of drug treatment for pregnant addicts ("The Cost of Not Preventing Crack Babies," editorial, Oct. 10). But in making the moral and economic case for this needed reform, you did not mention the other essential component of any policy to bring pregnant women into treatment and to prevent harm to their fetuses: an end to prosecutions of pregnant drug users. 
 Many states have tried to use criminalization to reduce the number of babies born to drug-using mothers. More than 80 women have faced prosecution in at least 20 states for their drug use during pregnancy, usually by virtue of unconventional interpretations of drug-trafficking statutes. Several states have made drug use by pregnant women a violation of civil codes. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, efforts have been made in at least seven states (including New York) to create the new and separate crime of drug use during pregnancy.
The problem is that such laws and prosecutions have the effect of discouraging drug-using mothers-to-be from entering drug treatment programs or seeking proper prenatal care. Thus, they risk increasing the incidence of the very problem they were designed to curtail.
Last year some members of Congress, among them Senator Jesse Helms, were supportive of this trend. One provision of the failed bill to prevent drug abuse during pregnancy would have conditioned some Federal aid on certification that a state had criminalized giving birth to a drug-affected baby.
That sentiment has not changed on Capitol Hill, but it should. Absent any compassionate and realistic Federal leadership, the states are continuing to step up penalties and increase the number of prosecutions of pregnant drug users. Meanwhile, women who want to seek help are afraid to come forward, hoping to avoid the risk of jail time or of losing their children to the state.
Congress can help reverse this trend by encouraging a moratorium on prosecutions of pregnant women. That would be an essential part of any genuine effort to reduce the problem of crack babies. We need to restrain our societal urge to affix blame and to punish, and deal with this problem in a way that holds better hope for success.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Restoring Faith With Tongue Lashings and a Call to Arms

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
LIKE a preacher whose sermon is all the more inspired by his fear that the faithful are losing faith, the head of the world's largest advertiser issued a challenge to his peers yesterday.
In an exhortation filled with words like "belief" and "conviction," Edwin L. Artzt, the chairman and chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company, told the 82d annual meeting and business conference of the Association of National Advertisers that "we, as leaders of our businesses, simply must do a better job of demonstrating our own strong faith in advertising." 
 "Advertising to us is a source of competitive edge," Mr. Artzt added in his speech during the conference's first session on a chilly morning here. "Belief in advertising is not like breathing. It doesn't come naturally; it must be taught."
Mr. Artzt recommended that companies like those belonging to the association, the nation's largest and most influential marketers, commit themselves to what he called "better ways of developing advertising skills" among their employees. Intensive training "should start the day a new hire walks in the door and should never stop," he said.
Junior staffers could attend meetings "to observe senior managers work with advertising agencies," he said, participate in developing advertising campaigns and even attend in-house advertising sessions that simulate the creative process to build their experience so "they won't drive the agency nuts."
As important to effective advertising as training, said Mr. Artzt -- whose company led worldwide marketers last year, according to Advertising Age, with billings of $3.4 billion -- is creativity and "an environment that encourages experimentation."
The mid-1980's were "not one of our best times," in terms of creativity, Mr. Artzt recalled, "and we knew it."
To illustrate, he played a television spot for P.& G.'s Cheer detergent from the period, by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago. In it, two young men discussed the brand's attributes in a dull, stilted style. "It was standard Procter & Gamble slice-of-life laundry-room television copy," Mr. Artzt said dismissively.
Then, Burnett "strongly recommended a campaign that wasn't typical Procter & Gamble advertising," he added and, to illustrate, played some of the unconventional spots in which, to the sounds of operatic arias, a mysterious man with a mustache demonstrated how Cheer cleans.
These spots, he continued, "helped turn the Cheer business around."
DeWitt F. Helm Jr., the association's president, echoed Mr. Artzt. "Advertising's continued success and contribution to this nation hinges on a healthy advertising culture in corporate America," he said, "and on management's conviction that advertising truly is the engine that drives the economy and stimulates business growth.
"As its practitioners, each of us has a responsibility to advance the case for advertising," he added. "Simply stated, we must be missionaries for our own cause."
Michael J. Roarty, the executive vice president of corporate marketing and communications for Anheuser-Busch Inc., said advertisers must "serve not only as champions for our brands, but also as advocates for our basic right to advertise."
"Advertising is under attack," he said, by special interest groups, journalists and politicians, who "are using our advertising as a weapon against us." This "ad-bashing," as he put it, extends beyond critics of Anheuser's beer business, who would "try to push us into the same category as illicit drugs," he said.
"If it can happen to us," Mr. Roarty said, "it can happen to you." Like Mr. Helm, he used an automotive metaphor to describe advertising's role, terming it "the fuel line that powers the engine of economic growth."
Anheuser and its parent, the Anheuser-Busch Companies, spent $459.2 million on advertising last year in the United States, according to Advertising Age.
Cutting that fuel line is only "giving comfort to the enemy," warned James Jordan, the chairman of Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor in New York, the agency that created campaigns like "It's the right thing to do" for Quaker Oats. "Advertising isn't doing the job it used to do," he said, because too many advertising dollars are being diverted from traditional ad campaigns to short-term promotions, like coupons.
"Every dollar that goes into deals and promotions is a dollar that devalues a brand," Mr. Jordan added.
The conference, at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, ends today.

HEADLINE: Light at the End of Digital's Tunnel

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAYNARD, Mass.

 BODY:
For the Digital Equipment Corporation, the $14 billion computer giant, the last two years have been the worst of times.
The country's second-largest computer maker has experienced plummeting earnings, stagnant revenues, a staggering decline in hardware sales, huge layoffs for the first time in its history and dismal morale. A recent reorganization has driven off a spate of top executives, while Digital stock has languished below book value. 
 So why are so many analysts and consultants suddenly saying such nice things about the company?
Part of the answer lies in last week's announcement of powerful, aggressively priced VAX 4000 and VAX 6000 computers, up to three times as fast as current models. Analysts expect the new offerings to set off a resurgence in sales of Digital's key low- to mid-range lines.
"There's a pent-up demand for these systems," said Terry Shannon, a consultant with Gander Associates in Ashland, Mass., and a longtime Digital watcher. "This could be the beginning of a major turnaround for Digital."
These computers will serve as a bridge to Digital's next generation of machines -- code-named Alpha -- which will incorporate the popular RISC technology in late 1992.
"They are closer to the end of the tunnel than people give them credit for," said John Adams, an analyst with Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston. RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, is a simplified design approach that significantly speeds computer performance.
The company has bounced back before, some analysts point out. "Back in 1983, Digital was underperforming the industry, and a lot of investors thought the ball game was over for them," said Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities. "The investors were proven wrong then, and they will be again."
Overdue staff cuts are finally helping to get costs under control, many who follow the company say. Digital has taken $1.65 billion in reorganization charges since last year and cut 11,300 employees from a payroll of 126,000 since late 1989, with plans for the cutbacks to continue.
In the view of several analysts, Kenneth H. Olsen, the company's enigmatic founder and, for 34 years, its only president, only belatedly accepted the need for retrenchment. Mr. Olsen, 65 years old, has turned over day-to-day operations to John F. Smith, the senior vice president for operations.
"He's never had to lay off people like he's doing now," John B. Jones of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said of Mr. Olsen. "He's tired of it, and there's a lot more ahead."
Although analysts including Mr. Jones have urged Mr. Olsen to step down, those who have followed his career doubt that he will before he has restored his company's health. "Ken is going to leave when he wants to," Mr. Smith said. "He maintains he is going to live forever."
 
Analysts More Upbeat
 Even with Mr. Olsen staying on, the analysts have become more upbeat. Quarterly earnings, announced in mid-October, were only 23 cents a share, compared with 21 cents for the comparable quarter last year, but analysts praised the company's progress in a dismal economy.
Mr. Jones himself has upgraded the stock -- which closed yesterday at $61 a share, down 37.5 cents -- to an aggressive "buy." "They are realizing the error of their ways" and recognizing the need for their prices to be more competitive with those of I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, Mr. Jones said.
With enough cash on hand -- more than $2 billion -- to start a substantial bank, and little debt, the company sports one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Mr. Jones expects its share price to jump to $100 in the next 12 to 15 months.
Digital's resurgence is not yet an accomplished fact. Some critics contend that Digital has yet to prove its commitment to moving away from the proprietary hardware and software that fueled the company's tremendous growth during the late 1970's and 1980's.
"They are saying all the right words but doing the wrong things," said George Colony, a consultant with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "At the end of the day, this company still sells mini-computer systems, which will give you 3 percent growth a year and won't sustain 115,000 employees."
Mr. Colony said Digital needed to pare its payroll to fewer than 90,000. "They are getting something like $100,000 in revenues per employee, while companies like Compaq and Apple are around $300,000," Mr. Colony said. "They have to get that up to at least $175,000."
David Wu, an analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company, added, "Digital will have a turnaround, but it won't last for more than six months."
 
Senior Executives Depart
 Layoffs and a companywide reorganization have stripped many senior executives of their power, contributing to the departures of five vice presidents in the last 12 months, including James Osterhoff, Digital's highly regarded chief financial officer. Digital watchers expect more senior people to leave.
Mr. Smith, the senior vice president of operations, said the company has learned some valuable lessons from letting costs go wildly out of control during the late 1980's. "We're never going to let that happen again," he said. "Even if we started booming tomorrow, we wouldn't start hiring again."
The layoffs, however, have inflicted wounds that have changed the corporate culture forever. Gone is the expectation of employment for life that, though never official policy, was a tenet of the family-like environment that Mr. Olsen so carefully preserved.
 
'Family Feeling Is Gone'
 "The family feeling is gone, and a lot of people are angry that it's gone," said one employee, who requested anonymity. "There's also a feeling that even though a lot of the deadwood has been cut, there's still a lot more here."
Employees also perceive continuing disarray at the company's highest levels. Mr. Smith acknowledged that Digital's managers have done a poor job of sharing their vision with employees. "I hear about the confusion at the top," he said. "I know that people want to know what business we are going to be in in 5 to 10 years. We haven't communicated that as well as we should."
Rumors fly over the company's electronic networks about the future of Mr. Olsen. Mr. Olsen has never anointed a successor and has cautioned journalists not to read too much into Mr. Smith's expanded role.
But a company spokesman, Dallas Kirk, saying that Mr. Olsen's schedule would not allow a prompt interview, added that it was time to push Mr. Smith "out front" some more.
 
A Common Predicament
 Digital's predicament is common to several other major computer makers. A company that grew up as a maker of computer hardware has to survive in maturity as a provider of software and services. These two categories already account for more than half the company's revenues, playing off its unparalleled strength in assembling computer networks.
Digital readily ties hardware and software from other makers into its own equipment and services products from other companies as well. Digital's hardware sales, meanwhile, have fallen as improved performance at lower prices squeezes margins ever tighter.
"Pricing is horrendous for everyone in the industry," said Stephen Smith, an analyst with Paine Webber. Prices have dropped sharply in the last few years, he continued, adding, "Digital has to sell twice as many units in one year to generate the same revenue."
 
Losses in Hardware
 Digital lost more than $200 million on hardware sales in 1990 and is likely to lose nearly $500 million more in 1991, Mr. Adams, the analyst, said. At the same time, Digital's service sector is growing strikingly, from $450 million in profits in 1990 to an estimated $900 million in fiscal 1992.
Changing Digital's focus from hardware to software is not easy. Within a year, several popular Digital offerings, including its All-in-One office software, will be available for I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Sun computers, Mr. Shannon, the consultant, said.
Hardware still brings in nearly $6 billion in annual revenues and allows the company to sell the necessary sofware and services.
 
Pushing Into Personal Computers
 Digital is quietly pushing into personal computers, a market where it has floundered several times. Mr. Schulman estimated that Digital's customers would spend $10 billion on personal computers this year, and Digital is intent on expanding its current 4 percent market share.
Abandoning past efforts to design and build its own personal computers, Digital is now reselling machines from the Tandy Corporation and the Intel Corporation. Mr. Ryan said the company could turn an excellent profit by building networks around the personal computers.
The company expects its personal computer network business to grow to more than $2 billion by the end of its fiscal year next June.
 
Alliance With Microsoft
 Digital is also taking advantage of the breakdown in the International Business Machines Corporation's relationship with the Microsoft Corporation to forge its own alliance with the most powerful maker of personal computer software.
Mr. Schulman predicts a deal between Microsoft and Digital based on Microsoft's next generation of the popular Windows software and Digital's Alpha computers. David Cutler, who is designing Windows NT, helped create some important Digital software in the 1970's.
Whether all the changes at Digital will add up to a turnaround remains to be seen. But as Mr. Schulman, the analyst, said, "This is a company that has come back from adversity before."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Transit Green, Gridlock Blues

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
TO nobody's surprise, the seemingly interminable wrangle over the transportation reauthorization bill, now heading for a Congressional conference, is all about money: how much of it will Uncle Sam hand out, how will the states divide it, how much will go to mass transit.
What may surprise is the "pox on all their pork barrels" view of Peter Gordon, an associate dean of urban planning at the University of Southern California and author of a new position paper from the libertarian Reason Foundation. He reckons that much of the $100 billion to $150 billion slated for highway and mass-transit aid over the next half decade is bound to be wasted unless Washington turns over a new economic leaf. The alternative to gridlock as usual, Mr. Gordon argues, is a transportation policy that exploits opportunities to privatize, asks most users to pay their own way and subsidizes needy transit patrons rather than empire-building transit bureaucracies. 
 The White House wants to invest $105 billion in surface transportation over five years, mostly on highways. The House would opt for $151 billion over six years, raising the extra green by extending 2.5 cents of the nickel-a-gallon gasoline surcharge due to expire in 1996. The Senate's five-year, $123 billion version, the choice of many good-government types, puts more emphasis on repair of roads and bridges and puts a higher priority on mass transit.
But Mr. Gordon sees fewer distinctions here than differences. More cash for mass transit will simply mean more underused monuments to transit engineering, he predicts. And federally financed relief of highway traffic jams is, at best, a palliative because government does not have the wisdom or the will to charge road users according to the congestion they create.
Those seeking to learn from mistakes of the past, Mr. Gordon says, need only look at the newest transit systems, which carry far fewer passengers than expected and require enormous subsidies to operate. The Miami heavy-rail system, for example, is moving only 15 percent of the forecast traffic, and at a cost of $16.77 a ride. Even Washington's much admired subway scarfs subsidies like an armada of stealth bombers: each ride works out to almost $9.
Light rail -- called trollies in a less officious age -- doesn't have a much better record. The new system in Portland, Ore.carries just half the number of passengers projected, at a cost of $5 each.
These mistakes are not hard to explain, Mr. Gordon argues. Most cities do not have sufficient numbers of commuters living along narrow corridors to support fixed rail. And in many cases, commuting density is even too light to justify the use of full-size buses on fixed routes. But transit authorities keep investing in steel and concrete because the alternative is a loss of influence and employees. Highway policy is apparently no better grounded in the public interest. While private cars are (and will inevitably remain) the backbone of transportion through the urban sprawl, most roads cost nothing but time to use. And by no coincidence, most are choked at rush hour with cars on errands of marginal value.
Radical failure, Mr. Gordon believes, requires a radical fix. He would phase out mass-transit construction subsidies, convert operating subsidies to vouchers for low-income families and make all transit aid contingent on breaking local transit monopolies. The vouchers, modeled after food stamps, would support service for people who could not afford to commute by car. As important, they would create demand-driven transit systems -- ones that Mr. Gordon expects would evolve into flexible van and jitney networks operated by workers paid competitive wages.
He would also chip away at policies that encourage profligate use of roads. It may not be possible to eliminate existing tax-based subsidies for employer-provided parking. But one could even the playing field by allowing employees to receive transit vouchers in lieu of free parking without incurring added tax liability.
By the same token, Federal rules prohibiting tolls on "currently free" swatches of the interstate highway system may not be the only reason local governments balk at imposing congestion fees. But elimination of the prohibition would certainly do away with one good excuse. John Kain, a transportation economist at Harvard University, estimates that 90 percent of urban road congestion is caused by the underpricing of a key 5 percent of road capacity.
None of these reforms are even remotely possible, of course, unless public servants are prepared to risk the wrath of special interests grown accustomed to their perks. But then, in more naive times, one assumed that was what public service was all about.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plunges After Report On Consumer Uncertainty

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar plunged in heavy trading on world currency markets yesterday as an unexpectedly weak report on United States consumer confidence led to a selloff on the assumption that interest rates are headed lower.
Gold prices were narrowly mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $359.40 an ounce, up 40 cents from Monday. Republic National Bank said gold rose 55 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $358.90. 
 Traders initially reacted to what currency market analysts called a mediocre report on the gross national product. The Commerce Department said G.N.P. advanced at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the third quarter, the biggest advance in more than two years and an indication that the economy started growing again during the period.
The advance was only slightly below market expectations. But a separate report issued later by the Conference Board showed consumer confidence plunged in October, adding to the double-dip recession theory.
The selling "just snowballed," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "We just couldn't stop it."
With consumer confidence at recession levels and inflation not a serious threat, speculation has heightened that the Federal Reserve will move to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Lower interest rates are bearish for the dollar because they make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
"Interest rates are the only tool left to keep the boat afloat," Mr. Donney said, referring to a rate cut, which analysts said could come as early as Friday. Many analysts suspect that the Fed is waiting to review the October unemployment report, due to be released Friday.
The dollar sank nearly 4 pfennigs against the German mark before a very slight recovery on the close. The dollar also closed sharply lower against the British pound and the Swiss franc.
But because many traders were buying marks and selling Japanese yen, the dollar's decline against the yen was somewhat tempered, said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.43 yen, to a closing 131.85 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 130.75 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 130.60 yen, down from 132.29 yen on Monday.
In London the British pound rose to $1.7230, from $1.7040 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.7290 to buy one pound, up from Monday's $1.6943.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Growing Pessimism Among Consumers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell sharply in October, as Americans grew more pessimistic about the economy and the outlook for jobs, a survey said yesterday.
The Conference Board, a business research group based in New York, said its index of consumer confidence fell by 12.5 points, to 60.4, from 72.9 in September. The group said its barometer, whose 1985 base totaled 100, had fallen to recession levels. 
 The bleak outlook, if it is a true reading, poses potential problems for the economic recovery, since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product, which measures the nation's output of goods and services.
The Conference Board survey was released shortly after the Commerce Department said a 3.8 percent jump in consumer spending had helped raise the G.N.P. by 2.4 percent during the third quarter, the largest advance in more than two years. But concerns have arisen that slumping retail sales the last two months indicate consumers are retrenching during the current quarter.
The survey of 5,000 households, conducted by National Family Opinion Inc. in Toledo, Ohio, was a negative sign for retailers preparing for the Christmas season.
In addition, a survey released yesterday by ABC News and Money magazine showed that 47 percent of the respondents planned to spend less this Christmas, up from 38 percent last year, the most in the seven years of polling by the organizations. Only 11 percent of the respondents said they planned to spend more, compared with 14 percent in 1990.
David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic forecasting firm based in Lexington, Mass., called the results of the Conference Board surey "pretty miserable." He said consumer spending would pick up at some point, "but that point may be 1992."
Mr. Wyss added that Americans, reading about layoffs around the country, have gone from nervous to frightened.
"They're scared of losing their own jobs," he said.
Employment was of particular concern to respondents, with only 15 percent predicting that more jobs would be available in six months, down from 17.7 percent in September. Twenty-six percent said fewer jobs would be available, sharply higher than 20.1 percent the month before.
Mr. Wyss said consumers were unlikely to start spending until employment levels picked up. But, "businessmen are not hiring because they're not convinced the recovery's real," he added.
The Conference Board said respondents gave a darker assessment of current business conditions than in September. Less than 10 percent described present conditions as good, while 41.1 percent called them bad.
In September, 11.2 percent said business conditions were good, while 39.7 called them bad.
Predictions for the economy's future were also more pessimistic.
Fewer respondents said they expected the economy to improve within six months. In October, 18.8 percent predicted business conditions would pick up, down from 23 percent in September. Meanwhile, 13.9 percent said conditions would worsen, up from 10.8 percent the previous month.

Data Give Big Lift To Bonds

DATELINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices exploded and long-term interest rates fell well below 8 percent yesterday after the Government reported that a critical inflation measure posted a big decline in the third quarter. In addition, a respected survey showed that consumer confidence fell to recessionary levels in October.
The day's events only heightened speculation that the Federal Reserve Board would move soon to lower short-term interest rates to provide additional relief to what appears to be a faltering recovery. 
 A cut in rates by the Fed would almost certainly prompt commercial banks to lower their prime lending rates, now at 8 percent.
 
First Fidelity Move
 Indeed, one institution, the First Fidelity Bancorporation in Newark, said yesterday that it had cut its prime rate to 7.75 percent. The rate is used as a benchmark for other consumer borrowing rates.
No other leading banks followed suit, and analysts said most were likely to wait until they could lower their prime rate by a half a percentage point.
That probably would not occur until after the Fed pushes down the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market, or the discount rate, or both, the analysts said.
Speculation grew yesterday that the Fed might decide to cut the discount rate, the rate it charges banks to borrow at its discount window, to 4.5 percent, from 5 percent.
 
'Fed Will Have to Move'
 "If the October employment report is anything other than very good, the Fed will have to move," said Robert Chandross, the chief economist at Lloyd's Bank North America.
"The Fed wants to get the prime rate down as a way of making people feel better," Mr. Chandross said. He added that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and the other Fed governors were "aware that we are moving into November, and that a disproportionate amount of spending occurs in the last two months of the year."
"The Fed is running out of time to influence that," he added.
A report on employment conditions in October is expected from the Labor Department on Friday.
In a reflection of how badly consumers feel, an index of consumer confidence compiled each month by the Conference Board, a business research organization based in New York, registered a sharp decline in October, to levels it characterized as recessionary.
The survey, in conjunction with inflation data contained in the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate of economic growth in the third quarter, were all positive influences on the sharp increase in prices of Treasury notes and bonds.
So, too, was an article published yesterday in The Washington Post.
The article said that at the September meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee, Mr. Greenspan had received the authority to cut the overnight Federal funds rate, currently at 5.25 percent, by as much as half a percentage point.
A cut of that magnitude would be twice as big as the gradual reductions of 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, the Fed has taken over the last two years.
 
2.1% Inflation Rise
 The inflation report showed that prices of a fixed basket of goods rose at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the lowest rate of inflation in five years.
In its report on the gross national product, the Government said the economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate during the summer quarter. It was the first quarterly rise in growth in a year.
Nevertheless, the increase was somewhat less than had been anticipated. And analysts noted that much of the growth occurred early in the period. Since early summer, the pace of economic activity has faded, they said. The G.N.P. measures the nation's output of goods and services.
"It is hard to argue that the G.N.P. numbers are tremendously good," Mr. Chandross said.
The report followed by a day a sobering assessment of the recovery's prospects from Mr. Greenspan.
The change in his rhetoric from his previous pronouncements "wasn't a subtle shift," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation. "It was a major turn."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, traders took in all these developments and were heavy buyers of notes and bonds.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 21/32, up by more than 1 1/2 points, or more than $15 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 7.89 percent. Late on Monday, the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.02 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year securities were offered at 102 5/8 late yesterday, up by a full point, to yield 7.48 percent.
 
2-Year Notes at 5.88%
 In anticipation of an easing move by the Fed, the Treasury's new 6 percent two-year notes auctioned last week were offered on a when-issued basis yesterday at a price to yield 5.76 percent, down from 5.88 percent late on Monday.
Short-term Treasury bill rates also moved lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.87 percent late yesterday, down by 7 basis points. Six-month bill rates fell by 10 basis points, to a late-offered rate of 4.90 percent.
The rally in the Treasury market spilled over into the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Corporate traders said prices of most issues rose from three-eighths of a point to a quarter of a point in active trading.
Among the biggest gainers were debt securities issued by Salomon Brothers Inc. The scandal-ridden firm reported yesterday that its third-quarter results were much better than expected.
Yields on the 8 percent Salomon securities maturing in 1996, for example, fell to 9.90 percent, from 10.15 percent on late Monday.
 
Secondary Issues Up
 In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about half a point, traders said.
Among the tax-exempt issues priced yesterday was a $193.5 million competitive offering from Nevada.
A bid from an investor group led by the First Boston Corporation won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1994 to 2011.
The bonds were reoffered with yields ranging from 5.10 percent in 1994 to 6.60 percent in 2011.
The issue is rated AA by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

Key Comerica Figures Take Turns at Helm

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
When Comerica Inc. and the Manufacturers National Corporation complete their friendly merger, announced on Monday, the chairmen of the Detroit-based banks will take turns running one of the nation's 25 largest banking companies. Gerald V. MacDonald of Manufacturers National will be chief executive of the merged bank until 1994, when Eugene A. Miller of Comerica will take over.
The unusual agreement caps a 15-year relationship for the bank executives, who met when Mr. Miller approached Mr. MacDonald to take out a personal loan. Throughout their careers, they met frequently, and both became chairmen of their respective boards in early 1990. They started discussing a possible merger in February partly as an offensive answer to concerns that their banks might be acquired by unwelcome suitors. They held clandestine afternoon talks at a suburban Detroit hotel this fall to discuss the merger's details. "You date, then you get engaged, then you get married," said Mr. Miller at a press conference Monday. 
 Analysts said Mr. MacDonald, 52 years old, is known for his organizational skills, making him the most logical lead-off executive, while Mr. Miller, 54, is known for his abilities in planning, strategy and development. Until Mr. Miller succeeds Mr. MacDonald on June 30, 1994, he will be president and chief operating officer of the merged bank, to be called Comerica Inc.
Mr. MacDonald joined Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit 30 years ago. His posts there have included officer-in-charge of the Michigan banking and consumer-loan departments, and president and chief executive of a former affiliate, Manufacturers Bank of Southfield.
Mr. MacDonald received a B.A. in economics from the University of Michigan, and is a graduate of Rutgers University Graduate School of Banking. He is married, has two children, and lives in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
Mr. Miller began his career in 1955 with the Detroit Bank, the forerunner of Comerica. When Detroitbank Corporation was formed as a holding company in 1973, Mr. Miller was appointed treasurer, a position he held until 1980. In 1981, he was elected president, and was appointed chairman of the renamed Comerica Inc. in January 1990.
Mr. Miller holds a B.B.A. from the Detroit Institute of Technology. He is married, has two children, and lives in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.

HEADLINE: Economy Grew During Summer But Then Eased

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The economy expanded for the first time in a year in the July-September quarter, the Commerce Department reported today, but its chief economist acknowledged that the recovery had already started to lose momentum by Labor Day.
The third-quarter rise, at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, was presented by Bush Administration officials and many private economists as proof that the slump that began in July 1990 had ended. "The recession is over," asserted J. Antonio Villamil, the department's chief economist. 
 Yet even as Government figures were defining last summer's economic performance as the best in two and a half years, fears were growing that the incipient recovery would not be sustained.
 
Consumer Confidence Wanes
 The Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group, said its index of consumer confidence tumbled in October to what it called a recession-level reading of 60.4, far below September's 72.9 and only six points above its worst reading of 1981-1982 when the economy was suffering its severest postwar contraction. Various other indicators, including industrial output and auto and home sales, have been indicating that the rebound that began in late spring or early summer was in jeopardy.
The bond market rallied sharply on today's developments, which on balance appeared to increase the chances that the Federal Reserve would decide shortly that it needed to make another round of interest-rate cuts in hope of keeping the expansion going. Yesterday, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, characterized the economy as having turned "demonstrably sluggish" in recent weeks.
Although the central bank seeks to avoid appearing to respond to any particular set of figures, analysts said today that the Federal Reserve might reduce rates as early as Friday, when the Labor Department is to report on employment conditions during October.
The Federal Reserve, analysts said, will be encouraged that other data in today's report on the gross national product showed that inflation, as measured by the fixed-weight price index, subsided to a 2.1 percent annual pace, the slowest pace in five years, from 3.1 percent in the second quarter. The improvement in the implicit G.N.P. price deflator was even more pronounced -- to 1.8 percent from 4.5.
The latter, however, is not a pure gauge of prices since, unlike the fixed-weight index, its composition changes each quarter according to the mix of goods and services produced by the economy.
Administration officials once again urged greater policy accommodation. "Lower interest rates would be helpful to the economy," said Robert A. Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce.
The 2.4 percent rise in third-quarter G.N.P., which was essentially as expected, followed three straight quarterly declines during which the economy slipped into its ninth recession since World War II. Initially, G.N.P. for the second quarter was reported to have climbed at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent, but this was later revised to show a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Momentum Loss Acknowledged
 At a briefing, Mr. Villamil acknowledged that the economy had "lost some momentum" since summer but expressed confidence that the third quarter would remain positive through the two monthly revisions. He declined to predict whether the fourth quarter would be better or worse.
But private analysts, even while finding some sizable gains in today's report, were skeptical that a slowdown could be avoided. John E. Silvia, an economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, estimated the growth pace for the current quarter at 1 to 2 percent and would not rule out renewed contraction.
More than half the third-quarter growth came, as anticipated, from inventories as companies drew progressively leaner stocks down less rapidly than in the second quarter while also raising production in response to higher demand. Nonfarm inventories fell at a $12.9 billion rate in the summer quarter, less than half the $27.2 billion spring drawdown, adding $14.3 billion to third-quarter G.N.P.
Personal spending climbed at a 3.8 percent pace, up from 2.5 percent, with most of the increase in durable goods. There were also substantial jumps in residential investment and in output of producers' durable equipment.
On the other hand, exports weakened after having earlier helped to soften the recession and purchases by the Federal Government turned down at a $13.4 billion annual pace.
 
Recovery 'Under Way'
 Over all, real final sales rose six-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, compared to a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in the spring. Final sales were up even more, at a 1.4 percent rate, when transactions involving federally supported farm commodities are excluded.
"The recovery is definitely under way," said the National Association of Manufacturers, but "it will be unusually weak" in comparison with other postwar recoveries during which average G.N.P. growth has averaged 5.4 percent in the first 12 months.
Today's report also showed that the savings rate -- personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income -- fell to 3.8 percent from 4.2 percent during the first and second quarters of 1991.
Data included in the gross national product for the third quarter of 1991 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

HEADLINE: White House Threatens Banking Measure Veto

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
With Congress preparing to take up a comprehensive banking bill this week, the White House threatened today to veto any measure including a hard-fought compromise by two key Democratic chairmen. It is significantly more restrictive of banks than the Administration's proposal.
The White House announcement, which was not unexpected given the Treasury Department's harsh reaction to the agreement last week, raises the prospect that the months of political tussling between the Administration and the lawmakers over the details of the sweeping legislation could ultimately lead to a substantially narrower bill. 
 The main elements of such a measure would be likely to include a huge taxpayer loan to keep afloat the rapidly depleting insurance fund that protects bank deposits, as well as instructions to regulators to seize control of troubled institutions before they sink into insolvency.
Debate on banking legislation is expected to begin on the House floor this week, possibly as early as Wednesday. Lawmakers and their aides predicted that even if the agreement by the two Democrats, Representatives Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas and John D. Dingell of Michigan, was adopted by the House, it would fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed to overcome a veto by President Bush.
The agreement reached last week drops the Administration's proposal to permit industrial enterprises to own banks. While it would permit affiliations among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, it would restrict banks far more than the Treasury version or the measure adopted by the House Banking Committee in June.
A coalition of some of the nation's largest financial institutions today called the agreement between the Democrats "regressive" and urged Congress simply to pass the narrower legislation. The coalition's members include American Express, Bankers Trust, Barnett Banks, Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, Dean Witter, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance and Kemper Financial Services.
Generally, representatives of the insurance industry, which would be largely protected from encroachment of the banks, have been lobbying heavily in support of the agreement.
Years of disagreements between the Energy and Commerce Committee, headed by Mr. Dingell, and the Banking Committee, headed by Mr. Gonzalez, had been a key impediment to any broad banking changes.
A statement by the White House today said the Dingell-Gonzalez agreement would "weaken the banking system, impede the economic recovery, and increase taxpayer exposure to deposit insurance fund losses." The statement added that the existing law was "far more likely to keep banks stronger, safer, and more competitive."
It added that President Bush's advisers would also recommend that he veto any measure that substantially weakened the legislation's provisions to eliminate the restrictions on banks from expanding across state lines.
Presenting the agreement today to the House Rules Committee, which sets the procedure for the floor debate, Mr. Gonzalez took a swipe at the American Bankers Association, the industry's largest trade organization, for its intensive effort to defeat the measure.
"We're not here for the concerns and comfort and profitability of the banking industry," Mr. Gonzalez said. "We're here for the public interest."
He predicted that many of the issues would be revisited by Congress in future sessions because the bank insurance fund would probably require more than the $30 billion taxpayer loan that Congress is contemplating, in addition to the existing Treasury credit line of $45 billion.
Mr. Dingell said the banks needed restrictions to prevent them from broadly expanding into new businesses because they had failed to manage their existing business properly.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Casinos Are Not Such a Gamble

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen

 BODY:
GAMBLING industry stocks tend to be regarded as a big gamble themselves. High leverage, high fixed costs and the unpredictablility of high rollers all contribute to the uncertainties of an intensely competitive sector whose growth has long been curtailed because gambling is allowed in relatively few places. Only one pure gambling company, Circus Circus Enterprises, has an investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor's.
But although the sector will never offer blue-chip credentials, there are encouraging signs. Analysts cite the growing popularity of gambling, its widening acceptance, the resilience of the Nevada economy and the successful digestion of a number of new casinos. 
 "We believe that the gaming industry will continue to expand and be increasingly accepted as part of the general entertainment business," said Robert Nelson, a senior vice president at S.& P. "This should offer continued growth opportunities for the major gaming companies."
The prospects seem brighter in Nevada than Atlantic City, which is hurt by tighter regulations, overcapacity, the recession in the Northeast and the heavy indebtedness of several companies.
Donald J. Trump's properties, Resorts Casino Hotel and the Pratt Hotel Corporation's Sand's casino are all heavily leveraged. But after a terrible 1990, when the 12 Atlantic City casinos suffered a total net loss of $265.5 million, an upturn appears to have started in the second half of this year. Year-on-year revenues rose substantially in July and August.
Richard J. Byrne, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the improvement in Atlantic City should be bolstered by a move to 24-hour gambling on weekends, the concession of greater space to slot machines, a gradual improvement in the region's economy and an improved basic substructure for the city.
New gambling venues on riverboats and Indian reservations as well as in South Dakota are making gambling more widely accessible. Although this means new competition for Atlantic City and Nevada, the growth also offers new opportunities to established companies and should increase the appetite for gambling around the country.
"The spread of legalized gambling could garner us oppotunities beyond Nevada soon," said Glenn Schaeffer, the president of Circus Circus.
Circus Circus, whose annual increase in earnings per share has averaged about 20 percent over the last five years, describes itself as a "merchant of fun." Having recently built one enormous hotel-casino in Las Vegas, the mock-medieval Excalibur, it is about to announce plans for what it calls another "one-of-a-kind entertainment megastore." No wonder: operating cash flow at the Excalibur was about $103 million on revenues of $316 million in its first year of operation.Mr. Schaeffer is impassioned in his presentation of gambling as a form of reasonably priced family vacation entertainment, and his company's success suggests that this portrayal will become increasingly pervasive fairly soon.
Already, Kirk Kerkorian's MGM Grand Inc. has embarked on a $1 billion investment in Las Vegas that will combine a theme park and a casino in the most expensive test yet of family-style gambling. The Hilton Hotels Corporation, meanwhile, has long been successful in Las Vegas through a combination of its Flamingo Hilton, which has mid-market family appeal, and the up-market Hilton Las Vegas, which caters to the high rollers.
The world of high rollers, however, has found its most extravagant expression in Las Vegas at the Mirage Hotel of Mirage Resorts Inc., where many Asian players have been gambling as much as $12 million an hour on baccarat. So high are the stakes that Steve Wynn, the chief executive of Mirage, warned in his company's last annual report that the loss of the "most significant" of these players could have "a material adverse effect" on Mirage.
He is deleveraging the company, meanwhile, with the cash flow from the Mirage and said that he had already retired about $250 million of debt this year, bringing the company's borrowing down to $850 million. Promus Companies, with properties in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, has also been paying down debt.
With Las Vegas continuing to defy the recession -- its revenues rose 13 percent to $4.04 billion in the fiscal year ended June 31 -- the companies with a strong presence there appear well placed. These include Circus Circus, Hilton Hotels, Mirage and Caesars World Inc. Competitive pressures, however, are likely to be intense as new and ever more extravagant projects are developed to appeal to the family gambler of the 1990's.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 16.32 With an Increase in Volume

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks managed to keep much of their gains yesterday in active trading, as the Dow Jones industrial average closed 16.32 points higher, at 3,061.94.
Hugh A. Johnson, a senior vide president with First Albany, said the market was surprising, since the economic news of a 2.4 percent rise in the gross national product at an annual rate and later the Conference Board's report of an unexpectedly sharp 12.5-point decline in its consumer confidence index, was deeply troubling. 
 "While the G.N.P. report was in line with market expectations, the nominal G.N.P., which is before adjustment for inflation, was below expectations," Mr. Johnson said. "But the real problem was the Conference Board's numbers, which give us the first real hard look at what the economy did in October."
The stock market's normal response to the data was evident in the morning, when it dropped, Mr. Johnson noted. "Yesterday's market may have been looking beyond the third quarter, into the fourth quarter, or even into 1992."
After the decline in the morning, prices rose until a small retreat late in the day.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 192.8 million shares, up from 161.6 million on Monday. Rising issues outpaced losers by 1,031 to 610. The Big Board composite index rose 1.14, to 215.58, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.96, to 391.48.
Trading on the American Stock Exchange pushed the composite up 2.32, to 381.61.
In heavy over-the-counter activity, the Nasdaq composite rose 5.10, to 534.51, and the Russell 2000 index, another indicator of small companies increased by 1.16, to 181.90.
The Conference Board's confidence index fell to 60.4 in the month from a revised 72.9 percent in September. It was described as a return to recession levels, with the October reading only six points higher than the level posted in the trough of the 1982 recession. Bond prices rose on the report, as traders hoped the Fed would ease credit in response.
Among the notable issues yesterday, Xoma, rose 1 1/2, to 19 1/2, after a Federal court jury upheld its patent on a drug to treat a deadly bacterial infection. The company's rival Centocor, which the jury said had infringed Xoma's patent, fell 1 1/4, to 49, although some traders said that Centocor did not believe the verdict would affect introduction of its Centoxin, a similar type drug.
Genzyme, a diverisifed health-care products company, rose 1 3/4, to 49 5/8, after analysts at Shearson Lehman repeated a "buy" recommendation. On Monday the company reported record revenues and profits, which it attributed to sales of its Ceredase enzyme, a treatment for patients with Gaucher disease.
King World, a distributor and syndicator of television programs, among them "Candid Camera," fell 7/8, to 29 5/8. Ray Katz, another analyst at Shearson Lehamn, cut its rating to "neutral," from "outperform" because it had reached his target price of the low 30's.
Citing better-than-expected third- quarter earnings for SmithKline Beecham, Christina Heuer, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham repeated a "buy" recommendation. The stock closed up 2 5/8, to 60 1/4.
Shares of Time Warner rose 3 1/4, to 89 1/2, as American Television and Communications, up 3 3/8, to 54 3/8, said it would consider a Time Warner buyout offer. Toshiba and C. Itoh are also paying $1 billion for a combined 12.5 percent stake in a new venture, Time Warner Entertainment, which includes Warner Brothers movie business, HBO and other cable TV businesses.

HEADLINE: Britain and Vietnam to Force Refugees to Return

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Britain and Vietnam signed an agreement today opening the way for the forcible repatriation of tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees now being detained in Hong Kong.
The agreement comes one week after Hanoi agreed to accept the return of 222 Vietnamese "doublebackers," people who had come to Hong Kong once before, been paid a cash incentive to return to Vietnam and then re-entered Hong Kong illegally a second time. 
 Officials said the first of those people would be returned to Vietnam sometime next month. They will be flown from Hong Kong on chartered planes under armed guard.
Under the terms of today's accord, the authorities in Hong Kong will begin proceedings immediately to turn back any new illegal immigrants who arrive there from Vietnam. Later, the two Governments say they will extend the plan to deport many of the 63,500 Vietnamese who are confined in detention centers in Hong Kong, and cannot prove they are entitled to asylum as refugees from political persecution.
 
At Odds With U.S.
 The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, seeks to resolve the fate of people whose plight has become one of the more enduring legacies of the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese who ended up in Hong Kong in recent years are among the final wave of the so-called "boat people," the more than one million who fled Vietnam's Communist Government by raft and boat after the war ended in 1975.
But in signing the agreement, London appears to have put itself at odds with the United States, which continues to oppose forced repatriations to Vietnam for any reason. Officials in London said they had consulted closely with Washington during recent weeks, but refused to discuss what, if any, agreements or understanding had been reached prior to signing the agreement with Hanoi.
Earlier this year, President Bush and Prime Minister John Major exchanged letters on the boat people, and the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said earlier this month he was hoping to convince the Bush Administration to acquiese in the matter.
Officials in London have argued that most of the boat people are not fleeing political repression in Vietnam, but rather are economic refugees who left Vietnam because they are seeking a better life in Hong Kong, the British colony that will revert to China in 1997.
Opposition parties in Britain have also said they would oppose any agreement that would require people to be repatriated against their will. George Foulkes, a Member of Parliament and spokesman for Britain's Labor Party, expressed fears that the agreement will mean that Vietnamese will be repatriated "at the point of the gun."
A spokesman for the Foreign Office here refused to say whether the Government was prepared to use force against Vietnamese who do want to return to Vietnam. But in Hong Kong, Alistair Asprey, Secretary of Security for the colony, said the police were authorized to use force if necessary.
"We will attempt to let them return home with dignity," he said. "Whether they do so in the final analysis depends on their behavior."
In an attempt to calm fears among the Vietnamese in Hong Kong's detention camps, the Foreign Office issued a statement today saying that Hanoi had "confirmed" that no illegal immigrant who returns to Vietnam under the terms of the agreement will face persecution. The statement also said that Vietnam promised "to facilitate the monitoring of those who return by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to insure that those guaranteeds are fully respected."
In recent weeks, thousands of Vietnamese inside the camps have staged peaceful demonstrations against the repatriation plan and have threatened hunger strikes, suicides and armed resistance should the Hong Kong authorities try to force them to return to Vietnam against their will.
In 1989, when Britian forcibly returned 51 boat people, most of them women and children, to Vietnam, the action touched off riots in the detention camps and brought sharp protests from the United States.
Under today's agreement, any new arrivals will undergo screening immediately, a process that takes about six weeks, to determine whether they qualify for refugee status. If they do not, they will be returned immediately.
By dealing first with the new arrivals, officials say they can freeze the population already in the camps, a number that has grown by about 20,000 this year alone.
Of the estimated 63,500 Vietnamese currently in the Hong Kong camps, about 5,000 have qualified for official refugee status, meaning they fled Vietnam for political rather than economic reasons, and are eligible for resettlment. The others are awaiting disposition of their requests for asylum.
About 18,000 others have been classified as illegal immigrants rather than political refugees, and are therefore subject to deportation. The status of 40,500 more has yet to be determined, and the disposition of all the cases could take two to three years, officials in Hong Kong say.
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said the details on the deportation of those already in the camps in Hong Kong had not yet been worked out, and discussions were still continuing.

U.S. Repeats Opposition
 WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- Responding to the British announcement, the United States repeated today that it opposed the use of force to return boat people to Vietnam.
"We oppose forced or mandatory repatriation," the spokeswoman said. "We expect that under this agreement there would be no use of force."
The United States officials were vague about what steps the United States might take if Britain used force to return boat people to Vietnam.
Administration officials said that they understood the problems Britain faced in Hong Kong, with the thousands of boat people who do not qualify for refugee status. But the American officials said that, as far as they knew, President Bush had not given Prime Minister John Major any reason to expect the United States to acquiesce if Britain uses force.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS: Waiters at the Table;
Soviets Serve U.S. Needs for Parley In Hopes of Winning Economic Help

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 29

 BODY:
It is too early to say whether the Madrid Middle East peace conference heralds a new relationship between Arabs and Israelis, but it has already highlighted new relationships between Arabs and Arabs, between Israel and the United States and, most important, between the United States and the Soviet Union.
On the United States-Soviet front, it would not be an overstatement to say that the Soviets have literally made themselves an arm of American Middle East diplomacy in recent months, as they did everything possible to facilitate the peace conference to win American good will, which they hope to cash in later for American economic aid. 
 While the Soviets are technically co-sponsors of the conference with Washington, that is in name only. A senior European diplomat recalled today that when he asked the Soviet official supposedly working jointly with the Americans on the conference a question about seating arrangements, the Soviet official just shrugged and said: "You have to ask the Americans. We don't know anything. The Americans are handling everything."
 
A Revealing Whisper
 Indeed, the new Soviet-American relationship in the Middle East was perfectly captured in Jerusalem 11 days ago, when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Soviet Foreign Minister Boris D. Pankin held a news conference to announce that invitations to the peace conference were being sent.
Mr. Baker had written an opening statement about how the United States saw this historic opportunity, and he mentioned the general themes to Mr. Pankin before they took the rostrum. Before Mr. Baker was about to speak, Mr. Pankin leaned over and whispered in his ear, asking if Mr. Baker would tell the journalists that his statement was a "joint Soviet-American statement," as Mr. Pankin had none of his own. Mr. Baker gladly complied.
So it has been from the beginning of this peace conference diplomacy. Washington has written the story line and all the speaking parts, and the Soviets have entered and exited on cue. But what did they actually bring to the game? That is, was Mr. Baker bringing them along just out of habit, or was there really some value added by the Soviets' involvement?
 
Providing Cover
 The Soviets, Baker aides insist, made a definite contribution during the eight months it took to put the peace conference together. Their most important contribution, the officials argue, was not twisting arms of their former patrons; it was providing the Arabs with the symbolic cover that many of them needed to take part in what was essentially a "made in America" diplomatic initiative.
The Palestinians, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Syrians in particular needed the Soviets to be sitting next to the Americans to justify to themselves and their once-radical constituencies that they were not simply marching to an American tune. Even if that was the reality, the image would have been too hard to swallow for peoples in countries whose own self-identities have so long been nurtured on the notion of resisting American domination and "imperialism" in the Middle East, American officials say. The Arabs did not want to come to an "American" peace conference. They wanted an "international" conference.
"While the Arabs recognized the pre-eminent American role," said a senior American official, "they had an interest in demonstrating that this was not just an American show, because the Americans are perceived in the Arab world as pro-Israeli."
Beyond this symbolic role, the Soviets also wittingly or unwittingly played an important blocking role for Washington. The United States did not want either the United Nations or the European Community involved in its Middle East diplomacy -- particularly the community, which, unlike the Soviets, has real weight. By presenting the diplomacy as a joint Soviet-American initiative, Washington had the best of both worlds: a pliant Soviet partner and a perfect excuse to exclude the United Nations and the European Community.
In addition, the Soviets did use whatever residual influence they still have over their former Middle East clients to pressure the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership in Tunis to make sure that Yasir Arafat did not block Palestinians from the West Bank from participating in the conference, and to encourage the Syrians to take part. The Soviet intervention in this regard may not have been decisive, but given the Soviets' long relationship with the P.L.O. and Syria, American officials believe it was helpful.
"Whether they will be able to provide the same benefits in the future, we will have to wait and see," said the American official. "It will depend on how they operate and who they will decide to be as a nation."
 
Geographical Fact
 Whether there is a single Soviet foreign policy in the coming months or years, or simply Russian, Ukrainian and Georgian foreign policies, the Soviets cannot be written off in the Middle East, American officials insist. The Soviet Union or the individual Soviet republics are simply too geographically close to the Middle East, and have too many Muslims of their own, to be indifferent to events there.
The reshaped Soviet-American relationship has had a profound spillover effect on Israeli-American relations. With the end of the cold war, the Israelis can no longer argue that they are a strategic asset for the United States in the East-West global competition.
It was precisely that role that in the past encouraged Washington, and particularly the Reagan Administration, to overlook Israeli practices in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on the grounds that the situation there was a sideshow compared with the larger geopolitical struggle with Moscow, where Israel was a valuable ally.
What has happened with the end of the cold war is that the East-West conflict is no longer the central barometer of world stability. It has been replaced by smaller regional conflicts.
These regional problems, like the Persian Gulf war, are now viewed as the most immediate threats to world stability. As a result, Israel is now increasingly judged by Washington not by whose side it is on in the East-West conflict, but on the degree to which it is helping to promote regional stability.
The Bush Administration has made such a big fuss over Israeli settlements in the West Bank -- more than any previous administration -- because it views them as an obstacle to regional peace. American officials argue that the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, agreed to come to the peace conference precisely because he came to understand that his relationship with Washington, and future American economic help, would henceforth depend in large part on how he is perceived to be behaving in the regional context.
Finally, the collapse of the Soviet Union as a superpower, coupled with Iraq's defeat in the gulf war, has totally recast inter-Arab relations, virtually wiping out the Arab rejection front that always opposed any peace settlement with Israel.
Without Soviet military backing and diplomatic cover, that front -- Syria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq and the radical Palestinian factions -- has simply folded its tent, for now. The pro-American Saudi-Egyptian axis is now predominant. The fact is the only Arab rejection front today is in Iran, which is not even an Arab country.

HEADLINE: Belgian Troops, Defying Mobutu, Stay in Zaire to Assist Foreigners

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Belgian troops today defied President Mobutu Sese Seko's order that they leave Zaire immediately, and France and Belgium said their soldiers would stay as long as needed to evacuate foreigners.
Opposition leaders pleaded for the troops to stay. Mobutu loyalists "will massacre the opposition if the Belgian troops leave," said Frederick Mulonjo of the Union of Federalists and Independent Republicans. 
 Belgium said it would continue evacuating its citizens despite President Mobutu's demand. Most French citizens have left Zaire but 2,000 to 4,000 Belgians remain in Zaire, its colony until 1960.
 
Meeting With Opposition
 More than 50,000 people spilled into the streets of Kinshasa today, waving victory signs as soldiers fired into the air, mistakenly celebrating because they thought President Mobutu had agreed to reappoint the opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi as Prime Minister.
The Sacred Union opposition coalition quickly announced they were wrong, saying President Mobutu had met with Mr. Tshisekedi and other opposition leaders today but there appeared little change in the offing.
This Central African nation of 34 million people is degenerating into chaos, with unpaid soldiers leading civilians in looting and pillaging in the interior. Riots last month in Kinshasa left about 100 people dead.
 
Supported by U.S. for Years
 Zaire's mineral economy is in a free fall after 26 years of President Mobutu's dictatorship.
The Belgian oil company Petrofina stopped its activities in Zaire after military and civilian looters destroyed its plant in southern Mwanza, Belgian radio reported Tuesday. Chevron Oil pulled out on Monday.
For years, Belgium, France and the United States have been staunch Mobutu supporters, seeing him as a bulwark against Communism in the region despite charges of gross corruption and brutal repression.
Their support waned with the collapse of Communism, and all three countries cut aid to Zaire because of human rights violations.
About 950 French and Belgian paratroopers today continued the evacuation, but France said it was "only a question of days" before its 150 paratroopers pull out.
 
Peacekeeping Force Sought
 Belgium said Monday that it would ask the Organization of African Unity to send a peacekeeping force to Zaire. It would replace Belgian and French paratroopers sent last month to safeguard the evacuation of more than 20,000 foreigners after the Sept. 23-24 mutiny.
In Paris, the Foreign Affairs spokesman, Daniel Bernard, said 2,800 French citizens had fled the country, leaving 200, mainly missionaries and French people married to Zairian citizens.
In Nigeria, meanwhile, airport authorities reported the mysterious arrival Monday night of a Boeing 727 identified as a Zairian presidential jet.
An unknown number of people disembarked from the plane and were driven away before security officers rushed to the tarmac of Lagos international airport, according to the airport commandant, Wing Comdr. John Ojikutu. He said the plane had not been confiscated because it was an official presidential jet.

HEADLINE: Despite Billions in Tax Rises, States Slash Services

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Despite tax increases totaling $25 billion in the last 15 months, state governments are reducing their services as they struggle to survive the growing costs of health care and other expenses required by the Federal Government, says a report issued today by the National Governors' Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers.
The states were also battered by a limp economy that has had an effect "much worse than a normal recession," said Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors' group. 
 Twenty-nine states reduced the 1991 budgets they had previously enacted by a total of $7.5 billion, reducing financing for education and aid to local governments and initiating layoffs and furloughs of state workers, the report said.
"The states are getting whipsawed," Mr. Scheppach said. "On the one hand, we have a slowdown in revenues because of a sluggish economy coupled with the political unacceptability of tax increases. On the other hand we have an explosion in two major spending areas: Medicaid and prison construction."
 
Action in 32 States
 In the 1991 fiscal year, which for most states ended June 30, 32 states acted to address poor budget conditions, the report said.
One was New York, which imposed a wide range of cost-cutting measures, including reducing some programs, layoffs, a hiring freeze, reduced aid to localities, and delays in spending. New Jersey has resorted to across-the-board spending cuts, along with program reductions, layoffs, increased taxes and spending delays, while Connecticut invoked program reductions, layoffs and a hiring freeze, and this year enacted a state income tax.
Although 31 states raised taxes for the 1992 fiscal year, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, California and Texas accounted for almost 75 percent of the $15 billion of the new or higher taxes, the report found. Those increases came after 26 states increased taxes by $10.3 billion in the 1991 fiscal year.
Mr. Scheppach said that because of Federal requirements states now spent an average of nearly 20 percent of their budgets for Medicaid and prison construction, which had eroded their ability "to invest in other key areas such as education, infrastructure and the environment."
 
'Going to Go Broke'
 State payments for Medicaid, the Federal-state program of health care for the poor, increased to an average of 13.6 percent of state budget from 10.2 percent since 1986, according to the report. State spending on prison construction, which frequently is required by the courts in an effort to ease overcrowding, increased by 12.7 percent in the 1990 fiscal year and 11.4 percent in 1991, the report said.
In interviews, several governors underscored the gravity of their fiscal plight. "We'll have to lay off employees this year," said Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont. Gov. George A. Sinner of North Dakota said that since he became Governor in 1985 "we've cut the budget five times."
Speaking of growing health care costs, Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington said, "We're going to go broke at the state level if we don't do something about it."
In the 1989 fiscal year, no state budget was lower than that for the previous year, according to the report, but three were lower in 1990, six fell in 1991 and seven were lower for 1992.
In the 1991 fiscal year, 12 states laid off workers, while seven used furloughs, the report said. A total of 25 states invoked hiring freezes, 18 had travel freezes and 28 cut specific programs.
The governors expect their fiscal problems to outlive the recession. "The bottom line is that 1992 is going to continue to be a very difficult year for states -- perhaps the most difficult in the last decade," Mr. Scheppach said. "There are no easy solutions, and it is likely that many of these problems will not go away with an economic recovery."

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Impose a Trade Ban on Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 29

 BODY:
In a sharp increase in pressure for a return to constitutional rule, the United States announced a strict ban on trade today with Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country. The measure comes nearly a month after soldiers overthrew the nation's first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The trade ban comes after the Organization of American States unanimously approved a resolution this month to impose stringent sanctions as a means of reversing attempts to legitimize the overthrow of Father Aristide, who fled the country at gunpoint Oct. 1. The ban makes exceptions only for narrowly defined humanitarian aid, including some food.
Beginning Nov. 5, according to an executive order signed in Madrid today by President Bush, "all commercial trade" with Haiti, including both imports and exports of goods and services, will be indefinitely suspended. By some estimates, the United States accounts for nearly three-quarters of all Haitian trade, as well as most of its foreign investment.
Since the imposition of limited sanctions against Haiti by the United States this month banning all American transactions with the Haitian Government, diplomats say, Washington has struggled over sending an even stronger message to the provisional leadership here, while not irreparably damaging the fragile economy and further hurting the country's poor.
 
U.S. Urges Repatriation
 A United States statement on the embargo made public here seemed to address these concerns, saying, "The disruptions which these additional sanctions will place on the Haitian economy have been brought upon the Haitian people by those who seized and hold power today."
In anticipation of new hardships and the danger of civil strife, the State Department ordered the repatriation of all "nonessential" personnel from Haiti, and diplomats here stepped up efforts to persuade as many as possible of the 8,500 American citizens registered with the United States Embassy here to leave the country.
Haitian reaction to the embargo was mixed, with people applauding it or denouncing it, depending on their feelings toward Father Aristide. Nearly all, however, expressed trepidation about the effect on the nation, where the annual per capita income hovers at about $360.
"For 187 years we have been used for this kind of action," Jean-Jacques Honorat, Haiti's provisional Prime Minister, said in a telephone interview. "A commercial embargo against a country that produces nothing will be all-out barbarism. We will have to eat each other soon."
 
Legislators Displeased
 Asked if he thought the measure would result in greater accommodation by the Haitian military, Mr. Honorat said, "I don't think this will force any Haitians to their knees."
Haitian legislators who voted to declare Father Aristide's office vacant and appointed an interim Government to replace him expressed displeasure, while allowing that the measures might speed discussions with an O.A.S. mission expected in Haiti on Thursday.
"At least Nov. 5 gives us until the end of the week to do something," said Guy Bauduy, a former Senate leader. "If we came to an agreement with the O.A.S. mission while it was here, the sanctions could be rescinded."
 
Popular With the Poor
 Father Aristide remains very popular with Haiti's poor masses, but is loathed by many in the small educated elite as a threatening figure who, they say, legitimized vigilantism and showed little respect for institutional checks and balances.
In Carrefour-Feuilles, a poor hillside quarter of tin-roofed shacks overlooking the capital's broad bay, residents on Monday spoke with enthusiasm for the sanctions, which have been widely predicted.
"It doesn't matter if we have to go hungry," said one young man as a crowd of Father Aristide's supporters gathered. "If they have to flatten the country, just bring him back.

HEADLINE: U.S. UNVEILS RULES TO LIMIT ACID RAIN

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency today proposed regulations to cut in half the kind of air pollution that is mainly responsible for acid rain, while allowing for the first time the widespread buying and selling of pollution rights to cut the costs of compliance.
The proposed rules, required under revisions to the Clean Air Act that passed last year, were welcomed by environmental groups and by industry as a signal that innovation and consultation, rather than obstruction and confrontation, can guide the development of costly new environmental rules. 
 But the electric utility industry, whose coal-fired boilers in the East and Middle West are the primary focus of the regulations, warned that in some areas the costs of compliance would spur double-digit increases in electric rates.
William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the buying and selling of pollution rights would cut the utilities compliance costs by $1 billion per year, to about $3.8 billion, and that only the most polluting plants would have to seek extraordinary rate increases.
 
'Correcting' Problem
 "For many years the environment has subsidized some very heavily polluting plants," he said. "Now we are correcting that."
The regulations would not begin to take hold until 1995 and the main effect would not be felt until the year 2000. But as the emissions are reduced, Mr. Reilly said, people would be able to see the difference in the clarity of the air in much of the country, especially the eastern half.
Electric companies now have one last chance for public comment before the final rule is issued in May.
The Edison Electric Institute, an association of investor-owned electric companies, said that in general its members supported the Administration's proposals and welcomed the system of buying and selling pollution credits. Buying, selling and trading pollution allowances was one of the central innovations of the 1990 Clean Air Act.
 
Accumulating Credits
 Much of acid rain is produced when sulfur dioxide, a byproduct of coal, oil or natural gas plants, enters the atmosphere. There it is transformed into acidic compounds that drop back to the earth, damaging trees and altering the chemistry of lakes and streams.
Under the proposal released today, a coal-fired utility that does better at cleaning up sulfur dioxide than the regulations require could accumulate credits for sale to another company that failed to clean up enough.
In theory, companies that can clean up pollution cheaply by changing fuel or persuading their customers to conserve energy would recover some of the cost by selling their pollution rights to companies that could only clean up by adopting costlier measures, like filtering the smoke they emit. The air would be just as clean, but the costs would be lower.
In effect, clean air would become a commodity with known production costs, and traded under laws of supply and demand as if a reduction in noxious emissions were a pork belly. Indeed, the futures market at the Chicago Board of Trade plans to trade the pollution allowances.
 
Using Market Forces
 "For the first time, all of these market mechanisms usually associated with profit and pollution will actually be working to clean up the environment," said Daniel J. Dudek, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
The group, along with other environmental and industrial interest groups, helped write the regulations. It is an approach being used more and more to develop regulations by consensus.
A major point of contention remaining in the rules may be the provisions for monitoring emissions at coal-fired boilers. These provisions are considered crucial, since companies will actually be buying and selling the presumed reductions in pollution.
The rules' first phase, taking effect in 1995, will affect 110 utility plants in 21 Eastern and Midwestern states where the problem of acid rain is most severe. The rules will later expand to cover virtually all power plants that burn fossil fuels so as to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by about 10 million tons, or roughly 50 percent.

HEADLINE: Wealthy Couple Repays Alma Mater: $51.4 Million to University of Houston

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
In a tale of love and money, John J. Moores and Rebecca Baas of Sugar Land, Tex., were high school sweethearts who struggled to make it through the University of Houston in the 1960's and then made it big with their own computer software company.
Now quite wealthy, the Mooreses have given their alma mater a total of $51.4 million this year, the largest donation ever made to a public university in the nation. 
 "If the university had not been in Houston, it is highly doubtful that either one of us would have gotten a degree," said Mr. Moores, the 47-year-old founder and chairman of BMC Software Inc. "We are very grateful and wanted to help the school and help people who are like us, going to school part time."
The Mooreses have made eight donations in 1991 that total $51.4 million. They include $25 million to build a new athletic building and renovate existing sports fields; $11.5 million to the university's College of Optometry, which runs the River Blindness Foundation, and $10.2 million to build a new concert hall for the School of Music. Other, smaller grants went to support superconductivity research, a creative writing fellowship program, library improvements and scholarships.
"When my wife and I were undergraduates, we used to share the thought that someday perhaps we could help one or two students get through college," Mr. Moores said. "We never dreamed we'd be able to do something like this as quickly as we have. But it's fun."
 
Tough Times Still Ahead
 Even with a record donation, the University of Houston, which is state-financed, faces difficult economic times. Tuition at the 33,600-student university is scheduled to increase next September to $20 per credit hour, from $18. Average costs this year for tuition, room, board and fees is $6,400.
Most states cut their higher education budgets this year, forcing many public universities to raise tuition and cut costs. The president of the University of Houston, Dr. Marguerite Ross Barnett, said the Mooreses' donations represent a new trend in higher education, in which state-financed universities are turning increasingly to private support from alumni, corporations and foundations to fill the gaps left by the reduction of state assistance.
"You're going to see more convergence," Dr. Barnett said. Private schools, she said, "are looking to public sources to support scholarships, and the publics will be pursuing more private university strategies to maintain appropriate levels of funding."
Large private contributions once were the sole province of the wealthy and well-established private universities, like Harvard, Yale and others in the Ivy League, whose graduates often went on to successful and lucrative careers. Of the 10 top contributions made to higher education since 1967, all but two have gone to private institutions. Public universities were considered to be well taken care of by public money.
 
Change Over the Years
 But in recent years, as the publicly supported universities improved and state support withered, graduates who have increasingly taken their place at the head of profitable businesses have made substantial donations.
The largest donation to a public university before the Mooreses' was $41 million in 1988 to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
John Moores and Rebecca Baas met in their American history class in junior year of high school. They married at the end of their freshman year at the University of Houston, where they were part-time commuting students, working and studying at the same time. By the time they graduated in 1970, each with a degree in economics, they had two children.
Mr. Moores went to work for I.B.M., then for the Shell Oil Company, where he noticed that the company's big main-frame computers were sometimes agonizingly slow. He developed programs to speed them up and, in 1978, went to work for himself, developing new programs to increase the speed and efficiency of existing computers. In 1980, with $1,000 in a Houston bank account, Mr. Moores started his company, BMC Software.
It now has 41 different programs and is a $90-million-a-year business with customers like CSX, Pizza Hut and other Fortune 500 corporations.
Mr. Moores said he decided to make the donations now, rather than after he had retired, because he was interested in seeing how the money will be used.
"We always thought it would be kind of fun to watch the buildings go up," he said, "and frankly we intend to do more through the years."

HEADLINE: Florio Tells Voters in '91 to Send Bush a Message for '92

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio urged economically battered voters tonight to "send a message" to President Bush by voting against Republicans in the elections next Tuesday for control of the State Legislature.
"If the people who are hurting want to send an advance message to the President, prior to next year, they can vote against Republicans in this year's election," Mr. Florio said in a speech to about 800 Essex County Democrats. "That will send a message." 
 The Governor also broadened his attack on the Republican Party beyond economic concerns, referring at one point to the Republican candidate for governor in Louisiana who was a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Florio said that if people "want policies that are divisive and encourage bigotry, so that David Duke can feel at home in their party, they will vote Republican."
 
A Plea to Fight Back
 Although his fiscal policies had been under attack and his name had been used disparagingly in almost every Republican campaign advertisement, Mr. Florio had stayed out of the legislative campaign until about two weeks ago.
Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's spokesman, said the Governor had decided to step into the campaign because he felt that the Republicans were being allowed "a free ride" to attack the Democratic program without anyone fighting back.
Mr. Shure said that in 1990 the Republicans in the Legislature knew about the state's financial problems as quickly as the Democrats did. But the Republicans, he said, "made a political decision to say to the Democrats, 'You provide every vote for the taxes, and we will run against them.' " Democrats now hold majorities of 23 to 17 in the Senate and 43 to 37 in the Assembly.
Governor Florio was not scheduled to address the Essex rally tonight, a traditional pre-election gathering, until an aide called the county party and asked that the Governor be given time to speak.
In a year when most Democratic legislative candidates in New Jersey are running without mentioning their party or taxes, the Governor is now chiding them to "get off their knees." He has urged them to become "javelin throwers instead of javelin catchers" by talking about the benefits that were paid for by the $2.8 billion tax package pushed by his administration and approved last year by the Legislature -- benefits like property tax relief, increased school aid and transportation improvements.
Tonight, in his speech at the Quality Inn in downtown Newark, the Governor changed his imagery, saying: "I'm tired of Democrats being punching bags. I always believed it was better to be a hand-grenade thrower than a hand-grenade catcher."
Mr. Florio said that if people think about it, "they know that the Reagan-Bush economic policies of the last decade are the direct cause of the current national Republican recession that is causing them hardship and eating up their savings."
The recession, he said, "has thrown millions of our people into the unemployment line, depressing the economies of all our states, forcing governors and legislatures across this nation to cut needed services and increase state and local taxes."
 
Of Donkeys and Ostriches
 As he has in the past, Mr. Florio aimed some of his sharpest comments at Democrats who "think that they should try to sound like Republicans." He called that tactic -- one that seems to have been adopted by Democratic candidates across the state -- "wrong in principle and politically stupid."
"Trying to sound like a Republican is not the way for Democrats to help people, especially middle-class people," Mr. Florio said. "Just because the Republicans have changed their symbol from the elephant to the ostrich is no reason why we should ever consider changing ours from the donkey to a chameleon."
Mr. Florio's asking voters to send a message to Mr. Bush is reminiscent of his campaign for governor in 1981, when he asked voters to send a message to President Reagan about their economic worries by voting Democratic. Mr. Florio lost that race to his Republican opponent, Thomas H. Kean, by 1,979 votes, the narrowest margin in state election history.

HEADLINE: House Leaders Say a Compromise Is Now Possible on Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
House leaders of both parties moved today to try to make a deal to enact extended unemployment benefits, suggesting that enough political points had been scored and that it was time to get checks to the jobless. But senators and the Bush Administration held back.
Since late July, Democrats and some Republicans have supported programs providing up to 20 weeks of benefits for people out of work more than half a year, to be paid for by increasing the Federal deficit. The Administration has rejected these measures, calling instead for a narrower proposal that would be financed, in part, by selling unused radio frequencies. 
 While the Democrats have used the issue to charge that President Bush does not care about hard-pressed Americans, Republicans have insisted that the dispute shows that the Democrats are heedless of budget difficulties and are more concerned with politics than with the jobless.
Today, at the urging of Representative Robert H. Michel, the House minority leader, Democrats held off action on a third attempt to aid the unemployed, one that would have financed the $5.2 billion measure through additional taxes, though not immediately. Mr. Michel asked Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, for a delay to see if a compromise acceptable to the White House could be reached.
 
Time to Compromise
 An aide to Mr. Michel said the idea that it was time to compromise had been discussed briefly with President Bush on Monday at a meeting at the White House and later in the day in a lengthy telephone call between Mr. Michel and Mr. Bush.
But Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said: "We're not party to any discussions. We're still supporting Senator Dole." Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has proposed a $3.1 billion measure financed largely through sales of radio frequencies.
Mr. Dole also said there was no evidence of movement. And while SenatorLloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said he was interested in making a deal, Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, displayed no interest in compromise.
Mr. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, said of Mr. Bush, "If he's now prepared to reverse himself on unemployment, we'd be very happy." He said that "the President's position has been adamant and wrong and has resulted in millions of Americans not receiving" benefits they should have received.
Mr. Bentsen said he had some ideas about bridging the gap between the two parties, adding: "I want to get it into the hands of the people who are out of work. We have to reconcile our differences."
Mr. Rostenkowski said he was hopeful that a deal could be struck. "I've got phone calls out," he said. "But they haven't responded."

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut Bill Unlikely In 1991, Speaker Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Congress is unlikely to cut taxes this year, the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said today.
"I would personally like to see it this year," Mr. Foley, a Washington Democrat, told reporters. "I want to see it go as far as we can move it this year." 
 But Mr. Foley said Congress planned to adjourn for the year before Thanksgiving Day, and he added that he was not sure a tax-cut bill could make its way through the House and the Senate by that time. In fact, he said, "the possibility of full enactment by Christmas is not great."
Support for a tax cut gained momentum last week after Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, proposed a reduction to try to help the economy pull out of recession. Several rival plans surfaced, and the Bush Administration announced it would try to put together a proposal with Republicans in Congress.
But Republican leaders said Monday that President Bush was not eager to rush forward with a plan for fear it could weaken the economy, and Mr. Bush himself indicated he would not propose a tax cut at this time. Some Democrats have expressed similar reservations.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Is Now Getting Serious About Its Drive for Independence

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, U.S.S.R., Oct. 26

 BODY:
Real statehood may still be a distant glimmer and the way to it hazy, but the Ukraine is demonstrating with increasing force that its drive to independence is not a passing whim.
Recently, the Ukraine declined to join eight other republics in signing an economic agreement and refused to send delegates to a new union parliament. A new Ukrainian currency is being printed in Canada, and all candidates for election to a new executive Ukrainian presidency scheduled for Dec. 1 have come out staunchly for independence. 
 Then last week the Ukrainian Parliament passed a flurry of measures further staking out its claims to sovereignty, including authorizations for a 400,000-man army and a central bank.
Western governments that until recently looked at the Ukraine's claims with some skepticism, presuming that in the end the Ukraine will join with Russia and Byelorussia at the core of a new, looser union, are beginning to look more seriously at the independence claims of a republic of 52 million that could become the fourth most populous nation in Europe. If the Ukraine sought the same kind of independence that was won by the three Baltic republics, that would in effect be an end to the Soviet Union.
Political leaders in Kiev acknowledged that many of the measures, most notably the army move, are more symbolic than feasible. They predicted, further, that the Ukraine probably would sign the economic agreement before long, though with several conditions and reservations.
 
Visitors Are Common
 But even those Ukrainian politicians who express exasperation with their Parliament's naive readiness to adopt anything that defies Moscow or plays to Ukrainian nationalism are adamant that full sovereignty is an incontestable goal, which barring some cataclystic change, is likely to win strong approval in a referendum on Dec. 1.
"All the dynamics of Ukrainian politics are toward independence," a Western diplomat said.
The Ukrainian leader, Leonid M. Kravchuk, recently visited the United States, and Western officials now arrive in Kiev with increasing frequency -- and not just at the tail end of a visit to Moscow. Recent visitors from Washington included the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Treasury and a Deputy Secretary of Defense. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany visited as well.
In the Russian federated republic, too, the idea is reluctantly taking hold that the Ukraine's participation in any new union can no longer be taken for granted. While there are still strong rumbles among Russians that parts of the Ukraine are really Russian, most notably the Crimea and Odessa, the Russian leadership under Boris N. Yeltsin has accepted that Soviet internal borders are best left as is. Further, Mr. Yeltsin has accepted in principle the Ukraine's right to go it alone.
"There is still a Russian psychology that holds that the Ukraine and Byelorussia can never have pretentions to independent statehood," said Les Tanyuk, head of the Ukrainian parliamentary commission on culture and a member of the Rukh nationalist movement.
 
Fighting Revival of Center
 "Some of our Ukrainian leaders, like Fokin and Kravchuk, are still of that old school, always trying to please the Russians," he said. "That's why we have to fight against any revival of the center. That's why we can have an economic agreement with other republics, but never an economic association."
Vitold Fokin, the Prime Minister, was previously head of the Ukrainian branch of Gosplan, the central planning agency, and Mr. Kravchuk was formerly a Communist Party official in charge of ideology.
But a new wave of politicians from the Ukraine, some ethnic Russians among them, are increasingly irritated by any hint of condescension from Moscow or the West. The Russian-dominated central television is accused of treating Ukrainian developments in a patronizing and skeptical tone.
The politicians seem especially irritated by the West's continuing preference for dealing with Mr. Gorbachev.
"People come and tell us, look here, Europe is uniting and you're disuniting," said Viktor I. Antonov, the Ukrainian minister for the defense complex and military conversion. "But for 70 years we lived under the myth of unity. For 70 years Moscow told us, 'Don't meddle, just produce what we tell you to produce.' "
He continued: "There's a huge distrust of Moscow. What we need today is a chance breathe some freedom, to really feel some sovereignty. Then maybe in five years or so we start talking of uniting, or some association."
The idea that the Ukraine will never get a fair break from Moscow unless it establishes its independence runs strong. None of the leaders deny that the Ukraine cannot go it alone economically, given the elaborate links with Russia and other republics and especially its dependence on Russian oil.
But Mr. Antonov argues that a true economic union can come about only when the Ukraine becomes sovereign and puts its relations with other republics on a normal bilateral basis, instead of having its affairs decided in Moscow.
Among issues that must still be negotiated, he said, are the distribution of the property of the former Union, a predominance of which is in Russia, and methods for distributing and financing foreign credits.
But in the Ukraine, as in the Russian Republic and elsewhere around the former Union, the haste to break free of the old empire -- already referred to in official Ukrainian documents as "the former Union" -- is not matched by any concrete idea of how to do it, or exactly what "independence" entails.
 
'Nobody Listens' to Problems
 "When the talk is of creating an army, everyone applauds," Mr. Antonov said. "But when economists speak about the problems of going it alone, nobody listens."
Without a "center" to blame for their woes and against which to unite their forces, the Ukrainians are rediscovering the deep division in their own nation: The western Ukraine, largely Greek Catholic, is a bastion of Ukrainian nationalism and stronghold of the Rukh organization. The eastern Ukraine, including the Don coal basin, is more Russified and has close economic ties to Russia. The south -- the Crimean Peninsula and Odessa -- has only tenuous Ukrainian roots.
Political leaders have also found that the two-year-old Parliament, still heavy with former Communists, is far happier spouting oratory about sovereignty than pushing through real economic or political reforms. Last week, while sidestepping the more tangible issue of privatization, Parliament blithely passed the measure to create an army, not pausing to think what the army would do or who would pay for it.
In the process, some ill-considered comments about control of the nuclear forces based in the Ukraine prompted a flurry of anxiety in the West and in Moscow, compelling Parliament to hastily adopt a reassuring declaration that the goal was to rid the republic of all nuclear weapons.
At the same time, Parliament lambasted Prime Minister Fokin for suggesting that Kiev should sign the economic agreement with other republics, and razzed Vladimir B. Grinev, deputy speaker of the Ukrainian legislature and a respected leader of the political center, when he suggested that it was in the Ukraine's interest to keep the ruble stable.
"Anything that's proposed against the 'center' or for 'sovereignty' is joyously passed," Mr. Grinev said. "The deputies view 'sovereignty' as a glittering star, but they have no idea how to move toward it."
But leaders like Mr. Grinyov are increasingly conscious of the need to shed the image of irresponsible spoilers. He approvingly cited the recent advice of Zbigniew Brzezinski, the foreign-affairs adviser to President Carter, who urged the Ukrainians to adopt their own political program instead of simply resisting programs drafted by other republics.
For all his frustration with Parliament, Mr. Grinev, a Russian from Kharkov who learned to speak Ukrainian only after being elected to Parliament, is as adamant as every other presidential candidate in his opposition to the revival of any new "center."
"No Union structures should survive," he declared. "All should die, including the presidency. Any attempt to reanimate the old center, including this Supreme Soviet, is doomed."
By most tallies, Mr. Kravchuk, who quit the party only recently, is the front-runner in the race, drawing on a respectable record and a conservative populace reassured by the continuity he represents. The champion of Ukrainian nationalists is Vyacheslav M. Chornovil, the candidate from Rukh, with strength in the western Ukraine. Mr. Grinev, who gained respect for his swift and firm stance against the coup in August while Mr. Kravchuk waffled, is considered the candidate of the democratic intelligentsia.
Beyond these distinctions, the race has revealed other outlines of future political discord. Former Communists, for instance, have emerged as some of the most ardent supporters of independence, apparently because they believe that they have a better chance of regrouping in a conservative Ukraine than in a federation dominated by Muscovite reformers.
"With so many political forces, you get totally unexpected results," Mr. Grinev said. "Sometimes it produces diamonds, but sometimes just a swamp."

HEADLINE: 9 STATES IN EAST PLAN STRICT LIMITS ON CAR POLLUTION

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Governors of nine Eastern states and the Mayor of Washington agreed yesterday that they would adopt California's far-reaching program to require cleaner cars in a broad assault against smog in urban America.
Some of the states have already banded together to require less-polluting gasoline, but the move on cars would be the largest joint step against pollution that they have ever taken, proponents say. 
 Most if not all the states can adopt the standards through administrative procedures, experts said, although in some cases the legislatures may take action themselves.
 
Signers of Agreement
 After months of study and debate, the Governors' representatives met in Philadelphia to approve an agreement in which the states pledge to enforce the program, which requires new equipment on gasoline-powered automobiles bought late in this decade, and then the sale of growing numbers of cars that run on alternative fuels like natural gas and methanol. By 1999, 2 percent of the cars sold in areas with the California rules will have to be battery-powered, rising to 5 percent in 2001 and 10 percent in 2003.
Signers of the agreement yesterday are New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Delaware, New Hampshire and Maine. Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont asked for more time to consider the measure. But proponents expect Rhode Island and Vermont to follow soon, and they believe that Connecticut, the only state to express significant reluctance yesterday, will eventually sign on too.
But in Connecticut, officials said they were still studying whether the same benefits could be obtained at lower cost by changes in gasoline formulation, better annual inspection of cars, new equipment in gasoline stations to recapture fumes released in refueling and similar steps.
The states that have pledged to adopt the California standards differ in their progress. New York has completed public hearings and is now in a public comment period, with the Department of Environmental Conservation expecting to issue final regulations soon. In Massachusetts, the Legislature has instructed environmental officials to adopt the standards, and hearings will be held today in Springfield and tomorrow in Boston.
Environmental officials in New Jersey are preparing a regulation and planning to hold hearings in January. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Robert P. Casey directed agencies there to adopt California regulations by the fall of 1995.
Maine plans to issue proposed regulations in January, with public hearings the next month, said Michael Bradley, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a Boston-based association. Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon of Washington and the Governors of New Hampshire and Delaware first committed themselves yesterday, he said. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia committed himself this week, and the issue may also be taken up by Virginia's General Assembly.
A bill to adopt the California standards was approved by the lower house of the Maryland Legislature last year but did not reach the Senate floor. Gov. William Donald Schaefer favored that bill and and is proposing a new legislative effort.
 
Study in Connecticut
 Mr. Bradley said New Hampshire and Vermont planned to submit the matter to their legislatures. In Connecticut, the General Assembly has already passed a law that instructs the Department of Environmental Protection to provide a study of the costs and benefits, but the same law enables the department to adopt the standard itself, Mr. Bradley said.
Because of the nature of smog, formed over many hours by the interaction of sunlight and pollutants, the quality of the air in any given location is often determined by what is emitted across a state line, rather than what is emitted locally.
The states were also apprehensive about enforcing standards that were substantially stricter than their neighbors, for fear that auto makers would stop selling some models in their borders or raise costs excessively. The agreement by so many states makes it all the more certain that the rules will go into effect.
Proponents say the cost for cars that meet the California standard will be under $200 each, but auto makers have estimated that the cost could be $1,000. In the mid-1990 model years, the California auto standards will not be much stricter than the Federal standard.
Assuming that the three holdouts follow, the California regulations would cover an area where more than one-third of the nation's population lives.
The states are promising to act under authority they were given under the Clean Air Act of 1990. Under that law, California was allowed to write its own rules and the other 49 states can choose between California's standard or the Federal regulations.
The California standard lowers the maximum permissible emissions per mile of hydrocabrons and oxides of nitrogen, two pollutants that react with sunlight to form smog, or, more technically, ozone. California also requires an increasing proportion of "ultra-low emitting vehicles," which would run on something other than gasoline, and then "zero emitting vehicles," or electric cars. These classes of vehicles will require substantial advances in technology.
Yesterday's action represents another in a series of victories by clean-air advocates, who have sidestepped the powerful auto and oil lobbies in Washington and instead slogged through repeated battles in the state capitols.
"It's dramatic," said Thomas C. Jorling, New York's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, in a telephone interview from Philadelphia, where the group met. "This is the bipartisan states taking the hard decisions necessary to produce clean air."
 
Industry Resistance
 The idea of adopting the California standards has been fought bitterly by auto and oil companies. After the meeting yesterday, Susan Sonnenberg, a planning associate for environmental affairs at Mobil Oil, said, "Obviously, we're disappointed."
"We're not sure it's the most cost effective approach," she said.
The oil companies object mainly because they fear that the next step will be adoption of California fuel standards, which are expected to be much stricter than standards the Federal Government will use for polluted areas.
At the Ford Motor Company, Don Buist, director of automotive emissions and fuel economy, said in a statement, "We aren't convinced that standards established for California's unique air quality problems make sense for other states and regions. In any case, the California standards are not finalized, nor is the technical feasibility determined."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Islanders Push Past the New Guys

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, L.I., Oct. 29

 BODY:
Millionaires with spare change to throw around might want to look closely at the investment potential of the expansion-level hockey that was displayed tonight at Nassau Coliseum.
The game featured the San Jose Sharks, a first-year team from the end of the earth, against the Islanders, a 20-year-old team that has regressed in recent years to the ways of to a previous life. 
 It would be a cheap shot to accuse both teams of high-stinking this season, but it is true that the newly revamped Islanders entered the match with a six-game streak without a victory and the injury-weakened Sharks had lost nine in a row.
The result, an 8-4 victory for the Islanders, was hardly a work of art, but at least it was mildly entertaining for the 8,969 fans who saw the home team score four unanswered goals in the third period to break a 4-4 tie.
Many of the fans spent much of their time reacting to the score of the Rangers' game flashed on the board over center ice when they weren't cheering the contributions of the six new Islanders. Of the newcomers, five scored and the other contributed two assists.
"They all chipped in," said Coach Al Arbour. "They all got involved."
But the Islanders, who took the second period off, might not have defeated many established teams. The league plans to add two expansion teams next season and four more by the year 2000. If the dilution of talent continues at the current pace, the new teams might be of big-league caliber by the year 3000. By that time, inflation will have made the $50 million entry fee seem like a bargain.
"I don't regard us an expansion team; we're one of 22," said George Kingston, coach of the Sharks. "The players came to the rink believing we could win. We have to keep the spirit. It's important to play with a league mentality. In the final analysis, the rest of the teams don't really give you a lot of assistance to be successful."
 
King on the Move
 Derek King scored twice for the Isles, bringing his season total to nine, the most on the team. Scoring once each were Adam Creighton, Benoit Hogue, Dave McLlwain, Steve Thomas and Pierre Turgeon, all acquired in the trades last Friday with Chicago and Buffalo.
The other newcomer, Uwe Krupp, contributed two assists. New York's David Chyzowski also scored his first goal of the season and displayed some spirited checking. It may have been his best game in parts of three seasons with the team.
Two other apparant Islanders' goals, by Patrick Flatley, were disallowed because they had men in the crease, leading to interference penalties.
The Sharks played without several of their better players, out with injuries: Doug Wilson, Tony Hrkac, Kelly Kisio, Brian Hayward and Jason Moore.
This was the fourth game of a seven-game road trip. The Sharks did bring their popular new uniforms of Pacific teal green with black trim. The style is very popular with fans who wear such things, although one must wonder about a team that uses a broken hockey stick as part of its logo. The stick is in the mouth of the shark, who is biting it on the front of the shirts. The Coliseum organist acknowledged the visitors by playing the theme from the film "Jaws."
The Islanders led by 3-2 after one period and the game was tied at 4-4 after two after the Sharks caught up from a 4-2 deficit.
San Jose's third goal was scored by Wayne Presley, who slapped the puck from the left boards and into the net off the glove of the goaltender.
The Sharks' fourth goal was scored on a rebound by Paul Fenton while Glenn Healy was flat on his back in what appeared to be an exaggerated attempt to force the referee to call an interferance penalty. San Jose's first two goals were scored by Brian Mullen, the former Ranger, and Dean Evason.

Battle of the Sexes
Deborah ("You Just Don't Understand") Tannen meets Robert ("Iron John") Bly in a face-to-face, word-to-word confrontation this Friday at 8 P.M., and tickets to the event at Cooper Union's Great Hall have been sold out for weeks. 
 Under ordinary circumstances, a debate between a linguistics professor and a poet would hardly have people stampeding to the box office, but gender anxiety is apparently running deep in the country these days, and the two best-selling authors of treatises on what makes men and women tick differently have become virtual cult heroes. This will be the first time the two writers face off publicly.
The event, sponsored by the New York Open Center at Cooper Union, was advertised only in Cooper Union's lecture series catalogue. But within a week after the catalogue was mailed, every ticket, at $10, had been sold, and thousands of requests continue to flood the office.
Those who can't get in might want to read the books (hers is from William Morrow in hard back and from Ballantine in paperback; his is from Addison-Wesley), or laugh off the whole phenomenon with a new parody by Alfred Gingold satirizing both Mr. Bly's book and "Fire in the Belly," another best-selling examination of men by Sam Keen. Mr. Gingold's book, from St. Martin's Press, is called "Fire in the John."
 
Yeltsin Seeks Bids
 American publishers have received an invitation from Andrew Nurenberg, a London literary agent, to submit bids for a book by his client, Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Federated Republic and the hero of the masses who defeated the coup in August. The deadline for submitting a bid is midday today, and in his letter, Mr. Nurenberg indicated that seven figures would not be inappropriate since that is what European publishers have already paid for the book, Mr. Yeltsin's memoirs of the coup.
Executives at several major publishing houses said that given the suggestion of a million-dollar-plus offer, their R.S.V.P. would be "No, thank you." Some said that they would send in low bids, figuring that none of their American colleagues were likely to offer Mr. Yeltsin anywhere near what their European colleagues allegedly paid, and that they might then just walk away with the book for a decent price.
"It's not even to be considered at that level," said Alberto Vitale, chairman, president and chief executive officer at Random House Inc., who said he had been negotiating for the book with Mr. Nurenberg.
Adding to the hesitation about buying the Yeltsin book for such big dollars is the fact that the invitation to bid on it includes a caveat that Mr. Yeltsin will be unavailable to promote the book. "Frankly, I don't expect him to; he has a country to run," Mr. Vitale said. But while understanding his situation, many publishers agreed that Mr. Yeltsin's boisterous personality would be an advantage in trying to sell such a book to an American audience usually reluctant to buy books on foreign affairs.
The high advance Mr. Yeltsin and his agent are seeking is indicative of a trend among Soviet officials who have been shopping their own books about town, asking for what publishers across the board agree are unrealistically high advances.
"If the line forms for sugar on the left, the line forms for memoirs on the right," said Peter Osnos, vice president and associate publisher at Random House Adult Trade and publisher of Times Books, a division of Random House Inc. Mr. Osnos, who is also a former Moscow correspondent for The Washington Post, said it seemed to have become a badge of authenticity for Soviet officials "to prove that they are democrats by having a book contract in America."
The common fee being asked by mid-level, barely known apparatchiks is $100,000, apparently a magical sum that the would-be authors seem to have cottoned to almost uniformly. At the current black market rate, $100,000 fetches five million rubles in Moscow.
 
Greenbacks for Hard Backs
 The Soviet people may be hungry for basics like grain and meat this winter, but they apparently will not be starved for American books. While some Soviet officials were pleading with leaders of the industrialized nations for food aid for the coming months, other Soviet officials were at the Frankfurt Book Fair, cutting deals with American publishers to buy books from them for dollars.
In years past, Soviet publishers would buy the rights to reprint American books for rubles, which are illegal to export and are practically worthless, even in the country. When the authors visit Moscow, the Soviet publishers assured their American counterparts, they will have bank accounts flush with rubles.
This year, for the first time, the Americans insisted on concluding their deals in dollars, and crumbling economy and long lines at home notwithstanding, the Soviet officials complied.
A sampling from the Soviet shopping list: Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk" and Isaac Asimov's "Nemesis" from Doubleday, 15 accounting textbooks from Houghton Mifflin and they are still negotiating for several John Updike books from Alfred A. Knopf.
 
Suddenly Fiction
 It is fairly common for a book that makes it onto the hard-cover best-seller list to land on the paperback list as well. What is virtually unheard of is for a book to jump from nonfiction to fiction.
But on Nov. 10, The New York Times Book Review will shift "The Education of Little Tree" to fiction after its 19 weeks on the nonfiction paperback best-seller list.
The book, originally published in 1976, was purportedly the childhood memoirs of an orphaned American Indian named Forrest Carter. But Mr. Carter, who died in 1979, has been widely accused of being a white supremacist named Asa Carter, who forged his credentials as an American Indian.
The controversy over Mr. Carter's credentials was renewed this year when the book made its way onto the paperback best-seller list. Mr. Carter's widow recently confirmed her husband's true identity, which he had denied.
The University of New Mexico Press, which reissued the book in 1986 as a trade paperback and has sold some 340,000 copies of it this year, has also decided that "The Education of Little Tree" is more literature than autobiography. "We're removing the words 'true story' from the cover," said Elizabeth Hadas, director of the publishing house. "Regardless of what he did as an adult, when we found out that he wasn't really an orphan, we decided it probably was not a good idea to say it was a true story. We're now just saying it's a book."

It's Official! Yankees Put Showalter at the Helm

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Twenty-two days after he was dumped onto baseball's rapidly growing unemployment line, Buck Showalter was hired back yesterday and given a superior position as the new manager of the Yankees.
After the Yankees turned left and right and scratched their heads while searching for someone to replace Stump Merrill, they settled on the man who coached at third base for the last two years and has been affiliated with the organization since he was 21 years old. Excluding the last three weeks, of course. 
 In signing a one-year contract, the 35-year-old Showalter became the youngest manager in the majors and the youngest for the Yankees since 1914. The move left Gene Michael groping for words, for the Yankee general manager had said the next manager would have major league experience. When he was asked if Showalter had been his first choice, Michael chirped, "He is now."
It was quickly apparent why the Yankees' limited partners made a smart move on Oct. 18, when they strongly suggested to Michael that he consider Showalter ahead of retread candidates like Doug Rader and Hal Lanier. At yesterday's news conference at Yankee Stadium, the new manager looked polished while discussing what the club must do to avoid losing 90 games for the third straight season.
 
'Winning Takes Care of a Lot'
 "I have thoughts about what went wrong here," said Showalter. "But you keep getting back to the Al Davis theory. Just win. Winning takes care of a lot."
Showalter appeared to say all the right things and made an uncomfortable situation comfortable for all parties. He even said Michael had done him a favor by letting him go as coach because he could then entertain the calls that came from other teams.
Seattle interviewed Showalter for the Mariners' manager's post, which was filled by hiring Bill Plummer yesterday, and three other teams spoke to Showalter about coaching positions. But 11 days after Michael told Showalter to look elsewhere, the Yankee executives told Michael what to do and started a process that turned Showalter into the 20th Yankee manager since 1973, including the multiple terms of Billy Martin, Lou Piniella, Bob Lemon and Michael himself.
"There wasn't any doubt that this is where I wanted to be," said Showalter, who was accompanied by his 4-year-old daughter, Allie, and his wife, Angela, who is seven months pregnant. "There is no one in this room who feels any better vibes about the organization than me."
Though the Yankees seemed to make the correct choice, problems may still exist. The club did not express much faith in Showalter by giving him a one-year contract worth about $225,000, but the new manager tried turning the touchy topic into a positive.
"I'm on a one-year contract," Showalter said. "That means we're on a one-year plan."
Michael claimed the one-year contract was an organizational policy and did not believe it was an issue, saying that was what the club "gave the last two guys." Both Merrill and Bucky Dent, the last two guys, are no longer around.
 
Conflict and Confusion
 The Yankees remain a team immersed in conflict and confusion. Since Showalter was not Michael's choice, the relationship may be troubling. The limited partners stripped away Michael's first chance to hire a manager and put him under the microscope. How will Michael deal with another manager who was not his selection? He did not defend Merrill, who was also not his hire, when players criticized him last year.
Both the general managing partner, Robert Nederlander, and the chief executive officer, Leonard Kleiman, insisted yesterday Michael was standing on solid footing. Nederlander called Michael, "the best baseball man in the country" and Kleinman said the general manager "had done a wonderful job."
Besides the distractions, the team appears to be stagnating in its crucial off-season plans. Michael has acknowledged that the club needs at least one starting pitcher, a third baseman and another power hitter, however, he did not unveil a plan yesterday. He did not seem to have one yet.
"It's too early to say," said Michael, when asked if the club would try to sign free agent Bobby Bonilla. "We have to sit down and decide who we are going to pursue. We have to figure out our number one and two needs."
Showalter said his first needs include assembling a coaching staff in the next week. Chris Chambliss is a possibility as the first-base coach, either Mark Connor or Billy Connors could return as pitching coach and Marc Hill may be back as the bullpen coach.
The new skipper also plans to call each player a few times during the off season and he said Don Mattingly was one of the first he would contact. The two were teammates in the minors and Showalter said he wants the captain to remain part of the team. Mattingly has expressed doubt about whether he wants to play in New York.
"We want him to be a positive force on this club," Showalter said. "He has been and will be again."
Showalter may conveniently forget to tell Mattingly what he did before flying to New York yesterday. He went out and got a haircut.

Mideast Tricks or Treaties?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
It just doesn't seem possible that President Bush and Secretary of State Baker will wander into the historic Mideast peace conference today without a supersecret game plan. Too much can go wrong too quickly with them left holding the bag of blame. The whole initiative could capsize in six months if Washington simply sat back and waited for the right conditions to ripen.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker, whatever they are telling the world to lower expectations, must have a plan. And given their preoccupation with growing Syrian military power, it is likely to be aimed principally at cooling the one conflict that could spark a new Mideast war -- the hatred between Israel and Syria. The plan that fits the pattern of Bush-Baker thinking would call for three small steps to show quick results well short of peace: 
 * A freeze on new Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, brought about by an enticing collage of carrots and sticks. The goal here is to prove to all early on that the process can work.
* A deal for limited Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories, with the amount of self-rule to be set by how much Israelis will swallow in one gulp. The more autonomy the better to help local Palestinian leaders build a power base independent of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
* An Israeli-Syrian territorial agreement on the Golan Heights and/or in Lebanon. This makes it easier for the Palestinians to make compromises on autonomy, and clears the way for Damascus to join regional talks on arms and economic development -- areas of great importance to Israel and the U.S.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker would not want to show their hand before January or February. Acting too soon would relieve all the parties from coming forward with credible proposals of their own and put the full burden of success or failure on the U.S. But waiting too long has problems too. The window of opportunity cannot stay open beyond the summer, when election campaigns begin in Israel and the U.S.
Mr. Bush has special worries here. If he ends up in a tight Presidential race, the Jewish vote could become very important in big states. So come fall, he must be long finished with whatever Israeli arm-twisting he has to do.
His hope, however, would be to make a freeze on settlements so attractive to Israel that little arm-twisting is necessary. He will not ask Israel to stop expanding existing settlements, just to suspend building new ones. And he will call on Arabs to reciprocate by suspending the trade boycott and the Palestinian uprising.
He would sweeten the pot further for Israel with a monster package of loan guarantees to help Soviet immigrants. That would consist of $10 billion in guarantees from the U.S. and perhaps another $10 billion from the Germans, Japanese and others. Prime Minister Shamir will not find it easy to reject this bundle when he thinks about his own elections.
Nor should Palestinians and Israelis find step two, the autonomy deal, to be beyond their reach. They could agree quickly on transferring a host of governmental functions to the Palestinians. The tricky parts will include deciding who can run in local Palestinian elections, and what the residual policing authority of the Israeli military will be.
Steps one and two mainly help Israelis and Palestinians, the fanatics aside. Step three, defusing Israeli-Syrian tensions, takes care of U.S. strategic interests in reducing the risks of Mideast war and curtailing the proliferation of nuclear and chemical arms and long-range missiles.
Israel will not consider returning the Golan Heights to Syria for many years, and Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker will not ask for the impossible. Instead, the U.S. will look for gestures. One might be to take a sliver of the heights and put it under U.S. control. Another might be to arrange partial withdrawals of Syrian and Israeli forces from Lebanon as local militias are disarmed.
What is most attractive about the likely U.S. plan is that it requires neither political miracles nor serious military risks. Neither President Assad of Syria nor Mr. Shamir has to reverse basic policies. This plan would not trick the parties into dangerous illusions of peace, but convince all but the fanatics that a peace process just might work.

HEADLINE: Russian Judges Want Real Justice

BYLINE: By Stephen Breyer; Stephen Breyer is chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Twelve days before he called for sweeping economic changes, Boris Yeltsin addressed the first congress of Russian judges in Moscow. At the gathering of 535 judges, the President of the Russian republic declared his desire to restructure its legal system.
The gap between these hopes and reality was painfully clear. As the judges confirmed, they have been seen as little more than low-level servants of the Communist Party. The success of Mr. Yeltsin's programs will require a drastic transformation in judicial temperament and in public perception of the judiciary. 
 The West can help. We can offer experience and expertise in the ways of an independent judiciary. France and Germany have already agreed to provide opportunities for the Russian judiciary to study their legal systems. The U.S., with the help of its bar associations, foundations and law schools, should do the same.
The judges discussed how Russia has been a society without law. The party, the prosecutors and the police, not the judges, controlled the criminal process. The police and prosecutors could arrest suspects and hold them in detention without trial for months, even years. When a case did go to court, the prosecutors had the upper hand.
Armed with the power to appeal and the greater prestige of their jobs, prosecutors could remind judges that judges and prosecutors were on the same side, representing the "state" or the "people." Guilt or innocence sometimes depended on what the judges called the "telephone connection" -- the call from the local party official dictating the case's outcome.
Judges complied largely because they needed the party for food, housing and their children's educations. Paid less than a third the salary of unskilled laborers, the judges had no real independence. As one judge put it, judges cannot be independent "if we have to ask the local bosses for each brick, for each can of paint, for each rusty nail." Another judge said that recent polls showed that the judiciary has the confidence of only 10 percent of the public.
Mr. Yeltsin offered three specific changes that would bring the rule of law back to the Russian state. He called for an independent judiciary that would be an equal third branch of government. The judiciary would be strengthened by immediate salary increases and by lengthy terms of office with safeguards against removal. Mr. Yeltsin had already turned Communist Party buildings in Russia over to the judiciary for use as courts.
Mr. Yeltsin also urged that judges, not prosecutors, take control of the criminal process. Judges would oversee the legality of arrests and exclude illegally obtained evidence from trials. Judges would review the legality of any confinement. Defendants would also gain the right to meaningful representation by counsel, to trial by a Western-style jury and to an appeal of a conviction.
Finally, Mr. Yeltsin proposed the formation of a constitutional court, something like our Supreme Court. The judges, appointed for life, would have the power to hold statutes unconstitutional.
Can these proposals succeed? The Russian Parliament has not yet enacted the reforms. Some are tentative; some are simply nonspecific goals. Many cost money, which is scarce in this time of budget deficits and inflation in Russia.
The reforms may also meet local resistance; in fact, one judge said that when she asked local party officials for use of the party building, they not only refused but locked her out of her old courthouse as well.
The reformers seemed to recognize the obstacles they face. Yet they will make the effort. Explaining why judicial reform is as important as economic reform, Minister of Justice Nikolai Fyodorov said, "If Russia has to choose between a constitution and sturgeon with horseradish, she must choose the constitution. Besides, it will make a very fine wrapping for the sturgeon with horseradish."
We should do our part to aid the Russians in creating a new judiciary. We should bring them here to study. Soon, Russia would have several hundred officials, each with an understanding of a Western system.
A co-equal judicial branch and a system of constitutional review, which lie at the heart of the proposed Russian reforms, are central to our own system of government. For this reason alone, Americans bear a special responsibility to join in the efforts to help create an independent, nonpolitical judiciary in Russia.

HEADLINE: Yields on C.D.'s and Bank Funds Off Slightly for Week

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and bank money market accounts dropped slightly in the last week, but there are prospects of a much sharper fall in coming weeks, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication that covers interest rates.
"This week's modest decline in savings yields should accelerate quickly as the Federal Reserve moves to ease rates. Negative economic news will force the Federal Reserve to cut its discount rate and the banks to trim their prime rate," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, said yesterday. 
 "There already is leeway for a quarter-point cut in the prime rate based on the fact that the banks' cost of funds has dropped by 33 basis points since the prime last came down on Sept. 13." Mr. Heady added. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
He noted that the First Fidelity Bank of New Jersey yesterday lowered its prime from 8 percent to 7.75 percent.
The week's largest cut in yields in money market funds among New York-area banks was at Astoria Federal Savings, which dropped its money market yield 42 basis points to 4.59 percent.
The People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn., cut the yield on its three-month certificates of deposit by 11 basis points to 5.02 percent, while Midlantic of Edison, N.J., raised the yield on its six-month certificate by 15 basis points to 5.55 percent.
At New York commercial banks, the average yield on money market accounts was cut to 4.64 percent, down 2 basis points, while the average yields on three-month and six-month certificates were 4.83 percent and 4.92 percent, respectively, each off a basis point.
At savings institutions in the New York area, yields on money market accounts were cut to 5.18 percent, down 5 basis points; 5.27 percent for three-month certificates, down 3 basis points, and 5.49 percent for six-month certificates, down 2 basis points.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields on money market accounts at 20 big banks outside the New York area were cut by 4 basis points, to 4.83 percent, and by 3 basis points, to 5.10 percent, on six-month certificates.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly bill auction onMonday the three-month bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 4.99, compared with 5.04 a week earlier.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Senate Race Tightens

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa., Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Harris Wofford campaign scheduled a tour at a hospital here to promote the Senate candidate's major issue, a call for national health insurance. But so many television crews showed up to quench the state's growing thirst for information about this little-known Democrat that the candidate had to make the tour twice.
Viewers got to see Mr. Wofford, accompanied by his actor friend, Mike Farrell, who played B. J. Hunnicutt on the television series "M*A*S*H." The two chatted with new mothers, and Mr. Wofford said things like, "I hope that when Ashley grows up she'll have national health insurance." 
 He has apparently picked a popular issue, one that could significantly influence voters in their choice for the man best able to serve out the remaining three years of the late Senator John Heinz's term. In a statewide survey released today, 94 percent of the Pennsylvanians polled said that "making sure that everyone is able to receive adequate health care" was an important factor in helping them make that decision. And nationally, Democratic governors and leaders in Congress agreed today to push for a program that would guarantee access to health care.
That survey, conducted by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and WTAE-TV of Pittsburgh, spelled trouble for Dick Thornburgh, the 59-year-old Republican candidate, who opposes national health insurance. He dismissed the idea as too expensive and too complicated.
The poll found that Mr. Thornburgh, a popular two-term Pennsylvania Governor who had a troubled tenure as the United States Attorney General, has lost his commanding lead over Mr. Wofford, a 65-year-old former college president and aide to President John F. Kennedy who was appointed as interim Senator in May. Indeed, the poll found that the two candidates are now in a virtual dead heat a week from Election Day.
"Should the trend depicted in the poll continue," the Post-Gazette said today, "this Senate race will be remembered as one of the most startling upsets in recent Pennsylvania politics."
The poll, based on telephone interviews with 738 registered voters around the state from Thursday through Sunday, also showed that Mr. Wofford made sharp gains among almost all demographic groups, including Republicans. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Another poll released today, by KYW-TV in Philadelphia, found that amid rising concern over the economy and health care, Mr. Thornburgh's lead stands at five percentage points in a poll of 810 registered voters with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The poll was conducted by telephone from Saturday through Monday.
The Thornburgh campaign dismissed the results of the polls as conflicting with their own, which they say shows Mr. Thornburgh with a 12-percentage-point lead. The campaign predicts Mr. Thornburgh will win by 6-point margin. "We're not running scared, absolutely not," said Michelle Davis, Mr. Thornburgh's campaign manager.
This unexpectedly close campaign, the only Senate race in the nation this year, is sounding national themes and setting the stage for national elections next year. Pennsylvania, which has not sent a Democrat to the Senate in 30 years, has become a kind of test market for Democratic and Republican campaign ideas.
And Mr. Wofford, who is running his first race for elected office, is clearly giving the Democrats some good pointers for 1992. He has shown that national health insurance has finally matured as a popular, vote-getting issue after it had apparently died along with the 1988 Presidential aspirations of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who ineffectively promoted the issue.
Some political analysts say Mr. Wofford is also demonstrating the vulnerability of President Bush's domestic policies. They say he has severely wounded Mr. Thornburgh by linking him to unpopular Bush Administration policies, like Mr. Bush's veto of legislation to extend unemployment benefits.
 
Handling of S.& L. Crisis
 Mr. Wofford has also attacked the Administration's and Mr. Thornburgh's handling of other issues that touch a raw nerve with voters. The Wofford campaign advertisements, for example, contain blistering condemnations of Mr. Thornburgh's prosecution of the savings and loan scandal and accuse him of a conflict of interest for failing to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Neil Bush, the President's son, for his role as a director of a failed savings and loan.
Mr. Thornburgh, put on the defensive from the outset, may have spent more time denying allegations than he has spent in defining his campaign, one based on his record as governor. Nor has he been able to present a stirring vision of what he would do as senator. He has talked about bringing jobs to Pennsylvania by developing abandoned industrial sites for commercial uses, for example, but he has waffled on whether he would support a trade agreement with Mexico that is widely considered detrimental to the state's remaining manufacturing jobs.
"Advertising is going to decide this race," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a specialist in political communications and dean of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. And Mr. Thornburgh is losing the advertising competition, she said. "If you knew nothing about either candidate except what you see in the ads, you would think that Thornburgh has been tied to everything you didn't like about George Bush and that Wofford was tied to Governor Casey's unpopular tax increase. But Wofford is also running a gutsy, one-issue positive ad campaign on health care insurance, and Thornburgh doesn't have anything that articulates his sense of the future."
David Buffington, a Republican and editor of the politically neutral Pennsylvania Report, a political newsletter, predicted last Friday that Mr. Wofford would win the race.
"The candidates' negative campaigning has done what negative campaigning is supposed to do: produce a large number of undecided voters," he said. "We asked ourselves, 'Which campaign is strategically and logistically better able to capture these undecided voters?' And we're convinced it's the Wofford campaign."
Major media endorsements for Mr. Wofford have been pouring in from Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, while Mr. Thornburgh has only been able to capture endorsements in smaller cities like Erie, York and Lancaster. The Patriot-News, Harrisburg's only daily newspaper and one that almost always endorses Republicans in statewide races, caused the most stir with its unexpected endorsement of Mr. Wofford.
"It came down to a case of whether you want a candidate who was going to address some problems we have in the country or somebody who will defend the status quo," Herb Field, author of the editorial, said in an interview.
Philadelphia's popular all-news radio station, KYW-AM, left the choice up to its listeners. But Mr. Wofford himself could not have framed the choice more to his liking. "Basically," the station said, "this race boils down to whether you like President Bush's policies for Pennsylvania and the nation, or whether you want a change."

American Tobacco Has New President

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
American Brands Inc. has appointed Donald S. Johnston president and chief operating officer of its American Tobacco Company, which sells such well-known cigarettes as Tareyton, Pall Mall and Carlton.
The title of president had been held by Charles H. Mullen, who continues as the company's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Johnston had been the executive vice president for sales at American Tobacco. 
 The company's parent, American Brands, is a consumer products company that also does business in distilled spirits like Gilbey's gin and vodka, hardware and home-improvement products, office products and insurance.
American Tobacco, based in Stamford, Conn., has annual sales of more than $1.6 billion and is No. 5 in the industry.
Analysts said the company is generally doing well, despite the slump in the domestic tobacco industry. But they said its market share could shrink during the next several years if it does not breathe some life into its venerable brands like Pall Mall.
"American Tobacco's core brands are aimed at older smokers who have been quitting smoking more rapidly than their younger counterparts," said Ronald Morrow, an analyst at Smith Barney. "The challenge is to stimulate growth by attracting consumers in the 25- to 40-year-old segment."
Mr. Morrow said American Tobacco had been successful in the highly competitive low-priced cigarette market with its Bull Durham and Montclair. "The growth this year has been at the lower-priced end," he said. The brands accounted for about 30 percent of the company's unit volume during the last quarter, compared with 17 percent for the same period last year.
Like its competitors, American Tobacco has been plagued by high-profile lawsuits charging that tobacco companies are liable for cancer caused by smoking. The company has one suit pending.
Mr. Johnston, who is 53 years old, joined American Tobacco in 1986 as executive sales director. Before that he worked for 19 years in a variety of executive positions at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, which markets Kool and and other cigarettes.
He received a degree in marketing and economics from Northeastern University. He also has an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California.
He lives in Shelton, Conn., with his wife, Betty, and their two sons, Brian and Bruce.

Some Delta Debt Gets Lower Rating

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's Corporation yesterday downgraded its rating on $2.2 billion of Delta Air Lines senior debt.
While lowering the rating to BBB+ from A-, S.& P. also canceled its credit watch on Delta, which was issued on Aug. 16. The airline's $950 million worth of equipment trust certificates, which cover many of its planes, were also downgraded to A- from A. S.& P. noted that Delta had acquired Pan American World Airways' European routes and shuttle when its own earnings were under pressure because of the weak economy. 
 S.& P. said Delta's rating outlook was stable, however. "Delta reamins one of the strongest U.S. airlines financially, benefiting from a solid competitive position, modern fleet, positive labor relations and a good service reputation," the ratings agency said.

Dollar Tumbles as Fed Lets A Key Interest Rate Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday after the Federal Reserve allowed a key short-term interest rate to decline.
Gold prices slipped domestically after rising overseas. 
 The dollar fell in early trading amid pessimism about the economy. But it slid further when the Fed let the Federal funds rate, an indicator of the central bank's monetary policy, fall to 5 percent from 5.25 percent.
 
Timing Is Surprise
 Traders interpreted the move as a change in Fed policy. They were surprised, reasoning that the Fed should have waited at least until Friday's release of October employment data before acting to stimulate the economy.
"The move itself wasn't a big surprise, the timing was," said Mike Faust, a currency analyst for MMS International Inc. in New York.
Lower interest rates reduce the value of American investments, thereby squelching demand for the dollar.
Some traders began selling dollars even before the Fed funds rate fell, believing a Fed move was increasingly likely in light of recent economic data.
A Commerce Department report yesterday that new-home sales fell 12.9 percent in September added to the pessimism. That followed release of a Conference Board survey on Tuesday showing consumer confidence plunged to recessionary levels in October.
 
Yen Also Hurt
 The dollar closed down against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, which has been hurt by fears that the new Japanese Government might also lower interest rates.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.80 yen, to a closing 131.05 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at the same rate. In New York, the dollar closed at 131.05 yen, up from late Tuesday's 130.60.
In London, the pound rose to $1.7425 from $1.7230 late Tuesday. Sterling also climbed in New York, closing at $1.7440, compared with $1.7290 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Business and the Law;
Holding Directors Liable for Losses

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder

 BODY:
LITIGATION accusing corporate directors of negligence and other misconduct is fairly common in the United States, so it would be unthinkable for someone to accept a director's post if an American company did not carry insurance as protection from lawsuits.
But this is not so in Israel, where the first significant case is unfolding in which damages are being sought from directors for failing to prevent the financial looting of their company. 
 The special twist, though, is that the directors being sued include wealthy foreign investors, among them several prominent Americans. These directors were among the foreign investors recruited in 1977 to supply about two-thirds of the capital to convert a small Jerusalem bank into the commercially oriented North American Bank.
The foreign directors say that they were encouraged by Israeli financial authorities to leave the management of the bank to Israelis and that the suit is a betrayal of their willingness to respond to the country's pleas for financial support.
"The message is that if you lend your name to anything in Israel, you can no longer be sure that some lawyer and court won't come after you with huge liabilities," said Nathan Lewin, a Washington lawyer who is representing Erwin Sussman and the estate of the late Ira Guilden in a countersuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The countersuit accuses the Israeli Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Israel and Bank Hapoalim Ltd. of scheming to mislead the foreign directors about the condition of North American Bank during Israel's 1983 banking crisis and with subsequently covering up their actions.North American Bank had six branches in Israel and an office in New York, and was on the verge of becoming Israel's second merchant bank when the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange crashed in 1983. To bail out the banking system, Israel nationalized many banks and paid the equivalent of billions of dollars to shareholders.
But North American was not among those rescued in such a straightforward fashion. Instead, according to the counterclaim, the Bank of Israel gave $10 million to Bank Hapoalim, which then lent the money to North American through Hapoalim's New York branch. The suit charges that the intent was to allow North American's officials to buy enough stock to keep the price up, thus reassuring investors and helping the Bank of Israel avoid the cost of adding North American to its bailout list.
The countersuit contends that the Hapoalim loan simply allowed North American Bank officials who were embezzling the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars to continue to do so. Moreover, the countersuit contends, Israeli authorities were aware of the criminal activity and made no move to stop it or warn stockholders until August 1985, when the Bank of Israel took control of North American Bank's operations. The bank was put into bankruptcy in 1988 and four of its officers have been convicted of crimes.
The Israeli lawsuit, begun in 1989 by Yosef Segev, a lawyer chosen by the bank's receiver, seeks damages of 135 million shekels -- or about $56 million -- from 24 defendants. The foreign directors are being cited for negligence and other defendants for more serious misconduct. But the suit seeks to make each defendant fully liable for all of the damages. Mr. Segev asserts that the directors' names helped lure depositors to the bank and that many of them had financial dealings and investments with the bank.
The trial in Israel was adjourned this summer and is scheduled to resume on Nov. 13. The Israeli defendants in the countersuit are challenging the Federal court's jurisdiction, an issue that will probably not be decided before early next year.
In addition to Mr. Sussman and the Guilden estate, foreign defendants include David Goan of Switzerland, whose family is prominent in Jewish organizations; Joel Herzog, Mr. Goan's brother-in-law and the son of Chaim Herzog, the President of Israel; Joseph Nakash, the founder of the Jordache clothing empire, and Norman Allan, a wealthy investor from Birmingham, Mich.
Mr. Sussman invested nearly $2 million in the bank, which he lost along with almost $1 million more in investments recommended by the bank's officers. He said he and the Guilden estate had spent nearly $2 million on lawyers so far.
Ira Guilden, who died in 1984 at the age of 89, played a central role in recruiting the foreign investors for North American Bank and served as chairman. Paul Guilden, Ira Guilden's son and executor, said no one involved could have interpreted his father's role as chairman as anything other than an honorary one. "He didn't even speak Hebrew," Mr. Guilden said.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Tax-Free Fund Rates Up; Taxables Are Off

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt money market funds tended to move up again slightly for the week that ended yesterday, while yields on taxable funds continued to decline, according to IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and issues The Money Fund Report.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, reported that total assets of the tax-exempt funds declined a slight $36 million, to $89.5 billion for the week. The average days to maturity of holdings in the tax-exempt portfolios dropped by one day, to 60 days. 
 "There are not enough investors out there," Mr. Frank said. "Yields will have to go higher to induce purchases."
As for the taxable market, he said, "yields have been declining in ancticipation of further easing by the Federal Reserve, and if we do get that, we would expect large flows from institutional investors into money market funds to take advantage of the higher yields they afford relative to open-market securities such as commercial paper and bank products."
The seven-day compound average yield for tax-exempt funds rose to 3.94 percent from 3.83 percent a week earlier, while the seven-day simple yield rose to 3.86 percent from 3.76 percent.
For 30-day yields, the compound yield was 4.02, down 11 basis points from 4.13 percent the previous week; the 30-day simple yield declined to 3.94 from 4.05 a week ago, also down 11 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The 30-day yields reflected the declining rates of a few weeks ago, while the seven-day rates tended to reflect the large supply of municipal offerings in the market.
Among state-specific tax-exempt funds, the top New York fund once again was the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.51, compared with 4.40 percent the previous week.
In Connecticut, the leader was the Dreyfus Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, with a yield of 4.32, versus the 4.14 percent posted by the previous week's leader.
Calvert Tax Free Reserves, N.J., led the way in New Jersey once again, with a yield of 4.49 percent, up from 4.41 percent a week ago.
The highest-yielding tax-exempt fund among those with assets greater than $100 million continued to be Strong Municipal Money Market with a yield of 5.01 percent, up from 4.92 the previous week.
Assets of taxable funds, Mr. Frank said, went down by $131 million, to $462.2 billion, for the week. But institutional assets went up by $474 million, so that the outflow was totally on the retail side. "This broadly continues the pattern we have had recently," he said.
Average maturities of portfolio holdings were unchanged, at 63 days. The seven-day compound yield was down by 5 basis points, to 5.10, and the seven-day simple yield for the taxable funds dropped by 5 points, to 4.97 from 5.02 percent.
The average compound 30-day yield was 5.16 percent, down from 5.21, or 5 basis points, and the 30-day simple yield was also down 5 basis points to 5.03 percent.
The top-yielding fund among the taxables once again was the Riverside Capital Money Market Fund of Columbus, Ohio, with a seven-day compound yield of 6.49, up from 6.36 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped 2 basis points, to 4.92 percent from 4.94 percent a week earlier, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Personal Income and Spending Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Consumer spending rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in September, helped by an advance of five-tenths of 1 percent in personal income, the Commerce Department said today.
The report followed by a day the release of a new survey showing consumer confidence plunging to recessionary levels in October, which could portend problems for the recovery, since consumers represent two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
 The Commerce Department said consumer spending totaled $3.86 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from $3.83 trillion in August. The gain was the largest since a rise of 1.1 percent in March. It also was the fifth consecutive gain.
Personal income was at an annual rate of $4.85 trillion, up from $4.82 trillion a month earlier and it matched an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in June. Income slipped two-tenths of 1 percent in July and rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August.
The department reported on Tuesday that consumer spending, when adjusted for inflation, had risen at a 3.8 percent annual rate during the third quarter. It was the largest gain since mid-1989 and helped lift the G.N.P. 2.4 percent at an annual rate, the first quarterly gain in a year.
But later in the day, the business-sponsored Conference Board in New York released a survey showing its index of consumer confidence dropped 12.5 points in October to 60.4 -- a level it considers recessionary.
The difference between incomes and spending meant Americans' savings rate edged down to 3.7 percent from 4.1 in August.
A key component of the income category -- wages and salaries -- rose $12.1 billion, a bit slower than the $12.9 billion the previous month.
The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, spending still advanced six-tenths of 1 percent, wiping out a three-tenths of 1 percent loss in August. Disposable incomes rose two-tenths of 1 percent, the same as the previous month.
Spending on durable goods rose $7.7 billion, after falling $10.6 billion in August.
Spending on non-durable goods like food and fuel dipped $100 million after a $200 million drop a month earlier.
Spending on services jumped $25.6 billion, nearly doubling the $13 billion advance the previous month.

HEADLINE: Energy Bill Is Stirring Debate on Wildlife Areas

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
More than a decade after Congressional passage of a plan to reduce America's dependence on imported oil, the Senate is set to debate another energy proposal with familiar provisions.
At its core, the measure, which is closely modeled after a plan offered earlier this year by the White House, seeks to end the nation's economic vulnerability by clearing the way for the oil industry to drill in sensitive areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and by making it easier for the nuclear industry to build new reactors. 
 To help make such steps politically palatable, the bill includes conservation measures aimed at making appliances and buildings more efficient and requiring some fleets of vehicles to use fuels other than gasoline.
 
Threat of Filibuster
 But the energy bill faces a very difficult path. Democratic leaders and some Republicans said from the start that they would not sponsor the President's energy package; several Democrats said earlier this month that they would stage a filibuster when the version completed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reaches the Senate floor, which could be as early as Thursday.
The dispute that has attracted the most attention is drilling in the Arctic refuge, one of the nation's last wilderness regions. National environmental organizations have staked their reputations and political influence in Congress on blocking any exploration there, saying industrialization would harm a landscape that is almost untouched.
The White House, meanwhile, has been directing a public relations campaign. The Energy and Interior Secretaries urged the bill's passage during news conferences; a White House ceremony was held last week and other public gatherings are scheduled this week.
"There is no silver bullet to solving our energy problems," Senator Macolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming who co-sponsored the energy bill, said at a news conference on Tuesday. "It is inconceivable to me that America will benefit by paying more money into foreign coffers for oil.
Senator Wallop added, "You cannot imagine an energy bill that does not call for some new energy production."
 
Bipartisan Opposition
 Still, several Republicans are not in line. One, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, sponsored the 1980 legislation that established the 19-million-acre Arctic refuge. Members of Senator Roth's staff said he opposes any industrial intrusion in the region.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska and an avid supporter of the bill, argues that environmentalists are being "dishonest" in their arguments about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He argues that only 10,000 to 15,000 acres of the refuge would be affected by the drilling. Improved drilling techniques and new environmental technologies will make exploring for oil in the refuge at least as safe as the industrialization of nearby Prudhoe Bay, where wildlife has been unaffected and the fragile tundra largely unharmed, he said. The risks of environmental damage, he added, are far outweighed by the benefits of gaining oil reserves estimated as high as nine billion barrels.
"Environmentalists are using this issue to build their memberships, using hyperbole to cause fear without any real costs to them," Senator Murkowski said in an interview. "It's a win-win situation for them. Even if the refuge is opened, they can say they were rolled by big oil."
 
An Elemental Debate
 But for national environmental groups and their supporters in the Senate the issue is how far Americans are willing to go to gain the oil. They oppose opening the Arctic refuge to exploration and putting a wild ecosystem in danger of permanent harm to sustain a petroleum-based economy that they view as wasteful and polluting.
Just as in the 1970's, when Congress responded to the Arab oil embargo with a succession of laws to eliminate price controls on petroleum products, establish mandatory fuel-efficiency standards for cars and invest billions of dollars in the development of alternative energy sources, the debate this year essentially involves two competing views of American life.
What is missing, though, say leaders on both sides, is any sense of urgency about the problem. Gasoline prices are stable and low. Oil supplies are ample, and it appears they will be for the foreseeable future, according to energy industry analysts. Thus, while the nation's vulnerability to supply cuts remains unchanged, the public's attention span on the issue is short.
The sponsors of the Senate energy package, including its author, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, are promoting a plan that asks for virtually no change on the part of the American consumer. Senator Johnston and his supporters contend that increasing supplies and some conservation measures are enough to keep energy prices moderate and supplies adequate.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Senator Johnston acknowledged that his bill would not substantially reduce the nation's reliance on imported oil, which accounts for roughly half of the domestic supply. But, he added,, a new study by the Technology Assessment Office, a Congressional research arm, showed that passage of the bill was the only way to keep the reliance on imported oil from getting worse and the only way to keep the nation's economy growing. More than 60 percent of imported oil is used for transportation, mostly in cars and light trucks.
 
Disagreement Among Opponents
 Opponents of the measure differ strongly on what is needed and have a far more optimistic opinion about the number of changes most Americans are willing to make to gain independence from foreign oil. Citing data from surveys and the Energy Department's own internal memorandums on the issue, opponents of the bill say Americans are eager to accept more efficient cars, more efficient buildings and to pay for more research and development on renewable energy supplies.
The Johnston bill, opponents say, achieves none of these objectives, but will fill the coffers of oil companies while ruining the nation's second-largest wildlife refuge, reward inefficiencies in the nuclear industry, drain the Treasury of billions of dollars and do nothing to change the basic structure of the transportation industry.
"It is a comprehensive energy bill," Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat of Minnesota, said on Tuesday. "There's something in it for every oil company."

HEADLINE: Small Stocks in Rally, and Dow Gains 9.84

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday for the third straight trading session, led by a strong rally in small stocks. Blue-chip issues gained modestly, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.84, to 3,071.78.
The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading rose to a record of 541.32, up 6.81 for the day. The Russell 2000 index of small issues also reached a high of 183.35, up 1.45. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 200.8 million shares, up from 192.8 million shares on Tuesday. Gaining issues outpaced losers by 977 to 654.
The Big Board composite index was up 0.90, to 216.48, with the American Stock Exchange composite up 2.57, to 384.18.
 
Dow in Narrow Range
 The Dow moved in a narrow 21-point range thoughout the day, from a low of 3,052.55 to a high of 3,074.02.
"It was wild," said Paul J. Kronlokken, a technical analyst for Piper Jaffrey "The Dow must have made three and a half round trips today as it went from top to bottom."
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trades, said four buy and four sell programs had little impact on the Dow, accounting for only a 0.90-point loss.
Talk of an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve fueled buying. A report that September new- home sales were down a large 12.9 percent suggested that the housing industry might need additional help from the Fed in the form of lower rates.
"We're pretty much near the last batch of earnings reports," Mr. Kronlokken said, so the market is beginning to look more to economic data. October employment and purchasing managers reports are scheduled for Friday.
"There has not been any clear leader in this market, with a lot of internal rotation as investors move from one issue to another," Mr. Kronlokken said.
 
Kellogg Shares Drop
 Kellogg shares fell 3, to 102 1/4. Analysts said investors reacted to the low-double-digit growth forecast that the company's chairman-elect, Arnold Langbo, gave security analysts in New York Tuesday.
Dial slipped 1/2 to 43 3/4 yesterday, but was as high as 45. The company announced plans on Tuesday to restructure, including the spinoff of its commercial lending and mortgage insurance businesses, to concentrate on consumer products like its Dial soap.
Stephen A. Smith, an analyst at Bear Stearns, raised his rating for USX-Marathon to a "strong buy" from "hold." The stock of the oil unit of the USX Corporation rose 7/8, to 29 3/4.
USX was also up 1/8, to 29 3/8, on better-than-expected third quarter results, as was Nucor, a steel company, which was up 1/4, to 80 1/4.
Chrysler was up 1 5/8, to 12 3/4. The auto maker reported a loss yesterday for the quarter, but it was less than expected.
Synergen shares soared 8 3/4, to 55 1/4, as the company's stock split went into effect and investors anticipated the release on Nov. 7 of test results of its drug to treat septic shock.
American Brands rose 1 1/8, to 42, as Allan Kaplan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, upgraded his intermediate rating to "above average," from "neutral." He noted that on Tuesday the company raised its quarterly dividend to 43.75 cents, from 38.5 cents, more than expected.
International Paper was up 1 3/8, to 76 3/4, as Kathryn McAuley, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, repeated a "buy" rating. She cited strong earnings and low debt.

Big Losses At Armco, Bethlehem

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Two big steel companies -- Bethlehem and Armco -- yesterday reported huge losses for the third quarter, while a third, Wheeling-Pittsburgh, reported a drop in sales and a small profit. The companies attributed the results to falling steel prices, higher costs and sagging demand brought on by the recession.
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's second-largest steel producer behind the USX Corporation, said it lost $61 million for the quarter, in contrast to net income of $10 million in the period last year. Armco Inc., which is the nation's fifth-largest steelmaker, said it lost $26.9 million, deeper than the $8.8 million loss in the period last year.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Bethlehem
 Bethlehem's sales slipped in the quarter, to $1.12 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 1990. Walter F. Williams, Bethlehem's chairman and chief executive, said, "Realized prices were lower in all major product lines in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 1991 than in the year-earlier periods, and, on average, were at the severely depressed levels of the early 1980's."
Indeed, steel prices have tumbled in the last year, with steel producers cutting prices to keep market share. As a result, the average price for a ton of hot-rolled sheet steel -- the basic product used in everything from pipes and automobile parts to traffic signs and file cabinets -- has slid on spot markets from $345 at the beginning of last year to about $280 now. And steel buyers have said they could usually get prices that are even slightly lower.
Bethlehem reported an operating loss of $48 million in its basic steel operations, compared with operating income of $27 million for the third quarter of last year. The company said the results were negatively affected by higher labor costs, citing a wage increase that went into effect as part of a pact with the United Steelworkers of America.
In its steel-related operations, which include freight car manufacturing operations and shipbuilding, Bethlehem reported an operating loss of $3 million, compared with $12 million in the year earlier period.
The company, based in Bethlehem, Pa., said it incurred "unusually high operating costs" because of modernization and repair of a coke oven and blast furnace at its mill in Sparrow's Point, Md. The company said it estimated that the work amounted to about $50 million in the third quarter. On the New York Stock Exchange, Bethlehem's shares gained 75 cents, to $15.625.
 
Armco
 Armco said its sales for the quarter dropped to $387.6 million, from $418.1 million in the third quarter of last year. Included in the quarterly loss is an equity loss of $31.9 million from flat-rolled joint venture between Armco, based in Parsippany, N.J., and the Kawasaki Steel Corporation of Japan.
However, Armco said operating income improved to $13.9 million for the quarter, from $3.4 million in the quarter lst year. "This is encouraging," said Robert L. Purdum, Armco's chairman and chief executive. "But continuing softness in the economy concerns us as we look through the first half of next year." Mr. Purdum added that "the near-term outlook for most of Armco's major markets remains weak." Armco's shares lost 12.5 cents, closing at $5.125.
 
Wheeling-Pittsburgh
 The Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, in Wheeling, W. Va., which earlier this year emerged from bankruptcy, reported net income of $392,000, or 2 cents a share. The figure compared with net income of $22.3 million in the comparable period last year. Analysts stressed that the comparisons were not revealing because the company was in bankruptcy. Sales for Wheeling-Pittsburgh, the nation's eighth-largest steel producer, dropped to $244.6 million, from $286.5 million. The company's shares fell 25 cents, to $7.25.

Chrysler's Loss Is Not as Deep as Feared

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation said today that it lost $82 million in the third quarter, significantly less than analysts had predicted. The results touched off strong buying of Chrysler stock, which rose $1.625 to finish at $12.75 on trading of 3.3 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Chrysler's loss was on revenue of $7.5 billion, compared with a loss of $214 million a year ago on revenue of $6.5 billion. For the nine months the auto maker has lost $892 million on revenue of $21.1 billion, compared with a nine-month profit last year of $37 million on revenue of $23 billion. 
 Like General Motors and Ford, Chrysler has suffered during the recession, and its latest losses again stemmed mostly from lower sales of cars and trucks. But Chrysler has been much weaker financially than G.M. and Ford, so the improved results were claimed as a triumph by the company's management.
 
Projections Proved Wrong
 "In the market we're in today, holding losses to $82 million is an outstanding performance and clearly reflects the efficiencies we've gained by restructuring Chrysler into a lean and highly productive company," said Chrysler's Chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, in a statement.
Auto industry analysts had expected Chrysler to lose about $190 million in the period, which is the weakest because of slow production related to the introduction of new models.
Worldwide factory sales of vehicles to dealers, on which revenue and earnings are based, were 453,349 during the third quarter, compared with 412,723 a year ago.
Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, explained that he had forecast large losses based on the number of vehicles Chrysler produced in the period. But, he said, a greater proportion of them than earlier in the year were sold at retail to individual customers, as opposed to rental fleets, yielding a greater profit. Top Chrysler financial executives briefed automotive analysts this morning in New York.
Moreover, Mr. Heinbach said, Chrysler benefited from increased prices on its 1992 model trucks and mini-vans and from aggressive cost-cutting, which executives say has reduced fixed costs by $3 billion in the last two years. Cash incentives to customers averaged about $1,300 a vehicle in the quarter, about the same as last year.
Chrysler's selling, general and administrative costs for the third period fell to $448 million, compared with $465 million. But executives told financial analysts that the number would rise by $50 million in the fourth quarter to pay for heavier-than-normal advertising outlays.
 
More Losses Expected
 Analysts expect Chrysler to lose money again in the fourth quarter, or possibly to break even. On Tuesday, Chrysler told analysts it was cutting 56,000 cars and trucks from its fourth-quarter production schedule because of weak demand. That will lower the quarterly schedule to 501,000 cars and trucks.
Executives also said that the proportion of low-profit fleet sales would rise in the fourth quarter. Fleet sales constituted 16 percent of total sales in the third quarter, compared with 27 percent in the second quarter.
Wendy Needham, an automotive analyst for Smith Barney in New York, said she predicted a "small fourth-quarter loss."
The Chrysler Financial Corporation, the company's finance subsidiary, earned $81 million in the third quarter, compared with $83 million last year.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Post Sharp Drop

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Despite a decent rise in household incomes last month and the lowest mortgage rates in 14 years, sales of new homes fell sharply in September. Since the housing sector has led the way since January in pulling the nation out of recession, economists see the plunge as strong evidence that Americans' confidence in the sluggish recovery is fading.
Home sales plunged 12.9 percent last month, the biggest drop in two and a half years, to their lowest level since the depths of the recession in January, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. 
 "The picture is really, really bleak," said Michael D. Hobbs, a contractor in New Canaan, Conn. "There was a real flurry of activity a few months ago, but that certainly has not been sustained."
 
People Are Nervous
 Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said, "The fact that people aren't willing to lock themselves into 30 years of mortgage payments shows that they're very nervous about layoffs."
Ronald R. Foell, president of Standard Pacific, a home-building company based in Costa Mesa, Calif., said: "Only those people who really need housing or are very secure in their jobs are buying. Everybody else seems to be staying on the sidelines." Mr. Foell's company is one of the lucky few whose sales actually climbed in September.
After a spate of weak economic data, including Tuesday's gloomy consumer confidence report from the Conference Board, the Federal Reserve apparently eased short-term interest rates once more yesterday -- the 11th time it has done so in two years. The move helped to lift the price of short-term securities, but was not as well received among long-term investors. [Page D16.]
 
One of Economy's Supports
 Unless home-buying snaps back soon, the wobbly economy will lose one of its few supports, said Karen Horn, the chief executive of Bank One of Cleveland. More than one-fourth of the summer rise in the gross national product -- 2.4 percent at an annual rate adjusted for inflation -- was a result of a 21 percent spurt in housing starts.
The latest reports suggest that housing will not help the economy much in the fourth quarter. Builders typically start digging foundations, hiring workers and paying suppliers when sales of lived-in and new houses are rising.
Not only have sales of existing homes been dropping for three months, but housing starts had slipped in August and applications for new building permits have slackened.
"The fourth quarter looks bad," said Alan Lerner, managing director at Bankers Trust, "but we're not likely to see another recession." He expects growth to slow to a 1.5 percent or so annual rate this fall compared with 2.4 percent in the summer. "That will feel like a recession."
Sales of new homes fell from 512,000 in August to 446,000 in September, not far above January's deeply depressed level of 414,000. Adding to the picture of weakness, what was originally reported as a strong 6.7 percent gain in August turned out, after a revision, to have been a modest 1.8 percent rise. That leaves September sales a mere 8 percent higher than at the depths of the recession, in contrast to August sales, which were 24 percent higher.
The housing recovery stumbled everywhere. Sales of new homes fell the most in the West and the Northeast, by 16.6 percent and 12.9 percent respectively. But even the South and Midwest, which had been the most buoyant, experienced double-digit declines. Median sales prices slipped to $120,200, down $600 from the previous month. And the inventory of unsold houses on the market, 295,000, or 8.3 months of supply, ended up the highest since January.
 
Mortgage Rates Are Favorable
 Whatever reasons account for the slump in the housing market, Mr. Lerner said, mortgage rates are not one of them. The rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was 8.92 percnet at the end of the month, down from nearly 10.5 percent two years ago.
The housing slump could also dampen consumer spending. Rising housing sales produce all kinds of other consumer outlays from new wall telephones to wall-to-wall carpeting. Other harbingers of spending like confidence and car sales have also looked discouraging. At best, they suggest that consumer spending will rise a lot more slowly than the 3.8 percent annual rate of the summer quarter.
The only hint of good news was in the September report on personal income and consumption in Septemer, also from the Commerce Department yesterday, which was stronger than expected. Spending on goods and services jumped by nine-tenths of 1 percent.
In fact, the level of consumer spending in September is so far above the average for the third quarter that it implies an increase at a 2 percent annual rate in consumer spending in the fourth quarter, even if consumption remains flat through December. That level would be maintained unless consumption actually declined in the coming months, or the Government revised away the September increase, Mr. Steinberg said.
But income growth is not strong enough to support increases in spending at the September pace. After-tax income has been climbing more slowly than spending, and consumers have squeezed the saving rate down to 3.7 percent, close to a postwar low. "That can't go on forever," Mr. Steinberg said.
Future spending gains require more job growth, one reason that economists from Wall Street to Washington are waiting so anxiously for tomorrow's report on October employment.

HEADLINE: Investors Turn Sights On Short-Term Bonds

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Investors are pouring into short-term bond funds and other higher-yielding products, fund managers said this week, looking for higher yields than the 5 percent or less from bank certificates of deposits and money market funds.
"Folks have got the 5 percent blues and are looking for other places to put their money," said William Corneliuson, the vice chairman of the Strong Funds in Milwaukee. 
 The trend is most evident, he said, in short-term bond funds. The funds -- which focus on investing in securities that mature in less than three years -- tend to be less volatile than long-term bond funds, and yet offer better yields than comparable bank C.D.'s or money-market funds.
"It's a way to enhance the yield and do it with a controlled level of risk," Mr. Corneliuson said.
The trend is hard to detect in the latest industry figures, released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, because the trade association does not break out the short-term funds separately. But many mutual fund sponsors interviewed this week said they had noticed the trend.
The current period is a likely time for the shift to take place, many mutual fund executives said, because the six-month bank certificates of deposit that are bought around tax season and the 12-month certificates that many investors began buying after the October 1987 stock market crash need to be rolled over. "A lot of that money has been continually rolling over, but the rates that investors can earn are so low, they're saying 'I think I'll take a chance and move my money into bonds or the stock market,' " said Michael J. Hines, a vice president for marketing at Fidelity Investments in Boston
According to the institute, bond funds on the whole attracted $7.9 billion of net new capital in September, after adjusting for redemptions and transfers among funds. That was up 13.9 percent over August, when $7 billion flowed into bond funds, and the highest monthly figure since March 1987.
All 11 categories of bond and mutual funds tracked saw net cash flow rise during the month, although the September increases for corporate and municipal bond funds fell short of the August increases.
Equity funds attracted $3.1 billion of net new capital, up from $2.8 billion in August, continuing a rebound that has been apparent since the end of the Persian Gulf war. The one category of equity funds that showed a decline was option-income funds, which sell options against the stocks in their portfolios to generate additional income. That group experienced a net outflow of $19.5 million.
Although the October results will not be in for another month, Mr. Hines of Fidelity, predicted that it would be "the strongest month we've seen all year on a net sales basis."
In his view, investors will move increasingly to longer maturities in search of higher yields. And he said he detects a strong preference to be diversified. He pointed to Fidelity's asset manager fund, which has grown in popularity because it invests in stocks, bonds and money market securities.
"Investors are diversifying," he said. "Government economic policy has got them concerned, and it's making them more conservative. And when they do get conservative, mutual fund investors want to be more diversified than usual."

HEADLINE: Trade Official Assails Europe Over Ecology

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, today criticized the agriculture policy of the European Community as environmentally destructive.
In an apparent response to growing attacks on American trade policies as ecologically risky, she painted the Bush Administration as sensitive to the environment. 
 While in a meeting with reporters, she echoed American criticism of the community's farm supports as the cause of overproduction and an international trade war of export subsidies. Mrs. Hills cited environmental concerns as reasons for cutting European agricultural subsidies as part of ongoing talks on freeing world trade.
 
'They're Killing the Land'
 "They've broken the bank, and they've got this mountain of overproduction and they're killing the land with these supports that generate production," she said in answer to a question about European agriculture subsidies. "They're mowing down the hedgerows so there's no refuge for small animals, they're using so much fertilizer that they're poisoning the groundwater and they're having this enormous production that is decreasing the world market price."
The Washington office of the European Community declined to comment.
But Jaap Mol, the economics minister at Embassy of the Netherlands in Washington, pointed to the policy paper on trade and environment recently issued by that nation's Minister of Foriegn Trade and circulated to other countries in the European Community. "There is no policy from the United States Administration," he said.
The Administration and most foreign countries have opposed the explicit inclusion of environmental standards in trade agreements. But environmentalists have expressed growing fears that the most polluting industries will locate their factories in countries with lax regulations and export to regions with more pollution controls.
Last spring, a coalition of environmental groups and organized labor posed a serious threat to the Administration's eventually successful drive to keep sole authority to negotiate trade agreements, submitting them to Congress only for final approval.
A much more emotional issue this fall has been a decision by a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade disallowing an American ban on imports of Mexican tuna. The United States banned the tuna imports because Mexican fishing vessels kill more dolphins than American vessels.
One widely distributed poster in Washington shows a monster, labeled "GATT-zilla," clutching a forlorn dolphin in one paw, a can of DDT in the other and crushing the Capitol building under its feet. The GATT's executive council must confirm the panel's report before the United States can be ordered to repeal the ban, and the council postponed consideration of the report at a meeting earlier this month.
 
Reviewing the Issues
 Mrs. Hills said that at her initiative, a GATT working group will begin reviewing environmental issues.
"I do think that these issues are going to intersect more and more with trade during this decade, and that we're going to have to analyze them and come up with a multilateral way of dealing with them," Mrs. Hills said.
But she added that trade sanctions were not always the best way to tackle environmental issues. The Administration is conducting talks on environmental issues.

HEADLINE: Race for Senate Shows Big Split On Health Care

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Two days ago, Harris Wofford toured a Harrisburg hospital to dramatize his call for national health insurance, a stand that has contributed to the Democrat's stunning rise in polls taken for Pennsylvania's Senate race.
Today his Republican opponent, former Gov. Dick Thornburgh, toured a hospital, too, and also talked about the way he would resolve the nation's health care problems. Saying there are no easy answers, he argued for a redoubled effort to contain medical costs through competition and deregulation, and he referred derisively to national health insurance as "an untried, untested, radical and costly" alternative. 
 After Mr. Thornburgh's news conference inside Children's Hospital on Fifth Avenue, Mr. Wofford, the state's interim Senator, held his own across the street. "This morning at this scene Dick Thornburgh perpetrated the crime of fraud," said Mr. Wofford, referring to a prepared statement. "He appeared here in an attempt to portray himself as a supporter of health care, but the reality is that Dick Thornburgh is Public Enemy No. 1 when it comes to national health care."
 
A Surprise Move
 To the surprise of many political analysts, Mr. Thornburgh did not try to defuse the campaign issue by softening his opposition to national health insurance.
"Given the growing popularity of national health insurance," said Randall M. Miller, a political analyst, "I had expected Thornburgh would have made a death bed conversion to support national health insurance, at least in principle." Professor Miller is a historian and political campaign specialist at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia.
Mr. Miller and other analysts explain the rising interest in health-care insurance by pointing to Pennsylvanians' concern about the state's sluggish economy, job insecurity and fear of losing health benefits along with the job.
The national recession has hurt Pennsylvania, especially because the state lost about 400,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs in the last decade and added about 500,000 jobs in services industries, where pay and benefits are much lower. Unemployment is pushing 7 percent, and 401,000 workers were unemployed in September.
 
Sharpen Distinctions
 Today was the first time in the campaign that Mr. Thornburgh has spoken at length about health care insurance, but he said he was merely fleshing out a position paper that his campaign had released in September. He even suggested that he might not be discussing health care at all if it was not for his opponent. "Because the issue has risen to such prominence because of my opponent's call for a nationalized health care system, I want to sharpen some of the distinctions between" the two positions, he said.
Mr. Thornburgh also downplayed the importance of poll results released on Tuesday, saying that he had twice won the governor's seat by narrow margins, in 1978 and 1982, and that this race would be no different. Those polls indicated that the race was too close to call, with the candidates lost in the statistical shadow cast by the margins of sampling error in the polls.
The Thornburgh campaign dismissed the polls as inaccurate, but even as Mr. Thornburgh spoke this morning, another poll was being released that corroborated the findings of the two earlier polls.
Today's poll, conducted by Millersville University of Pennsylvania in Lancaster and WHTM-TV in Pittsburgh, found that 44 percent favored Mr. Thornburgh and 41 percent favored Mr. Wofford, and that the results fell within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The poll was based on telephone interviews with 549 registered voters across the state over the weekend. The poll also found that, by a 52-to-42 margin, more Pennsylvanians view Mr. Wofford as more qualified to work on health care problems than Mr. Thornburgh.
 
Hospital Tour
 Mr. Thornburgh briefly toured the Children's Hospital here today, making a cursory inspection of a high-tech heart monitor attached to a small boy. Mr. Thornburgh then walked, hand in hand, with his wife, Ginny, through a waiting room, where they stopped to chat with parents.
Mr. Thornburgh was also accompanied by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. At a news conference in the hospital, Dr. Sullivan endorsed Mr. Thornburgh's ideas on making health care more affordable and accessible. "I view it as a very forward looking, practical, workable health plan," he said.
But Mr. Thornburgh's plan, like Mr. Wofford's plan, is little more than a statement of philosophy and goals. A five-page document, entitled "Dick Thornburgh's Plan for Affordable Health Care," recommends many things, such as promoting competition, encouraging preventive medicine, reforming malpractice medical insurance and reducing unnecessary medical services. Mr. Thornburgh gave few details on how to accomplish this agenda, but estimated that it would save as much as $75 billion a year.
He also proposed goals for reforming the Government-subsidized health-care programs, Medicare and Medicaid. He would reduce premiums paid by the elderly with savings reaped by reducing fraud and abuses. He also said he would work to have Pennsylvania's Medicaid program expanded to cover more of the state's working poor. Asked how the financially strapped state would finance such an expansion of service, Mr. Thornburgh replied, "I don't know what the cost would be in Pennsylvania, and it certainly ought to be met out of the record tax increases that the Administration my opponent served in has imposed on Pennsylvanians."
 
'Innovation' Is Taking Place
 Mr. Wofford, who served as state Secretary of Industry and Labor, has said that Gov. Robert P. Casey had already appointed him interim Senator by the time Republicans and Democrats enacted the $3.3 billion tax increase. Mr. Wofford was appointed as interim Senator in May after Senator John Heinz, a Republican, was killed in an airplane crash over suburban Philadelphia.
Mr. Thornburgh described the "the big difference" between his ideas and Mr. Wofford's this way: "He calls for a massive, Federal bureaucracy to run a centrally directed health-care system out of Washington, D.C., and, in effect, micro-manage our entire health-care system. My call is for a partnership that brings together government at Federal level and government at state level, where a lot of the innovation is taking place, including employers, who have stake in the cost of health insurance, the insurers and health care professionals."
Paul Begala, Mr. Wofford's campaign manager, said that Mr. Thornburgh was using the same argument that "his ideological ancestors" had used to oppose other national benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security that benefit the middle class.
"Mr. Thornburgh doesn't understand the issue," said Mr. Begala. "Respected studies show that $67 billion to $242 billion a year could be saved with national health insurance. It will save money, that is why we need it."
Some political analysts said today that Mr. Thornburgh made a wise political decision to address the health care insurance issue, which has emerged as Mr. Wofford's central campaign theme. But they said his response today may be too little, too late and too confusing.
"To the man on the street who is concerned about being financially ruined by an illness in his family, Thornburgh's talk about cleaning up a little fraud, or lessening the bureaucracy sounds a lot like gobbledygook," said G. Terry Madonna, who conducted the Millersville/ WHTM-TV poll and is director of the university's Center for Politics and Public Affairs.
National health care insurance is taking center stage in this Pennsylvania election, the only Senate race in the nation this year, and some experts think the issue could spill over into next year's elections as a major bone of contention between the parties.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
Excerpts From Speeches in Madrid: 'Long and Painful History' of Struggle

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from speeches yesterday by President Bush, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, at the opening session of the Middle East peace conference in Madrid. Mr. Bush's speech was transcribed by Reuters. Mr. Gorbachev's remarks were transcribed by The Associated Press as he spoke through an interpreter. The A.P. provided excerpts from Mr. Moussa's speech, which was translated by Cable News Network.
 
PRESIDENT BUSH
 We come to Madrid on a mission of hope -- to begin work on a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement to the conflict in the Middle East. We come here to seek peace for a part of the world that in the long memory of man has known far too much hatred, anguish and war. I can think of no endeavor more worthy, or more necessary. 
 Our objective must be clear and straightforward. It is not simply to end the state of war in the Middle East and replace it with a state of non-belligerency. This is not enough; this would not last. Rather, we seek peace, real peace. And by real peace I mean treaties. Security. Diplomatic relations. Economic relations. Trade. Investment. Cultural exchange. Even tourism.
 What we seek is a Middle East where vast resources are no longer devoted to armaments. A Middle East where young people no longer have to dedicate and, all too often, give their lives to combat. A Middle East no longer victimized by fear and terror. A Middle East where normal men and women lead normal lives.
 Let no one mistake the magnitude of this challenge. The struggle we seek to end has a long and painful history. Every life lost -- every outrage, every act of violence -- is etched deep in the hearts and history of the people of this region. Theirs is a history that weighs heavily against hope. And yet, history need not be man's master.
 I expect that some will say that what I am suggesting is impossible. But think back. Who back in 1945 would have thought that France and Germany, bitter rivals for nearly a century, would become allies in the aftermath of World War II? And who two years ago would have predicted that the Berlin wall would come down? And who in the early 1960's would have believed that the cold war would come to a peaceful end, replaced by cooperation -- exemplified by the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union are here today -- not as rivals, but as partners, as Prime Minister Gonzalez pointed out.
 No, peace in the Middle East need not be a dream. Peace is possible. The Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty is striking proof that former adversaries can make and sustain peace. And moreover, parties in the Middle East have respected agreements, not only in the Sinai, but on the Golan Heights as well.
 The fact that we are all gathered here today for the first time attests to a new potential for peace. Each of us has taken an important step toward real peace by meeting here in Madrid. All the formulas on paper, all the pious declarations in the world won't bring peace if there is no practical mechanism for moving ahead. . . .
Peace will only come as the result of direct negotiations, compromise, give-and-take. Peace cannot be imposed from the outside by the United States or anyone else. While we will continue to do everything possible to help the parties overcome obstacles, peace must come from within.
 
 
Living With Consequences
 We come here to Madrid as realists. We do not expect peace to be negotiated in a day, or a week, or a month, or even a year. It will take time. Indeed, it should take time -- time for parties so long at war to learn to talk to one another, to listen to one another. Time to heal old wounds and build trust. In this quest, time need not be the enemy of progress.
 What we envision is a process of direct negotiations proceeding along two tracks, one between Israel and the Arab states, the other between Israel and the Palestinians. Negotiations are to be conducted on the basis of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.
 The real work will not happen here in the plenary session, but in direct bilateral negotiations. This conference cannot impose a settlement on the participants or veto agreements. And just as important, the conference can only be reconvened with the consent of every participant. Progress is in the hands of the parties who must live with the consequences.
 Soon after the bilateral talks commence, parties will convene as well to organize multilateral negotiations. These will focus on issues that cross national boundaries and are common to the region: arms control, water, refugee concerns, economic development. Progress in these fora is not intended as a substitute for what must be decided in the bilateral talks. To the contrary, progress in the multilateral issues can help create an atmosphere in which longstanding bilateral disputes can more easily be settled. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	For Israel and the Palestinians, a framework already exists for diplomacy. Negotiations will be conducted in phases, beginning with talks on interim self-government arrangements. We aim to reach agreement within one year. And once agreed, interim self-government arrangements will last for five years. beginning the third year, negotiations will commence on permanent status.
 No one can say with any precision what the end result will be. In our view, something must be developed, something acceptable to Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan, that gives the Palestinian people meaningful control over their own lives and fate and provides for the acceptance and security of Israel.
 We can all appreciate that both Israelis and Palestinians are worried about compromise, worried about compromising even the smallest point for fear it becomes a precedent for what really matters. But no one should avoid compromise on interim arrangements for a simple reason: nothing agreed to now will prejudice permanent-status negotiations. . . .
Real peace -- lasting peace -- must be based upon security for all states and peoples, including Israel. For too long the Israeli people have lived in fear, surrounded by an unaccepting Arab world. Now is the ideal moment for the Arab world to demonstrate that attitudes have changed, that the Arab world is willing to live in peace with Israel and make allowances for Israel's reasonable security needs.
 We know that peace must also be based on fairness. In the absence of fairness, there will be no legitimacy, no stability. This applies above all to the Palestinian people, many of whom have known turmoil and frustration above all else. Israel now has an opportunity to demonstrate that it is willing to enter into a new relationship with its Palestinian neighbors: one predicated upon mutual respect and cooperation.
 
 
What Peace Will Bring
 Throughout the Middle East, we seek a stable and enduring settlement. We've not defined what this means. Indeed, I make these points with no map showing where the final borders are to be drawn. Nevertheless, we believe territorial compromise is essential for peace. Boundaries should reflect the quality of both security and political arrangements. The United States is prepared to accept whatever the parties themselves find acceptable. What we seek, as I said on March 6, is a solution that meets the twin tests of fairness and security.
 I know -- I expect we all know -- that these negotiations will not be easy. I know, too, that these negotiations will not be smooth. There will be disagreement and criticism, setbacks -- who knows -- possibly interruption. Negotiation and compromise are always painful. Success will escape us if we focus solely upon what is being given up.
 We must fix our vision on what real peace would bring. Peace, after all, means not just avoiding war and the costs of preparing for it. The Middle East is blessed with great resources: physical, financial and, yes, above all, human. New opportunities are within reach, if we only have the vision to embrace them. . . .
The alternative to peace in the Middle East is a future of violence and waste and tragedy. In any future war lurks the danger of weapons of mass destruction. As we learned in the gulf war, modern arsenals make it possible to attack urban areas, to put the lives of innocent men, women and children at risk, to transform city streets, schools and children's playgrounds into battlefields.
 Today, we can decide to take a different path to the future -- to avoid conflict. I call upon all parties to avoid unilateral acts, be they words or deeds, that would invite retaliation or, worse yet, prejudice or even threaten this process itself. I call upon all parties to consider taking measures that will bolster mutual confidence and trust, steps that signal a sincere commitment to reconciliation. . . .
 And we will call upon our friends and allies in Europe and in Asia to join with us in providing resources so that peace and prosperity go hand in hand.
Outsiders can assist, but in the end, it is up to the peoples and governments of the Middle East to shape the future of the Middle East. It is their opportunity and it is their responsibility to do all that they can to take advantage of this gathering, this historic gathering, and what it symbolizes and what it promises.
 No one should assume that the oppportunity before us to make peace will remain if we fail to seize the moment. Ironically, this is an opportunity born of war -- the destruction of past wars, the fear of future wars. The time has come to put an end to war. The time has come to choose peace. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	We have seen too many generations of children whose haunted eyes show only fear -- too many funerals for their brothers and sisters, the mothers and fathers who died too soon -- too much hatred, too little love. And if we cannot summon the courage to lay down the past for ourselves, let us resolve to do it for the children.
 May God bless and guide the work of this conference, and may this conference set us on the path of peace. Thank you.
 
PRESIDENT GORBACHEV
 I welcome here the presence of the President of the United States of America, the Arab delegations and observers, the Israeli delegation, representatives of the European Community, and of the United Nations Secretary General. The composition of the participants, as well as the nature and objectives of this conference, are eloquent testimony to the fact that we're participants in an event of major importance in new world politics.
The road to this point was strewn with thousands of victims and with devastations and calamities suffered by whole peoples. It was marred by hatred and atrocities, and many were the crossroads on the path that were fraught with danger of global conflagration. This conflict, the longest in the latter half of the 20th century, bears the heavy stamp of the so-called cold war, and it was not until an end was put to that that ending this conflict became a tangible possibility too.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It was the will of history that, without an improvement and then a radical change in Soviet-U.S. relations, we would never have witnessed the profound qualitative changes in the world that now make it possible to speak in terms of an entirely new age, an age of peace in world history. Movement in that direction has begun, and it is only in this context that we can understand the fact that a tangible hope has emerged for an Arab-Israeli settlement.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Today, we have a unique opportunity, and it would be unforgivable to miss this opportunity. Success is in everybody's interests, not only because the rights of the peoples and nations and of the individual are increasingly recognized today as the universal foundation for our world order, but also for another reason of particular urgency and gravity, and that is the fact that the Middle East has become one of the most heavily armed regions in the world, where lethal weapons and nuclear technologies are building up and where other weapons of mass destruction are also to be found.
 
Vast Mideast Potential
 There is justified cause for alarm. The international community is entitled to expect that this conference will come up with decisions that will put this concern to rest. In my view, the conference can only succeed if no one seeks any victory for one side over the other, but all seek a shared victory over a cruel past. I'm speaking of peace, rather than merely a cessation of the state of war, and a durable peace implies the implementation of and respect for the rights of the Palestinian people.
We have restored diplomatic relations with Israel. Now that deep-rooted democratic changes are taking place in our country and in the world and now that a real process toward settling the Middle East crisis is getting under way, the absence of relations with Israel was becoming senseless. We hope and will try to make sure that this will be of benefit to the peoples of our two countries and the entire Arab world. Peace in the Middle and Near East would benefit all. . . . The region has vast potential. Turning to constructive pursuits, it will help not only to resolve the problems of the nations that live there, but would also become an important pillar of support for global international progress and prosperity. We must break the fetters of the past and do away with hostility, militarism, terrorism, hostage-taking, and those actions that turn people into refugees.
Our country, as a participant in the Middle East process and a neighbor that has maintained longstanding and extensive ties with the nations of the region, has a special stake in the success of this conference. . . . The pace we set and the way we tackle the problems that have emerged at the present stage of world development will have a strong bearing on the settlement of conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The acceleration of historical evolution when based on democracy is truly amazing. The tremendous social energy of the masses of people is being released, and typical of the way this is made manifest is the dramatic growth of national self-awareness and national consolidation, particularly where national feelings were long ignored or suppressed.
This is, in general, a positive process that holds out great promise for the future. It will add greatly to the creative potential of the world community in all its diversity. We now have a far better chance of keeping this process on a civilized course. At the micro-level of world politics, there is a recognition of the complex implications of national aspirations and a willingness to put out the fires of inter-ethnic and international conflicts as witnessed in the Middle East, in Southern Africa, in Cambodia, in Korea, Afghanistan, and Central America.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Of late, the world has been confronted by yet another crisis of tremendous proportions. What I have in mind is my own country. It became inevitable as a result of latent contradictions building up over a long period of time. A great country is going through a great transformation.
It's a painful and arduous process which has brought about personal tragedies and inter-ethnic and regional conflicts. Much in the world depends on how our crisis will be resolved.
Once this crisis is overcome, our union will acquire new qualities and potential as a world power based materially on a market economy as part of the world economy, politically on democracy as part of universal democracy, and intellectually on the new thinking.

 	 	 		. . .	 	This job is for us to do. Our peoples will have to go through a difficult period of transition, but it's important that, under the new conditions created because it was our country that launched the initiative to end confrontation and to join up with the rest of the world, that the world too has not remained indifferent to our great cause . . . restore if room. The world community is becoming increasingly aware that what is happening in the Soviet Union has a larger bearing than any regional conflict on the vital interests of the greater parts of today's world.
 
Peacetime Challenges
 Today we hear not only murmurs of approval and good wishes, we are also beginning to see practical support as well. And this is a very significant sign of the movement toward a new era, a new age. And President Bush's initiative regarding nuclear arms, with our reciprocal initiatives, constitutes a major step and a prescient symbol of this movement.
For almost half a century, nuclear arms used to be the axis upon which world politics turned. The task is now by changing the nature of those politics to replace it with something completely new and more attuned with the wheels of 21st-century history. Mankind faces many peacetime challenges All of them are formidable ones. And they include all what we call global problems: the environment, energy, food supplies, population, all the problems of development, and the total abolition of the nuclear threat, which is spreading to the edges from the former center of world confrontation.
All these challenges can only be met through joint efforts. Therefore it is essential to fracture the logic of so many millennia, and particularly the logic of this century, persistently and patiently, to shape a new logic of interdependence, interaction and cooperation.
But this task is an extremely difficult one. We see both in our country and elsewhere, even here at this conference, ghosts of the old thinking, sometimes unnoticed, are still present among us. When we rid ourselves of their presence we will be better able to move toward a new world order. . . . And in respect of our individual vision of this new order, it appears that we should now promote this objective process itself, relying on the relevant mechanisms of the United Nations, the C.S.C.E., the European Community's modernized, old, and completely new structures of regional security and cooperation, as well as the institutions created for crisis prevention and conflict settlements.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is for the delegations directly participating in the conference to sort out the details of this enormous task. As co-chairman of the conference, we will be in regular contact with our American counterparts, and we will do our utmost to find solutions for which your peoples in the entire world have long been yearning.
In my address I've mentioned the more general problems of the global process. I did this in order to emphasize once again the important international context of this conference and of the challenge which you are facing. I wish you every success.
 
MR. MOUSSA
 . . . Arab rights to Arab territories cannot be compromised. Recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people is the prime assurance for peaceful coexistence between Israelis, Palestinians and, indeed, the Arabs in their respective homelands.
Arabs did not come to relinquish their rights . . . They came to search in good faith, with mutual trust, a common ground. . . . Firstly, the legal status of the Palestinian people should not be challenged. They are not mere inhabitants, residents of conquered territories. They are people with a history, a culture, a distinct national identity on an equal footing with other peoples in the world.
Secondly, the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights are occupied Arab territories . . . They have their legitimate owners, and claims not based on principles of legitimacy and international law have no place in the world of today.
Thirdly, settlements established in territories occupied since '67, including Jerusalem, are illegal, and more settlements will foreclose potential progress toward real peace and cast doubt on the credibility of the process itself. Settlements have to be halted for they obstruct peace, undermine the groundwork for negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories, and erode the will to coexist.
Fourthly, the holy city of Jerusalem has its special status. It should remain free, accessible and sacred for followers of Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The occupying power should not exercise monopoly or illegal sovereignty over this holy city. It should not persist in unilateral decisions declared to annex the holy city as this lacks validity or legitimacy. The status of the holy city should be subject to negotiation and settled by agreeing to the context of legitimacy established by internationally accepted resolutions . . .
This is a moment of truth, commitment and hope. We've opted for peace, true peace. The path of peace is thorny. The march is most tiring and arduous, and the challenge is colossal and immense, but the objective is lofty, noble and worthy of our pilgrimage to peace.

HEADLINE: JOBS ARE AT RISK IN HAITI SANCTIONS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Amid the drone of assembly lines on vast shop floors and the purring, air-conditioned cool in back-room offices, the impending effects of a stringent United States economic embargo imposed on Haiti on Tuesday seemed present on every face in this city's sprawling industrial zone.
More than 20 years ago, Haiti began developing light-assembly industries in the region, in which textiles and simple electronic components are sent from the United States for assembly and then shipped back. 
 Now, many of the owners and the employees of the 160 or so companies in this field fear that the sanctions will strangle Haiti's fragile export industries. The sanctions were imposed in an effort to help restore constitutional order after the military overthrow of the country's first democratically elected President.
In the month since the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was forced into exile in Venezuela, Haitian industrialists say that more than 1,200 of the assembly industry's 32,000 or so jobs have been lost as companies like GTE and piece-work concerns have left in the face of the political turmoil and economic uncertainty brought on by the coup.
 
Workers Back Sanctions
 Investors and economists say that at least 200,000 people live directly from the income of workers in the assembly industry, and that countless more jobs in the hemisphere's poorest country depend upon them indirectly. With exports of about $300 million, the assembly industries provide as much as 40 percent of Haiti's foreign exchange earnings.
But even if the sanctions cost them their jobs, many workers, whose wages typically average about $5 a day, say they continue to support moves for the return of Father Aristide, including the sanctions.
"We have been living under an embargo all our lives," said one woman who sold food outside a factory, echoing popular attitudes toward the embargo. "We are willing to suffer more to bring back Aristide."
Business executives fear the worse.
"This could be the death of the economy of Haiti," said Jean Baker, a children's clothing manufacturer who employs 1,000 people. "We are facing an economic catastrophe with major social and economic repercussions and time is against us."
 
Embargo Effective Nov. 5
 Asked how soon the embargo would force him to begin laying off workers, Mr. Baker said, "We have to start as of today."
The sanctions bar American imports and exports of all goods from Haiti, with the exception of selected foods and medicines, which were exempted for humanitarian reasons. Although the sanctions take effect Nov. 5, the executive order that decreed them gives Haitian exporters like Mr. Baker 30 days to ship goods that are already in production.
Mr. Baker urged rapid negotiations with the Organization of American States mission that is arriving in Haiti next week to seek Father Aristide's return, vowing to "get on a plane and meet the O.A.S. in Jamaica, Washington, or wherever, as soon as possible." But other prominent business leaders bitterly accused the United States of unfairly punishing them.
"This is a cyclone that is going to strike Haiti," said Albert Herry, a French factory manager who has worked in Haiti for 21 years. "Bush has closed his ears."
 
Striking Back at U.S.
 Others said their country must answer with countermeasures of its own, like rescinding agreements that allow the United States Coast Guard to repatriate thousands of Haitians seeking to reach the shores of Florida by boat.
"Before there is no food and everyone goes crazy here, the United States is going to see an immigration wave that makes the Vietnamese boat people look like nothing," said one businessman, who deplored the coup but was angry about the sanctions.
While people awaited the effects of the new trade sanctions, a suspension of shipments of petroleum products this month by Venezuela, Haiti's principal supplier, has already caused many disruptions.
Snarled lines of motorists waiting to buy gasoline, sometimes as long as a half-mile, have become common throughout the city. Petroleum industry experts say that unless current supplies are renewed, gasoline supplies may run out in a few days. Fuel oil, needed to generate electricity, is expected to last through November.

HEADLINE: Cuomo to Call Back Legislature to Cope With Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo pegged the shortfall in the state's budget at $689 million today and said he would summon the Legislature back in special session to deal with the problem.
At the same time, New York City officials said they faced at least a $200 million gap in their own budget, even without the threat of further state cuts. [Page B7.] 
 The dire fiscal news, which in both cases was attributed to lower tax revenues and increased social-service spending brought on by the recession, was the strongest indication yet that the sharp cuts each government made earlier this year have failed to restore the spending balance pledged by Governor Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Republicans seized on the budget gap to attack Mr. Cuomo, who is still mulling whether to run for President. His chief Republican adversary, Ralph J. Marino, the State Senate majority leader, made a pointed observation that it would be hard to make a "meaningful run" for the White House with the budget problems still unresolved.
The Governor said he had not ruled out any option to close the budget gap, including new taxes or further cuts in state assistance that had been pledged this year to New York City and other struggling localities. Last December, the Legislature took away nearly $200 million they had earlier voted to give to local school districts.
Releasing the $689 million deficit projection for the state's $29 billion budget, the Governor'a Budget Director, Patrick J. Bulgaro, said he had found that "the weakness in the national economy has continued to erode state revenue collections and is now driving up demand for certain collections."
Mr. Bulgaro attributed roughly half of the shortfall to lower than projected revenues from personal income taxes, and the other half to higher spending on Medicaid, welfare and tuition-assistance programs brought on by bulging caseloads.
The Governor has consistently portrayed the problems as similar to those in other states and rooted in failed Federal policies, so presumably he could cite a strong rationale for running for President despite his problems at home. Some of his advisers have felt compelled to point out in recent days that Franklin D. Roosevelt won the Presidency even though his state was overwhelmed by the Depression.
 
Time to Decide
 Governor Cuomo said he would take up to a week to decide how he would recommend closing the state budget gap, the state's second consecutive huge midyear deficit, and he said that he did not know when he would ask lawmakers to return to Albany but that it would be "as soon as possible."
Both Mr. Marino and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Democrat, said they would be extremely reluctant to pursue either local aid cuts or new taxes. Mr. Cuomo said he had ordered state agencies to prepare for cuts of up to 4 percent in their budgets, but this would produce only about a third of the savings needed to close the $689 million gap.
The Republican-controlled State Senate has vowed to concentrate virtually all of the cuts in Medicaid and welfare spending, a course that both the Governor and the Assembly Speaker, Mr. Miller, have attacked as singling out the state's poorest and most infirm residents as a target.
 
A 'Stretchout' Solution
 Mr. Miller, meanwhile, suggested today that a "stretchout" solution could be found, in which part of the deficit could essentially be rolled over into next year, but that approach might be dismissed by other officials as fiscally irresponsible. Thus, even as the magnitude of the problem was brought into sharp focus, the means to solve it remained very much unclear.
The timing of the special session is unclear. "At this moment you have to assume," the Governor said, "that the Legislature has to come back. I'll try to suit their convenience to the extent that I can, but it has to be done as soon as possible."
The outcome could be complicated not only by Mr. Cuomo's ruminations about or actual pursuit of the Presidency but also by the trial of the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, on Federal fraud charges, scheduled to begin on Nov. 12.
Mr. Miller denied that there would be any such problems, saying in a telephone interview today, "Don't worry about it -- it's not your problem." He said that if there was a special session and if he was in a courtroom, he would designate one of his Democratic colleagues to lead the Assembly in his place.
 
Heaviest Pressure
 The heaviest pressure still falls on Mr. Cuomo, who is expected to at least start the search for a solution by recommending, within the next week, his plan for closing the gap.
He did not elaborate on any plans today, responding to a question about possible cuts in local aid or social services: "I would never say it's impossible. I wouldn't say anything. I don't know what we're going to do."
Whatever the Governor proposes, he is likely to strain relations with his Democratic allies and to come under relentless attack from Republicans, especially if he continues to be seen as a potential Presidential candidate.
"It's no wonder Governor Cuomo is predicting another budget gap," said C. D. Rappleyea Jr., the Republican leader in the Assembly. "He had no plans, and no plans to make plans, to deal with the deficit as it happened."
But many of Mr. Cuomo's fellow Democrats dismissed the Republican complaints as predictable partisan sniping. Several said they did not believe that the attention he will have to focus on filling the hole in his budget should prove fatal to a Presidential bid.
"So what? He can make a TV commercial in Albany," said Speaker Miller.

HEADLINE: In Louisiana, Duke Divides Old Loyalties

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Oct. 30

 BODY:
When David Duke entered a hotel ballroom here today, Jo Ann Jernigan, a retired nurse and lifelong Democrat, jumped to her feet and applauded.
"I've got to see my candidate," she said Mr. Duke, the Republican candidate for governor and former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. "He's so cute. How can someone who looks like that be bad?" 
 Mrs. Jernigan's friend, Sara M. Spencer, a retired teacher and lifelong Republican, remained seated and covered her eyes with her hand.
"I can't even bear to look at him," she said. "He's a phony. He would destroy this state. He wants to set the blacks back 100 years."
The tight and tough 1991 Louisiana governor's race, said one man here, "has flip-flopped the state, turning Democrats into Republicans and vice versa." It has also divided many longtime friends like the two white women from Monroe attending the state convention of the American Association of Retired Persons here.
And today in a packed ballroom at the Baton Rouge Hilton, those divisions were clearly on display. Mr. Duke, a State Representative from Metairie, and his Democratic opponent in the Nov. 16 runoff election, Edwin W. Edwards, a three-term governor, sat three feet apart at a forum and exchanged insults as well as ideas while 500 retired people frequently booed and hissed the two men's responses.
"In Louisiana, politics can get very, very personal," said a Duke worker, James A. McPherson. "This is their third meeting. It gets hot every time."
Ignoring the pleas of the moderator not to discuss the personal backgrounds of their opponent, both men did exactly that.
Mr. Edwards, a flamboyant, wealthy politician seeking a comeback after surviving two trials on corruption charges, avoided mentioning Mr. Duke's past ties with the Klan and neo-Nazi groups. He did say that Mr. Duke had failed to pay state income taxes for three years "until they caught you."
Mr. Duke said he did not have to file because he did not make enough money. But before he could finish, he was pelted with boos by the largely white crowd that generally seemed supportive of Mr. Duke.
"Isn't it refreshing," he said, trying to recapture the audience, "that you have a politician who doesn't have money everywhere. I'm not like Mr. Edwards. I only have one house."
Mr. Edwards shot back that it appeared "you never had a job."
After the forum, Gloria Richardson, a retired secretary, sighed deeply.
"I'm one of those people, and there are a lot of us, who don't like either one of them," she said. "I still don't like them. I have a big problem."
Mr. Duke seemed to win the most applause today. His anti-welfare pitch has struck a responsive cord in this economically troubled state.
During the 60-minute forum he answered questions about health care, crime, agencies for the elderly and tax reform with attacks on welfare and what he described as an increase in the number of "illegitimate children."
"The welfare system expands everyday," he said. "Why should your tax dollars go to people to buy lottery tickets?"
Even Mr. Edwards admitted that the audience appeared to side with Mr. Duke . He said he expected to have a rough reception because "these are retirees who are having a hard time."
"They and others have been beguiled by his simplistic approach to government," Mr. Edwards said. "Duke is holding out false hope and a cruel hoax."
 
Edwards Courts His Foes
 For the most part, this has been a relatively uneventful week of campaigning, but the action has been fast and furious behind the scenes.
Mr. Edwards has spent considerable time and effort courting the support of his once bitter political foe, Gov. Buddy Roemer. Mr. Roemer placed third, behind Mr. Edwards and Mr. Duke, in the state's open primary on Oct. 19.
Mr. Edwards met with Mr. Roemer at the Governor's mansion for an hour on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Governor, Rusty Jabour, said Mr. Roemer pressed for assurances that his efforts, especially in education, the environment and governmental ethics, would be continued in an Edwards Administration.
Mr. Roemer, a Democrat-turned-Republican, has disavowed Mr. Duke, as has the White House and the Republican National Committee. The Governor has not returned telephone calls from Mr. Duke and refuses to meet with him.
 
Anti-Government Approach
 But Governor Roemer has yet to say publicly whether he will vote for Mr. Edwards in the runoff.
Today, Mr. Duke said an endorsement of Mr. Edwards by Governor Roemer would "drive more people to my side" because "people see me as one person standing up against" special interests and big government.
But Mr. Edwards did receive the endorsement Tuesday of a former Louisiana Governor and political enemy, Dave Treen, a Republican. The Times-Picayune, in New Orleans, quoted Mr. Treen as saying, "David Duke must be defeated."
 
'We'd Be X-Rated'
 "His true agenda is repugnant in the extreme," the newspaper quoted Mr. Treen as saying.
Mr. Edwards also received the endorsements of two former candidates who finished well behind in the primary.
The state's business leaders have come out firmly against Mr. Duke, citing fears that a Duke victory would destroy Louisiana's tourism industry, smother economic development, spark boycotts and bloody the state's image around the world.
On Thursday, the Louisiana Council for Fiscal Reform, a business group, endorsed Mr. Edwards. The chairman, James R. Moffett said, "If Duke is elected, we can kiss economic development good-bye for at least four years. Louisiana wouldn't just be red-lined by business around the nation and around the world, we'd be X-rated."
The Times-Picayune has published several editorials titled "The Choice of Our Lives," questioning Mr. Duke's past and worrying about the state's future under a Duke Administration.
While Mr. Duke quit the Klan in 1980 and now dismisses his membership as youthful enthusiasm, he reportedly celebrated Hitler's birthday into the 1980's and remains active in the National Association for the Advancement of White People, an organization he created.
 
Almost Neck-and-Neck
 The election appears to be extremely close, according to the first statewide poll to be conducted since the primary.
The poll, commissioned by The Shreveport Times and published on Tuesday, said that of the 817 voters surveyed on Thursday through Saturday, 46 percent said they would vote for Mr. Edwards, 42 percent for Mr. Duke and 12 percent were undecided. The poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research of Columbia, Md., has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three and a half percentage points.
For now, two longtime friends like Mrs. Spencer and Mrs. Jernigan can still laugh about their political differences in the bitter campaign.
"She drove here with me," Mrs. Spencer said, patting her friend's hand. "I told her she'll have to run along side the car when we go home. No Duke supporter is riding with me."
Mr. Jernigan laughed. She said she waited in line for two hours to get into the ballroom to hear the two candidates.
"I've stood in longer lines at Disney World," she said. "But I don't think Duke's past is that atrocious. People change. I don't have the same ideas I did 20 years ago either."
"Hush up, it does matter," Mrs. Spencer said. "I think our reputation is on the line. I don't want either one of them but I have to make a choice for my state. I lived through World War II and I won't vote for a Nazi."

HEADLINE: Gorbachev and Mitterrand Meet, for a Little Embarrassment

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUSTONS, France, Oct. 30

 BODY:
After attending the opening of the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met President Francois Mitterrand in southern France tonight to smooth over relations ruffled by the French leader's response to the failed Soviet coup in August.
After Mr. Gorbachev was detained at his summer dacha in the Crimea, Mr. Mitterrand was strongly criticized at home for referring to "the new Soviet leaders" and suggesting that it would be possible to do business with them if they continued to carry out economic and political change. 
 In his just-published account of his imprisonment, "The August Coup," Mr. Gorbachev also wrote of the moments after his release: "Francois Mitterrand was due to call me. He didn't do it, and I regret it to this day. As soon as I got back to Moscow, I asked to be put into contact with him."
Tonight, in a televised interview broadcast from Mr. Mitterrand's country home at Latche, the two men, sitting side by side and occasionally looking embarrassed, went out of their way to explain that any misunderstandings had been dealt with.
Mr. Mitterrand insisted that no foreign leader spoke with Mr. Gorbachev by telephone until he was freed on the evening of Aug. 21. He added that it was "bad luck" that unlike President Bush, he could not reach the Soviet leader "during the half hour" between his release and his departure for Moscow.
Mr. Gorbachev then puzzlingly questioned the authenticity of the lines referring to Mr. Mitterrand that the interviewer read from his book. "I don't think that what you said was in my book," he said. "There is no criticism of the President of France. If anything like this is in my book, it's not my book."
Clearly flustered, Mr. Mitterrand then chipped in to suggest that the American and French texts were different. "In the English text, which was the initial text, there is no such quote," Mr. Mitterrand said. But the text published in the United States does include the reference to the telephone call that never came.
 
'Problem Resolved'
 Finally, the Soviet President recalled that the first foreign representative he met after his release was from the French Embassy in Moscow. "For me, that was an important sign of the position of France," he said, adding curtly, "Problem resolved."
Political experts said the fact that Mr. Mitterrand invited Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, to spend the night in his 18th-century farmhouse, just three miles from this summer vacation resort, was seen as an effort to underline their intimacy.
In talks tonight and on Thursday morning, the two men are also to discuss the Middle East and the Soviet Union's pressing economic needs.
The French leader said he had also won support for his idea of a meeting of the four nations with nuclear weapons in Europe -- the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain -- to discuss control of Soviet strategic weapons.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Add $1 Billion To Programs Aiding Children

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
In an unexpected move Tuesday night, the House of Representatives voted to add more than a $1 billion to children's programs by declaring child poverty a national emergency.
Legislatively, the bill's prospects seem dim. But politically, the bill adds a new wrinkle to the partisan maneuvering over domestic issues as next year's Presidential election approaches. 
 For its Democratic authors, among the bill's pleasing outcomes would be a Presidential veto embarrassing to the White House, which has supported emergency money for foreign aid but has resisted, in the name of fiscal responsibility, declaring emergencies at home.
 
'Our Own Children'
 "It's inappropriate to declare Turks and Kurds an emergency, and not our own children," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat who served as the provision's chief supporter.
Democratic Presidential candidates have made the same arguments about Mr. Bush's veto of a bill that would have provided $6 billion in extended unemployment benefits to American workers.
But Republicans are not the only ones put in a difficult political posture by Tuesday's House vote. Senior Congressional Democrats, including Representative Jamie L. Whitten of Mississippi, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, also opposed Ms. Schroeder's proposal. For Mr. Whitten, it complicates an already-troubled effort to dispense money to victims of hurricanes, fires, and other natural disasters.
The problem is last year's budget agreement, which dictates that any increases in domestic spending must be offset by corresponding cuts in other domestic programs. The only exception is for situations Congress and the President jointly designate as emergencies.
So far, President Bush has agreed to declare a budgetary emergency for only two bills, both of which provided foreign aid. Of the $1.1 billion supplied by the two bills, about $650 million went to Israel, $200 million went to Turkey and $140 million went to Kurdish refugees.
For several months, Mr. Whitten has been unsuccessfully trying to persuade the White House to use the emergency provisions to finance about $2.5 billion for farmers and other victims of natural disasters. The White House has told Congress to take the money from other domestic accounts.
So Mr. Whitten's bill already seemed headed for a veto when Ms. Schroeder slipped in an amendment on the floor that added the money for children's programs. Her provision, which passed by a vote of 243 to 180, adds $1.2 billion for Head Start programs, $100 million for child nutrition under the Women, Infants, and Children program, and $90 million for immunizations.
The legislation now travels to the Senate.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
How Sweet A Victory?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Many months after the event, George Bush and the United States today plucked the fruits of victory in the Persian Gulf war, but it is still much too early to predict how sweet they will prove to be.
Critics have suggested that the United States achieved far too little in the war, because Saddam Hussein was not overthrown, Iran remained as hostile and Kuwait as undemocratic as ever, and Saudi Arabia shed neither its isolation nor its archaic ways. Iraq was thrown out of Kuwait, some said, but very little else changed. 
 This morning it was clear that a very great deal had changed, even if most things remained shrouded in ambiguity and doubt as deep as the smog that blanketed Madrid. It was not only the energy and the diplomatic skills of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that created the remarkable tableau, with mortal enemies arranged around the same table, that Mr. Bush saw before him in the splendid Royal Palace this morning; all of his labors would have counted for very little without seismic shifts in the global order of things.
 
The Domestic Issue
 So far, so good. But taking the next enormous steps toward lasting peace in the Middle East may require the deep personal involvement of Mr. Bush over many months, and that may lie beyond his domestic political reach.
Dramatic and momentous as the peace conference seems to Arabs and Israelis, as well as American Jews and Arab-Americans and foreign policy specialists all over the world, it seems distant to average Americans, an event unlikely to influence their own well-being directly. So Mr. Bush's undoubted triumph in bringing the talks into being may not earn him commensurate gains at home.
The situation is profoundly different from that which used to confront American policy makers and American voters as they looked toward the Middle East. No longer is there a threat that an Arab-Israeli conflict could escalate into a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Though American politicians are not so impolitic as to say so, Israel is therefore much less of a strategic asset to the West than it used to be.
No longer is there an imminent threat of an oil embargo, with dire consequences for the world economy. Only the plight of the remaining American hostages touches most Americans deeply, and their number is slowly shrinking.
To many policy makers, the catastrophic situation in the Soviet Union, of which President Mikhail S. Gorbachev spoke so candidly today, and the emerging shape of Eastern and Western Europe, seem deserving of higher priority. To many voters -- most of them, according to recent opinion polls -- Mr. Bush seems far too inattentive to domestic economic problems.
As if to emphasize his intention to mind the store, he climbed back aboard Air Force One for the trip home without even waiting for the end of the first day's speeches here.
Facing a re-election campaign that will in a sense begin at a big Bush-Quayle fund-raiser in Texas later this week, faced with the growing conviction in the electorate that he spends too much time on foreign policy already, faced with growing evidence that further economic woes may lie ahead rather than the robust recovery he had hoped for, the President is seriously considering the curtailment of his trip to Asia and the Pacific next month.
From that perspective, it seems doubtful that Mr. Bush will want to put the Middle East at the top of his agenda, at least until next November has passed, in the way that Jimmy Carter focused intently on the peace process between Israel and Egypt in 1977 and 1978. And without sustained Presidential intervention, a decisive breakthrough in these talks may prove elusive.
 
Cold War Symbols
 The end of the cold war was symbolized by the presence here of Mr. Gorbachev as a co-sponsor. The conflict between the Arabs and the Israelis, the Soviet leader acknowledged, "bears the heavy stamp of the so-called cold war, and it was not until an end was put to that, that ending this conflict became a tangible possibility."
But the United States won the cold war as well as the gulf war, so it was President Bush, and not Mr. Gorbachev, who spoke first today and who set out the general terms within which the peace talks will proceed.
The Soviet Union is no longer the protector of Syria, any more than it was the protector of Iraq. The United States is the only credible outside power in the region. The gulf war also changed the internal military balance, not only by removing Iraq from the equation, at least for the moment, but also by demonstrating that high-tech American weapons, more available to Israel than to the Arabs, again at least for the moment, were the future of warfare.
So Syria is here, and the Palestinians and the Jordanians -- and because they are here, the Israelis did not feel that they could stay away without suffering further erosion in their relations with Washington.
 
Saudi as an Observer
 The Bush Administration was even able, in the end, to deliver Saudi Arabia to Madrid, with Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, flamboyantly garbed in the white robe of the desert, slipping into an observer's chair at the last moment. There could have been few more arresting demonstrations of his country's rapidly evolving regional role.
Mr. Bush sought to strike a balance in his address by endorsing the Arabs' demand for territorial concessions from Israel and at the same time defining "peace" in terms that delighted the Israelis. But the United States will have to play a less even-handed role than those comments implied if the conference is to succeed.
As Michael Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations pointed out, Israel "will be asked to give up a tangible security asset" -- territory that it has occupied as a buffer against its enemies -- "in exchange for something that is intangible and revocable: in effect, for a promise."
Only if the United States offers assurances of various kinds to Israel, many analysts believe, will Israeli public opinion propel the hard-line government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir toward genuine bargaining. The President pledged today that if necessary Washington would "extend guarantees, provide technology and support, if that is what peace requires."
 
'Peace Is Possible'
 Mr. Baker and others are ready, once the various participants have spelled out their positions in full, and especially if they reach an early deadlock, to try to inject some new ideas into the negotiations subtly, while at the same time carefully avoiding the elaboration of settlement plans that would only turn into targets for one side or the other to shoot down.
"We want to make them do the bargaining," a high-ranking American official said, "and we think each of them is sufficiently worried about looking like villains to the rest of the world to take this seriously."
"Peace is possible," Mr. Bush said, noting that France and Germany had become allies after a hundred years of war, and that the Soviet Union stood alongside the United States as a sponsor here despite the legacy of the cold war. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain recalled how Christians, Jews and Arabs had lived together in harmony in this country until the Moors and the Jews were driven out in the year Christopher Columbus set sail.
It is a matter of mustering the will to try, a matter of taking chances, as Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet did in seeking European unity after World War II. One thing that could help to scatter the ghosts of distrust and hatred would be some sort of gesture from one side or the other, like President Anwar el-Sadat's trip to Israel in 1977, that would help to "break the fetters of the past," in Mr. Gorbachev's phrase. But there was no sign of that from either side today.
Instead, presented by the American organizers with an opportunity to fraternize during the 30 minutes that they waited in the marble hall for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev to arrive, the Arab delegates turned their backs on the Jews, and vice versa, except for the Egyptians, who have a special status. If the very convening of the conference was a good omen, the frostiness of the participants' demeanor constituted an offsetting note of pessimism.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Gas Mileage and Safety, Or Statistics in Collision

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
As Congress takes up a proposal to increase gas mileage requirements sharply, all sides in the debate have churned out so much devilishly detailed data to support their respective views that the basic facts have become impossible to determine.
There is a lot riding on fuel economy in automobiles: smog, the global climate, the trade deficit, the job market, the Middle East and the size of the family car to the highway mortality rate. 
 But the issue immediately before Congress is whether automobile manufacturers ought to be required by law to increase the average gas mileage of cars from today's 27.5 miles per gallon to 34 miles a gallon in 1996 and 40 miles a gallon in 2001, as proposed by Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada. A House bill would go even further. The Bush Administration supports a Senate energy bill that would leave fuel economy standards to the discretion of the Transportation Department.
To appreciate the complexities of the debate, examine one proposition seized on by the legislation's opponents, which include the auto industry and the Administration -- the claim that saving gas would cost lives.
"Everybody has got their numbers and statistics," said Brian O'Neill of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, one of many sources of the statistics on fatalities and car size.
The institute has produced statistics showing that every one-mile-per-gallon improvement in fuel economy translates into a 3.9 percent increase in the death rate from auto accidents.
Reasoning that to meet strict mileage standards auto makers would have to sell smaller cars than they do now, Transportation Department officials last year labeled the Bryan legislation the "Highway Fatality Act." They cited what they said was irrefutable statistical evidence based on laws of physics to show that, all other things being equal, smaller cars are more dangerous than larger ones.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, smaller cars built partly to comply with existing mileage statutes have already cost "nearly 2,000" lives a year since 1974.
Now the data of the insurance institute and the highway safety agency alike have been challenged.
Last week the General Accounting Office reported that its own statistical findings "support the view that the automobile weight reductions since the mid-1970's have had virtually no effect on total highway fatalities."
And the Office of Technology Assessment said two weeks ago that even if cars get smaller they are likely to get safer. "Given enough time, auto makers can significantly improve fleet fuel economy without downsizing, though with some weight reduction, and without any likely safety impact," the agency said.
The accounting office did not address the question of whether tougher gas mileage laws would force auto makers to build smaller cars. The technology agency's report said that if the Bryan bill is approved its 1996 deadline for reaching 34 miles per gallon "probably is unattainable without a significant shift in sales to smaller vehicles."
Not surprisingly, the G.A.O. report was made public by Senator Bryan, who said it was "clear and devastating to the bogus arguments against improving automobile fuel economy standards." The technology agency's report was issued by Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who favors its less aggressive schedule for tightening fuel efficiency.
The insurance institute then cranked out an analysis disputing the G.A.O. findings, just as it had earlier rebutted the statistics used in the technology agency's report.
And where does the Administration stand in these data wars?
Transportation Department officials contend that both the technology agency and the accounting office studies are "flawed." The department has its own study under way, being done by the National Academy of Sciences. Luckily for the Administration, which does not want the energy bill to include any fixed target for fuel efficiency, that study will not be completed until the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Bridge

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
With millions of bridge hands played around the world each year, there is no sure way to determine which declarer has exercised the greatest skill. However, the International Bridge Press Association makes an attempt. A committee headed by Dirk Schroeder of Germany reviewed a number of candidates, and at a meeting in Yokohama, Japan, early this month the diagramed deal was named "Hand of the Year." It was played in Athens in April at the European Economic Community Championships. The declarer was Schmuel Friedman, playing for Israel in a match against Belgium.
Three no-trump was an obvious contract, but after a spade lead it was not easy to find nine tricks. After winning in dummy South led a club to the jack and was happy and surprised to find that he had won the trick. There were now eight tricks in view, with various chances of a ninth. Looking at all four hands, it is easy to find the ninth in the diamond suit, but that was not obvious to South. 
 Continuing clubs immediately would have allowed East to win and return a spade, with the ninth trick still in doubt. A better plan was to cash the spade winners, lead to the club ace and play a club, but that plan was due to fail if West began with five spades and the heart ace.
South found an even better play. He took one more round of spades, led to the club ace and continued that suit, throwing the remaining high spade from the dummy. This kept the spades under control, and if East were able to lead a third spade he would give South the extra entry he needed to establish his fifth club. And if East returned a red suit he would give South his ninth trick in that way.
Two new duplicate games are now active in the New York metropolitan area: Y.W.C.A., 515 North Street, White Plains, at 8 P.M. Fridays and 1:15 P.M. Saturdays; Barbizon Hotel, 140 East 63d Street, Manhattan, 12:30 P.M. Monday, 7:15 P.M. Wednesdays and 7:15 P.M. Fridays.

HEADLINE: Tartikoff Begins Charting New Course For Paramount Films

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Brandon Tartikoff, the chairman of the Paramount Pictures Corporation, said today that the dismal financial showing of the studio's latest releases, "Frankie and Johnny" and "The Butcher's Wife," had led to a fundamental reassessment of the kinds of films he would make as he solidified control of one of Hollywood's most powerful studios.
Instead of movies intended for an older audience, Mr. Tartikoff said he planned to make films that appeal to younger audiences, who make up the bulk of moviegoers today. He cited movies with music, like "Saturday Night Fever" and "Footloose," major successes that drew huge young audiences. 
 "Paramount has a successful tradition of being the studio known for the modern-day musical," he said in a surprisingly frank telephone interview. "You can almost call 'Top Gun' a musical, too. It had a wall-to-wall soundtrack of music and action. Paramount owns the modern-day musical crowd, just as Disney owns the animation crowd."
"While there is a place for the adult film, or for pictures that don't necessarily have to be made for the most frequent moviegoers -- 25 and under -- you don't want an abundance of pictures clearly tilted to viewers 25 and up," Mr. Tartikoff said.
He cited recent Paramount films including "Regarding Henry" and "Soapdish," as well as "The Butcher's Wife" and "Frankie and Johnny," that were made before he took over Paramount and that appealed to a limited audience.
"Some of these were very satisfying pictures," he said. "But this was making movies primarily for women over 25. In a recession, the people most affected will be the least frequent moviegoers -- the older audience. If you aim for this audience, you better hit the bull's-eye, or else they say, 'Hey, I'll wait for the video.' "
 
'Frustrated? You Bet'
 Mr. Tartikoff, the former president of NBC Entertainment, who took over Paramount Pictures nearly four months ago, is plainly disturbed that the studio did not hit the bull's-eye with "Frankie and Johnny," a gentle love story about a short-order cook and a waitress. The film, which received generally good reviews and has two major stars, Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino, cost about $30 million. According to Daily Variety, it dropped off 30 percent in revenues last week and has so far grossed an extremely disappointing $13 million.
"Are we considering what happened or didn't happen to this movie?" Mr. Tartikoff said. "You bet we are. Are we frustrated? You bet we are. It's a terrific movie. If you woke me up from a deep sleep after three or four weeks into the run and I asked how 'Frankie and Johnny' was doing, and you told me $40 million gross, I would have expected it. Some of us are scratching our heads."
He added: "We ask ourselves, is the recession so deep now that a picture like this has a much tougher time getting an audience because it is a one-quadrant kind of picture -- that is, viewers 25-plus -- or is it the picture itself not appealing to the audience?"
Mr. Tartikoff said the televised hearings before the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, as well as the World Series, may have diminished moviegoing on recent weekends.
About "The Butcher's Wife," a comedy with Demi Moore, which cost at least $20 million and received mixed reviews, Mr. Tartikoff said: "We knew it was a soft comedy. We did not have expectations as high as 'Frankie and Johnny.' " He said it was hoped that future Paramount films would appeal to "the widest possible audience."
"Look at a movie like 'Ghost,' " he said. "A 10-year-old kid will see it. My mother will see it. Men will see it. Ethnic audiences will see it."
 
Departures Expected
 Mr. Tartikoff declined to discuss what is virtually an open secret in Hollywood: that he is about to remove his two top movie executives at Paramount, David Kirkpatrick, the head of the motion picture division, and Gary Lucchesi, the president of production. The two are holdovers from the administration of Frank Mancuso, who was dismissed in March after a series of lavish films, including "The Godfather Part III" and "Days of Thunder," that were financial disappointments.
But the two executives' departures, expected for several months, have not been announced, and the huge studio is somewhat adrift, say agents, producers and writers. Scott Rudin, producer of the new "Addams Family," is believed to be a front-runner for Mr. Kirkpatrick's job.
Many agents, producers, writers and actors have generally refrained from dealing with Paramount -- unless they have personal connections with Mr. Tartikoff -- because of the looming turmoil and the fact that the executive who may approve a project today may be out the door tomorrow.
Mr. Tartikoff said heatedly that the talk of paralysis at Paramount was "wrong." Last week, he met stock-market analysts with Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount Communications, and disclosed plans for 30 films. As a result, three Wall Street investment firms raised their evaluation of Paramount stock.
 
Early Decisions
 Among his accomplishments at Paramount, Mr. Tartikoff can already count the wooing of Eddie Murphy into a contract extension. Mr. Murphy was openly unhappy with the money and scripts Paramount had offered before Mr. Tartikoff took over. Even though the actor's career has stumbled of late, it would have been a major setback for Mr. Tartikoff if he had broken off his longstanding relationship with the studio.
Moreover, Mr. Tartikoff has played hardball with temperamental actors. When Alec Baldwin, who created the role of the Navy officer in "The Hunt for Red October," demanded changes in the starting date of the sequel, "Patriot Games," Paramount startled the actor -- and the industry -- by replacing him with Harrison Ford.
Producers and studio executives say it is far too early to assess Mr. Tartikoff as a movie mogul. "All he needs is a couple of hits; he doesn't need an Academy Award," said Howard Rosenman, the producer of the new films "Father of the Bride" and "Shining Through."
Mr. Tartikoff acknowledges that he has puzzled the industry with some of his pronouncements and decisions, including his first move as chairman: to make a cheap, quick Christmas movie, "All I Want for Christmas," which opens Nov. 8. Another early decision was to make "Wayne's World," a "Saturday Night Live" spinoff scheduled to open in February.
"We know this is a very tough market now, and I can't tell you I've learned all the lessons yet," he said. "There's this divided debate going on. Where does the economy leave off and the quality of the pictures take over? Is it the product or the pocketbook? We don't know."

HEADLINE: Record Number In U.S. Relying On Food Stamps

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
As a tangible sign of the deepening economic troubles afflicting American families, the number of people receiving Federal food stamps jumped to a record level in August, meaning that almost one in 10 Americans now depend on the Government to put food on the table.
According to figures made public today by the United States Department of Agriculture, 23.6 million Americans received food stamps in August, an increase of more than 3 million over the same month last year. 
 To specialists, these numbers suggest that the economy is slipping back into recession. But for many working Americans, they confirm that poverty and hunger are no longer just problems of the inner city or the hollows of Appalachia and instead have now spread out into middle class suburbs.
In Sudbury, a middle-class suburb 15 miles west of Boston, Brian Carnevale, the assistant manager of the local Star Market, said he has seen a fivefold increase in customers using food stamps over the past year. "They are just average customers," he said, "a lot of people who worked in the high-tech industry who have recently lost their jobs."
 
Recipients Defy Stereotypes
 "They are young and old, people in business suits," Mr. Carnevale said, standing inside his large red brick store with a white steeple to match the traditional New England architecture of the neighborhood. "And you're going to see more and more of them," he predicted, noting that nearby electronics companies like the Raytheon Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation are in the midst of the worst layoffs in their history.
But the voices of people who are getting food stamps tell a more vivid story than do the dry numbers.
In Passaic, N.J., today, Linda Porter, a 20-year-old single mother of two boys, aged 2 and 4, was buying groceries with food stamps. "Believe me, they help," she said. "You can buy the food you need and still get to keep some cash in your pockets."
"I used to be ashamed, but not anymore," Ms. Porter said. "They really come in handy."
In Manhattan, Nora Quinones, who works as a seamstress in the garment district, is getting food stamps for the first time. She said it was because she was recently divorced and needs the extra help to feed her 8-year-old son. "I have to pay the rent," she said.
In Connecticut, the number of households receiving food stamps increased by 33 percent in the past year, according to the state's department of income maintenance; in New Jersey, the increase in households was 17 percent in the past year. New York State keeps its figures by people, not households, and showed a 12 percent increase in the past year.
While some of the heaviest concentrations of people enrolled in the food stamp program remain in economically depressed metropolitan areas, the sharp rise in middle-class recipients has struck many experts.
"We're getting calls from people who have always had a full work history and never needed public assistance of any kind," said Karen Plattes, the coordinator of the food stamp outreach program for Project Bread, a private, nonprofit agency in Boston.
"Many of them are reluctant to apply," Ms. Plattes said. In fact, she said many of those who have asked her for help applying for food stamps had used up their unemployment benefits as much as six months earlier, meaning they had been out of work for a year.
 
Sharp Rise Since 1970
 The number of Americans getting food stamps has sharply climbed since the early days of the program. In 1970 only about 2 in 100 Americans received them. In 1980 the number had reached 9 in 100. Now it is close to 10 of 100.
The specialists point out that more than 80 percent of those getting food stamps are families with children, making it a major antihunger program for children.
In Ms. Plattes's office, which serves towns and cities throughout Massachusetts, one of the states hardest hit by the recession, the number of calls for assistance in getting food stamps has doubled over the past year, to about 1,200 a month from about 600 a month, she said.
One of those who called, a woman from the affluent oceanside suburb of Marshfield, 20 miles south of Boston, earned $90,000 last year, Ms. Plattes said. The woman had lost her job and had no money in the bank. She would have qualified for food stamps, except that her car was too expensive, Ms. Plattes said.
Recipients of food stamps can have assets of only about $2,000, excluding their homes. The value of their cars is not counted if the vehicle is worth less than $4,500.
To qualify for food stamps, a program started by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960's, families also cannot have an income that exceeds 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines, or $1,117 a month for a family of four, according to the Department of Agriculture.
The average benefit for each person for each meal, assuming three meals a day, is only 65 cents, according to figures compiled by the Senate Agriculture Committee.
A family could receive both unemployment benefits and food stamps if it qualifies. Unlike unemployment benefits, which run out after six months, there is no limit on the amount of time a family can receive food stamps.
A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service, Phil Shanholtzer, said that Congress had provided a $1.5 billion "cushion" in the budget, in case of an increase in the number of people using food stamps, and he said that amount should cover the sharp rise in recipients this year. The program cost $19.6 billion in fiscal year 1991, and food assistance programs now make up more than half of the Agriculture Department's budget, he said.
The Federal Government pays the entire cost of food stamp benefits, and administrative costs are shared by Washington and the states.
Mr. Shanholtzer insisted there "is probably no single explanation" for the big increase in food stamp recipients this year. He said "the economy is certainly a factor in some areas." But he said there were some other possible causes, including the Government's efforts to make the application process easier and changes in the immigration laws, which had created more permanent resident aliens, who are eligible for food stamps.
But some Democrats were quick to jump on the new figures as a sign that the Bush Administration has failed the economy. "This is proof of what most Americans already know, and the Administration wants to ignore," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
Until this spring, the number of people receiving food stamps had hit its peak in March 1983, at 22.6 million, the Agriculture Department figures show. Last March it reached 22.9 million, and it remained relatively stable until the new high of 23.6 million in August.

HEADLINE: Campaign on Term Limits Taps a Gusher of Money

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 30

 BODY:
For all the debate over what placing limits on politicians' terms of office would do for American democracy, the money now pouring into the campaign for the most restrictive such measure ever to go before a state's voters tells an altogether different story.
Billed by its supporters as a prairie fire of populism, the term limit proposal on the Nov. 5 ballot in Washington State has been bankrolled by a group founded by a handful of wealthy, out-of-state industrialists with a conservative political agenda. Two brothers, David H. Koch and Charles G. Koch, listed by Fortune magazine as among the 20 richest men in the world, are the main financial backers of the group leading the push for term limits. 
 On the other side, money against the term limits is coming from some of the nation's most powerful lobbies, among them the National Rifle Association, Philip Morris Companies, and Anheuser-Busch Companies, representing guns, tobacco and alcohol interests.
The Washington measure, Initiative 553, would limit members of the United States House of Representatives to three two-year terms -- a law that would throw out all eight members of the state's Congressional delegation three years after the vote. It would end the legislative career of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, restrict United States Senators to two terms and force 74 of the 98 members of this state's House of Representatives to step down after the 1994 session.
Although three states, California, Oklahoma and Colorado, have already voted to limit terms, only Colorado's law applies to Federal officials. Only in Washington would the limits be retroactive. Mr. Foley, joined by many legal scholars, contends that the states cannot limit the terms of Federal office holders, although the precise language in the Constitution is unclear on that point.
As the term limits movement sweeps across the West, pushed by a mood of voter disgust, the lowest approval ratings for Congress in modern times and scandals about bounced checks and meals not paid for, the money going into the campaigns has challenged the arguments of both sides.
 
A Grass-Roots Beginning
 The movement in this state began as a genuine grass-roots effort, drafted in the Tacoma living room of Sherry Bockwinkel, who has been active in liberal political campaigns. But the initiative, which needed at least 150,000 voter signatures by July to qualify for the November ballot, was going nowhere until a group called Citizens for Congressional Reform stepped in with thousands of dollars and expert political help.
That group, based in Washington, D.C., was started with several hundred thousand dollars donated by David Koch, who with his brother Charles controls Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan., the nation's largest privately held oil company. The Justice Department has been investigating the company after allegations that it stole millions of dollars in oil from Indian-owned lands, an allegation that David Koch says is groundless.
Money from Citizens for Congressional Reform was used to pay professional signature gatherers from out of state who got 40 cents a signature -- something that had never before been done with a voter initiative that usually has a number on the ballot each November. As of early this week, $543,000 of the $740,000 raised by the term limits drive, or 73 percent, has come from one source, Citizens for Congressional Reform and its state branch. Less than 10 percent of the supporters' money is from Washington State, said Paul Gillie, an analyst with the state Public Disclosure Commission, to which contributions must be reported. The political parties are not among the top contributors, commission figures showed.
"I ignited the spark, and the fire is raging on its own," David Koch said in an interview.
 
Benefit to Republicans Seen
 Mr. Koch also helped to start Citizens for a Sound Economy, the parent organization of the term limits organization. This group, whose chairman is James C. Miller 3d, who was budget director under President Ronald Reagan, has pushed for less government regulation, fewer taxes and converting some public industries to private enterprises.
Mr. Miller said in an interview that term limits were likely to result in reduced Federal spending and in the election of more Republicans. But his group, he said, is nonpartisan.
"This is a sagebrush revolution," he said. "It is not an attempt to get Republican majorities. And it would be a tragedy if it loses because of a last-minute attempt to discredit the process."
Thomas Mann, director of government studies at the Brookings Institute, said the term limits proposal here, and the ones likely to be on the ballot in a dozen states next year, were a false form of populism. "There is a hidden agenda here that has been lost in all the rhetoric," he said. "The money is coming from groups whose primary interest is to weaken government -- a carefully calculated effort to go after those institutions dominated by Democrats."
Ms. Bockwinkel, a self-professed liberal Democrat, scoffs at such assertions. Even though conservative millionaires are responsible for her initiative's getting on the ballot, she said, nobody knows how government will change with term limits. She expects to see more "genuine Democrats," as she calls the more liberal members, in office.
Dr. David J. Olson, a professor of political science at the University of Washington, has done a study of the campaign here, and he concluded that genuine populism had little to do with the drive.
"This effort would never have made it on the ballot without the assistance of one out-of-state group," he said. "That is extraordinary for Washington State. This is an elite-centered campaign on both sides."
Dr. Olson said the contributions against term limits tended to bolster an argument that the so-called special interests which dominate Congressional campaigns have the most to lose with the loss of long-term incumbents.
The top contributor against the initiative has been Philip Morris U.S.A., which makes Marlboro cigarettes. Philip Morris gave $25,000, or about 10 percent of what opponents of term limits have raised.
 
Opponents Have Definite Goals
 When asked why a tobacco company based in New York City was so interested in defeating term limits in Washington State, Victor Han, a company spokesman, said they were asked by the opponents to contribute. In addition, he said, the company believes "voters should be able to choose the leaders they want."
Another major contributor, the National Rifle Association, gave $10,000 to try to defeat Initiative 553. A council of unions, a lawyers' group and Kaiser Aluminum, a large employer with plants in the state are among the top 10 contributors against the initiative. Also contributing to opponents of the initiative is the state's largest employer, the Boeing Company. Paul Binder, a spokesman for Boeing, the largest employer in the state, said the company feared terms limits could reduce the power of Washington representatives.
No matter the outcome of the vote next Tuesday, the initiative has already had a domino effect on politics in Washington, the second most populous state in the West. Last week a seven-term Representative from northwestern Washington, Al Swift, who is an influential Democrat in the House, announced that he would leave Congress after one more term beginning next year. He said he made his announcement now so he would be free to campaign against the initiative without being accused of just helping himself.

Making Giants Stadium a Part of the '94 World Cup

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 30

 BODY:
The world governing body of soccer is determined to make Giants Stadium an integral part of the 1994 World Cup tournament despite the need for drastic changes there and a lack of funds to implement them.
That message was made abundantly clear late this afternoon by members of an inspection committee from FIFA, the governing body, who spoke enthusiastically about a special concept planned for the stadium.
 
Contributions Cited
 "This stadium must be part of the tournament," said Guido Tognoni, FIFA's press officer and a member of the inspection committee. "We're making a lot of inspections and have nice things to say about everyone, but this site cannot be left out of the world's biggest sports event." 
 Tognoni said the metropolitan area had contributed a great deal to soccer in this country. He added that the World Cup in the United States would not be the same without representation from the stadium, the home of the Cosmos, the most successful team in the old North American Soccer League.
 
A Test in Kansas City
 In order to meet the required 80-by-100-meter field dimensions required for World Cup soccer games, an elevated platform will be built above the existing football field. The platform, which will reach the level of the first row of seats (about 10 feet above the football field) will support 6 to 10 inches of soil and a natural grass field.
 Security for players and officials will be provided, according to the plan, by dasher boards similar to those in a hockey rink around the perimeter of the grass field.
"It's a radical and unique situation," said Hugo Salcedo, who worked for FIFA's organizing commitee in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and last year in Italy.
The estimated cost for the field modifications is $2.6 to $3 million, according to a Pam Scott, a Kansas City architect whose firm came up with the idea of the platform.
Scott said the idea had been successfully tested with a 40-foot-by-40-foot platform complete with grass at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, but that it had not been tried at larger dimensions.
The question of who would finance the project was referred to George Zoffinger, the New Jersey Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development. He said the money would come from the private sector, not from the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which runs the Meadowlands complex.
 
Public Funds Can't Be Used
 "Governor Florio has made it clear that the state will not be able to use public funds for this," Zoffinger said. "The money will have to be raised from the private sector."
When he was told that some had estimated the cost at $5 million, Zoffinger said, "We're operating with the idea that this will cost $3 million." He added that the money had to be raised by Feb. 1.
Michael Rowe, the executive vice president of the exposition authority, said Giants Stadium would lose $3 million in revenues from events such as concerts during the time needed for renovation of the stadium and for whatever World Cup games would be played there. The tournament is scheduled to be played from June 17 to July 17, 1994 at several sites. The inspection committee is touring stadiums throughout the country in an effort to select the venues.
 
Yale Bowl to Be Inspected
 The committee inspected Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia Tuesday and will see the Yale Bowl in New Haven on Thursday. Members said it was possible for both Giants Stadium and Yale Bowl to be used.
The United States World Cup Organizing Committee has maintained since the start of the bidding process that the games would be staged in between 8 and 12 cities.
Ross Berlin, who is in charge of the venues, reiterated that again today, but Tognoni said that FIFA wanted the 1994 tournament to be played in 12 cities.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
HIS mother was a well-known surgeon. His father was a university professor. His older siblings were either doctors or lawyers. The family had similar expectations for him.
But after the young man graduated from a prestigious medical school, he decided to become a carpenter. 
 The concept of upward mobility has been intregral to this country. Generations of American parents have assumed that their children would equal or surpass them financially, socially and professionally. If a young adult fails to do so or does not want to, it is often seen as a sign that something is wrong.
"The remarkable thing is that the dream of upward mobility didn't die during the Great Depression," said Dr. Christopher Lasch, a professor of history at the University of Rochester who has studied changes in social expectations.
But the assumption that the next generation will be better off is no longer valid. Growing numbers of adults who were raised in middle-class families are finding it difficult to reach their parents' level of financial and professional success. The former guarantors of success, like getting an education and having family connections, do not work as well now and, in some cases, are being rejected by the younger generation.
"Just because you've paid for your child's college degree doesn't mean that it's going to have the occupational payoff that you expected," said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University. "This is in stark contrast to the parents' generation's experience, especially those parents who began their careers in the 50's and 60's."
Although many people blame changes in the economy for the shift in financial and professional achievement, psychologists and other family experts say it is much more complex. Some young adults deliberately pursue a different path that is less financially rewarding.
"It's not just that opportunities aren't as abundant as they were or that it's more difficult to buy a house," Dr. Lasch said. "Professional and business careers have lost some of their luster. The new generation is questioning whether the results are worth the struggle, the costs and the pain."
When a child chooses a less prestigious career, parents might interpret it as a sign of their own failure. "Many times, parents see this as a rejection of all that they've worked for," said Dr. Harold D. Grotevant, a professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota. "But it means that you've raised children who are independent enough to know what's best for them."
No government or private agency keeps statistics on downward social mobility. It is most obvious, however, among the children of high-achieving parents, those who would have the easiest time succeeding because of their families' money, connections and power.
Dr. Steven Berglas, a clinical psychologist at the Harvard Medical School, has found that children are sometimes intimidated by the professional and social success of their parents. Rather than compete with parents they see as infallible, they sabotage themselves. "I sometimes encourage parents to do what I call a 'strategic pratfall,' " Dr. Berglas said. "Let your child see that you do some things poorly, especially if it's something that your child does better than you. That helps him realize that you each have your own talents."
Choosing not to follow the example of successful parents is a way for children to assert their individuality. "You can't be a Carnegie and beat out Andrew," Dr. Berglas said. "You have to follow a different track."
 
What is Success? Generations Disagree
 PSYCHOLOGISTS are quick to emphasize the difference between young adults who are lazy and those who have values and aspirations different from their parents'. Here are some things to keep in mind if you are concerned about your child's choice of career.
Expect your children to experiment with different careers.
The first decision a child makes is not a permanent commitment. "I'd be careful as a parent not to do things that make it look like you won't tolerate that type of experimentation; it will backfire," said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University.
Look at your assumptions about what constitutes success.
"Another way to think about upward mobility is to look at life satisfaction instead of money, power or prestige," Dr. Steinberg said. "If you can persuade yourself that you've done a great job as a parent because your child is happier or more satisfied than you were at that age, that will help."
Remember that you cannot deny with your words what you assert with your actions.
Pay attention to any discrepancy between what you say to your child about work and the way you treat your own career.
"Every child I've treated for underachievement has had parents who said that they never pushed their children to achieve," said Dr. Steven Berglas, a clinical psychologist at the Harvard Medical School. "But the children pick up those expectations by watching their parents work 60-hour weeks. That tells children that career success is critical."
Encourage your child's financial independence.
Parents sometimes need to tread a fine line here. Even the most talented artist or musician will probably need an outside source of income for a few years. But paying part of young adults' rent can make them feel even more dependent at a time when they are struggling with their identity. And immature young adults whose financial needs are met by their parents have little motivation to break out of a childhood role.
"You have to distinguish between a child who is pursuing a bona fide occupation versus one who's just goofing off," Dr. Steinberg said.
Don't focus on your children's careers as reflections of their worth.
This is difficult for parents who have devoted much of their lives to their own careers.
"There's overwhelming evidence that children take on the fundamental values of their parents," said Dr. Harold D. Grotevant, a professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota. "And that's what's really important."

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:

* A commercial that advocates an extension of unemployment benefits has appeared on four television stations in Washington and Charleston, W. Va., this week, after being refused by six others in Houston and Washington. The spot, produced by Citizen Action, a consumer group, depicts a newly unemployed husband and wife writing a letter to President Bush asking him not to veto the bill granting added weeks of unemployment benefits. Several of the stations that declined the spot say they do not accept issue-oriented advertising.
 
* Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin' Donuts and Nestle Food have agreed to stop advertising and marketing campaigns suggesting that certain of their products are healthy, low-fat alternatives to their regular fare. The agreement was reached with Robert Abrams, New York State attorney general.
 

* A set of advertising industry "green principles" is scheduled to be presented today at the Advertising Age Green Marketing West conference in San Francisco. Along with support of recycling and environmental education programs within agencies, the initiatives ask signers to encourage their clients and vendors "to make a commitment to environmental responsibility." The statement has been signed by top executives from Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide, Altschiller Reitzfeld/Tracy-Locke and other agencies, and is being circulated at the conference.
 
* TBWA Advertising Inc., New York, and Carat, London, have formed a media joint venture called Eurospace. It will provide media planning, buying and research services to all of the agency's clients in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Holland and Belgium as well as selected clients in the United Kingdom.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Finally Facing Facts

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
When Alan Greenspan offered an optimistic economic forecast in July, he was careful to hedge; recovery, he said, "could be muted or even falter." This was scarcely noticed in the euphoria of the Fed chairman's conclusion that the recession was over and election year 1992 would see a growth rate of 2 to 3 percent.
More than three months later, Mr. Greenspan has confirmed the hedge rather than the prediction. He said the economy was "demonstrably sluggish" though moving forward; and the optimism of July was notably missing from his October speech to business executives in Rhode Island. 
 This follows President Bush's brief show of concern for the domestic situation, and his renewed call for his favorite panacea, a capital gains tax reduction. The onset of 1992 may more nearly have been at work than real alarm over a lagging economy, but let us judge not that we be not judged; he may have decided belatedly that he wants to be "the economy President" too.
Numerous polls show that the public is not optimistic about the economy, wants something done and is beginning to question why Mr. Bush does not spend as much time on the Middle West as on the Middle East. These concerns surely are not lost on Mario Cuomo, as he ponders anew the question of running for President.
On Capitol Hill, too, the economic climate suddenly is being viewed with nearly as much alarm as is usually lavished on the deficit. Numerous tax-cut proposals have been offered, mostly by Democrats, for "jump-starting" the economy. You're nearing Social Security if you can remember when it was called "pump-priming."
By whatever name, economic stimulus is needed; but tax cuts are not well designed for this job. For one thing, they take a lot of time to be enacted and to have stimulative effect; for another, they can't stimulate if they have to be offset by cuts in government spending, as the present "budget agreement" requires and as current proposals recognize.
Mr. Greenspan is being urged, particularly by the Bush Administration, to cut interest rates further; but that won't help much either. The real problem is that too many potential consumers are out of work or fearful of layoff, hence have no money to spend or are guarding what they have. Too many businessmen, in such a climate, are afraid even to seek loans to start or expand businesses and provide new jobs.
As John Kenneth Galbraith, the liberal economist, put it in a recent speech to the National Press Club, interest rates can work against inflation because "then you are pulling on the string. Against recession, you are shoving on the string."
But at least Congress, the Fed and even the White House are finally facing the facts that almost any householder or businessman or laid-off worker has known for months -- the recession is not over, the recovery, if any, is indeed muted and faltering, a lot of Americans are in bad shape and afraid things are getting worse, and something needs to be done.
The economy I described in this space in August is more "sluggish" now: "Jobs are disappearing, layoffs are up, consumption is down, unemployment is nearly 7 percent, retail sales are lagging, real estate is a disaster area, banks are failing, credit is tight, wages are stagnant. . . ."
Outside the Beltway, moreover, states and cities are being hit from one side by recession and falling revenues, and from the other by Federal aid drastically reduced in obeisance to right-wing theology. The result, from New York to California, is rising state and local taxes, declining state and local services and spending, extensive state and local worker layoffs -- all deflationary.
If Congress could get over its deficit hysteria, if the Fed were not so spooked by the ghost of inflation, if Mr. Bush really meant business, the dreaded S-word -- spending -- might not seem so evil. Billions poured, for example, into highways, bridges, sewers and other needed infrastructural improvements would provide jobs, increase purchasing power, reduce outlays for unemployment, stimulate business, raise revenues, train workers, take the idle off the streets. In the largely forgotten long term, that kind of investment in America might even reduce a deficit swollen in the short term by recession.
If that be heresy, what has orthodoxy done for you lately?

HEADLINE: A Vote for Democracy

 BODY:
America's active participation in democracy is dwindling. Barely half the eligible voters took part in the 1988 Presidential election -- the lowest rate in 64 years. The turnout in non-Presidential years is smaller still.
A bill that would help reverse this ominous trend is now threatened with a Senate filibuster. The bill won't even make it to the floor unless the favorable votes of 60 senators can be mustered today to close off debate on a motion to proceed. Senators who care about enlarging democracy will vote yes. 
 Why is turnout so low? Uninspiring campaigns are surely a factor. But the problem begins with simple arithmetic: Only 60 percent of eligible voters are registered. The "motor-voter" bill sponsored by Senator Wendell Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, could boost that figure tremendously -- to an estimated 90 percent -- by requiring states to enable qualified citizens to register when they apply for a driver's license. States would also be required to permit registration by mail and to make registration forms available at public agencies like welfare and unemployment offices.
Action on the measure, similar to one passed by the House last year, was blocked by Senate Republicans this summer by a single vote. But obstructionism needn't prevail if the lonely Republican supporters pick up a few allies, like Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Bob Packwood of Oregon.
Opponents of the "motor-voter" measure exaggerate its costs and the chance for increased voting fraud. What cannot be exaggerated is the cost, to democracy, of standing still.

HEADLINE: Bond Proposition Will Help New York Recover

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On Election Day, Nov. 5, the people of New York State have the opportunity to put New York on the road to economic recovery. Proposition 1 on the ballot will allow the State Legislature to increase the Job Development Authority's authorization of state bonds from $600 million to $900 million. This power to extend low-interest loans to companies looking to expand in New York State has proved to be a valuable economic tool in stimulating economic growth. 
 The reluctance to reform the Medicaid and Social Service programs has produced billion-dollar budget deficits that were filled with tax increases and cutbacks in state services. This trend has got to stop. Increasing the Job Development Authority's bonding authorization is a good first step to reverse that trend. Since the agency's inception almost 150,000 people have become employed by companies assisted by its loans. New York can be an attractive place to do business. But in these tough economic times many companies do not have the necessary capital to expand and create new jobs.
Approving Proposition 1 is a necessary first step for putting New York State on the road to economic recovery.
