HEADLINE: Repaying the Piper

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The last week's declines in bond and stock prices generated a momentum of their own, divorced from the economy's generally upbeat performance. The momentum was fed in large part by big investors who had borrowed heavily to buy securities, gambling incorrectly that interest rates would stay down. As rates rose instead, the investors have been forced to sell their securities to cover their debts.
While the American economy has been healthier in the last six months than at any time since 1989, no one could tell that from the way the markets have behaved. Half a dozen factors, most of them unrelated to the economy and some accidental, have dragged down the markets. Losses by American investors in German bonds played a role. And tensions over trade with Japan and China made the markets nervous. But these are small-fry factors. 
 "The tinder for this fire has basically been speculation, using borrowed money on a global basis," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street bond trading firm.
The selloff -- which included a drop in the Dow Jones industrial average of nearly 9 percent from early February until yesterday, when the Dow rose slightly -- is another example of how Wall Street has ignored the lessons of previous plunges. In the 1987 stock market crash, for instance, borrowing to finance speculation contributed to the 508-point collapse.
This time, bonds rather than stocks have been at center stage. "But the leverage explanation is central," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist who analyzes markets. Those who borrowed to speculate in effect gambled that bond prices would remain high and interest rates low -- or, if the reverse occurred, that bond prices would fall slowly enough for them to sell and get out without losses.
"Everyone had the same idea, and now they are being forced to liquidate," said Nicholas Sargen, chief investment officer for Global Advisers, a unit of Prudential Insurance that invests mostly in bonds.
For several years, until early February, the system worked. Pension funds, insurance companies, banks, corporations, individuals and money managers found ideal conditions. They could borrow money for, say, six months and pay only about 3 percent a year in interest charges on the loans.
Taking $300,000 of his own money, for example, an investor could borrow an additional $4.7 million for six months, paying 3 percent interest. The investor could then purchase 30year Treasury bonds for $5 million. These long-term bonds earned 6 percent interest -- a neat profit of 3 percent beyond the cost of the money borrowed to purchase them.
Most important, when the loan came due in six months, the investor could be confident that the bonds would still be worth $5 million. He could renew his loan without problem and his long-term investment was safe.
 
 
Borrowing Kept Rising
 That process, which goes under several names -- margin loans is the most common -- continued largely without incident until early this year, and the borrowing rose into hundreds of billions of dollars. No one knows how much was involved because no Government agency tracks these loans, although many came from banks.
What is more, the Federal Reserve abetted the investors by holding down interest rates. The Fed's goal was not to encourage speculation, but to stimulate the economy by encouraging borrowing, to make certain a weak and drawn-out recovery from the 1990-91 recession did not peter out.
 As long as the interest rates on bonds stayed down, their value or price stayed up. The price of a 30-year bond falls if its interest rate goes to 7 percent or more from 6 percent -- as the rate has since early February. The reason is that the owner of 6 percent bonds has trouble selling them. Why should anyone spend $5 million to buy bonds paying 6 percent interest, or $300,000, when he or she can buy bonds paying 7 percent, or $350,000 a year, for the same $5 million?
To lure a buyer to the 6 percent bonds, the holder has to lower his price to $4.3 million. The new buyer still gets only $300,000 in annual interest payments. But for a $4.3 million investment, that $300,000 now represents a 7 percent return. The rate, in effect, has risen as the price has fallen.
The problem is that $4.3 million is $400,000 less than the outstanding $4.7 million loan. The lender, seeing this declining value, insists that the bondholder put up an additional $400,000 in cash to guarantee the repayment of the loan.
Thus bondholders have been forced to sell, even if they do not want to, to raise the cash to satisfy their lenders. Their sales, often in panic, have further lowered the value of bonds. And as interest rates kept rising, more and more bondholders found themselves forced to sell to meet the demands of their lenders.
"People knew that someday the Federal Reserve would have to force up interest rates to deal with stronger economic growth and fight inflation," said Mr. Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston. "But they somehow believed it would be later rather than sooner and they still had time, although the danger signals began last fall."
 
 
First Rise Since '89
 The anemic economic growth finally gave way to a booming fourth quarter and a fairly robust first quarter, which ended yesterday. The Federal Reserve, seeing all of this renewed activity, worried that it might give rise to higher inflation in the future, although inflation is now mild. So, on Feb. 4, the Federal Reserve signaled that it would fight future inflation by raising short-term interest rates for the first time since 1989.
The Fed's expectation was that even though short-term rates rose, the 30-year bond rate, a benchmark for mortgages and car loans, would fall. Long-term bondholders would be satisfied that they did not need to push up interest rates to offset the costs of rising inflation. The Fed, after all, had acted with sufficient determination. And for a day, bond rates did fall. Then everything fell apart.
"What the Fed may have missed was the degree of leveraged speculation, and so they triggered a margin-call type of phenomenon," said Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation, a big operator of mutual funds.
Rising interest rates set off more than requests from lenders to repay, or call, margin loans. The higher rates made stocks less appealing, by holding out hope that certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing securities would now pay more than the 2.5 to 3 percent that many have offered in recent years. Huge sums that had been flowing into the stock market, largely through mutual funds, diminished or disappeared over the last two weeks, partly because of the new lure of an alternative investment, and partly because the selloff in the bond market made everyone nervous.
 
 
Experts' 180-Degree Turn
 The disappearance of this purchase money helped to make the Dow Jones industrial average plunge by 63.33 points on Tuesday and 72.27 on Wednesday, before finally showing a slight gain of 9.21 points yesterday. "You also have the spectacle of a whole bunch of Wall Street experts who had advised people to buy stocks, now telling them not to do so," Mr. Hoey said.
In addition, margin calls in the stock market contributed to the selloff. These loans to purchase stock are tracked by the stock exchanges; they had risen to $66 billion in February from $44 billion a year earlier.
The borrowing to purchase bonds, although not measured, has been many times greater. By themselves, so-called "hedge funds" may have piled up more than $300 billion in credit; these operations raise billions of dollars from wealthy individuals and then risk the money on instruments like bonds, here and abroad, and on currency speculation -- risky investments that resulted in big profits last year, but often losses this year.
The Quantum Fund is the largest and best-known hedge fund; it is owned by George Soros and manages $10 billion raised from individual investors. And for every dollar of money from these investors, the hedge funds and other large investors often borrow an additional $5 to invest.
Aside from the United States market, big chunks of this mostly American money have gone into European and Japanese bonds. But soon after the Federal Reserve acted on Feb. 4, trouble erupted for holders of German bonds, and that trouble increased the selling of American bonds.
 
 
German Disappointment
 Because Germany is suffering through a recession, bond prices had risen in the expectation that the Bundesbank, the German central bank, would lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. It did, but by much less than the speculators expected. "There was disappointment among ourselves, and in the hedge funds and in the banks and the security companies," Mr. Sargen of Prudential said.
More than disappointment, German bond prices fell, as steeply as they have in the United States, and bondholders have sold, often to meet margin calls. The selling in Germany reinforced sales of Treasury bonds in the United States as the sellers sought to raise cash to cover debt, here or abroad.
"Is there a common thread through all these markets?" said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "You might argue that the common thread is the leveraged investors who invest their capital around the world, and often sell simultaneously in all the markets."
Whatever the global reach, long-term interest rates have risen by more than a percentage point in the United States since early February, driving up the cost of mortgages, car loans and other borrowing beyond the level apparently intended by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation. "Bond yields have become unhinged from the economy," Mr. Giordano said, "and when that happens, rates can get high enough to guarantee that the economy slows down."

HEADLINE: New York Denies Blue Cross A Raise in High-Risk Rates

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
Ending a long pattern of granting rate increases for Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, state regulators yesterday turned down the company's request to raise health insurance premiums for nearly a million New Yorkers.
The proposed 8.8 percent rate increase would have affected those who have the most trouble getting health insurance: small businesses and individuals who must buy insurance on their own, groups that include many of the oldest and sickest New Yorkers. 
 The decision by Salvatore R. Curiale, the New York State Insurance Superintendent, is a watershed in the state's relationship with its largest health insurer, a company whose solvency is vital to New York's health care system. A spokesman for the Insurance Department said he knew of no other instance in Empire's 60-year history when a request for an overall rate increase was denied.
G. Robert O'Brien, Empire's chief executive, said he was "disappointed with the decision to reject what I considered to be a minimal rate increase." He said the company's reserves, already far below the amount considered safe by insurance regulators, will be further eroded.
The refusal follows the most tumultuous year in Empire's history, and a particularly trying time for Mr. Curiale, an appointee of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Last summer, the staff of a United States Senate subcommittee criticized Empire for poor management and said Mr. Curiale had functioned as a virtual cheerleader for the company. And Empire conceded last summer that it had kept two sets of financial records, an accurate one for internal use and an inaccurate one that was sent to state regulators.
Mr. Curiale's decision underscores a remarkable reversal of fortune for Empire. Just over one year ago, the Insurance Department granted Empire a 25 percent rate increase, the largest in its history, for the individual and small-group policies that cover some of the people who are considered the worst insurance risks. He cited what had appeared to be the imminent financial collapse of the company.
"I think that a rate increase is inappropriate because those policies produced a gain for Empire in 1993," Mr. Curiale said yesterday. He added that Empire still had money available from a $100 million bailout approved last year by the Legislature. "In my view, that money was never used," Mr. Curiale said.
The decision means that in the New York City area, the price for Empire's most popular individual policy will remain $232 per month for a single person and $497 per month for a family.
Mr. Curiale attributed Empire's improved financial condition to a significant slowing in medical inflation costs combined with the bailout money -- a refund of payments Empire made to a state malpractice fund.
Empire's reserves, which fell to about $40 million at the end of 1992, had risen to $231 million by the end of 1993, but the figure remains far below the $583 million required by state law.
"Nobody wants to see their surplus erode," Mr. Curiale said, adding that he hoped the company would find a way to make its large accounts more profitable.
Empire has about seven million customers, most of whom are insured through the medium and large group policies bought by the companies for which they work. Empire is free to charge whatever it likes for those policies, which are supposed to produce a surplus to help defray the cost of insurance for the 916,000 people with individual and small-group policies who are considered a worse risk and whose rates are set by the state.
 
Profit From High-Risk Group
 However, last year for the first time the high-risk group produced a profit of $97 million, while those insured through big companies and labor unions produced a loss of $95 million.
Mr. O'Brien, Empire's chief executive, said yesterday that the company was attempting to determine what options it has. The company could file a new application for a rate increase, but the process takes at least three months and there is little likelihood that Mr. Curiale will change his mind any time soon.
Mr. O'Brien, who took over at Empire last fall, said the company expects to have lower operating expenses in 1994 as a result of streamlining and staff reductions that began late last year.
But if the company is to survive, he said, some fundamental changes may have to occur in the health insurance industry. One option, he said, would be to require that all companies that sell health insurance in New York contribute toward a fund that would provide insurance for all who need it.
 
Special Status
 At present only Empire, a nonprofit corporation, is required by law to offer individual policies. Most for-profit companies offer policies only to medium and large labor unions and businesses, which are considered better insurance risks.
If such changes were made, Empire might give up its nonprofit status and special place in New York's health industry, Mr. O'Brien said. Empire might then become an insurance company operating under the same rules as any other in New York, he said. "And if they want Empire to service the high-risk pool, we certainly would," he said.
Over the last year, Empire has lost more than one million customers, partly because of complaints about service by some of the large companies and partly because of the inability of individuals and small groups to pay the higher costs.
In a new plan drawn up for the state, Empire predicted that it would have to double its rates over six years to stay solvent. Such rate increases would drive away hundreds of thousands of customers, many of whom would be forced to go without any medical insurance at all, insurance advocacy groups say.
The Cuomo administration has proposed a plan that would require all health insurers in the state to contribute money to pay for insurance premiums for certain high-risk New Yorkers, but its chances of approval by the Legislature are uncertain.

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Reach Accord at U.N. on Korean Nuclear Issue

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 31

 BODY:
The United States and China agreed on a Security Council statement tonight that calls on North Korea to allow inspectors to complete an investigation into whether North Korea is secretly building nuclear weapons. The statement obliquely warns the Government in Pyongyang that it faces a trade embargo if it does not cooperate.
The statement represents a compromise between the United States, which had favored sending this message in a weightier Security Council resolution, and China, which wanted a milder statement. 
 After the United States and China reached their compromise, the Council approved the statement.
Senior United States officials said tonight that they had no assurance from either China or North Korea that North Korea would agree to the completion of the nuclear inspection.
Nor is there any certainty that China will agree to any punitive action against North Korea if the Pyongyang Government still refuses to comply with today's statement.
But the officials argued that the Clinton Administration's strategy for dealing with North Korea's suspected breach of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is back on track.
If North Korea agrees to let the inspectors complete the work they started earlier this month, and exchanges envoys with South Korea, Washington will hold a third round of high-level talks with North Korea.
But after the vote, the North Korean representative at the United Nations, Pak Gil Yon, said that the statement "won't help solve the nuclear problems" and that North Korea had "nothing more to show" to the inspectors. The only way to resolve the problem, he added, was through negotiations between North Korea and the United States.
At those talks, the United States hopes to persuade North Korea to open two secret sites where it may have been working on nuclear weapons by offering the North new economic ties and eventually diplomatic recognition, which would end North Korea's nearly total diplomatic isolation.
The third round of talks was to have started in Geneva March 21. But the United States canceled the meeting when North Korea prevented the completion of the inspection, a survey that North Korea had originally agreed to.
This forced the inspection team to send the whole dispute to the Security Council, saying it could no longer guarantee that North Korea is not manufacturing plutonium.
Such processing would violate North Korea's obligation not to develop nuclear arms under terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Pyongyang has signed.
Tonight's statement calls upon North Korea to let the inspectors finish their work "as a step in fulfilling its obligations" under the agreement it reached in February with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and thus "honoring nonproliferation obligations of the Treaty."
The statement also implicitly set a six-week deadline for compliance by asking the atomic energy agency to report whether North Korea agrees to the follow-up inspections. Such a follow-up is required within six weeks of the completion of the inspection that was interrupted.
The statement asks China, which is North Korea's only ally, to maintain its "dialogue" with the Government in Pyongyang, meaning that it should continue to encourage North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions in the military field.
Finally, and most crucially, the statement warns North Korea that "further Security Council consideration will take place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of the I.A.E.A.-North Korean safeguards agreement."
United States officials said this was an implicit threat to impose a trade embargo on the North unless it agrees both to allow the completion of the inspection and to open the two secret sites to inspection.

HEADLINE: Haitians on Both Sides Assailing U.S.

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 31

 BODY:
After months of broken commitments, diplomatic reverses and an intense wave of political repression and deepening economic misery, influential Haitians on both sides of the stark political divide have begun to condemn United States policy on Haiti, calling it everything from confused and uninspired to cynical and half-hearted.
Increasingly, Haitians who seek the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, say they no longer have any faith in an American diplomacy they describe as a woeful series of zigzags, while Father Aristide's opponents now say openly that they have nothing to fear from Washington after a long string of unfulfilled threats. 
 Haitian political analysts say Washington's sinking credibility here is best seen in the reaction this week of the two main protagonists to the latest American attempt to restart diplomatic talks.
The new proposal calls for Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras to resign his army command at the same time that Father Aristide, who lives in Washington, names a new prime minister. Simultaneously, the Haitian legislature would pass an amnesty law shielding officers involved in the September 1991 coup against Father Aristide.
 
Presented by Gore
 Scarcely had the plan been presented to Father Aristide by Vice President Al Gore than the Haitian's closest advisers began to reject it as unworkable, insisting that Washington obtain General Cedras's resignation before Father Aristide is asked to do anything further.
For his part, General Cedras -- meeting here on Monday with the United States Ambassador, William L. Swing, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut -- expressed what participants called a total lack of interest in any process aimed at returning Father Aristide.
Beyond General Cedras's lack of response, Haitian legislators distancing themselves from Washington say the army leader had warned some deputies that he would "wash my bayonet in your blood" if they ever sought to make any decisions about his future.
"People are laughing at the Americans because they have been so inconsistent," said Georges Leger, a former Haitian Ambassador to Washington and a strong critic of Father Aristide. "Nobody believes in any of this anymore. If Mr. Clinton had sent in a few marines earlier on, that would have been the end of it, but they have never wanted to grab the bull by the horns and tell Cedras enough is enough."
While Mr. Leger has long castigated American diplomacy, open disaffection toward Washington has recently spread among politicians who have been sympathetic both toward the United States and toward the return of Father Aristide. Disenchantment has also begun to spread in the United States Embassy itself, where some diplomats say morale is at an all-time low.
 
Embarrassments for U.S.
 For many, the mounting sense of disgust dates back to the withdrawal of a United States troopship in October because of a dockside demonstration by a rag-tag assembly of Haitian Army sympathizers. The ship was carrying more than 200 American and Canadian officers, whose training mission here was widely seen as crucial to securing the return of Father Aristide at the end of the October, as scheduled.
The embarrassment of the ship's retreat was repeated in late November, when senior officers from the United States, Canada, France and Venezuela visited Haiti to issue an ultimatum to General Cedras, saying that if he did not step down by Jan. 15, severe new sanctions would be added to an arms and oil embargo.
That deadline came and went, and no new sanctions were imposed. Instead, the United States has been involved in often open wrangling with Father Aristide in what many here see as an ill-advised attempt to wrest new political concessions from him. This occurred despite the fact that Father Aristide has fulfilled his obligations under the agreement with General Cedras that they signed in July in New York.
The newest American plan hopes to achieve several goals simultaneously, before Haiti's fractious politicians can unravel any progress. Critics here say, however, that there is no suggestion that the army will go along with any plan.
Father Aristide, smarting at being asked to make new moves after he respected past agreements, has raised objections ranging from the unclear fate of the powerful police commander, Lieut. Joseph Michel Francois, to the lack of an explicit date for his return.
 
Lack of Confidence in U.S.
 Basically, however, the Haitian leader seems almost totally to lack confidence in American promises.
"There have been nothing but mixed signals and ambiguities, and most importantly, they have not kept their word," said Lionel Delatour, an American-educated businessman who helped arrange a visit by Haitian legislators to Washington this year in an attempt to restart talks to resolve the political crisis.
"Two generals and two admirals from major powers came here and issued an ultimatum, and over 60 days have passed with nothing being done," Mr. Delatour said. "There is no more credibility, and the Americans, who have been driving the policy, have the largest part of the blame."
Although diplomats are not free to express their views openly, many in the United States Embassy now share a sense of failure. "People come out of the country meetings and say, what kind of nonsense is this?" an American official said.
Responding to reports of the growing disenchantment in the embassy,another official said, "This is not an easy place to serve, even in the best of times, but at least when things are going your way and policy is working, you can take the hardships that come with the job."

HEADLINE: Police Station Becomes a Cash Station

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 31

 BODY:
Inside the Seventh District police station, just down the hall from the handcuffed gang member and the battered wife with nowhere else to hide, Shawna Jackson came to do her banking.
A few months ago, in an experiment to bring more financial services to the poor and to cut down on the muggings that make the South Side police district one of Chicago's toughest, the city and a local bank installed an automatic teller machine in the lobby of the police station. 
 But as it spits out $10 and $20 bills over the crackle of police radios, the money machine is much more than a routine convenience. It is a symbol of hope in a struggling neighborhood and a sign of how desperate and dangerous modern times have become.
Muggers are robbing people at money machines with increasing frequency, prompting banks and some cities to take unusual protective measures. In 10 Western states, Bank of America has moved some ATM's inside 24-hour supermarkets and shopping malls. In Oakland, Calif., five busy Wells Fargo Bank branches have red emergency buttons that link ATM-users to the police. And in Los Angeles, the City Council has approved the installation of 30 new ATM's in police station lobbies.
 
'You Got to Be on Your Guard'
 But even though she was surrounded by armed officers inside the Seventh District police station here in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood, Ms. Jackson clutched her purse as she scanned the lobby for potential attackers. "No matter where you are nowadays," she said, "you got to be on your guard every minute."
A message on top of the machine tries to reassure people like Ms. Jackson that there is at least one safe place left. "Now you can feel secure withdrawing cash from an automatic teller machine knowing it's police-protected 24 hours a day, 7 days a week," the sign says.
But Ms. Jackson, a public school clerk, knows from bitter experience that beyond the glass doors of the police station, even simple tasks like withdrawing a few dollars to pay the baby sitter can get a person killed. She was mugged at an ATM a few miles from the station several months ago. The mugger took $100 and what was left of her sense of freedom to conduct business like an ordinary citizen.
These days, even if some people are brave enough or foolish enough to use an ATM in the Seventh District, they might have a hard time finding one. Only a few machines are left in Englewood. But then, few residents of the neighborhood have needed an ATM. Nearly half the people in Englewood live below the Federal poverty level, and the unemployment rate is 33 percent. Dealing with a bank teller -- human or computer -- will take some getting used to.
Otis Monroe 3d, president of a not-for-profit neighborhood training program, the Monroe Foundation, said his group came up with the idea of putting the ATM in the police station to help stop the neighborhood's physical and spiritual mugging.
"We need to begin to see other images around here other than poverty and crime," Mr. Monroe said. "We need to see investments. We need to feel as bankable as any other part of the city."
Last year the foundation persuaded the Marquette National Bank to place an automatic teller in the police station on a six-month trial basis. The machine was installed around Christmas. So far it has handled about 450 transactions a month, well below the bank's target of 1,000. Part of the problem is that not many people know that the station has an ATM.
A few weeks ago, a green and white Cash Station banner was put up on the wall outside, not far from the Stars and Stripes snapping in the cold spring wind. And Comdr. Ronnie Watson, the district commander who is a member of the foundation's board,hopes to replace the banner soon with an electronic sign that lights up at dusk.
 
Cluttered With Crime Debris
 "This is what community policing is all about," he said, sitting behind his desk, which was cluttered with the debris of a long, murderous weekend throughout Chicago. In the Seventh District alone, five people were shot to death in what the police fear is the start of yet another of the gang wars that have soaked Englewood in blood.
Despite the bloodshed, robberies and killings are down compared with this time last year, the police said.
"Every year we recover more guns than the year before," Commander Watson said. Many of the guns are used in holdups near the neighborhood's many currency exchanges, a staple of the inner city where neighborhood residents, especially welfare recipients, cash their checks for a fee.
Everyone in the neighborhood knows when the checks are due, including the robbers, many of whom were on welfare themselves before the state eliminated welfare for single adults, Commander Watson said.
The other day, as the morning shift went home and the officers on the afternoon shift checked their weapons and bulletproof vests, Keion Hightower slid his bank card through a slot in the automatic teller and punched in his identification number. But having an ATM in the station lobby, he said, does not make him feel much safer.
"It's not going to really cut down on all these robberies," he said. "Look at all the crime in this neighborhood right near the police station. What we need around here is some more jobs. Then you wouldn't need to put a cash machine in the police station."

HEADLINE: U.S. Youth In Singapore Loses Appeal On Flogging

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, March 31

 BODY:
In a move that threatens to disrupt relations, the Chief Justice of Singapore rejected appeals from President Clinton today and ordered that an American teen-ager be flogged for spray-painting cars and other mischief in this prosperous, order-loving city-state.
The case of Michael Fay, 18, of Dayton, Ohio, raises the prospect of a rift between the United States and one of its closest allies and trading partners in Southeast Asia, and American diplomats immediately protested the decision by the Chief Justice, Yong Pung How, to uphold the flogging sentence. 
 Mr. Fay has confessed to spray-painting cars and throwing eggs at other vehicles. He was sentenced to four months in prison and six lashes with a half-inch-thick rattan cane, a punishment that results in permanent scars and usually sends prisoners into shock.
President Clinton intervened in the case in early March, describing the caning sentence as "extreme" and asking Singapore to reconsider.
 
'An Excessive Penalty'
 "We continue to believe caning is an excessive penalty for a youthful nonviolent offender who pleaded guilty to repairable crimes against private property," said Ralph L. Boyce, the charge d'affaires at the United States Embassy in Singapore, who attended the appeals court hearing. "We continue to hope that the Government of Singapore will reconsider the sentence."
Mr. Fay, who arrived here two years ago to live with his mother and stepfather, has now exhausted his court appeals. His final hope for avoiding the flogging rests with Singapore's President, Ong Teng Cheong, who has clemency powers. Lawyers for the teen-ager were reported to be planning an appeal to President Ong.
Mr. Fay, who had been hospitalized for depression in the week since his sentencing, was stoical during the court hearing. The teen-ager's fear was obvious only when his feet pushed through the slats of the wooden dock. They shook frantically.
He had been free on bail, but after the Chief Justice's ruling today he was taken into custody in preparation for his caning. No date has been announced for the punishment.
His case has attracted publicity in the United States -- not all of it to Mr. Fay's advantage, since some public opinion polls taken in the United States after his sentencing here suggested that a majority of Americans would support corporal punishment in such a case.
Few Americans are likely to understand exactly what a caning in Singapore entails. While spokesmen for the Singapore Government have been unwilling recently to describe the punishment in detail, diplomats say that prisoners are tied down to a wooden trestle and are then whipped with a rattan cane moistened to prevent it from fraying. Diplomats say the initial blows tear open the skin and, within seconds, prisoners usually go into shock from the intense pain.
 
Senator Supports Youth
 Mr. Fay has received support from several members of the United States Congress, including Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, who was in Singapore today as part of a tour for the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Senator Cohen said that the case of Mr. Fay was "getting out of hand" and could disrupt the otherwise "great relationship between the United States and Singapore."
In another court case closely watched by international human rights organizations, two journalists, two private financial analysts and a Government economist were convicted today of violating Singapore's strict Official Secrets Act.
The five were fined a total of $13,370 for having communicated and received Government economic data that turned up in an article in Business Times, the leading financial newspaper in Singapore. The July 1992 article disclosed an early, confidential Government estimate of quarterly economic growth.
All five were spared jail sentences,which surprised foreign diplomats and lawyers here.

HEADLINE: Man of the Law, and of Letters as Well

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH COHEN 

 BODY:
More than a century ago Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. told a group of Harvard undergraduates: "The law is not the place for the artist or the poet. . . . The law is the calling of thinkers."
Whatever merit history may have bestowed on the second part of that assessment, it has offered a fair share of exceptions to the first. Archibald MacLeish, a Harvard Law School graduate, wrote four books of poems. And a San Francisco lawyer named Charles Reznikoff wrote an entire book of them, "Testimony," that was based on actual court records. Then there was Wallace Stevens, who was a surety bond lawyer. And Edgar Lee Masters, author of "The Spoon River Anthology," was a law partner of Clarence Darrow. 
 Indeed, it may have been Darrow himself rather than Holmes who had it right when he said, "Inside every lawyer is the wreck of a poet."
In any event, now comes Lawrence Joseph, a professor at St. John's University School of Law in New York, who, with greater effect than any of his contemporaries, is carrying on the tradition. Mr. Joseph, a winner of the coveted Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize, is the author of three volumes, most recently "Before Our Eyes," published a few months ago by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
Balancing caesuras and cases might seem unwieldly, but Mr. Joseph is managing fine. In fact, he says, his two careers are symbiotic: ideas from law often feed his poetic imagination, while "poetry informs the law by making me more sensitive to language, different levels of meaning, different perspectives and an attention to the ways things work."
For the last seven years, Mr. Joseph has taught jurisprudence, torts, the legal process and employment law at St. John's, where, he says, his goal is to "help meld creative, socially conscious, ethical and knowledgeable lawyers."
For even longer -- ever since he read Stevens's "The Emperor of Ice Cream" as an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Michigan -- he has been writing poetry. His themes range from factory work (as in "Factory Rat") to racism ("Sand Nigger") and, of course, the law ("Witness," "Material Facts").
"As a lawyer, I have to be conversant in the languages of social power, economics, history, violence, work and race, and I try to transform them into my poetry," said the 45-year-old Mr. Joseph, whose furrowed brow and slightly stooped posture suggest long nights filled with hard thought, no matter what the topic.
 
Lines of Logic
 His editor, Jonathan Galassi, who is editor in chief of Farrar, Straus & Giroux and himself a poet, finds Mr. Joseph's double career a source of richness. "His poems show a lot of logical concentration," Mr. Galassi said, "which certainly relates to his thinking as a legal scholar. I've edited a few other lawyer-writers, such as Louis Auchincloss and Scott Turow, and they're all highly organized thinkers."
After graduating from the University of Michigan Law School but before arriving at St. John's, Mr. Joseph clerked for Justice G. Mennen Williams of the Michigan Supreme Court and then litigated cases at the New York firm of Shearman & Sterling. He describes himself as an incessant note taker, a filer, a chronic clipper of articles. He is always collecting ideas and fragments of sentences, many of which are eventually woven into his poems.
With titles like "Material Facts," some of those poems clearly mine his legal career for their imagery. Others reflect his interest in subjects like race, ethnicity, his hometown (Detroit) and art and color theory, which he has learned about from his wife, Nancy Van Goethem, a painter.
In "Do What You Can," a poem in his first collection, "Shouting at No One," an old man prays to a statue of the Virgin Mary, factories turn out automobiles and a woman pockets a half-smoked cigarette. Then, in the final stanzas, Mr. Joseph leans again toward the legal world he understands so well:
I press the accelerator to keep the motor warm.
I wonder if they know
that after the jury is instructed
on the Burden of Persuasion and the Burden of Truth,
that after the sentence of 20 to 30 years comes down,
when the accused begs, "Lord, I can't do that kind of time,"
the judge, looking down, will smile and say,
"Then do what you can."

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING: NOTEBOOK;
A Winter of Red Ink Cancels Simulcasting

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO 

 BODY:
They pulled the plug yesterday on the great simulcasting experiment, which was supposed to rescue New York from the ravages of racing in wintertime. And after 70 days of betting on mixed programs of live races at Aqueduct plus televised races from Florida, the general reaction seemed to be: Who needs winter racing, anyway?
The weather didn't help. During the three months the experiment was allowed by the Legislature, 15 racing dates were wiped out by snow and ice, attendance plunged from 8,250 a day last year to 6,339 this year (down 23 percent) and betting dropped from $2.1 million a day to $1.8 million (down by nearly 16 percent). 
 "It didn't work the way people expected," said Gerard J. McKeon, president of the New York Racing Association. "The bettors just weren't as interested in simulcast races as they were in home races. You root for the home team in racing, in baseball, in anything. And New Yorkers are notoriously chauvinistic in rooting. Also, there were too many races, and people wanted more time between races to do their handicapping."
 
Asking for Help
 How about next winter?
"We're tapped out," McKeon said. "We simply don't have the resources to run next winter. The Legislature will have to change the laws to enable us to run and to survive financially.
"We're required to run a total of 196 days a year. We've been running longer than that to accommodate the Governor and the horsemen. We could cut that down unilaterally, but we'd rather not. We'd much rather do it with everybody's agreement. But I think the economics of the situation will force our hand. We still think racing should be suspended at least six weeks in the winter."
 
 
Side Road to Derby
 The Jim Beam Stakes, the race that launched the careers of Hansel in 1991 and Prairie Bayou in 1993, will be run tomorrow at Turfway Park in Kentucky. Whose Triple Crown career will it launch this time?
Eleven colts were entered yesterday, drawn by the twin prospects of going home with $360,000 from the purse of $600,000 plus instant stature on the road to the Kentucky Derby. The Turfway Park early line makes Southern Rhythm the favorite at 3-1, breaking from the No. 3 gate, with Polar Expedition next at 7-2 odds, breaking from the rail.
The heavy hitters on both East and West Coasts will generally be absent because they are resting or training for their next milestones back home: the Santa Anita Derby next Saturday, April 9, and both the Blue Grass Stakes and the Wood Memorial the following Saturday, April 16. But the Jim Beam has grown in importance since it was first run 13 years ago, and it is certain to enhance the standing of one or two of the candidates aiming for Churchill Downs on May 7.
 
A Launching Pad
 Recent winners of the Jim Beam have done heroic things: In 1990, Summer Squall went on to run second in the Derby and first in the Preakness. In 1991, Hansel set a track record in the Beam (1:463/5 for the mile and an eighth), then won the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes and the 3-year-old championship. In 1992, Lil E. Tee went on to win the Derby. And in 1993, Prairie Bayou won the Beam and then ran second in the Derby and first in the Preakness.
Southern Rhythm, a son of the speedcat Dixieland Band, ran second in his debut at Keeneland last October and has won three straight this year at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas. He joined the candidates on the road to Kentucky three weeks ago when he won the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn over Dish It Out and Polar Expedition.
"He couldn't be any better," his trainer, James Keefer, reported the other day after watching his star work out at Churchill Downs. "He was out there kicking and squealing and looking for something to run at."
 
 
Sign of Spring
 The big horses are back in town. And here come some big ones tomorrow for the Westchester Handicap at Aqueduct: Colonial Affair, winner of the Belmont Stakes last year; Cherokee Run, second in the Preakness and first in the Dwyer, and Virginia Rapids, who won the Peter Pan last year. They'll go one mile for $100,000.

HEADLINE: Inside Art

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
Is Architecture Art?
Should architecture be considered art? In Culver City, Calif., the answer from the City Council is yes, depending on the situation. 
 This month, Culver City revised its 1-percent-for-art program, which had stipulated, as do many such programs across the country, that 1 percent of the construction cost of a building must be used for artworks. Some opponents say such laws encourage second-rate art in front of buildings that would look better without it. The Culver City law also prohibited architects from creating their own artworks to comply with the 1-percent quota.
The city has amended its policy so that the architecture itself can be considered art in some cases, and if approved by the City Council, the project would be exempt from the 1-percent law.
Culver City, which is just southwest of downtown Los Angeles, is the first place in the nation to make such a modification. Local officials say other cities may follow. "I hope they do," said Mark Winogrond, the director of community development for Culver City. "It's a fair balancing of two competing forces: on one hand, there's architecture that's art, but on the other hand, the ability to abuse the rulings by developers claiming their buildings are art is rampant. That's why each case has to be decided on individually."
The idea to change the law came from Frederick Smith, a developer who is rebuilding 50 acres of an abandoned industrial area in Culver City. While Mr. Smith conceded that developers may try to save money by saying that their buildings should be considered art, he also said that the 1 percent was a "relatively insignificant" amount.
"All I want," he added, "is for architecture to be accepted as art."
A project by the Los Angeles architect Eric Owen Moss for Mr. Smith was submitted to the Council because the developer said its sculptural nature met the art requirement.
"Eric's work became the guinea pig," said Frances Anderton, an architectural journalist who teamed up with Mr. Smith to draft a proposal to the Council. "I do believe in the 1-percent-for-art program, in principle. But I don't know if in the end it has always produced good results. I'm aware that the ramifications in changing the policy are immense."
Their proposal included endorsements from Miguel Angel Corzo, the director of the Getty Conservation Institute in Marina del Rey; Richard Koshalek, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and Philip Johnson, the architect.
Peter Rowe, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Architecture, also agreed. "That the architectural landscape doesn't count as art is a limited position and dangerous to perpetrate in public communities," Mr. Rowe said. "It undermines artistic integrity."
Mr. Moss, the architect in the Culver City project, said that he hoped "this will not bring artists out to fight architects" but that the change was "terribly important."
Others disagree. "It's a troubling trend," said Tom Otterness, a New York-based sculptor who has created major art projects on both coasts. "Public art seems to be one of the only ways for art to reach the public. This is a way of society isolating itself from art."
Max Protetch, a SoHo dealer who represents many artists working on public projects, said that he believed that "architecture isn't art" and that he had "never confused the two." "This is another excuse not to involve art in society," he added.
At the Department of Cultural Affairs in New York City, Tom Finkelpearl, the director of its percent-for-art program, says he is thankful that what has happened in Culver City hasn't "begun to ripple through the percent-for-art-world yet."
"Art and architecture are different professions," Mr. Finkelpearl said. "Both should be able to contribute. It's important to have more than one voice."
 
J. Carter Brown
 J. Carter Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, has become the exhibition director of "Rings: Five Passions in the Art World," the first global art exhibition to be planned in conjunction with the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. The show will be at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta from July 4, 1996, through Sept. 24, 1996. It is the first show Mr. Brown, who is 60, has worked on since retiring a year and a half ago.
The show, whose cost is estimated at $3 million, is being organized by Mr. Brown in collaboration with the High Museum and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. It will be the centerpiece of the Olympic Arts Festival.
"The interlocking rings that symbolize the Olympic Games also represent the coming together of many people, nations and emotions," Mr. Brown said. "The show will deal with treasures that represent the five passions: love, anguish, awe, triumph and joy. Because we only have so much space, we have limited the focus to paintings and sculpture."
The show is expected to include about 100 objects and occupy 2 floors of the museum. Mr. Brown says the objects will come from museums and private collections and will be a mix of "major masterpieces and many surprises."
 
Divorce Plus Debt
 Death, divorce and debt keep the auction business going. And a double whammy is benefiting Christie's, which has announced it is selling the collection of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art belonging to the financier Meshulam Riklis, who is the owner of the McCrory Corporation five-and-dime chain stores.
Mr. Riklis and his wife, the entertainer Pia Zadora, are divorcing. And McCrory filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two years ago. The artworks are to be sold in New York on May 3, 4 and 10.
"Mr. Riklis has a natural talent for spotting good things," said Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's in New York. Among the Impressionist and modern paintings to be auctioned on May 10 is Monet's "Red-Colored Boat," from 1890. While the catalogue reads "estimate on request," Christie's officials say they expect it to sell for about $7 million. Also being offered on May 10 is Leger's "Contrast of Forms" (1913), estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million. Among the contemporary artworks for sale on May 3 is Jackson Pollock's "No. 22" (1949), expected to fetch $2 million to $3 million.

Soft-Focus Portraits Yield to Hard Images Of Depression Poverty

BYLINE: By CHARLES HAGEN 

 BODY:
In 1930 Dorothea Lange was a genteel portrait photographer in San Francisco, producing slightly soft-focus, moodily lighted images in a style recalling that of her teachers, the well-known pictorialists Arnold Genthe and Clarence White. Over the next five years, though, Lange traveled a remarkable distance in her work, turning from polite portraits to the searing, unforgettable images of migrant workers and rural poverty that cemented her fame.
This shift is the unstated subject of the fascinating if somewhat jumbled show of Lange's photographs now at the Houk-Friedman Gallery. This show includes some of Lange's most famous images, including "Migrant Mother," the classic 1936 photograph of a woman, her face lined with worry, whose children press themselves to her body. 
Also included are photographs from the 1950's, including two from a project on trials, taken in an Oakland courtroom. But nearly half of the 41 pictures here were made in the three years before 1935, when Lange was invited to join other photographers in documenting the work of the Resettlement Administration, the New Deal farm agency better known by its later name, the Farm Security Administration.
Not surprisingly, the catalyst for Lange's transformation from portraitist to documentarian was the Depression. In 1932, with poor and unemployed people crowding San Francisco, she took her camera into the streets. One of the first images she made working in this new way, "White Angel Bread Line," has become an icon of the period. In it, a man turns away from a crowd lining up for food, his stained, shapeless hat pulled down around his ears and his mouth set in a grim line.
Several photographs here were taken during political demonstrations or labor disputes, including San Francisco's General Strike of 1934. In another famous picture, a policeman in a dark uniform towers over a cluster of sign-carrying demonstrators behind him.
One of the most remarkable aspects of these early political pictures, though, is how little attention Lange pays to their subjects as individuals. People are reduced to social types, with their faces often hidden in heavy shadows. As a result, the photographs sometimes take on the predictability and emotional flatness of political cartoons. Even when a person's face is visible, its features may be twisted into a snarling caricature, as is the case in the close-up of a speaker at a May Day rally.
However distanced they may be emotionally, Lange's pictures from this period demonstrate her masterly use of eloquent gestures and telling details as clues to a person's situation and character. One particularly striking photograph focuses on a woman's crossed legs, with the patched and knotted stockings suggesting her attempts to maintain dignity in the face of difficulties.
Lange brought this awareness of the symbolic power of details to the pictures she made for the Farm Security Administration. In these later pictures, though, she seemed to relax and to get closer to her subjects, both physically and emotionally.
Many of Lange's pictures after 1935 have a remarkable openness. Perhaps because of her skill as a portraitist, she was able to get her subjects to offer themselves to the camera seemingly without reservation, whatever their social situation. In these pictures Lange balances her earlier tendency to treat her subjects as social types with a direct, personal connection to them. By combining the intimacy of personal contact with the analytical distance of sociology her photographs offer a particularly powerful blend of insight and emotion.
Lange's odyssey in these years was personal as well as professional. In 1935 she met Paul Taylor, an agricultural economist, and the two began to work together, gathering information and pictures exploring the plight of migrant farm workers. Both were already married; Lange had two children and Taylor three. But they fell in love and, after each had divorced, they were married at the end of 1935.
For the next five years Lange worked on and off for the farm agency until 1940 when she was let go in a budget cut. Despite legendary battles with Roy Stryker, the head of the agency, over the control of her negatives, she produced many of the project's most famous pictures, and she later photographed for the Sate Department and the Office of War Information.
Illness and family obligations limited Lange's photography after the early 1940's, although in the next decade she pursued projects for Life magazine and other publications. Many of her later pictures were made during extensive trips that she and Taylor took to Ireland, Indonesia and other countries; they often demonstrate the same ability to connect with her subjects that is apparent in her Depression-era images, but the sense of urgency has dissipated.
This tantalizing but frustrating show provides marvelous examples of Lange's work, particularly from the early 1930's. But pictures seem thrown together for no particular reason, with little attempt to shape them into a coherent story that conveys the drama of her life and her images.
A major retrospective of Lange's work is to open at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in May, traveling to the International Center of Photography in 1995. It may do a better job of recounting Lange's amazing flowering as a photographer.
Photographs by Dorothea Lange remain at the Houk-Friedman Gallery, 851 Madison Avenue, at 70th Street, through May 7.

HEADLINE: In Michigan School-Tax Shift, the Poor Lose

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As you indicate in "Fairer Schooling for Michigan" (editorial, March 18), the school reform measure in Michigan -- to finance public schools by sales and other taxes, rather than property taxes -- was successful because there was something in it for both conservatives and liberals, or so they believe. 
 For conservatives, the measure represents a shift in the tax code. As the preponderance of sociological and economic research has shown, property taxes fall disproportionately on the wealthy, while sales taxes fall disproportionately on the poor.
For liberals, the measure represents a shift in educational spending away from inequitable financing that favors the wealthier districts. Yet this supposed "benefit" for the poorer school districts flies in the face of nearly 30 years of sociological research that has found that levels of spending on education do not make a difference in the educational achievement of students.
Liberals, then, really got nothing for something: at the expense of a more regressive tax code, liberals won acceptance for changes in educational expenditures, which will make about as much of a difference in the lives of inner city students as cloud patterns in Moldavia.
For those, whether liberal or conservative, who are interested in improving the lives of inner city youths, a less regressive tax code, in combination with broad-based educational reform along the lines being attempted by New York City's Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, would be preferable to the pyrrhic victory in Michigan.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Reassurance

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, March 31

 BODY:
Seeking to reassure investors whose nervousness has sent the stock market plunging, President Clinton expressed confidence today that the economy remained strong.
Mr. Clinton urged investors not to "overreact" to the weeklong fall of share prices and said he hoped the market would "rebound quickly." He said there was no reason to believe that the drop in the market represented more than a periodic correction. 
 "What I'm trying to do is to reassure people because no one believes that there's a serious problem with an underlying economy," Mr. Clinton told reporters here this morning. "It is healthy, and it is sound."
He said he had spoken at length this morning with Robert Rubin, head of the National Economic Council. Mr. Clinton said an "exhaustive review" conducted by the Administration since the market began to fall had found evidence pointing only to continued economic growth.
"No one should make any decisions based on a worry about some inflation factor they don't know about or some impending problem in some sector of the economy," he said.

HEADLINE: The Muted U.S. Outcry Toward Japan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The Government released its list of countries erecting egregious trade barriers today, singling out Japan as the worst offender. But senior officials said they were not, for the moment, contemplating any new sanctions against Tokyo.
The Clinton Administration has decided to give the Japanese more time to flesh out their sketchy offer, made earlier this week, to break the trade deadlock. This restrained response by the Administration to a Japanese trade package deemed wholly insufficient is in striking contrast to some of the tough language of recent months. 
 It is a direction that comes straight from the White House, officials say, and reflects concern about destabilizing world markets as well as a need to enlist Japan's support to deal with North Korea and China.
 
Just Enough Good Faith
 In economic terms, President Clinton has decided that there was just enough in the Japanese offer for him to feel that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was making a good-faith effort to reform the Japanese system.
The vague Hosokawa package says that Japan would spend the next three months devising steps to eliminate red tape in 11 important areas where foreign companies believe they are systematically being frozen out of the Japanese market, but would not decide until June on specifically how to loosen government regulations or increase spending.
While the Hosokawa offer falls well short of what the United States wants, the White House believes that it is worth giving the Prime Minister a little time -- no one will say how long -- to see if he can come through with the substantive details it is demanding. If he fails, the Administration will opt for more sanctions.
In the meantime, though, American officials say that the marketplace is already exerting intense pressure on Tokyo, by driving up the value of the yen. They seem to feel that additional sanctions by the United States now would be superfluous, and, given the volatile condition of the American and other stock markets, too dangerous to impose at the moment. One of the factors that led to drops in many stock markets was concern about an American-Japanese trade war.
Since the Hosokawa offer was deemed "a work in progress" by the Clinton Administration, currency speculators have driven up the value of the yen, assuming that the United States would deliberately drive it up sometime later. When the value of the yen rises, it makes Japanese exports more expensive and results in Japanese businesses losing market share. It has the effect of a tariff imposed on everything Japan sells abroad, which is worse than any formal sanction the Clinton Administration could devise.
 
Letting the Yen Do It
 This, in turn, has caused a howl of complaints from Japanese businessmen that the Hosokawa Government is not doing enough to break the trade deadlock. As American officials see it, this is the best kind of pressure. It comes from Japan and is directed at the truly vulnerable points. They want to let it percolate more. The officials insist that they are doing nothing to manipulate the value of the yen, but they do not have to -- market is doing it for them. In Tokyo today, the dollar closed at 102.80 yen, down 0.50 yen from Wednesday's close.
Another important factor muting the American response to Japan is that the strategic environment between Washington and Tokyo has changed in the last few weeks.
Analysts point to two factors. Prime Minister Hosokawa's recent visit to China, when he went out of his way to distance himself from American human rights demands, was a subtle reminder to the United States that it should not drive Japan and China together by getting into trade conflicts with both at the same time.
There is a triangular strategic relationship in the Asia-Pacific region. But rather than the Soviet Union, China and the United States do-si-doing with each other, it is now Japan, China and the United States -- with each wanting to make sure that it is not left isolated by the two others.
Second, the collapse of negotiations with North Korea over inspections of its nuclear program has put the United States on a path where it is will soon have to make specific decisions about how to deal with the Pyongyang Government, whether by a trade embargo or some military measure. This is not the time when American officials want to be in a trade war with Tokyo, whose support will be critical in dealing with North Korea.
 
Kantor's Twin Gambits
 "The Japanese themselves said that they will be coming forward with more details," the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said of the Hosokawa package. "So the ball remains in their court, and under the circumstances, we intend to react in a careful and measured way."
Mr. Kantor, though, laid the legal groundwork today for any additional sanctions with the publication of the National Trade Estimate Report. This annual report to Congress detailed "onerous restrictions" to free trade imposed by Japan in markets ranging from cars to medical equipment. These have been the subject of the failed negotiations between the two countries for the last year.
According to the Super 301 trade provision revived by President Clinton a month ago, the Administration has until September 30 to identify any one of these Japanese barriers as a "priority foreign country practice," which should be eliminated. That, in turn, starts a clock ticking, under which Japan must respond by taking down the barriers or face punitive tariffs on some of its products coming into the United States.
Nearly 40 other countries were also criticized for their trade practices in today's report, with China severely chastised as failing to clamp down on the piracy of American videos, software and compact disks.

HEADLINE: Economist, And Now A Politician

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 31

 BODY:
Foreign investors got what they wanted when a classically trained economist was selected to replace the governing party's slain presidential candidate in Mexico, but now they are concerned that the candidate's great strengths in handling the economy may turn out to be a weakness in handling the country.
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon has a doctorate in economics from Yale and such extensive experience in Mexico's central bank and its budget ministry that if he is elected president on Aug. 21, as expected, he would become one of the most economically skilled heads of state in the world. 
 So why should financiers worry? Because Mr. Zedillo has never before run for office, and because he has a wooden style of speech and an aloof manner that will not help much in calming a nation distraught by three months of violence and demands for social justice. Many investors are now concerned more about political instability than about inflation.
The Mexican stock exchange, which reacted modestly to Mr. Zedillo's selection on Tuesday, was closed today for the long Easter weekend.
 
Politically Educable
 "What's not clear is the sort of political skills he might bring to the job," said Lawrence D. Krohn, chief Latin American economist at Lehman Brothers. "To what extent he might command the support of the majority of poor and lower-class Mexicans is another area of concern. He's reputed not to have the common touch, but then neither did Salinas. He's young enough, though. He could learn."
Mr. Zedillo, 42, is widely known as a free-market economist who cut his teeth within the polished walls of the Banco de Mexico, the nation's conservative central bank. He has been a key member of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's team, serving almost four years as Minister of Planning and Budget and two years as Education Secretary.
He is expected to continue most of Mr. Salinas's economic programs, having had a strong hand in carrying them out, and is known to support the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexican business was pleased with his selection. Luis German Carcoba Garcia, president of the Business Coordinating Council, said the choice of Mr. Zedillo was a clear signal that current economic programs would continue.
 
Yale, and the Baja
 The candidate is no stranger to the United States. Years before his time at Yale, he grew up on the poor streets of the border city of Mexicali on the Baja peninsula.
He attended Yale on a scholarship from the Mexican Government. A thesis adviser, Gustav Ranis, remembers Mr. Zedillo as "always a moderate in his view, not a rabid free-marketeer nor an interventionist -- a very mature person even at a young age."
"He is someone who believes in the role of government very much," Professor Ranis, an international economist, continued, "but he wants the government to work with the market, not obstruct it."
While at the Bank of Mexico in the years after the Mexican debt crisis of 1982, Mr. Zedillo oversaw a multibillion-dollar trust set up to help private businesses that could not pay their international debts because the peso had been devalued and dollars were hard to come by. The trust made sure that dollars were available, and also protected the businesses from further peso fluctuation.
"It was an amazingly successful program that has not received much public attention," said Gabriel Szekely, a Mexico City consultant. "But for the business community it was very relevant, which explains why Zedillo has so much clout with business."
 
Experience Under Salinas
 In 1988, Mr. Zedillo joined Mr. Salinas's Cabinet. He took control of the Office of Budget and Planning, the same office once held by Mr. Salinas and by the President before him, Miguel de la Madrid. Mr. Zedillo played a key role in drawing up a national development plan and the programs that have helped lower Mexico's inflation rate to single digits.
As Education Secretary, he dismantled the federal education system and gave responsibility to the 31 states. In doing so, the power of the national teachers' union was broken.
The slain candidate whom Mr. Zedillo replaced, Luis Donaldo Colosio, had also been seen as representing continuity. However, after impoverished Maya Indians in Chiapas state took up arms, Mr. Colosio moved slightly from a technocratic approach of the Salinas reforms toward the view that Mexico had too many millionaires and too many poor people to continue without a clash.
Raul Munoz Leos, president of Du Pont of Mexico, looked to the future. "We should not kid anybody into thinking that he isn't in for a tough time," he said of Mr. Zedillo. "Like Salinas, he will need an excellent team. If he can put it together it will not be a cake walk, but I feel confident that he will be able to do it."

Companies Cut Back New Issues

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Frightened by the prospect of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty, American corporations' appetite for cash from the public markets decreased in the first three months of this year, and in turn, investment firms saw their fees drop.
The pullback, while slight, is the first after 13 quarters of increasing demand for public cash and is perhaps the strongest sign yet that Wall Street's biggest and longest payday in history may be drawing to a close. 
 Corporations issued $262.1 billion in debt and equity securities in the first quarter, ended yesterday, down 2.6 percent from the $269.2 billion issued in the first three months of 1993, according to the Securities Data Company, a research company.
With years of interest rate declines, corporations rushed to refinance debt at lower costs, even as investors weresearching for higher yields. That search helped the equity markets, allowing companies to fetch top dollar for new stock issued to the public.
But now that interest rates are inching up, the trend is reversing. Corporations are holding fast to recently issued lower-rate debt, and the equity markets have been battered, making new equity issues more difficult.
So after more than three years of celebration on Wall Street, underwriters are looking ahead with concern. "Clearly if this market goes on, we're going to have a bit of trouble," said John R. Barber, managing director and head of equity capital markets at Kidder, Peabody & Company, a unit of the General Electric Company.
On the debt side, the drop in corporate issues was offset in part by a big increase in debt issues by Federal credit agencies. These issues jumped to their highest level ever for a three-month period.
As a result, underwriters said the quarter was busy, but far from exciting. "If you can have such a thing as a quiet $100 billion quarter, it was a quiet $100 billion quarter," said Grant Kvalheim, head of the debt capital markets desk at Merrill Lynch & Company.
The effects of the quarter's downturn are already being seen on Wall Street's bottom line. Disclosed fees dropped in the quarter to $2.1 billion, down 2.8 percent from the fees in the first quarter of last year.
The biggest underwriter for the quarter was Merrill, the perennial leader since 1988. The firm issued $43.1 billion of securities, capturing 16.5 percent of the market, down from 19.1 percent in the first quarter of 1993.
The big news on Wall Street was the performance of Kidder, Peabody, a firm that had seen its fortunes slide significantly since the late 1980's amid a series of missteps.
In a strong sign that the firm may have put its bad days behind it, Kidder jumped to second place as an underwriter, up from sixth in the first quarter of last year. Such a big move in the underwriting rankings is rare, and Wall Street executives said the firm's performance in the next few quarters would be critical in deciding whether it signaled a long-term recovery.
Almost all of the change came from Kidder's decision to focus on mortgage-backed debt, through issuing what are known as collateralized mortgage obligations, or C.M.O.'s. With C.M.O.'s, mortgages are pooled and separated by maturity. Those separate tranches, as they are called, then pay varying interest rates.
Kidder issued $29.2 billion in domestic new issues during the quarter, of which $25.4 billion, or 87 percent, were mortgage-backed debt.

HEADLINE: Fourth-Quarter '93 Gain For Economy Cut to 7%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The economy surged ahead at its briskest clip in 10 years in the closing months of 1993, the Commerce Department said today, even though growth was not quite as strong as previously projected.
The Government lowered its estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product from a month ago to show national output expanding at a 7 percent annual rate instead of 7.5 percent in the last quarter of 1993. 
 But it still was the strongest quarterly growth since the beginning of 1984, when the Reagan-era expansion hit its stride with a first-quarter gain of 7.9 percent.
The G.D.P. measures all goods and services produced by workers and capital in the United States.
 
 
Market Decline Eases
 Mounting evidence of solid expansion has driven long-term interest rates higher, sending the stock market into a five-day dive that finally appeared to lose steam today.
"The paradox is that the terrific performance of the economy in part has caused the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates," said Allen Sinai, a Lehman Brothers economist in New York.
"This is a very, very powerful upswing in the economy during the fourth quarter, driven by private spending and still with low inflation and it has continued into the first quarter," Mr. Sinai said.
Other economic reports today also showed strength.
The Chicago purchasing managers said their regional business barometer rose to a seasonally adjusted 66.5 in March from 60.3 in February with its employment measure the highest in five and a half years.
Brighter job prospects, usually associated with rising wages, showed up in a report from the Labor Department saying new jobless pay claims fell to 330,000 last week from 340,000 a week earlier.
And the Conference Board Help Wanted index, which tracks advertisements for new jobs, rose 10 points in February, to a seasonally adjusted 115 from 105 in January.
 
 
Further Growth Foreseen
 Even with harsh winter weather and a California earthquake, Mr. Sinai predicted that the gross domestic product would grow again in the current first quarter at a 3 to 3.5 percent rate -- a slower but still healthy rate of expansion.
The key reason for lowering fourth-quarter G.D.P. -- less inventory-building than first thought -- in fact suggested strength rather than slackening since it meant companies had leaner stocks of goods ready to sell as 1994 began.
The other reason for the revision was slightly less vigorous consumer spending than first estimated for the fourth quarter. But it was a smaller factor than lower inventories.

HEADLINE: For Many, Buyout Offer Is Too Small, Workers Say

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
In the corridors and offices of government buildings throughout New York City, municipal workers expressed skepticism yesterday over the severance packages that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is offering as a way to cut the size of government, saying the size of the money offers was unappealing.
But a few said they would jump at the chance to leave their jobs; some older workers saw it as an opportunity to retire early, while younger ones saw a chance to pursue other career goals. 
 Under an agreement that Mr. Giuliani and leaders of the municipal labor unions reached Wednesday evening, 80,000 workers will be offered sums ranging from $3,500 to $15,000 to leave their jobs. From the 80,000, the administration hopes to eliminate 7,600 positions.
Although administration and union officials were optimistic that enough workers would accept the offers, interviews with dozens of city workers yesterday indicated that the plan was not being embraced wholeheartedly.
 
'I Still Have Bills'
 "I don't want to be laid off, but I don't consider this severance package to be very appealing, either," said Sarah Peoples, a 36-year-old supervisor at the headquarters downtown of the city's Human Resources Administration.
With 11 years of service, Ms. Peoples, the mother of a 15-year-old son, would receive a $10,000 payment if she decided to take the severance package. "But then what would I do?" she asked. "I still have a son to support. I still have bills. Then what?"
Like Ms. Peoples, other workers spent the day grappling with what the plan meant for them. They wondered how far the money would take them. They asked themselves whether it was too late to begin another career or whether finding a new job was realistic in a city struggling to recover from a recession.
"I guess the Mayor is trying to downsize the government, and I understand that," said Edwardo Walker, a 34-year-old caseworker for the Human Resources Administration. "But I just came to this job in September after working for years as a salesman in clothing stores. I came here for the security. And a severance package of $3,500 isn't much security. I'm I going to take it? I don't think so."
At age 65 and with 30 years' tenure, James Flanagan is the kind of worker that administration officials consider the most likely to take the package. But Mr. Flanagan, who processes eligibility information for the Department of Social Services in an office in TriBeCa, said he was not interested.
"I don't really think it's that great," Mr. Flanagan said of the severance package. Although he is eligible to retire and plans to in a few years, he said: "You have to look at it very carefully. I have a job I enjoy."
Under the agreement, the severance offers will range from $3,500 or two weeks pay for newly hired workers to $15,000 for workers with 30 or more years of service, as well as nine months of health care benefits for all who accept the package.
Many workers said that they might take advantage of the offer if they were closer to retirement age or young enough to begin a new career or if they were interested in moving to another city. But most said they had families and roots in New York and did not see a severance package of, say, $10,000 as a sufficient nest egg in an uncertain economy.
"I don't like it," said a nutritional aide at the Queens office of the Department of Health, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I prefer to have my job. It makes absolutely no sense. What do they think they're dealing with, stupid people? Nobody should agree to this unless they are going to quit anyway."
However, a few said they welcomed the opportunity to move on.
"I've been here 11 years and I need a break," said David Ortiz, a 37-year-old manager at Human Resources. "To me, it's a fair offer. I want to go for a Ph.D. in social work administration. My feeling is, I'm young and I have time to create a new career. I'm not fearful of getting out there. But a lot of people are."
Julio Perez, who works for the tuberculosis division of the Department of Health in Jackson Heights, Queens, said many of his colleagues were considering taking the severance package. "Some of my friends say they hope they get it," Mr. Perez said. "In tuberculosis, the turnover is very high. Since most people are on the way out, they'll take the buyout."
Union offices were bombarded with questions from workers yesterday. Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America even set up a special telephone line with a recording explaining details of the severance package. "The phones are jumping, people calling in," said Stanley Hill, the executive director of the city's largest union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 
'People Will Be Devastated'
 Although many workers expressed concern about their own employment situations, they also pointed out the pain the work force reductions would cause in their agencies. "It's definitely going to hurt people," said Cheyenne Isom, who works in the infectious disease division of the tuberculosis control office. "Why cut programs that help people? A lot of people will be devastated."
He, too, said he finds the severance package unappealing. "Two weeks' severance pay is not enough for baby food," he said. "In four weeks you're out on the street."
Another worker in tuberculosis control, Damita Evans, said that the reduced staff will cripple services to patients. "Having less staff will hurt our patients," she said. "I know these people personally. The buyouts are not a good idea. I like my job. I want to be here for my patients."

With him was a co-worker, Damita Evans, second from left. (Steve Berman for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Spring Ritual In Albany: Lots of Talk, No Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 1

 BODY:
New York State began its fiscal year this morning without a budget, the 10th consecutive year that has happened, as negotiations between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature remained deadlocked over a broad range of issues.
Despite a full day of furious negotiations yesterday, Mr. Cuomo and leaders of the Democratic-controlled Assembly and Republican-controlled Senate could not agree on even the broad outlines of a budget by midnight, as they had hoped. 
 "It should be on time, there's no excuse for it not being on time," Mr. Cuomo said in an afternoon news briefing. "It is a more orderly thing."
The two houses did pass legislation providing nearly $12 billion for the operation of state agencies, ensuring that state workers will be paid next week. That bill also included $23 million intended to decrease prison overcrowding by creating 950 new prison beds.
But nearly every major budget issue, including whether the state should assume the Medicaid costs of county governments, what taxes to cut and how to allocate billions in aid to schools and local governments, remained unresolved.
 
'A Lot of Heavy Lifting'
 "There's a lot of heavy lifting yet to go," said John A. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican.
Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said through spokesmen that they hoped all three leaders could meet later this morning to reach a "handshake agreement" on a budget.
At best, aides to Mr. Cuomo and the leaders said, that agreement could provide a balance sheet overview of how to cut taxes, how to spend about $33 billion in the coming year and how much in revenue the state can expect. But negotiations over the difficult details of the budget will not really begin until next week.
Among the major sticking points in negotiations is how, and whether, the state should pick up Medicaid costs now borne by county governments. Mr. Cuomo has proposed a plan that would call for the state to assume those costs gradually over several years. Local Medicaid costs total $3.4 billion this year.
The Medicaid takeover plan is particularly important to New York City because Mr. Cuomo's plan had called for injecting $130 million into Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget for the city fiscal year beginning July 1. Mr. Giuliani is struggling to close a projected $2.3 billion deficit.
The three sides also remain far apart in talks over how much to cut taxes. Mr. Cuomo, when he introduced his $33.4 billion budget in January, proposed a package of business tax cuts totaling between $200 million and $300 million in this fiscal year.
But last week, the Senate offered a competing plan calling for $700 million in cuts, most of them for businesses. Mr. Cuomo and the Assembly Democrats argue that there is not enough money to make cuts that deep.
Just as thorny is the issue of how much money to give to local schools. Mr. Cuomo has called for increasing school aid by about $200 million in the coming year, but the Legislature is pushing to nearly double that amount.
One group closely watching the budget process is the bond raters who have given the state the second lowest bond ratings of the 50 states. Today, bond raters said that late budgets, while not a major reason for the low ratings, indicate the inability of Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature to agree on how to fix the state's fiscal problems.
"When other states were confronted with similar problems in the recession, many made hard decisions to cut services or raise taxes," said Catherine Fleischmann, a vice president with Moody's Investors Service.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise Following Early Slide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury prices recovered from an early plunge to end slightly higher yesterday as traders bought securities to unwind speculative positions ahead of the Government's report today on March employment.
The bond market will be closed today in observance of Good Friday. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond, down nearly a point in early trading, closed up 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 7.08 percent, from 7.09 percent on Wednesday, after surging above 7.18 percent in early trading.
Prices initially tumbled after the Chicago Purchasing Managers Association reported that its index of Midwest business activity rose sharply last month. A widely watched component that shows prices paid for raw materials was also up.
The report reinforced the inflationary fears that have hammered the market in recent weeks. Stronger economic growth can aggravate inflation, which erodes the value of fixed interest-bearing investments.
"This is a market that has an extreme intolerance to any strength reflected in economy numbers," said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets.
Aggravating the price decline, some managers of investment funds sold 7- and 10-year Treasury notes to minimize their losses in mortgage-based securities, said Frank Sannella, money market analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
But the Treasury market regained ground, partly because the tumblng stock market reassured some traders that investors would seek out fixed-income securities as an alternative.
 
Employment Data Awaited
 Bond traders also braced for a key barometer of economic performance, the March employment report. Short-sellers, who had sold borrowed securities with the intention of profiting from a price decline, bought them back in order to close out their positions before the weekend, since the bond market is closed today. The heightened demand prompted by these purchases drove prices up in what is known as a short-covering rally.
Short-term Treasury issues fell 1/32 point, while Treasury notes with intermediate maturities rose 2/32 to 4/32 of a point.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.12, to 1,244.55.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, surged to 4.5 percent ahead of the holiday weekend, up from 3.36 percent late Wednesday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9118/32 , down 19/32 from late Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was 6.36 percent, up from 6.26 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Concerns Over U.S. Stocks and Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday as weakness in the stock and bond markets and uncertainty ahead of a holiday weekend prompted investors to sell.
Stocks and bonds were lower for much of the day although they recovered somewhat near the close. Analysts said this weakness was enough to drive the dollar lower. 
 Concerns about the Government's report today on March unemployment also persuaded investors to sell dollars.
"People were just divesting," said Hillel Waman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company. "Foreign money that was invested in the dollar market disappeared."
Mr. Waxman said the weakness in stocks and bonds was prompting investors -- particularly market participants from overseas -- to pull their money out of dollar-denominated investments, driving down demand.
 
New U.S.-Japan Concerns
 Also putting pressure on the dollar were new concerns about trade tension between the United States and Japan, as Washington singled out Tokyo as the worst offender when it released its annual hit list of countries erecting egregious barriers to trade.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 102.75 Japanese yen from 102.85 yen.
The dollar also fell to 1.6730 German marks from 1.6755 marks.
The stock and bond markets in the United States will be closed today in observance of Good Friday and many overseas markets will also be closed. But there will be limited currency trading.
The stock market experienced its worst weekly decline since October 1989 this week. Bond prices have weakened as well, ever since the Federal Reserve decided in early February to push up short-term interest rates to head off inflation.
Normally, higher interest rates tend to help the dollar, noted Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group.
Several economic reports that showed the economy growing corporate profits up in the final quarter of 1993 were not enough to stem the dollar selling.
The British pound was trading late in New York at $1.4845, up from $1.4795 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Wednesday, included: 1.4125 Swiss francs, down from 1.4185; 5.7180 French francs, down from 5.7265; 1,613.00 Italian lire, down from 1,630.00 and $1.3825 (Canadian), up from $1.3793

HEADLINE: Prepaying Mortgage Adds Up to Big Savings

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Michael and Maria Walters, like millions of other Americans, refinanced their mortgage last year, paring their monthly payments and saving thousands of dollars in interest. But they didn't stop there.
The Walters are adding $134.46 to their new monthly payment of $902.44 to reduce the loan principal. At this pace, they will pay off their $127,500 fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage in 20 years and save $76,019 in interest over the life of their new loan. 
 "It is amazing," Mrs. Walters said. "For just a little bit more money, it makes so much difference."
No statistics are available on how many Americans are regularly prepaying their mortgages by using what some homeowners call "pocket change." The number, though, is thought to be increasing. Indeed, with the number of refinancings declining and mortgage interest rates rising, prepaying may now be the most practical way to shorten the length of a mortgage or hold down costs.
"It doesn't pay to take that extra money that it costs to refinance into a new loan," if there is not a difference of at least two percentage points in the interest rates, said Anita Amlong, a mortgage consultant with Hudson City Savings in Rhinebeck, N.Y. "People would be better off prepaying on the principal."
The technique is a simple one, and borrowers should be wary of expensive software and books that promise to show the best way to prepay a mortgage. Products like the Mortgage Controller often provide little more than mortgage amortization tables, which are generally available in bookstores at a fraction of the cost.
Borrowers should also scrutinize services with official-sounding names like the BiSaver Program and Billie Mac, the Biweekly Mortgage Acceptance Corporation. Borrowers send mortgage payments once every two weeks to these services, which then pay the lenders; the 26 installments result in an extra monthly payment each year, which is supposed to reduce the mortgage principal.
In some cases, the additional payment, when received by the lender, is not applied to principal but is deposited in an escrow account for taxes or credited partly or entirely toward interest.
"People should not waste any money on middlemen to do something they can arrange for themselves with their lender," said Paul Richard, vice president and director of education for the National Center for Financial Education, a nonprofit organization based in San Diego.
All it usually takes to pay off a mortgage early, Mr. Richard said, is putting an extra amount in the monthly mortgage check. A note should be made on the payment coupon stating that the additional money is to be credited toward principal.
Follow up with a phone call to the lender after the first prepayment, he said, to make sure it is properly credited. "People get into trouble sometimes when they just send in the extra money without an explanation," he said.
Aside from overpriced, gimmicky services, there are a few useful and inexpensive guides, Mr. Richard added. He likes the Banker's Secret, a computer program selling for $39.95, which helps homeowners calculate how much they will save if they prepay various amounts. It could be particularly useful for someone who wants to pay off a loan before an anticipated life event, like retirement or a child's entering college. The Banker's Secret is also available in book form for $14.95. (Good Advice Press, Elizaville, N.Y., 12523. 800 255-0899.)
"If folks have the extra money, prepaying is something that they should definitely do," Mr. Richard said. "We recommend that people do everything they can to reduce debt."
Of course, taking out a shorter-term mortgage, like a 15-year loan, can result in similar savings. With a shorter-term loan, however, credit hurdles may be higher, and down payment requirements may be larger. Borrowers are also locked into bigger payments each month.
"Prepaying gives you flexibility," said Mrs. Walters, who stays at home to care for Lisa, 7, and Diana, 3, while Mr. Walters works as a police officer. "If there is an emergency, and you need money for something, you can get it by cutting back on the extra amount you are paying."
Even homeowners with 15-year mortgages, already saving substantial amounts in comparison with 30-year mortgages, can save more interest -- and build equity faster -- by prepaying. For example, a 15-year $100,000 mortgage at 7.5 percent can be paid off eight months sooner by adding $25 to every $927.02 payment, and $3,585 in interest will be saved.
Rob Rosenblatt, director of surveys for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade group based in Washington, said most lenders no longer had or enforced penalties for such prepayments. "It has become a standard practice to accept them, and the service departments are already geared up for them," he said.
Where prepayment penalties exist, they often cover just the first few years of a mortgage, said Marc Eisenson, publisher of the Bankers Secret, and they are minute, generally 1 percent of the amount prepaid.
Prepayment penalties are remnants from the days when there were few fees or closing costs associated with a mortgage, he added. Today, closing costs and fees more than cover lenders' losses on prepayments.
"Nowadays, you can even ask the lender to remove the prepayment penalty from the mortgage, and they are very likely to," he said.
A final note of caution: homeowners should make prepayments only after they have paid debts with higher interest rates. "If you have credit cards charging 16 percent, you should definitely pay that down before you prepay your mortgage," Mr. Eisenson said.

HEADLINE: 456,000 Jobs Added in March, Largest Payroll Gain in 6 Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Rebounding strongly from the effects of harsh midwinter weather, the economy generated 456,000 new jobs in March, the largest expansion of employers' payrolls in more than six years and nearly twice the growth that analysts had expected, the Labor Department reported today.
At the same time, the unemployment rate, which is calculated from a separate survey of the nation's households, was unchanged at 6.5 percent, the department said. 
 The agency's monthly jobs report, combined with separate figures from the Commerce Department showing hefty advances in incomes and spending for February, sent interest rates soaring in limited holiday trading.
Traders and investors fear that overly rapid economic expansion will revive inflation at a time the Federal Reserve is trying to quell any such outbreak before it becomes evident.
The 30-year bond, a benchmark for long-term interest rates, plunged $19.38 for each $1,000 of face value in a shortened trading session, raising its yield to new buyers to 7.26 percent, from 7.08 percent. [Page 35.]
The nation's stock exchanges, which failed in strenuous attempts over several weeks to persuade the Government to switch publication of the employment data to either Thursday or Monday, were closed in observance of Good Friday. Because officials would not give in, investors were largely precluded from reacting, from Thursday afternoon to Monday morning, to news that deviated more than usual from economists' expectations.
At a White House briefing, the President's top economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, said the bond market seemed to be "overreacting" in its extended slide. She said inflation remained subdued, or was still declining, by almost every published measure.
"The picture is a moderate, sustainable recovery with very little in the way of inflationary pressure," Ms. Tyson said of the results an nounced today. She said she was sticking with a forecast for 1994 of 3 percent economic growth and two million more jobs.
The economy raced ahead at a rate of 7 percent in the final quarter of 1993, a level that nobody expects will be sustained in the face of restraining forces like tax increases, higher interest rates and significantly lower car production.
The University of Michigan struck a cautionary note today when it informed subscribers to its consumer survey that confidence had eased in March to a reading of 91.5 in its overall index, from 93.2 in February. That was in contrast to a sharp gain in consumer confidence reported this week by the Conference Board.
In yet another report, the Commerce Department said the value of construction at schools, factories, churches, highways, houses and other public and private projects amounted to $488.8 billion at an annual rate in February, 1.2 percent below the January pace.
 
 
Broad Gains in Jobs
 But the surprisingly good employment report dominated the economic news. The payroll expansion impressed analysts perhaps as much for its breadth as for its magnitude.
The construction industry added 74,000 jobs, lifting employment after two months of declines to well above the level that prevailed before the onset of especially severe winter weather.
Factories added 12,000 jobs in March, the sixth consecutive monthly gain; factories had shed 1.8 million jobs from the start of 1989 to last September, said Katharine G. Abraham, Commissioner of Labor Statistics.
Almost all categories of service jobs posted sizable gains, including a second straight jump in business services, mainly reflecting temporary help and employee leasing. Health services grew by 45,000 jobs, more than twice the average for January and February. Gains in restaurants and bars accounted for almost half of a jump of 74,000 retailing jobs.
The economic expansion "broadened considerably," said Mark Vitner, economist at the First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., suggesting that growth in the quarter that ended Thursday could be in a range of 3.5 to 4 percent.
 
 
Longer Hours
 Also impressive, analysts said, was the fact that factory workers put in longer hours, an average of 42.2 a week, and more overtime, at 4.8 hours, than at any time since World War II. The factory workweek soared by a full hour, more than making up for a decline of 36 minutes in February.
 The department's survey of households showed considerably less vigor -- in fact, employment declined by 221,000 -- but analysts noted that the survey had been overhauled and should probably be considered less reliable than the payroll survey -- at least until new seasonal adjustment factors are available.
This decline in jobs, about matched by a decline of 196,000 in the labor force, left the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.5 percent, the same as the fourth-quarter average.
Among the unusually large gyrations were a 184,000 rise in the ranks of people out of work for less than five weeks and a drop of 178,000 among people jobless for 5 to 14 weeks. Normally, such a jump in the newly unemployed would be an ominous sign of job-market deterioration, but officials discounted this move since it was not confirmed by weekly reports of first-time jobless claims.
Officials also attributed various suspect results to the overhaul of the household survey, which included changes in definitions and phrasing; the new survey was introduced with the figures for January. And they particularly noted that they must continue to rely on seasonal adjustment factors based on information collected under the old method.
Today's report also showed a very large increase -- 349,000, to a total of five million -- in the number of people working part time who wanted full-time employment, the so-called partly unemployed. This, however, was thought to be unreliable because of the faulty seasonal adjustment and because of a new definition.
The number of people with two or more jobs climbed 150,000 last month, to account for 5.9 percent of employed people, from 5.8 percent in February.
The total of so-called discouraged workers -- those who have given up looking for jobs because they think they cannot find any -- rose by 44,000 in March, to 533,000.
Among the largest states, only three showed changes of clear statistical significance in their unemployment rates. These were jumps of 1.7 points for Pennsylvania and 1.6 points for Florida, and a decline of 1.4 points for Michigan.
The jobless rates were mixed in the two largest states. California's rate dropped to 8.6 percent in March, from 9 percent in February. In New York State, the rate rose to 8.1 percent, from 7.8 percent in February.
In New Jersey, the rate was 7.9 percent, compared with 7.3 percent in February.

HEADLINE: Charlotte's Downtown Manages To Stay Up Late for Tournament

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 1

 BODY:
It's been called Potemkin Village with a drawl.
Whatever it is, the basketball fans and corporate bigwigs flocking to this shiny banking center for college basketball's Final Four weekend are enjoying a new dimension in disposable culture -- an instant downtown as permanent as a movie set. 
 Charlotte's downtown -- it goes by the perky appellation of "uptown" here -- has been abuzz since Thursday night with a vibrant street life of youngsters bouncing Pizza Hut basketballs, revelers slurping pina coladas and hoop fans strolling to and from clubs offering everything from country to Cajun to comedy. The festivities are concentrated in a four-block area just off the heart of downtown that is modestly being called "The Street of Champions."
Come Tuesday, most of this bustling entertainment zone will revert back to the somnolent streetscape of abandoned buildings and vacant lots it was at the beginning of the week.
"We have never pretended that this was anything more than a temporary fix," said Brandon Uttley, a spokesman for the Charlotte Organizing Commitee, which raised $2 million to lure and stage the Final Four and created the entertainment zone. "Charlotte is a city of suburbs, a city of malls. We needed to augment what was already uptown."
But in this prosperous citadel of gleeful sprawl, where the booster gene is the dominant biological strain, the effort has a familiar ring.
"The shame of it is that the city looks absolutely gorgeous," said Ron Morgan, a local architect and former professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "It's swept clean and polished. But nobody's there. We've created the most beautiful downtown of any new city in the United States, but in many ways it's empty and antiseptic."
Indeed, Charlotte's shiny new collage of mirrored glass, capped by the 60-story Nations Bank Corporate Center, has the eerily immaculate feel of an instant metropolis. The trouble is, it is pretty much a ghost town outside 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. on weekdays.
"Usually, there's no one here," said Brian Murphy of nearby Denver, N.C., as he sampled the wares today at Fat Tuesday's, which for five days will be dispensing frozen daiquiris, "jungle juice" and something ominously called "190 octane" from an other-times vacant savings and loan building. "Downtown is empty after 5 P.M. There's nothing to do."
So the organizing committee brought in six clubs, four in vacant buildings, two in huge tents placed on vacant lots, plus armies of street vendors, to create instant night life and grazing stations for the fans coming to see Duke, Arkansas, Arizona and Florida face off in college basketball's biggest event.
The Comedy Zone, a fast-paced entertainment spot, is next door to The Zone, a noisy sports bar and disco. There's Cajun music, black beans and rice and jambalaya at Mardi Gras, while country music serenades listeners at Diamond Spur. The shop hawking Final Four souvenirs and T-shirts at the corner of Third Street and South Tryon either occupies a building that used to house a financial institution, or it is the only T-shirt shop in history insured by the F.D.I.C.
 
Meeting Visitors' Needs
 The businesses are renting the space and giving 15 percent of their gross to the organizing committee.
Organizers say the idea is to meet visitors' entertainment needs, not to fool anyone.
"I guess that it's fake and chicanery when your in-laws come to see you on Easter and you go out and cut the yard and rake up the leaves," said Johnny Harris, chairman of the organizing committee. "You know we have about 3,200 restaurant seats in uptown Charlotte. If you figure 25 percent of the 80,000 people coming to town will end up uptown that's 20,000 people. If they want to eat, what are they going to do in 3,200 seats?"
Still, in this famously eager-to-please town, where even the normally gung-ho Charlotte Observer today headlined one column -- "Please try to like us a lot. Please." -- the effort has drawn considerable notice.
 
'Anything to Please'
 In the spirit of the occasion, a local weekly, Creative Loafing, printed a picture of the New York skyline on its cover with the words, "Welcome to Charlotte! Final Four Fans, We'll Do Anything to Please You." Inside it offered its own tour of "The City of Champions" with the White House as the Mayor's Mansion, The Eiffel Tower as James K. Polk's birthplace, and the Taj Mahal as the city's Mint Museum.
To be sure, if Charlotte is the kind of place inordinately given to showing off, part of that reflects the fact that it has a lot to crow about these days.
Charlotte and Atlanta have consistently vied with each other to lead the nation in job growth over the last five years. Largely because of the breakneck growth of Nations Bank, it has become the nation's third largest banking center, behind New York and San Francisco. Its unemployment rate is below 4 percent.
"I resent the suggestion that we're just all image," said Mayor Richard Vinroot, noting Charlotte successes ranging from scattered-site housing for the poor to a successfully integrated school system. "We're the No. 1 job creating city in America. That's substance. That's what it's all about."
City officials add that a new convention center and new football stadium, along with concert and cultural institutions at the other end of downtown, will begin breathing more life into the area. Others are less sure, saying Charlotte's glossy skyscrapers, connected by antiseptic skyways and filled with elegant urban malls, and its suburban culture are antithetical to the urban feel the Street of Champions is artificially creating.
And no one denies that Charlotte has its share of drugs, crime, poverty and the other ills of modern urban life.
"They've taken a lot of vacant buildings and built a temporary circus, but when the circus leaves, there's nothing left behind," said Burton Gellman, who recently closed a restaurant and jazz club that vainly tried to make it downtown. "Charlotte is nothing more than one large suburban community. People in Charlotte are scared to death of the center city."
Still, for now, the dogwoods are in bloom, the President is coming to town, North Carolina fell but Duke made it to the final games; even the few cynics can't get too upset.
"You know, these days, when so many cities have clouds hanging over them and people afraid, this place is really not too bad," said Bob Raiford, a radio disk jockey with a reputation for being a perennial malcontent. "As much as I try to be a burr under their saddle, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else."
He paused, thinking of all the well-scrubbed movers and shakers bustling around town, and added, "I really think, though, if you added some ladies' coleslaw wrestling, something that would bring in a lot of bikers, it might liven things up, wouldn't you think?"

The Economy
 
More Americans found jobs in March than in any month in six years, the Labor Department reported. The economy generated 456,000 new jobs in March, nearly twice the growth that analysts had expected. At the same time, the unemployment rate, which is calculated from a separate survey of the nation's households, was unchanged at 6.5 percent. [Page 1.] Employment in New York City increased sharply in March, but was little changed in New York State and New Jersey, the agency said. [36.]
 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani won the crucial approval of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to use a $200 million surplus to pay for severance packages the Mayor hopes will cut 7,600 jobs from New York City's municipal work force. [1.]
 
 
Markets
 
The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 7.26 percent, the highest since January 1993, in limited and thin holiday trading, reacting to the surprisingly strong jobs data. The price of the long-bond dropped, but the decline may have been exaggerated by the absence of many investors on Good Friday. The stock market and most futures markets were closed. [35.]
 
The moves by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates took a toll on a wide swath of stocks in the first quarter of 1994, many included in closely watched benchmark averages. [38.]
 
The dollar jumped against most leading currencies as American interest rates surged after the Government's report showing the biggest jobs gain since 1987. [38.]
 
 
International
 
Two Chicago entrepreneurs see a $1 billion market in instant lotteries in the former Soviet Union, where they are aggressively using Western-style marketing to generate interest. [35.]

HEADLINE: Jobs Data Push Rates Up Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates climbed to their highest point in 14 months yesterday, as traders rushed to sell Treasury securities after the Government reported that the growth in jobs in March was far stronger than expected.
Trading was very thin in a short Good Friday session, exaggerating the price moves. Several analysts called the selloff an overreaction and were quick to question how much the surge in interest rates reflected the market's underlying sentiment. 
 "It's not justified, and the selling has reached the point of absurdity," said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst at MMS International.
Analysts also wondered how the bond and stock markets would react on Monday in a full trading session.
Little bond trading had been expected yesterday because the stock market and most other markets were closed in observance of Good Friday. But the strong employment report set off selling in Treasury futures trading in Chicago, which quickly spread to the cash market in New York.
Although the Public Securities Association had recommended closing the Treasury market for Good Friday, many securities firms had taken the precaution of having skeleton trading staffs on hand in case the employment report caused any market turbulence.
It certainly did.
 
A Surprisingly Big Number
 At 8:30 A.M., Eastern time, the Labor Department reported that the economy had created 456,000 jobs in March, the largest expansion of employers' payrolls in more than six years and nearly twice the growth that analysts had expected.
Almost immediately, traders began dumping Treasury securities on fears that the Federal Reserve would move again to push up interest rates in an effort to head off inflation in a rapidly growing economy. Within 30 minutes, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond had fallen about 2 points, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, surged to about 7.28 percent.
Trading ended before noon, with the 30-year bond down 129/32 , to 8727/32 , and its yield at 7.26 percent, up from 7.08 percent on Thursday. The 7.26 percent yield was the highest since Jan. 21, 1993, when the 30-year bond yielded 7.29 percent.
For investors holding 30-year bonds, the price decline meant a loss of $19.38 for each $1,000 invested.
For the week, the 30-year bond has risen a quarter of a percentage point.
Yields of other short- and intermediate-term Treasuries were also driven higher yesterday. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose 13 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.60 percent. The yield on the five-year Treasury note rose to 6.43 percent, from 6.21 percent on Thursday, while the yield on the 10-year note jumped to 6.93 percent, from 6.73 percent.
The March employment report also showed that the jobless rate remained at 6.5 percent. But other figures reinforced the notion that the economy was surging. The Government said personal income rose 1.3 percent and spending increased 1 percent in February, the largest gains for both figures since last April.
Investors had been hoping that the economy would begin to slow, reducing any pressure the Fed might feel to push up interest rates. Some analysts said the strong pickup in new jobs in March reinforced the bond market's notion that interest rates were headed higher.
But other analysts are not sure how much the stronger-than-expected gain in employment was a result of weather distortions and how much was from a genuine acceleration in economic growth. They said the economy's average growth rate over the first quarter suggests that growth is not accelerating as much as yesterday's employment report would imply.
 
A Dissenting View
 Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, disagreed, saying he thought that the monthly average for job growth in the quarter, of 208,000 jobs, understated the true trend rate of payroll growth. "I see 250,000 to 300,000 in terms of trend, which is stronger than people have assumed," he said.
The bond market will be putting an intense focus on April's employment report, which will be released next month before the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee meets on May 17. The committee will decide what further action, if any, to take on interest rates.
Analysts at MMS International, a market research and analysis firm, quoted a Federal Reserve governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., as saying yesterday that the Fed must "see what the future brings" in terms of setting rates.
Mr. Kelley reportedly said that the market was being jolted by "emotion," and that he did not expect a surge of inflation, adding that there was still slack in the economy, though it may be diminishing.
 Mr. Fine said he expected the Fed to make its next move relatively soon, but he thought that would be good for the bond market.
"The sooner they get to 4 percent on the Federal funds rate the better in terms of convincing the bond market that its inflationary fears are overblown," Mr. Fine said. "And to tell you the truth, I don't know if the next move will be 25 basis points or 50 basis points."
Since Feb. 4, the Fed has moved twice to push up the Federal funds rate, the overnight rate on loans between banks. The rate has risen to 3.5 percent from 3 percent.
Mr. Hale of MMS International called yesterday's bond market selloff a "blood bath."
"There was no question that the reports were bearish in nature," he said. "You have to realize it's even more bearish considering the market's condition and its frenzied state. Anything that hints of bearish news is magnified by the nervous market."

Keeping Alive a Dream Snatched Off the Streets

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman 

 BODY:
JUST as Huberta Schroedel, a deaf educator, was about to seize her dream and open a newsstand where she could train deaf students to run their own businesses, someone stole the kiosk.
In mid-Manhattan, on Tuesday, in broad daylight, somebody took the entire structure in which Ms. Schroedel had invested more than $25,000 and years of effort. 
 "I first noticed it was gone when I came back from work," said the 50-year-old woman, who last saw the stand eight hours earlier as she passed it on her way to the campus of LaGuardia Community College in Queens, where she works with deaf youngsters.
"I was shocked, devastated. I freaked out," she said. "I just stood there at the spot on 57th Street near Ninth Avenue looking at nothing but the sidewalk. My little boy looked at me and told me not to cry."
"Who would steal a newsstand?" asked the robust blonde woman, still looking dazed two days after the theft. She said some shopkeepers on West 57th Street told her they had seen three men loading the stand onto a truck around noon, apparently in no hurry.
Though Ms. Schroedel appeared momentarily defeated, she is normally resolute, and her friends expect her to struggle on. They point out that not only had she fought hard to get as far as she did with the idea, but that she also had managed to earn two master's degrees, a principal's license, and to become a mother at the age of 45.
"I first thought of the newsstand six years ago," she explained. "I felt I could supplement my income and at the same time provide business training for deaf high-school students."
She applied for and received a license from the Department of Consumer Affairs. She designed the steel-and-wood kiosk and had it built. She took courses in business practices offered by the American Women's Economic Development Corporation, an organization that encourages women to be entrepreneurs. She began ordering publications and merchandise. When Con Edison demanded $15,000 to install electricity and the phone company asked for a similar amount, Ms. Schroedel contacted local officials who helped her negotiate more affordable terms.
"I also signed up five young people to work with me as interns," Ms. Schroedel said after answering questions for a detective. "Now there is nothing," she said. She shook her head and repeated, "Who would steal a newsstand?"
Robert Bookman, the head of the New York City Newsstand Operators Association, said he had never heard of such a crime. "Nobody steals news stands," said the director of the trade group. "We've had instances of vandalism and holdups, but never the complete removal of a stand."
Mr. Bookman, who had helped Ms. Schroedel obtain her license, said his first reaction after he heard of the stand was that perhaps the city had ordered it removed, because of some administrative ruling, or by mistake.
But Pat Cohen, a spokesperson for the Department of Consumer Affairs, which is supposed to know about any such move, reported that the city was not involved.
So who did? And why?
 Mr. Bookman said the only other motive he could imagine was that "people who did not want or did not like the idea of a newsstand being operated in that location may have decided to take the law into their own hands." He said he knew of instances in which newsstands had been vandalized for such reasons.
He said he had heard that, during the two years the stand stood unused, some neighborhood people had complained about it. But Ms. Cohen said there was no record of any complaints.
And on West 57th Street, as Ms. Schroedel was left wondering whether the police would find the thieves and recover the stand or whether her insurance would pay for the loss, the only comments on this day reflected sympathy for the would-be entrepreneur, and wonder at what the world was coming to.
The desk clerk at the Henry Hudson Hotel said he was aware the stand outside the hotel doors had vanished and he had heard it had been stolen. "That's terrible," he said. "We're living in craziness."
The manager of Body Holiday, a beauty shop, said she saw the stand being dismantled and assumed Ms. Schroedel, whom she knew on sight, had decided to move it elsewhere or to abandon the project. "I never thought they were stealing," she said. "How could you think something like that? It's like stealing a hydrant or stealing a street."
Or, as Ms. Schroedel is learning, like stealing a dream.

HEADLINE: Scandal Threatens Japan Premier's Hold on Power

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 1

 BODY:
With his coalition Government already pulling apart at the seams, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been plunged into a new crisis over questionable financial transactions that pose an increasingly serious threat to his precarious hold on power.
For days now Mr. Hosokawa, who was elected last year because of his image as a clean outsider ready to change the corrupt world of Tokyo politics, has been forced to answer questions about his financial dealings while he was governor of one of Japan's southern prefectures. There are widespread suspicions, which Mr. Hosokawa denies, that he received a $1 million loan from a trucking company now in the center of other political scandals and diverted it to a secret political fund. 
 While Mr. Hosokawa's political enemies have demanded answers and documents, Parliament has been frozen and the country entered a new fiscal year today without a budget.
 
Rising Tensions With U.S.
 The budget delay also worsens tension with the United States, which is pressing Tokyo for a quick, large-scale stimulation of the economy to boost imports. With Mr. Hosokawa's approval ratings having dropped below the 50 percent level, American officials say they are increasingly concerned that the growing political turmoil could force him out or derail any chance for Japan to make progress on its trade disputes in the first half of this year.
"It is beginning to look very serious," a senior American official here said this week. "Once again, everyone is wondering whether he will survive."
One of the questionable transactions involves a million dollar loan from the company at the center of the scandal that pulled down the Liberal Democrats, who were ousted from office last summer for the first time in 38 years.
Seeing a chance to taint Mr. Hosokawa with the same brush, the Liberal Democrats have stopped all legislative action for nearly four weeks now and turned parliamentary sessions into an inquisition. Mr. Hosokawa spent much of the week under harsh questioning and sidestepped repeated demands that he resign.
 
Trucking Company Loan
 The $1 million loan was made in 1982, just as Mr. Hosokawa became Governor of Kumamoto. Mr. Hosokawa said he borrowed the money from the Tokyo Sagawa transportation company, which at the time was beginning to pump cash to politicians as it sought regulatory clearance to expand its routes in Japan. He said he used the money to buy a small apartment in a Tokyo neighborhood and to repair his house in Kumamoto.
Mr. Hosokawa has insisted that he paid the loan back. But his only evidence that the loan was repaid is a receipt for the last installment, and the receipt does not bear the name of the lender or a seal or stamp, all of which are customary.
The company removed any claim regarding the loan in late 1991, though under Japanese law that does not necessarily mean the loan was paid back. The official recording of that change took more than a year, and happened just a few months before Mr. Hosokawa became Prime Minister.
Mr. Hosokawa has said he is unable to find other receipts, and he has twice changed the account of how he paid the money back. He will not permit his former secretary, Masatoshi Fukayama, to testify.
"If the loan has been for secret political funds, how could I have done such conspicuous things?" he asked on Wednesday.
 
Questions on Stock Purchase
 There are also questions of how Mr. Hosokawa's family obtained 300 shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone stock when the nationally controlled telecommunications company was sold to the public in 1986.
It was a virtual certainty that the shares would soar in value, so the stock offering was oversubscribed. Most investors were able to buy only a fraction of the stock they sought. But the Hosokawas managed to obtain all 300 shares they asked for, reportedly paying around $4 million. After the stock rose in value, two-thirds of the shares were sold to pay off the loan that financed their purchase, leaving a profit of roughly $500,000.
Mr. Hosokawa has angrily insisted that the transaction was in the name of his wife's father, who died last year, and that he was not involved. But a financial adviser said this week that he had arranged the loan to finance the purchase with one of Mr. Hososkawa's political aides.
Mr. Hosokawa said on Thursday that he has never met the consultant, Shuzo Fujiki. But, obviously exasperated, he raised his voice at politicians questioning him about the transaction, saying "Supposing it was my deal, what's wrong with that?"

HEADLINE: Budget Deal Announced But Details Are Lacking

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 1

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the state's legislative leaders announced today that they had reached an agreement on the broad parameters of a $34 billion state budget, but then broke for the holiday weekend without actually enacting the budget or even providing details of their plan.
So for the 10th consecutive year, the state fiscal year started today without a budget in place, and there was no clear indication of when one would be adopted. 
 In a sketchily worded press release, Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders said the agreement would cut taxes, increase aid to local schools, create a college scholarship program for poor students and finance new construction projects.
Though state officials were reluctant to release details, some said the tax cuts, mostly for businesses, would be worth between $410 million and $460 million, a relatively small slice of the more than $30 billion the state expects to collect in taxes next year. School aid would be increased by about $400 million from the current $9.1 billion, they said, and the construction projects would include repairs to New York City schools and the building of new stadiums in upstate cities.
But Mr. Cuomo and the leaders failed to reach agreement on the Governor's proposal to have the state assume all Medicaid costs now borne by county governments, which this year are expected to reach $3.4 billion. Instead, they agreed on the broad outlines of a plan to have the state take over a small portion of those costs.
It seemed likely that the agreement would fall short of providing the $275 million in additional state aid that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had already calculated into his budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. But it seemed likely to come close to providing the $130 million that Mr. Giuliani had projected would come from a Medicaid takeover plan.
Officials close to the negotiations said New York City would receive about $130 million partly through state assumption of some Medicaid costs and partly through a new form of aid to all local governments.
"It is our belief that we will satisify the $130 million in the city's fiscal year," said Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker and a Manhattan Democrat. "Everybody's committed to doing that."
Last year, one minute after midnight on the first day of the fiscal year, Mr. Cuomo and the leaders also announced a budget agreement, then shook hands for television cameras and rushed off without providing details. It then took five days for the actual budget to be adopted.
Mr. Cuomo and all 211 lawmakers are up for re-election this fall, and chronically late state budgets have been a popular anti-incumbent theme in past races. Wall Street credit-rating firms have also said that late budgets are a factor in their decisions about grading state bonds, which currently have the second-lowest rating among the 50 states.
Even some officials close to the negotiations cast today's agreement in sardonic terms. "It's certainly not a handshake; it might have been a long-distance wink," said one of those officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Silver and his Senate counterpart, Ralph J. Marino, the majority leader and an Oyster Bay Republican, will seek approval of the agreement from their party colleagues on Monday. Until then, aides to both men said they could not release more information out of concerns that lawmakers would object to reading such details in newspapers before hearing them firsthand.
 
Benefits for Businesses
 "It's more important to get this done as quickly as possible," said John A. McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Marino. He said that full adoption of the budget is not likely until late next week.
Most of the tax cuts are likely to be for businesses. When he introduced his budget in January, Mr. Cuomo recommended a package of reductions that included reducing the corporate surcharge to 12.5 percent from 15 percent, phasing out the 5 percent state tax on hotel rooms that rent for over $100 and giving poor working families a credit on the state's personal income taxes.
Since then, Mr. Cuomo has added a proposal to give companies a tax credit on operating losses dating back to 1990. All together, Mr. Cuomo's tax cut proposals would cost the state about $250 million in revenue during this fiscal year.
Last week, the Senate Republicans released their own tax cut plan that would call for $700 million in reductions, almost all for busineses, in the coming fiscal year. The plan included all of Mr. Cuomo's cuts, but deepened some, speeded up others and added several more to the list.
Today's agreement included a proposal from the Governor to create scholarships for poor high school graduates seeking to attend college in New York State. Known as Liberty Scholarships, the program was to have begun in 1991, but no money was provided because of budget cuts during the recession. Mr. Cuomo had asked for $68 million to start the program this year, but it was not clear whether he received that much in the agreement.
Under the agreement, the state capital budget will include several major construction projects sought by lawmakers. The Senate Republicans had requested over $60 million for new stadiums, swimming pools and recreational centers for the suburban towns and upstate cities many of them represent.
The Assembly Democrats had in turn sought about $60 million for a special fund to repair decrepit schools in New York City and its suburbs. It was not clear how much was allocated to each side, but officials close to the negotiations said the final amounts would be close to both sides' original requests.
They also agreed not to do several things that Mr. Cuomo had proposed when he introduced his budget in January. They rejected, for the second straight year, a proposal to create a state-run Keno game, which Mr. Cuomo said would have generated $74 million in state revenue this year.
They also killed a proposal by Mr. Cuomo to have the state take $70 million in unclaimed bottle deposits from beverage distributors. The money would have been used for park improvements, protecting wild land and closing landfills. Mr. Cuomo has said he will continue his efforts to seize the unclaimed deposits after the budget is adopted.

HEADLINE: After Fed Moves, the Quarter Ends Badly for Many Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
After playing host at a three-year party for the stock market, the Federal Reserve Board in the first quarter did what its former chairman, William McChesney Martin, once said the central bank inevitably had to do: It took away the punch bowl.
Not surprisingly, stocks were not ready for the music to stop when the Fed on Feb. 4 nudged up short-term interest rates, making it more expensive to borrow money. A second move by the Fed to raise short-term rates on March 22 only made it worse. 
 The message was not the sort that stock investors wanted to hear, especially after they piled money into shares as the Fed sharply lowered interest rates over the first three years of the decade. As such, the first three months of 1994 ended on a decidedly more discordant note for the stock market than they began.
"It was a gut-wrenching quarter," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm.
The steep rise in interest rates that occurred in the first quarter took a toll on a wide range of stocks, many included in the closely watched market indexes. But the quarter was a good one for a large number of stocks, especially those whose fortunes are tied to a healthy economy.
Of the nearly 6,000 issues tracked by Media General Financial Services, more than 3,700 declined in value during the first quarter, while almost 2,100 moved higher. Just 163 emerged unchanged.
The brunt of the damage was done on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues outnumbered gainers by a ratio of more than 2 to 1. Losers also outnumbered winners on both the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, but by a much smaller order of magnitude.
That weakness dragged down the Big Board's important averages: the blue-chip Dow index fell 3.15 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 4.43 percent and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.29 percent.
More important, according to David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, was the year-over-year change in the S.& P. 500 index. For the first time since 1990, he said, the index ended a quarter lower than it had been a year earlier.
 
Climbing With the Economy
 Among industry groups, the quarter's best performers were generally those closely tied to upswings in the economy, a group that included engineering and construction companies, semiconductor manufacturers and trucking companies. Interest-sensitive stocks like savings and loans had a miserable three months, as did airlines, oil and gas drillers and houseware manufacturers.
Rising auto sales, a clear sign of healthier economic times, worked wonders for Breed Technologies, the Big Board's best performer during the quarter. Breed, an air bag manufacturer, saw its share price rise nearly 114 percent in the quarter.
Many investors in emerging markets got roughed up, thanks to rising interest rates and political uncertainty. But people who had invested in two Hungarian telephone ventures were all smiles. Hungarian Teleconstruction was the best-performing stock in Nasdaq trading last quarter, rising by more than 240 percent. Shares of Hungarian Telephone, the other company, rose 88 percent.
In a quarter littered with losers, there were nevertheless some spectacular declines. On the Big Board, Pharmaceutical Resources saw its shares lose nearly half their value after price cuts hurt sales of its generic drugs. Two companies that lost big postal contracts in the first quarter, Electrocom Automation and U.S. Banknote, fared almost as badly.
Harvard International Technologies, a maker of french-fry vending machines, was the worst performer on the American Stock Exchange. The company, which said during the quarter that it might seek court protection from creditors, saw its shares fall by 66.7 percent.
Analysts are now nervous about the stock market's outlook for the second quarter, following yesterday's selloff in the Treasury market, which pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to a 14-month high of 7.26 percent.
Bond prices fell in response to an unexpectedly strong report on employment conditions in March. Trading was very thin, indicating that the selloff was exaggerated. The stock market had no reaction; it was closed in observance of Good Friday.
The March employment figures were the strongest since those for October 1987, the month of the stock market crash.
"The bond market was reacting to the fact that credit demand is alive and well," Mr. Shulman of Salomon Brothers said. For the stock market, he said, "that means Monday is not going to be a pretty day."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on U.S. Report Of Big Job Growth in March

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar jumped against most leading currencies yesterday as American interest rates surged after a Government report showing the largest growth in jobs in more than six years.
Traders started buying dollars after the Labor Department said the economy had added 456,000 new jobs in March, nearly twice the growth that some analysts had expected. 
 "This was an earth-shattering employment number," said Alfonso Alejo, senior proprietary trader at Sakura Bank Ltd. "The economy has gathered a lot of momentum, which could mean a turning point for the dollar.
The unemployment rate remained at 6.5 percent. But another Government report noted that personal income rose 1.3 percent and spending 1 percent in February, the largest gains for both figures since last April.
In New York, the dollar rose to 1.6970 German marks, from 1.6730 on Thursday.
It also rose to 103.60 Japanese yen, from 102.75. But for the week, the dollar has fallen by 1.21 yen.
Currency trading was thin and ended around midday because of Good Friday. Financial markets in London, the world's biggest foreign-exchange center, and elsewhere were closed.
Investors often buy dollars after reports of economic strength, betting that growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates to keep inflation under control.
Until yesterday's rally, the dollar had fallen almost 4 percent against the mark since Jan. 1, hurt by sinking stock and bond prices and concerns about the Whitewater affair. Stubbornly high German interest rates also weighed on the dollar.
The dollar began its rise against the yen in early Tokyo trading, after the Bank of Japan bought dollars, traders said. The central bank bought dollars throughout March in an effort to keep the yen from rising. A strong yen hurts Japan's manufacturers by making their products more expensive abroad.
The dollar has fallen almost 5 percent against the yen since American-Japanese trade talks collapsed on Feb. 11.
The Canadian dollar tumbled to a seven-year low of 71.97 United States cents amid persistent concerns about Canada's debt. The Federal Reserve bought Canadian dollars to try to stem the slide, traders said. The Fed was probably buying on behalf of the Bank of Canada, which was closed for Good Friday.
The British pound finished in New York at $1.4740, down from $1.4845.

HEADLINE: New York City Gained 92,000 Jobs Last Month

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Employment in New York City increased sharply in March, but was little changed in New York State and New Jersey, the Labor Department said yesterday.
The employment data for the region reflected a less vigorous rate of economic expansion than for the nation as a whole. Only in New York City, which gained 92,000 jobs, were the employment gains similar to the surge experienced nationally. The department said 456,000 jobs were added nationwide last month. 
 New York City's job gains accounted for more than the 81,000 jobs that the agency said were added for all of New York State, meaning employment dipped slightly in communities outside New York City. In New Jersey, there were 31,000 fewer jobs in March than in the previous month.
 
Jobless Survey Is Changed
 The Labor Department said its method of figuring the unemployment rate -- which has always been a different measure of economic activity -- was changed last month. As a result, the agency said unemployment rates were higher throughout the region.
In New York City, which for years has had higher unemployment rates than the rest of the region, the jobless rate rose to 10.3 percent in March, from 10 percent in February, the agency said. In New York State, the rate rose to 8.1 percent, from 7.8 percent in February. In New Jersey, the rate rose to 7.9 percent, from 7.3 percent.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said yesterday that the increase in the actual number of jobs in New York City had brought employment in the city back to about the January level. The decline in February was due in part to the winter storms, he said.
 The employment data released yesterday covered only the largest industrial states, as is the case at the beginning of each month. March data for Connecticut were not included.
 
New Questionnaire
 Mr. Ehrenhalt said the Federal agency's method of calculating unemployment rates, which relies on a survey of households, was changed to include a new questionnaire and greater use of computers to analyze the results.
Because the unemployment rate is a measure of the part of the population that was not only out of work, but looking for jobs, Mr. Ehrenhalt said the changes were intended to provide a more accurate count of those who had been seeking work.
The new method identifies more women, teen-agers and people older than 65 who had made some effort to find jobs, and who might not have been counted in the past. It therefore tends to show a higher overall unemployment rate than was indicated under the previous method.

HEADLINE: Giuliani And Rangel Strike a Deal On U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Congressman Charles B. Rangel said yesterday that they had reached an agreement on the boundaries of a Federal inner-city development program that has become the focus of a bitter political tug-of-war.
The program, the Government's largest inner-city development effort in a decade, is expected to bring $100 million in Federal money for job training, drug treatment and other social services to parts of the city. In recent weeks, Mr. Rangel and the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, have been battling over whether the money would go to the Bronx or Harlem. 
 According to the compromise, the money would benefit both.
 
Discussed With the Governor
 The Mayor said he had reached a compromise with Mr. Rangel during a private meeting early yesterday morning and later had discussed the deal with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who must also agree before a plan is presented to officials in Washington. Mr. Giuliani said the Governor had expressed preliminary support of the plan and a final announcement of the details would come next week.
"Between ourselves, we reached a final agreement," Mr. Giuliani said. "There are a few other people to discuss it with."
The heart of the compromise is an agreement to extend the area covered by the development program into the South Bronx in order that Yankee Stadium and other industrial tracts along the Harlem River can take advantage of special tax incentives, aides to the Mayor and the Congressman said. The plan might allow the New York Yankees and businesses near the stadium to take advantage of special tax exempt bonds and tax credits in return for employing local residents.
By including Yankee Stadium in the compromise, Mr. Giuliani was able to appeal to another constituent, George Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees, who has urged the city to improve conditions around the stadium and who has hinted that he would consider moving the team elsewhere.
 
Harlem as 'a Magnet'
 Mr. Giuliani said the Governor had expressed support for the compromise. He said the plan would "continue to solidify Harlem as a magnet" while allowing the city "to use some of the benefits that emerge from this legislation that the Congressman has been so instrumental in getting through Congress to help areas of the South Bronx."
Mr. Rangel said he had agreed to include Yankee Stadium and industrial areas in the Bronx in exchange for the administration's support for the neighborhood in his district originally proposed by former Mayor David N. Dinkins: Central Harlem, East Harlem and Washington Heights.
"I thought the Yankees would be something that everyone would love," Mr. Rangel said. "This would be very, very important to the Mayor."
Officials declined to specify exactly where the boundaries would be, saying those would be announced next week.
Thomas Conroy, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, confirmed that the Governor supported the compromise as it was outlined for him by the Mayor.
Under President Clinton's empowerment zone program, the Mayor and the Governor must jointly nominate up to three separate sections of the city to receive the Federal money.
 
Makings of a Feud
 Mr. Dinkins, in one of his last acts as Mayor, designated Harlem and Washington Heights as the city's sole choice for the program. The designation was a favor to the Mayor's political ally, Mr. Rangel, a ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee who fought to include the legislation in the President's budget last summer.
But Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, scotched the Dinkins plan after winning the November election, saying other neighborhoods, like the South Bronx and parts of Brooklyn, were just as deserving. There followed a political feud that threatened to jeopardize the application, pitting Mr. Rangel, the city's senior black politician, against Mr. Ferrer.
Aides to the Mayor said the compromise reached yesterday will still leave most of the zone within Harlem, although it would stretch to the north to take in many industrial sections of the southern Bronx, including the area around Yankee Stadium.
The applications are due in Washington by the end of June, and Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is expected to make a decision by late summer. Because Mr. Rangel sponsored the legislation, officials take it for granted that New York will be one of the six urban zones chosen for the program.

HEADLINE: Budget Assumptions;
Whitman's Planners Base Projections On Lower Pension and Health Costs

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
When Christine Todd Whitman presented her budget for New Jersey last month, she seemed to be getting something for nothing.
Committed to financing a $549 million personal income tax cut on top of a looming $2 billion gap between projected outlays and revenues, the Governor outlined a plan that promised remarkably little pain. How was that possible? 
 Mrs. Whitman's experts say they discovered that New Jersey was saving far more money for employee pensions and health care costs than it really had to. Not surprisingly, they decided to tap those funds rather than to hack away at state programs or retreat from Mrs. Whitman's pledge.
Behind the arcane budget language, the issue turns on nothing more complicated than an effort to set aside less money now to pay the pension and health care costs for the state's retirees, both present and future. The budget would also tap surpluses built up in a variety of special state funds. Together, these savings add up to almost $1.5 billion, or more than half the amount needed to bridge the budget gap for 1994 and the first half of 1995.
Mrs. Whitman's budget alarmed the unions that represent state and local government employees. They charge that putting aside less for the pensions they will eventually collect -- and nothing at all for the health care they will eventually need -- must inevitably cost the state much more tomorrow. (The Whitman plan would pay retirees' medical bills only as they actually come in.)
Everything the Governor has proposed awaits legislative action.
"They can balance the budget any way they please as long as they don't balance it on our backs," Robert Yackel, chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s public employee committee, said at a news conference on Monday.
Charles H. Marciante, president of the New Jersey branch of the labor federation, warned of job actions if the measures are not changed. "No one looks for confrontation," he said, "but we're not shying away from it."
The issue, however, is far from clear. Independent experts say that the Whitman team may be testing the limits of proper action, but that it does not appear to have crossed the line.
 
'The Far End of the Range'
 "I wouldn't characterize the pension proposals as gimmicks," said Howard Young, a professor of actuarial science at the University of Michigan. "They're within the range of acceptable measures, though you'd have to say it's at the far end of the range."
The Governor's budget people stoutly defend their plan as legitimate and quite unlike the outright postponements of pension payments that past governments have sometimes chosen. But even they acknowledge that their proposals are not so cautious as current practice. The actions are justified nevertheless, they argue, because other choices would have been worse.
"We're very sensitive to the pain caused by layoffs," said Arthur J. Maurice of the New Jersey State Treasurer's office. "We looked at everything under the sun, and relative to other changes, these were the least painful ways to achieve our goals."
To some extent, New Jersey may simply be postponing painful choices. Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating agency, stated recently that Mrs. Whitman's budget continues a pattern of stop-gap measures the state has adopted in the last few years.
State budget officials concede that they are relying on $827 million in one-time savings, but said that last year New Jersey depended on $1.5 billion in similar measures. By postponing the day of reckoning, the "one shots" can push today's problems into tomorrow. But they also give New Jersey politicians more time to work out less onerous ways to reduce state spending.
Doubts remain on Wall Street, though. "Professional actuaries may find both the state's current process, as well as the proposed revisions, acceptable," wrote Hyman C. Grossman, a managing director at Standard & Poor's. Still, he added, "there is some degree of risk for the longer term beyond 2000." Without stronger economic growth, Mr. Grossman suggested, New Jersey taxpayers could end up mortgaging a portion of their children's future.
But the state is chalking up genuine gains as well.
The relentless rise in health care bills, for example, has slowed dramatically in the last two years, making it likely that future costs will be lower than expected. Rates that health insurers charge for New Jersey employee health care expenses will fall by 5 percent next year.
Consequently, Mrs. Whitman's experts no longer assume that health care costs will rise at 12 percent a year, as Gov. Jim Florio's last budget did. Instead, their figures project that the rise in medical costs will slow from 8 percent in 1993 to 6 percent by the late 1990's. While health care inflation has clearly diminished, not all experts are convinced that pattern will continue, particularly if there is no Federal overhaul of the health care system.
The reduction in costs for employees' health care and the return to a "pay as you go" system for retirees' health costs, a method used until two years ago, are expected to save $268 million this year, $341 million in fiscal 1995 and $376 million in 1996. Most states, as well as nearly all private companies, rely on "pay as you go" to finance retirees' health care costs.
But the unions for public employees want to keep the advance financing even if it is more costly. They do not want the retirees' health care to depend on a fresh legislative decision every year.
"We're afraid that health care would end up as simply a pawn in the annual appropriation process," said Karen Joseph of the New Jersey Education Association.
 
Supplemental Payment
 Most disturbing to state employees is Mrs. Whitman's plan to drop a supplemental payment that dates from the 1950's and 60's. The state started a system of reducing its pension payments to retirees who also received Social Security. To make up for those reductions, Trenton agreed to pay a portion of its employees' pension contributions. New Jersey is the only state to continue the practice after the reduction of pensions was stopped in 1966.
"It's unfair to ask taxpayers to keep paying for a program that should have ended in 1966," said Brian W. Clymer, the State Treasurer.
That is little comfort to state workers. A public employee earning $50,000 would pay $1,000 a year more toward retirement. After taxes, that would mean about $650 less in take-home pay.
The Governor's aides note that workers outside government, many of whom lost their jobs in the long recession, have had to absorb much greater blows.
"Everybody is having to learn to do more with less," said Alan J. Bowers, a Whitman adviser and managing partner for New Jersey for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand. "The underlying philosophy behind many of these changes is that we're trying to put the state government on a more businesslike basis."
Topping that list is a shift in the treatment of pensions that, together with smaller changes, would reduce the state's contribution from $602 million this year to $243.2 million. And those savings would continue. State spending on pensions would be only $479.7 million in fiscal 1998, compared with $1.36 billion if the current practice remains unchanged.
New Jersey, like most governments, now tries to smooth the state's contributions to pension programs over an employee's working life, just as some homeowners choose to avoid seasonal peaks by averaging their fuel bills over an entire year. In an employee's early years, the state's payments are higher than necessary to finance a pension based on his salary, but as he nears retirement the payments are lower.
The proposed method, which is followed by most corporations and by a growing number of states, increases payments in step with salary increases as an employee nears retirement.
As long as the average age of the state's work force stays about the same, its pension contributions will remain steady as a share of total payroll costs. But if normal employee turnover were to diminish and the average age of the state's workers rose sharply, its required pension contributions would rise dramatically as well.
"It's something like the difference between term and whole life insurance," said John Mackin, a senior vice president at the Segal Company, a leading employee benefit consulting business based in New York. "You can't say one is better or worse than the other. They are both legitimate, equally effective, ways of budgeting for future retirement system costs."

HEADLINE: Company News: New Career in Consulting;
Bilzerian, Once a Raider, Now Rides to the Rescue

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
A small Utah company is seeking help from an unlikely patron: Paul A. Bilzerian, the former corporate raider.
Mr. Bilzerian has been hired as a management consultant by Cimetrix Inc., an Orem, Utah, company that says it has software marketing contracts with I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. Under his contract, Mr. Bilzerian received an option to buy 20 percent of Cimetrix stock for $1 million. He also received the right to vote an additional 50.4 percent of the shares for three years on some issues, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. 
 "I am very impressed with the person," the president of Cimetrix, Lincoln Daftrup, said of Mr. Bilzerian. "He has a wonderful track record; he is a genius, and he has a Harvard M.B.A."
He also has a prison record.
Mr. Bilzerian was convicted of violating Federal securities laws a year after he won the Singer Company in a $1.06 billion hostile takeover in 1988. He served 20 months in prison.
Mr. Bilzerian could not be reached for comment yesterday. His lawyer, Arthur Mathews of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, said he was not sure what Mr. Bilzerian had been doing since he left prison. "To the best I know," Mr. Mathews said, "he lives in Tampa and he has been spending all of his time litigating various issues in his bankruptcy."
None of this appears to have fazed Cimetrix. Its contract with Mr. Bilzerian says, "Whereas Bilzerian has experience and expertise in the purchase, sale, financing and management of various businesses, Cimetrix desires to employ Bilzerian as a management consultant to advise and assist Cimetrix in resolving its current financial crisis."
The company, which until recently had software products only in the development stage, has been posting losses.
"We are just ready now to hit the market with a finished product," Mr. Daftrup said. Cimetrix hired Mr. Bilzerian "to come into the company and give us the kind of management that we need."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
In El Paso, a Reluctance To Buy Mexican Shares

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson 

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
WHEN David J. Lemaster, the manager of the Dean Witter office here, suggests that his clients get their feet wet in foreign markets, they could act on his advice by walking about 10 minutes south, the Rio Grande border patrol permitting. But many in El Paso, having already invested in their own Mexican business ventures, are reluctant to place their savings on the same bet.
"Maybe because we've lived with some of the problems Mexico has experienced over the last 20 or 30 years," Mr. Lemaster said with the calm, slow emphasis of one who's seen it all, "we might be more skeptical." 
 El Pasoans may be in the vanguard of international business dealings, but they are resolutely cautious in buying international securities. United States investors who piled into foreign markets last year, especially emerging markets, and have watched these markets retreat this year, might well listen to business people who can survey a foreign market with a glance outside their windows.
Albert Beckman, an exporter of promotional merchandise whose office entrance looks across the border over Ciudad Juarez, talks not about Telmex, Cifra or other Mexican stocks. He wants to show off the caps, postcards, T-shirts, mugs, keychains and refrigerator magnets, emblazoned with sports or product logos, that he is shipping to the south.
Having pursued a variety of cross-border businesses for 14 years, surviving the bridge blockades set up by the opposition party that governs the state of Chihuahua, he merely shrugs at the latest political unrest.
After rising 48.5 percent in dollars last year, the Mexican market has slipped 14.5 percent this year, buffeted by the uprising in Chiapas, a recession and the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the governing party's presidential candidate. Most Mexican stocks are down to levels last seen before the North American Free Trade Agreement was passed in November.
Although Mr. Beckman muses about the profits he could have made from buying stock in Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, a couple years ago, he had other things to do. "I was too busy running my business," he said. Besides, at age 56, he is in no mood to take risks with his savings, putting only about 10 percent in a Dean Witter global mutual fund.
Mr. LeMaster, his broker, advises clients to invest in foreign markets, but to limit their holdings to 20 or 25 percent of their money, with just a fraction of it in emerging markets. He usually directs them toward well-diversified mutual funds. His firm also recommends a few Mexican stocks, but only those with American depository receipts traded in dollars on United States exchanges.
Mr. Lemaster stands ready to make the case for emerging markets more generally, however. A binder of charts displayed on his desk was opened to a page showing that the real gross domestic products of emerging markets grew by 4.5, 4.7 and again 4.7 percent in 1990, 1991 and 1992, compared with 2.2, 0.3 and 0.9 percent in those years for the three largest markets, the United States, Japan and Britain. Last year, funds that invest in the developing nations of Asia and Latin America gained a third, a half, sometimes more.
But even a diversified fund can't always compensate for the volatility of these markets, as well as the currency risks. Michael Miles, executive vice president of his family's El Paso-based customs brokerage firm, which aids shippers, believes the peso is still 30 or 40 percent overvalued.
Although he has put a small portion of his savings in a European mutual fund, when it comes to Mexico he prefers to find partnerships or start new businesses, where he has control.
"If I'm going to be an investor, I'm going to be a full-time investor," he said. "Otherwise, you're just rolling the dice."
The current global trend may be toward lower trade and investment barrier, but some in El Paso remember when the winds sweeping through their high desert valley seemed to be blowing the other way. In the early 1980's, many deposited their money in Mexican banks, earning rates of interest surpassing 20 percent. But then the Government nationalized the banks, making it difficult for foreign investors even to get their money back. "Those memories aren't completely out of everyone's mind," Mr. Lemaster said.
One of the few El Pasoans who feel they can pick Mexican stocks like a pro, in fact, manages money for a living. David Austin, whose duties at El Paso Natural Gas include running a $450 million pension fund, has put about a quarter of that into foreign stocks and bonds, and about 3 percent of the total in emerging markets.
Mr. Austin's company is a partner in building a gas-fired power plant south of Ciudad Juarez, with a gas pipeline to Mexico also in the works. And he has put more than 20 percent of his personal portfolio into the United States shares of Cifra, a Mexican retailer, and Vitro, a glass maker.
Mr. Austin's broker, Ruben E. Guerra of Smith Barney Shearson, has gotten dozens of calls recently from clients on both sides of the border who worry about the Mexican market after the assassination.
But Mr. Austin said that the market's resilience after such tragedies proves that the nation's economy has fundamentally changed, with rewards to the patient. "I don't expect to make money overnight," he said.
More El Paso investors, however, are busier figuring out what they can sell across the river, or what the Mexicans can make most efficiently and ship back. Then, whatever earnings they don't plow back into their businesses go into the sorts of diversified portfolios that would make good sense anywhere.

HEADLINE: Records Show Mrs. Clinton Took Big Risks in Trades

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton apparently took huge risks to earn profits in the early phase of her commodities trading, an analysis of her trading records indicates. She made purchases that had to be sold the same day because she would probably have been unable to put up the money required by the commodity exchange to allow her to hold the investments overnight.
The White House disclosed this week that beginning in October 1979 she made a $100,000 profit over 10 months of commodities trading, after starting with a $1,000 investment. 
 Her first commodities trade, on Oct. 12, 1978, produced a profit of $5,300 for a day trade -- a transaction in which the investment was opened and closed on the same day. Tables printed in newspapers show that Oct. 12 was a relatively peaceful day on the commodities markets, and to make that much money would have required the purchase of at least 12 cattle futures contracts.
At the time, the minimum amount that a customer had to post to deal in cattle futures, as set by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, was $1,200 a contract. That means the amount, called the margin, required on 12 such contracts would have been $14,400, far more than the $1,000 Mrs. Clinton had deposited in her account. The posting of margin is to protect the brokerage if the market goes against the investor.
 
Substantial Risk for Clintons
 At that time, such an amount would have been a substantial one for the Clintons. In 1978, Mr. Clinton earned $26,500 as Arkansas Attorney General, and Mrs. Clinton's received a salary of $24,250 from her law firm, according to the tax returns made public by the White House.
As a practical matter, commodity exchanges do not require brokerage firms to put up the margin money for their accounts until the close of trading, and so day-trading, as Mrs. Clinton engaged, does not make the actual exchange of cash necessary. But such trading is inherently risky, because it means the investment must be liquidated the same day, whether or not the market has moved in the expected direction.
Had the market gone against her that first day, Mrs. Clinton could easily have lost $5,000 or more, far more than the $1,000 in her account. Many brokerages would be reluctant to allow such trading from an account with so little cash in it, and the willingness of her brokers to allow it at least raises the possibility of preferential treatment.
The fact that she had substantial losses on some trades in November indicates that her trades were genuine and that, as the White House has said, she was risking her own money.
In trading commodities, a speculator enters into a contract promising to buy a given amount of the commodity -- 42,000 pounds of cattle, for example -- or to sell it on a certain date in the future. Such a contract is traded and retraded for months before its actual expiration date.
The trading records made public this week by the White House do not show what Mrs. Clinton bought and sold in her day trades. Instead, they show only the profit or loss on each trade. The White House said she traded mostly cattle futures, which were then falling because of concerns about more cattle coming to market.
In cattle, for example, the largest daily move then was 1.1 cents a pound, in the January 1979 contract for feeder cattle. Each contract covers 42,000 pounds of beef, so a lucky trader who sold a contract early in the day, at the day's high price of 71.2 cents a pound, and bought it back later at the day's low of 70.1 cents a pound, would have made a profit of $462 before commissions.
To make $5,300, a purchase of at least 12 contracts would have been needed -- more if Mrs. Clinton did not have the good fortune to buy at the exact bottom and sell at the exact top.
The White House said she had also traded in lumber, soybeans, hogs, sugar and copper in the years she was active in the commodities market. Of those, only soybeans was especially volatile on the first day of her trading, records show. Had she traded soybeans, it is conceivable that she could have traded as few as four contracts. But the initial margin on those contracts, was $2,250 a contract, meaning the minimum margin had she held such a position overnight would have been $9,000.
 
First 3 Trades
 Mrs. Clinton's first three day trades, in October 1978, were profitable, but in November she lost on three of the five trades for the month. The last of those losses, on Nov. 22, produced a loss of $17,400, which almost decimated her account. It was left with a balance of just $1,401, although Mrs. Clinton had earlier taken out $5,000 in profits.
The Nov. 22 trade came on the day before Thanksgiving, a day that often produces sluggish markets. That year was no exception. The biggest swing in cattle was again 1.1 cents a contract, for a maximum possible loss of $462 on a contract. The largest swing among any of the commodities in which the White House said she traded was in lumber futures for January 1979, where the prices ranged from $196.20 to $202 for 1,000 board feet of lumber.
With each lumber contract controlling 100,000 board feet, she would have needed to trade at least 30 contracts to lose that much. And had she held that many contracts overnight, the minimum margin would have been $27,000, at $900 a contract.
 
3 Profitable Trades
 In December, Mrs. Clinton had three day trades, all profitable, and at the end of the year she was able to withdraw another $15,000 in cash from her account. She made another profitable day trade in January 1979, leaving her with enough cash in her account to make her first trade that was held at least overnight. In that trade, she bought 14 April 1979 cattle futures contracts on Jan. 26. By then, her accumulated profits were enough to cover the needed margin. She sold them in late February, making a profit of about $19,000.
The late 1970's were a time of rising commodity prices as inflation accelerated. But one of Mrs. Clinton's boldest, and most profitable moves, came in the summer of 1979, when she sold 65 cattle contracts, betting that the price would decline. It did, and she made almost $25,000.
Until she stopped trading in 1980, Mrs. Clinton made a profit of almost $100,000, the White House has said.

HEADLINE: Mayor Derides Cortines's School Cutbacks as Inadequate

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
A day after New York City Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines offered a new plan to cut costs at the Board of Education, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani derided the proposal, saying it did not attack the board's "bloated overhead" with sufficient vigor.
Aides to Mr. Cortines, meeting yesterday to formulate responses to the Mayor's vehement remarks, said they were searching for new cost-cutting measures that would allow them to comply fully with Mr. Giuliani's request for a $332 million decrease in the board's $7.5 billion budget. But they repeated their contention that few additional reductions beyond cutting about 700 jobs and eliminating 500 vacant posts could be made at the board's central headquarters organization without throwing schools into chaos. 
 The central board administration has 6,300 full-time positions, and Mayor Giuliani has asked for a cut of 2,500 positions.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Cortines have been at odds since February, as the Mayor has sought to cut school spending to help close a $2.3 billion gap in the city's budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
 
Compromises Obscured
 And in a day of new skirmishes in the war over the school budget, two members of the central board also waded into the debate. Michael J. Petrides, the Staten Island representative who last fall both helped to hire Mr. Cortines and to elect Mr. Giuliani, said that the angry public outcry has obscured budget compromises emerging behind the scenes. And Dennis Walcott, appointed to the board by former Mayor David N. Dinkins, said he would fight plans announced by Mr. Cortines on Thursday to reduce the free-lunch program and to eliminate school bus services for sixth-grade students.
Mr. Giuliani fired the first volley in a morning television interview.
"There's no question that he can do better than that," Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Cortines's board reorganization plan. "And we're going to have to work with him to try and see if we can focus on that overhead -- the very famous, well-known, bloated overhead at the Board of Education."
"Maybe this is a day I'm particularly frustrated," he continued later on a radio talk show. "I've asked the Chancellor to find 2,500 positions in a school system bloated with administrators.
"Give me a break, you can find that in the system," he said.
And at a City Hall news conference, Mr. Giuliani said that what Mr. Cortines had done with his latest proposal was "kind of slide back" from earlier promises to cut 1,000 board employees.
After all that, Mr. Giuliani said: "I think my relationship with the Chancellor is a good relationship."
 
'A Misunderstanding'
 Mr. Cortines's plan, presented to reporters Thursday, promised to cut 678 of the 6,300 full-time positions at the board's central headquarters and to eliminate 513 unfilled jobs by July 1995, for a total cut of 1,191 positions. "The Mayor's reaction has been born of a misunderstanding, as angry reactions often are," said John. H. Beckman, Mr. Cortines's spokesman. "What we presented yesterday was only a part of the budget proposal, not the budget proposal."
The reductions in central staffing and in busing and lunch services outlined in the board plan released Thursday offered savings of $76 million, far short of the $332 million Mr. Giuliani has demanded. But Mr. Cortines intends to release another proposal next week that will outline a strategy for cutting the full $332 million, the board's budget director, Leonard Hellenbrand, said yesterday.
"We are developing plans to meet our responsibilities," Mr. Hellenbrand said. "People may not like the way we do it -- we may not like it -- but if we are responsible for absorbing a cut, we will make a cut."
 
No Details Given
 He declined to detail the strategy, but he said most of the remaining savings will not come through further reductions in the headquarters staff.
"We've said from the beginning that you can't make a 2,500 person cut" at board headquarters, he said. "That's not doable unless one believes that there are hundreds and hundreds of people just twiddling their thumbs -- and that's not the case."
Mr. Petrides expressed concern that the dispute between the Mayor and the Chancellor could obstruct recent progress in the budget negotiations.
"The Mayor is into head count, and the Chancellor is into partially meeting that head count, and is exploring other options," Mr. Petrides said. "And I think that there will be closure at a certain point."
"But today I'm concerned," Mr. Petrides said. "I hope that people are talking."
Lost in the battle have been the magnitude of the cuts Mr. Cortines has promised so far. Nearly 700 employees, many of them professionals, are to be dismissed by July, and some have already begun receiving informal notifications. One school official said a dismayed professional who has worked at the board for 17 years called her yesterday, distraught about the prospect of circulating her resume in a bleak economy.
"And we're going to get more calls like that," the school official said.

HEADLINE: A Latin Strategy for Spain's Telephone Company

BYLINE: By ANA WESTLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADRID, April 1

 BODY:
Barely three years ago, Spain's giant telephone monopoly looked like another corporate dinosaur facing extinction, as inevitable competition imposed by the European Union loomed in 2003.
Instead, Telefonica de Espana took a modest international subsidiary that once sold hardware, injected it with $824 million in capital and built it into a major player in the international communications world. The subsidiary, Telefonica Internacional, has been snapping up Latin American acquisitions as soon as they come up on the privatization block and transforming them from chaos to profit-generating enterprises. 
 Telefonica has put two Spanish executives educated in the United States in charge of the unit, and has beaten American companies for deals in their own geographical backyard. Telefonica's stock, capitalized at $13 billion as of Jan. 31, is quoted on stock exchanges in New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo, as well as Madrid.
 
'Best Ditch-Digging Technology'
 Telefonica has succeeded by tapping its experience building telephone systems at home practically from scratch and by backing them up with heavy investment. It has also benefitted from Spain's linguistic and cultural ties to Latin America.
"We have the best ditch-digging technology around," said Inaki Santillana, Telefonica Internacional's chief executive and the architect behind its international expansion. "When it comes to installing a million access lines in record time, no one can beat us."
What Mr. Santillana described as technology is really an operating strategy: buying the latest equipment in bulk, installing new networks at top speed and overhauling old ones, using teams of Spanish technicians sent in like shock troops.
Last month, Telefonica bid a record $2 billion for 35 percent of Peru's telephone companies, Compania Peruana de Telefonos and Entel Peru, to consolidate its leadership position in South American telecommunications. The successful bid, the largest made by any Spanish company for any acquisition, was more than double that of its closest rivals for the deal, Southwestern Bell and GTE.
Telefonica Internacional now owns stakes in Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Columbia, Uruguay and Puerto Rico, in addition to ventures in Portugal and Romania. Telefonica itself has become Spain's largest company by sales, accounting for 1.8 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
Telefonica Internacional is also discussing market-sharing alliances with two or three leading American phone companies, which Mr. Santillana would not identify. The company broke into the American market last year when it bought 80 percent of Puerto Rico's long-distance company, Telefonica Larga Distancia.
Telefonica has come a long way since 1990, when its international unit lost 800 million pesetas, then worth more than $8.25 million, in operations limited to peddling its hardware at international trade fairs. Today, the subsidiary is a leading Spanish multinational on its own, with assets that have more than quintupled initial acquisition costs, to 645.6 billion pesetas, or $4.5 billion.
Last year Telefonica Internacional's net profits surged 127 percent to reach 21.3 billion pesetas, about $150 million. In dollar terms, this increase was 83 percent, taking into account several devaluations of the peseta. Net profits for the Telefonica group rose 17.7 percent last year to 95.079 billion pesetas, about $670 million.
Telefonica, the parent company, developed its skills by laying new access lines in Spain at a rate of a million lines a year for the last five years. Telefonica had to deal with hundreds of thousands of irate potential customers who waited months, or sometimes years, for a simple telephone.
By the end of 1993, Telefonica had wiped out waiting lists and had modernized much of Spain's telecommunication infrastructure, replacing old networks with digital and fiber optic systems. Spain now has 15 million telephones for a population of 40 million. Along the way, the company improved its once disastrous reputation for both local and international phone service. International calls remain the most expensive in Europe.
Telefonica Internacional was transformed from a sleepy international sales company into a modern telecommunications competitor, with an initial outlay in 1990 of 79.9 billion pesetas, then worth about $824 million.
Mr. Santillana, a 45-year-old economist who holds a doctorate from Indiana University, was brought in from the parent company's financial planning department. Francisco Ros, a 43-year-old telecommunications engineer with a doctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, headed Telefonica's technical team.
"We decided it was time to share not only language and culture, but also business," said Candido Velazquez, chairman of the Telefonica group, who predicted "wonderful opportunities" in Latin America.
 
Tough Case in Argentina
 What Mr. Velazquez called "wonderful" was enough to scare off United States rivals. Telefonica's first plunge came in 1990 with the purchase of nearly 20 percent of Telefonica de Argentina, as well as management control, for $415.7 million. The company covers the southern half of the country, including the financial district of southern Buenos Aires.
"It looked like a total disaster," Mr. Santillana recalled. Some employees were rerouting company lines and pocketing the charges. Pirating of telephone lines flourished. Some residents shared phones by stringing their own wires from window to window. Lack of maintenance left many networks inoperable. Equipment, bought years earlier, sat in warehouses unopened. And some veterans of the Falklands war with Britain drew their pensions in the form of telephone company salaries.
"Despite the chaos, we realized this was something we could handle," Mr. Ros said. "They had the same technical problems we had five years earlier, only worse."
American companies were installing 30,000 to 40,000 lines a year, of which most were replacements, not new access lines, Mr. Ros said. "There are not many international companies that have the capacity or experience to deal with huge magnitudes in short periods," he said.
"We sent in our own technical lightning brigades and in two years and one million lines later we were making money," Mr. Santillana said. As a result, the Argentine company Telefonica de Argentina S.A., or TASA, had net profits of $301 million in 1993.
Although Argentina was one of the worst cases, Telefonica had similar experiences in other countries like Chile and Venezuela. The bid in Peru for 35 percent of CPT and Entel Peru has been its most controversial purchase, partly because it involved a country considered in the backwaters of the communications world.
In the face of criticism in the Spanish press that the bid was excessive, Mr. Velazquez, the Telefonica chairman, told a parliamentary commission that the $2 billion cost "was no scandal" and promised the company "will make lots of money." The Spanish Government owns about a 30 percent stake in the telephone company.
S. G. Warburg Securities in Madrid noted in its analysis that Telefonica was paying for tremendous future growth potential and termed the bids by Southwestern Bell and GTE of $857 million and $803 million, respectively, as "unrealistically low."
"For us it was an important piece of the puzzle," Mr. Santillana said, "one of the last major privatizations for a while, and fills out our network." With the acquisition, Telefonica now serves a population of 110 million people in Latin America, in addition to 40 million Spaniards.
 
Criticized at Home
 While preaching the virtues of privatization internationally, Telefonica has not yet outlived its reputation for monopolistic abuses at home in Spain, where memories of waiting lists and surly operators die hard.
Some analysts feel Telefonica should concentrate more on trimming its work force of 74,000 employees at home and become more efficient when the Spanish market soon opens to outside competition. The European Union has declared all member nations must open their phone systems to competition by 2003. The Spanish Government has set a goal of doing so by 1998.
 Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, president of the Tribunal of Competition, a governmental regulatory agency, has accused Telefonica of dragging its feet of preparing for liberalization. "Telfonica's monopolistic high rates have a negative effect on Spanish business, making them less competitive," he said.
Alberto Martinez, a Telefonica spokesman, rebutted that by saying: "Our hands are tied. The Government has to authorize price changes." He said that the Transportation Ministry justified Telefonica's income from high prices because it must be used to subsidize phone service in rural areas.

HEADLINE: Growing Up A Haldeman

BYLINE: By Peter Haldeman;. 
Peter Haldeman, a contributing editor of Travel and Leisure, lives in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
The turbulent Washington waters have claimed many public figures over the years, but few as powerful as Harry Robbins (Bob) Haldeman. Chief of staff to Richard Nixon, Haldeman served from the President's election until April 30, 1973, when he, along with his college friend John Ehrlichman and other top Nixon appointees, resigned amid mounting accusations of efforts to cover up the political scandal that began with the break-in of the Democratic national headquarters at the Watergate complex.
 H. R. Haldeman, a successful Los Angeles advertising executive, worked for the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket in 1956. Looking, he said, for an adventure beyond advertising, he was drawn to Nixon by opportunity as well as ideology -- both he and Nixon were active in California business circles. But he also admired Nixon's "fighting" spirit. Haldeman served as Nixon's chief advance man in his race against John F. Kennedy in 1960, as manager of Nixon's 1962 gubernatorial bid and as manager again of Nixon's triumphant 1968 Presidential campaign.
 Such was the power he came to wield as White House chief of staff that Haldeman became known as "Nixon's S.O.B." and the "Iron Chancellor." His fall was as steep as his rise. Haldeman was tried and convicted, in January 1975, on charges of perjury, conspiracy and obstruction of justice for his part in the cover-up. He served 18 months in prison. 
 In his 1978 book "The Ends of Power," Haldeman asserted that Nixon -- who resigned from the Presidency on Aug. 9, 1974 -- had "initiated the Watergate break-in." Yet he also acknowledged that in his job as chief of staff he "put on too much pressure, and in the process laid the groundwork for the mental attitude that 'the job must be done,' which badly served the cause when Watergate struck."
 H. R. Haldeman died last November at the age of 67. He is survived by his wife, Joanne, and four children: Susan, Hank, Peter and Ann. He also left behind a journal of his White House years, which Putnam will publish this June. The following is a different remembrance of those same years, and some that followed. Written by Haldeman's son Peter, it is a demonstration that history is not selective in those it takes in its wake.
On my father's last birthday, two weeks before he died, my mother telephoned me from their home in Santa Barbara to say she was afraid I was ruining his chances for a recovery. She was referring to a call I had made the day before, to a woman we had known in Washington, named Jeanette McGuiness. Mrs. McGuiness was my father's practitioner, or Christian Science healer. Until I had contacted her, Mrs. McGuiness had been planning to fly from Washington to California for the weekend in order to, as a Christian Scientist might say, work with my father on his situation. A basic tenet of Christian Science is that to specify a physical problem is to empower it. For this reason, and because at his request no one had seen or spoken with my father since he had taken ill except my mother, who is also a Christian Scientist, the nature of his illness was unclear. From my mother's telephone reports, my brother and two sisters and I, who all live within driving distance of Santa Barbara, had gleaned only that he had been in bed for three weeks with stomach pain and was eating very little. We were instructed not to share this information with anyone.
 I had phoned Jeanette McGuiness to ask her to give my father a message. For whatever it was worth, I wanted him to know -- and her too -- that I hoped he would consider medical treatment at this point. Mrs. McGuiness informed me that, as his practitioner, her exclusive responsibility was to carry out my father's wishes. I asked her whether, as a compassionate human being, she would pass along the suggestion. She said she would not. I then told Mrs. McGuiness that if my father died I would hold her, as his practitioner, accountable. That evening she telephoned my mother to say she was growing uncomfortable with the idea of coming out.
 I know this is how she put it because I kept notes. Ever since my father had become sick, I'd been documenting my phone conversations with my mother. The news, almost always bad, at least seemed more real on paper. I have a manila envelope stuffed with scribblings on the order of: Not leaving bed now and Had water this A.M. Another note: Call Jeanette -- apologize. As it happened, Jeanette McGuiness overcame her discomfort and made the trip. And, for reasons that remain vague to me, a few days after she'd returned to Washington, the rest of us were allowed to see him too.
 To see him was, I think, the most anyone expected. I know the inability to do so is what prompted my call to Mrs. McGuiness. The first night we were in Santa Barbara, my brother, Hank, gave my father a shave. I sat on the edge of his bed and found myself offering a morbid and inopportune account of the Malibu fires I'd seen on the drive up from Los Angeles. The whine of the blender drifted up from the kitchen, where my mother prepared flavored ice shavings, the only thing he could get down.
 The next day, he asked for fruit. I spent an hour in a Goleta health food store loading up on out-of-season strawberries and raspberries, packets of Emergen-C, apple juice. My brother logged onto the computer in my father's office to go over his bills. My older sister, Susan, arrived and went through the mail. A Christian Science night nurse came to spell my mother, who stayed up anyway. Within another few days, my younger sister, Ann, had shown up, and we'd settled into the not-unfamiliar rhythms of the family catastrophe. Returning inquisitive messages on the answering machine, taking care as advised not to "raise any red flags," I experienced again the comforts and the anxieties peculiar to our brand of collusion. I knew I was no longer ruining it for him, but I also knew I wasn't saving him.
 IN THE AFTERMATH OF MY FATHER'S DEATH, I've been working at sorting out the disruptions of death from those attributable to my father. I still get mail from people I don't know or don't remember. An old neighbor called -- the mother of a friend I haven't seen since elementary school. She wanted to tell me about the time she drove by the house and saw my father out on the front lawn playing the ukulele.
 I learned how to tune a uke from my father. Every Thursday, when his oxford shirts came back from the dry cleaners, he gave me the cardboard to draw on. At U.C.L.A. basketball games in Pauley Pavilion, he'd study the moves of Lew Alcindor and Lucius Allen while I, lulled by the cadence of sneakers on polyurethane, tried to keep my eyes off the clock. He signed the lines in my Cub Scout handbook certifying that I'd tied a slide knot, scaled an eight-foot wall, started a fire with a magnifying glass and paper. (My mother signed the rest.) The things we did together had the generic quality of the handbook's roughed illustrations. His efforts in this direction were earnest but sporadic. I tried too, but only when he did. I also used those shirt cardboards to make "Keep Out" signs for my bedroom door. One reason she'd never forgotten the sight of my father with a ukulele, said our old neighbor, was that it wasn't very often she saw him at all.
 The easiest way to identify the neighborhood is by contradistinction, which is largely how it identifies itself. It's not Hollywood. This is Los Angeles with a hard "g" -- as some of my grandparents persisted in pronouncing it -- a zone defined chiefly by tradition. Psychologically, it stretches back to the Midwest, where most of my great-grandparents had come from. Cultural totems include the now-defunct Bullocks tearoom, a box at the Hollywood Bowl and security by Pinkerton's. More often than not, we lived in Hancock Park, a lush enclave near downtown regarded by its inhabitants as a "less flashy" alternative to the West Side. The house I remember most vividly was a shingled Colonial with backyard features that I considered providential: a 60-foot pool, an avocado tree big enough to spend the night in and a badminton court that was better for roller-skating.
 For years, my father came home from work in the latest model Thunderbird convertible. The car was one of the perks of managing the Los Angeles branch of J. Walter Thompson, whose clients included Ford. He'd bring home account products like Shake-a-Puddin' or Superstuff -- inventions that, if you were a certain age, ranked with Fred MacMurray's discovery of flubber. Walt Disney was another client. Every Christmas, crates of complimentary Disney merchandise stood sentinel over the small city of other packages filling the living room. I don't remember any dinner-table speeches about it, but we were encouraged to believe that advantages like these were deserved, dividends of principle as much as effort. It was a tacit thing, like not going to the doctor. We were rewarded with root-beer floats for struggling with "Science and Health" at Sunday school; the center-court seats at Pauley Pavilion came our way because my father had raised most of the funds for the stadium. 
 And whenever we did homework, we were reminded of his most recent political crusade, a lost battle but one he had religiously spearheaded: a single rib of every pencil in the house read "Nixon for Governor."
 In the governor's residence in Sacramento, my mother took pictures of us dipping into Ronald Reagan's jellybean jar -- Jul 67, as the Kodachrome borders used to specify. My father had organized the trip, a driving tour of California. We chased grunion at Pismo Beach and drove the station wagon through hollowed-out sequoias and trooped through the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose. The president of the new U.C. Santa Cruz campus took us on a golf-cart junket past redwood groves and barefoot students in shawls dancing and blowing soap bubbles. A couple of them threw pebbles that ricocheted off the golf cart's thick tires. At night, we pulled into A.A.A.-endorsed motels, places with pool slides and souvenir shops. I avoided the shops. We'd been given small allowances, but I held onto mine meaningfully. I wanted to fall into line, wanted it to last like this -- us together, away. The farther up the coast we got, the more virtuous I felt. By the time we reached San Francisco, I had $7. At a novelty shop in Chinatown, eyeing something I was considering buying -- a rubber chicken -- thinking it was well within my means and this was what saving was all about, I realized I'd been pickpocketed.
 I used those shirt cardboards for "Keep Out" and "No Trespassing" notices, but I also made Nixon signs out of them. A few months after we returned from our California tour, my father was tapped to manage Richard Nixon's Presidential campaign. Like most of his involvements, this one chiefly meant we saw less of him. We wore campaign buttons to school with a vague smugness and ate dinner with my mother at the breakfast table. I attended a single campaign rally, in Santa Barbara -- an event I remember less well than the preparations for it. Ann and I got out of school early to spend the afternoon making signs in the driveway with my mother. I went through my cardboard collection writing, over and over in wobbly Magic Marker, Nixon's the One.
During the four and a half years he worked in Washington, at the urging of a Madison scholar, my father wrote or dictated daily diary entries pertaining to his job. I learned of his journal, along with his intention to have it published, several months before he died. No one except the young man he had enlisted to help him publish it knew anything about its contents or its length until after his death. The complete manuscript numbers 1,400 double-spaced typed pages. In an effort to determine how it might be reduced to a readable size, my mother, who inherited the rights to it, distributed portions to me and my sisters and brother to review. I received the 13th and 14th quarters -- 300 pages spanning January to June 1972. I'm not sure what I had in mind, but I found the material more absorbing than I'd expected. In part I think this is due to to the particular events documented -- the mining of Haiphong harbor, the Moscow summit, the first media tricklings concerning the Watergate break-in. But in some ways I found the narrative less interesting than the narration. The dedication my father brought to his job has not gone unremarked. For me, going over these pages felt something like examining the evidence of a love affair we'd only dimly apprehended -- by his absence, which was relatively brief, and his penance, which never really ended.
 The dinner-table announcement about the move to Washington focused more on what we were leaving than why: the house with the badminton court would have to be sold. My brother vowed he would buy it back someday. My designs were more immediate -- I saw myself exhaling wisps in a camel's-hair coat or a down parka with Velcro pockets. As it turned out, most of us spent only three winters in Washington; the first few hundred pages of my father's journal were composed in a hotel room somewhere near the White House while we finished the school term in California with my mother. In the fall of 1969, Susan started Stanford and Hank and Ann and I were sent to the Washington schools my mother had selected as carefully as the schemes for our bedrooms in Chevy Chase, Md.: a traditional boys' school for my brother, a traditional girls' school for my sister and Sidwell Friends for me.
 The Quaker faith is by definition an informal one, and Sidwell Friends casually articulated its Quaker affiliation. There were moments of silence before lunch and "meetings" instead of assemblies, and there was also an emphasis on causes usually identified as liberal -- volunteer programs in Anacostia, ecology drives, special awareness days for the women's movement and the peace movement. In 1970, the strong Quaker tradition of pacifism had yet to reach its fullest expression at Sidwell Friends, but one of my first official acts as a student there was to send away for a P.O.W. bracelet.
 At 13, my grasp of politics was still more intuitive than practical. I imagine this is the way most 13-year-olds perceive politics, but Washington 13-year-olds are not most 13-year-olds. I recall a girl in my class sidling up after a meeting to ask me whether it was true my father had snubbed the Secretary of the Interior. She wore knee socks and a hair band and belonged to a small tribe of students who wrote editorials invoking the moral majority. I said I didn't know, which was true. I knew enough. I knew (or had heard) Grace Slick planned to crash Tricia Nixon's wedding and spike the punch with LSD. I knew my father's zeal for his work had begun to earn him a few epithets -- Kremlin commissar, Nixon's son of a bitch. Cartoons depicting him with fangs or in Fascist regalia resurfaced on a wall in his office at home. A new fluttery thrill attended these notices, but I also recognized that he had been deemed fallible.
 Camp David was supposed to be our safehold. It was where he attempted to juggle his job and us and it was where, in Washington, most of my mental home movies are set. In a typical scene, we're bowling, taking turns hurling unmarked balls down a one-lane alley buffed glassy by Navy Seabees. Present or absent are the Ehrlichmans, the only family we did anything with in Washington. There's something funny and embarrassing about the monogrammed balls, their finger holes scaled to the various Nixons like little porridge bowls. We take care not to touch them. The phone in the wall rings. My father is saying, "Right-o," giving us the signal to evacuate because Julie and David want to bowl and are on their way over. Or he says, "Right-o," and changes his shoes and slips out the door.
 Another reel, 1970 or '71. A fall afternoon. We're loading the car in Chevy Chase, getting ready to meet my father at Camp David for the weekend. My mother leans against the trunk for a moment. "Wouldn't it be marvelous just to stay?" she asks. It's a rhetorical question, but wishful too: our neighbors are burning leaves and there's a football game at my brother's school. My father tried not to "bring home" his work; summits and bombings were not raised at the dinners and birthdays he still managed to fit in. But in Washington, the familiar rituals came to seem a little smaller and duller to me, like old rooms. In some ways, the big absences were the easy ones. What was missing could be so slight I wasn't always sure what it was. I'd say now it falls under the category of footballs not tossed, summits not discussed.
 That spring, after 17 years underground, several million cicadas shed their skins, climbed virtually every tree in the city, snapped their thorax membranes like drum heads and, one week later, died. The problems posed by their carcasses created many first-time callers to an agency known as the "complaint center," where my mother volunteered answering phones. My sister locked herself in her room with her parakeet and her pug. I flattened the locusts like potato chips with my combat boots. At Sidwell Friends, where I was overlooked by scrimmage captains and not overlooked enough by algebra and biology teachers, I'd fallen in with the other pariahs. Somewhere between eighth grade and ninth, the stigmas changed. We wore iron-creased jeans and were pursued by the moral majority one year; the next, we were the ones who kept bongs in our lockers.
 Out of the house, I'd started wearing a black armband honoring the dead soldiers. There were moratorium marches every weekend. One Saturday morning in 1972, I slipped on my armband and caught a bus into the city. All the roads between Pennsylvania Avenue and the Mall had been closed to traffic. Outside of Disneyland, I'd never seen so many people. Couples bounced children on their shoulders; vets in wheelchairs tossed Frisbees; kids dangled out of trees. Over a loudspeaker, someone described the deformities of babies born in napalmed villages. A man passed me a wood chillum. He wore a silver puzzle ring and a grown-out shag and had a bony face that made me think of some French character in a textbook -- Jean Jacques Rousseau, maybe, or Roget, the thesaurus author. When we stood to link arms and sway, he and a woman in a quilt got on either side of me and gently leaned.
 One evening, shortly before my 15th birthday, I picked up the phone in Chevy Chase to call a pizza parlor and heard a man with a nasal voice not unlike Maxwell Smart's ask, "Are all the taps in place?" To celebrate my 15th, I bought a gram of hashish from someone at school. I was sitting at the bus stop in front of Sidwell Friends, fingering the tin-foil nugget inside my parka, when I realized I was being watched. The light changed, some other cars honked and the man in the Buick drove on. But in another minute he was back. I was a little shaky by then, but prepared. I stuck out my thumb. The car's door locks thudded up, and I found my legs carrying me over and in. Through the dirty windows I regarded Peoples Drug Store, Fort Reno Park -- all the places I passed twice a day on the bus. I couldn't bring myself to look at him. He made the turn off Wisconsin Avenue that takes you to Chevy Chase, and it occurred to me that we were going home. Some F.B.I. agents and the young men who worked for my father would deliver speeches in the kitchen about buying drugs and getting into cars with strangers. When he reached for the glove compartment, I braced for a pistol. Instead he removed a pack of Benson & Hedges 100's, punched in the lighter and let his hand fall on the knee of my army fatigues. "So," he said. "What's your name?"
 A sequence of infractions on the order of cutting class and smoking on campus led to a conference between the dean of Sidwell Friends and my mother, at which psychotherapy was strongly recommended. The dean offered the names of some doctors. My mother requested that I be allowed to visit a Christian Science practitioner instead. This is how I came to meet Jeanette McGuiness. Once a week, I took the bus to Mrs. McGuiness's apartment complex in Foggy Bottom, a cluster of recurved luxury buildings known as the Watergate. Her sunny office smelled of potpourri. She often got started by observing that I had a particularly thoughtful expression. Whatever thought I had would instantly vanish. Then Mrs. McGuiness might smile in a way that suggested infinite patience and say something like: "The only reality is divine mind, anyway, dear. Mrs. Eddy teaches us that human thoughts are not spiritual. For instance, if I have a bad dream that seems very vivid, very real, does that make it real?"
 To facilitate current-events discussions, world history students at Sidwell Friends subscribed to Newsweek. A disturbing picture of my father appeared on the cover of the March 19, 1973, issue. Under the headline "Nixon's Palace Guard," the photograph had been enlarged and cropped to reveal both the pores on his face and a microscopic American flag on his lapel. A single paragraph inside referred to the "ramifying scandal named Watergate," identifying the close connections between two men who worked for him, and the Creep underground. About Watergate I understood there had been a break-in and a bugging. When I tried to picture the perpetrators, I saw "Get Smart" KAOS agents. I carried my copy of Newsweek to school but elected to skip history. A month later, I was expelled from Sidwell Friends. I believe my final breach was not showing up for a weekend detention -- but it could have been anything. Two weeks after that, my father resigned.
 "Admit the existence of matter, and you admit that mortality (and therefore disease) has a foundation in fact," writes Mary Baker Eddy in the Christian Science textbook "Science and Health." "Deny the existence of matter, and you can destroy the belief in material conditions."
 In addition to my mother and Mrs. McGuiness, a pair of Christian Science nurses ministered to my father. The order not to discuss his condition held. Almost everyone he knew learned of his illness and his death at the same time -- from newspaper and television accounts. Among the family members aware of his illness in advance of his death, there was strong concern about the news media getting word of the illness; afterward, the worry shifted to what the media would make of the death. His ailment was never officially diagnosed. The wording of the cause listed on his death certificate -- "intra-abdominal neoplasm" -- derives from several negotiations with the Santa Barbara coroner in anticipation of questions from reporters. In the end, the questions never came.
 Outside my grandparents' summer house on an island in Newport Beach, Calif., a bridge and vigilant neighbors kept news crews at bay, but every 20 minutes a tour boat fetched up in front of the house for a picture-taking session. Like everyone else, we spent the first half of the summer of 1973 in front of the TV. I remember a somewhat unlikely gathering -- relatives I hadn't seen in years, people from the island, an old boyfriend of my sister's. My father sat in an armchair by the television, listening more than watching, filling legal pads with his notes, in blue Pentel, on the hearings. He'd pause now and then to deliver a comment on the testimony or the questioning. The bombast of Sam Ervin offended him -- he perfected an imitation of the Senator's drawl. He was convinced John Dean had undergone hypnosis in order to improve his memory. When his own turn came to testify, in July, he was diplomatic, receiving either high marks for tact or low ones for vagueness.
 In the spring, just before my father resigned, a reporter had tracked down my sister at college; the interview ran in a local paper under the headline "Susie Haldeman Calls Her Father a 'Fun Guy.' " After his Senate testimony, a Paul Conrad cartoon appeared in The Los Angeles Times depicting my father with stitches zippering his forehead and a bolt stuck through his neck: "Son of Nixonstein." We had been urged to regard "the media" as purveyors of lies, but I was beginning to approach their disseminations as something closer to riddles. Two other news items preoccupied me that summer. One of these, an article in Time titled "Learning to Live With the Scandal," termed my problems at school "an anguished reaction to Watergate." I used to keep a copy of this article in the outside pocket of my backpack, folded like a tiny road map alongside a pack of Marlboros and my P.O.W. bracelet, which had left a greenish indentation around my wrist. I first became aware of the other story two days after a Los Angeles Times photograph of Sam Ervin signing T-shirts silk-screened with his likeness marked the recess of the hearings. On Aug. 9, a grainy picture of detectives training their flashlights on a bloody sheet signaled the discovery of eight more corpses buried in a Houston boat storage lot by a 33-year-old bachelor electrician. Most of the victims in the Dean Corll murder case -- teen-age males who had been raped and strangled or mutilated -- were described as vagrant hitchhikers.
 With my first few paychecks from a gardening job that summer, I bought a 10-speed. I'd planned to use the bike mainly to get to and from drivers education at Corona del Mar High School. But when school let out, at noon, I often found myself heading toward Laguna Beach instead of Newport Beach. Pacific Coast Highway had steep grades and roared with traffic, but the scenery wasn't bad. I rode past mustard fields and little coves colonized by mobile homes. About halfway to Laguna, I usually stopped at a Hadley's stand for a date shake. I never had a terminus in mind. I'd also bought a sleeping bag that summer, one ingredient in a cloudy formula to go somewhere for a long time, and frequently I'd start out on my bike with the intention of not coming back. But my destination never suggested itself. Eventually I'd turn around. At Bay Island, a pile of mail waited for me, letters that sometimes arrived bearing no more than my name and a stamp. Dear Peter Haldeman, these missives would begin, usually handwritten. Between you and your father, you have a normal haircut. Why don't you cut your hair and he can let his grow a little?
 In November, my brother and I and 70 Republican businessmen, attorneys and party figures attended a stag luncheon in my father's honor at Perino's -- a 40-year-old Hancock Park establishment favored more for its velvet banquettes and baroque chandeliers than its menu. We had returned to a sycamore-shrouded mock-Tudor house in our old neighborhood. After the roast beef and cottage fries and apple cake a la mode, there were tributes from a couple of my uncles. Then my father got up to say a few words. In his rep tie and new, mod hair style and sideburns, he looked as genial as a talk show host. He affirmed his confidence in both the President and the judicial system and expressed his intention to cooperate fully with the latter in order to clear his name. We were familiar with this formulation from a single discussion at the dinner table and from a couple of statements issued on the front lawn. He reiterated it two weeks later, when an audit of White House tapes revealed an 18 1/2-minute blank segment on a recording of a conversation between himself and Richard Nixon three days after the Watergate break-in.
 At a basketball game that fall, my father was booed out of Pauley Pavilion. The Los Angeles Country Club, where one of my grandmothers had been living for several years, revoked his membership. Residents on Haldeman Road in Santa Monica, named for my great-grandfather, an early Los Angeles booster, were circulating a petition to have the street renamed. I don't know what these events meant to my parents, because they were never discussed, at least in front of us. I learned about Haldeman Road -- the road itself as well as the petition -- from the newspaper. At Harvard School -- the former military academy in the San Fernando Valley from which my father had graduated and in which I had been enrolled -- the announcements read in homeroom included the notice one morning that anyone interested in joining the tape recorder club should see Peter Haldeman.
 Most of the older students at Harvard School exhibited more passion for their cars than anything else -- ideally Bavarian, with fleece seatcovers and surfboard racks. The political climate here was decidedly milder than at Sidwell Friends. But in some ways, the entire world had changed since we'd left Washington -- and the tape recorder club was not an isolated incident. Your dad's going to jail. Where are the tapes? By the time I'd turned around, it could have been anyone. The easiest response was to sleep. I slept from 3:30, when I got home from school, until 7, when we had dinner. Then I'd go back to bed. I came to the dinner table exhausted and prickly, riled by something as small as the chewing noises people made. My parents did their best not to notice. They would focus on my sister instead. Something odd had happened to Ann. She was narrower and blonder, and at Marlborough School she'd hooked up with all her old Hancock Park girlfriends. She would cheerfully provide detailed accounts of volleyball tournaments or Doobie Brothers concerts. Along with my parents, I listened raptly, silently thanking her for slipping into normalcy.
 On a rare visit to the Sidwell Friends library to research a paper on "The Odyssey," I'd removed the H drawer of the card catalogue, idly flipped back to "homosexuality," inventoried the listings -- there were two -- and returned the drawer to its slot, forgetting to look up "Homer." At Harvard School, I looked up "suicide": one of the titles was "I Can't Face Tomorrow." I glanced up from a blue book during an exam that spring and, in the instant before she looked away, caught an expression on my English teacher's face that I associate with accident gawkers. A Harvard student a year ahead of me recently confided that he used to wonder whether I had a bad slouch or a deformity.
 In the pause before I scared him off, this individual became the closest thing I had to a friend. In his present incarnation as my better half, he enjoys reminding me of 20-year-old events -- incidents perhaps more remarkable or amusing to the observer than to the participant. On Aug. 7, 1974, two days before the President resigned, my father received a call from F.B.I. officials regarding a threat that had been made on his life by an unidentified man in Boston. The previous day, the tape auditors had disclosed a recording of a meeting during which my father and Nixon discussed authorizing the C.I.A. to limit the F.B.I. Watergate investigation. We were back on Bay Island. My friend says that, while a pair of plainclothes F.B.I. agents patrolled the island, the Coast Guard surveyed the shore and a police helicoptor hovered overhead, the Haldemans went about their lives. My mother made tapioca. My father placed a call to the White House to request a Presidential pardon while Nixon was still in a position to grant one. I napped. Everyone else went to the beach. 
 My father's trial began in the fall. My parents rented a small house in Arlington, Va., that my mother sent us pictures of when it had become apparent we would be spending Christmas there. We found the usual mound of presents under the tree. On a snowy morning two days after Christmas, we piled into an old Checker cab borrowed from friends in Chevy Chase and drove to the Federal courthouse to hear the closing arguments in the case of the United States v. Harry Robbins Haldeman. We sat behind my father's lawyers in the dim, unexceptional courtroom and listened to Richard Ben-Veniste, an eloquent Government attorney, present his summation. Ben-Veniste borrowed an image from "Winnie-the-Pooh" to describe my father's connection to the several hundred thousand dollars the Watergate burglars had received a few months after the break-in. He said my father had the "jam" stains of hush money "all over his face and his hands" and he couldn't lick them off. Outside the courtroom, camera crews shoved and strained like dividing cells. I offered my arm to my mother. She said, "Oh, Peter," impatiently, as if I were being melodramatic, and pushed it away. On the drive back to Arlington, in the middle of one of the narrow bridges spanning the Potomac, the Checker cab broke down. My father got out to raise the hood and quickly returned. It had started to snow hard. Several months ago, I had lunch with a friend who mentioned that an acquaintance of his had once shared a hospital room with my father. He said he thought this had occured during the period my father was in prison. I told him this person must have been confused; my father had never seen a doctor, let alone been admitted to a hospital. But last November, when it had become obvious that my father's illness amounted to something more serious than a stomachache, I got on the phone to track down the source of this story. By the time I reached him, in Seattle, I'd prepared a little interrogation. He had most of the answers. He gave the name of one of two hospitals within driving distance of the Lompoc Federal Prison Camp and a date that fell three months after my father's incarceration. He said that he himself had been hospitalized with acute appendicitis and that my father had seemed more concerned about his condition than about his own -- a hernia. He provided other details that checked out and only one that didn't: he thought he remembered my father mentioning a job in the print shop at Lompoc. My father worked in the sewage treatment plant. I called the office of records at the Valley Community Hospital in Santa Maria. They had no documentation that he'd been there.
 During the year and a half my father spent in prison, I visited him once. In September 1977, on my way up the coast to Santa Cruz, I stopped at Lompoc for lunch. At a metal picnic table under a eucalyptus tree losing its leaves and seed buttons, we shared meatloaf sandwiches prepared by my mother. At other tables, families unwrapped steaming Mexican dishes and young, skinny white and black couples in French jeans got reacquainted. It was like a rendering of millennial harmony in a Jehovah's Witness pamphlet. My father asked questions about U.C. Santa Cruz, where he was once a regent and where I was about to start school. We went over finances; the recession had drained the college fund set up by my grandparents and he wasn't able to replenish it. We also discussed a book by Will and Ariel Durant. When he wasn't analyzing waste matter, my father worked his way through the eleven volumes of "The Story of Civilization." We talked for about an hour. It was, as far as I recall, the longest exchange we ever had.
 My father was a member of Mensa and a reputed anti-intellectual. An alumnus of U.C.L.A., he once told me, apropos of a report card at Sidwell Friends, that college was not for everyone. In the two years since I'd managed to graduate from Harvard School, Santa Cruz was my fourth stab at it. The college guidance counselor at Harvard had recommended Vassar; he knew I wanted to get away and they were said to need men. At Vassar, an English professor who cultivated a resemblance to Virginia Woolf stirred some previously dormant impulse to work. I was the only student in this class to make it through the syllabus, which ended with "Our Gang," Philip Roth's Watergate parody. I wanted to stay away. Berkeley offered intensive language classes that lasted all summer. Here I spent most of my time by Strawberry Creek, copying Chinese characters into a notebook, contemplating the faint pulse of the tom-toms outside the student union. The easiest way to transfer to Berkeley was to accumulate another year of language credits through the extension program at U.C.L.A. But at U.C.L.A., I lost my momentum.
 Driving home from Westwood in the thickening afternoon smog, I tallied the reasons not to have returned. The list was long and petty, from the sudden profusion of CB radio antennas to lawns the size of putting greens in front of Hancock Park's antebellum mansions. At home, the brick walls of the den muffled the joking and sparring between my father and his ghostwriter. While awaiting a ruling on his appeal, my father had watched Richard Nixon tell David Frost that he held his chief of staff partly responsible for the Watergate cover-up; the book he's started had been conceived as a response. I still hadn't gotten used to having him around during the day. His presence reminded me of the unexpectedness of my own. I usually slept until dinner. Ann concentrated on college applications and my mother concentrated on Ann and my father. Status quo when the appeal was rejected.
 Sometime in the spring, I began utilizing the research library at U.C.L.A. On the fifth floor, at a carrel by a window overlooking a bank of cafeteria dumpsters and a parking lot, I perused books about suicide. The selection here surpassed that at Harvard School; there were statistical analyses of rates and methods by country and profession, biographies of famous people who had taken their lives, anthologies of suicide notes. I never checked anything out. What the books did was help define the afternoon. Afterward, outside, the light would have contracted a little and I could smell pine needles. At home, in a similar spirit, I experimented with razor blades. For a while, the sight of them in the medicine cabinet amplified whatever I did instead of using them. When I did use them, I was judicious. What I wanted to injure was the urge.
 I DROPPED OUT OF Santa Cruz within the quarter. Back in Los Angeles, most of the members of my family were busy preparing for various Christmas rites, which my father had been granted a furlough to attend, and for the 43d Las Madrinas Debutante Ball in the Beverly Hilton, at which my father would not be present. Las Madrinas committee members had been prevailed upon to let Ann be presented to 800 formally attired supporters of Childrens Hospital on the arm of my brother in lieu of my father. My father's confinement did not interfere with the success of his book, either, which was published two months later and contained enough revelations along the lines of the one identifying Nixon as the most likely engineer of the 18 1/2-minute erasure that it occupied the New York Times best-seller list for nine weeks.
 I didn't read "The Ends of Power," probably because I was afraid I'd find something in it to like. What I needed, I thought, was distance. I returned to the Bay area and sort of hit the road, moving from San Francisco to Berkeley and back to L.A., signing monthly leases and taking temp jobs. I walked into a glowing, pounding place called the I-Beam one evening, bumped into a guy with a tamborine and spent the night at his gingerbread-trim house in the Haight. It was refreshing to wake up in strange surroundings. In San Francisco, there might be expresso in the kitchen and a sliver of a bay view; in L.A., Donna Summer on the stereo and the shadows of giant bird of paradise -- clues to a purposeful existence, either way.
 My older brother and sister had started careers. Ann was at Stanford wieghing the benefits of sorority life. On Dec. 20, 1978, my father was released from prison. My mother held an open house that was so well attended most of the guests I spoke with had been unable to find my father in the crush. Then another Christmas, the tradition that says whatever the world inflicts, we'll always have this. On Christmas Eve, my father's relatives came in tuxes and long bowed dresses to eat Harry & David pears swathed in cream cheese and pomegranate seeds and deliberate over the aerodynamics of whirligig centerpieces from Switzerland. I remember some discussion about two events planned for that summer -- my brother's wedding in June and a family trip to Egypt in August. My memory here owes less to the importance of these occasions than to the fact that they were announced at a time when I was coming to regard future events of any magnitude as challenges.
 Someone at the Hollywod ticket agency where I worked took me to his psychic that spring. I asked her if I would be traveling soon. She clasped my hand, gazed through a curtain of beads at the traffic outside and said, "Yes." "In August?" I asked. "To Egypt?" The psychic said I would not only go to Egypt, I would not return. She was wrong on at least one count. A month or so after my brother's wedding, on a warm Friday evening dense with car exhaust and orange blossoms, I unreeled the bamboo shades in my studio apartment, got a bottle of Smirnoff out of the refrigerator and a bottle of sedatives out of the bathroom and swallowed the capsules with the vodka until I passed out. I'd left a note: Tell my parents they have nothing to do with this. I figured its significance would be lost on the L.A.P.D. officer who woke me up with his baton.
 Instead of Egypt, I was taken to a hospital in Pasadena, a 100-year-old sanitarium where doctors and nurses walked crisply along oak-shaded paths and patients in bathrobes shuffled in and out of wooden cottages. I took to it the way other people take to college. The doctor assigned to me was a student of transactional analysis. I bought a notebook in the pharmacy and filled it with diagrams of circles and arrows. My mother sent postcards of pyramids and, when they returned, visited regularly. My grandmothers came too, carrying boxes of candy from See's in their purses, eager to relate how, many years ago, they had discovered the teachings of Mary Baker Eddy.
 Understandably, my father was concerned about the cost of all this. It turned out that, after a couple of weeks, I was covered by insurance. My first hospitalization lasted half a year. The novelty wore off, along with something like hope. I put down "I'm Okay You're Okay" one afternoon and saw my father standing outside the screen door of my cottage. He held a cookie tin. "How about a game of backgammon?" he asked. He hadn't been to the hospital before, and I didn't want him to get the impression I wasn't making progress. In the recreation room, they were showing "The Other Side of the Mountain." We played in the frosty glow of the snow scenes, divvying up the tollhouse cookies my mother had made, pretending to ignore both the shaking caused by my medication and the details of Jill Kinmont's miraculous triumph over quadriplegia.
 Unhealthy food and daytime television had once satisfied my darker urges. When I returned to Hancock Park, I found the kitchen stocked with Pop-Tarts and frozen mini-pizzas and other things my parents didn't eat. I slept during the day and ate at night, watching TV until the stations signed off with "America, the Beautiful." Once or twice a week about 8 in the evening, there'd be a knock on my door and I'd wash my face and get dressed to play a few games of backgammon in the den. I left the house twice. The first time, I drove to a hardware store to buy some rubber hosing wide enough to fit over the exhaust pipe of my Volkswagon and long enough to clear the window. On a gusty April morning after a week of rain, I put the hose in the back of the car, filled the car with gas and set out for Laguna Beach.
 ON GOOD DAYS, I consider it a comeback; on others a reprieve. At the end of a long dirt road in Laguna Canyon, another conk-out of the will: before yielding to carbon monoxide, my brain gave in to whatever fear stimuli were in effect. I fell out of the car gulping chunks of cool, salty air. I spent another three months in the hospital. For years, I continued to view self-extinction as a sound contingency plan. But I never came as close to implementing it.
 One response to the insistence that the world is an orderly or orderable place, despite all evidence to the contrary, is to marshal the evidence. Back in Hancock Park, I found a book one night in the den called "Them," by Joyce Carol Oates. "Them" is a novel -- one of the few on those shelves -- about a couple of generations of a family in Detroit. A preponderence of Wendalls are raped or murdered or both; the other thing I remember about "Them" is an author's note asserting that the book is based on the experiences of a former student of hers. A day or two after finishing "Them," I showered and put on some clothes and went to find some more books by Joyce Carol Oates. When I returned to school the following year, I switched majors from Chinese to English and resumed the business of reading novels. After school, I turned to writing. As a journalist, I have been accused of writing fiction. I have also been charged with failing to document the more singular details of my own experience.
 What happened to the rest of my family was they went on. My father did not, unlike his friend John Ehrlichman, move to Santa Fe and marry a woman the age of his children and write political thrillers. He did, like me, like most of us, spend the last decade finding a comfortable remove from his past. Apart from the periodic Watergate anniversary, he successfully avoided much public attention. He invested in real estate, taught Sunday School and got around in a Cadillac Sedan DeVille with a license plate frame that read, "I'd Rather Be in Santa Barbara." In 1986, my parents moved from Hancock Park to a region of Santa Barbara where most license plates are obscured by horse-trailer hooks. When he wasn't in front of the computer or on the phone tracking his various investments, my father liked to take his quarter horse, Sam, out on the trails, tend his beds of hybrid tea roses and, when they came along, play with his grandchildren. He generally is said to have "mellowed" in his later years. If he had any personal regrets, he remarked not too Continued on page 64
long ago, he was sorry that we, his children, had not been provided a more thorough schooling in Christian Science.
 His public image evolved -- if that's the word -- from punch line to villain to punch line again. The joke is one I sometimes expect to be hearing for the rest of my life. In the last Clint Eastwood movie I saw, the biggest laughs come when my father is referred to as "a sack of excrement in a cheap suit." I still mumble my name to receptionists and operators and interview subjects. Every now and then, a news item will surface to remind me of the stretch of my father's professional shadow. A few years ago, a researcher turned up a memo from my father to J. Edgar Hoover requesting F.B.I. information on suspected homosexuals in the Washington press corps. I was living in New York at the time but happened to be in California when this discovery was reported. In the category of embarrassing revelations, it's the only one I ever raised with him. We were at the dinner table, and when I asked, my face reddened like a time-lapse rose bloom. Of the thousands of memos he dispatched on the President's behalf, my father said, it didn't ring a bell.
 This squares with my current understanding of how he approached his job. A few years ago, scanning the $3-and-under bin at Crown Books, I came across a copy of "Stonewall," Richard Ben-Veniste's book. I've since read Theodore White and Steven Ambrose and John Dean. I've spent hours in periodicals rooms reviewing 20-year-old issues of The Washington Post and The New York Times -- instinctively scrolling up the reel of microfilm when someone walked by and there happened to be a headline on the screen like "Nixon Gave Tapes to Haldeman." These sources allowed me to piece together the ramifying scandal named Watergate, as Newsweek had it -- the ramifications comprising, in large part, the moral lessons discerned by media heroes and learned the hard way by White House heavies. In one form or another, the lessons concern power. I've been pondering these ramifications lately, along with the significance of the events of the last few months. I think I'd rewrite the moral. For all the power he exercised, I suspect my father was after something closer to its opposite.
 When I finally gave "The Ends of Power" another try, I discovered I needn't have worried about liking it too much. My father, not his ghostwriter, is the invisible one here. He always regarded the book as distorted in its exclusive focus on Watergate -- and he ultimately disclaimed its least faithful portions, attributing them to his collaborator. The 1,400-page journal was intended to provide the big picture. The journal contains new disclosures about his boss and his colleagues and the events of the day. It amply documents Nixon's anxieties about his image. About my father it reveals nothing more and nothing less than this: roughly three-quarters of the sentences in the diary begin with "He" or "The P." The posthumous timing of its publication has been publicly described as an accident. I don't believe the book's schedule is any more random than that of his death.
 There's a Washington scrapbook in my parents' house with an epigraph borrowed from a Nixon speech: Until he has been a part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole. I'd venture that, for my father, the cause itself was secondary. Last November, I got out that scrapbook to study, for maybe the hundreth time, my mother's painstaking documentation of four luminous years in Washington. I also read my father's horoscope in The Santa Barbara News-Press every morning I was there. I remember picking up the phone in his office and realizing that, if automatic-dial numbers are any indication, I'd never heard of most of his closest contacts. I got to know some of them through the messages they left on the machine or the notes they dropped off along with quarts of Haagen-Dazs -- the only mail my father would bring himself to read during his illness. These were his current proteges, the bright, invariably attractive young men whose enterprises he capitalized, and they exemplified the loyalty he prized. In an interview my father gave The News- Press -- his last and the one he disliked the least -- he described his relationship to these men as that of a "father figure."
 Among his other stipulations, my father dictated that there be no observance of his passing. It was the one condition my mother was willing to disregard. She, my brother and sisters, his brother and sister, respective spouses and I gathered in Santa Barbara for a meal and a walk and, in his memory, some readings from "Science and Health." There were to be no personal remembrances -- but here I transgressed. Of everyone seated around the sunny, picture-filled family room, I had the loosest day-to-day connection to my father. I was also probably the quietest by nature, but after a few passages had been read I focused on a little stain in the pale Berber carpet and started to speak. I said it had been difficult to watch him go the way he had, but that certain things had made it less so. Seeing him had been helpful. It was encouraging to find his sense of humor intact. I might have said the same of his intelligence or his humility. I might, too, have thought to add some expression of genuine gratitude for the rich and eccentric architecture of our lives. Instead, I recalled the night a week earlier, when we were summoned to his bedroom at 4 because he felt he had arrived at "a point of transition." He'd uttered a few words -- they were rare enough to repeat then and not now. Then he'd cleared his throat and straightend himself against his pillows, and my mother had said whoever wanted to leave the room was free to go.

STORIES OF SCOTTSBORO
By James Goodman.
Illustrated. 465 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $27.50. 
 IT began with a fight between white and black hobos aboard a freight train bound for Memphis in the winter of 1931. Word of the brawl reached the sheriff in Jackson County, Ala., who deputized a posse to round up "every Negro" on the train. Dozens of heavily armed white men stopped the slow-moving freight at an isolated depot; a search of the boxcars and gondolas turned up nine black youths, ranging in age from 13 to 19. They were arrested for assault, chained together with a plow line and driven on the back of a rickety flatbed truck to the county jail at Scottsboro, a farming town of 3,500 in the lower Tennessee Valley.
Later that afternoon, a far more serious charge emerged. Two white women found running alongside the railroad tracks had accused all nine suspects of raping them on the train. As news of their story spread across the county, a huge crowd, chanting "Give 'em to us" and "Let those niggers out," threatened to storm the Scottsboro jail. A desperate phone call alerted the Governor of Alabama, who wisely sent in the National Guard.
The trials were held in a Scottsboro courthouse ringed by troops in full battle gear. The star witnesses -- Victoria Price and Ruby Bates -- recalled the heroic struggle they had waged aboard the train to ward off their attackers. "It took three of those Negroes to hold me," said Price, an unemployed cotton mill worker from Huntsville, Ala. "Six of them had intercourse with me." Their testimony was so shocking that women of all ages and men under 21 were barred from the courtroom.
The juries barely deliberated before convicting eight of the youths and sentencing them to death. (The case of 13-year-old Roy Wright ended in a mistrial when his jury could not decide between life imprisonment and the electric chair.) "The courtroom," said Haywood Patterson, the most outspoken of the defendants, "was one big smiling white face."
The press called them the Scottsboro Boys, and for many in America their plight became a symbol of the oppression faced by black Americans in a region where white supremacy was an uncontested fact of life. "Countless people were outraged by the trials and death sentences," writes James Goodman in "Stories of Scottsboro," a superb retelling of this vital but largely forgotten episode. "Countless others were outraged by the outrage. Appeals led to seven retrials and two landmark Supreme Court decisions. The defendants spent no less than 6, and as many as 19, years in jail."
Mr. Goodman, who teaches history at Harvard, owes a great debt to Dan T. Carter's absorbing account of the case, "Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South," published in 1969. Yet Mr. Goodman breaks fresh ground himself by ignoring the boundaries of narrative history and moving back and forth across time to provide multiple versions of each crucial event. The result is a complicated, often perplexing story in which the perceptions of Scottsboro's major characters -- blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, patricians and dirt farmers, defendants and accusers -- clash repeatedly in search of the truth.
One truth was apparent from the start. No group worked harder or longer to free the "boys" than the American Communist Party. Within days of the arrests, the Communists were providing both legal assistance and editorial support. To party leaders, the Scottsboro trial was a political bonanza, a perfect example of "ruling-class justice" in action. The young men, after all, were the barely literate sons of sharecroppers and servants. As blacks, they faced crippling race prejudice in a nation that preached equality for all; as jobless drifters, they mirrored the pain that capitalism's ultimate failure -- the Great Depression -- had inflicted on the masses.
Many distrusted the party's motives, fearing it wanted dead martyrs above all else. Actually, the opposite was true. As Mr. Goodman demonstrates, the Communists almost certainly saved the young men by insisting on their innocence at a time when other groups, including the N.A.A.C.P., were wary of defending any black accused of raping a white woman. Indeed, the youths and their families chose to be represented by the party's International Labor Defense because, as one of the mothers noted, "they are the only ones who put up a fight to save these boys and I am with them to the end."
The Communists picked an outsider, a mainstream defense attorney with no radical connections, to represent the youths at the new trials and appeals. His name was Samuel Leibowitz, and few could doubt his record or his skill. A tall, heavyset New Yorker, Leibowitz "had excelled at drama and debating" at Cornell, and "his vibrant voice and extraordinary sense of timing were as useful to him as his prodigious preparation, attention to detail and mastery of the law." In 15 years of practice, Leibowitz had defended 78 people accused of first-degree murder; 77 had been acquitted, and in the one other trial, the result was a hung jury. He decided to represent the Scottsboro Boys without fee after a black Communist lawyer convinced him of their innocence. What Leibowitz demanded in return was the freedom to defend these young men without political interference. The Communists agreed.
Leibowitz came on board several weeks after the Supreme Court of the United States had overturned the Scottsboro convictions by ruling, in Powell v. Alabama, that the defendants were effectively denied counsel in violation of the 14th Amendment's "due process" clause. At their second trial -- held in 1933 in Decatur, Ala., a Ku Klux Klan stronghold 50 miles west of Scottsboro -- Leibowitz quickly took charge. He moved for a dismissal on the ground that blacks had been systematically excluded from Alabama's jury rolls. To prove his point, Leibowitz questioned a series of black and white witnesses, none of whom could recall a single black ever having been called for jury duty. The difference, however, was that the whites could not understand why anyone would choose to have it otherwise. To their thinking, blacks simply lacked the character to judge other people's fates. Did that mean they were dishonest, Leibowitz asked a local newspaper editor. "Yes, sir," he replied. "They will nearly all steal."
Judge James Horton denied Leibowitz's motion and ordered the trial to begin. But Horton, a wealthy landowner with deep antebellum roots in Alabama, was clearly troubled by the case, Mr. Goodman explains. For one thing, he did not believe that all nine of the defendants could possibly have taken part in the crime. They had been captured in groups of two and three aboard a very long train. One of the youths was nearly blind; another had been suffering from a case of venereal disease so painful that he had to walk with a cane. How could they have jumped from car to car to take part in a brawl -- or a rape?
Horton was even more troubled by the claims of the two women, Price and Bates. They said that a terrible struggle had ensued, yet their bodies were barely bruised. One of their examining physicians told Horton, in confidence, that the women had lied about the rape and "laughed at me" as they were being tested. "Judge, God knows I want to, but I can't," the doctor said when Horton urged him to testify. "If I testified for those boys I'd never be able to go back into Jackson County."
It probably wouldn't have mattered. Leibowitz produced one bombshell after another, to no avail. His first major witness, a white hobo who had boarded the freight train with Victoria Price, described her -- accurately, it turned out -- as a prostitute and an adulterer. And his next witness was none other than Ruby Bates, who had decided to tell the truth, she said, after months of soul-searching and prayer. There had been no rape on the train, Bates stammered. Victoria Price had made up the story because she feared that the posse would arrest her for transporting a minor -- Bates was then 17 -- across state lines for the purpose of prostitution.
The prosecutors were stunned. They lashed out at the witnesses as ugly liars, pawns of Jews and Communists, and traitors to the South. At the end of his summation, one prosecutor asked the jury to consider a single question: "Is justice in the case going to be bought and sold in Alabama with Jew money from New York?"
The jurors obliged. Their verdict, once again, was guilty, and the sentence was death. Believing that Ruby Bates had been corrupted by Northern infidels, Mr. Goodman says, they saw no alternative but to accept the word of her traveling companion, Victoria Price. The fact that Price had led a hardscrabble life -- that she had grown up poor, quit school early, worked as a mill girl, lived in hobo jungles and made some poor moral choices -- seemed only to soften the hearts of these 12 plain, stern, white Alabama men. Leibowitz, who had confidently predicted an acquittal, now exploded in rage. Asked by a reporter to explain the verdict, he portrayed white Southerners en masse as "lantern-jawed morons," adding, "If you ever saw those creatures, those bigots whose mouths are slits in their faces, whose eyes popped out at you like frogs, whose chins dripped tobacco juice, bewhiskered and filthy, you would not ask how they could do it."
THE verdict may not have surprised Judge Horton, but it surely embarrassed him. Horton, Mr. Goodman writes, well understood the deep sexual fears that Southern whites harbored toward blacks. He had seen his share of lynchings over allegations far less spectacular than those reported in the Scottsboro case. He knew that many white men considered blacks primitive beings who ravaged white women out of lust, revenge or sometimes both. He knew that many white women lived in constant fear of being sexually assaulted by blacks, though such offenses were extremely rare. And his years on the bench had taught him that whites routinely accused blacks of crimes in order to conceal evidence of their own misconduct.
As Mr. Goodman makes clear, however, the behavior of Leibowitz and other supporters of the Scottsboro Boys was not without serious moral flaws. In his summation, Leibowitz played shamelessly on the racial prejudices of the jury by describing his own client as a "poor, moronic colored boy." And his cross-examination of Victoria Price raised the dangerous notion that prostitutes did not deserve the full protection of the law -- a notion widely accepted by Northern civil rights advocates at this time. Indeed, the black writer Langston Hughes ended his bitter essay on Scottsboro by asking, "And who ever heard of raping a prostitute?"
In an astonishing reversal, Judge Horton set aside the convictions, citing the "unreliability" of the state's only major witness, Victoria Price. His words bristled with a contempt born of gentlemanly breeding as he charged that women of her "character" were prone to make "false accusations" of rape "for ulterior purposes." In a sense, Horton had done the unthinkable by chastising a white woman who had accused black men of sexually assaulting her. But Victoria Price was not a true representative of Southern womanhood, Horton believed, and that put her beyond the reach of his chivalrous protection.
As expected, the state of Alabama ordered an immediate retrial. Judge Horton was replaced by Judge William Callahan, an ignorant 70-year-old jurist who assumed, among other things, that black men could not keep themselves from raping white women and that white women would never willingly have sex with black men. The prosecutor summed up his case by warning that an acquittal would force the female population of Alabama to "buckle six-shooters around their middles" so as to protect "the sacred parts of their bodies" from oversexed blacks. And the jurors brought in the predictable verdict and sentence: guilty and death.
Once again, the Supreme Court intervened. In a ground-breaking 1935 decision, Norris v. Alabama, it reversed the convictions on the ground that blacks had been excluded from the juries that indicted the youths. By this time, the story of the Scottsboro Boys had become a national obsession. Tales of Southern racism ran side by side with articles about Hitler's racism in Germany, writes Mr. Goodman, "and for many Northerners one story became an aid to understanding the other."
As Northern protests mounted, Alabama's once-steady resolve began to waver. The clear majority of whites, Mr. Goodman says, still wanted the Scottsboro Boys to hang. Anything less, warned J. Thomas (Cotton Tom) Heflin, a former United States senator, would place "wicked thoughts in the minds of the lawless Negro men." Yet a number of influential whites now urged clemency for the youths as a way of protecting Alabama from further ridicule and abuse. "I don't care what they do," the editor of The Montgomery Advertiser fumed, "so long as they do it in another state, preferably Ohio or New York. I don't care if they eat one another without benefit of pepper sauce. I do not know whether they are guilty or innocent of the rape of two cut-rate prostitutes. I do not care."
In 1937, the state released four of the Scottsboro Boys -- the two youngest and the two most sickly -- as a gesture of good will. The other five were retried, found guilty and sentenced to long terms in prison. But as time passed and memories dimmed in Alabama, four of them were quietly paroled -- one in 1943, two in 1944, another in 1946. Haywood Patterson, described by state parole officials as "vicious" and "incorrigible," escaped from prison in 1948 and fled to Detroit. Arrested two years later by the F.B.I., Patterson was set free after Michigan rebuffed Alabama's halfhearted attempt to have him returned.
Freedom did not prove kind to the Scottsboro Boys, Mr. Goodman reports. The products of violent homes and prison beatings, they drifted north to places like New York and Cleveland without skills or clear direction. Most of them found trouble, and some went back to jail. Roy Wright, the youngest of the Scottsboro Boys, committed suicide after killing his wife. Patterson died in a Michigan prison after murdering a man in a barroom brawl. "Everywhere I go," said one of the nine, "it seems like Scottsboro is throwed up in my face. . . . I don't believe I'll ever live it down."
Mr. Goodman tells us nothing about the later lives of Ruby Bates, Victoria Price and Samuel Leibowitz. The two women went their separate ways and were quickly forgotten. Leibowitz returned to New York, became a criminal court judge and made headlines with his stormy behavior and his harsh treatment of defendants. As a lawyer, he recalled, "my job . . . was to sell my client's cause to the jury." As a judge, he added, "I was tough with hardened criminals; toughness was all they understand." He died in 1978.
The injustice of Scottsboro has long since faded from view. The names of Roy Wright and Haywood Patterson and the others do not appear alongside the names of Rosa Parks, Emmett Till and Medgar Evers on the list of those who made a difference in the struggle for civil rights. Yet one cannot read Mr. Goodman's remarkable book without being moved by the courage and resilience of these simple young men. Clarence Norris was 18 when Victoria Price accused him of rape. Facing the death sentence at his third trial, he was asked if he had anything to say. "Yes, sir," Norris calmly told the judge. "They didn't find me guilty. They just thought they did. I am accused of a crime I never even thought about committing."

HEADLINE: GENERATION RAP

BYLINE: By Sheila Rule; Sheila Rule reports on popular music for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IN 1968 A TRIO OF BLACK poets went on stage in Harlem at a commemoration of Malcolm X and framed their political verse with a chant: "Are you ready, niggas? You've got to be ready." That was the beginning for the Last Poets, influential forefathers of rap. The original members -- Abiodun Oyewole, David Nelson and Gylan Kain -- and the Last Poets who succeeded them welded revolutionary politics, incendiary street language and jazzy musical accompaniment into a polyrhythmic wake-up call to America.
A quarter of a century later, Ice Cube lifts his voice and commands worldwide attention as one of hip-hop's angriest young men. He first appeared with N.W.A. (Niggas With Attitude), the Compton, Calif., group that put the sub-genre called "gangsta rap" on the charts, and now sells millions of records solo with his hard-core imagery of an urban landscape bristling with blood and bullets, profanity, misogyny and potent beats. 
 Today Mr. Oyewole, 46, is a consultant for creative writing to New York City schools and uses material from the Poets, as well as his more recent poetry, in his teaching. He can be heard on a new Last Poets album, "Holy Terror," which was released in Japan last year on the P-Vine record label and is to be released here later this year. Ice Cube, 24, who has become a follower of the Rev. Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, recently released his fifth recording, "Lethal Injection" (Priority Re cords). It peaked at No. 5 on Billboard's chart of the 200 best-selling albums.
The record's success comes amid ever more vocal outrage over hard-core rap's graphic depiction of sexual conquests, drug use and gangs, and its glorification of violence toward women and homosexuals. WBLS-FM in New York City and other radio stations around the country are limiting air play of hard-core rap, playing edited versions or banning it outright; Congress has examined it in hearings on Capitol Hill; black leaders are denouncing the music as immoral and self-destructive and are organizing demonstrations at record stores and elsewhere. The backlash was given more fuel by the arrests of three major hip-hop artists on charges including sexual assault and murder: Tupac Shakur, Flavor Flav and Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose album, "Doggy style," was released in the midst of his troubles and was the first debut ever to enter the Billboard album chart at No. 1. And last month, T-Bone, one of Ice Cube's back-up singers, was also charged with murder. With critics particularly agitated over what influence the music may be having on young listeners, gangsta rappers say: don't shoot the messengers -- we are simply chronicling life the way it is in the jagged-edged inner city.
The New York Times Magazine invited Mr. Oyewole and Ice Cube to have a conversation across the generations. They had never met. They got together one sunny afternoon at Ice Cube's Street Knowledge production offices, in South-Central Los Angeles, and talked about a range of topics, including the messages and motivations of rappers, their own personal visions and being black in America.
ABIODUN OYEWOLE: We're 20 years apart, almost exactly 20 years. I started at a young age, dealing with some words that were earth-shattering. My mother would not even listen to the records I made back in those days because of the language we used. But we moved the people to think and change. Was that a mission with you when you first started writing?
ICE CUBE: Well, basically, I was a fan of the music, being 10 years old when the first rap jam came out. I was just out of nursery rhymes. So I tried it and fell in love. I said, I'm going to do records my homeboys down the street like. That was my main concern, you know, just recognition in the neighborhood. What I wanted to do was be witty.
A. O. : All the young brothers that were writing poetry -- sisters, as well -- we didn't just want to deal with complaining about how the system has got its foot on our necks. We had a particular ideal for the life style we wanted, and we were willing to give our lives to live that life style. Did you have a personal ideal, besides wanting to be witty?
I. C. : Well, not when I first started. When I first started, I was dead. I never went outside, or if I did I had negative thoughts. Who gonna see me? If they do see me, what's gonna pop? But when I was able to travel and kind of open up -- you know, getting love, you want to give love. But you got to give it in the right context.
A. O. : So you're waking up.
I. C. : Yeah. Some people don't like us because we distribute information without going through WBLS. I don't care if WBLS never plays one of my songs. It's not going to matter, because I think the people feel the same way I feel. They're gonna seek my stuff as long as I stay true.
Now, what we have today is some rappers want to put knowledge in their records, and some rappers don't. You got the older generation of so-called leaders want to come talk to us, want to sit down and rap to us. But it's no dialogue there. They always let the small things or small differences interfere with the bigger picture. If I use the word "bitch," to me it's just language.
A. O. : But language does control. Language sets us up for a whole bunch of things. Language incites us. That's why when we used words like "bitch" in the Last Poets, we made it clear that those words were used not loosely, but specifically to talk about a particular character in the community, not everybody. It really hurt me when N.W.A. sampled us on "Real Niggers Don't Die," and they sampled "Die Nigger" and they had, I think it was, "Niggers die, niggers die for 400 years. Die, nigger, die, nigger, die, nigger, die." But then the brother comes in and says, "Real niggers don't die." And they missed the most important part, because that poem says, "Niggers watch Nat Turner die, niggers watch Emmett Till die, niggers watch Medgar Evers die, watch niggers die, die, die. Die, nigger, die, nigger, die; they can die so black folks can take over." And that's the point. Get rid of the nigger, you get rid of the bitch, so that the beauty of your folks will emerge.
I. C. : But I can't go to the Japanese talking Chinese. I have to speak the language of the street to get their ear. See, the teacher, the preacher, the politician won't talk real to the kids. So that's why they won't listen to them. You got to talk in their language and guide them to the place, and that's exactly what we're doing. When I talk about a certain problem in the community, I'm not talking about everybody; I'm talking about people I call suckers. I call them Negroes. Sex rules countries, so it's ruling our neighborhood. If you ask anybody in the streets, they say if you have a Benz, you can get all the women. And that's what the brothers fighting over. So material things become more important than the person.
How do you deal with that? You have to tell the brother who does that material thing to get the woman, you a fool. And you got to tell it to the woman, and they have to be called something that nobody likes to be called. Malcolm X said, Throw a rock in a pack of dogs and the only one hollers is the one that gets hit. So if you see yourself in my lyrics, then you got to change what you're doing.
A. O. : It's like, if the shoe fits wear it. You just explained it beautifully. It's the same thing we did in the Poets. But you have to spell it out for the folks sometimes, and you have to take time out to do that.
When we see the devastation of our people, then we have got to make "sister" a word in the 'hood, so it's not a foreign word to the brothers and sisters. I have this piece that I do in the schools all the time, just to prove a point. I say, "How many of you brothers and sisters in the school deal with 'bitch' as a word?" Everybody raises their hand. Then I tell the brothers to tell their girlfriends this: "Brown sugar, honey bunny, lady chocolate supreme, you are the one that I see when I'm having a dream.' The point being, I would much better infect your mind with a positive antidote for you to take as opposed to taking you on the bitch trip just to try to turn you around. If I go into any community in this town right now, Crenshaw, Compton, anyplace in this town, and I run "Brown Sugar" down, I'm gonna get nothing but praise from all the sisters and the brothers because we want to hear something good about ourselves.
So some time you're going to have to try to explain to people: "I'm not talking about all my sisters. You know, I'm not talking about my mother." It's got to be clear. And then people start to say, "Oooh, so when he says 'bitch,' he really means 'bitch.' "
I. C. : I'm with that 100 percent. The thing is, it's not like we're going this negative route to go a positive route. The negative route was set in motion and most of us, with no knowledge, jump in that motion and are still turning with that motion.
What happened to the word "brother" -- and "sister" -- so many people said it and didn't mean it. That's what killed that word, because so many people said, "Brother, I love you," and didn't mean it.
A. O. : The difference between you and me and then and now is that my whole thing was specifically from a political arena. The Last Poets came on to rebel against a system that had us all in check, whereas the kids like you all have been seen as coming on as a cartoon.
I. C. : Yeah. You all come from way different backgrounds. See, the reason why I go to the defense of brothers like Snoop and Tupac, I used to be right there. I think they're still looking for recognition from the homies. These people became stars overnight. Everybody in the neighborhood got a certain rank. And the so-called O.G.'s [original gangstas] gave them a rank. So when they became famous, they kind of surpassed the O.G.'s, but they still looked up to them. So they pick them up and drive them around. So now they riding around, boom, boom, boom, boom. They got to show they still down even though they doing records, that they ain't selling out.
This stardom has come so fast they can't feel it. They still can only feel it within their circle of homeboys, or peers.
You really have to get on the boat and throw the life jacket and say, "Let me pull you on the boat." You can say to that same O.G., "Yo, man, I'm doing this video. I can get you on a job as a grip where you can learn something." That's better for the O.G. than going, "I'm here. I'm still down."
A. O. : This addiction to sex and violence, what happened? This was an area of the country the Panthers came out of. There was some serious black stuff going down out here. What happened to that, man?
I. C. : The TV taught the kids more than the parents because the TV was 24 hours a day. And you sit up here 24 hours a day looking at foolishness, and so you're addicted. You want to see the cartoons -- very violent. That's the first thing. There are more weapons in Toys "R" Us than there are at the gun shop.
Now the people from the older generation, they remember life without television. We don't know that.
A. O. : I'm this old guy, man, and I got this ideal that we're gonna get to a point where we can just do like Nina Simone said when she did her album called "Black Gold." I don't know if you've got it. It's the first time that she ever sang "Young, Gifted and Black." She said: "This next song is not a protest song. It is not a protest song against any white person who may be in the audience; it is just simply ignoring you." [Sings] "To be young, gifted and black." And I mean, that was one of the most revolutionary statements I've ever heard in my life because the song had nothing to do with whites. How come we haven't gotten to the point where we understand there's only one bank to feed, and it's ours? It's only one love to love, and it's ours. How come we can't see that?
I. C. : Man, you know why? Because the school system is teaching our kids. The people that won't treat you right won't teach you right. Until we start teaching our own that's never gonna come about. Schoolbooks teach you if it's white, it's right. That's why you have a kid that, before he even gets to school, is so smart. Get in school and seem like he got a lobotomy. So I'm saying it's perfect for us to start changing it around.
The kids want to separate from this culture. People started wearing different hair styles. People started wearing their clothes baggy, so they can let the system know that we ain't with this. We're our own people. And we gonna stand on our own, and we gonna try to get some of the fire that was given off in those times for today. People who talk about black nationalism, we just want to control the world we see because we know once we control what's in our neighborhoods, we can control the people in the neighborhoods.
So once we can control, you know, not in a negative way, but just supervise what's going into the heads of our kids, then we can have unity and become an economic strength. And once you become an economic strength here, you got no problems, no more problems.
But some people like a dark room. They done been there so long they don't want you to turn on the light. So you got to light a candle and just place it in a corner, and pretty soon you can light another, pretty soon a whole lot. But if you just turn on a light, you got a fight.
If you look at the course that the rap is going, you have 100,000 so-called gangsta rappers oversaturating the market. Me, I don't consider myself a gangsta rapper.
A. O. : The kids call you an educated gangsta.
I. C. : I consider myself reality because I could give you the gangsta stuff, and I could also give you the knowledge at the same time. What is happening is so-called gangsta rap is starting to look like a comic book to many kids.
The consciousness is starting to seep into the music. Chuck D set in motion the same things that you all set in motion. Trying to build it back up. And you have gangsta rap, which is the negative image of all that, and the negative things that are happening is at the peak.
A. O. : I try to make it clear to a lot of the brothers and sisters who have this problem with gangsta rap and the roughnecks and the hard-core that, you know, these are our warriors. This is our army. These brothers are looking for rites of passage. There ain't no lion for them to go out in the jungle and kill and come back and say, "I've killed the lion. Now I'm a man." So they kill each other. They kill whatever is there, but there's a rebellious spirit that is in all of us. I have a piece that's on our "Holy Terror" album called "Black Rage," and the hook line is "Grenades in their eyes." And I see the grenades in the brothers' eyes. And I understand it. I'm not afraid of it, but it terrorizes my mother. My mother's not going to cross the street if she sees three baggy shadow boys standing on the corner. She's gonna wait for the cops to come because she don't know if they gonna rip her off or take her purse, when it should be that she sees them and she's protected by them. And that's got to come out in the lyrics.
Rap has made itself a billion-dollar industry, and you and some other brothers are sitting at the top of the charts because of the simple reason that people have a need to express themselves and hear their own voice. And you have been that mirror, reflecting a lot of the pain and the joy within the pain they have felt. But the reality is, what we got to do is take all of that pain and joy and give it some focus and direction so we can have a tomorrow. But not only for you -- for me, too, as old as I am. I'm 40-plus. I still got to grow. And I've got to respect and recognize that your rebel spirit is the same rebel spirit I had.
I. C. : And we're just running with it, and we run into each other with it. We're running all over. I mean, we're terrible.
A. O. : It's the absence of a movement. You see, the one thing we did have were the Panthers, even though I was not a Panther, but they were there giving you those slogans and a 10-point program, breakfast programs, school programs. There was the Nation of Islam. I wasn't a member, but they were there. There was a movement going on. Martin Luther King was marching. You all haven't had that. So that's why you all go run into each other. I couldn't talk to brothers -- a lot of the brothers I respected who were street knowledgeable of other things -- without having read Harold Cruse's "Crisis of the Negro Intellectual," without having read thoroughly "The Autobiography of Malcolm X." I had to read Chancellor Williams's "Destruction of Black Civilization." I had to sit down and read those books because folks were quoting things out of the pages and I didn't know what they were talking about if I didn't read the book.
I. C. : I'm not really, to be honest, a book person. You know, I'm just inspired by people.
A. O. : And that's beautiful. But, still, those of us who realize that we should not let any discipline be an obstacle to our growth need to encourage reading of some materials, because we've got some brothers and sisters who have written something for us to know.
I. C. : What books do you suggest?
A. O. : One of the books I would suggest you get in your library, especially since you're a rapper and use words well, is "Black Fire." It's an anthology of poetry and it's as thick as the Bible. It's an anthology of the baddest poetry written in the 60's.
I. C. : A lot of the rappers don't know nothing but what they know. And people are trying to clump us all together. I mean, don't come against us. We're the only people who can distribute information without going through any kind of channels. What I want to do is be able to talk -- I want the brothers in L.A. to know the same thing the brothers in New York know, same thing, boom, boom, the brothers in Jamaica know.
A. O. : You want lines of communication to be open for all of us.
I. C. : Rap music is that only line. These kids are fired up. They just have to know directions, because our so-called leaders are trying to make the public school better instead of trying to build our own schools. A lot of people feel that people from the 60's took their eyes off of the prize in the 70's. And we picked it up ourselves, and now they want to show us how to do it. They want us to do it the same way they did it, and it didn't work. So you have kids who don't want to listen. Or you have leaders, spineless, just no kind of strength.
A. O. : We fell short on a lot of levels in terms of securing a place for you all. I've done a decent job with my kids, thank God, and I've had a lot of help to do that, but we had a lot of brothers and sisters who didn't, and they let their frustrations take charge of their lives and, consequently, they also sent their kids to the room and told them to watch television.
The bottom line is, I do know that at this point in time if we don't make some serious collaborations to try to develop some programs and activities to save our people, we're full of it.
I.C. : Oh, yeah.
A. O. : And if we make some opportunities in terms of the record business to get some words out there, we've got to think about how those little minds are gonna take whatever we say and run with it because they've got nothing else. If they like you -- especially if they love you -- they're going to take whatever you say as the truth.
I. C. : Yeah. It's not just slang.
A. O. : So what do we do? How do we try to empower ourselves? What can we do to build up our people again?
I. C. : One thing I believe we need to do, we got to separate. We really have to say, "O.K., white folks. You want to help us? You go to your community and break down the walls." When they're in there talking in the board room, talking about us, you go correct them. Don't come here picking up trash.
A. O. : Yeah. Being a missionary and all that stuff.
I. C. : We can do that. You handle yours, we'll handle ours.
A. O. : That's true, and in doing so, Cube, we're going to have to be ardently serious about instilling values, because we've got kids who think it's cute for a girl to give somebody [oral sex] in public. The sacredness of us is gone, man, and that hurts me so much because we're a loving, ritualistic people.
I. C. : I'm telling you, the only way we can achieve this, man, is to separate. That's the only way we can achieve it. We have too many outside influences.
A. O. : You are a young teacher, and I have to truly give you credit, Cube. From what I know from hearing stuff early on and now talking to you personally, I love your evolution, brother.
I. C. : Thank you. I'm still growing, man, still growing.

From Stereotypes of Urban Decay to Signs of Life

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
ONE DAY, WE WILL HAVE A generation of public servants who recognize that the urban park system is the supreme democratic art form. I wish that day were here, for we have in hand a plan that could help rejuvenate that art form in America's largest city.
"Public Space for Public Life: A Plan for the 21st Century" provokes hope and despair in equal measure. Prepared under the auspices of two private groups, the Parks Council and the Central Park Conservancy, the $3 billion, 10-year plan offers inspiring proof that the civic spirit lives in New York City. At the same time, as the plan documents with depressingly stark graphs and charts, the public has lost ground in the fight to keep the city green. 
 New York, a city that gave birth to the parks movement nearly 150 years ago, now ranks 19th among major American cities in dollars spent per citizen to maintain its park system. The system's operating budget, per acre, is one-sixth that of Chicago, half that of Los Angeles. In the past three years New York's Department of Parks and Recreation has been forced to cut its full-time staff by a quarter. Today the work force tending the parks is half the size it was in 1960.
The numbers may surprise those who have been dazzled by some recent, well-publicized successes: the miraculous rebirth of Bryant Park, the creation of Riverbank Park in Harlem and Hudson River Park in lower Manhattan. But these achievements, made possible by money from private sources and New York State, have obscured the steady decline in the city's system. By laying bare the grim statistics, "Public Space for Public Life" hopes to stir people to action.
The plan is not all it could be. For one thing, it is misleadingly titled. This is not, alas, a 21st-century plan, or even a 20th-century plan. It is, for the most part, a sensible, well-thought-out extension of Frederick Law Olmsted's 19th-century ideas into a late-20th century metropolis. All of the plan's major recommendations -- community parks, greenways, riverside esplanades and wilderness preserves -- derive from Olmsted's pioneering vision. This doesn't mean they are obsolete. Olmsted's ideas demonstrate their enduring value every day. But his pastoral vision of nature does not accord with our increasing understanding of the ecologically complex relationships between cities and their environments. An urban park system should lead the way toward forms that enhance this awareness.
It is also disappointing that the plan does not foresee a more important role for design. Why should Barcelona be the only city with the nerve to enlist emerging architects in a citywide program of new public spaces? As the Architectural League's 1992 "Productive Park" show made extravagantly clear, there's no shortage of talented New York designers eager to apply their skills and imagination to the public realm.
Fortunately, the plan, which has the support of Henry Stern, the Parks Commissioner, does not preclude modifications along these lines. At once comprehensive and flexible, it carves out a network of places where many different ideas about the public and natural realms could be pursued. Its strategy for community parks, in particular, holds great potential for innovation.
A hundred new parks. No, better than that, 100 miniature park systems, each reflecting the different needs and identities of 100 diverse New York neighborhoods. Yet the communities designated by the plan to receive these new public spaces have some features in common. All are densely populated; most have less than the average amount of park land (1.5 acres for every 1,000 people).
And they all suffer from more than their share of inner city woes: poverty, high crime rates, derelict buildings, drugs. East New York, Central Harlem, the South Bronx: even their names are synonymous with urban
decline.
Yet as the plan points out, the problems afflicting these neighborhoods have created opportunity as well as need. As a result of economic decline, the city has acquired more than 20,000 parcels of vacant and abandoned land. Utilizing about 1,000 of these lots, 500 acres in all, the plan proposes a cluster of parks for each neighborhood: a two-acre "central park" supported by four smaller satellite parks, gardens or playgrounds.
The key to the concept isn't size, location or design. It is staffing and management. Each neighborhood park system would be supervised by the Parks Department but sponsored by one or more community groups, a church or a school, say, which would help design the park, set up programs and organize local volunteers. In addition to the volunteers, six full-time workers would be needed to operate each system, half of them Parks Department employees, the rest paid by private groups or other government programs. Thus the park becomes a place to bring together public support and neighborhood responsibility.
While Olmsted envisioned community parks, he did not foresee this degree of community involvement. But the community-based park idea has been tested in neighborhoods throughout the city, in projects like the aptly named Success Garden in central Harlem, sponsored by the Parks Council and School Community District 5. The plan seeks to increase such initiatives to the level of critical mass.
The estimated cost of these parks is
$195 million, plus $20 million a year in operating expenses. To a degree, this can be regarded as a public investment. As Olmsted foresaw, parks improve property values. Community-based parks also provide poor neighborhoods with jobs and training.
But something else is going on here that's just as important as economic revitalization. Community parks have the power to reveal that these neighborhoods, even in their present condition, are integral parts of the city. New Yorkers live here. They work and pay taxes. They've invested in the city's future. What the plan is calling for is not scenic welfare. It is equity.
And it would do more than transform vacant lots. It would also change symbols -- turning the lurid stereotypes of urban decay into signs of life. The rubble-filled lot reflects a reality, but also distorts it. It casts a community in the image of its dregs. Imagine how Central Park would look if, like the picture of Dorian Gray, it expressed the baser instincts of those who inhabit its prized perimeter. Think how much pruning and planting it takes to keep that side from showing. "Public Space for Public Life" could not only change New York. It could reveal the face of a city that is already here.

New Disney Park Raises Environmental Concerns

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NOW that the Virginia state legislature has agreed to financial incentives for the Walt Disney Company to build a new theme park in the countryside outside Washington, environmental groups are turning their attention to the changes in land use and transportation patterns that would come with the $650 million project.
The largely agricultural region around Haymarket, Va., where the 3,000-acre historical theme park is to be built, would sprout a big entertainment complex along with offices, shops, hotels and 2,500 homes under the Disney plan. 
 Environmental groups said the state
should plan for the resulting air pollution and development pressures throughout the region, lest it lose more than it gains economically from the giant project.
While the decision by the legislature, and its endorsement by much of the local zoning board, makes it less likely that the project will be blocked, environmentalists have vowed to carry on the fight.
"We don't view this as a fait accompli, and certainly everything we are doing, we hope will improve the project," said Josephine deGive of the Piedmont Environmental Council, a local group that opposes the project.
The administration of Gov. George F. Allen pushed hard for the state to support Disney in the legislative session that ended March 19, arguing that the theme park, emphasizing American history, is expected to generate 19,000 new jobs.
"This is a project that will be the envy of the entire nation," said Governor Allen, who pushed a package through the legislature that financed the building of roads and other improvements on the understanding that the Disney park would create enough tax revenues to service the debt. The company hopes to break ground in late 1995 and open in 1998.
But there are broad social costs to be considered, environmental groups said.
"The Disney America project will undoubtedly change the face of Northern Virginia," said Ralph Grossi, the president of American Farmland Trust, a rural conservation organization based in Washington.
The group says that if the plan proceeds thousands of acres of farmland will face growing pressures of urbanization. It called on the state to devise plans to avoid the destruction of farmland, saying that the 6,000 farms with 1.2 million acres in 12 nearby counties account for a seventh of the state's farmland and farm production, and that the farmers spend $216 million a year.
And eight environmental groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund, warned that the project will make it harder for the metropolitan Washington region to come into compliance with the Clean Air Act. Disney has predicted that at least 77,000 additional vehicle trips a day will result from the project, including twice the normal traffic on Interstate 66, which connects the building site to Washington, 35 miles to the east.
Air quality in Virginia has steadily declined for decades, and during the 1980's the average number of miles driven per person increased by more than 50 percent.
The metropolitan region's governments must come up with plans by November showing the Federal Government how they will meet Federal health standards for air quality, largely by controlling automobile emissions. If they fail to do so they could lose Federal transportation grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
A recent report by the Environmental Law Institute, based in Washington, said the state's prosperity was linked both to tourism and to the environment. "In 1990, domestic and international travelers spent more than $8 billion in Virginia, and travel related businesses supported 159,000 jobs and paid $380 million in state and local taxes," the report said.
It recommended that Virginia "mobilize vigorously" to protect its natural resources "so that it can prevent potentially detrimental impacts resulting from the same visitors who generate income for the Commonwealth." The organization has not taken a formal position on the park.

HEADLINE: THE SOUND OF NON-MUSIC

 BODY:
John Tierney is living in a fantasy version of New York (The Big City: "The Sound of Non-Music," March 13). His New York is filled with demonic theatrical unions and innocent, beleaguered producers who have (so sadly) failed to form a monopolistic cartel.
Obviously, Mr. Tierney is unaware of the reality on Broadway, which is far less romantic than he might wish. To wit: 
 1) The cost of producing Broadway shows has risen dramatically over the past 20 years while the cost of employing musicians has actually declined as a percentage of the total, and has barely kept pace with inflation.
2) "Tommy" is the first musical in 5 years to have "walkers," and is the first new production in 15 years whose producers have chosen to use an orchestra smaller than contractually agreed upon.
Mr. Tierney's straw man arguments (e.g. musicians' rigid work rules are driving up costs on Broadway) may seem persuasive on the surface, but they obscure a far greater danger -- that technologically reproduced music (synthesizers and tapes) will replace live music in the theater. Live music is having a tough enough time surviving in New York without the appearance of an anti union diatribe disguised as a feature about Runyonesque local color.

HEADLINE: ART;
The Travails of Victorian Women Achieving Fame as Artists

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

 BODY:
THE show now at the Yale Center for British Art leads off with books, several of them classics like "Wuthering Heights" and "Jane Eyre." It also takes its title, "A Struggle for Fame," from a book by Charlotte Riddell, the Irish novelist who was living in London at the end of the 19th century.
Though Riddell went on to achieve fame, this, her first effort, written in 1883 when she was 51, has remained obscure. It would seem, however, that the story, based on the writer's own experience of breaking into the literary world, sums up the difficulties faced by Victorian women trying to make it as writers and artists in a man's world. 
 In any case, the show's curators, Susan P. Casteras and Linda H. Peterson, use the novel as a jumping-off point for their catalogue essays. As explained by Ms. Casteras, who is the center's curator of paintings, a "key message" concerns "the mixture of conflict, ambivalence, frustration and guilt at the prospect of fame and its attendant power generated for her and other women."
Ms. Casteras, who is the more polemic of the two writers and the more inclined to view history through contemporary eyes, covers the lot of 19th-century women from many angles, finding much cause for irony. At the same time, she concedes that where art was concerned, men were no more likely to contest the status quo than women.
Thus, the generally conservative output of women should be viewed not as "a sign of simple compliance or timidity" but as "a byproduct of female inbred servility to male authority and of women's insecurity in the art world."
Nevertheless, the curator is quick to praise the artists in the show for their ability to produce, "in the face of overriding cultural disadvantages," pictures of "women's cultural tradition, history and heroism" that belong to a "seemingly endless iconological as well as ideological 'struggle for fame.' "
In her essay, Ms. Peterson, who is a professor of English at Yale, takes a less partisan view and focuses more on individual artists. She also shows a touch of humor, as when she refers to an 1893 book that counseled women intent on combining marriage with a career to get a good housekeeper and send the children to school -- advice that is as sound today as it was then.
Still, for all the information and insights that it provides, the catalogue leaves the viewer in a familiar predicament. To put it simply, with emotions drained by contemporary horrors ranging from widespread poverty at home to atrocities in the Serbian-Croatian conflict, how does one muster passion about the hardships faced by Victorian women artists scarcely less middle class than their male oppressors?
Fortunately, the show comes to the rescue by retrieving many good artists from obscurity. High on the list of graphic performers are the Claxton sisters, Florence and Adelaide, who seem to have been the Peggy Bacons of the 1860's and 70's. In a two-part engraving called "Choice of Paris," Florence aims at Pre-Raphaelite claptrap by setting the contest in a salon full of creative types striking attitudes -- note the esthete scrutinizing a woman's foot through a magnifying glass. Adelaide, though a touch less acerbic than her sister, does a good job on a crowd of Christmas belles, particularly the one in the center who seems to have moths in the brain.
Noteworthy in the painting department are the interiors by Jessica Hayllar, especially "Castle Priory," in which patterns of all kinds swarm over curtains, wallpaper and Oriental porcelains. She is also represented by the head of a woman beautifully painted in oil on paper. Hayllar's sisters -- Edith, Kate and Mary -- had the same gift for scrupulous realism, particularly Mary in a scene of a woman seated with her dog at a tea table beside a window overlooking fields and trees. But the most impressive painting of all is the profile of a mulatto woman done by Joanna Boyce Wells in 1861, the year in which she died at the age of 30. She is a real loss to art history.
Of special interest is Rebecca Solomon's image of a dark-haired governess dressed in black who minds a small boy while her mistress, a blonde in pink, is at the piano entertaining an admirer. The intensity with which the scene is rendered suggests that the artist knew all about gentlemen preferring blondes. Incidentally, her brother, Simeon, enjoyed success with paintings and wood engravings of Biblical themes until, like Oscar Wilde, he was martyred for his homosexuality. His life shattered, Solomon more or less disappeared from view to scratch out an occasional living as a pavement artist and, despite the concern of friends like Dante Gabriel Rossetti and other Pre-Raphaelites, he wound up in the workhouse. The catalogue hints that his sister's life also ended tragically.
Surprisingly enough, members the English royal family do quite well as artists. Princess Helena, Queen Victoria's third daughter, is represented with a watercolor of two women conversing, one of them on horseback, and Princess Victoria, the Queen's firstborn, with a profile of Helena in pencil and chalk and a still life of oversized fruit in oil.
Kate Greenaway is also on board, but mostly with reproductions of her children's book illustrations. Beatrix Potter addicts should have no trouble spotting her pencil drawings of rabbits (one cleaning itself, two picking apples), but they may be shocked by Ms. Casteras's view of Potter's animal characters as "surrogate children in their anthropomorphized and infantile behavior." Peter Rabbit -- infantile? Potter herself, though successful, did her share of suffering in childhood -- from loneliness and a surfeit of lamb cutlets. But it is worth noting that, upon getting married in later life, she abandoned art for the breeding of sheep, apparently without regret.
The show also covers writers from Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell to George Eliot and from Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Harriet Martineau, the author of "Illustrations of Political Economy.
"A Struggle for Fame," through May 8, Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Tax Rollbacks for 'Paper' Subdivisions on Farmland

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THREE months from now, in July, Samuel and Ruth Paletsky of Morris will be getting some money back -- $24,222. It's a refund on their 1991 and 1992 property-tax payments.
Samuel's brother, Bernard, and his wife, Mildred, will get a refund of $3,391. James and Beatrice Greaves are getting $5,747. Andrew Anderson awaits $1,986. Computations for the refund due Abdullah El-Hachem, an absentee landowner from Nigeria, have not yet been completed. 
 The Town of Morris, with 2,000 residents in 18 square miles of Litchfield County's rural countryside, got into the embarrassing position of overcharging by upholding its assessor's interpretation of Connecticut Public Act 490. This 1963 law allows farmland, forests and other open space to be taxed at 10 percent of the local property tax rate. At least 150 of the state's 169 towns, including Morris, have adopted the legislation, and other states have similar laws.
The trouble in Morris began after a revaluation in 1991. The assessor, Harold Maddocks, noticed that the five farmland owners now due for a refund had at various times filed for subdivisions on portions of their property. He ruled that those portions should be fully taxed, even though the lots had not been sold or developed and their use had not been changed.
That meant that Mr. Paletsky would owe $16,000 rather than $3,500. The others were not hit quite so hard because they had filed for much smaller parcels.
The First Selectman, Philip Birkett Jr., backed Mr. Maddocks, as did most of some 270 townspeople who attended four public meetings in which the farmers tried to have the assessor removed and a board of assessors elected in his place.
In August 1992 the five farmers sued the town in State Superior Court in Litchfield. Judge Walter M. Pickett Jr. accepted their charge of unlawful assessment and allowed a year in which the parties could settle matters among themselves. Failing that, he would set a trial date.
Neither side would budge, so the first of what was to be five trials was held early last month.
After Judge Pickett heard testimony in the Greaves case in court, said Michael Rybak, a lawyer with the firm of Guion, Stevens and Rybak of Litchfield who defended the town in the lawsuits, "he told us in chambers how he was inclined to rule, leaving no doubt that he would have ruled against the town."
"He felt that the filing of a subdivision map alone did not constitute a change of use," said Mr. Rybak.
The remaining cases were settled in negotiation by the Board of Selectmen and the lawyers. "It was a question of spending more money on an appeal or waiting until the facts or the law changes," said Mr. Rybak.
Taxes computed for 1993 are not due until July 1 of this year and will not include the larger amount.
But, noted Peter Litwin, of the Litwin and Kleeman law firm in Litchfield, who represented the plaintiffs, the settlements have "no precedential value."
"It was not a judgment of the court," he said, "but the court's favorable attitude makes it unlikely that without changes in the legislation assessors would not again take this position on the subject of paper subdivisions."
Selectman Birkett now plans to turn to the Legislature for help. "We want anything that can be taxed fairly and equitably in the community to be taxed," said Mr. Birkett. He believes that subdivisions are made for the sole purpose of development, and subdivided land will bring 10 times Public Act 490 taxes.
Mr. Maddocks, the assessor, has retired after some three years with the town and a 30-year history as an assessor in elsewhere.
"IT was my determination that I was following appropriate procedures indicated by the law," he said. "All towns need additional revenues." Morris, he added "never runs a deficit."
Mr. Birkett's co-Selectmen -- fellow-Republican Edward Dorset and Arnold Bohanon, a Democrat -- are in agreement on approaching their legislators, although Mr. Bohanon emphasized that his main concern was "to have the law clarified."
"I don't want to see the farmers forced out of here," he said. "I want the land preserved, and I was pleased with the settlement."
Adela Eads, State Senator from Morris, and Robert A. Maddox Jr., the State Representative, both Republicans, have not yet heard from Mr. Birkett, but Mr. Maddox observed that "every year we have bills on 490 but nothing has passed to change it substantially."
"Those of us in rural districts," said Senator Eads, "want to see 490 continued. Some people feel that other people use it unfairly to reduce their taxes, and of course any way a town can get money it's likely to try."
"If the use of the lots changes in any way, if they list them for sale, sell them as building lots, stop cutting hay three times a year as they do now, the town will look at them differently," Mr. Rybak said.
Figures on the ultimate cost of the proceedings to the town of Morris have not been compiled, but estimates range widely according to various town officials, from $20,000 to $70,000. The plaintiffs will pay anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 each, depending on technicalities in individual cases. Some plaintiffs will pay more than they receive in refunds, but they will save large sums on taxes in the long term, and they are secure in the knowledge that they will not be forced off their land.
"Preserving the land by helping to prevent conversion to development, which is the purpose of 490, is important to the state," said Marcia Standish, municipal assessment adviser at the Office of Policy and Management in Hartford. The agency updates the value of farmland every five years, thus setting guidelines for taxing 490 land.
Since 1982 the amount of farmland in Connecticut has decreased from 444,242 acres to 370,000 acres in 1993, according to the State Department of Agriculture. Large dairy farms, like Samuel Paletsky's 190 acres, his brother's 150 acres and the Andersons' 247 acres, are the most threatened because they are so desirable to developers.
While there has been little development during the recession, as the economy improves owners of large farms will again be besieged with offers that are hard to refuse.
"FOR centuries farmers have used their farms as banks," said George Malia, appraiser with the Southern New England Farm Credit Bureau in Litchfield. "When farmers needed money they sold a piece of land. They never sold the whole farm, just enough to save the rest.
"Their land, whether it's used for haying or grazing or growing corn or tobacco is not taking any services from the town. It produces no children going to school, no sewer hookups. Farm folk in the state watched this trial very closely. It could have shaken up their lives considerably."
According to Walter Welz, spokesman for the Connecticut Farm Bureau in Windsor, "subdivided lots are sometimes never sold."
"The plaintiffs in Morris could have made a killing selling off land during the 80's, but they didn't," he said. "Why should they be taxed on money they haven't made yet and may never make?"
Samuel Paletsky, who is 86 years old, subdivided 30 acres in 1977, two years before Morris adopted zoning regulations. He bought the original farm in 1938, adding to it in 1951.
"He sold off a 3-acre piece and a 12-acre piece in 1956 and 1961," said his son David, who operates a real estate business in town. "This case was a total waste of the taxpayers' money." he added.

HEADLINE: Jockeying for Long-Held Political Terrain

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON 

 BODY:
THE first evidence of a stirring in the political terrain of the normally serene Hudson Valley region came only three weeks ago when a Republican State Senator, George E. Pataki, formally announced that he intended to challenge Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in this year's election.
This prompted two elected officials and a previous officeholder to begin thinking in terms of replacing Senator Pataki, assuming he would give up his 37th Senate District seat if he survived the Republican primary in September. 
 But then came an aftershock at least as powerful as the Pataki jolt, an announcement by Hamilton Fish Jr., the 13-term United States Republican Representative and member of a distinguished political family with roots to the country's founding. He said he would not be seeking re-election because of cancer.
This produced another cluster of tremors in the form of six potential candidates for Mr. Fish's seat, which includes the northern half of Westchester County, all of Putnam County and small parts of Dutchess and Orange Counties.
Nobody believes the political landscape will remain tranquil, with a half-dozen additional names being mentioned for one or more of the seats, and because some of the potential challengers are officeholders, any success on their part would leave other elected posts unfilled.
The three, so far, who are considering the Pataki Senate post are former County Executive Alfred B. DelBello, a Democrat from Lewisboro who practices law in White Plains; Assemblyman Vincent L. Leibell, a Republican from Carmel in Putnam County, and Timothy S. Carey, a Republican member of the County Board of Legislators.
Mr. DelBello's decision to seek the Senate seat, which includes northern Westchester County, all of Putnam County and part of Dutchess County, puzzled some experienced politicians who saw him as a better candidate for the Congressional post. His extensive public service, from Mayor of Yonkers to Lieutenant Governor under Mr. Cuomo, gave him experience and recognition unmatched by any potential opponents.
But Mr. DelBello said, "My interest is in state issues -- education, the economy, Medicaid reform, welfare reform, and, in any case, I like the Senate and am familiar with it." As Lieutenant Governor in the Cuomo administration he presided over that chamber from 1983 to 1985.
Mr. DelBello is also identified with several Hudson Valley planning groups he helped establish in his eight years as County Executive, particularly the Mid-Hudson Health Planning Region, formed around the Westchester Medical Center to serve seven counties.
Two Republican officeholders, Assemblyman Vincent L. Leibell 3d of Patterson and County Legislator Timothy S. Carey of Montrose, have also expressed interest in Mr. Pataki's Senate seat, assuming that he relinquishes it.
Mr. Carey, a close political associate of Mr. Pataki's and the architect of his victory over the seven-term Republican State Senator Mary Goodhue in 1992, said, "We who support George have to give him as much room as possible to run for Governor." He said he would wait for the state Republican convention in late May, a week before the county convention, before making his move.
There is one exception, however. "If Vinny Leibell says he is in the Senate race, then I'm in right after," Mr. Carey said. He said that he could not afford to leave fund raising to a political rival in a campaign that might require $750,000 to finance.
More crowded, and more complex, is the race for the Congressional District, one with a heavy Republican registration. The 93,000 Democrats and 2,300 Liberals represent only 31 percent of registered voters. The 115,000 Republicans and 7,500 Conservatives represent 40 percent. There are 88,000 unaffiliated voters, or independents, representing 29 percent.
 
Lobbyist in Albany
 Representative Fish has represented the district for nearly three decades, but the redistricting that resulted from the 1990 census brought a profound change in the district's shape. It made the Westchester portion 50 percent, and as a result the Fish pluralities of 75 percent to 80 percent dropped to 60 percent, still a wide margin but one that Democrats feel is challengeable, especially as an "open" seat.
First to enter this year's contest was Guy Parisi of Chappaqua, a lawyer long associated with the Republican Party's county leadership. Mr. Parisi also served as counsel to the Board of Legislators for a decade ending in 1990 and since then has been the Board's lobbyist in Albany.
Mr. Parisi's early candidacy, expressed in terms of challenging the venerable lawmaker in a primary, surprised some observers. "I sensed that Fish was going to retire, although I had no idea he was in ill health," Mr. Parisi said. "I thought there was a sense that people felt a quarter of a century in office was long enough."
Mr. Parisi has the support of Anthony J. Colavita, the Republican Party county chairman, who has declined to back Mr. Pataki in his bid for the gubernatorial candidacy. Mr. Pataki had been put forward by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Mr. Colavita instead supported Herbert London, a New York University professor who has the support of Ralph Marino, the State Senate Majority Leader.
Another Republican seeking the Congressional seat is John F. Flanagan Jr., a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve who ran briefly in 1992 against Representative Nita M. Lowey, the Democratic incumbent whose district was redrawn that year to include a heavily Democratic bulge in Queens.
"I stayed in the race for three weeks, or long enough time to see what the preponderance of Democrats would mean," Mr. Flanagan said. He said he would bring greater perspective to the Congressional post being abandoned by Representative Fish.
 
Some Early Political Experience
 Born in Peekskill, he had some early political experience, accompanying his father, who was clerk to the Putnam County Board of Supervisors, distributing leaflets. Mr. Flanagan is currently a professor at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and at the Staten Island campus of St. John's University.
He has appeared before executive committees of county Republican organizations but says "the party should avoid making premature endorsements until the people have had a chance to choose a candidate in a primary."
The Democrats, delighted by the prospect of an empty seat and undaunted by the heavy Republican registration in the 19th Congressional District, are providing an interesting slate of candidates, with possibly more to come.
Dennis Mehiel, the former County Democratic Party chairman, entered the race a week before Mr. Fish's announcement, prompting him to say, "I had spent three months trying to figure out how to unseat Ham Fish; now I have to concentrate on how to capture the seat."
Mr. Mehiel, who quit his post as party chairman to make the race, had an earlier try at a Congressional post, but lost in a three-way Democratic primary to Ms. Lowey in 1988, who then won a narrow victory over the incumbent Republican, Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi, for the 20th Congressional District.
Mr. Mehiel hopes his political and business experience will win the nomination. With his brother, he founded the Four M Corporation in 1966. It is the country's largest independent maker of corrugated packaging and employs 1,800 workers in 21 plants nationwide.
An even earlier entrant in the race, Al Lynn of Pound Ridge, has a business background that he says is suited to the work of a Congressman. A Bronx native who began work as a New York City Welfare Department caseworker after graduating from Hunter College, he soon became a supervisor.
He worked in two New Jersey banks as personnel officer and director of human resources, then founded A-L Associates, a concern that expanded to Manhattan, Washington, Los Angeles and Tokyo. With a professional staff of more than 100 and annual revenues of $25 million, he branched into home health care.
His Medlinc Inc., has 14 offices in the New York City area, employing more than 5,000. Medlinc has since merged with Lifetime Inc., the country's largest provider of home-care services.
Mr. Lynn has no political experience, but doesn't think he needs it. "The people of the Hudson River Valley are hurting; many are out of work, and many share a cynicism about the political process," he said. His political aide, Martha-Lee Bohn, said, "He may not have name recognition, but he comes across as a self-made man with experience in starting a small business and expertise in home health care and job placement."
Neil McCarthy not only has political experience but he was also the last Democrat to run against Mr. Fish, in 1992. And he has already learned something about the difference: "When you are running against an incumbent, the chances of getting substantial financial support are minimal. I raised $150,000, while Fish spent $600,000. Thus, with no incumbent, it should be much less difficult to raise money."
 
Law Practice in Albany
 Mr. McCarthy sees considerable discontent in the valley. "There's a white-collar depression, and people in the district are really scared. Republicans may have the edge in voter registration, but I think we can compete, especially with the economic problems that dominate people's thinking."
The 38-year-old Democrat practices law in Albany and Westchester. He had worked as an Assistant United States Attorney in New Hampshire and then practiced as an lawyer for a Manhattan law firm, a job he left to devote full time to the campaign against Mr. Fish in 1992.
There will, in fact, probably be a Hamilton Fish in the 19th Congressional District race this year, but he will be the Congressman's son, a Democrat who has already made an effort to win a Congressional seat, losing in the 1988 primary that also saw Mr. Mehiel succumb to the eventual winner, Ms. Lowey.
Mr. Fish, who assisted his father last weekend as he was admitted to a hospital, said he intended to wait until his father's condition was clear before deciding whether he would join the crowd vying for Representative Fish's post.

JOYCE SERIES
Joyceans, rejoice! A four-part discussion series about James Joyce, the Irish author whose works continue to provoke ire and admiration in almost equal measure, will begin Friday at 10:30 A.M. at Manhattanville College in Purchase.
Led by Eileen O'Gorman, professor emeritus of English at the college, the sessions will continue on successive Friday mornings, covering Joyce's influence on 20th-century novelists, his inner torments as an Irish Catholic, his self-imposed exile on the Continent and the well-known day in the life of Leopold Bloom (the central figure in "Ulysses"), which took place in Dublin on June 16, 1904. Published in Paris in 1922, the book was banned in the United States as obscene until 1933. 
 The series will be held in Barat House on the campus at 2900 Purchase Street, and the fee is $35. Individual sessions may be attended for $10, lunch included. Call 694-3425 or 694-3389 for reservations or more information.
 
REFINISHING SCHOOL
 The art of finishing or refinishing fine furniture will be taught on Saturday in four one-hour workshops by Waclaw Godziemba-Maliszewski, sponsored by the Pound Ridge Historical Society.
Scheduled at 9:30 and 11 A.M. and 1 and 2:30 P.M., the sessions will be held at Mr. Maliszewski's restoration shop, London Joiners, on Route 124 in Pound Ridge. Mr. Maliszewski said he encourages women as well as men to learn the craft for fun and profit.
In each session he will demonstrate wax polishing and French and Italian polishing, compare their merits and put them in historical perspective.
The ancient Egyptians were the first to burnish wooden surfaces by waxing -- rubbing them with layer after layer of lac, a resinous, shellac-like or lacquer-like substance made by bees, other bugs and some plants.
The process was refined by the French in the 18th century, when mentholated spirits were added as a solvent and quick-drying binder. The Italians perfected a method combining mineral oil with concentrated lac flakes, providing a barrier against oxygen.
The discussion will extend to marquetry, parquet, inlay, joinery and gold leaf. Each workshop is limited to 10 people and costs $10. Call 764-4538 to register or obtain more information.
 
HALLE'S HOUSES
 Hiram Halle, after whom the Pound Ridge Library is named, died in 1944 after restoring about 30 Colonial houses, creating a preservation core by sometimes moving the houses to a central location. The Pound Ridge Historical Society has mounted an exhibition honoring his efforts, called "The Houses of Halle," to remain on view through Aug. 15.
Six of the renovated buildings, some of them listed on the State and Federal Historic Registers, are documented in vintage and updated photographs, blueprints, sketches and artifacts, while the entire collection is on a topographical map. The museum, at the junction of Routes 172 and 137, is open Saturdays and Sundays from 2 to 4 P.M. Admission is free, but contributions are welcome. Call 764-4333 for more information.
 
'SNOW WHITE' MINUS 6
 The Kids' Theater of Mount Kisco has created an audience-participation musical based on a Brothers Grimm fairy tale. It follows most of the elements in the story, but with a marked difference exemplified by the title, "Snow White and the One Dwarf!?!"
It is left to the audience, led by the performers, to find the six missing dwarfs before a happy ending can be achieved.
Christopher Rich composed the music and lyrics and Missy Slaymaker wrote the book. They are the theater's directors as well as instructors at the Dance, Drama and Song Performing Arts School in Bedford Hills.
Performances are on Saturdays at 11 A.M. and 1:30 P.M. through April 30 and on Sunday, April 17, at 1 and 3:30 P.M. in the Manufacturers Outlet Center, second floor, Route 117 in Mount Kisco. Tickets at $6 are available by calling 666-0223, or 15 minutes before showtime at the door.
 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
 Strategies for local businesses and municipalities to participate in international economic development will be addressed by Leslie H. Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, on Wednesday at 6:30 P.M. at the Ramada Inn in New Rochelle. The evening, which begins with a cocktail reception, was organized by the New Rochelle Overall Economic Development Corporation.
Mr. Gelb grew up in New Rochelle and received his master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard University. A career in journalism earned him a Pulitzer Prize and a Front Page Award, and from 1977 to 1979 he was Assistant Secretary of State.
He will discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement, the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade and the current impasse on trade between the United States and Japan.
For reservations, call (212) 759-3300, extension 315. A contribution of $7.50 will be requested for admission.
 
A CAPPELLA CONCERT
 An exuberant group of 13 young men and 17 young women from Amherst College in Massachusetts will give a concert on Friday at 8 P.M. in the Scarsdale Congregational Church, 1 Heathcote Road.
The men's group, founded in 1927, is called Double Quartet in spite of its numbers, and the women's group, which began in 1989, is named Bluestockings for some 19th-century Englishwomen who met to discuss politics and literature. The two groups will sing together and separately. The program, which is all performed a cappella, ranges from the classics to 1920's jazz, doo-wop, rock-and-roll, college songs and pop tunes from the last two decades.
Tickets are $10; $5 for students and people 65 and older. Proceeds will aid the Deer Hills Conference Center, a nonprofit, interfaith retreat in Wappingers Falls. Call 725-1643 for more information or reservations.
 
GARDENING CLASSES
 Growing and using herbs, selecting colorful woody plants, soil preparation, seed sowing, ornamental grasses, renewing an old garden, dealing with deer and designing a perennial border are among the subjects to be discussed by master gardeners at the Fourth Annual Spring Gardening School of the Cornell Cooperative Extension Center in White Plains.
The classes will be offered on Saturday from 9:30 A.M. to 3 P.M., with participants permitted to choose four out of eight classes.
The fee will be $20 and includes educational material to take home. Participants should take a lunch; beverages will be provided.
Advance registration is recommended, but there will be a registration period on Saturday at 9 A.M. for any classes not filled. The center is at 214 Central Avenue, and the phone number for registering or obtaining more information is 285-4640.
 
SQUARE DANCING
 The Loft, a Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in White Plains, has scheduled an evening of square, two-step and line dancing on Saturday at 7 P.M. at the South Presbyterian Church, 343 Broadway in Dobbs Ferry.
The session will last about four hours. Admission will be $10, with food and soft drinks available for purchase. Proceeds will go to the Loft's building fund. For more information, call 948-4922. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: A Wall St. Star's Agonizing Confession

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR with ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
Larry Kudlow seemed a master of the universe. Being a top Wall Street economist was not the half of it. Mr. Kudlow had been a prominent member of President Reagan's economic team. He helped conceive and fight for the tax-cut proposal that helped Christine Todd Whitman become Governor of New Jersey. One of the nation's most articulate and charismatic commentators on financial issues, he has become the economic guru of Jack Kemp and of the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, as well as a regular on television interview programs and a speaker commanding hefty fees. He even starred in Cadillac ads.
To hear some leading Republicans, the 46-year-old Mr. Kudlow has nowhere to go but up. They consider him a hot political property, a potential challenger for the Senate seat of Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York or, should a right-leaning Republican like Mr. Kemp win the White House in 1996, a shoo-in for a Cabinet position. John Sweeney, executive director of the New York State Republican Committee, last week called him "one of the brightest stars." 
 But last week, in an interview, Larry Kudlow had a confession to make: behind the polished facade lived a troubled and deeply unhappy man who has been battling an addiction to drugs and alcohol.
Swiveling in his chair in the offices of his new employer, National Review magazine, Mr. Kudlow lighted yet another Merit Ultra Light and began an explanation that many others would not summon the courage to make: Fifteen months ago he took a four-week medical leave of absence from his Wall Street firm, Bear Stearns.
"I went into drug rehab," Mr. Kudlow said, deciding to discuss his problem after being told he was the subject of a profile. "I had an alcohol and substance-abuse problem that needed to be taken care of."
He said that for 15 months he has been attending twice daily a self-help program for recovering addicts.
"I am willing to share with you my problem," he said, following the example of many people in programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. "Anyone who blames Bear Stearns is not right. I take full personal responsibility."
Then this dapper man in a blue pinstripe shirt and monogrammed cufflinks, a man sometimes described as poker-faced, began to cry. Sounding scared, not at all like the suave raconteur and deft name dropper of two hours earlier, Mr. Kudlow said he lived in fear of sliding backward. "I live my life day to day," he said.
Mr. Kudlow said he was talking largely because he wanted to be honest and because his story might benefit other families with alcohol and drug problems. "I'm on top of this thing, God bless," he said. "Maybe somebody reading about this somewhere will be helped."
Mr. Kudlow is still striving to understand what drove him to depend on drugs and alcohol, and the elaborate lying and dodging that are required to conceal such habits from friends, family and colleagues. Whatever the reasons, it is clear that there are many Larry Kudlows. One in 10 Americans has some form of alcohol or drug-abuse problem, recent studies show. America's success-conscious society is full of people who are less afraid to snort a line or put away a fifth than they are of letting someone else see that they are not all they appear to be. Everyone knows someone talented, ambitious and magnetic who has a serious problem but chooses to ignore it for a long time, hoping that other people will look the other way too because he's so valuable.
Several people inside and outside Bear Stearns say Mr. Kudlow used cocaine. Mr. Kudlow refused to say what drug he used or to be specific about how his drug use began. He did say that he began drinking regularly in the second half of 1970's and that his drinking led to drugs.
Mr. Kudlow attributes his slide partly to pure pressure. On Wall Street there are producers and then there's everyone else, and the pressure to produce helped drive Mr. Kudlow to drink and drugs.
Then there was the exhausting travel and entertaining. "You think you're a superman, you think you can do anything," he said. "I felt invincible and that there were no limits as to how late I could stay up or how much I could travel. Today, I can see how tough it was."
There was also the easy availability and acceptability of alcohol and drugs, especially in the 1980's, combined with having plenty of money to throw around. And he had no children to ground him.
Another problem was that when he felt down, he didn't know how to turn to a friend. He described himself, for all his gregariousness and bonhomie, as a man who spent much of his life isolated, ashamed to let others know him well enough to share his failings and embarrassments along with the successes.
"I never had any friends beyond a certain superficial level," he said. "We hate to admit weaknesses. We were raised to want to get ahead, to be good and clever and successful. You're just ashamed to open up."
John C. Glidden Jr. described his longtime friend this way: "There's a searching for approval, for acceptance. You can trace it right back to high school. His father and my father were a lot alike. They both set high standards for their sons."
 
The Early Years
From the S.D.S. To Wall Street
 Lawrence A. Kudlow was an early Baby Boomer, born in the summer of 1947. He grew up in Englewood, a northern New Jersey suburb with many upwardly mobile families. He was one of a couple of Jewish boys at a private school called the Englewood School for Boys, a tennis star, editor of the student newspaper, an actor in school plays. The family owned a textile business, worked hard for Republican causes and frequently replaced the Jaguar in the driveway with a new model.
Had it not been for the Vietnam War, Mr. Kudlow's years in the University of Rochester's class of 1969 might have been best remembered for his star performance on the tennis team. But at some point Mr. Kudlow, a history major, traded in his Porsche for a VW bus, let his hair turn "fuzzy" and joined the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society. Asthma saved him from the draft.
What distinguished his brief career as a radical and antiwar organizer was less what he accomplished than that he managed to have it chronicled by The New Yorker magazine in a piece about the leaders of a nationwide protest in 1969. That was an early sign of Mr. Kudlow's gift for attracting media interest.
Indeed, Larry Kudlow has always had a knack for reinventing himself to adapt to the times, and the persuasiveness to make others follow him.
Some people dismiss Mr. Kudlow as an ideologue. Others find him slick, shallow, overly opportunistic. And true, to paint himself in the best possible light, he has been known to edit and embellish the facts of his life as reflexively as most people clear their throats. A fellow conservative, the columnist Jude Wanniski, described him as "a swashbuckler, a car salesman, a gunslinger."
But even most of Mr. Kudlow's critics find him hard to dislike, and he has many admirers. Sophisticated, funny, slightly outrageous, always ready with a sound bite, Mr. Kudlow exudes both confidence and vulnerability. Many people cite his generosity and loyalty. His interest in politics and ideas is infectious. "He's noted for not being a sycophant," said another old friend and political ally, the economist Arthur Laffer. "I've never heard him pull punches because he was worried about his audience's reaction."
As the war wound down, Mr. Kudlow studied politics and some economics in graduate school at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. He left without collecting a master's degree, though a recent resume dances around that. His first full-time job was as a junior economist at the New York Federal Reserve, a time-honored launching pad for a Wall Street career in economics.
In 1974, in yet another brush with The New Yorker, Mr. Kudlow married Nancy Gerstein, an editor in the magazine's fiction department and the first of three wives. The marriage lasted about a year.
The next year, Mr. Kudlow jumped from the Fed to Fed watching on Wall Street. At the age of 28, with no degree in economics, he became the chief economist of one of the nation's biggest brokerages, Paine Webber, doubling his salary in the process. Quotes from Mr. Kudlow, sometimes coupled with a description of him as a maverick, began to appear regularly in the financial press.
While he had no extensive formal training in economics, he had an innate understanding of how markets worked and was comfortable with numbers. And he worked hard to teach himself.
Mr. Kudlow says he made his name in the late 1970's in good part by correctly taking a far more bearish position on interest rates and inflation than the consensus on Wall Street. By 1979, the 32-year-old Mr. Kudlow had moved to Bear Stearns, a very prosperous upstart firm that liked his outspoken free-market ideas, as chief economist.
Mr. Kudlow says he can't pinpoint when his social drinking turned into a habit on which he depended, but he did begin drinking regularly at home alone or on the road by the late 1970's, when he was making a name for himself. And, as is the case for many people, "Alcohol was the gate-opener to everything else," Mr. Kudlow said.
"If you go out with clients in any business, you have a round of drinks and you say big deal," he said. "And that's how it starts."
Once he got used to loosening himself up with a drink before dinner, he said, it was hard to resist other temptations young professionals of his generation faced frequently. "Recreational drugs -- until recently that stuff was acceptable," he said.
Shortly after the 1980 election, Mr. Kudlow, who was becoming increasingly interested in conservative economic ideas, was drafted into the ranks of Ronald Reagan's revolutionaries -- an experience again chronicled in The New Yorker in a 1982 article about Reaganomics.
One day David Stockman, the President's newly appointed budget director, and a caravan of "supply siders" -- dedicated to lowering tax rates to stimulate economic growth by encouraging thrift and work -- came to see him on Wall Street. In his book "The Triumph of Politics," Mr. Stockman recalls being impressed by Mr. Kudlow, who was worried about deficits and called for steeper cuts in government spending as well as tax cuts. "Here, I realized, was a fellow traveler," Mr. Stockman wrote.
A newcomer at Bear Stearns, Mr. Kudlow made the most of his exalted guests. "I called up one of the big shots at Bear and said, 'I've got Dave Stockman here and Jack Kemp,' then a Congressman. 'Do we want to do anything?' " Soon, Bear Stearns's partners were raising sherry glasses to the Reaganites in the private dining room. Mr. Kudlow said he was quickly invited to become a partner. But two weeks later, he was on his way to Washington.
From the start, Mr. Kudlow, chief economist of the Office of Management and Budget and effectively Mr. Stockman's No. 2 man, was at the center of the action.
During this time Mr. Kudlow remarried; his bride was Susan Cullman, the granddaughter of a Bloomingdale. The Washington wedding was presided over by John Sirica, the renowned Federal judge.
 
The Ascent
A Rise to Fame At Bear Stearns
 By the end of 1983, the economy was roaring back, the Federal deficit was mushrooming and Mr. Stockman had lost most of his influence after The Atlantic magazine quoted him as calling the Reagan tax cuts a "Trojan horse." Mr. Kudlow bailed out.
He decided to start a Washington consulting firm. But after a couple of years he had grown weary of that. And by 1985 his second marriage had fallen apart.
Time to go back to Wall Street and to the Bear. "He had a very expensive career in Washington," said Lee J. Seidler, a former partner of Bear Stearns, referring to the fact that Mr. Kudlow would have made millions if he had still been with the firm when it went public just before his return.
Mr. Kudlow asked his new girlfriend, Judy Pond, later his third wife, to join him. Mr. Kudlow calls her "the love of my life."
Bear Stearns welcomed Mr. Kudlow back in his old job of chief economist, but his life there was different this time.
He was promoted to senior managing director, one of 200 or so in a firm that had mushroomed in his absence to 7,000 employees from 1,000. He was also named the chairman of the investment policy committee, which determines the recommendations the firm makes to its clients.
Chief economists predict the course of the economy, interest rates, prices and the dollar. But they are, first and foremost, salespeople expected to help attract clients.
Mr. Kudlow did it well. "Larry was an outstanding rhetorician, a very good speaker, very clear," said Brian Barish, head of emerging-markets research at Lazard Freres who worked in Bear's research department. He added: "If there was any person I tried to model my own public speaking after, it was Larry."
Mr. Kudlow's forecasting record, while far from perfect, has been relatively strong. For example, he correctly anticipated the timing of both the 1990-91 recession and the subsequent recovery. Increasingly, he appeared on television programs, from Larry King to MacNeil/Lehrer. The most controversial appearances were in broadcast and print ads for Cadillac for which Mr. Kudlow received, among other things, a one-year lease on a red 1993 Cadillac Seville. (The firm's chairman, Alan C. Greenberg, used to joke, "If Larry can turn G.M. around, more power to him.")
But the pressure on Mr. Kudlow was incredible. The travel, report writing and speeches were becoming increasingly burdensome. "It got tougher," he said. "It was all bigger. You're stressed out. You're tired. You realize you may not be able to do this anymore. It creeps up on you."
 
The Descent
A Hard Time Saying No
 As he tells it, Mr. Kudlow hid his problems well. Tim Kearney, an economist at Fidelity who worked with Mr. Kudlow, recalls that he never saw Mr. Kudlow other than "in complete command of himself."
But colleagues did notice that Mr. Kudlow was losing weight. And an investment banker at Bear Stearns said that Mr. Kudlow was not very dependable. "There's been a lot of last-minute cancellations. After a while there was a certain exasperation level."
"People always wanted to know, where is Larry?" he added.
Mr. Kudlow's personal problems worsened in 1992. "All of a sudden I could not face the three-day road trips," he said. "The two or three plane flights in a day. I was having trouble facing it. I was dreading it."
"So here I am in Salt Lake City, Indianapolis, Chicago, Paris, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires, Budapest. Not only am I tired, dragging my feet, but I've got responsibility and the show's gotta go on."
On top of the demands of the firm and its clients, Mr. Kudlow had a full plate of extracurricular activities. "If the producer of 'Cross-Fire' called me to go that night to Washington, I'd go," he said. "If Jack Kemp called, I'd go."
"I'm a person who has a hard time saying no and it gets me into trouble because I sometimes overreach."
It was on the road -- at client dinners, and later at the hotel -- where Mr. Kudlow lost control. "I'll give you an example," he said. "One drink over dinner turns into two and pretty soon your problem becomes a bigger problem."
Mr. Kudlow said no one at the firm complained about his performance at the time. "No one at the firm ever found . . . ," he said, stopping himself and reformulating the thought. "Ironically, the last few years have been the best performance years for me. My ratings in the I.I. polls" -- a reference to the magazine Institutional Investor. "I was second in bonds, third in stocks. I published more op-ed pieces and was more productive."
But "my personal life was getting bumped," he added. "I valued my marriage." By autumn 1992, things were spiraling out of control.
Judy Kudlow, now a painter of flowers and landscapes, says that it was her husband who decided that he had to act. "He's the one who knew he needed to get help," she said. "And I was behind him. I was aware that he had a problem. We're devoted to each other. We did it together, but he is the one leading the way."
In mid-December 1992 Mr. Kudlow and his wife met with the firm's chairman, Mr. Greenberg. Mr. Kudlow asked for, and received, a leave of absence in order to enter a treatment program.
The treatment program involved spiritual counseling, introspection and group therapy. Since his release, Mr. Kudlow has been attending a self-help program for recovering addicts -- as often as every morning before work and every evening after work -- where people, some of whom have been sober for years, help each other struggle with their demons.
He said the firm had not made him submit to extraordinary supervision or drug testing. "They were generous and kind," Mr. Kudlow said.
Mr. Kudlow didn't miss a beat when he returned toward the end of January last year. Around that time, Christine Todd Whitman came to Mr. Kudlow for advice at the urging of their mutual friend, Forbes magazine's publisher, Steve Forbes Jr. Armed with facts showing that New Jersey's economy had become hopelessly noncompetitive, Mr. Kudlow argued for a state version of the original Reagan tax-cut plan.
Ten months later, Mr. Kudlow stood behind Mrs. Whitman, in full view of the camera, as she proclaimed her upset victory over Jim Florio in the governor's race.
 
The Resignation
A Missed Meeting And Many Rumors
 Then this year, on Tuesday, March 1, Mr. Kudlow was scheduled to speak to a large group of institutional investors in Boston. Two hundred people turned up for lunch at the Hotel Meridien. But Mr. Kudlow, the featured speaker, failed to show.
Given Mr. Kudlow's recent troubles, a lot of people at Bear Stearns and on Wall Street were suspicious. But Mr. Kudlow said last week: "I was sick. It was not a relapse. I know there were rumors."
Why would he not have called to say he didn't feel well and wasn't coming? "Unfortunately, there was a communications gap," he said. "I wish I could make amends to every person who was there. That was not the reason for the resignation."
Mr. Kudlow said "the explosion hit" when he went into the office the next day.
"Being unreachable was a fairly high-level sin," said Mr. Seidler, the retired managing director.
Mr. Kudlow handed his resignation to the firm's general counsel that day.The decision was his, Mr. Kudlow said, though the firm made it clear, in an unusual news release, that it felt Mr. Kudlow's departure was also in its best interest. Bear Stearns officials refused to discuss Mr. Kudlow's departure but the firm described it as a "voluntary termination" in mandatory public filings made with securities regulators.
Missing the luncheon, Mr. Kudlow said, "reinforced to me the notion that I needed a less stressful and less energy-consuming job. It's as if you had cancer, or a heart attack, or had your hip replaced. You've got to make changes in order to live a healthy life."
An executive recruiter familiar with the firm said Mr. Greenberg and James E. Cayne, the firm's president, were "heartbroken, really bummed out. They loved him. He brought in huge business. In fact, that he even got a second chance was a testament to how much they liked him."
 
The Rehabilitation
A Run for Office? There's Hope
 Within two days Mr. Kudlow had negotiated a position as economics editor of National Review, for perhaps a tenth of his former income of nearly $1 million. He was soon crowing, "You know, this is a real job," and preparing for tapings of "Firing Line," the television program hosted by his new boss, William F. Buckley.
Mr. Kudlow says that he has been in recovery, the term used by addicts for being free of drugs and alcohol, for more than 15 months. One thing helping him now, he said, is sharing his experiences with younger men and women in the program who are struggling to take the first steps to help themselves.
He has also turned to the spiritual counsel of the Rev. C. John McCloskey, a Roman Catholic priest and a former Wall Streeter who now counsels high-powered people.
Sitting in the couple's Upper East Side apartment, surrounded by richly flowered tapestries and carpets and gleaming Biedermeier chests, Judy Kudlow says: "He is better than he's ever been. He's stronger."
Mr. Kudlow, seated at the polished cherry desk that he brought from Bear Stearns to his new office, said he has put any political plans on hold. But he doesn't rule anything out. Punditry, politics and the lay priesthood -- and more remotely, a return to Wall Street -- are all possibilities.
Can he still make it in politics? The decision by the media-wise Mr. Kudlow, whose wife was once a Reagan press official, to go public with his problems may be the best way to put the problem behind him and preserve some chance.
Indeed, some politicians who admitted such problems have gone on to victory. Ann Richards, one of Mr. Kudlow's idols, became Governor of Texas even after acknowledging she was a recovering alcoholic. Chuck McDonald, a spokesman from her 1990 campaign, said voters might be less forgiving about drugs. But "you can overcome anything if people believe you've changed your ways. He's got to get some time on his side and some years of sobriety under his belt."
Even Robert J. Strang, a hard-nosed private investigator who spent two years undercover on Wall Street looking for drug abusers, gave Mr. Kudlow a chance of a comeback. "Ten years ago, I would have said no," he said. "But today there are enough people in this country who can identify with his story."
Mr. Kudlow certainly hopes so: "In our society there are a lot of people who have suffered from alcohol or substance abuse -- you name it -- and society has been understanding. Listen, I have a lot of faith and a lot of hope."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Stumble for Small-Stock Funds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
THE stock market chugged along nicely in 1994 until mid-March, when the market began a decline that took the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 250 points in two weeks. That knocked the average diversified domestic stock fund from a 3 percent gain as of mid-March to a 3.2 percent loss for the quarter, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.
Hardest hit were the technology stocks, the driving force behind an exceptional showing up to that point in small-capitalization stock funds. Technology stocks still ended the quarter with a gain of seven-tenths percent, while small caps took second place, finishing down 2.9 percent. Overseas investors garnered the quarter's best overall performance, with Japan funds up 18.3 percent -- and the worst, as Pacific region funds dropped 12.3 percent because of a slump in Southeast Asia. 
 Big stocks dominated much of the 1980's, beating mutual fund managers year after year; so marketers created funds to mimic the S.& P. 500. But the tide turned in 1990, and small stocks have had a strong run.
Can it continue?
Yes, said Robert C. Czepiel, who runs the $210 million Robertson Stephens Emerging Growth Fund in San Francisco. "Size and economies of scale were important; now, it's responsiveness to the marketplace," he said.
Robert L. Rodriguez, who runs the $173 million FPA Capital Fund, is one of the group's biggest bears. But he said that while valuations between small- and big-cap stocks are nearly level, "maybe we're only halfway through the cycle, or slightly more," of small-company stocks outperforming the big corporations.
Most of the small-cap managers with the best showings in the period had big technology holdings, but they won in different ways.
Despite the difficult two weeks, Ronald E. Elijah, who runs the $64 million Robertson Stephens Value Plus Fund, is sticking with his tech stocks. "I believe that we're within a week of the market turning around," he said. A third of his fund is devoted to health care, including hospitals (11 percent) and nursing homes (9 percent) as well as H.M.O.'s (13 percent). He likes Columbia Healthcare and two nursing homes, Grancare and Living Centers of America. Semiconductor companies are the second-largest chunk (21 percent). Unlike many managers in this group, he caps the price he will pay for stocks (at 25 times trailing 12-month earnings).
By contrast, Mr. Czepiel, who also rode the strength of the technology sector, shifted gears last week, drastically reducing his position from one third of his portfolio to 6 percent. He's also raising cash to 50 percent, anticipating heavy redemptions as mutual fund investors see the first-quarter results. A third of his portfolio remains in health care because Mr. Czepiel figures the market is independently coming up with solutions to fit the Administration's pursuit of reform. His heaviest concentration is in H.M.O.'s like Health Source, Mid Atlantic Medical Services and Pacificare Health Systems.
The $45 million Pilgrim Baxter Emerging Growth Fund, which turns a year old in June, looks for companies with market capitalizations of less than $250 million, said its manager, Christine M. Baxter. She wants rapidly growing companies and anticipates earnings-per-share growth of 50 percent in the next 12 months. The portfolio is tilted toward technology (39 percent), with heavy holdings in health care (24 percent) and consumer goods (23 percent). The fund's largest holdings are Cyrk, which produces promotional materials; Microchip Technology, which makes chips and semiconductors, and Three Five Systems, which makes display panels.
The 15-month-old $50 million Govett Smaller Companies Fund, however, stays "broadly diversified by industry and company," said its manager, Garrett Van Wagoner. Technology, health care, cyclical and consumer stocks each account for about 20 percent of the 125-stock fund. "Small stocks should continue to do well as the economy does well," he said. Cost-cutting is the theme of his health care investments, which include H.M.O.'s like Wellcare and Mid Atlantic Medical.
The $1.3 billion MFS Emerging Growth Fund is available only through 401(k) plans. John W. Ballen, its manager, said, "We're pretty optimistic that we can find small, rapidly growing companies at reasonable valuations." His biggest industry is entertainment and leisure (24 percent), with companies like Sholodge, a hotel operator, Grand Casinos and Applebee's, a restaurant chain.
John C. Bogle Jr. runs the $69 million Quantitative Boston Numeric Fund, which has a median market capitalization of $800 million, larger than many of these funds because "we buy small or growing companies," he said. Stock picks are based on a computer model that looks at changes in earnings expectations and stock prices, seeking the best combination of value and earnings momentum. The fund, started a year and a half ago, tends to own technology shares (27 percent) and consumer cyclical stocks (25 percent). Because the model is always re-evaluating stocks, the fund's average annual turnover exceeds 200 percent.
That contrasts with FPA Capital, which has held Seagate Technology, its largest position, since 1988. FPA's turnover is less than 20 percent. Mr. Rodriguez sees little value in today's market except in small pockets, like companies with market caps of less than $100 million, and he was a net seller of stocks this year until Wednesday, when he began buying "because of the change in valuations," he said. "It's a pretty healthy correction."

HEADLINE: Investors Who Discovered Africa

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
MORE than 100 years ago, American adventurers in pith helmets roamed Africa, searching for fortune and fame. In 1994, they're back -- but this time they're wearing pinstriped suits. And they are taking investors with them.
Africa, particularly that part of the continent south of the Sahara, has become a hot new target for international investing. In the last two months, brokerage firms in New York have floated three new funds -- and raised more than $350 million -- to invest in southern Africa. And according to Fund Decoder, an industry newsletter, four more funds are in the works, including two that plan to invest across the continent. 
 There is good reason to be hopeful about the long-term investment prospects for many African countries. The coming multiracial elections in South Africa, the abolishment of apartheid and the end of international sanctions bode well not just for that country but for many of its neighbors. Investment experts also point to a variety of factors, from the end of the cold war to signs of improving commodity prices, that may ultimately make Africa the greatest emerging market of them all.
But there are enormous risks for American investors, particularly in the short run. They include political instability, weak currencies, fledgling stock markets and, ironically, the very fact that investing in Africa is becoming such a fad.
"There's more money being raised now than there are stocks in Africa. It can't go on," said James P. Rogers, an investor famous both for his acumen and his adventurousness. From 1990 through 1992, he rode a motorcycle around the world, accompanied for part of his trip by television cameras. Mr. Rogers was an early investor in African stocks, and now has holdings in Ghana, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Zambia, as well as in companies that do business in Nigeria, Kenya and the Ivory Coast.
But he said he will not invest more until the current financial craze has run its course. "This is the dying gasp of the emerging markets thing, and Africa is ringing the bell," Mr. Rogers said, referring to the current mania for investing in what used to be known as less developed countries, and the booms and busts that have been created of late in markets from Malaysia to Peru.
"That is not to say that long term, there isn't true opportunity," Mr. Rogers added. "But short term it could leave investors with a horrible, horrible taste in their mouths for Africa, because they'll get banged around badly."
The allure of Africa is its potential for economic growth that will far surpass that of the industrial nations. A few African countries, including Botswana, Ghana and Kenya, have sustained growth rates of 5 percent a year in their gross national products, said Michel ZhuParris, a portfolio manager for Morgan Stanley Asset Management in New York. That's almost twice last year's growth in the United States.
Many African countries could benefit from the fact that the 10-year bear market in commodities finally seems to be drawing to a close. And some nations have unrecognized manufacturing capabilities, as well as undervalued natural resources. Compared with some other emerging markets, "Africa is definitely starting from a lower base," Ms. ZhuParris said. "But that is where the upside is to be made, if you get in at these levels."
WHAT may unleash growth in Africa are the economic reforms that are sweeping across the continent. Some African nations are rejecting the socialist policies they adopted after colonial rule ended. Others are being pushed to reform because old sources of money, such as payments from rival superpowers, have dried up.
"For me, the most important thing has been the end of the cold war," said Miles Morland of Blakeney Management, a London firm that specializes in emerging markets. Governments are finding it necessary to adopt the reforms demanded by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. "Now that they can no longer play cold-war blackmail, they either eat at the I.M.F.'s table or they don't eat at all. The trend, politically speaking, has been improving for three or four years."
The World Bank says more than half of Africa's countries have economic reform packages in place. But those statistics may well be overly optimistic. For example, they include Zaire, which seems in a state of economic and political collapse under the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko, as well as Nigeria, which is threatening to default on its debt.
But there is a trend to establish stock markets, and to open those markets to foreigners. By Morgan Stanley's count, a dozen African countries already have stock markets, with more on the way. The International Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the World Bank, tracks seven stock markets, of which all but Nigeria's and Kenya's are open to overseas investors.
Much of the new interest in Africa began in South Africa, where the stock market is relatively large and well established. When sanctions were lifted last year, foreigners rushed in. The Johannesburg market, though big, is not very liquid, which means it is difficult to buy stocks without pushing up prices. And that's exactly what happened: In 1993, South African shares rose 26 percent on average, according to Birinyi Associates. That's not much more than London's 22 percent increase, to be sure, but far larger than America's average 7 percent rise or Japan's 2 percent gain.
Other African markets have shown even more spectacular increases, at least in local currencies. Last year, for example, stocks rose 41 percent in Nigeria, 67 percent in Mauritius, 116 percent in Ghana, 117 percent in Kenya and 161 percent in Zimbabwe.
Nevertheless, the stocks remain inexpensive by most measures. According to International Finance Corporation figures, for example, stocks in Mauritius trade for just 12.8 times earnings, and that is the highest multiple on the continent. The stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, by contrast, trade for an average 29 times last year's earnings.
But Africa's emerging markets are far riskier than those of the big developed countries, in part because they are so small. The largest market outside South Africa is in Namibia, with a capitalization of about $2.7 billion. That's about a thousandth the size of the New York Stock Exchange. Ghana's entire market barely tops $100 million, less than the value of I.B.M. shares that change hands on an average morning. Mauritius, one of the oldest and most established stock markets, is open just three days a week, for an hour before lunch. Only 30 companies are listed.
All that is a problem because too many American dollars can end up chasing too few foreign stocks. The three closed-end funds floated this year are Morgan Stanley Africa Investment Fund, Alliance Capital Management's Southern Africa Fund and Robert Fleming's New South Africa Fund. While the latter plans to invest 80 percent of its assets in South Africa, the other two funds have broader mandates. Fund Decoder newsletter reports that a number of other investment managers, including James Capel and Oppenheimer, have registered Africa funds.
To see what trouble such an influx can cause, take a look at Turkey; the stock market there is down more than 60 percent this year, after tripling last year.
But the number of stocks available in Africa will grow rapidly, investment managers argue. Frank Savage, chairman of Alliance Corporate Finance Group, which is involved in managing the Southern Africa Fund, cited Ghana's move to sell shares in its Ashanti gold mine, which should be listed on the London Stock Exchange within a few weeks. He said he expected African governments to follow Latin America's example by turning their telephone companies over to the private sector. He also sees opportunities in other infrastructure plays, as well as in consumer-products industries.
Nevertheless, huge risks remain for Africa investors, chief among them political instability. For example, the recent violence in KwaZulu and Natal has frightened investors and helped send the price of the Morgan Stanley Africa Investment Fund down 10 percent last week.
Investors also face risks linked to structural problems, such as investment limits and currency controls. There are also few financial institutions like banks to serve as custodians. (Right now, only a handful of markets meet United States regulatory requirements for mutual-fund investment.) Furthermore, companies must report little or nothing about their activities or profits.
Then there's the fact that, though investment managers may have traveled in Africa and have relationships with local investment firms, that's not the same as being there, said Justin Beckett, president of New Africa Advisers, which has an office in South Africa.
Investors who want to invest in Africa can temper their risks by putting money in a mutual fund that invests in emerging markets around the globe. William McBride, who runs the emerging markets fund information service at Lipper Analytical Services, said he expected that some African funds that came to market this year would find their way into the portfolios of broader-based funds.
A final possibility is to follow in the footsteps of Jean-Marie Eveillard, who runs the Sogen International Fund. Interested in Africa but concerned about the thinness of local markets and the lack of custodian banks, he has invested in companies that do a lot of business across Africa, but whose shares trade in London or Paris. His biggest Africa-related position is Lonrho P.L.C., which has extensive holdings in mining, agriculture and hotels throughout the continent, and is based in London. And he's looking for more.
"What else is left?" he said. "If you look at South Africa, the smaller markets in the Pacific Rim, Poland, China -- all are up considerably. The only emerging market where investors' expectations are low, though not as low as they used to be, is Africa."

THE ECONOMY
 
Bear Sightings Reported on Wall Street
The stock market was on the front pages last week, and the news was bad. Despite a rebound just before trading closed for the week on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average finished the week 8.6 percent below its all-time high of 3,978.36, which was reached on Jan. 31, after a rise of 68 percent that began in October 1990. The recent decline, which has become more intractable day by day, is seen, at best, as being part of a "correction" -- a retreat of roughly 10 to 15 percent from a market high. If this is just a correction, sunny days may not be far away. But some investors are worrying about a full-blown bear market -- a prolonged decline. Excluding the crash of 1929-32, when the market fell 89 percent, the average drop in a bear market has been 36 percent. And that kind of a decline would take us almost back to where the bull market started. 

Hillary Clinton's Bull Market
Listeners to radio financial advice programs are familiar with advertisements trumpeting the spectacular profits to be made in commodities trading. Now they may pay closer attention in light of Hillary Rodham Clinton's adventures in cattle futures trading: an initial $1,000 investment turned into net gains of more than $98,000. It is said that three of four commodities investors lose money. But Mrs. Clinton had the benefit of free advice from James B. Blair, a friend who happened to be an exceptionally skillful trader, and a commodities broker, Robert L. Bone, who has been accused by regulators of bending rules for his best customers. For all their promises, the radio ads cannot offer friends like that.
 
The Stat Behind the Debt
The so-called sabermetricians who mine and refine mountains of baseball statistics have learned that even the most straightforward numbers do not tell the whole truth. The shortstop with the best fielding percentage is probably not the best fielder, for instance. Lawrence B. Lindsey of the Fed may have been practicing something like sabermetrics when he dug into the good news that the debt level of United States households was just 16.2 percent of after-tax income last year, just slightly higher than in the good old 60's and 70's. But Mr. Lindsey found that if you factor out the rich and the elderly, the middle class debt load was really 22.9 percent. That means robust consumer spending is not sustainable for very long, unless income growth picks up.
 
Executive Privilege
An executive with a huge block of his company's stock that has risen handsomely has a bit of problem: if he sells, he must pay a capital gains tax and his voting power will be diminished; if he holds, his profits are only on paper. (We should all have such problems.) But now even this inconvenience is avoidable through an "equity swap" in which a bank or investment firm takes the stock and any dividends it generates for a specified time. The executive, meanwhile, collects income generated when the firm invests an amount equal to the stock's value. Such deals are not available to investors whose holdings are measured in thousands rather than in millions.
 
A Hot Report on Jobs
The most nervously awaited economic report last week was Friday's data on employment in March. The unemployment rate stayed at 6.5 percent, but the economy added an expectedly high 456,000 jobs in March -- the biggest one-month gain in more than six years. Bond traders immediately started thinking the Fed might try to cool things off by raising rates again. In limited trading on Good Friday, Treasury bond prices fell two points.
 
INTERNATIONL
 
Unhappy Warriors
With unexpected suddenness, the Clinton Administration ended export controls on the most advanced commercial telecommunications and computer equipment last week, coinciding with the end of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls. For big high-tech companies like A.T.& T., eager to sell in places like Russia and China (which alone may spend $40 billion to upgrade its phone system this decade), the policy change is enlightened and beneficial, and simply acknowledges that such technology is already available internationally. But some arms control experts are unhappy, arguing that powerful United States computers will easily make their way via third parties into the few nations, like Cuba, Iraq and North Korea, that are still supposed to be off limits.
 
Outdone, and Glad of It
It has become numbing in recent years to read of the various foreign threats to United States competitive pre-eminence. Still, it is shocking to learn that the rate of car theft in England and Wales now exceeds the nationwide rate in the United States. This has not translated into higher insurance premiums on average for British drivers than for Americans, but it has produced an array of sophisticated antitheft technology -- offered routinely on new cars in Britain, but available only as high-priced options here.
 
One Car for All
Reports are coming out of Detroit and Europe about an impending meeting involving 400 senior executives of Ford at which the chairman, Alex Trotman, will reorganize the company according to functions rather than geography. The notion is that the company does not need separate lineups of cars for North America, Europe and Asia. Ford has already started selling a compact car, the Mondeo, in Europe that it expects to introduce in the United States. If one menu can work for McDonald's in 70-odd countries, it seems reasonable to expect Ford to come up with models that can find buyers around the world.
 
COMPANIES
 
The July Cola Has a Nice Bouquet
Last week's big marketing idea was dreamed up at Pepsico to counter flat sales of diet soda. Its solution, backed up by a $25 million ad campaign, is to stamp the bottom of Diet Pepsi cans with freshness dates. Not that a cola more than 14 weeks old is undrinkable. Still, the move won praise from the New York State Consumer Protection Board and from various beverage industry experts. At last, a solution to a problem we never knew existed.
 
Strong Reviews, Weak Profits
To outsiders, the Saturn, the small car from General Motors that was designed to be an import-fighter, is a clearcut success. It has carved a niche in the low-price end of the
market; its owners rave about its quality; and its dealers' above-board sales methods and attentive service are being imitated by others. To G.M. insiders, the picture is more fuzzy. The Saturn unit is barely profitable, and its leaders think they need to produce a lot more cars. Dealers' inventories of Saturns are far above the industry ideal, and as one analyst put it, the brand is facing a "shortage of car buyers."
 
Minding Their Merger Manners
Finding itself with two suitors, Grumman seems to have decided not to subject itself to the kind of messy spectacle that swirled around Paramount for six months. So it told its two swains -- Martin Marietta and Northrop -- to make their best cases for a marriage by 5 P.M. on Thursday, seal their offers and not disclose the contents until Monday. But Grumman may have overlooked something in choreographing this little ceremony: Northrop and Martin Marietta might choose not to be decorous. What happens if one of them comes back with a counteroffer after a winner is announced. Grumman's holders may choose dollars over etiquette.
 
Turmoil at Spectrum, Continued
In this week's episodes, 7 of the 11 directors resigned at Spectrum, the Long Island company that burst on the scene when it hired John Sculley as its chief executive. Among those leaving the board was Peter T. Caserta, who recruited Mr. Sculley. He earlier took a leave of absence as president after his son-in-law and other employees of a second company, Paradigm, which he founded, were arrested and accused of fraud. Then Edward W. Maskaly resigned after all of nine days as Spectrum's chairman and chief executive. He was mentioned in the Federal complaint at Paradigm, but he attributed his departure to reporters' hounding the company. No successor has been named.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
As Italy Turns Right, Stocks Turn Up

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THE election celebrations in Italy began among investors on the Milan stock exchange even before the polls closed last Monday. A mixture of rumor and exit-poll data led investors to conclude -- correctly, it turned out -- that the right-wing coalition led by the businessman Silvio Berlusconi would win a solid victory in the national elections. The market, believing that a clear-cut victory for the right would provide sorely needed political stability and give direction to economic policy, rose sharply.
The Milan market bounced around for the rest of the week as analysts debated whether Mr. Berlusconi would be able to hold together his disparate coalition partners and form a government. The trend, however, was clearly upward. By the end of the week, the Milan BCI index of leading stocks reached 722.99, up 53.26, or nearly 8 percent, since Monday, a performance that had to be considered especially strong in a week in which most other world markets fell precipitously. 
 Whether the market's buoyancy will continue depends to a large extent on whether the right-wing parties can translate their vaguely defined free-market economic philosophies into a workable government policy.
The markets are looking to Mr. Berlusconi and his allies to continue bringing Italy's huge budget deficit under control, to step up the pace of privatization in a nation whose public sector is a bigger part of the economy than in any major Western country, and to loosen the grip of unions.
There are considerable uncertainties as far as economic policy goes, not the least of which is how he will mesh his supply-side campaign rhetoric about simplifying and reducing taxes with the need to continue slashing the budget deficit. At around 10 percent of gross domestic product, Italy's deficit is the largest in the European Union.
There is also the question of whether the neo-Fascists within the electoral coalition would push the nation so far to the right that it would become destabilized.
Still, analysts said they thought the election results would give a sustained psychological boost to the equity market, which was already benefitting from falling interest rates and an economic recovery.
"The market outlook is surely positive in the long term, although the markets now are fairly jittery," said Giorgio Radaelli, an economist who follows Italy for Lehman Brothers.
Mr. Radaelli said the prospect of falling interest rates should eventually help the bond market in Italy as well. Bonds have remained sluggish, largely because of the Europe-wide sell-off in bonds precipitated by rising interest rates in the United States.
Marcus Grubb, a strategist at Salomon Brothers in London, recommended last week that investors increase the proportion of their investment holdings in Italian stocks following the election and raised his year-end target for the BCI index to 775 from 750. He said the fundamental outlook for the market, in terms of interest rates, economic recovery and corporate profits, was positive.
"There may be some near-term weakness in the market if the right-wing alliance has difficulty forming a government, but we would see that as a buying opportunity," Mr. Grubb said.
Italy is slowly emerging from recession, and is expected to record economic growth this year, Salomon Brothers said, of 0.7 percent, although other estimates run as high as 2 percent.
Inflation, however, remains quiescent, and the lira is relatively stable, so most economists expect further reductions in short-term interest rates, probably to around 6.5 percent over the next year, from 8 percent now.
"We expect consumer price inflation to fall gradually to a 24-year low this year and the January data confirmed a deceleration in wage inflation," Mr. Grubb said. "The trend in inflation and the weak economy justifies further rate cuts in coming months."
Even before the election, the stock market was gathering a head of steam, having risen 14.5 percent since the beginning of the year, according to Salomon Brothers.
The market is getting expensive -- it is trading at around 19 times estimated 1994 earnings -- but the index is still well below its historical high of 906, reached in 1986. Moreover, Mr. Grubb said, earnings should surge by 35 percent to 40 percent over the next year.
Marie-Christine Keith, who follows Italy for Natwest Markets in London, said she was recommending cyclical stocks such as Pirelli and Fiat, which should benefit from the economic rebound this year, as well as insurance-industry stocks. Insurers are benefitting from falling interest rates and from a planned liberalization of auto-insurance rates.
Mr. Grubb said Salomon Brothers was recommending interest rate-sensitive equities such as banks, including Banca Commerciale Italiana, and insurers, including Toro Assicurazioni.
In addition, he said, investors should consider stocks in sectors like telecommunications that are likely to be affected by a right-wing government's commitment to privatization and deregulation. He said S.I.P., the main provider of telephone service, was particularly attractive.

HEADLINE: At Work;
A Health Risk Escaping Regulators

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
YOU have an illness that makes you feel faint, pitch over and pass out or vomit. It causes your blood pressure and heart rate to rabbit around. You lose a day or two of work here and there, and sometimes you need treatment in a hospital emergency room. You are worried, and chances are, if you are a white-collar employee and your symptoms appear at work, your employer, and perhaps even local public health officials, will be too.
If you happen to be a tobacco harvester, doing seasonal work, there's a good chance you recognize those symptoms. They are typical of green tobacco sickness, an illness that, as one Kentucky tobacco farmer put it, "can make you feel like you're going to die." Despite evidence that the illness, essentially a form of nicotine poisoning that can affect field workers when wet tobacco touches their skin, is endemic among tobacco pickers, it is widely regarded as a nuisance and a cost of doing business. 
 This is in sharp contrast to concerns over indoor air quality, and especially secondary cigarette smoke, expressed in the form of new regulations proposed late last month by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Assuming the rules go into effect, some six million indoor workplaces in the United States will be virtually free of secondary smoke, which afflicts anyone within breathing distance. But the rules won't cover thousands of harvesters, the workers most directly at risk of tobacco-related health hazards in the workplace.
Green tobacco sickness is not new. Dr. Stephen Gehlbach, now dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, and colleagues reported in a 1974 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association on research conducted among harvesters in North Carolina. They learned that an illness among tobacco workers that appeared to be pesticide poisoning was actually caused by nicotine absorption through the skin. Often tobacco workers carried wet tobacco leaves under their arms or worked in the rain or early-morning dew. "Harvesters would get absolutely drenched in water and solubilized nicotine," he said. "It was like having a poultice of nicotine and water sitting next to the skin."
The reaction to the research, he said, was "an astounding lack of interest. Here were young people working summer jobs, getting sick on this noxious stuff which has no beneficial purpose." Every so often a flurry of interest in the topic would stir -- and die.
The latest flurry occurred last year, when the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reported a 1992 outbreak of green tobacco sickness in south-central Kentucky. It was discovered almost by accident when a project financed by the institute to monitor farm injuries began picking up reports of severe attacks of dizziness, nausea, extreme weakness and other symptoms that required a trip to the hospital.
Epidemiologists studied 47 cases from emergency-room records in the Bowling Green-Elizabethtown area. Extrapolating, they estimated that as many as 600 of Kentucky's 60,000 tobacco workers would have had cases serious enough to require medical attention. The report noted that the figure probably underestimated the incidence of green tobacco sickness because "many affected persons may not seek hospital treatment." The results prompted the institute to issue a health warning.
THE 1992 research is Kentucky-specific, but the study's principal investigator, Dr. Terri J. Ballard, said the illness is the same as the one identified in North Carolina. "It is highlighted in Kentucky because we have a surveillance system in place. I have spoken with people in North Carolina. They are seeing it in migrant clinics," said Dr. Ballard, an institute epidemiologist based in Cincinnati.
It is virtually impossible to speculate about the illness' impact beyond Kentucky because data on it are not collected systematically. Workers who come down with green tobacco sickness are likely to lose a day or two of work and incur the costs of visiting a hospital, which in the study ranged from $250 to $2,041. Tobacco workers typically are not covered by workman's compensation, and they often do not have health insurance.
Despite the economic and health costs and that nothing is known about the long-term effects of repeated episodes, green tobacco sickness doesn't command as much respect as some other occupational health issues.
"It is a problem, but in the grand scheme of life, there are more things you need to worry about," said Dr. Michael Auslander, an epidemiologist at the occupational institute's Kentucky project.
He worries far more on behalf of harvesters about other injuries, like cuts from the tobacco knives, impalements on spears used to hang tobacco and falls from the rafters of tobacco barns, all of which can have more serious consequences than green tobacco sickness. "It's like the flu. No one likes having it, but you aren't worried about dying," he said. Workers know to use protective clothing when feasible, or they can take on other kinds of work.
The alternatives for workers in the area typically are minimum-wage jobs. A very fit and fast tobacco worker can make up to $20 an hour, but most make closer to $8 an hour. Dr. Gary Palmer, an agronomist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, said local people increasingly are choosing fast-food outlets over the tobacco fields. "If you've ever worked in tobacco, you know that being in an air-conditioned building flipping burgers is attractive," he said.
Many harvesting jobs have in recent years been filled by migrant workers, mostly from Mexico, Central America and Haiti, who cannot flee to other jobs if they turn out to be susceptible to green tobacco sickness.
As more becomes known about the illness, more farmers are getting interested. The institute project in Kentucky sends public health nurses to agricultural fairs to give out information. "The farmers care about it because it affects productivity," Dr. Ballard said. Dr. Gehlbach, who has moved on to other research, can still summon up some quiet outrage about the lack of institutional interest in the problem. "It's another very unattractive aspect of the whole tobacco problem in this country," Dr. Gehlbach said. "It is bad enough that the end product causes the problems it does, but even the processing causes misery."

HEADLINE: Profile;
Relighting the Fires at Avon Products

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
THERE'S a flowering plant on Christina A. Gold's desk. She's not sure if it is an azalea or a hibiscus or what. But she loves that plant every bit as much as the more familiar blooms she tends at home.
"A sales rep sent it to me," Ms. Gold said with visible pride. "The note said, 'Thanks for bringing springtime back to Avon.' " 
 Avon Products Inc. has gone through a series of emotional seasons every bit as harsh as the actual winter that just passed. In November, after 24 years with Avon's Canadian division, Ms. Gold was called to New York to become the first woman to head the United States, Canadian and Puerto Rican operations of the direct-sales beauty company. She replaced Walker Lewis, who resigned after only 19 months.
Avon insiders say that Mr. Lewis, a former management consultant, ran Avon entirely with his head. Now Ms. Gold is trying to put heart back into the place.
"Walker was a brilliant strategist," said James E. Preston, Avon's chief executive. "But now we need someone whose first priority is to re-energize the sales force."
Mr. Lewis, reached in Greenwich, Conn., refused to comment. But Avon insiders say it is no coincidence that Mr. Preston says re-energize, not simply energize. For the last five months, Ms. Gold, who is 46, has been reconstructing some of the motivational institutions that Mr. Lewis so carefully took apart.
"Over the last few years, the whole program for incentives was skinnied down," recalled Brian C. Connolly, whom Ms. Gold plucked from the Southeast sales region to become director of national incentives and motivation -- a position that Mr. Lewis had abolished. "The push was toward advertising and chasing fringe customers."
Actually, many of Mr. Lewis's strategies worked. Avon's new "800" number, which allows customers to bypass the Avon Lady to buy direct, has added incremental sales. Anew, Avon's high-tech skin care product, has been successful, as has a new line of skin care products for men. And most analysts have high hopes for lingerie, a new product for which Mr. Lewis laid the groundwork.
Avon's stock, which bottomed at about $19 five years ago, closed at $56.25 on Thursday, the final day of trading last week. The company has stayed independent, despite Chartwell Inc.'s takeover run in 1990.
Ms. Gold's division, which represents about 40 percent of Avon's $4 billion in sales, predicts a first-quarter sales increase of at least 5 percent and a pretax profit increase of better than 25 percent. The increases will happen on Ms. Gold's watch, but they certainly reflect Mr. Lewis's programs.
"Her real test will be the second quarter forward," said Diana K. Temple, an analyst at Salomon Brothers who says she likes Avon stock.
Avon is in fact still reeling from a horrid 1993, when United States sales dropped 1 percent, to $1.40 billion, and pretax profits sank 22 percent, to $152 million. Part of the reason was a money-draining giftware line, and increased costs for marketing and selling. But part was also a general demotivation among the Avon Ladies -- the now politically incorrect term that most people outside the company still use for the 400,000 women who ply Avon products in the United States.
"Walker had some interesting merchandising ideas, but he did not grow the sales staff like he should have," said Jack Salzman, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs who rates Avon stock a "hold."
Ms. Gold concurs. "The sales reps were worried and they were alienated, and they simply were not selling as aggressively as we would like," she said.
During his short reign, Mr. Lewis pared the value of the trips and prizes and commission guarantees that the sales representatives could earn. He stopped sending birthday presents to the high performers. Avon insiders say he even tried to end the practice of giving porcelain statuettes of Mrs. P. F. E. Albee, the first Avon Lady, to the more productive reps.
"The district managers rose up like a tidal wave when Walker tried to do away with the Mrs. Albees," said an Avon veteran who insisted on anonymity. "Women leave these figurines to their daughters and granddaughters, they are so proud of them. Walker just didn't understand."
Still, Ms. Gold and Mr. Lewis are alike in many ways. He paid more attention to sales reps than his "strategy only" reputation might indicate. And she is as interested in new products as he was. She just introduced lingerie and plans to introduce a line of vitamins later this year. She is spearheading a search for "the right gifts at the right price," in hopes of giving Avon's giftware line a broader appeal. And she is trying to streamline the flow of information between Avon's order processors and its distribution centers, so that sales reps can get products to customers more quickly.
BUT Ms. Gold's budgetary strategy has been the mirror image of her predecessor's. She has cut spending on fliers and brochure inserts and insists on testing new marketing plans before rolling them out nationwide. And she's plowing the money that is being freed up into sales incentives.
Avon has long given its sales reps points for dollars of sales, tradable for various gifts. Mr. Lewis made them redeemable only for savings bonds. Ms. Gold's staff has rushed a new catalogue of gifts onto the presses.
"Bonds don't have the same effect as a private catalogue," Mr. Connolly said.
Ms. Gold has resumed sending birthday gifts to high performers. And about a month ago she asked every salaried Avon employee, from forklift operators to Mr. Preston, to handwrite 100 brief thank-you notes to sales reps, for delivery by March 19, which four years ago the company declared to be Avon Representative Day.
Jennifer Evans, a sales rep in Brewster, Wash., says she received an "atta girl" letter from Ms. Gold when she was a few thousand dollars shy of the $75,000 in sales she needed to win a trip to Orlando. "Sure, I would have worked hard without it, but the fact that she took the time to write it meant a lot," said Ms. Evans, who did win the trip. "Christina Gold has added the personal touch back in."
Not that Ms. Gold is not a bottom-line stickler as well. Under her aegis the Canadian division's sales increased at an annual compound rate of 8 percent, and profits went up at a rate of 6 percent -- not bad for a mature market in a deep recession.
"She is disciplined and focused, and by any measure she has delivered financial results," Mr. Preston said.
Ms. Gold clearly attained those results through people, though. In Canada, she brought her district managers to headquarters for three days twice a year, and sounded them out on everything from proposed pricing to ways to introduce commission changes. She offered training in time management and sales techniques to reps. She set part of every day aside to call representatives, and often joined them on sales calls.
"I'd go out with the sales reps who were doing well and with the ones who were doing badly, and I'd pass what the successful ones were doing on to the others," Ms. Gold said.
Now she's trying to open similar lines of communications and meetings in the United States. "Motivation isn't all prizes and things," Ms. Gold said. "It's listening."
Ms. Gold did more of her share of listening in her younger days -- in good part because she was too painfully shy to do much talking. The second of three children, Ms. Gold was an overweight teen-ager, and an introverted one. Born Christina Engelsman in the Netherlands of a Dutch father and Canadian mother, she moved with her family to Canada when she was 4. Her mother, a painter and a nurse, was expansive and outgoing. But, Ms. Gold recalls, her father, a former military officer and Olympic gymnast, set the household's tone.
"He was a hard worker, but he was not an outgoing person," Ms. Gold said. "It was a long time before I realized I had inherited my mother's great love of people."
So sales, with its obligatory schmoozing, was not a career she planned; indeed, she never planned any career. Freshly graduated from Ottawa's Carleton University in 1969 with a degree in geography -- not exactly up there with an M.B.A. in job-grabbing ability -- she took a job at a coupon-center clearinghouse, tallying the cents-off coupons that had been redeemed at supermarkets, then switched to being an inventory control clerk at Avon "because it paid $100 a week, $10 more than I was making."
She did so well keeping track of inventory that she quickly was promoted to marketing. She seemed to be on a fast track -- except that in 1972, Avon folded Canada's marketing operations into United States headquarters. Her husband, Peter Gold, a lawyer whom she met in college, couldn't move his general law practice to the United States. Avon Canada shunted Ms. Gold off to sales promotion, a decidedly non-fast-track area.
There she might have stayed but for Mun Lavigne, then the Canadian division's head of human resources.
"I read her performance appraisals, and I knew this woman should be moved ahead," said Mr. Lavigne, who is now retired.
R. LAVIGNE persuaded Ms. Gold, still only in her 20's, to take a demotion to a supervisory position to get line-management experience. And he persuaded her to come with him to New York to make a presentation to management -- a nightmare task for someone with Ms. Gold's fear of public speaking.
"I was afraid of the people who worked for me, so imagine how I felt about addressing management," Ms. Gold recalled.
Mr. Lavigne recognized the fear, and worked with it. "I made her polish her speech, look people in the eye, vary her tone of voice," he recalled. "I worked her so hard that by the time we went to New York, she wouldn't speak to me on the plane."
Mr. Lavigne didn't let up. A couple of years later, Ms. Gold asked to run sales in a suburban, English-speaking part of Canada. So, he made her head of sales for downtown Montreal, where French is spoken. There followed a series of jobs up the sales and marketing ladders, culminating in her being named head of the Canadian division in 1989.
"I'd keep pushing her to try new things," Mr. Lavigne said. "We had a love-hate relationship, but we ended up with a lot of love and very little hate."
Ms. Gold, who smiles at the memory of Mr. Lavigne, puts it succinctly. "He was my mentor," she said.
Mr. Lavigne was not able to exorcise all of Ms. Gold's demons. She still has terrible stage fright whenever she must speak publicly. And, she acknowledges that she is impatient, a trait that can be offputting to people not as quick as she is and that can sometimes causes her to leap in the wrong direction.
She recalls rolling out a profit-sharing plan in Canada without giving employees a chance to sign off on it. "A lot of them thought it was inequitable," she recalled. "It's no fun having a plant full of people rise up against you." Several group meetings later, a chastened Ms. Gold introduced a plan that better suited the employees.
She is also a self-acknowledged chronic worrier, which has made the move to New York a wrenching one. She's still "shaky" about how corporate performance affects stock price, which as a newly appointed corporate senior vice president she must now worry about.
And the move itself is problematic. Although her husband is looking at business opportunities in New York, for now theirs is a commuter marriage. He lives in Montreal, she's taken a one-year lease on an apartment on 52d Street and Second Avenue. (They have no children.)
"Peter's never begrudged me my job; he's my best cheerleader," Ms. Gold said.
When she's not on the road visiting outlying territories, Ms. Gold is in her West 57th Street office by 8 A.M. and out by 7 P.M., with time for lunch in the employee cafeteria. She rarely brings work home. In Montreal, her passion is downhill skiing. Here, on nights without business dinners, she watches television or plays Nintendo, which she says she enjoys as much as any teen-ager.
And anyone who doubts that she emphasizes people over numbers should just ask her what type of computer she uses, at home or at work. "I've never gotten around to buying one," she says, only a bit abashedly. "I guess I'll have to learn eventually."

HEADLINE: The Economy Should Work for Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Group of Seven conference on employment in industrialized nations, held in Detroit this month, brought with it suggestions that the Europeans and Japanese could learn from the United States how to make their work forces more "flexible" by eliminating some job security, encouraging people to relocate and curtailing unemployment benefits. 
 As an American worker in construction, shipyards and electronics for the last 20 years, I think this puts the matter backward. In democratic societies, the raison d'etre of the economy should be to provide the greatest well-being for the greatest number. Well-being requires -- along with a decent standard of living -- equity, community and, particularly, security. When anyone in a society is insecure, it tends to undermine the security of everyone else, and it corrodes communities. Economies, in other words, need to be user-friendly for the least of their users.
Much of the mammonic savagery haunting our society has spread because we deny economic security to groups on the bottom rungs of our ladder. Violence and substance abuse, illiteracy and infant mortality are toxic externalities of our economy. They are not captured by gross domestic product or even unemployment, but there they are on the corner every day.
The humanity of a society depends on the conditions not of the average but of the lowest percentile. And these, the poorest people, are precisely those who depend on the safety net that would be pulled out from under them with what is being called work force flexibility.
No doubt the experts believe that most workers will ultimately benefit from more "flexible" work forces, and certainly European-style safety nets have a price. But workers, which is to say the majority of us, live in the present with rent to pay and kids to raise regardless of the vagaries of the world economy.
In recent years, productivity increases have too often translated into a lower standard of living for many of us. Why should we now believe that more of the same will provide us all jobs at living wages? If the social security to which workers in most developed countries have grown accustomed reduces the efficiency of some market mechanisms, that may not be a bad price to pay for more secure families and neighborhoods.
The French students who are in the streets protesting a lowered minimum wage have got it right; markets, especially labor markets, are not ends in themselves, but means to social goals. If the markets don't further these goals, they need to be channeled or buffered or changed.
The United States unions that are supporting the right of Mexican workers to organize also have it right. Capital, although it darts around the globe these days at the speed of light, still needs to be held accountable to human values. The labor and environmental standards of international trade must be harmonized upward rather than downward, and we can only accomplish this by practicing solidarity across geographic and economic borders.
I would say we Americans have more to learn about economic security from the rest of the world than vice versa.

In Political Bloopers, Practice Is Everything

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A REPUBLICAN Senator from Virginia named William Scott moved quickly to contain the damage in 1974 after he was branded "the dumbest Congressman of them all" on the cover of New Times magazine. He called a news conference to deny it.
Ten years later, Jerry Springer, a Democrat who was running for Governor of Ohio, also tried to confront a weakness in a public forum. Hoping to neutralize an embarrassing personal incident before it became a campaign issue, Mr. Springer broadcast a television commercial in which he admitted he had paid for the services of a prostitute. By check, no less. He lost the primary but, appropriately, went on to fame as a talk show host. 
 These days, politicians are still getting themselves into trouble. As if blissfully unaware of the obvious consequences, they are still joining all-white country clubs. They are still forgetting to register to vote, or to show up at the polls. They are still making racial slurs.
Maybe the political fraternity missed the latest news about Senator Bob Packwood; clumsily brazen sexual come-ons, it seems, are still the order of the day. In the latest episode, a writer named Lisa DePaulo said Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia repeatedly made suggestive remarks to her when she spent the day with him for a profile in Philadelphia magazine. When Ms. DePaulo was having problems getting through a metal detector, for example, the Mayor joked that she was wearing "a spiked metal bra."
At a news conference after Ms. DePaulo's article hit the streets, Mr. Rendell said, "I feel a little stupid."
Well, yes. But the Mayor did not try to answer the broader question, which is: How can anyone be so stupid? Some authorities favor the arrogance explanation.
"Isolation and hubris account for most of it," said Frank Mankiewicz, a public relations executive who has long been active in Democratic politics. "You get someone who's been in the Senate for 24 years, probably never paid for a haircut, never made a dinner reservation or parked a car. So they're likely to make dumb mistakes."
Others have a simpler answer: "The reasons that politicians do dumb things is that many of them are just plain dumb," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "It shouldn't shock you."
If not shocking, it is striking how politicians do not learn from their own mistakes -- or those of their predecessors. They cannot seem to stop themselves from repeating vintage blunders.
 
Open Mike, Insert Foot
 Unbelievable as it may seem, politicians often forget that the microphone hears everything. Take Representative Martin Hoke, a freshman Republican from Ohio. He got caught on video recently ogling a television producer and commenting to a colleague on the size of her breasts.
Thanks to a "body mike," the world heard it when, on their first full day at the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton snapped at her husband because people were kept waiting at their open house. She should have remembered the trouble Mr. Clinton got into during the primaries when, told incorrectly that the Rev. Jesse Jackson planned to endorse Senator Tom Harkin, he accused Mr. Jackson of "back-stabbing."
As a onetime radio broadcaster, President Reagan should have known better. Remember the microphone test when he joked about attacking Russia? "We begin bombing in five minutes," he said sternly.
 
Makeup by the Taxpayers
 Somehow, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly of Washington must have forgotten President Clinton and the $200 haircut. While her city may be facing bankruptcy, Mayor Kelly insists there is nothing wrong with her spending public money on a makeup artist for her television appearances.
"Vanity, vanity, that will always bring you down," Mr. Koch said of Mayor Kelly. "I guess she looks in the mirror every day and says, 'Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most beautiful mayor of all?' "
 
Into the 19th Hole
 For all their appeals to common folk, politicians seem to be drawn to country clubs that keep out blacks or Jews or women. The most recent is the new Governor of Virginia, George F. Allen, a Republican. He actually joined a club that his three predecessors refused to go to because it bans women. Wisely, he quickly changed his mind. So did Bill Frist of Tennessee, who is seeking the Republican Senate nomination; he recently quit an exclusive club. (But Mr. Frist has another problem, shared by Hugh Rodham, a candidate for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida: he never registered to vote -- in his case, until 1978.)
There are other reasons why politicians might think twice before joining golf clubs. After all, President Bush was hardly convincing when, standing on the green, he said there was no recession.
 
Texas-Sized Stupidity
 The aforementioned examples do not particularly impress Molly Ivins, the Texas writer who has made a career of chronicling political bloopers. "Let's talk seriously dumb," she said before selecting her personal hall of fame.
One member is Reagan Brown, who in his 1982 campaign for re-election as agriculture commissioner stood before the cameras to demonstrate the dangers of fire ants. When he stuck his hand into a mound, he was stung so badly that he went straight to the hospital. He lost.
There is also Mike Martin, a Republican state representative who arranged for his cousin to shoot him (only slightly wounding him, of course) so he would garner sympathy from the voters. First he blamed the attack on devil worshippers, then on his political enemies. Finally, he pleaded guilty to a perjury charge in 1981 and withdrew his re-election bid.
Blaming the press for destroying his career, Mr. Martin vowed to leave Texas, change his name and become a carpenter. At least in political circles, he was never heard from again.

HEADLINE: Little Big Men;
They're All Speaking Perot's Lines

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN practically every democracy you can think of, established political parties are in deep trouble, their legitimacy suspect and their leaders susceptible to attack by populists who preach simple, emotional answers to the complicated questions of the post-cold-war age.
With so much cynicism about conventional politics and politicians around, and with the traditional left largely discredited after the collapse of Communism in 1989, it is hardly surprising that outsiders -- many of them self-made businessmen with enough money of their own to run campaigns that defy the long-dominant party machines -- have popped up in the United States, Poland, Peru, Japan and now Italy with the message that they have the magic cure for unemployment, inefficiency, waste and high taxes. 
 Ross Perot, the self-made Texas billionaire who lectured, scolded and paid his way to political prominence in 1992 with the argument that he could make a clean sweep with his experience as a take-charge innovator, appealed to millions of Americans who might otherwise have resented his wealth. Some Americans were happy to see Morihiro Hosokawa, an outsider like Perot in Japan, break the Liberal Party's stranglehold on public power there last year, and even hoped briefly that he would make Japan a more pliable business partner.
Now comes Italy, where a billionaire media magnate, Silvio Berlusconi, has staked the most credible claim to be the next prime minister by winning last weekend's election in an alliance with neofascists.
Mr. Berlusconi's 20 percent of the vote was about what Mr. Perot got in 1992 when he challenged Bill Clinton and George Bush. But in Italy's parliamentary system, 20 percent was enough to win, because Mr. Berlusconi ran as the head of a rightist coalition alliance that included the separatist Northern League as well as the neofascists.
 
Clean Out the Stables
 All of them benefited from the voters' desire to clean out the stables and throw out the Christian Democratic mafia that had run Italy practically in cahoots with organized crime, since 1948.
"Berlusconi was the ideal third choice for Italian voters who did not want to support the semi-reconstructed left, or were frightened by the right," said Micah Sifry, who edits an unauthorized quarterly called The Perot Periodical in New York City.
Mr. Sifry finds many parallels between people like Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Perot. Some of the other Perot clones are mere flashes in the pan, like the Polish-Canadian millionaire Stanislaw Tyminski, who won a quarter of the presidential vote in Poland in 1990 but failed to win enough votes in parliamentary elections last year for his "Party X" to get into the legislature.
In Canada, where the ruling Conservative Party was nearly swept out of Parliament in the last elections, there is Preston Manning, a westerner who preaches Perot-style tax and budget cuts. In Peru, President Alberto Fujimori was elected in 1990 on a promise to start anew and get the Shining Path guerrilla movement under control; two years later, he dissolved Congress and suspended the Constitution to do it.
In Europe the leaders who would be Mr. Berlusconi's fellow prime ministers find it profoundly disturbing that a non-politician could burst so easily onto the political scene, winning by bombarding voters with campaign propaganda over the three television networks, dozens of local television and radio stations, and through the news and book publishing enterprises he owns.
But the real ground for concern is his plans to include the neofascists of the National Alliance in his government. Fascist supporters made straight-arm salutes in the streets of Rome last week as they celebrated the victory, and Benito Mussolini's granddaughter in Naples, who will be one of the more than 100 Alliance deputies in the new Parliament, said the right's resurgence was "like a dream."
It could be a nightmare. In Italy as in the rest of Europe, neofascists have been mostly beyond the pale for nearly 50 years, even during the cold war, when Italians sometimes came close to putting the Communists into power despite the country's membership in NATO. Now that formerly Communist countries are clamoring to join the alliance, perhaps none of the old taboos can hold much longer.
Where populism and extremism meet in Europe, disaster often follows, as it did after Mussolini and Hitler came to power. Many Europeans fear that the same combination of impulses could lead the ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky to power in Russia, where he won nearly 20 percent of the vote in last December's elections.
Mr. Zhirinovsky has even revived the specter of a new Axis, visiting one of Germany's far-right extremists, Gerhard Frey of the German People's Union, last winter to proclaim undying friendship between the German and Russian peoples (although later he threatened to destroy Germany with nuclear bombs if it got out of line).
 
Disillusionment
 In Germany itself, many voters have opted for ultra-rightists in state elections over the last two years to protest the seeming inability of established parties to deal with problems like uncontrolled immigration and growing chronic unemployment.
The thread that links all these movements, and connects them with the present deep unpopularity of leaders like Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany and Prime Minister John Major in Britain, is a sense that conventional politics just does not have the answers any more.
But as history teaches, populists who win power without established political parties often turn to unsavory allies to carry out their policies -- the generals in Peru; the neofascists in Italy. The thought is hardly reassuring elsewhere.
In Germany, Chancellor Kohl has been in power since 1982, and his party, too, seems to be out of fresh ideas. The opposition Social Democrats have a fresh face in their new leader, Premier Rudolf Scharping of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, but it is unclear whether they can win enough votes in the national elections next October to make him Chancellor.
Weariness with conventional politics was very much in evidence last year, when a bunch of political outsiders calling themselves the "Instead Party" won 5.8 percent of the vote, about as much as the neofascists.
If fascists can join a coalition in Italy, how much longer will it be before they can in Germany? That would be something quite different, and right now it is unthinkable. If Mr. Kohl lost so much support next October that he could only stay in office with support from the ultra-right in a government coalition, he would refuse -- and if he did otherwise, the uproar in Germany and around the world would be easy to imagine.
By comparison, President Clinton's troubles over Whitewater may appear insignificant to many Americans, but a majority of voters in the United States tell public opinion pollsters that they share the general European mistrust of conventional politics and politicians.
Germans call this "Politikverdrossenheit," meaning "disillusionment with politics" or perhaps "antipolitics." In a confusing world it is a danger signal no Western democracy can afford to ignore.

Sure, the Stock Market's Crazy -- Crazy Like a Fox

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
THE financial markets, as everyone knows by now, are peculiar. Stocks and bonds can boom when the economy slumps. They can slump when the economy booms. And they recoil frantically from events with no obvious connection to the lives of American investors, like the assassination of a Mexican presidential candidate.
As an oracle, they flop. Not for nothing did Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, once quip, "The stock market has predicted nine of the last four recessions." 
 Indeed, seven years after the fact, the causes of the 1987 stock-market crash remain mysterious. "Nobody really has a good explanation for the crash," said Merton H. Miller, emeritus professor of finance at the University of Chicago and author of the 1992 book "Financial Innovations and Market Volatility (Basil Blackwell).
In last week's weirdly gyrating downward spiral, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 140 points, or almost four cents on the dollar. Things got so bad that a puckish Wall Street firm, Gruntal & Company, treated callers on hold to the musical theme from the movie "Exodus."
The week's adventure has its own air of mystery even though there are understandable reasons why so many investors wanted to sell and so few wanted to buy. By conventional reasoning it should have been a placid week for the financial markets. There were none of the major economic reports, like the consumer price index, that make stock and bond traders jump out of their shoes; the Federal Reserve Board in the previous week had again nudged up short-term interest rates, a move that won praise from many on Wall Street; in a work week shortened by Good Friday, many Wall Streeters took vacations.
But the markets are not as illogical as they seem. It is just that they live by their own strange and often obscure logic. Last week, for example, economic trends seemed to take a back seat to financial ones: rising interest rates forced speculators who had borrowed billions of dollars to buy stocks and bonds to sell the securities to meet their obligations.
That is not to say, however, that deeper economic fears are not also at work. Pessimism about the economic future is clearly lurking in the background. And therein lies the mystery: what does Wall Street know that the rest of us don't?
Well, it's both what they know and what they don't know that bothers them. They know that the 1970's were bad: a thriving economy meant resurgent inflation, which meant rising interest rates, which meant stocks and bonds were down. Most disturbing now is the Fed's recent decision to raise interest rates to block inflation, even though inflation seemed in check. It appeared as if the priests of the secretive economic temple had some ominous news the rest of us weren't aware of.
Because of the nature of the financial instruments Wall Street professionals are selling, it is their job to think about the future, not the present.
As much as half of the value of a typical stock, economists calculate, reflects earnings and dividends paid over the next five years. And $1,000 worth of bonds paying 5 percent interest, or $50, today would necessarily fall in value if someone in the future offered $1,000 in bonds paying 7 percent interest, or $70. Hence the bond market's fear of inflation.
"The stock market predicts the far-out future, by which I mean a year to 18 months," said John R. Barber, head of equity capital markets at the Wall Street firm of Kidder, Peabody & Co.
But is it a far-out, meaning implausible, future? The fear is not altogether illogical, economists say. The economy grew at a torrid annual rate of 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993, akin to that of a rapidly developing country with runaway inflation. Job growth in March, as reported by the Labor Department on Friday, was far higher than Wall Street economists expected, which also implies inflation.
Yet layoffs continue, real estate is moribund and oil prices are low, all of which imply low inflation.
The economic data so far is thus maddeningly ambiguous. "If the market participants seem confused, it because of the way they communicate with each other and that is indirectly through price," said Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale University, who wrote a 1989 book "Market Volatility" (M.I.T. Press). Prices are intrinsically volatile and the markets can, in effect, talk themselves into a decline, Professor Shiller said.
Mr. Samuelson, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the stock market is largely following the lead of the bond market, whose interest rates can hurt stocks by making borrowing expensive.
"And the bond market is not worrying about inflation," Professor Samuelson said. "It is worrying about Alan Greenspan and the Fed worrying about inflation. The bond market gets paranoid because the Fed is paid to be paranoid about inflation."
 
The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
 Still, there is an unavoidable trap to the logic of the markets. "You cannot get out of the bind of the self-fulfilling prophecy," said Professor Miller of the University of Chicago. "It is the nature of markets."
But if there is one saving grace today, it is the sheer democratization of financial information in the form of business pages in newspapers, personal-finance magazines and Wall Street reporting on radio, television and by on-line computer networks.
"People forget that investors today have changed," said Jonathan L. Steinberg, editor-in-chief of Individual Investor magazine in New York City. "Because of technology, investors today are better informed than J.P. Morgan in his heyday. I don't think they are going to lose their heads in this market."

HEADLINE: Conversations: Don Edwards;
A Champion of Civil Liberties Lays Down His Lance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"THE next civil right really should be some kind of civil right for livelihood," said Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California, the pre-eminent defender of constitutional rights on Capitol Hill. Sitting in his office last week, he observed that civil rights debates have become more complex as the focus shifts from political to economic rights.
"It's all very well for a black kid in Washington to have free speech and not to be discriminated against in getting an auto license," he said. "But unless he has a livelihood, unless he is qualified for a job and has grown up with strict adult supervision, he is going to have a hard time making it in this country." 
 For Mr. Edwards, 79, moving the concept of civil rights forward into another arena is almost a habit. But while he continues this intellectual and moral exercise, he will be championing his concepts in less visible arenas, as he retires in January after 32 years in Congress.
In those years, a time span that stretches from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton, he prodded his colleagues into decisions that did at least as much as any Attorney General to protect people against discrimination.
"It was almost magical in those days," he said of the Johnson years. "We could pass anything if we labeled it civil rights. But now there's almost an avalanche of anti-civil rights things going on."
Mr. Edwards voted for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in employment and public accommodations, and for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. "Kennedy's assassination made a big difference," he said. "Lyndon Johnson emotionally asked us to do it for Jack Kennedy. Johnson was just great on these issues."
Mr. Edwards has been chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights for more than two decades. He passed up opportunities to lead other committees so he could keep his position as monitor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and as field marshal in the battles over civil rights.
Mr. Edwards also turned down a seat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. "I thought I would be trapped by secrecy oaths, and it would interfere with my free speech," he said.
 
'A Paleoliberal'
 Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the ranking Republican on Mr. Edwards's subcommittee, describes his colleague as "a paleoliberal," untouched by revisionism or self-doubt. Yet he said he greatly respects Mr. Edwards as "someone whose principles are not malleable."
"Don Edwards is one of the most thoroughgoing gentlemen that I've encountered in Congress," said Mr. Hyde. "He's soft-spoken. He is passionately committed to the cause of civil liberties. He is relentlessly liberal, but that's not a vice. The battle for the fullest expression of civil liberties is losing a general, not a foot soldier."
Mr. Edwards's independence can be judged from his vote in February on a House resolution condemning a speech by Khalid Abdul Muhammad of the Nation of Islam, who had delivered a vitriolic attack on Jews, Catholics and others. By a vote of 361 to 34, the House denounced the speech as "outrageous hatemongering of the most vicious and vile kind."
Mr. Edwards agreed that the remarks were disgusting and racist, but opposed the resolution. Lawmakers should counter Mr. Muhammad with speeches and press conferences, he argued, but Congress as an institution should not take official action to condemn a particular speech. "That's a chilling precedent," he said. "Will we condemn books and magazines next? Offensive movies?"
Mr. Edwards also disapproves of the campus speech codes through which colleges have tried to restrict speech expressing bias toward women, blacks and members of other minority groups. "I am not in favor of these arbitrary codes," he said. "They have civil liberties problems." Offensive speech requires other remedies, he said, suggesting that counseling and communication were better responses than punishment.
Mr. Edwards, who had not held political office before he was elected to Congress in 1962, grew up in a conservative Republican family. After law school, he served two years as an F.B.I. agent and four years as a Navy officer. He was president of a land title company before coming to Washington.
His son, Leonard P. Edwards, a judge of the Juvenile Court in Santa Clara County, Calif., said his father always had a commitment to civil rights. "He was born with it," said Judge Edwards. "I don't think this is something that he had to reflect upon. It goes to his very essence as a human being. He's very proud of this country and believes that diversity is one of its strengths."
The Congressman's district, at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, includes the heart of San Jose, as well as vineyards of the Santa Clara Valley. Thirty-seven percent of the residents are Hispanic, but many are not registered to vote. Twenty percent of the residents are Asian-Americans, who vote regularly.
 
'Our Apartheid'
 In the Reagan and Bush years, Mr. Edwards and his allies assembled large bipartisan majorities to pass civil rights legislation including the Voting Rights Act extension of 1982, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Fair Housing Amendments of 1988 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which overturned eight Supreme Court decisions.
Today, Mr. Edwards said, it is much more difficult to build such bipartisan bridges. In the struggles of the 1960's, he said, "we had the advantage of a Republican Party that was pro-civil rights." Eighty percent of House Republicans and 61 percent of House Democrats voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, "a really revolutionary bill that eliminated most aspects of our apartheid," he said.
Recently, Mr. Edwards said, "there definitely has been a diminishing interest in resolving the separation and the alienation and the discrimination against black Americans." He agreed with civil rights lobbyists who assert that the Supreme Court poses a grave threat to civil rights and civil liberties. "This Supreme Court has been hostile to civil rights and to civil liberties," Mr. Edwards said.
In the criminal justice system, particularly in death penalty cases, he said, blacks are still struggling to gain constitutional protections that whites enjoy. "Forty percent of the 3,000 people on death row are black, even though blacks are only 13 percent of the population," Mr. Edwards said. "We have some remnants left over from the slavery days," when the punishment for a slave killing his master was much harsher than the penalty for a master killing a slave.
"Most Americans don't understand how important it is to our domestic tranquillity to encourage and advocate a more caring society, which is generous in its laws, its social programs and general attitudes," Mr. Edwards said. "Too many Americans have learned in the last 10 or 15 years that if you just go to church and pray, you are virtuous regardless of how you treat your brothers and sisters, especially the black and Hispanic ones."

HEADLINE: The World;
OPEC's Lonely at the Tap, But China's Getting Thirsty

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE was a time when the meetings of the OPEC oil cartel were covered by every major news organization in the world with all the intensity and fascination of a superpower summit. Any minister emerging from the closed-door sessions who cocked even an eyebrow hinting at a price rise would send hundreds of journalists stampeding to the phones. OPEC reporting was a contact sport. These days, though, OPEC meetings attract about as much attention as a Save the Whales convention, and there are some beginning to ask again whether the oil giant isn't becoming just as endangered as the world's biggest mammal.
Don't bet on it. 
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been declared dead more times than Franco and revived more times than Elvis. No question, it is down again, for some very interesting reasons, but it will rise again -- not just because Detroit keeps making cars that run on gasoline, not just because oil is a diminishing resource, but because when more of China's 1.2 billion people start trading in their bicycles for Toyotas the world will witness the gas-guzzle of all gas-guzzlers.
But first the latest obituary.
Delegates from the 12 OPEC member states gathered in Geneva last weekend and failed again to agree on who should cut back production how much, triggering another drop in oil prices. The main reason that OPEC could not agree to cut from its current ceiling of 24.5 million barrels a day was because Saudi Arabia, which accounts for about a third of OPEC's total output, refused to participate. The failure to reach agreement pushed crude oil prices down over $1 a barrel to near their five-year low of $13.75 a barrel.
"It is strange," said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "Before you would go to an OPEC meeting and the world would tremble. The only question was how high will the price go. Now you go to meetings and at the end of them the price falls. The only question is how low. But OPEC is not dead. Yes, it has been struggling to keep up prices for some time now, but given its hold over world oil reserves it's bound to come back."
But time has not been kind to OPEC lately. Indeed, when adjusted for inflation, the present OPEC oil price is now roughly where it was in 1973, before the first oil price explosion, when crude was selling for about $4 a barrel. What that means is that despite all of OPEC's incredible financial gains over the years, and all the fears it instilled in world markets, it has effectively been stuck in neutral in real price terms. How could that be?
OPEC's history is textbook proof that the free market works. OPEC teaches that when you raise the price of a commodity far above its production costs -- as OPEC did in the 1970's, when it yanked prices up above $30 a barrel -- you trigger a counterreaction. In OPEC's case it triggered heightened oil exploration in non-OPEC countries, long-term movements toward conservation, improvements in oil-drilling technology to suck crude from the remotest spots on earth and a search for alternative energy sources -- all of which combined in the 1980's to shrink demand for OPEC oil.
When this first became apparent in 1985, OPEC changed strategy. It shifted its focus from hiking prices to maintaining its market share in the face of all sorts of new competitors. To this end, OPEC, which accounts for 37 percent of world oil production, agreed on a strategy of effectively lowering prices, or holding the line on them, on the calculation that this would kill off some of the alternative energies and non-OPEC competition, while gradually rebuilding demand for OPEC oil so that prices could again be ratcheted upward.
 
Ganging Up on the Saudis
 Wrong. The market-share strategy has yet to really work, because OPEC underestimated the forces of conservation, exploration and alternative energies it unleashed in 1973. These, combined with the fact that OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran instituted huge social-welfare and infrastructure projects that had to be paid for, meant the market remained saturated. The result has been flat-to-falling oil prices.
At the recent Geneva meeting, Iran and other OPEC members ganged up on Saudi Arabia, demanding that it cut back some of its huge production. But the Saudis refused. They argued that it made little sense for them to cut back now, because the other OPEC members would just cheat and gobble up their market share and the price would stay the same. The Saudis said they would consider a cutback only to make room for massive Iraqi production, when Baghdad is permitted to resume oil exports after fulfilling United Nations conditions imposed after the Gulf war. The Saudis said they have 100 years of oil in their backyard and their priority must be to protect their market share for the long haul -- even if it means lower prices today.
Analysts wonder how long Iran, Saudi Arabia's much larger neighbor, will sit quietly for such a strategy. Iran may be tempted to send King Fahd a message "by other means," as they say in the neighborhood. No wonder with all of its budget woes, Saudi Arabia has not halted its military modernization program.
OPEC's long-term hopes are pinned on one region: China and its Asian neighbors. While growth in oil demand in Europe and the United States is expected to be flat over the next decade, Asian demand is expected to grow by the year 2000 by 5 million barrels a day, according to Fereidun Fesharaki, energy expert at Hawaii's East-West Center. China's oil consumption alone is growing 10 percent a year. In 1990, China exported 500,000 barrels a day. By 2000 it will be importing 1.3 million barrels a day, or the equivalent of virtually all of Kuwait's export production. (China, no doubt, will be increasingly tempted to pay for this by selling arms.)
"All the big growth will come out of Asia," said Mr. Fesharaki. "We see demand for OPEC oil increasing by 10 million barrels a day by the year 2,000, with 7.5 million barrels coming from Asia, 1 million from Mexico and Brazil and the rest from inside OPEC. It means prices will remain roughly where they are for the next five years, and then we will see fear and increases coming back to the market."
Asia and the Persian Gulf will become two increasingly critical pillars influencing global politics and economics. Their links could produce a power axis that would rival the trans-Atlantic one. "And," added Mr. Fesharaki, "they won't have to take orders from London, Paris or Washington anymore."

HEADLINE: Workers Become Job Hunters as Company Reinvents Itself

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 1

 BODY:
After 23 years at the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, including the last five as a department head, David A. Fravel applied for his own job this week. He filled out an application. He had an interview. Now, like job seekers everywhere, he waits.
Mr. Fravel, 47, has no guarantee of getting this or any other position at the company where he has made his career, but neither is he expecting to be laid off. What that leaves, for him and each of the company's 1,889 other employees -- all of whom will be required to reapply for jobs over the next few months -- is the uncertainty of starting from scratch. 
 Every job from the top down is being declared a new position, with a new pay scale and new duties, and most are being posted for open competition from any and all takers. Even if Mr. Fravel ends up with a similar job making similar pay, nothing, he said, will ever be quite same.
"It's a little bit unnerving," he said.
Unnerving is only the half of it. This healthy midsized company is effectively turning itself inside out before the eyes of its startled employees: all in the name of a vague concept called "client service." Company officials say they must shake things up because every financial-service company is evolving into some new form, and competition demands quicker responses and new ways of thinking.
But many employees say they feel like strangers in their own office: no matter what they've done, they have to prove themselves all over again.
 
Beyond Reorganization
 Certainly, many companies in the region and around the country have re-engineered and retooled in the recession. From General Electric to I.B.M. and A.T.& T. to General Motors -- not to mention the Hartford insurance giants like Aetna and Travelers -- companies have reorganized to cut costs and workers. And some have thrown open existing jobs to new applicants, though usually after a merger when two similar companies or divisions have been combined.
What is happening here, however, and in places like Yale-New Haven Hospital, which is redefining hundreds of hospital jobs to try to improve service to patients, is something else. The driving force is not job cuts or bean counting, the company says, but rather a sort of collective reawakening, the better to sell insurance. And every single person in the company is involved. That is not a completely new idea, but it is getting a workout here that management experts say is probably singular in the nation in scope and scale.
"What's different in Connecticut Mutual's approach is that in all the other instances I've heard of, it's been in the context of downsizing," said Bill McKendree, a vice president of People Tech Consulting, a Connecticut firm that specializes in organizational change and which has advised Connecticut Mutual on the overhaul. "This is not a retrenchment mentality, it's a growth mentality," Mr. McKendree said.
It's also a mentality of deliberate and calculated chaos, company officials say.
"What we're introducing is uncertainty in an organization that has for 140 years worked on getting rid of every shred of uncertainty that could ever exist," said Bill Garfield, Connecticut Mutual's Vice President of Human Resources.
 
'Right Amount of Anxiety'
 David E. Sams Jr., 51, a fast-talking Southerner who was hired last year as the first President and Chief Executive Officer in Connecticut Mutual's 147-year history to be brought in from outside, said raising anxieties is part of his mission. From his sports cars to his occasional appearance at the office without socks, and from his startling propensity to sit down with groups of employees in the company cafeteria to the practical jokes he plays on senior staff members, Mr. Sams has stirred these still waters.
"I want there to be the right amount of anxiety in the system," said Mr. Sams, who came from Capital Holding Corporation, an insurance holding company in Louisville, Ky. "Obviously our challenge is to keep that at such a level as to be manageable, so that people aren't fearful -- and I guess that's the risk."
Connecticut Mutual, one of the oldest of the old-line Hartford insurance companies, is by no means a firm struggling on the brink of doom. Just two months ago it paid 1993 salary bonuses of 9.7 percent of base pay, or more than four times the previous year's total, to every worker. The company's mutual funds have been highfliers on Wall Street, and corporate expenses are not out of line, Mr. Sams said. Net income last year was up 20 percent over the year before.
And while Mr. Sams has said that some new employees might be hired from the outside for some jobs and that he would like part of everyone's base pay to be directly tied to profits, he has vowed repeatedly that his "Transformation Project" is not about shrinking Connecticut Mutual. If it is slightly smaller at the end, that will be an inadvertent byproduct, he said. Employees are not being braced for large numbers of layoffs.
 
Frightening or Challenging?
 But what they are being hit with is just as shocking: a complete break with the past. The responsibility for career management is being shifted back to each employee, who may apply for any three posted jobs. People who have not filled out job applications since coming here after high school in the 1960's will have to type a resume and sell their strengths all over again. Public computer terminals are to be placed around the building to allow easier perusal of job posting lists. Newly hired managers will be responsible, in turn, for hiring their own staffs.
Countering all that change is a sense of history and deep tradition. George Armstrong Custer was turned down as a bad risk, for example, while President William Howard Taft, whose ample flesh was deemed "hard and solid" by company underwriters, was deemed worthy. Among employees there is a sharp disparity between those who see this new future as a frightening place and those who hear in all the chaos the sound of opportunity knocking.
The shake-up, still only in its initial stage, calls for most jobs to be posted this month, with interviews to follow and employees reassigned by July 1. The jobs are being filled from the top down -- though Mr. Sams was exempted -- and each successive layer of the company will define and fill the jobs in the next layer. Company officials say most salaries will not change significantly, but that some could go up, and some could go down.
"People are afraid of losing their jobs," said Gerry Bolling, a new-business analyst who has been with the company for 10 years. "It's nerve-racking. People are nervous; they don't want to admit it, but they are."
Many employees wouldn't give their names or allow their pictures to be taken. Because just about everything is unknown, they said -- including who will make decisions about most hiring, since the middle-management tier has not yet been filled -- people don't know who to worry about offending, or buttering up.
"You've just got to sit tight and hope for the best, I guess," said one risk-management employee who said she was afraid to give her name. "People don't know what's going on and what's going to happen."
Robert J. Klemyk believes it's all upward and onward. A 28-year-old assistant financial-services consultant who has been at the company for a year, he calls himself "very highly motivated." He sees the change as a unique chance for an ambitious young man to be noticed and really move up in a firm and an industry not generally known for dynamism.
"Being new to the company, I think I'm in an enviable position," he said. "I can almost pick and choose what I want to do."
 
'You've Got to Balance'
 Part of the risk being taken by Connecticut Mutual will only be evident deep into the future, experts say, as employees consider what has happened and adjust to the new workplace mood. And if the conclusion they come to is that all the emotional and career turmoil was for nothing, the process could backfire.
"You've got to balance," said Paul S. Goodman, a professor of industrial administration and psychology at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "If you just work either side -- the human or the technical -- you get in a lot of trouble, it doesn't work."
Some employees are already grousing that Mr. Sams's new vision of the company -- to market products more aggressively to business owners and affluent individuals and to move the company into closer contact with policy holders and investors -- is not a fundamental change. Connecticut Mutual has called itself "the Blue Chip Company" for years. And some people, despite the flurry of statements and newsletters and brochures to explain the process, say it's all about layoffs anyway, no matter what the company really says.
"Somebody has to speak up," said Ms. Bolling, the new-business analyst. "If you feel that I can't do my job, or if I'm not qualified to do my job, lay me off. Don't have me go through all this."

HEADLINE: Managing to Fail: How a Hospital Wasn't Built -- A special report;
Project Adrift: Kings County's Lost Decade

BYLINE: The following article is based on reporting by Alan Finder, David Firestone and James C. McKinley Jr. and was written by Mr. Finder. 

 BODY:
Twice in the last five years, senior New York City hospital officials had serious doubts about their ability to manage the troubled $1 billion reconstruction of the Kings County Hospital Center.
 Each time they considered whether to turn the effort over to a state construction agency with long experience in large public projects. But each time they decided to press ahead -- a decision that one former head of the hospital system, Dr. James R. Dumpson, now concedes was a mistake. 
 Those two moments of doubt -- when warnings of disaster were made but no one in authority seemed able to respond -- illustrate the failure of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation to master the largest construction project it has ever undertaken: a renovation now 32 months behind schedule, with the delay costing an estimated $100,000 a day.
Two months after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suspended the decade-old project, Kings County Hospital is a symbol of governmental mismanagement. And while a joint Federal and local inquiry into possible corruption is under way, the problems seem more fundamentally rooted in a pattern of ineptitude in which the pressures and uncertainties of politics sometimes overrode the judgments of professionals.
The hospital officials who began to question their agency in 1988 and 1989 and again in 1992 and 1993 were reluctant to risk declaring the Kings County job a failure and publicly asking the state to step in, several present and former participants in the project said.
And because of instability and turnover within the top ranks of the hospitals corporation, the senior officials who considered asking the state to take over the project during the last two years had no idea that their predecessors had contemplated the same thing only three years earlier.
In the end, many participants said, the reconstruction job was undermined less by any one specific decision than by a general inability to manage effectively, to follow through on major decisions and to control both the complex politics and the challenging design and construction of a huge public project.
"They never had the ability to manage a project like this," said Jerry A. Davis, the project's chief architect.
For example, in 1992, seven years after planning had begun, hospital officials considered breaking the job into 200 prime contracts to satisfy demands for more involvement by minority-owned companies. "Is this the right thing to do?" Mr. Davis recalls being asked. "I said, 'It's insane.' " A compromise of 111 contracts was reached, an outcome that left Mr. Davis warning -- correctly -- that it would cause delays and cost overruns.
About the same time, the hospitals corporation first awarded a $4 million contract to excavate the site of the new main hospital. The contract was ultimately awarded a total of four times to three different companies -- and the paperwork still was not completed when Mr. Giuliani suspended work in February.
Interviews with dozens of participants in the Kings County project and a review of internal audits, letters and other documents of the Health and Hospitals Corporation point to several broad problems that brought the project to a standstill.
First, it was a result of the hospital agency's inexperience with a job as complicated and expensive as rebuilding Kings County, New York's largest public hospital, while it remained open.
It resulted, too, from several significant decisions that immensely complicated an already challenging task. Among them was the agency's decision -- dictated largely by hospital and community politics -- to place the new main building in the middle of the crowded Kings County campus. That forced the construction of two additional buildings and the demolition of six others, adding perhaps three years to the project.
But as much as anything, the failure to rebuild the hospital on time and within budget reflects a lack of continuity at an agency that has had four presidents and an acting president since 1985.
 
Now, the Investigations
 Today, after having spent $110 million, hospital officials are evaluating whether a new, 1,200-bed complex planned a decade ago still makes sense at a time when hospitals' inpatient populations have declined amid a new emphasis on preventive care.
The city Department of Investigation, the Brooklyn District Attorney and the United States Attorney in Brooklyn are looking into the project. Among the concerns is whether a private consultant and a state Assemblyman, who are law partners, had a conflict of interest when they advocated the hiring of minority contractors at Kings County.
The hospital is also at the center of a political struggle, with some black elected officials in Brooklyn accusing the new Mayor of stopping the reconstruction to punish black New Yorkers who did not support him last November.
 
 
The Site
Confident Steps Toward Disaster

New York City officials have been talking since the early 1960's about renovating Kings County, which consists of 23 buildings spread over a 24-acre campus in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. In 1983, as the city emerged from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, hospital officials started planning an ambitious rebuilding of the antiquated complex, much of which was completed in 1932.
By the mid-1980's, as New York's fiscal picture improved, some senior hospital officials had grown confident that their agency could handle the huge rebuilding project. "We were starting to deliver projects, admittedly smaller projects, on time, and we were able to hire really top quality constructions managers from the industry," said Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation from 1985 to 1989. "We had as much confidence at that point from a professional point of view as we would have going to another entity."
Some officials also hoped that by doing the project themselves they could avoid the debacle involving the construction of Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center in Brooklyn, a project that had been overseen by a state agency, the Facilities Development Corporation. When Woodhull opened in 1982, it was six years behind schedule and had cost four times its original estimate.
By September 1986, a consultant completed a master plan for Kings County, calling for a large new main hospital building of about 1.4 million square feet, and substantial renovation of many existing buildings. Cost estimates ranged from $500 million to more than $1 billion.
 
A Critical Misstep
 In May 1987, the Health and Hospitals Corporation selected the architects and a construction manager. By June 1988, the planners had resolved a critical question: whether to put the new main hospital building in the middle of the Kings County campus or in a less-crowded corner to the northeast.
The central location won out, producing a cascade of complications that added up to three years of work, according to officials who helped oversee the project.
The decision forced hospital officials and the architects to plan the demolition of six buildings and part of a seventh. They also had to add two new buildings to replace those demolished. The two buildings cost a total of $16.7 million and are the only parts of the project that have been completed.
The city also had to spend $13.7 million to reroute electric, telephone and steam lines around the site of the new main building.
This work could have been avoided, two former project executives said, if the planners had decided to put the new hospital in a then-vacant section of the campus a few blocks to the northeast. "We would have saved millions if we had built it there, and it would have been built faster," said a former project manager, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
But there was pressure to place the new main building in the center of the campus. Members of the hospital's Community Advisory Board, representing residents of central Brooklyn, had long sought more cooperation between Kings County and the State University's Health Science Center at Brooklyn, a hospital and medical school commonly known as Downstate, which is across Clarkson Avenue from Kings County.
Advisory board members thought that if the new hospital was placed directly across the street from Downstate, the two institutions might be bound more closely. The State Health Department has also tried for years, without success, to get Kings County and Downstate to end what state officials see as a broad duplication of medical services.
Some doctors at Downstate had more mundane reasons for insisting that the new main building be in the middle of the campus. Putting the new hospital on the vacant site would have meant an extra walk of about three blocks.
 
Excavation
For $110 Million, Not Much to See
 Critics have faulted the Health and Hospitals Corporation often in recent months for spending $110 million at Kings County and having only a hole in the ground to show for it.
In fact, the hole was never dug.
On April 30, 1992, hospital officials opened the bids on a contract that would finally start excavation for the new main building. The officials declared the lowest bidder, the Cross Bay Contracting Corporation, to be ineligible because the company had not submitted preliminary paperwork to qualify for the job. They awarded the contract the next day to the second-lowest bidder, the Blandford Land Clearing Corporation.
That set in motion a series of events that delayed the start of excavation for at least a year. Cross Bay went to court to contest its disqualification, and three months later, Justice Herman Cahn of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ordered the hospitals corporation to accept Cross Bay's bid.
 
Convictions and Complications
 But in July 1993, as Cross Bay prepared to begin excavation, hospital officials learned that a Cross Bay official had been convicted of mail fraud in 1987. Hospital officials canceled the contract and in late September awarded it again to Blandford.
Eleven days later, the corporation ordered Blandford to stop all work after the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, found that it had misrepresented and omitted information in required background forms.
By late November, the corporation reached agreement with a third excavation contractor, Macro Enterprises. When Mr. Giuliani halted work at Kings County two months ago, city officials had completed a background check of the contractor, but not of its subcontractors.
 
Contracts
One Project Split Into Hundreds
 From the beginning, the officials who planned the rebuilding of Kings County were determined to include construction companies owned by women and minorities. "There was a real desire to make a major construction project redound to the economic improvement of that community," said Dr. Boufford, the former president of the hospitals corporation.
To that end, the corporation awarded a $349,000 contract in December 1988 to Darryl E. Greene & Associates, to help hospital officials identify qualified construction companies with black, Hispanic or female owners and to nurture the companies through the intricacies of major construction work. The contract was renewed and expanded twice in subsequent years.
The contracts and Mr. Greene's ties with Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. -- the Brooklyn Democratic leader who has been an ardent supporter of the Kings County rebuilding and who is also a law partner of Mr. Greene's -- are among the aspects of the Kings County project now under investigation. Mr. Norman said he had not yet met Mr. Greene when he won his first contract, and he maintained that they did nothing improper.
By early 1991, in response to complaints from minority contractors and black elected officials, hospital officials began discussing whether to divide the 20 to 40 major construction contracts at Kings County into many smaller pieces.
 
Contractors Complain
 Dr. J. Emilio Carrillo, then president of the hospitals corporation, contended in internal discussions that splitting up the contracts would make them more accessible to minority contractors, who generally lack the experience and financial resources of white-owned companies. He also argued that dividing the contracts would attract more bidders and thus drive down prices.
Dr. Carrillo took his idea to Mayor David N. Dinkins, who approved it, according to several hospital officials.
But the policy was not yet public, and minority contractors continued to complain to local elected officials. In the summer of 1991, the politicians stepped in. That August, many local elected officials, joined by more than 100 minority contractors, met in a large auditorium at Downstate with Dr. Carrillo and other senior officials of the hospitals corporation. The hospital officials announced that they were considering splitting up the contracts, but did not specify a number. Soon, some hospital officials were talking privately of as many as 100 to 200 prime contracts.
In a letter dated Aug. 16, 1991, Mr. Davis, the chief architect, told Dr. Carrillo that having so many small contracts on a project as huge as Kings County was highly unusual and would likely lead to extensive delays and added costs.
But Romeo R. Adams, then a senior vice president at the hospitals corporation, and Mr. Greene, the agency's consultant, continued to push for as many as 200 prime contracts, Mr. Davis said. Finally, in the latter half of 1992, after Mr. Adams had been eased out by a new corporation president, Dr. Billy E. Jones, officials settled on 111 prime contracts. The internal debate had lasted at least 18 months.
 
Pinning Blame for Delays
 Early last month, Joseph Quinones, a senior director of the hospitals corporation, said that dividing up the contracts had delayed construction by two years. He said that redesigning, the performance of the construction manager and the problems with the excavation contract had also caused delays. But he said the contracting delays far outweighed the others.
Mr. Norman and other Brooklyn politicians argued, however, that the other problems were equally responsible for the delays. "The emphasis is being put on the affirmative action program because the Mayor wants to knock it out," Mr. Norman said. "This is political payback."
Rudolph J. Rinaldi, a former city Buildings Commissioner who is now executive director of the State Dormitory Authority, said that dividing up a construction job into 100 parts is not unprecedented. His agency is overseeing a $270 million rebuilding of Roswell Park, a major hospital and cancer research center in Buffalo. The project is divided into more than 100 prime contracts to allow more participation by minority-owned companies, he said.
"You can do 100 contracts, but you have to manage it," he said.
 
Second Thoughts
Talks With State Led Nowhere
 While the severity of the problems at Kings County has become clear only in recent months, some senior members of the Health and Hospitals Corporation had long worried that the job was too big for the agency.
Anthony F. Japha, who was then the corporation's vice president in charge of capital programs, said he became concerned in 1988 and 1989 that the agency lacked the experience to oversee the job. He began talks with the Dormitory Authority.
"It became apparent to me that there were a number of things in which H.H.C. did not have a comparative advantage when it came to large construction projects," said Mr. Japha, citing the Dormitory Authority's financial and management systems, its experience and reputation within the construction industry.
But the informal discussions with state officials broke down. Several participants said they could not recall why. "The conversations just kind of faded off into nothing," said Thomas A. Devane, the deputy executive director for planning and development at the Dormitory Authority.
Dr. Boufford said there was just a general feeling at the hospitals corporation that it could get the job done.
A few years later, in 1992 and 1993, a new management team at the hospitals corporation -- unaware of the earlier talks with the state agency -- also thought about asking the Dormitory Authority for help.
Disturbed about the escalating problems at Kings County, Dr. Dumpson, then chairman of the corporation's board, said that he and Dr. Jones, the president, discussed among themselves "whether we should continue to rebuild this hospital or whether we should ask the State Dormitory Authority to do it for us."
The idea was not pursued, Dr. Dumpson said, in part because the project was too far along, and too much money had already been spent.
"In hindsight," he said, "I wish that Dr. Jones and I had done what we considered several times, and that is to say: 'Stop this. We will go no further.' And ask an outside body to do it for us."

HEADLINE: Wanting Health Care Help, Voters Tell of Apprehensions

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORT WAYNE, Ind., April 2

 BODY:
For Representative Jill Long, the most telling moment of this Congressional recess may have come as she took a break before a long siege of public forums on health care, only to have her own mother look across the dining room table and ask, "Jill, if the Clinton health plan gets through, will I be able to choose my own doctor?"
There is, it seems, no end to the public's questions and apprehensions during this Easter recess, probably the last break before lawmakers begin to step up to some very hard and very fundamental votes on health care. A visit to "town meetings" on the issue here and in Winfield, Kan., and Rockford, Ill., this week showed a volatile, passionate debate at the grass roots. 
 It was shaped, in part, by the attacks of the interest groups, but also by some of the most powerful beliefs and attitudes whipping through politics today: suspicion over taxes and cynicism toward Government, but at the same time, a conviction that average working people need help, especially on health care.
Often skeptical, always intent, people asked their lawmakers who would pay for revamping health care: "Would someone honestly tell the American people how much this is going to cost them?" demanded Gene Cawvey, a retiree in Fort Wayne.
They challenged the ability of their Government to pull off an overhaul of one-seventh of the economy. Shouldn't the Federal Government "clean its own house" asked Shannon S. Barnes, a nurse from Valley Center, Kan., "before you tackle something as complicated as health care?"
They probed about the mechanics of the plan, including the effect on Medicare, the possibility of long-term care, and they worried about the morality. "Please don't make me pay for abortion on demand," said Randall Stepanek, an industrial engineer in Fort Wayne.
For all the talk in Washington about rival proposals, it was the Clinton plan that seemed uppermost on people's minds, and the level of confusion and concern was high.
"There's been a pretty successful campaign to misinform," said a frustrated Ms. Long, a Democrat who is a cosponsor of both the President's plan and a more conservative version proposed by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee. "Some people think the President's plan is a health insurance plan that they'll be required to buy."
Ms. Long labored long and earnestly to explain to her constituents the concept of the alliance, the regional insurance purchasing pool that is at the heart of the Clinton plan and that seemed to be the source of much confusion. She argued that the alliances would simply concentrate the bargaining power of individuals and companies to get a good deal on coverage. But Ms. Long, like others speaking on behalf of the Clinton approach, remained on the defensive.
 
5 Easy Principles
 In Winfield, several hundred people turned out on a mild Wednesday night for a forum with Representative Dan Glickman and to hear Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, make the case for the Clinton plan. The Secretary came with a chart that boiled it down to five, easy-to-swallow principles, like "Preserve Medicare."
And she delivered a long, user-friendly oration that likened health alliances to a well-known institution in the Midwest, Wal-Mart, and, specifically, to a Wal-Mart-affiliated wholesale discounter known as "Sam's Club." "Now where's the Government in all that?" she asked at the end, underscoring the President's commitment to a health care system that remains in the private sector.
But the questions kept coming, people lining up six deep at the microphones in the auditorium of Winfield High, debating for more than two hours what the Government could do and should do, and how and when and why. "In Kansas, 91 percent of the people who live here have medical insurance," said Dr. George Randall, a doctor in the Wichita area. "I don't think turning the whole system upside down to accommodate that 9 percent is what we want to do."
Lambasting the Clinton plan as an explosion of Government, Dr. Randall concluded, "Name one Government agency that's run efficiently and with no cost-overruns, and I'll drink that pitcher of water up there."
Ms. Shalala picked up the pitcher of water at the speakers' table and walked toward the edge of the stage. "Social Security," she shot back, triumphantly. (The doctor did not drink.) The audience applauded, in consensus at least on the merits of Social Security, but the anxiety about Government came up again and again that night.
 
Fear of Government
 This mistrust runs throughout the national opinion polls and underlies the drop in support for the Clinton plan, said Bob Blendon, an expert on polling and health at Harvard University. It is the anxious hallmark of the current stage of the health care debate, in which the public has moved beyond identifying the problem and is confronting the realities of the proposed solutions. "You have this very real problem," Mr. Blendon explained. "You want the Federal Government to act, but the longer the debate goes on, the more your basic prejudice comes out -- that the Government won't do it right."
This is also where the attacks by interest groups and conservative Republicans have largely been focused.
At the forum in Rockford, one of many sponsored by the League of Women Voters and the Kaiser Family Foundation, Representative Donald Manzullo, a Republican, opened his presentation with a by-the-book ideological attack on the Clinton plan, including the now famous Republican flow chart -- health care as designed by Rube Goldberg -- and repeated warnings about turning the health care system over to the equivalent of the Post Office.
"Either we trust the market or we trust the Government," said Mr. Manzullo, who supports a House Republican plan, a modest package of insurance industry changes and subsidies for low-income people. That plan, Mr. Manzullo declared, offers "guaranteed health accessibility for all Americans."
But Mr. Manzullo came in for his share of grilling; the audience submitted their questions on cards, and the moderator said most questions to Mr. Manzullo challenged his promise of accessibility. They were, the moderator said, along the lines of, "I have access to a Cadillac auto agency, but I can't afford a Cadillac."
 
Seeing Need for Help
 Similarly, when a doctor at the Winfield forum talked about the possibility of tax-free medical savings accounts, it was too much for one member of the well-mannered audience: "The wealthy be healthy and the rest can be damned is what you just said," the man shouted.
And when people rose to complain that many uninsured were simply irresponsible, someone usually rose to the uninsured's defense. That tension ran throughout the forums, a familiar echo of the long-running debates in American politics: Is Government a burden on individual freedom, or an instrument of equity?
Advocates of a Canadian-style system of national health insurance were often among the most impassioned participants in this debate.
"I was a registered nurse for 42 years," said 85-year-old Laurel Von Feldt, rising briskly to the challenge of reform. Identifying herself as a supporter of a system like Canada's but urging quick action on the Clinton plan, Ms. Von Feldt declared at the Winfield forum: "There's a lot wrong, there's something just out of whack. The doctors get paid about eight times what the working man gets paid today."
In the end, though, the sense of apprehension about major change was strong at Winfield and elsewhere. There was still the sense that the nation stands at a moment of opportunity -- an elderly man at Fort Wayne told Ms. Long, "I just want to say, I will be proud to live in a country that furnishes medical care to all of us." And there was still the clear expectation that something big would be done to the health care system.
But the recent months of claims and counter-claims from Washington have left their mark; the issue is politicized among the public in a way that it did not seem to be before. Patricia Nelson, a League of Women Voters organizer who coordinated the forum in Rockford, worried that the battle was getting out of hand. With her stacks of information on the various bills, she looked about grimly and said: "We feel a little bit like David and Goliath. I've read about the millions being spent lobbying in Washington. We're working with a $1,200 grant here."

HEADLINE: Piedmont Journal;
Tried by Deadly Tornado, An Anchor of Faith Holds

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PIEDMONT, Ala., April 2

 BODY:
This is a place where grandmothers hold babies on their laps under the stars and whisper in their ears that the lights in the sky are holes in the floor of heaven. This is a place where the song "Jesus Loves Me" has rocked generations to sleep, and heaven is not a concept, but a destination.
Yet in this place where many things, even storms, are viewed as God's will, people strong in their faith and their children have died in, of all places, a church. 
 "We are trained from birth not to question God," said 23-year-old Robyn Tucker King of Piedmont, where 20 people, including six children, were killed when a tornado tore through the Goshen United Methodist Church on Palm Sunday.
"But why?" she said. "Why a church? Why those little children? Why? Why? Why?"
The destruction of this little country church and the deaths, including the pastor's vivacious 4-year-old daughter, have shaken the faith of many people who live in this deeply religious corner of Alabama, about 80 miles northeast of Birmingham.
It is not that it has turned them against God. But it has hurt them in a place usually safe from hurt, like a bruise on the soul.
They saw friends and family crushed in what they believed to be the safest place on earth, then carried away on makeshift stretchers of splintered church pews. They saw two other nearby churches destroyed, those congregations somehow spared while funerals for Goshen went on all week and the obituaries filled an entire page in the local paper.
But more troubling than anything, said the people who lost friends and family in the Goshen church, were the tiny patent-leather children's shoes scattered in the ruin. They were new Easter shoes, bought especially for church.
"If that don't shake your faith," said Michael Spears, who works at Lively's Food Market in downtown Piedmont, "nothing will."
The minister of the Goshen church, the Rev. Kelly Clem, her face covered with bruises from the fallen roof, buried her daughter Hannah on Wednesday. Of all people, she understands how hurtful it is to have the walls of the church broken down.
"This might shake people's faith for a long time," said Mrs. Clem, who led a congregation of 140 on the day of the storm. "I think that is normal. But having your faith shaken is not the same as losing it."
Ministers here believe that the churches will be more crowded than usual on Easter Sunday. Some will come for blessings, but others expect an answer.
Mrs. Clem and her husband, Dale, who is also a minister, do not believe God sent the storm that killed their daughter and 40 other people across the Southeast in a few short hours that day. The Clems make a distinction between God's laws and the laws of nature, something theologians have debated for years: what does God control, and not control?
The people here know only that they have always trusted in the kindness and mercy of God and that their neighbors died in His house while praising His name. It only strengthens the faith in some people, who believe that those who die inside any church will find the gates of heaven open wide.
Others are confused. Beyond the sadness and pain is a feeling of something lost, maybe forever.
"It was church," said Jerri Kernes, delivering flowers to a funeral home where the dead and their families filled every room.
"It isn't supposed to happen in church."
The blooming dogwood trees stand out like lace in the dark pine barrens in the hills around Piedmont. The landscape is pastoral, mountain ridges and rolling hills divided by pastures of fat cows and red-clay fields that will soon be high cotton and sweet corn.
The people, the children of farmers, mill workers, carpenters and steelworkers, now make tires at the Goodyear plant in Gadsden, spin yarn at the cotton mill and process poultry for Tyson Foods Inc., which is known here as just the chicken plant.
Yet, Piedmont, population 5,200, depending on who is home, exists in the failed economic promise of the New South. The roof on the empty brickyard has rusted through, and the pretty little train station on the Selma, Rome & Dalton line is just for show. The cotton mill just had a new round of layoffs.
As economic uncertainty grows, the people go to the altar for hope, said Vera Stewart, Piedmont's 70-year-old Mayor. Piedmont, after all, has two doctors' offices but 20 churches.
"As long as we have our faith, we are as strong as our faith," Mrs. Stewart said. "Because no matter how dark it is, if I have faith, I have a song in the night."
But in the long days since last Sunday, when the sky opened, she, too, has felt that belief tremble.
What all the troubles of the everyday failed to do, one sudden, violent moment did.
Tornadoes snapped 200-year-old trees and ruined houses and lives in five states. Goshen was the centerpiece of an agony shared by Spring Garden, Rock Run, Possum Trot, Bennefield's Gap, Knighten's Crossroad and Webster's Chapel. At Mount Gilead Church, about 10 miles from Goshen, the wind pulled tombstones from the earth and smashed them.
People here are accustomed to the damage that the winds do, but what happened at the Goshen church last Sunday was off the scale of their experience. Rescue workers found neighbors limp and broken on the ground, and strong men sobbed like babies in the arms of other men when the last of the living and dead had been dug from the rubble.
In a makeshift morgue in the National Guard Armory, one volunteer wiped the faces of the dead children before zipping up the body bags. The bags were too long, and had to be rolled up from the bottom.
But in the days after, the shock started to wear off, and the pride took hold again. So, when the truckloads of donated food and clothes arrived, some of the needy refused aid because they did not earn it with their own sweat.
Sam Goss runs a filling station, and believes in heaven the same way he believes that walking in the Coosa River will get him wet.
Mr. Goss, 49, stood in a line 50 yards long to pay respects to the dead at the town's largest funeral home. He smoked a cigarette, cried and talked of going to Glory.
He was a friend of Derek Watson, who died with his wife, Glenda Kay, and their 18-year-old daughter, Jessica. Mr. Goss said Derek, who worked at the Super Valu, had not planned to go to church that day but changed his mind.
"Maybe that's what people mean when they say God works in mysterious ways," Mr. Goss said. "I know the boy. He could not have lived if his wife and child were gone."
It is the same reason, he said, that God took both Ruth Peek, 64, and Cicero Peek, 72.
"It's hard not to question God in this," he said. "But they say there ain't no tears in heaven. We're the ones left to hurt. You see, God took them because he knew they were ready to go. He's just giving all the rest of us a second chance."
The first step toward healing might have been in a funeral processional for a child.
In life, 4-year-old Hannah Clem had been a dancer and painter and singer.
In death she has become a focus of the question why.
For three days Kelly and Dale Clem worked for their friends and parishioners and swallowed their own pain, gracious and strong. They did not shake their fist at heaven, but told Vice President Al Gore that a better storm warning system might have saved lives.
It was wind and not God, they said, that killed their daughter.
"My God is a God of hope," Mr. Clem said. "It is never his will for anyone to die."
It is a departure from the Christian mainstream belief that God controls all. But then so is Mrs. Clem herself, a female minister with a growing congregation in a small town in the Deep South.
On Wednesday, she followed Hannah's tiny white and pink casket up the aisle at the First United Methodist Church in Anniston, 20 miles from Goshen. Members of her congregation and old friends filled the church.
"People have asked, why did it happen in a church," said the Rev. Bobby Green, in his service. "There is no reason. Our faith is not determined by reason. Our faith is undergirded by belief, when there is no reason."
In the Bible, Palm Sunday is a day of destruction, not hope, he said. Hope comes later, on Easter Sunday.
The 400 mourners stood and said the Lord's Prayer. Then, Hannah's coffin was moved slowly back down the aisle to the hearse. The organist played "Jesus Loves Me."

HEADLINE: Air Pollution May Damage Food Supply In 3 Decades

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Photochemical smog, mostly from auto exhausts and factory smokestacks, could slowly reduce the amount of food grown in the world over the next 30 years, a researcher reports.
The researcher, Dr. William L. Chameides, director of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said a mathematical projection suggested that increasing ozone and smog pollution would eventually damage plants enough to cause a significant drop in the crop yields in areas that produce much of the world's food. 
 In a study published in the current issue of the journal Science, Dr. Chameides said about 60 percent of the world's damaging air pollutants were produced by North America, Europe, China and Japan. These are also the areas where about 60 percent of the world's food is produced.
"The fact that air pollution is potentially affecting such a large fraction of the food crops grown in these areas is certainly a concern," he said.
Dr. Chameides said that when ozone reaches the level of 50 to 70 parts per billion in the atmosphere, it could begin to have a serious effect on the vigor of plants. Chronic exposure to such levels can reduce agricultural production, perhaps by as much as 5 percent, he said.
In some parts of the world, like China, damaging levels of pollution could become chronic by 2025.
Though the decline in production may be only a few percentage points, Dr. Chameides said, it could come at the same time a growing world population is putting extreme demands on the food supply. A computer model developed by Dr. Chameides and his co-authors showed that the effect could be profound.
"The margin between supply and need will be more narrow then, so just a small decline in yields could be important," Dr. Chameides said.
China, he said, is self-sufficient for food, but if that country, the world's most populous, one day has to start buying on international markets, it could have a powerful effect on the cost and availability of food.
Dr. Chameides said that his computer model of the problem was based on mathematical projections and that these could change as a result of government or economic actions that affect crop yields. The model could also be affected by scientific advances, he said.
For instance, wheat and soybeans are the cereal crops most sensitive to air pollutants, Dr. Chameides said, but some varieties are more sensitive than others. This difference suggests that it may be possible to develop food plants that are resistant to damage from ozone and other air pollutants, he said.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Strains the Ties Of Administration Aides

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
The strong bond between the Treasury Department and the White House -- a link that has been central to the Clinton Administration's effort to turn the economy around -- has been strained in recent weeks by the fallout from the Whitewater investigation.
White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believe that damaging disclosures about two of the President's top advisers, George Stephanopoulos and Harold M. Ickes, were the work of Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. 
 And many Treasury officials are equally convinced that Mr. Altman took too much of the early blame for participating in a White House discussion of the investigation by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency he heads that is charged with unraveling the savings and loans collapses.
Mr. Altman, who once routinely roamed the halls of the White House to attend various meetings about economic strategy and health care, has spent more time lately with lawyers. He flatly denies that he leaked any damaging information about White House officials.
 
'Inappropriate' Conversation
 But the suspicion has taken at least shallow root in the Administration because of the workings of the grand jury that is investigating the Government's oversight of Madison Guaranty, the failed Arkansas savings and loan owned by James B. McDougal, a former Clinton business partner. Several Administration officials have acknowledged holding "inappropriate" conversations related to the matter at a time when the Resolution Trust Company was investigating Madison.
Morale and trust have been undermined at Treasury and the White House, officials at both said. Leaks to the press have been traced and speculated upon with an intensity that belies the calm that officials seek to project.
One piece of evidence: President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen discussed the frayed relationship as they flew on Air Force One to Dallas last weekend.
And in the hallways of the White House, senior officials who used to casually pick up the telephone or stop to chat with Treasury officials in the West Wing now hesitate before they make a call, and avert their eyes when they see a colleague coming who may have testified before the grand jury. One official said, "There is a much higher level of distrust, and it's affecting the way people deal with each other."
 
'Bearing Up Pretty Well'
 But as the distance between officials working in two buildings separated only by a narrow street has grown, some senior officials have said that the current flurry of finger-pointing will not cause lasting damage.
"I think it's understandable that in the last few weeks there's been a fair amount of stress on the White House, on people who serve there," David R. Gergen, the counselor to the President, said this week. "I think people are bearing up pretty well under the circumstances."
Much is at stake. Treasury and White House officials, who worked together closely to mount successful campaigns last year on behalf of the Administration's economic plan, the North American Free Trade agreement and on trade policies toward Japan and China, still have a full plate.
This week, Mr. Bentsen met with officials about Treasury's role on the gun-control provisions of the crime bill, and on Monday, Mr. Altman will resume his seat at the health care strategy planning sessions run by Mr. Ickes.
Top officials, including Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Altman and Mr. Stephanopoulos, have been trying to clear the air through intermediaries.
"I think the White House knows that the Treasury is totally supportive," Mr. Altman said in an interview.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said: "As far as I'm concerned, we're still a team. We're still a close team. We're a team that produced a lot."
Accounts of the contacts provided by Mr. Altman and Joshua Steiner, Mr. Bentsen's chief of staff, have often conflicted not only with each other but also with more benign interpretations offered by White House officials like Mr. Stephanopoulos.
"The feeling before all this was that Treasury was working like clockwork," one official said. "There were problems at Justice, Defense and State, but not at Treasury. Now that's not the case. The collegiality is all gone."
 
'Everybody Is Skittish'
 One White House official complained that personal friends were now "setting up Chinese walls in private conversations." Another said, "Everybody is skittish."
Mr. Clinton has offered blanket support for his advisers, following a script the White House has used in other tight spots, in which the President admits that mistakes were made but says that they were neither venal nor intentional. And Hillary Rodham Clinton telephoned Mr. Altman after he recused himself from the Madison investigation to assure him that he would survive the adversity.
Mr. Bentsen has maintained an artful distance from his wayward aides, offering support for them when pressed, but ordering up an ethics investigation into their behavior nonetheless.
"It did not make me happy, I can assure you of that," Mr. Bentsen said of the series of missteps. "But I also understand these things happen. I have been around here a long time."
Part of the reason the uneasiness has continued to flourish is that Mr. Robert B. Fiske Jr., the special counsel investigating the Whitewater affair, has asked White House and Treasury officials to hold off on their own internal investigations so as not to taint the grand jury inquiry.
Mr. Bentsen demonstrated his concern about the growing perception that he is in charge of a fractured agency on Friday when he summoned reporters to his office to defend his staff and insist that business is continuing as usual at Treasury.
 
Backing for an Aide
 The Secretary said Jean Hanson, the general counsel to Treasury who told White House lawyers about an R.T.C. recommendation to begin a criminal investigation on Madison, has "a wonderful reputation for integrity and ability." He would not dismiss her for her mistake, Mr. Bentsen said, "unless there's more than I know now."
Mr. Altman, the Secretary said, "is very bright and a hard worker" and Mr. Steiner "has done a hell of a job."
Mr. Steiner, Mr. Bentsen said, told him of his telephone conversation with Mr. Stephanopoulos about Jay B. Stephens, a Republican prosecutor who was hired by the R.T.C. to conduct part of the Madison investigation. And Mr. Altman, he said, assured him he had never leaked information damaging to the White House.
Officials insist that while the atmosphere may be poisoned, policy making has not been derailed. "Clearly things are more tense than before," one senior official said. "But this kind of stuff can tear departments apart, and that's not happening at all."

HEADLINE: Eugene Keilin Emerges From Rohatyn's Shadow

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
At a farewell dinner last fall for Felix G. Rohatyn, one staff member rose to pay tribute to the man who led the State Municipal Assistance Corporation from its birth in 1975, when New York City's fiscal crisis first erupted.
"As far as I'm concerned," she said, "Bruce Springsteen will always be the Boss, and Felix Rohatyn will always be the chairman of M.A.C." 
 Surprisingly, Eugene J. Keilin, who was chosen by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to replace Mr. Rohatyn, actually enjoys telling the story.
"I'm like George Selkirk, the guy who took Babe Ruth's place in right field at Yankee Stadium," Mr. Keilin said. "Nobody remembers his name."
Much as he might like to avoid George Selkirk's fate, Mr. Keilin (pronounced KAY-lynn) faces a daunting challenge.
 
A Different Era
 Even under Mr. Rohatyn -- who had enormous personal clout because of his reputation as a savior of New York City -- the influence of the agency was already waning. Set up by New York State to help the city avoid bankruptcy in the 1970's, the agency remained important through the 80's primarily because it found itself in control of billions of dollars in excess funds from sales-tax receipts that the city craved.
Now, with its decision to release the $200 million surplus it held, the agency appears close to its last hurrah.
"My impression is that M.A.C. has relatively few bullets left," said Donald Kummerfeld, a former first deputy mayor who held several important fiscal posts and is still prominent in New York City affairs. "It's not out of business, but M.A.C. has already done for the city, for better or worse, most of what it could do."
That doesn't mean Mr. Keilin, 51, is about to give up. Already well-known within the tight circles of New York City fiscal experts, he recently emerged from obscurity by publicly questioning Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's policy of largely exempting the police and fire departments from budget cuts.
 
'Nobody Elected Him'
 In the past, when Mr. Rohatyn scolded mayors and the municipal unions about what he considered the city's free-spending ways, his victims usually held their tongues. But this time, the Mayor blasted right back.
"It isn't his role or M.A.C.'s role to be suggesting the budget priorities or political priorities of the city," Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference recently. "Nobody elected him to make determinations like that."
Although the agency no longer has the authority to intervene directly in the budget process, it controls the $200 million surplus that Mr. Giuliani needs for his ambitious severance program to eliminate about half the 15,000 jobs he plans to cut in the next 15 months. On Friday, the M.A.C. agreed to release the surplus, with the condition that the city repay the money if the Mayor does not manage to slash the 15,000 jobs.
Like Mr. Rohatyn, his long-time mentor, Mr. Keilin is no stranger to controversy, having played an important backstage role in prior budget battles. But unlike the vocal Mr. Rohatyn -- who was not elected to anything either -- Mr. Keilin says he does not plan to seek it out.
"I don't think you'll see me looking for a spotlight," Mr. Keilin said in a recent interview. "But I don't think you'll see me hiding from it if it focuses on me."
 
Behind the Scenes
 For nearly two decades, Mr. Keilin has worked in the shadow of Mr. Rohatyn. A young lawyer in the city budget office when the fiscal crisis began in the mid-1970's, Mr. Keilin represented New York City in its early negotiations with New York State and the M.A.C. He was plucked from that post by Mr. Rohatyn and given the top staff position at the assistance corporation.
With Mr. Rohatyn out front and Mr. Keilin working on the details behind the scenes, the agency helped nurse the city through intensive care.
"I remember we were outside City Hall one day standing next to my BMW, which was kind of beat up," Mr. Rohatyn recalled. "A reporter came up to us and was a bit surprised: 'The Batman and Robin of New York City ride around in that Batmobile?' he said. We thought that was rich."
After two years, Mr. Keilin was offered a job with Lazard Freres & Company, the investment-banking firm where Mr. Rohatyn reigns as the most prominent partner. Mr. Keilin joined the nine-member board of the M.A.C. under Mr. Rohatyn's chairmanship and became a Lazard partner himself in 1984, specializing in employee takeovers of companies at risk of going under.
Mr. Keilin left Lazard in 1990 to set up an investment-banking firm with Ronald Bloom, another Lazard partner, that has carved out a role in advising unions on corporate restructurings and bankruptcies.
 
'Gene Was the One Constant'
 In that position, he has demonstrated what friends and supporters say is probably his greatest strength: patience.
Charles N. Goldstein, the lawyer for the United Airlines' pilots, who are nearing the end of a long struggle by employees to acquire the company, said: "During the almost seven-year-long effort, Gene was the one constant. He never gave in and never gave up."
Mayor Giuliani may have slapped down Mr. Keilin's first effort to serve as a bridge between City Hall and the unions, but his persistence could still hold him in good stead.
"I had chalked up some useful experience and was thinking about going back to the private sector when the fiscal crisis first started to appear in 1974," Mr. Keilin said. "Everybody said to get out. Bankruptcy is not a nice thing to have on your resume. But I believe you don't leave the ship when it's in trouble."
Mr. Keilin says he shares many of Mr. Giuliani's economic views and also believes sacrifice by public employees is needed. But he argues that everyone -- including the police, firefighters and teachers -- must share the burden to avoid harsh cutbacks.
A soft-spoken man with a well-trimmed gray beard, Mr. Keilin carefully chooses his words, a habit honed from years of practice in the often highly charged atmosphere of city politics and management-union negotiations.
He has none of Mr. Rohatyn's public aura to rely on as a shield. Yet he cannot be easily dismissed, simply because he holds one of the state's most prominent offices and serves as an important pipeline from Albany to the city. And his knowledge and experience could make a big difference as New York continues to struggle with its fiscal problems.
"Gene is a pro," Mr. Kummerfeld said. "The Mayor would be crazy to ignore him."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
D'Amato's Diction Backfires With Greek Americans

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
George Stephanopoulos has taken his lumps as President Clinton's adviser -- most recently for a heated conversation with a top Treasury Department official over an investigation into the failed savings and loan at the center of the Whitewater affair.
But his critics mess with this prominent Greek-American's patrimony at their peril, as Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato recently learned. Discussing the White House's efforts to portray his inquiries into Whitewater as mere partisan politics, the Senator from New York last month repeatedly and pointedly mispronounced the names of several Clinton aides, including Mr. Stephanopoulos's, which came out "Steppin' ah-full-us." 
 That did not go down well with some Greek Americans who had long viewed Mr. D'Amato as a friend. Greek organizations beseiged the Senator with protests defending the honor of Mr. Stephanopoulos, who is descended from a prominent family of Greek Orthodox priests and whose father is the dean of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in New York.
"Greek Americans feel strongly about the respect that should be shown for another's sacred legacy from their ancestry -- their family name," Archbishop Iakovos, primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America, said in a statement. "It is particularly disrespectful to ridicule a family which has for generations brought honor and distinction to its name."
Andrew Manatos, head of a Washington consulting firm that represents Greek-American groups, said Mr. D'Amato had insisted that he meant no offense.
Andrew Manatos, head of a Washington consulting firm that represents Greek-American groups, said Mr. D'Amato had insisted that he meant no offense. "The Senator has been smoothing things over," he said.
 
Queens Wins Contest For U.S. Office Building
 The tug of war over a new regional heaquarters for the Food and Drug Administration has been won by Queens, ending an interborough rivalry over 300 permanent jobs.
The new building is to be on the site of a parking lot at York College in Jamaica. Representative Floyd H. Flake and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan had sponsored an appropriation for the project in the budget last year -- but only for that site.
Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn cried foul, since the lab and headquarters have been on the Brooklyn waterfront for years. City University, York College's parent, balked at losing 275 parking spaces. But after Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens agreed to find other spaces, the CUNY Board tentatively approved the deal last month.
The Senator insisted no favoritism was at work, only an effort to help one of the more economically distressed areas of the city.
Several years ago, Mr. Moynihan got a new regional Social Security office for Jamaica, one of New York's oldest settlements.
"Jamaica was Jamaica before Brooklyn was Brooklyn," he said.
 
Politics of Inclusion Includes Council Minorities
 Speaker Peter F. Vallone has long had as strong a hold on his City Council membership as any legislative leader, but as the Council grows ever more diverse, he is taking no chances. Last week, he announced the appointment of four members of the Council's black and Hispanic caucus to new committee chairmanships.
Council aides said the new jobs were intended to inspire loyalty in the approaching vote on the municipal budget, which some minority members have threatened to challenge because of Mr. Giuliani's proposed cuts in social services.
Mr. Vallone named Juanita E. Watkins of Queens to head the subcommittee on women and Una Clarke of Brooklyn to head the subcommittee on mental health. He also created two new panels, one on youth violence to be led by Lawrence A. Warden of the Bronx and another on abandonment, foreclosure and disinvestment, to be run by Antonio Pagan, an openly gay member from the Lower East Side.
"All of these subcommittees were formed," Mr. Vallone said in a statement, "to focus more attention on pressing social problems."
 
City's Only Big Enough For One Top Crime-Fighter
 A postscript on President Clinton's visit to Brooklyn last month, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision not to join him for a talk-show style discussion of crime there:
When the White House first started planning the event, an official there called Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, who said he would be delighted to attend, said a top city official familiar with the exchanges.
Then the White House official called Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, told him how much the White House hoped the Mayor would join the President, and mentioned in passing that of course, Mr. Bratton was a national leader in crime-fighting. To which Mr. Powers coolly replied, the city official said, that the only national leader in crime fighting in New York was Mr. Giuliani himself.
Mr. Giuliani eventually met with the President at his hotel.

HEADLINE: Another Round of Humbling for the Men of Harvard;
Women Have Been There

 BODY:
"The Humbling of the Harvard Man" (March 6), Louis Uchitelle's report on the men of the Harvard class of 1958 who have fallen on hard times, drew a large response from readers. Some offered advice, some lamented the demise of corporate loyalty, some drew parallels to the hurdles faced by a generation of professional women. Running through many of the letters, however, was a bitterness toward institutions like Harvard and a sense that arrogance and privilege had received just retribution.
 
To the Editor: 
 Having recently published a novel about the class of '58 at Sarah Lawrence College, I read with interest your article on the men of Harvard's class of 1958. I saw it as the male version of what happened to the women of my generation.
The men you profiled have taken an economic hit they couldn't have foreseen -- not to mention a cruel loss of status and bashing of their self-esteem. We women haven't fallen nearly so far partly because most of us never attained the career pinnacle to fall from. True, after graduating college, the rebels among us pursued some form of work, though the culture trumpeted that marriage and family alone could offer a woman fulfillment. However, only a minority pursued seriously remunerative careers with a long-term payoff. We took jobs that offered a second income that would complement a husband's -- became teachers, writers, jewelry designers, toilers in the fields of not-for-profit; we rarely conceived of a job as something that might have to support not only us, but also -- as it happened when marriages dissolved in the 70's -- our children.
Though we haven't, like the men, gotten "tumbled out" of Corporate America, we share some of their problems, while incurring heavy-duty ones of our own. We face the same age discrimination, in spades, as in magazine writing, where Generation X appears to be running the show.
Unlike Harvard '58, though, few of us can count on pensions or severance; except for married women and those with family money or fat divorce settlements, few can contemplate a "comfortable" retirement with a home on Marco Island. As well, the beleaguered Harvard grads probably have long-suffering -- maybe second -- wives who offer not only that now essential second income, but companionship and solidarity. Compare the divorced women from '58 who are struggling to survive on their own without the emotional cushioning of a partner that might ease the slings of fortune. Still, since our career expectations were so much lower -- and certainly newer -- perhaps we're less shellshocked than our male counterparts. We've had postgraduate schooling in resilience.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: THE ROCKAWAYS;
Visions Of Casinos Return to the Beach

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Casino advocates say they sense a real chance of legalizing gambling in the state, and as the discussion picks up in Albany, it's also picking up in the Rockaways.
"The Rockaways is ideal, with that largest strip of unused property right on the boardwalk, two airports and major highways," said Councilman Alfonso C. Stabile, who represents the western Rockaways. Vincent Castellano, chairman of Community Board 14, says the board is likely to review the issue soon. 
 And State Senator Alton Waldon Jr. said that he supports the move toward legalization and that the Rockaways would be a good location. He said he would be guided by the results of a poll he intends to conduct in the area.
But whether political reality will ever allow casinos in the area remains unclear. The last time the idea of casinos in the Rockaways -- an area with an oceanfront site, depressed economy and, perhaps above all, a vast stretch of vacant land -- got serious attention was in the 1970's. The idea faded when Albany stood firm on laws banning casinos.
Opposition has significantly eased since a 1988 Federal law permitted gambling on Indian reservations. In upstate New York, the first such casino has opened, a second is planned and a third is being considered. Access to casinos upstate and in Atlantic City and Connecticut reduces the effectiveness of the New York ban, and enhances the lure for New York to get in on the business and tax revenue.
"Rockaway has hit bottom, and we have to put something there," said Mr. Stabile. "It has very little industry, very little business. Casinos would be a shot in the arm."
The political process for change is complex. A constitutional amendment must be approved by two separately elected State Legislatures and adopted by a statewide referendum. The earliest that could be completed is next year.
And some key officials still oppose casinos for the Rockaways. They include Queens Borough President Claire Shulman and City Councilwoman Juanita Watkins, whose district includes a 300-acre site in Arverne, which advocates say would be ideal for a casino.
One other possible wrinkle is an Indian claim on the Arverne site. Chief Osceola Townsend of the Matinecock Nation of Queens and Long Island contends it is ancestral Indian land, and he threatens to sue if anyone attempts to open a casino there without including his people in the project. But the Matinecocks are not officially recognized as a tribe and have never gone to court to enforce their other land claims. B.L.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LEFFERTS GARDEN;
Testing a Definition of Family

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
A century ago, the heirs of Pieterse Lefferts, a wealthy Dutch immigrant who was granted his vast land holdings by Peter Stuyvesant in 1661, carved up a piece of their farmland and built stately Victorian homes for affluent Brooklyn residents.
In the face of increasing immigration and a shifting economy, a covenant to keep out boarders and renters was established between the remaining Lefferts heirs and new home buyers: only single-family houses could be constructed, and only families could live in them. The community changed in the 1950's and 60's as black families began to move in and whites moved out, but the covenant, bolstered by zoning laws, held. As of today, with three-quarters of its residents black, the community remains solidly composed of middle-class single-family homeowners. 
 Now, though, the covenant is facing its first real challenge, and the community group that represents the area is prepared to go to court to defend it.
Catholic Charities, a large social services agency, is trying to buy a home for four unrelated women.
The organization argues that the women, who are mentally retarded and developmentally disabled, are like family to one another, having lived together since childhood just two blocks from their proposed new home, said Margaret Keaveney, a spokeswoman.
"We really don't see how this can be a violation of the covenant if we're buying the home for a family," she said.
But the home, a $190,000 three-story brick and limestone building at 156 Midwood Street, would be purchased by Catholic Charities and not the individuals themselves, she said.
If the sale goes through, Catholic Charities would be the first agency to sidestep the covenant and possibly open the door for other social service agencies to enter the community.
The covenant "is what people are buying into and this is what our association is mandated to protect," said Stephen McGill, president of the Lefferts Manor Association. "If you paid a premium because you wanted to live in a certain neighborhood and it changed, you would be upset."
The covenant, which covers an eight-block area of 600 homes south of Crown Heights and east of Prospect Park, was written into the original deeds of the homeowners, Mr. McGill said. The validity of the covenant was upheld in State Supreme Court in 1950 when a couple was ordered not to open their home to boarders. And in 1979, the city zoned the area for single-family homes, reinforcing the community's covenant.
Community Board 9, which represents the area, approved Catholic Charities' use of the house almost two weeks ago at its monthly meeting. The board's chairman, Rabbi Jacob Z. Goldstein, said he was unaware that it violated the community's covenant or zoning laws and that he would look into it. He said public hearings were held and that the issues were never raised.
"The public hearing was heavily attended, and this matter never came up," Rabbi Goldstein said. "The fact that no representatives from this particular community were there concerns me."
Mr. McGill said representatives from the association were not at the hearing because they did not know about it.
"We were misinformed about this whole process," Mr. McGill said. "The community board is supposed to represent us and so far no one is willing to help us through this." L.H.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER MANHATTAN;
Staten Island Ferry Revives a Battle of Boroughs

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE 

 BODY:
The Staten Island Ferry will resume transporting vehicles by late May, officials say, and like other interborough issues, views on the matter are divided according to which side of the water one is standing on. To Staten Island leaders, car ferries are a blessing in an area with limited mass transit; to some public officials in Manhattan, they cause congestion and pollution.
On March 21, Mayor Giuliani announced his decision to restore car ferry service to Staten Island. The service was suspended after a fire damaged the Whitehall Ferry Terminal in lower Manhattan in 1991. Mayor Dinkins made the suspension permanent the next year to discourage people from driving into Manhattan. 
 In reversing the decision, Mayor Giuliani may be conducting a bit of a political payback. In the 1993 Mayoral elections, Staten Island delivered a plurality of more than 88,000 votes to Mr. Giuliani, who won the election by 50,000, while Manhattan gave Mr. Dinkins a plurality of 73,000 votes.
 Also looming large for the Mayor is Staten Island's movement to secede from the city. Although reviving car ferries may not slow the campaign, the service has been an issue, said Guy V. Molinari, Staten Island Borough President and a supporter of secession. "There are many far greater issues, but the administration is being more sensitive to Staten Island," he said.
Previously about 1,000 vehicles entered Manhattan daily by taking the 20-minute ferry ride, said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation. Agency studies show that people have continued to drive into Manhattan, she said, but by the Gowanus Expressway and local streets through Brooklyn, "polluting the air even more than when they crossed the ferry with the ignition off." The trip, via the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, can take up to an hour.
Elliott G. Sander, the Transportation Commissioner, initially opposed a return to car ferries but now supports the idea. He said at a recent town hall meeting on Staten Island that its residents have fewer ways to reach Manhattan than the other boroughs.
The new service could delay by about six months the $112 million plan to renovate the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, to begin in 1996. Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, said the design must now make space for 40 vehicles queuing up on the plaza. Such changes could cost about $500,000, she said.
For now, new controls are being put in place at two ferry slips to enable vehicle loading in May. Officials are also studying the fare structure. Mr. Molinari has proposed a $1 fare increase, to $3 a car, for a projected revenue of $1 million that would cover an anticipated deficit of $405,000 in ferry operations next year and pay for the service.
Ruth W. Messinger, Manhattan Borough President and a vigorous Dinkins supporter, has been a vocal opponent of the service. "It's bad for traffic, bad for the environment and bad urban planning," she said.
One of the principal objections on the Manhattan side is that car ferries will disrupt plans for a pedestrian esplanade from Battery Park City to the South Street Seaport. Concerned that pedestrians will "lose the plaza," Kathryn Freed, City Councilwoman for lower Manhattan, said: "It just shows that Staten Island's interests are more important than Manhattan's. I'm fed up; we should secede." MARVINE HOWE

HEADLINE: Older People and the Need for Assistance

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
IF we live long enough, many of us will fit the profile of an older person: living alone, independent, with mental faculties intact but having a need for stimulation and possibly requiring some physical assistance to perform routine chores.
Now there is help for older people who want to remain independent but yearn to live richer lives. Selfhelp Community Services, a 58-year-old nonprofit agency, has started a household-manager program to bridge the gap between companionship and traditional home care, said Elizabeth N. Radow, the program's director. 
 "The first household-manager program was opened in White Plains last September to provide services to help improve the quality of aging residents of Westchester," Ms. Radow said. "A similar program was opened in Manhattan in November."
The population of Westchester is getting older. Quoting 1990 census figures, Ms. Radow said, "There are 33,400 people older than 65 listed as living alone in Westchester. And the number of people 85 and older was 14,104, which represents 35.9 percent growth over the 1980 census." The household-manager program, she said, is a logical extension of Selfhelp's existing services for older people.
 
Giving Something in Return
 Selfhelp Community Services, she said, was begun in 1936 by refugees from Nazi Germany to help other refugees find jobs, homes and schools in American communities.
"Over the years, Selfhelp's programs were expanded, and services were extended to the community at large," Ms. Radow said. This came about "because of the strong desire of those who once were refugees to return something to everyone in the community for the support they received when they first came to the United States."
Today, Selfhelp Community Services is one of the major nonprofit geriatric and home-care social agencies in the New York City area, offering programs at six centers for the elderly, which they operate, and four apartment houses, which they own and operate in Queens, in addition to offering services to individuals in their own homes. The average age of those in the apartments is 80.
Some of the Selfhelp programs are offered free to Holocaust survivors, but other programs, like the new household-manager program, are offered on a fee basis. Selfhelp receives financial support from U.J.A.-Federation and other philanthropic agencies along with donations and government funds for certain programs, Ms. Radow said, adding that Selfhelp's overhead costs are among the lowest in the field of elder care.
 
Trained Companions Offered
 Regarding the household-manager program, Ms. Radow said it is a fee-for-service program priced at $16 an hour during the week with a minimum of two hours. "But most all of the fee, $10 plus $2 for Social Security and unemployment, goes to the employee," she said. "The remainder, $4, goes to offset our overhead costs. We haven't reached the break-even stage yet, but we hope that over time we will be able to sustain ourselves."
What the household manager program provides are trained companions who deliver a variety of services to people in their own homes.
"Because the success of the program is largely dependent on the caliber of the companion, companions are chosen very carefully," Ms. Radow said. "They can be student nurses, free-lance writers, homemakers, office workers, retired executives -- but all of them have the ability to do what may be required of them, which can include such things as reading aloud and discussing current events, assisting with paying bills, walking a dog or shopping, preparing and serving lunch to a bridge club. However, one prerequisite is that the companion has to own and drive a car. In Westchester, especially, what many people need is transportation to stores, to see the doctor or even to the theater."
Ms. Radow, a real estate lawyer, has been a member of the New York State Bar Association special committee on seniors and has published a report on housing for the elderly. She was a member of Selfhelp's executive board when she was chosen to head the household-management program.
"I was enthusiastic about taking the job because I feel that this is an exceptional, unusual home-care service, and as far as I know there is nothing like it in the area," she said. "I do the interviewing myself," she added, explaining that candidates' backgrounds and references are checked thoroughly before the applicants are sent to Selfhelp's Guthery Institute in Manhattan where they take a 40-hour certification course in personal care.
 
'I Saw the Difficult Time'
 Cynthia M. Brill of Thornwood, one of the first people hired as a companion, formerly worked as an office manager in a family business.
"It was my father's company, and after he sold it and retired, I saw the difficult time and loneliness he was experiencing before he passed away," Mrs. Brill said. "It made me realize that many older people really could use something else, and that made me very receptive to becoming part of the household management program."
Mrs. Brill, who has found it more fulfilling to work one-on-one with people than in an office, said: "Every case is different. For instance, I drive one woman who broke her shoulder in a fall on the ice this winter to her physical therapist three times a week. I also walk her dog, take her to the grocery store and do whatever tasks in and around the house are necessary. And for an older client, whose eyesight is bad, I go in twice a week to read to her. She loves to know what's going on and is so eager to talk about things. We discussed the Tonya Harding affair in detail, and now I'm reading her Bette Davis's autobiography, which she seems to enjoy immensely."
One of Mrs. Brill's clients, a woman who broke her arm and agreed to be interviewed only on the condition of anonymity, said: "Cindy is a treasure. It is such a help for me to have her here. She is like a good friend."
Myra Doniger, who lives in Greenwich, has an elderly mother-in-law who lives in Purchase, and she, too, is enthusiastic about the household-manager program.
"My mother-in-law has a housekeeper, so our concern was not so much for her physical care, but it was our feeling that because she had very little mental stimulation the quality of her life was sadly diminished," Mrs. Doniger said. "She was always such an active, independent woman, who was constantly on the go, that when we heard about the companion program we decided to give it a try."
Just having someone to read the newspaper aloud, Mrs. Doniger said, has made a noticeable difference in her mother-in-law's life.
"Now that she has company, she seems much more animated and happier. What do they read? Mainly the society pages of The New York Times, especially the marriages, the charity affairs and, oh, then the obituaries. But it's more than companionship that Selfhelp provides. Companions are trained to be observant and to contact us if they spot any physical change in my mother-in-law that we should know about. And that is very reassuring."
 
Cost Sharing
 Too often, older people become homebound when they are unable to drive, Ms. Radow said. "Having transportation available helps them lead fuller lives," she said. "For example, if a woman wants to have her friends over for lunch and bridge, the companion will not only call for the friends and take them back home, but shop, prepare the lunch, clean up, everything. And if four friends share the cost of having the companion, each pays $6.50 an hour."
And for two people who want to go shopping or perhaps to the theater together, the fee is $10.50 an hour for each, she said.
"It's often the children of our clients who seek out and pay for our services," she said. "They feel that by helping their parents stay independent, they are giving them a great gift."
For more information, Selfhelp's telephone number is 684-1200.

Forgotten Heroes
IT is no coincidence that Joseph G. Bilby writes about unsung heroes. A veteran of the Vietnam War, he called his latest book "Forgotten Warriors: New Jersey's African American Soldiers in the Civil War" and dedicated it to the men of the First Infantry Division with whom he served from August 1966 to August 1967. 
 "I've wanted to honor neglected phases of New Jersey history long before Vietnam," said Mr. Bilby, a resident of Wall Township, in Monmouth County. He recalled how as an 8-year-old visiting his grandparents' graves in Mount Olive, in Morris County, he discovered the grave of a Civil War veteran, Abraham Sowers, who died a few days before Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865.
"Imagine my surprise to learn when I visited the Newark Public Library four years later that a Morris County relative, George H. Bilby, a cousin to my grandfather, served in the same fighting regiment -- the 15th New Jersey -- as Sowers," Mr. Bilby said.
Mr. Bilby's first book, "Three Rousing Cheers: A History of the 15th New Jersey Infantry From Flemington to Appomattox" ($36), is itself a surprise. After the war ended, laudatory regiment histories emerged as a matter of tradition, but this author writes with a candor permissible after the passage of almost 130 years.
The book, taking its title from a contemporary song, opens on Aug. 8, 1862, with a recruitment scene at what was then Camp Fair Oaks at the still extant Flemington Fairgrounds -- one of the many gatherings held throughout the state and sponsored by prominent citizens who, the author writes, "had no intention of entering the army themselves." Mr. Bilby says they appealed to local pride, exploited the fear of a possible draft and pledged bounty money to the volunteers.
While the 947 soldiers mostly "accepted the correctness of their cause," many, like his grandfather's cousin, an unemployed carpenter, sought escape from economic woes.
In less than three years, 240 soldiers died -- more casualties than in any other unit in the state and 12th in losses among the country's 2,000 Union regiments.
The courageous facts of history remain, but the distinction of "Three Rousing Cheers" is that its intimate profiles of the volunteers who became seasoned fighters reconstruct a war that seems to have happened yesterday.
"Forgotten Warriors" ($7.95, paper), which is Mr. Bilby's second book, is a valuable start that encourages further research into a particularly poignant omission of black history.
Until 1863 -- two years after the outbreak of hostilities -- New Jersey black men "who wanted to fight had to look elsewhere," because the state's officials ignored their military potential, Mr. Bilby writes, adding that apparently 2,782 black "Jerseymen" served in the Union cause. He cites particularly First Sgt. George Ashby of Allentown, in Monmouth County, and of the 45th United States Colored Infantry -- still alert at 100 in 1944 and following the news of World War II.
Since 1980, Mr. Bilby has worked as an investigator for the Department of Labor in Trenton, a job that no doubt honed his skills at unearthing the letters, diaries, memoirs, photos and official records that pack these histories.
His publisher, Longstreet House in Hightstown, prints books only about the Civil War and New Jersey history. The firm, said its editor, Dr. David G. Martin, is named for the New Jersey branch of the Longstreet family famed for a Confederate general, James Longstreet.
 
Poetry Celebration
 When does a magazine stop resembling a magazine? Look to The Quarterly Review of Literature, based in Princeton, for the answer.
Now 50 years old, it has not been a quarterly 1968, despite the name. It is an annual poetry publication that awards $1,000 each to four to six poets and then combines the winners' books in one volume, which is sold by subscription, at $20 a year.
The Review pokes holes in the notion that married couples wisely do not work together; its co-editors, Theodore Weiss and Renee Karol Weiss, married in 1941. He taught English and creative writing at Princeton University from 1968 to 1986 and is the author of 12 books of poems; she, a violinist and author of children's books, also writes poetry.
Mr. Weiss described the publication's beginnings as "the experience of piloting a literary cargo" through perilous waters. What came forth is an influential literary publication that has printed the work of many famous poets and provided a voice to those less well known like James Dickey, John Gardner, W. S. Merwin and James Wright.
All this permanence called for a celebration -- a continuing one, to be sure -- first with "Quarterly Review of Literature: 50th Anniversary Anthology," a 576-page collection of new poems by Review winners, representing 15 countries, along with a selection of poems previously printed ($40; $20 paper from QRL, 26 Haslet Avenue, Princeton 08540). Next came a series of events to end with a program and reception at the New School in Manhattan on April 26 at 8 P.M. Admission is $5.
 
Colorful Folk Tale
 When "Marushka's Egg" is read on the White House lawn today, it will be the second Easter in a row for this lively Russian folk tale for children, written by Elsa Okon Real and illustrated by Joanna Wezyk, who also stages a puppet show to accompany the reading.
For Ms. Wezyk, a 28-year-old resident of Elizabeth, who left her family in Poland to arrive alone in the United States five years ago, the honor holds special meaning because "my strong desire to illustrate books brought me here," she said.
In 1989, she received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Cracow with a major in children's book art. But she said she was discouraged by the inferior paper and the insistence on black-and-white drawings in her native land.
"Marushka's Egg" revels in color. The vivid story (Macmillan, $14.95) features doll-like Marushka and her captor, Baba Yaga, a wily witch and probably the best-known character in East European folklore. Ms. Wezyk uses, she said, "memories of artwork I cherish from my childhood" in her festive -- indeed, more festive than scary -- depictions of Baba Yaga, whose forest house stands on chicken legs and who gets around in a flying mortar and pestle.
But whence the inspiration for the image of Marushka? Well, that's another story. Soon after arriving in Elizabeth, Ms. Wezyk worked as a nanny for the Harms family in East Brunswick, and the rosy-cheeked, golden-haired Marushka, who finally triumphs over Baba Yaga, was, she said, modeled after Chrissie Harms -- "the little girl I loved taking care of."

CORRESPONDENCE
THE LAST WORD
Letters Between Marcia Nardi
and William Carlos Williams.
Edited by Elizabeth Murrie O'Neil.
University of Iowa,
cloth, $34.95; paper, $16.95. 
 In 1942, the poet Marcia Nardi consulted William Carlos Williams in his medical office, and for several months afterward they corresponded. Williams was then 59 and had not yet received full recognition as a poet. Nardi was unpublished and unemployed, with a troublesome 15-year-old son. She wrote eloquently and despairingly about being an unwed mother, being forced to accept menial labor to support herself and her son. Williams was sympathetic and tried to console her; however, Nardi's letters grew ever more demanding, to the point where Williams finally broke off the correspondence. Crushed, Nardi continued to write to him to plead her case as a woman, a poet and a legitimate claimant to Williams's aid and attention. Williams published two of these letters in his 1946 book-length poem, "Patterson," and lost track of Nardi. In 1949 she saw the book in a store and wrote to Williams asking for a copy, enclosing 20 new poems. Williams was enthusiastic about them and their correspondence resumed, on friendlier terms. Williams helped Nardi to get published and to get grants. She soon was writing at greater and greater length, making more and more outrageous appeals. Nardi, who died in 1990, was a Dickensian character of astonishing proportions, but also a poet of merit. The independent scholar Elizabeth Murrie O'Neil's collection of the correspondence, "The Last Word," does justice to what was not merely a literary footnote but a stunted, tragic career.

HEADLINE: After Winning Years, A Pioneer Bows Out

BYLINE: By MARY CUMMINGS 

 BODY:
WINE is a small glamour industry on eastern Long Island, and news of shifts and shakeouts in the business travel quickly. There are 17 wineries on the East End, with 3 on the South Fork. So when Lyle Greenfield offered his Bridgehampton Winery for sale in February, he knew that the word would "fly through the grapevine faster than electric current," as he put it.
Even outside the industry interest has been high. Mr. Greenfield was a pioneer on the South Fork, planting his first vines in 1979 and building the first winery in the Hamptons, in 1982. A past president of the Long Island Wine Council, he is known as a tireless promoter of Long Island wines and a hands-on vintner. 
 His decision to call it quits after 15 years inevitably raises questions about the viability of wine making in the Hamptons.
Doubters were reminded that two years ago another South Fork winery fell on hard times. In 1992, Barclays Bank foreclosed on Alan Barr's Le Reve Winery in Water Mill. After changing the name to the Southampton Winery, the bank continued operations while seeking a buyer.
Last month the owner of the largest vineyard on Long Island, Pindar Vineyards in Peconic on the North Fork, Dr. Herodotus Damianos of Stony Brook, announced the purchase of the imposing chateau-style winery and 56 acres of vineyards.
If that venture proves successful, it will be another encouraging development on the South Fork, where Sagpond Vineyards in Sagaponack, is adding acreage to cultivate grapes this year and where the owner, Christian Wolffer, is building what he calls a "state of the art winery."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Greenfield, who is seeking a buyer willing to pay $228,000 for his winery business with an option to buy the buildings and a four-acre site for an additional $390,000, aligns himself with the optimists. In an interview he stressed his continued confidence in the South Fork potential to produce high-end wines and acknowledged mistakes and miscalculations as an agricultural entrepreneur.
 
Open House for Potential Buyers
 Mr. Greenfield, who spends his weekends in the Hamptons and weekdays in New York City overseeing Bang Music, which produces jingles for commercials, was in Bridgehampton early last month preparing to greet potential buyers at a two-day open house.
He acknowledged that he knew since the summer that he would have to put the winery on the market, but that it would have been "detrimental to my business to discuss it in the middle of the season."
Mr. Greenfield was no longer growing grapes. The winery, which had made up to 4,000 cases a year at its peak, had ceased production. The 1992 vintage was the last bottled by Mr. Greenfield and his wine maker, Richard Olsen-Harbich, who worked with him for 11 years and garnered more than 75 state, national and international awards.
Bridgehampton gained major notice in 1988, when The Wine Spectator rated its Grand Vineyard Chardonnay among the top 100 wines of the year worldwide. Mr. Olsen-Harbich was also credited with gaining Federal approval for the South Fork as a wine-growing region with an official appellation in 1985. Approval for the North Fork followed in 1986.
Activity at Bridgehampton is at a standstill. Mr. Greenfield said the site he chose in 1979 was a poor location for growing grapes. The soil is good, he added, but the low-lying area traps frost.
Experts generally agree that the South Fork is somewhat less hospitable to grapes than the North Fork because it is more humid, less sunny and has a slightly shorter growing season. But Mr. Greenfield said the effort to salvage the vineyard, despite "very serious frost damage" and endless battles to control persistent regrowth on cleared land, had cost $500,000 over the years.
Even as he was struggling to overcome his vinicultural problems, Mr. Greenfield said, the winery functioned by processing the fruit of other growers on the North and South Forks.
"This is similar to what the French do, as well as a number of wineries in California," he said. "In the past several years Bridgehampton production has been from the fruit of other growers on the North Fork entirely. Every vineyard has a sweet spot and a best day for harvesting."
Mr. Greenfield said he was convinced that by shopping at North Fork sites and buying from the best of each yield Bridgehampton could create wines that would demonstrate just how high Long Island could climb in competitions among premium wines. The series that they called the Grand Vineyard Selection brought the critical acclaim and restaurant orders.
"Even a difficult French restaurant like Le Bernardin was calling to order our Grand Vineyard Selection Chardonnay," Mr. Greenfield recounted. "And a California wine writer, Anthony Dias Blue, put it on his 10-best list for the year."
The original vineyard is gone, most of it sold to a developer who hopes that a golf course will thrive where grapes did not.
Mr. Greenfield says he can offer "equity in this label and this brand, a pre-existing interest in the marketplace for this wine." Adding luster to are the labels that Mr. Greenfield designed with his sister. A set of labels is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan.
Like Mr. Greenfield, a new owner would depend on off-site vineyards for his fruit. A recent issue of The Wine Press, an East End publication, reports that the region has 40 growers and 17 wineries, numbers that do not assure a steady supply of grapes for independent wineries or a steady market for growers without wineries, the report suggested.
 
Not Like the Napa Valley
 That market is necessarily erratic. Some wineries continue to sell part of what they grow, and others continue to buy part of what they need each year.
"A lot of it depends on the year and on how their own vineyards are doing," Alice Wyse of Cornell Cooperative Extension said. A vintner who has sold out his chardonnay from a previous vintage may decide to space for his own use the next year, Ms. Wyse said, adding:
"You have to realize that production is relatively small. It's not like the Napa Valley, where there are 200 wineries. Here there are 17."
Mr. Greenfield, who was apparently able to obtain the grapes that he needed, said the problem was more a matter of cost than availability.
"The economics of scale just aren't there," he said. "In a business that is so capital intensive there is an important leg that just has to be under the table. You can't float these businesses on a wing and a prayer."
Mr. Greenfield said he could not think of anyone in the business who would deny that the experience had been "anything less than a trying and difficult adventure." And yet, he said, they all remain committed to promoting Long Island wines, and "very few are talking about getting out of the business."
"The bottom line is that it is impossible for me to carry on alone in a business that now needs to be recapitalized," he said.
"It is a very capital-intensive undertaking," confirmed Mr. Wolffer, who has planted 40 acres with merlot and chardonnay grapes at his Sagpond Vineyards in Sagaponack. By Mr. Wolffer's calculations, it takes eight years to make an operating profit and that, he said, "would not take into consideration all the capital improvements."
"You have to have either funds or partners available to do it," he added. "Bridgehampton and Southampton Winery has shown that with debt you cannot finance a vineyard."
As president of Euro Investors Property Inc., which operates globally, Mr. Wolffer, like Dr. Damianos, appears to deeper pockets than Mr. Greenfield. Mr. Wolffer is improving his soil in Bridgehampton and said that with the help of his wine maker, Roman Roth, he can keep the South Fork in the limelight as a wine region.
"If you produce a good grape, you can certainly produce a good wine if you have good wine maker," he said.
That view was supported by Dr. Damianos, who stressed that North Fork vintners had a head start. They have had more time to learn from successes and failures, he said, suggesting that there was no reason why the South Fork should not follow the same path. "With the right grapes and the right kind of cultural practices, it is an extremely viable cultural area," he said.
Mr. Greenfield said he was talking with prospective buyers. "I hope someone will come in and take advantage of me and my mistakes and continue with the Bridgehampton winery," he said. "The toughest thing to imagine is that it just wouldn't exist after 15 years of effort and achievements."

HEADLINE: Let's All Complain About Postal Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It has been suggested that, because the nominal price of first-class postage is about where it was in the late 18th century, Americans who complain about the proposal to increase postal rates are merely whining wimps who are lacking in historical perspective. 
 However, the real price of transportation (a key input in postal service) has plummeted over the last 200 years. In 1799 it took 53 days for an Army courier to travel from Detroit to Pittsburgh.
Today the same trip can conveniently be made in minutes. Likewise, the productive efficiency of the United States is vastly greater now than it was even a few decades ago.
Given the plunge in transportation costs, joined with other technological improvements and a large increase in the scale of postal activity, the price of postage should have fallen dramatically.
Americans do not oppose postal-rate increases because of their ignorance of history.
Rather, opposition to these increases grows from the correct perception that a legally protected monopolist such as the United States Postal Service can keep prices higher, and service inferior, to what these would be under competition.
Regardless of how today's postal rates compare with rates in the past, opening the delivery of first-class mail to competition would lower rates still further while improving service.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SAYS INTEREST RATE RISE MAY SLOW GROWTH

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With long-term interest rates now above 7 percent, President Clinton's top economic advisers expressed concern over the weekend that further rate increases could damage the economy and slow growth to an unacceptable level.
The Administration argues that the economy is going through a transition from very strong growth in last year's fourth quarter to less growth now. But no one can tell where the leveling-off point will be. The concern is that if interest rates rise another notch, economic growth could decline too much -- slowing the creation of new jobs. 
 "Based on what we know, our view of how strongly the economy will grow this year is not changed by an interest rate in the neighborhood of 7 percent," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "But if the level goes much above 7 percent, then that would exercise a contractionary effect on the economy."
Long-term interest rates rose nearly three-quarters of a percentage point during the last month, reaching 7.26 percent on Friday in a bond-trading session shortened in observance of Good Friday. Not since the early 1980's have rates increased so much in a single month, and the comments by Ms. Tyson and other Administration officials seemed clearly aimed at calming the markets.
The Administration's new concerns could put it in open conflict for the first time with the Federal Reserve Board, whose chief priority has been to control inflation even at the cost of economic growth. The Administration's priority has been creation of jobs through economic expansion, even at the possible cost of an inflation rate that is mildly higher than what the Fed might accept.
While Fed officials have expressed surprise at the rapid run-up in interest rates, they have not indicated whether they agree with Ms. Tyson and other Administration officials that 7 percent is as high as rates can go without choking economic growth.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, in an interview yesterday, also expressed concern about rates rising any farther. Mr. Bentsen and, separately, Robert Rubin, the President's chief economic adviser, in a television appearance on "This Week," said they expected interest rates to fall back once the bond markets settle down.
"I think the underlying economic fundamentals will in the end have their influence," Mr. Bentsen said. When that happens, Ms. Tyson expects interest rates to come back into line with the economy's true strength.
"Based on history, the normal level today for long-term interest rates should be about a percentage point below what they are now," she said.
Their views were clearly a signal to Wall Street and its traders to end what might come to be known as the great interest rate "crash" of 1994.
What has crashed, in fact, is bond prices, particularly the price for the Treasury's 30-year bond. As they have gone down, so has the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost nearly 9 percent of its value since the end of January.
On Wall Street, when bond prices fall, that perversely makes interest rates rise. When a $1,000 bond paying $60 annually, or 6 percent in interest, falls to a price of $825, because bondholders are selling in a panic, then the rate, in effect, rises for the person acquiring a $1,000 bond for only $825.
For the new buyer, the $60 annual interest payment continues unchanged, but now it represents a 7.26 percent return on his $825 investment. And that is how much rates have jumped in recent months, with much of the rise coming in March.
The 30-year Treasury bond in particular is a benchmark for home construction loans, mortgages and car loans, the industries that made the economy boom in the fourth quarter, mainly because rates had fallen so low. Now rates are rising, largely because speculators had bought bonds with borrowed money, gambling that the weak economy that had prevailed since 1989 would keep bond prices high and interest rates low.
But those buyers changed their minds and started dumping bonds to repay debts after the Federal Reserve, for the first time in five years, raised rates on Feb. 4. The Fed acted out of concern that the unexpectedly strong economic growth in recent months might raise the inflation rate later this year. But the bond market took the Fed's action as a signal that the long boom in bond prices was over, that higher inflation was on the way back and that bondholders had better get out.
 
Braking a Swift Selloff
 Their rapid exodus gave the bond market a momentum of its own, and as bond prices fell, rates rose far more than what either the Fed or the Administration had anticipated. It is this momentum that the Administration is trying to arrest, but in doing so it raises the potential for disagreement with the Fed.
While the Administration endorsed the Fed's rate increase on Feb. 4 and another small one on March 22, the subsequent run-up in rates is forcing the administration to be more insistent that inflation is mild, indeed milder than the Fed might believe.
Still, the White House avoids criticism of the Fed or its chairman, Alan Greenspan.
"There is a feeling in the Administration that we respect the guy and he is trying to do the right thing," a senior economic adviser in the Administration said. "He may be wrong; he may be right. But he is trying to achieve the same goals we are."
The main goal is mild inflation. Ms. Tyson and Mr. Rubin say inflation is mild now and seems very likely to stay mild -- a declaration that no one at the Federal Reserve has publicly matched in recent weeks. Despite the increase in interest rates, the Council of Economic Advisers, which Ms. Tyson heads, sticks to its forecast: the annual inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, might rise to 3.5 percent in the months ahead from 3 percent today, an acceptable increase brought on by a gradually strengthening economy.
If the economy grows gradually, then the normal 30-year bond rate should be between 6 percent and 6.5 percent, Ms. Tyson said, or roughly a percentage point less than the level reached last week.
Mr. Rubin yesterday also predicted that the inflation rate was most likely to remain at a moderate 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the months ahead. That is in line with an economy that the Administration says will settle down this year and early next year to an annual growth rate of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent -- enough growth to continue to create new jobs.
 
Two Causes Suggested
 Given this projection, there are two explanations for the unexpected jump in interest rates, Ms. Tyson said. "One is that the economy is stronger than we have been predicting," she said, "and the other is that the market is going through an adjustment that has to do with loans and losses that needed to be covered in a period of time."
Ms. Tyson said that bond prices might be responding both to the speculation and to an economy that is momentarily growing more strongly than anticipated. "There is agreement in the Administration that it is both factors," she said. "But no one knows yet how much weight to ascribe to each one."
The uncertainty made the surge in employment in March, reported by the Labor Department on Friday, particularly difficult to read. The Labor Department said that while the unemployment rate remained at 6.5 percent, the same as in February, the economy had created 456,000 jobs, the biggest one-month increase in years.
Such job gains suggest stronger growth than the Administration's estimate. But Ms. Tyson and other Administration officials, among them Alicia Munnell, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for economic policy, said that the proper way to interpret March's job figures was to average the 456,000 figure with job growth in January and February -- a process that produces an average monthly gain of slightly more than 200,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: Crusading for Harmony as a Skinhead Spy;
Repentant Racist to Go Into Hiding After Giving Data on New Jersey's Neo-Nazis

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., March 31

 BODY:
Dominick Bruno Jr. says he first took a razor to his scalp when he was 15, submitting to the rites of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang that prowled the mall-encrusted landscape of suburban New Jersey. Soon he was preaching bigotry in the schoolyard and flooding increasingly diverse neighborhoods with fliers that said, "Deport Niggers, Spiks, Jews!"
But recently, something snapped in Mr. Bruno, a leader of the S.S. Action Group, one of the more virulent skinhead gangs. He said he began to feel repulsed by the subculture he had embraced: the bristling hostility to nonwhites, the throbbing racist music from Germany and Britain called oi, the violent teen-agers who seemed little more than small-town losers hungry for attention. 
 So, he said, he quit. But first, he became a spy.
He will go into hiding soon, he said, having given anti-racist groups reams of information about neo-Nazis that seem to provide a rare glimpse into the workings of a shadowy movement whose growth has alarmed the authorities in both the United States and abroad. When he surfaces, he will still be a zealot, he said, only this time he will crusade for racial harmony.
 
Fancies of Being Master Propagandist
 "I don't have it in me anymore," Mr. Bruno, now 18, said in an interview at the apartment he shares with his father. He recalled how he once fancied himself a master propagandist, spending hours a day at a computer in his swastika-adorned bedroom, chain-smoking as he wrote to racists around the world and fashioned incendiary pamphlets, fliers and letters to the editor.
"It was just seeming more and more stupid to me," he said. "My beliefs slowly drifted further and further away, until I reached a point where it was the exact opposite."
He said there was no one incident that inspired the turnaround, though he was impressed by anti-bias literature from the New Jersey Freedom Organization, a nonpartisan advocacy group that lobbies for opportunities for young people. When he resolved to resign, he called Cliff Smith, the group's 24-year-old president, seeking help, Mr. Smith said. Mr. Bruno says that the people of New Jersey may be skeptical of his conversion, perhaps remembering the many times he marched down their streets in military fatigues, taunting passers-by with the straight-armed fascist salute and calling for a white homeland in North America.
And even if everything he says is true, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Bruno, a high-school dropout with a short, slight frame, will return to bigotry in the future. For now, the anti-racist groups that he has assisted are cautious. But they say that so far, Mr. Bruno is credible.
"I would accept him as legitimate," said Irwin Suall, an expert on neo-Nazis at the Anti-Defamation League in New York, adding, "A number of things that he spoke of correspond with information that we know to be accurate."
Mr. Suall said the intelligence that Mr. Bruno was turning over to the league was "quite valuable," particularly details on how American neo-Nazis exchange information, music and aid with those in Germany, Britain and other countries.
 
Worried About Safety
 But Mr. Suall also said he was worried about Mr. Bruno's safety. "The skinheads are so impulsive and mindless in their behavior, so violence-oriented, that they are not going to weigh the pros and cons of going after him," Mr. Suall said. "They are simply going to try and seek revenge quickly."
The Anti-Defamation League says that there are as many as 30 skinhead gangs in New Jersey with about 400 members, but that because they are made up of teen-agers and people in their early 20's, the groups tend to be loosely organized. Mr. Bruno said he thought the number of members was closer to 250, though he said he regularly heard of gangs' springing up.
The gangs use names like Eastern Hammerskins, White Rights Union, Aryan Glory Skins, Doc Marten Skins and the Skinhead Assault Crew. The total for New Jersey is among the highest in the country, but officials in Trenton say it is unfair to compare New Jersey with other states because it is one of the few with systems to report bias crimes.
 
Recent New Jersey Violence
 In recent years, there have been a number of violent incidents in New Jersey involving neo-Nazis, including one in Keansburg in 1992 in which 12 skinheads were arrested on attempted murder and other charges. They were accused of attacking an acquaintance because he had a Hispanic friend.
Several were tried and convicted, the police said.
"The younger neo-Nazis are increasingly turning to acts of violence and vandalism," Mr. Bruno wrote in an 11-page report for the Anti-Defamation League that included the names, addresses and phone numbers of scores of neo-Nazis and other racists in New Jersey and elsewhere.
Through he considered himself a "full-time racial activist," Mr. Bruno said he was never arrested for violence, which he said he had disavowed except when provoked. But he was expelled from several schools for disciplinary problems. And the police said they had been monitoring him closely for months. He said he had not told officials that he was quitting, but he said he hoped to work with them on anti-bias campaigns.
The skinhead activity in New Jersey may be fueled by a recession that has wiped out many blue-collar jobs, stoking the resentment of working-class whites, and by the changing makeup of the suburbs in the nation's most densely populated state.
 
'Trying to Keep Them Out'
 "The minorities are starting to come out of the cities and they are coming into our towns, selling their drugs here, doing their robberies here, and we're trying to keep them out," said Douglas Moditz, 19, who started the S.S. Action Group four years ago in New Jersey. Mr. Moditz, once a close friend of Mr. Bruno, apparently did not know that Mr. Bruno has betrayed the group.
Though the S.S. Action Group has not been linked to serious violence, its two or three dozen members in the state have created an uproar by distributing tens of thousands of racist fliers and holding marches in Edison, Carteret, Woodbridge, Rahway, Linden and other central New Jersey communities.
"We've received a lot of complaints," said Robert W. Gluck, the Middlesex County Prosecutor. "People were obviously very offended."
The authorities in Winfield in Union County arrested Mr. Bruno, Mr. Moditz and two other gang members in early February on disorderly conduct charges. The case is about to be dismissed on First Amendment grounds.
 
Helping the Arch-Enemy
 Mr. Bruno began discussing his life as a neo-Nazi skinhead after he was contacted by a reporter about his arrest. After three interviews, he revealed that he was dropping out and helping the Anti-Defamation League, which many racist groups consider a kind of arch-enemy.
He said he became a skinhead for some of the same reasons other teen-agers enter gangs, from the Bloods and the Crips to the Latin Kings: camaraderie and an outlet for anger.
"In some ways it's another form of teen-age rebellion," he said. "It's starts off that way. But then you start getting the literature and you start getting more into it and then it's not rebellion anymore; you're in the movement. That's what happened to me."
He said the Ku Klux Klan, the Christian Posse Comitatus, the New Order and other long-established racist groups exert influence over skinhead gangs but generally do not control them. The S.S. Action Group obtained much of its literature by tapping into a network of white-power groups, including one based in West Virginia, he said. The groups are also eager to give legal and organizational advice.
 
100,000 Printed Pieces
 The S.S. Action Group traveled to marches and paid for printing from donations sent to its post office box in Colonia, which is stamped on its fliers. Mr. Bruno said the gang handed out more than 100,000 pieces of literature in 1993, a figure that officials do not dispute. People often joined after reading the literature.
Mr. Bruno said he was hoping to patch up relations with family members and others who had rejected him when he became a skinhead. He is also trying to figure out what to do about a $20 tattoo on his lower arm: a swastika coiled around a cross.
"I've been too happy since I got rid of the movement," he said. "That's another reason I want to speak out to kids. You lose so much. It's almost impossible to get a job. You lose all your friends. I kind of like to look at this as being cool timing because it's around Easter, which is about rebirth. I have a new outlook, a new life, a new way of living."

HEADLINE: Development Overtakes Island's Black Culture

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DAUFUSKIE ISLAND, S.C., April 4

 BODY:
In the quiet glens and sandy lanes of Daufuskie Island, the descendants of slaves consider nearby Hilton Head, with its expensive cars, condominiums and manicured golf courses, as almost another world.
But development is crossing Calibogue Sound, and longtime residents of this isolated island worry that growth and higher taxes may drive them from their homes. 
 "We're becoming an endangered species," said Yvonne Wilson, whose ancestors were slaves. One or two black families typically leave the island each year, and people like Mrs. Wilson hope that incentives can be found to encourage others to stay.
The island, with a history rooted in sea island cotton, timber and Union occupation during the Civil War, was a thriving fishing community of almost 1,000 people about 40 years ago, before pollution from the Savannah River destroyed the oyster beds.
 
An Ebb of Jobs and People
 Jobs and residents drifted away, and the unique culture and language of Daufuskie and other islands along the Southeast seacoast began to ebb. The dominant tongue on the islands used to be a mix of African and English dialects called Gullah, but the last census showed that only about 180 people in South Carolina spoke it at home.
Daufuskie's population had dwindled to about 60 when developers began buying large tracts on the 12-square-mile island in 1984. Now antebellum-style houses and developments line the shore, and 150 people, one-third of them black, call the island home. Several thousand people are expected to be living here within a decade, which worries some of the old-time islanders.
"When I was coming up, we were all as one," Mrs. Wilson said. "We all had clothes. They may not have been new, but we were all together. Now you look around and see $100,000 houses."
Those who stayed did so out of a deep-rooted love for the island, which can be reached only by boat. They work here or commute by boat to jobs elsewhere. Students in middle and high school have a 45-minute boat ride to Hilton Head for classes.
 
A Positive Perspective
 Twice a month, the Rev. Marion C. Taylor takes a ferry across Calibogue Sound to preach at the island's 126-year-old Union Baptist Church, with its wood stove, cross of tree limbs and simple white, wooden pillars.
"There are those of the feeling they are slowly being pushed off the island," the 68-year-old minister said. "But I'm of the feeling development has helped" by bringing jobs and opportunities. Private developments provide work for about 25 residents.
Developers say they are trying to do their part to help the old-time islanders. Jim Hardy, the manager of the Haig Point Plantation development, which is owned by International Paper, says his company has built an emergency clinic, made loans to small businesses and provided free golf lessons to students.
The company has also spent nearly $200,000 on various island projects and intends to bid on the school ferry contract, with the goal of expanding service to make it more convenient.
 
'Conrack' School Operating
 Children still attend the two-room elementary school where the writer Pat Conroy taught in the 1960's and on which he based his novel "The Water Is Wide," which in turn inspired the 1974 movie "Conrack." A larger school is planned, as is a center to provide government services to an island that until 20 years ago did not even have a telephone.
Ervin Simmons, a county social service worker who lives on Daufuskie and works on the mainland, says that islanders worry too much about the developers and not enough about building their own futures.
"I don't want to see us spending too much time pointing at those who would not do for us, and develop self-reliance," he said.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People plans to work with banks, investors and islanders to develop a conference center and a small inn near the Baptist church, which has long been the island's focal point of spiritual and cultural life.
The group's Southeastern regional field director, Nelson Rivers III, said that "we're going to make sure Daufuskie Island doesn't turn into Hilton Head," where longtime islanders were often pushed aside by development. "We're going to make sure when the goodness comes, it is shared by everybody," he said.

HOSPITAL PARTNERS, BIG AND SMALL
Economic pressures in the health care industry are causing big-name medical centers in the New York area to pursue affiliations with small hospitals. The result is the emergence of a few huge hospital networks and a constantly shifting landscape of hospital alliances that make Balkan politics seem simple. Such consolidation is taking place all over the country, but is most striking in New York, where hospitals until recently have turned a blind eye to the inevitable arrival of managed care. A1. 

NEW YORK CITY
 
DRUG PROGRAM: SOFT OR SENSIBLE?
At a time when the Federal Government and many state legislatures are considering measures to keep repeat offenders in prison longer, a Brooklyn drug-treatment program represents a small but firm tug in the opposite direction: toward keeping them out of prison altogether. Proponents say the program keeps scarce prison cells available for the most violent criminals, saves money and, by reducing addictions, cuts crime in the long run. B3.
 
FIRE GUTS BROOKLYN TENEMENTS
A four-alarm fire roared through a row of four tenement buildings in a Brooklyn waterfront community on the East River. No one was killed, but 21 people were injured, some as they were rescued from fiery rooms, and 25 families were left homeless by the blaze, which gutted the three-story attached frame buildings on Huron Street in Greenpoint. B3.
 
GANG ARRESTS REPORTED
A leader and a person described as the senior executioner of one of New York's most violent drug gangs, the Wild Cowboys -- which controlled the cocaine trade in parts of Washington Heights and the South Bronx -- were captured in the Dominican Republic, the police said. With the arrests, investigators said, all 41 gang members named in two indictments of the Wild Cowboys last year are now in custody. Charged with a host of crimes, including 10 murders and multiple assaults, drug sales, conspiracy and witness tampering, all face maximum sentences of 25 years to life if convicted of the most serious charges. B7.
 
HELPING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS
With $300,000 from the German Government, social workers are going to Brooklyn groceries and butcher shops, synagogues and bus stations in search of aging survivors of Nazi persecution who need help. Finding them will not be simple. Many have deteriorating physical or emotional health and live alone. But Selfhelp Community Services has long experience and knows where to look. Selfhelp estimates that there are more than 6,000 Holocaust survivors living in Brooklyn, mainly in the neighborhoods of Brighton Beach, Sheepshead Bay, Borough Park, Canarsie and Kensington. B7.
 
REGION
 
A CRISIS ON THE BENCH
One in eight Federal judgeships are empty nationwide, forcing many active judges to double their caseloads. Some senior judges are taking on as many cases at age 80 as they did at 45 to help their younger colleagues. And criminal cases have all but pushed civil cases off the docket. In the New York area, the problem has been particularly acute. But who exactly is to blame for the long-running vacancies is a matter of debate. B6.
 
TROUBLING QUESTIONS ON CHURCH DEAL
The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America is trying to extricate itself from legal claims and troubling questions surrounding a multimillion-dollar real estate transaction in Westchester County. Leaders of the church, the largest body of Orthodox Christians in the United States, hope a proposed $7 million settlement can put to rest questions about the deal raised by some church members. Meanwhile, the New York State Attorney General has gone to court seeking access to financial records surrounding the transaction. B6.
 
MANY WAYS OF REJOICING
The faithful celebrated the Resurrection atop the Empire State Building and beside a hot-dog vendor on Fifth Avenue. They prayed in Korean and Polish, knelt at St. John the Divine in Manhattan and sang loud at New Hope Baptist Church in Queens. Some took part in a Latin Mass at Ave Maria Chapel in Westbury, L.I., while others acted out the betrayal of Christ by Judas in street plays in midtown Manhattan. B6.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW;
Few Places to Run as Fund Prices Drop

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Mutual fund investors found almost nowhere to hide last quarter, as they suffered through some of the worst stock and bond markets in several years. Funds usually called "conservative" -- municipal bond, utility and equity income funds -- suffered some of the worst damage.
The losses are a sharp reversal from the strong gains all kinds of funds achieved last year. Standing in sharpest contrast were the declines in international funds, the stars of the fourth quarter of 1993. 
 General stock funds, which according to industry figures hold more than $650 billion of investors' money, fell 3.4 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Morningstar Inc., the fund-tracking firm in Chicago. That decline is the steepest since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sending American stock markets into free fall. Last quarter, not a single category of diversified stock funds posted a gain, and just a few individual funds managed that.
Still, individual investors seem to be staying the course -- so far. While net flows of money into domestic stock funds have slowed sharply this year, they remain positive, according to figures supplied by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. Even at the large no-load fund companies, whose investors include the most trigger-happy, stock funds attracted an average $777 million for the last four weeks, down from $1.3 billion for the first four weeks of the year. But spokesmen for some of the funds that are sold directly to investors, like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price, reported net redemptions last week in some funds -- a sign that investors' relative calm so far may not last.
Bond investors have already been bailing out, and the retreat has spread to municipal bonds. Tax-exempt bond funds, which at the end of January attracted average new money of more than $700 million a month, subsequently started experiencing strong outflows. By the end of March, investors were yanking an average $300 million a week, AMG indicates.
That is not surprising, given that municipal bond funds fell 5.3 percent last quarter, the biggest decline in more than a decade. Indeed, investors would have to go back to 1981 to find such a poor quarter; even in the spring of 1987, often cited as the municipal market's worst moment, funds fell 4.9 percent.
Most municipal-fund investors have never experienced such results; back in 1981, when these funds plunged more than 9 percent in one quarter, they had less than $3 billion in tax-exempt funds. Today, these funds have more than $250 billion, more than half of which has poured in since the end of 1991, as banks in particular started selling these funds to clients dissatisfied with the returns they could get on bank deposits.
But redemptions, and fund managers' fears of more of that, are pushing prices down in the tax-exempt market, as some funds put the "for sale" sign on hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds. "The municipal market is dominated by individuals in bond funds, and when they are redeeming, historically the market has reacted badly," said Jerome J. Jacobs, who manages tax-exempt funds for the Vanguard Group. "This is a case in point."
Today and tomorrow will be critical days for the municipal market, Mr. Jacobs said, because investors will have had the weekend to digest just how bad their losses have been of late. Yet, tax-exempt bonds now yield almost as much as taxable Treasury issues, a very rare occurrence. Money mangers like Mr. Jacobs are hoping bond fund investors' desire for return will help overcome their fear.
Americans have also been fleeing taxable bond funds, where the carnage has been concentrated in those that invest in government debt. Funds that specialize in Ginnie Maes, mortgage-backed securities sold by the Government National Mortgage Association, have suffered redemptions so severe that in February, they sold a net $2.8 billion of bonds, according to the Investment Company Institute. The exodus by investors accelerated in March.
Taxable bond funds lost about 2.5 percent in value last quarter, as steep price declines overwhelmed the interest payments generated by the funds' bond holdings. Those price declines could worsen this week, as the market reacts to a report on Friday that companies created new jobs at a far faster rate than expected in February. Many bond traders were on vacation when the data came out, but those who were on duty sent the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond up to 7.26 percent, the highest since January 1993.
The job figures may fuel fears that the economy is heating up beyond the Government's control, which would eventually spur inflation. But money managers note that much of the data they use to get a grip on the state of the economy has been disrupted by bad weather and earthquakes, and that on a fundamental basis, inflation still seems far off.
"What you're seeing now is a very strong divergence between fundamental bond pricing and technical pricing," said David Rosenberg, who runs the Oppenheimer Government Securities Fund, the quarter's top government mortgage fund. "What's unnerved the bond market is a reversal of the technical factors" that drove up bond prices in the fall.
Those included demand for Treasury securities from state and local governments, banks and hedge funds, which borrowed heavily to buy bonds. All three groups, in different ways, were taking advantage of the low interest rates available and the huge difference between short-term and long-term rates. When the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates on Feb. 4, that demand dried up. Indeed, hedge funds had to sell bonds to repay their loans, driving down prices.
Traders will continue "to hit bids, to sell bonds, until the technicals turn around," Mr. Rosenberg said. "This wave of selling is hard to ignore, but I don't think this will be a bad place to be invested three months from now."
Technical factors were also at work in one of the quarter's few bright spots: Japan. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks climbed almost 11 percent last quarter; because of the drop in the dollar's exchange value with the yen, American investors could have made far more. Indeed, the quarter's top fund, DFA Japanese Small Company, a quasi-index fund that is always fully invested, soared 28.4 percent.
While some of these gains may have been related to hopes for an economic recovery in Japan, a large part of them came from frantic buying by foreigners, especially those fleeing other Pacific Rim markets. As a group, all Pacific region funds suffered the worst bloodletting, falling 8 percent.
Looking ahead, "the foreign investors' asset shift, at least the first wave, seems to be over," said Seung K. Kwak, portfolio manager of Scudder, Stevens & Clark's Japan Fund. "They'll need more evidence of a solid earnings recovery, and the yen's strength abating, before another wave comes."
Here at home, the happiest investors may be those in the Merrill Lynch Technology Fund, which is managed by James K. Renck. Calling from California last week, Mr. Renck explained that he had 40 percent of his portfolio in cash last quarter, and the rest of the $395 million fund in about 15 stocks, on which he does extensive research. This approach is unconventional -- most technology funds hold dozens of stocks and far less cash -- but it paid off last quarter with a return just shy of 15 percent.
Despite the recent blood bath in technology stocks, some of which saw double-digit losses last month, Mr. Renck remains moderately upbeat. "Particularly in the semiconductor industry, which is generally a good indicator for technology, a lot of companies will be saying positive things" about their sales and earnings, he said. "I just hope it has a positive impact on the stock market."

Chart: "Smaller Stocks, Smaller Losses"
 Small was beautiful in equity investing in the first quarter of 1994, as funds that invest in the stocks of smaller companies held up best in the overall market decline. But only a relative handful - 24 out of 155 - managed to stay in the black, according to data form Morningstar.
 Teh average loss for this kind of fund was about 3 percent, but a few losst far more. The key to success was avoiding stocks that were trading at high multiples of their 1993 earnings, the so-called hot growth stocks. Value funds, those that look for cheap stocks (particularly fast growers with low prices), fared well, and keeping lots of cash on hand didn't hurt. Here are the best and worst performers for the quarter.
 
BEST PERFORMERS
 
Rank, name of fund: G.T. America Growth A
1st qtr. return: +5.1%
Remarks: Despite its name, this $127 millionfund is more value oriented and held a big cache of cash last quarter.
 
Rank, name of fund: Robertson Stephens Value Plus
1st qtr. return: +3.8
Remarks: "Growth at a good price" is the watchword at thie no-load fund, which, despite a strong 1993, remains farily small at $34 million in assets.
 
Rank, name of fund: Heartland Value
1st qtr. return: +3.3 If this $227 million fund continues to grow this fast, it may be hard-pressed to maintain its focus on tiny stocks far off the beaten track.
 
Rank, name of fund: Mutual Discovery
1st qtr. return: +3.1
Remarks: Michael Price's year-old fund already has $696 million in assets, more than a quarter of them overseas. Closed to new investors.
 
WORST PERFORMERS
 
Rank, name of fund: Keystone Hartwell Emerging Growth A
1st qtr. return: -9.8%
Remarks: Expecting John Hartwell to eschew high-multiple stocks would be like expecting an old dog to learn to tapdance.
 
Rank, name of fund: Alger Small Capitalization
1st qtr. return: -9.6
Remarks: Another old-line hot-growth fund, with an average price-earnings multiple of 33, compared with 25 for the average small-cap fund.
 
Rank, name of fund: Smith Barney Shearson Special Eq. B
1st qtr. return: -8.1
Remarks: Investing in larger-than-average stocks didn't help what was one of 1993's hottest funds; neither do high fees and redemption charges.
 
Rank, name of fund: Oppenheimer Discovery
1st qtr. return: -7.9
Remarks: Once named the OTC Fund, it still finds its high-octane stocks mostly on the over-the counter (Nasdaq) market.

Peacemaker or Pet-Food Maker? History Will Say

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, April 3

 BODY:
When historians evaluate this period in Ireland, supporters of Prime Minister Albert Reynolds hope that he will be praised as the leader who brought peace to this island after 700 years of intermittent war.
But if he fails in his effort to end the current phase of that war -- the 25 years of killing in the British province of Northern Ireland -- he could be relegated to a footnote: a pet-food manufacturer and dance hall impresario who was known to dress in a cowboy suit and sing a Jim Reeves country-western howler that begins, "Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone." 
 Mr. Reynolds, 61, said in a recent interview that he was no more ashamed of his cowboy stint than Bill Clinton was of playing the saxophone.
He smiled and shook his head tolerantly -- and acknowledged the similarity to another American President, Harry Truman -- when reminded that his detractors had said that the job of running this country of 3.5 million people would be too much for him and that he did not have the experience needed to broker a peace between Britain and the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
"There were those who said he doesn't know about Northern Ireland, he doesn't have a grasp of it," Mr. Reynolds said. "Those were proved wrong."
Although peace is still far from assured, the efforts of Mr. Reynolds and Prime Minister John Major of Britain to end the violence and start new peace talks are still alive.
Mr. Reynolds is widely credited with having helped nudge the Irish Republican Army toward a more moderate course, which resulted in its announcement Wednesday that it would observe a 72-hour cease-fire in Northern Ireland this week.
At a ceremony in Belfast today celebrating the 78th anniversary of the Easter Rising, Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A. political wing, said in a clearly conciliatory tone that the cease-fire could lead to peace if Mr. Major used it to talk to Sinn Fein.
While dealing with the peace effort, Mr. Reynolds is also struggling with a troubled economy and one of the highest unemployment rates in the European Union, about 19 percent. But he defends his Government.
"This is the most stable Government Ireland has had for years," he said, referring to the coalition partnership between his Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny) party and the Labor Party. Together, they have a margin of 37 votes in the 166-seat lower house of Parliament, the largest in Ireland's 72 years of independence.
Mr. Reynolds, who had been Finance Minister, became Prime Minister in February 1992 after a struggle in which the popular Charles J. Haughey was pushed out of the party leadership. He was immediately hit with an international scandal. A pregnant 14-year-old who contended that she had been raped by the father of a friend wanted to have an abortion in Britain, since abortion is outlawed in Ireland.
In this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, Mr. Reynolds was caught between groups demanding further liberalization and those opposed to abortion as murder. He is a practicing Catholic and had never been known as a liberal, and his advisers told him to leave the issue to the courts. But he put the abortion question to a referendum in June 1992, and it established the right of women to abortion information and to travel abroad for abortions.
On the same day, Irish voters approved the Treaty on European Unity, giving it a fillip just when it seemed to be in trouble elsewhere in Europe.
At the end of the year, he called for a general election in which his party did poorly, and his career at the top seemed finished. But he turned the defeat into victory, bargaining with the Labor Party to keep the Prime Minister's job for himself and powerful Cabinet posts for his party.
Last April, he began the new peace initiative by carrying secret proposals to Mr. Major from Mr. Adams and John Hume, the most influential moderate Catholic leader in the North. The proposals came to him through Mr. Hume, a friend of his. Since then he has been a negotiator between Sinn Fein and London, and both sides have praised him.
"I believe in making a decision and going for it," he said. "You can leave the status quo or take a risk, try to change things that will leave an impression after you're gone."
A native of the Irish midlands, he went to a college in County Sligo, then into the pet-food business, which is still being operated by one of his seven children. He ran for Parliament and worked his way up within the system.
As he has in his political life, he has made changes in his personal life. A chain-smoker, he quit. He gave up his soda pop habit when he learned he was a diabetic and now consumes dozens of cups of tea daily and swims whenever he can. And while he can no longer be persuaded to sing in public, he will on request recite a poem.
He has promised to take on the issue of divorce with a referendum next fall, another issue so sticky that his critics say it will divide the country and result in his defeat. He has made it clear to the country's powerful bishops that he will not bow to their pressure in all matters. Since he has been Prime Minister, the Parliament has liberalized laws on the distribution of condoms and has decriminalized homosexuality.
"He has done extremely well," said Tim Pat Coogan, a historian and author of a standard work on the I.R.A. who had criticized Mr. Reynolds for not being knowledgeable enough about the North.
"In a way, it's like Nixon and China," Mr. Coogan continued, referring to the peace effort. "He may be the only one people and politicians can trust to get the job done."

Proposals like Mr. Clinton's, which would require employers to buy health insurance for all their workers, have reignited a long-running battle over how to define just who is an employee. 
 The proposals raise the stakes in the debate and highlight the difficulty that Government has in trying to impose uniform regulations on a complex, dynamic workplace.
Under the Clinton plan and several other Democratic proposals, businesses would have to pay at least two-thirds of the health insurance premiums for their employees. But they would pay none of the premiums for independent contractors. The proposed requirement, known as an employer mandate, would apply only to employees, not to independent contractors providing similar services.
 
Subsidies for Contractors
 Such contractors would have to pay their own health insurance premiums. Under the Clinton plan, they could, in many cases, get Federal subsidies, which could significantly reduce the premiums that independent contractors must pay. Independent contractors would also be able to deduct the full cost of their premiums from their taxes; the limit now is 25 percent.
Administration officials and labor lawyers say the employer mandate will create huge financial incentives to convert employees to independent contractors. To combat abuse, President Clinton would give the Treasury Department new power to issue rules classifying workers as either employees or contractors, for the purpose of calculating both health insurance premiums and taxes. Congress, heeding the pleas of small businesses, has explicitly prohibited the Treasury from issuing such rules since 1978.
But Leslie B. Samuels, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for tax policy, said the Treasury needed the new authority because employers who misclassified their employees as independent contractors "might be able to avoid their obligation to pay premiums."
The number of independent contractors has grown rapidly in recent years. Businesses like the concept because of the flexibility of paying people for specific tasks without longterm commitments, and because they do not have to provide costly benefits.
 
Independence and Initiative
 Independent contractors portray themselves as freelance entrepreneurs who prosper by using their own creativity and energy, unfettered by the strictures of the traditional employer-employee relationship. This energy, they say, fuels the nation's economic growth.
They do not want the Treasury to have the power to reclassify them as employees. Employers typically have the right to control their employees, and independent contractors do not want to be controlled.
For example, Kenneth D. Simonson, chief economist at the American Trucking Associations, said: "Independent contractors work for years with the same trucking company. But they own the equipment, have significant risk of loss and profit, can turn down loads and can choose their own routes and stopping places."
The definition of an employee has bedeviled the Internal Revenue Service and tax accountants for decades. "This is almost a religious issue," Mr. Samuels said in an interview. "People feel that strongly about it."
In scores of audits over the last decade, the Internal Revenue Service has asserted that people identifying themselves as independent contractors are actually employees. The audits provoked a political outcry because in many cases the tax agency tried to collect large amounts of back taxes.
Businesses that thought they were using independent contractors say they were nearly bankrupted when the Government classified the workers as employees and demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars of back taxes.
Mr. Samuels said: "Our proposal is only prospective. We are not trying to collect money for the past. We are trying to make sure everybody knows their responsibility for the future."
Edward N. Delaney, a Washington lawyer who represents companies that use independent contractors, said the I.R.S. had shown "a longstanding institutional bias against independent-contractor status."
Employees' income and payroll taxes are withheld from their pay by employers. There is no such withholding for independent contractors, who are supposed to make quarterly payments of their estimated taxes.
Leroy A. Strubberg, a spokesman for the National Society of Public Accountants, whose members serve many small businesses, said: "The I.R.S. has consistently fought to limit the use of independent-contractor status, and for a very good reason. Workers who have income tax withheld from their pay are far more likely to comply with their overall tax obligations." But he said that if the Treasury "drafts regulations as the President's plan would empower it to do you risk seeing the independent-contractor status decimated by bureaucrats whose primary goal is tax compliance."
Long-distance moving companies often prefer to use independent contractors. Michael L. Smith, chairman of Mayflower Transit, one of the nation's largest van lines, said, "The Administration's proposal would overturn an area of law that is reasonably well settled" and would let the Treasury rewrite the definition of employees. Mr. Samuels insisted that the Administration did not contemplate wholesale changes.
Under the Clinton plan, self-employed people would pay premiums to a regional health alliance, just as they must pay taxes to the I.R.S. Such payments are much easier to collect when they come in a bundle from one employer, rather than as separate checks from hundreds of independent contractors.

HEADLINE: She's Young and Smart, But Not Too Smart to Lead

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, April 3

 BODY:
At the age of 33, Lisa Henson is the youngest studio head in Hollywood, one of a handful of powerful women here and, most significant, a new breed of movie executive.
"Highbrow?" she said with a nervous laugh. "Does anyone really think of me as highbrow?" 
 Well, yes.
Ms. Henson, the recently appointed president of Columbia Pictures, is indeed a far cry from the old-time Hollywood moguls, and even the current crop, for that matter. The old-timers were men without elite educations, often from the streets of New York, whose visions and fantasies, for better or worse, shaped audience perceptions about a nation in the grip of economic turmoil, war and social change.
 
For the Masses
 Ms. Henson is the only studio chief to have majored in ancient Greek and folklore mythology at Harvard. She was also the first female president of The Harvard Lampoon. Yet she insists that there is absolutely no disparity between her privileged background and making movies for mass audiences. At the same time, she says it is unfair to characterize her -- and the plethora of Ivy League executives and producers rolling into Hollywood -- as being either out of touch with audiences or patronizing them.
"I worked on the 'Lethal Weapon' series at Warner Brothers and found those movies fun, very well-written," she said, sitting in her sparely furnished office at the Sony Studios in Culver City, near west Los Angeles. "I'm a genuinely enthusiastic moviegoer. And I am very forgiving toward movies, not only because I know how hard they are to make but because I have a strong and wide appetite for them."
Friendly, unpretentious, quick-witted and both guarded about herself and surprisingly blunt, Ms. Henson makes it plain that she abhors interviews and has not given one until now. Part of the reason is that interviewers focus, inevitably, on the fact that she is the eldest child of Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, who died of a streptococcal infection in 1990. But the major reason is that the process of talking about herself does not come easily. (In contrast, many movie executives and producers are almost embarrassingly candid.)
 
'I Cried Myself to Sleep'
 "When I was elected president of The Harvard Lampoon, I was so myopic and involved in my own life that I didn't understand when people from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and the news shows began calling me because I was the first woman," she said, sipping tea. "I actually said -- and I was trying to be funny -- that I slept my way to the job. I had no idea that you don't make jokes. I was horrified. Whatever I said was printed. I did everything wrong. I said everything wrong. It was a formative experience. I cried myself to sleep many nights. I was not smart at all."
No one in Hollywood would accuse Ms. Henson of not being smart. If there is any resentment of her -- and there is -- it is that her lineage, her Harvard background and her cool, assured style make her almost exotic here and account for her rapid rise. Beyond this, some producers say she can be dismissive, chilly and not especially sensitive, flaws she shares with many studio executives. Naturally, Ms. Henson bristles at such comments.
On one level, she credits her success to two people: Lucy Fisher, the executive vice president for worldwide theatrical production at Warner Brothers, and Mark Canton, a former Warner Brothers executive and now the chairman of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Companies. Even before her graduation from Harvard in 1983, she got a job working as the executive assistant to Ms. Fisher, who had graduated from Harvard a decade before, and Mr. Canton.
"It was rigorous training with Lucy," Ms. Henson said. "She's a perfectionist, the most thorough person with a script that I've ever met. She's also a very strong executive with a low-keyed persona."
 
Influence of Parents
 Her father and her mother, Jane Henson, played dominant roles in her life.
"He was extremely inclusive creatively," Ms. Henson said of her father. "There were five kids and, as each kid grew up, he included all of us in what he was doing at the time. I went to pitch meetings that he had at studios, marketing meetings. He just sat me in the corner and said, 'Be quiet and listen.' I thought all parents behaved that way."
Asked about her father's influence, Ms. Henson said: "I think about the way he did business. There was actual good will toward people. He created a positive atmosphere where creativity and good things can happen." About her mother, who lives in New York (her parents were separated at the time of Mr. Henson's death), she said: "My mother is strong-willed. People know my father as a gentle type. My mother is perhaps stronger. All the children have these two threads." (The other four children are involved in Jim Henson Productions or are attending college.)
Her father's death seems to have sobered her. "I don't feel as flippant about my life as before," she said. "I'm also a little more fearless."
 
'I Needed Some Quiet Time'
 At Warner Brothers, Ms. Henson quickly rose through the executive ranks in the late 1980's and early 90's and was involved in such films as "Lethal Weapon," "Batman," "The Last Boy Scout," "New Jack City," "Free Willy" and "Fearless."
For reasons that are still not entirely clear, she decided against renewing her contract at Warners as an executive vice president in 1992. She spent several months in the Himalayas, and went trekking, mostly with her sister Heather, in Bhutan and Tibet. Later she spent several months in London, then returned to Los Angeles to redecorate her home in the Benedict Canyon area in Beverly Hills.
"I needed some quiet time," she said.
Her appointment last August by Mr. Canton as president of production at Columbia came during an especially bleak moment at the studio. At the time, and in the months that followed, the studio, which is owned by Sony, was consumed by rumors of executive involvement with Heidi Fleiss, who was accused of running a call-girl sevice. Even more problematic, the studio has released a series of big-budget flops, notably "I'll Do Anything" and "Geronimo."
 
A Search for Scripts
 At the moment, some agents and producers say, the studio remains in the doldrums and seems not quite as aggressive in pursuing new scripts as some of its rivals. Ms. Henson, who was appointed studio president several weeks ago, insisted that she and Columbia are engaged in a search for eclectic movies. Her responsibilities, however, are more limited than those of rival studio presidents as she doesn't have the full authority to green-light movies.
"I put a slight premium on something that seems unique, a movie that distinguishes itself from other movies," she said.
Films that have involved her, and are either in production or the planning stages, include a dark untitled comedy about an aspiring television news anchor, written by Buck Henry, starring Nicole Kidman and directed by Gus Van Sant; a drama, "Higher Learning," about campus multiculturalism, written and directed by John Singleton; "Little Women," with Winona Ryder; "First Knight," based on the King Arthur legend, directed by Jerry Zucker, and probably starring Sean Connery and Richard Gere, and "Blankman," a Damon Wayans comedy.
 
A Longtime Goal
 Ms. Henson says she wanted to be a movie producer even while still at Harvard, and she remains close to many of her college friends working in the movies and television. She is unmarried, and keeps a low profile here; she is rarely seen in Hollywood hangouts.
There is no contradiction, she said, between studying ancient Greek and mythology at Harvard and serving as a production executive on such films as "Lethal Weapon" or "Pee-wee's Big Adventure."
"I never felt that what I was studying was irrelevant," she said. "I was studying the most accessible thing in the world: storytelling. There were universal common threads that run through all these stories. They had resonance, they came from nowhere and everywhere at once. These stories were eternal."
But what about "Lethal Weapon"? She laughed. "I love those kinds of movies," she said.

Office Space

 BODY:
Spurred by a strengthening economy and low interest rates, New York City's commercial real estate market is beginning to come out of its long recession, real estate brokers say. Vacant office space in Midtown is diminishing for the first time in a decade and the value of concession packages offered by landlords is starting to drop. New York City and Washington D.C. are the only markets in the country where landlord effective rents -- the tenant's rent less operating expenses, real estate taxes and electricity costs -- are on the rise.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Quarterly Review;
Losses for Investors in All Categories

 BODY:
The first quarter proved to be the worst stretch ina long time for the millions of Americans investing in mutual funds. Stocks and bonds, at homej and overseas, all dropped in value. Investors in equities appear to be taking the plunge in stride, with redemptions modest so far. Bond funds, however, are shrinking as investors pull money out. After a long rallyin the 1980's, bond investors might not have realized how far their holdings could fall on an interest rate increase of one percentage point.
 Jeffrey N. Vinik saw the Magellan fund he maanges fall from a 3 percent gain for 1994 jto a 1.59 percent loss last week. Page D9. 
 Domestic stock frunds turned sour, but tax-exempt municipal bond funds lost even more. Most municipal investors have never seen such a debacle. Back in 1981, when these funds plunged 9 percent in one quarte,r they had less than $3 billion. Today, they have $250 billion. Page D9.
 Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor, saw his hypothetical retirement portfolio lose nearly 5 percent. Page D15.

HEADLINE: Tragedy in Turkey

 BODY:
Hardly anybody is paying attention, but a bad war in Turkey has turned worse. Frustrated by a persistent Kurdish uprising in the mountainous southeast, the Turkish Army is preparing a massive spring offensive involving 130,000 troops.
America is necessarily involved. Turkey is a NATO ally and buys American weapons that were certainly not meant for use against Kurdish villages. Yet Washington's protests are muted for an ironic reason: The U.S. relies on bases in Turkey to provide help to Iraqi Kurds, who have carved out an autonomous enclave in northern Iraq. 
 Each year the war inside Turkey grows bigger. In 1993, 4,000 civilians, soldiers and guerrillas were killed. At least 800 villages have been evacuated to deny a base to the leftist Kurdistan Workers Party, better known by its initials P.K.K. In January, 50 Turkish warplanes struck at a P.K.K. camp deep within Iraq's Kurdish territory, the biggest such raid so far.
Though it faces a huge budget deficit and roaring inflation, Turkey spent $7 billion on the war last year. Yet neither the Government nor the army appears to have a political strategy for ending this conflict.
Kurds account for one-fifth of Turkey's 60 million people, and their demand for cultural and political rights has a long history. After years of insisting that Kurds were only "mountain Turks," Ankara explored a different approach under President Turgut Ozal. Turkish Kurds were allowed to form their own party, which briefly became part of the governing coalition formed in 1991 by Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel. There were cheers abroad when Mr. Demirel promised greater language rights, as well as other legal reforms long urged by human rights advocates.
But hope faded when President Ozal died last April and was succeeded by Mr. Demirel. This shift then brought to power Tansu Ciller, the first woman to serve as Prime Minister. Mr. Demirel, who had been twice ousted by the armed forces in times past, and the untested Prime Minister have joined hard-liners in treating the Kurdish rebellion as foremost a military matter. To be sure, they have been abetted in this by the P.K.K.'s terrorist offenses, including the killing of Turks in Germany, where as many as 400,000 out of 1.6 million Turkish "guest workers" are Kurds.
Americans learned at bitter cost in Vietnam that aerial attacks neither pacify nor win hearts and minds in hostile villages. It is hard to imagine any military victory in Turkey, given the sheer size of the Kurdish minority. And dismayingly, military escalation has closed down the political track to a settlement. Having banned a Kurdish-based political party, the Government is now detaining five Kurdish members of Parliament on fishy charges of "sedition," a capital offense. Meantime, Amnesty International has kept detailed track of "disappearances" -- 26 in 1993 -- of mainly Kurdish prisoners.
These are alarming symptoms of a deeper fever. Turkish officials fear that granting cultural autonomy to Kurds only increases the clamor for full independence. But that has not been so in Spain, where Catalan and Basque separatist movements have ebbed with greater devolution. In any case, recalling that the Nixon Administration once cynically used Iraqi Kurds as pawns, Americans have special cause to look critically at this ominous war.

Get Ready for ARF

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER 

 BODY:
East Asia, from Seoul to Singapore, is now the world's axis for expanding trade and economic growth. Any interruption of that region's growth would reverberate around the globe. Fortunately, most economic indicators point toward further expansion -- provided there is continued political stability and peace. With that in mind, East Asian nations are preparing to launch, this July, a promising new vehicle for avoiding military conflicts. It is called the Asean Regional Forum, or ARF.
It has received scant attention in the West, even though the U.S. will be an important participant. It is not a military alliance like NATO or a collective security organization like Europe's Conference on Security and Cooperation. But, in time, it could come to play a central role in American strategy for the Asia-Pacific region. 
 Since the end of the Vietnam War, East Asia has been largely free of war and the destruction, diversion of resources and political turmoil that go with it. Peace has brought investor confidence, reliable trade links, a stable and productive work force and rising levels of affluence. But any relapse into armed conflict could abruptly turn economic miracle into catastrophe.
The risk is limited, but real. The cold war is over everywhere else, but the risk of ideologically based fighting still haunts the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan Straits. Elsewhere, territorial disputes remain dangerously unresolved, including claims by six nations to the potentially oil rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
Meanwhile, mainland China is investing heavily in modernized military equipment that could be used to intervene beyond Chinese borders. Prominent Japanese politicians are talking openly about discarding the constraints that have bottled up Japanese military power since World War II. And many Asians worry that an inward-looking United States may be psychologically disengaging itself from the region's security.
No one is more alert to the new dangers than the prosperous but vulnerable countries of developing Asia. The Regional Forum began as a project of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei. Already, it is far more than a paper organization. Informal Asean seminars have encouraged cooperative development of disputed areas in the Spratlys and promoted exchanges of military information, along with joint training exercises to build up confidence and damp down paranoia.
The forum is no longer limited to Asean. It also includes, among others, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Vietnam and the U.S. Conspicuously excluded, however, are two of the region's most dangerous potential flash points, Taiwan and North Korea. If it is to live up to its ambition of preventing regional conflict, the Regional Forum must eventually embrace the entire region.
For decades, security in the Asia-Pacific region has been built around America's cold war treaties with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and others. Those treaties remain. But their governing assumption was that the enemy would always be international Communism; they provide little guidance or reassurance in disputes that pit one U.S. ally against another. The Asean Regional Forum can. That gives Washington a strong interest in encouraging its development. DAVID C. UNGER

2 Climbdowns, 1 Climb-Up

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: NICE

 BODY:
Two climbdowns and one climb-up illuminate the state of politics in Europe today.
In Britain, where the Conservatives are split between Euro-lovers and Euro-skeptics, Prime Minister John Major made a puny, pitiful effort to strengthen the voice of the minority in the expanding European Union. He clambered atop the ramparts, derided his Labor opposition as "Monsieur Oui, the French poodle" -- but then had to climb down again, his tail between his own poodlish legs. 
 As a result of this latest in a series of climbdowns, Mr. Major's days at No. 10 Downing Street may be numbered. Because he came to power by helping to engineer a leaders' coup against Margaret Thatcher, it is fitting that he be replaced by another party coup; the Conservatives in power think they can avoid changing places by regularly changing faces.
That's why Michael Heseltine (Cassius as played by Kirk Douglas) is again grasping at the greasy pole; my long-shot bet is on Michael Portillo, unknown in America, but a more rigorous rightist with no recent record of regicide.
The out-of-power Labor Party has come to like the notion of political and social integration with Europe because that subordination of diversity to bureaucracy is the only way Socialists -- rejected at the polls almost everywhere -- can homogenize society. So long as Conservatives can portray the opposition as pawns of Brussels bureaucrats, and can present Thatcherism with an ever-changing face, they'll win.
Here in France, where another decent, halfhearted man of the right is Prime Minister, climbdown is a way of life. Up on the ramparts went Edouard Balladur to privatize and streamline the franc-hemorrhaging Air France; the unions objected in the streets and down he came.
Up this supposed conservative went again to give unemployed teens a chance at work experience by reducing the minimum wage. The offended youth marched, burned some cars and broke storekeepers' windows as cops looked on; Balladur struck his colors and again let policy be made in the streets.
To placate rioters, French taxpayers will now subsidize businesses that hire the otherwise unemployable. This is the same route Boris Yeltsin is taking in Russia, foolishly subsidizing dinosaur industries to tamp down unrest for the time being. It breeds inflation and self-defeating protection, buying politicians temporary power before the inevitable collapse.
Italy's disgust with its demonstrably corrupt political establishment may be leading that nation in the opposite direction. The sudden rise of Silvio Berlusconi, the media mogul of the people, signaled a desire for wholesale change. Italians threw out the Old Right without turning to the left.
Mr. Berlusconi (Ted Turner and Ross Perot as played by NBC's Mike Schneider) used his own ill-gotten media outlets in a colossal confluence of interest to tout his Forza Italia. The marketing man first found out what the voters wanted -- less spending, lower taxes, a little honesty -- and then rode to victory on a white television charger.
Unfortunately, "Il Cavaliere" is allied with a group that wants to saw off southern Italy and float it out to sea, and another group of renamed fascists that espouses the corporate state. (Benito Mussolini's granddaughter won a seat; it's a lucky thing for Germany that Hitler didn't have attractive progeny.)
Europe's democracies decide their own fates, but Americans are allowed to root for their favorites:
We can root for Berlusconi in Italy to keep his anti-tax-and-spend promises and divest himself of his corrupting media empire.
We can root for Balladur in France to be dumped by rightists who can then present a candidate with le gumption to face down rioters and end the tyranny of the minorities.
We can root for Major in Britain to give way to a Conservative leader who will fight to preserve political diversity and local power within a European economic union.
And when an embattled American President travels to Omaha Beach in two months to celebrate the golden anniversary of D-Day, we can hope one part of his message will be: govern on what you campaigned for, and don't be so quick to climb down.

HEADLINE: Small Hospitals Being Recruited To Join With Manhattan Giants

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Until recently, doctors and administrators at Manhattan's prestigious medical centers looked down on the city's dozens of smaller hospitals, which they referred to condescendingly as community hospitals populated by L.M.D.'s, short for "local medical docs."
But today, with new economic pressures driving the organization of health care, the big-name institutions are aggressively courting those same hospitals, offering to affiliate in exchange for perquisites like low-interest loans to improve weak departments, consultations with internationally recognized academic experts and professorships at some of the best medical schools in the world. 
 One result is the emergence of a few huge hospital networks in the New York area, and a constantly shifting landscape of hospital alliances that make Balkan politics seem simple in comparison. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, and Columbia-Presbyterian and Mount Sinai Hospitals each already have more than half a dozen smaller hospitals in their respective stables -- mostly in the four boroughs outside Manhattan and in Westchester -- and are actively negotiating with many more.
Such consolidation is taking place all over the country, but is most striking in New York, where hospitals until recently have turned a blind eye to the inevitable arrival of managed care. Now, they feel under pressure to catch up.
"Everyone is talking with everyone else," said Dr. William T. Speck, the president of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, recounting the search for new partners. "You walk into a hospital and think it's perfect for you and then you find out that Dr. Skinner from New York Hospital was there yesterday and Dr. Rowe from Mount Sinai is coming tomorrow."
For the parent hospital, affiliating with smaller institutions brings a steady flow of referrals for tertiary care, highly specialized and often expensive medical procedures, like bypass surgery, that the medical giants need to survive and the community hospitals often cannot perform. And, since most of the smaller hospitals that have signed up cater to working people, most of the patients they refer are insured.
In return, the smaller affiliates get the connection with a big-name hospital and its resources, which they hope will prove a lifeline as other small hospitals are forced to close amid demands for greater efficiency.
But more than that, hospitals large and small are looking toward the future, hoping that their new networks will be attractive to insurers, health maintenance organizations and large companies seeking a full range of medical services for members or employees at a fixed price.
 
The Small and Poor May Be Left Out
 These networks are part of a transformation of medical care in the New York region that seems inevitable whatever the fate of health reform in Washington, as more New Yorkers are pushed into cost-conscious health plans that restrict patients' choices of doctors and hospitals.
"Hospitals are all afraid that when the dust settles there will only be a few efficient health systems operating in New York, and they want to be included in one that's there," said Dr. John W. Rowe, president of Mount Sinai Medical Center.
With the fast pace of consolidations, regulators are already worried that the big networks in New York will not do a good job of serving local communities and that small hospitals in poor neighborhoods will be left out.
The new partnerships often bring together the strangest of bedfellows. The main entrance of Presbyterian Hospital, flanked by the tenements of Washington Heights, can rival a midtown subway station in its bustle and chaos, as hundreds of people stream in each hour. Meanwhile, its new Brooklyn affiliate, Victory Memorial, sits next to a duck pond and a golf course. One recent afternoon there, only four people sat on leatherette chairs in a tidy lobby, and everyone seemed to know each other by name.
At Presbyterian, many patients are minority members on Medicaid, and are poor. At Victory, they are largely white, middle class and well insured. At Presbyterian, with its Ivy League connection, the doctors are culled from the best American medical schools; at Victory, many are foreign graduates.
But today, these very different hospitals have been driven together by a common fear: being left out of the revolution in the health care industry.
"We are trying to prepare for what we think is down the road, when you're going to have to be part of a health-care entity that third-party payers and H.M.O.'s are going to negotiate with," said J. Donald Di Cunto, president of the board of trustees at Victory Memorial.
Paul F. Macielak, vice president for government, community and public affairs at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, used similar terms for the motivation of the medical giants, saying that larger hospitals must reach out for new patients.
"With the trend towards managed care, academic centers have to have a broad base of patients to survive," he said. "If I'm Citibank and I have employees all over the New York region, I'm going to want to contract with a network that has facilities everywhere."
But some health care regulators worry that what makes financial sense for hospitals may not be good for patients. The New York State Department of Health is considering whether to regulate these partnerships out of concern that the smaller hospitals will become mere referral banks for Manhattan's giants, giving little to the communities in return.
"We are now looking at the question of how to deal with these new beasts," said Dr. Mark R. Chassin, the State Commissioner of Health.
Although the parent hospitals insist they will become involved in redressing the historically uneven quality of care in the boroughs outside Manhattan, Dr. Chassin said he was skeptical. For example, he said it was unlikely that the parent hospitals would be willing to accept legal liability for malpractice claims at their affiliates.
He also said he worried that hospitals in poorer areas that served mainly patients on Medicaid had been left out of the bidding war.
"In general, the more financially distressed hospitals that we regard as central to providing care in low-income communities have not been the first places the large networks have looked," Dr. Chassin said.
 
Geographic Diversity Is Goal of Alliances
 But Dr. Speck of Presbyterian Hospital said that the large medical centers wanted to forge alliances with hospitals in geographically diverse regions. Presbyterian, he added, recently affiliated with Horton Hospital in Middletown, N.Y., which was in financial distress. Mount Sinai is negotiating with the city to manage two public hospitals in Queens.
And administrators at academic centers say the issue may be moot anyway, since they hope that the nation will have some form of universal health coverage in the next five years, assuring that no patient will be a financial risk.
"My sense is that what's going on out there is a scramble to obtain bodies, and people don't seem concerned about third-party payers versus Medicare or Medicaid," said Mr. Macielak of New York Hospital.
Nonetheless, Victory -- a typical small-town hospital that just happens to be in New York -- is a near perfect partner from the perspective of Manhattan's medical giants.
"Our patient base, and the method in which we maintain the hospital, made us attractive," said Mr. Di Cunto. "We were never financially stressed, so it would not have been necessary to pour in large amounts of money.
"Our equipment is state of the art, and we can give them the tertiary care work they need," he said, referring to giving Presbyterian the procedures that Victory cannot perform.
Victory does not perform neurosurgery, cardiac catheterization or open heart operations -- procedures that generate large revenues for big referral centers. And it does have a brand-new 10-bed cardiac intensive-care unit and a 25-bed cardiac monitoring floor, which turn out a steady flow of patients who need such care. Only about 5 percent of Victory's patients are on Medicaid.
But Victory does have its problems, including the highest Caesarian section rate in New York State, which has approached 50 percent for years. Dr. Speck said that Columbia-Presbyterian would address the issue.
The terms of the affiliation agreements vary greatly depending on the partners involved. But they are far more expansive than the traditional links between hospitals, which generally involved an agreement between a primary care hospital and an academic referral center or medical school for a particular service, like providing residents for a surgery ward or transferring sick newborns in need of intensive care.
Academic titles, once jealously guarded at New York's major hospitals, are now offered to some doctors at the community hospitals to emphasize the new camaraderie and to provide inducements to affiliate.
New York Hospital, which began the affiliation trend in the region, has favored agreements akin to leveraged buyouts: the parent hospital's network can appoint the board of the smaller hospital which, in turn, loses considerable decision-making power. To save money, business, marketing and personnel departments are merged.
How this loss of autonomy will affect medical care at the smaller hospitals is unclear, but in theory the network could close down a department at a small hospital to make the system more efficient.
 
Some Not Ready For 'Leap of Faith'
 "If we have two hospitals that duplicate services in the same area, our intent would be to bring two together," said Dr. David B. Skinner, president of New York Hospital, adding: "There's no question that some of the hospitals we would be interested in are not ready to take the leap of faith required to join the netowrk, to say, 'Here are the keys to the hospital and we trust that what you will do will be good for the place.' "
In contrast, Mount Sinai and Columbia-Presbyterian have favored loose contracts in which the smaller hospital retains its own board of directors and a large degree of autonomy. Depending on the smaller hospital's needs, the parent institution may agree to provide a variety of services, from help in shoring up a weak pediatrics unit to laundry service to the joint buying of medical supplies at volume discounts.
Although New York University Medical Center has been slow to embark on affiliations, it has recently begun to seek partners as well.
Administrators at hospitals large and small have debated endlessly about which arrangements leave them best positioned for the future.
Dr. Skinner, the president of New York Hospital, says he believes that a tightly knit hospital network will be most efficient.
But Dr. Speck of Columbia-Presbyterian questioned the wisdom of acquiring hospitals at a time when the trend is to outpatient care. "To me, developing hospitals is like collecting Edsels," he said.
Following this logic, Mount Sinai is now trying to draw patients into its network by bypassing the hospitals and negotiating directly with several large group practices of physicians -- an approach that Beth Israel Medical Center has also tried. But this strategy, which has worked in many other parts of the country, may have limited value in the New York area, since most doctors here practice individually or with only a few colleagues.
So as the mating dance goes on, many smaller hospitals debate which princely suitor best fits their needs.
"We feel we're a pretty successful hospital, medically and financially, and we want to preserve whatever autonomy we have -- which we could not do with the agreement New York Hospital was offering us," said an administrator at a small hospital outside Manhattan, which has recently broken off negotiations with New York Hospital and begun discussions with Mount Sinai. He refused to be identified for fear it would jeopardize the hospital's bargaining position.
And, he added: "There's also a lot of pride that goes along with this. We think they need us more than we need them. I'm sure they think the opposite."
 
HEALTH CARE
A NEW ERA FOR HOSPITALS
 
Large hospitals are joining with small ones in sweeping agreements to cooperate in a wide variety of programs including marketing, billing, purchasing and medical education as well as general patient care. One result is the formation of several expanding hospital networks in the New York area.
 
The new partnerships are very different from the narrow academic relationships that New York's medical schools have long cultivated with community hospitals, in which they provide a particular medical service, generally residents to work in the smaller hospitals' wards. Hospital administrators say that at least some of these traditional relationships are likely to expand signficantly.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Conservative's Star Soars On Words About Whitewater

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Who is Robert Bartley?
 Before Whitewater turned The Wall Street Journal's ardent chief of editorials into a media personality, he was already the darling of conservatives.
 
 But a headline - "Who is Vincent Foster?" - and its aftermath have broadened his role. At 56, Robert L. Bartley, editor of The Journal, has become a star in the very "liberal media" he abhors. His role: Whitewater sage.
 With a new prominence that began with the editorial attack last summer on Mr. Foster, the deputy White House counsel who died on July 20 in an apparent suicide, Mr. Bartley slashes away at the Clinton administration. He sneers at the Democrats, Little Rock and anyone who calls the 1980's the decade of greed. And sometimes he even appears to scorn the reporters at his own newspaper.
 The open secret at The Journal for years has been the discomfort such sentiments sometimes cause employees of the newspaper's news operation and the ridicule some of them apply to the paper's editorial positions. The news division is separate from the editorial page and its employees report to a different top editor, Paul E. Steiger, the newspaper's managing editor, Mr. Steiger and Mr. Bartley report separately to Peter R. Kann, The Journal's chairman and publisher.
 
News Source of Conflicts
 Some news department employees consider themselves political liberals. Some also find their news reports occasionally contradicted or undercut by their own newspaper's editorials. Whitewater has provided a new series of such opportunities for conflict.
 The editorial page has sometimes heaped praise on news organizations other than The Journal for ocurage in pursuing Whitewater leads. The New York Post has been especially warmly appreciated. At times, it has appeared that The Journal's editorial page is insulting its own news operation by omission.
 The differing approaches of the two sides of the same newspaper have begun to attract outside attention. The New Republic recently took note of two Journal headlines from the March 14 issue that reported the start of an investigation by the Whitewater special counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr.
 A Journal news headline that day: "Fiske Gets Off to Fast Start in Whitewater Probe by Moving Forward Aggressively on All Fronts."
 The editorial page headline the same day: "The Fiske Cover-Up II."
 the Journal's senior news editors insist they are not insulted. But Alan Murray, the deputy Washington bureau chief, does acknowledge that "there is this tradition of not just separation but competition - or enmity."
 Mr. Bartley, who says his Iowa upbringing in the 1950's provided a standard of values to measure current events, appears to be reveling in the role he calls spokesman for the loyal opposition. "There's a certain kind of fun that we're having again now that we had during the Carter years," Mr. Bartley said of the mood among his staff of 30 or so conservative editorial page writers and editors.
 "You get up in the morning and say, 'O.K., what are they doing now that we can criticize?" he said.
 Before the current "bumbling Presidency," as The Journal's editorials like to call it, the soft-spoken Mr. Bartley may have been best known among conservatives for editorials that helped establish the supply-side economic underpinnings of the Reagan years. He was favored, too, for commentary that described how the 1960's ruined the country.
 But lately, Mr. Bartley has been reaching a wider audience. He is seen on "Meet the Press" one day and on "Carlie Rose" another. And New York magazine is describing the rambunctiously conservative editorial page he has edited since 1972 as "smart, ferocious and very, very powerful."
 
A "Who is" Theme
 The "Who Is Vincent Foster?" editorial that started all this attention was one of several last summer that criticized Mr. Foster and other Clinton Administration lawyers from the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. A note found in Mr. Foster's briefcase after his death said, among other things, that "the WSJ editors lie without consequence."
 This winter, there have been new "who is" editorials. They have been aimed at "Friends of Bill" and at "Hillary," as Mrs. Clinton is often called on The Journal's editorial page (as in "Hillary in the Pits," the headline of an editorial last week on her commodities trading profits).
 The Journal's editorial page has been boisterous in its suggestions that the Administration has been tainted by "congentially violent" Little Rock and that Clinton aides are involved in cover-ups.
 Some of the editorials offer new information dug up by The Journal's editorial page staff. These "reported editorials," as The Journal calls them, have deived into the Clintons' Arkansas connections and raised questions abuot the investigation into Mr. Foster's death.
 
Questions of Tone
 If there is criticism - and there is - that the tone of the editorial page turned taunting after Mr. Foster's apparent suicide, Mr. Bartley does not appear concerned. "If you have a good story, run with it," he said.
 Some Journal watchers say they are offended. "To me, it's so mean-spirited," said Stephen Hess, a media analyst at the Brookings Institution and a Republican who worked in the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations.
 "It seems to take such joy in every foot fault of the President and everyone close to him," Mr. Hess said. "It's as if they are really trying to bring down a Presidency."
 Mr. Bartley denies that. Still, after an interlude following Mr. Foster's death last summer. The Journal's editorial page returned in mid-December to its "Who Is Vincent Foster?" themes.
 
A Different Reaction
 All the respectful attention from the media lately, Mr. Bartley said in his office at The Journal last week, is "the other side of the coin." He said the reaction was the opposite of what occurred after Mr. Foster's death.
 "People," he said, "were assigning us a sense of responsibility." But a newspaper cannot be held accountable for the effects of depression in an official it covers, he has said repeatedly.
 Mr. Bartley said he did not understand criticism that The Journal's editorials are mean in tone. "Look," he said, "we write lively editorials."
 To be sure, The Journal's editorial page has never been shy, at least since Mr. Bartley took over in 1972. It has had clear likes (Oliver North, Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan and the junk bonds of Michael Milken) and dislikes (cultural elites, Lani Guinier and "frantic propagandists" and "left-wing lobbyists" like Common Cause and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People). Mr. Bartley won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1980.
 His top deputy, Daniel Henninger, wrote one of the best-known recent Journal editorials, "No Guardrails," in March. If concluded that it was possible to specify when America "began to tip off the emotional tracks." According to The Journal, it was in August 1968, during the antiwar demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
 
Support at Dow Jones
 Mr. Bartley's stewardship of the editorial page clearly has the support of senior officials at Dow Jones & Company, which publishes The Journal. Mr. Bartley has been a vice president fo the newspaper and a member of the company's management committee for a decade. In an interview last week, Mr. Kann called Mr. Bartley "One of the genuine intellectual leaders of America."
 In person, the bespectacled Mr. Bartley is so deferential that he appears to cringe at being the object of interest. His sentences are interrupted with pauses and it is nearly impossible to detect the table pounding that is so familiar on his editorial page.
 Mr. Kann and others who have known him for years say it is part of Mr. Bartley's writer's personality to reserve his passions for the printed page. Mr. Bartley was briefly a reporter for The Journal in the arly 1960's and joined the editorial page staff in 1964.
 What he perceived as the hypocrisy of the left in the 1960's, he said, began his drift from moderate Republicanism toward the right. As the foundation of his thinking, he cites his youth in Ames, Iowa, where society's structure and the values of individual responsibility made sense.
 "The pendulum," he said, "has gone too far and we need to go back and think about individual responsibility and the values that come with that kind of upbringing.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Report Labels Nigeria Major Trafficker of Drugs to U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The State Department said today that some Nigerians, with the help of their Government, have created global drug trafficking networks in Europe and Asia that officials estimate provide 35 percent to 40 percent of the heroin that enters the United States.
The report, an annual world survey of drug cultivation and trafficking, also describes a dramatic expansion of Russian criminal groups involved in smuggling and distributing heroin from Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, where heroin production continues to increase. 
 The report was mandated by Congress in 1986 as a way to withhold aid and international loans from countries found to be not "fully cooperating" with Washington's antidrug efforts. But over the years it has become an annual admission of the worldwide inability to curb the production and export of cocaine, heroin and marijuana.
No ally of the United States has ever been economically penalized for a lack of cooperation, and in a memorandum with the report President Clinton announced penalties only against nations with which Washington has no relations or only severely strained relations: Myanmar, Iran, Nigeria and Syria.
Nigeria, whose citizens have been arrested in almost every country where heroin has been seized, from Poland to Saudi Arabia, was placed on the list for the first time. Last year Nigeria ignored repeated appeals by the Administration to crack down on traffickers and failed to apprehend and extradite several major fugitive traffickers indicted in the United States.
"Nigeria has become a major source of trafficking around the world, as Nigerian trafficking organizations have become one of the most extraordinary, organized phenomena of carrying heroin and cocaine both into the United States and Europe," said Robert Gelbard, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, who briefed reporters. "We calculate that some 35 to 40 percent of all heroin coming into the United States comes from Nigerians who bring it into this country."
Mr. Gelbard said Nigerians involved in the drug networks "are not random mules, or individuals who are doing this on a free-lancing basis."
"These are people working for very organized groups, which we have felt is with the protection of Government officials," he added. Cocaine, for example, enters Nigeria primarily from Brazil for re-export to Europe and for regional and domestic consumption, the report says.
 
Syria's Role
 As for Syria, Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled an initial State Department recommendation that the country be rewarded for some modest antidrug measures after some of his senior aides and some White House officials questioned the wisdom of such a politically sensitive move.
The report says Syria's military presence in Lebanon makes it "at least partly accountable" for the cultivation and processing of Lebanese heroin, hashish and cocaine destined for Europe, the Persian Gulf and the United States.
"It's one of the issues which remains, for obvious reasons, a major bilateral problem," Mr. Gelbard said.
 
6 Countries Singled Out
 In his memorandum, Mr. Clinton singled out Afghanistan, Bolivia, Laos, Panama, Peru and Lebanon as other countries that did not cooperate sufficently with antidrug efforts, but he waived economic sanctions because of unspecified "vital national interests."
One worrisome trend, the report says, is that Russia has become "a central marketing point" for heroin from Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. The drug is moved overland to Europe, with the potential to destabilize fragile governments along the way, the report says.
"Criminal organizations in Russia have set up supply routes to Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia," the report adds, while other supply lines move drugs to the Baltic ports.
Inside Russia, seizures of hashish, opium, heroin and cocaine doubled last year. The authorities report 1.5 million Russians use drugs, and cite the growing use of cocaine among rich young people.
 
Where Money Intersects
 Because of an absence of controls and legislation, laundering of drug money in Russia is a "growing problem," the report says. Russia is also emerging as a drug producer, the report says, and the Russian authorities have reported the seizure of 215 drug-making laboratories, including amphetamine operations created with stolen Government equipment.
In Afghanistan, which after Myanmar is the world's second-largest opium producer, opium poppy production rose almost 9 percent last year, the report says. Drug cultivation and trafficking is also reported to be gaining ground in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
In Central America, the report says Panama has shown a "disappointing lack of political will to address drug corruption and money-laundering schemes." As a result of its sophisticated banking structure, lenient regulation and inefficient enforcement, Panama has become Latin America's leading center for money laundering, the report adds.
"While they have taken -- or tried to take -- some steps in a few areas, such as eradicating coca that's been found on their southern border near Colombia," Mr. Gelbard said. "Panama has increasingly become a major money-laundering center, and we have held ample discussions with Panamanian authorities, as have international banking organizations, about the extraordinarily concerns we have."
 
A Look at Southeast Asia
 The report also noted that in Southeast Asia, heroin cultivation increased 7 percent last year, while production rose 10 percent. Global production of heroin increased 5.5 percent last year, opening new marketing opportunities for international crime rings.
Cocaine production, by contrast, declined slightly last year, but not because coca-producing countries had managed to curb production. Rather Peru, which produces about 56 percent of the world's supply of coca, lost 16 percent of its crop to a fungus.
Cocaine use, which was once a peculiarly American phenomenon, has become "a worldwide scourge," the report says.
Although the report, known as the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, was issued today to Congress and news organizations, it is not available to the public.

HEADLINE: MARKETS IN TURMOIL;
Small Investors Step to Sidelines As Rates Jump and Stocks Fall

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Individual investors, whose willingness to buy has rescued the stock and bond markets numerous times in the last several years, refused to do so yesterday as interest rates soared to their highest level in more than a year and stock prices fell sharply.
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds jumped to 7.41 percent, the highest since January 1993. A week ago, the rate was below 7 percent, making this period one of the sharpest for interest rate rises in recent years. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 42.61 points, or 1.2 percent, yesterday, and is now 9.7 percent below the high it set on Jan. 31. Many market analysts have been predicting a stock market "correction" of about 10 percent, though some have foreseen a larger drop. The summer of 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, was the last time the stock market suffered a 10 percent pullback.
Market analysts focused their attention on interest rates.
"Until you stabilize the bond market, you won't stabilize the stock market," said Steven Einhorn, the co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
President Clinton, seeking to reassure investors, said yesterday that he thought interest rates were now too high and he predicted that they would decline.
Higher interest rates have already begun to affect some consumers because many variable rate mortgages and credit card loans are pegged either to the prime lending rate, which has been raised by many banks, or to other market rates that have risen.
The run-up in interest rates has come amid signs of a strong economy, which encourages increased borrowing by businesses seeking to expand, and amid concerns that the Federal Reserve Board, which has tightened credit twice in the last two months, will soon do so again. Yesterday, bond prices were hurt by a forecast that inflation would pick up soon and by a warning of sharply higher interest rates down the road from Henry Kaufman, a noted econmist.
Some mutual fund groups reported selling by their shareholders. Perhaps more important, there was little interest in buying, fund groups reported, in contrast to previous recent market downturns.
Rarely since the period around the 1987 stock market crash have stock prices moved more erratically than during the last two trading days, with huge declines followed by quick rallies. Stocks plunged sharply when the market opened yesterday, only to recover for most of the morning. They plunged again in early afternoon and then recovered part of the losses by the last hour of trading.
 
Previous Wild Session
 On Thursday, the last trading day before the market closed for Good Friday, there had been similar wild moves, but the Dow average managed to end the day with a small gain.
During the last several years, individual investors, acting both through direct purchases of stocks and through mutual funds, have come in to buy whenever prices weakened. But in the last week, that source of buying has largely dried up, and there appears to have been some modest individual selling.
"It isn't huge selling," said Robert Farrell, a senior market analyst at Merrill Lynch, but he said that many individual investors were no longer interested in searching for bargains but were instead waiting nervously on the sidelines to see what happens.
The big increase in volatility has surprised many market analysts and investors, who had grown used to very low volatility over the last two years. The turbulence evidently helped persuade many investors to put off any plans to buy.
 
Buyers Are Few
 "You have a buyers' strike," said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., market analysis firm. He said that whenever large orders to sell stocks appeared, buyers seemed to back away.
There was no shortage of bearish, or pessimistic, forecasts about the markets yesterday. Mr. Kaufman, an economist who runs his own money management firm, warned in a statement that by the time the economy peaks in the next few years, the rate on Treasury bonds could be 9 percent or more, despite a good inflation outlook, largely because of the strength of the economy.
And Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research said its index that seeks to forecast inflation had risen for the sixth consecutive month.
At the same time yesterday, some who focus on value were looking to buy stocks that might have reached bargain price levels as gauged by such factors as a stock's price, the dividend it pays or the company's prospect for increased earnings in months to come.
Byron Wien, the chief domestic equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, said he was recommending buying stocks. "I don't know whether the bottom is here, but it is time to commit some reserves," said Mr. Wien, who had been forecasting a 10 percent stock market decline since December and had been warning that Treasury bond yields would rise above 7.25 percent.
 
Seeing Bargains
 John Neff, the manager of the $10.5 billion Vanguard Windsor Fund, who had previously raised the cash level in his fund to a very high 20 percent -- a sign of an expected decline in prices -- said yesterday that he had made heavy purchases of stocks both Thursday and yesterday.
"You can get some pretty good prices," Mr. Neff said, declining to name specific stocks. "We may be early," he added. "You can say the correction will be 15 percent or 20 percent. But what if it's 10 percent?" Traditionally, a 10 percent decline is seen as indicating a significant market pullback.
The markets have been sliding since Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve disclosed it was pushing for a modest increase in short-term interest rates, in part to head off any threat of revived inflation. For the last several months the economy has been growing rapidly, after a long period of sluggish activity, and few economists say that the modest increases mandated by the Fed are likely to bring a new recession soon.
But during the long period when interest rates were falling, many investors had borrowed heavily to buy bonds. With bond prices now falling, many of those investors have suffered losses and are being forced to sell in order to raise cash and pay back their loans. This has led to great nervousness on Wall Street that such selling will continue. Since interest rates move in the opposite direction as bond prices, that selling may have pushed rates higher than would otherwise have happened.
 
Down From a High
 The stock market decline comes at a time when stock prices had advanced to levels that were extraordinarily high by many traditional valuation measures. For example, at the top of the market a couple of months ago, an investor who bought all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index could expect to earn an annual return from dividends of just 2.65 percent. That was almost exactly the level reached at two previous major market tops, in January 1973 and August 1987, noted Arnold Kaufman, the editor of the Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter. Now, with prices having fallen, the yield is back up to 2.94 percent, still a relatively low level by historic standards.
Yesterday, after the initial selloff, the stock market put on an impressive rally, climbing nearly 50 points from the low of the day. But as bond prices plunged -- pushing rates up -- that rally evaporated.

Fed Disinclined to Act On Short-Term Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The tumble of the stock and bond markets has surprised Federal Reserve officials but has not persuaded them so far to change short-term interest rates.
Fed officials say they are inclined for now to let investors determine the prices of shares or long-term interest rates, over which the central bank exerts limited influence. 
 "I don't think that we should be in the business of trying to, in effect, speculate ourselves on what long-term interest rates should be," said Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Fed governor.
In an interview this morning, Mr. Kelley also doubted that share prices would continue their steep decline. "It's hard for me to see how they can go to pieces in the context of a strong economy," he said.
President Clinton, in Cleveland for a baseball game, sought to reassure bond investors today. "Interest rates are still lower than they were at the bottom of the recession," he said in an interview with NBC Newschannel. "I think they're too high. I think they'll come back down."
 
Direction Is Unclear
 Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said Mr. Clinton was referring to long-term interest rates, which averaged 8.29 percent for 30-year Treasury bonds at the bottom of the recession in March 1991.
It is not clear in which direction the Fed would move if it changed short-term rates. Private economists think it would raise rates to slow economic growth and reassure the bond markets that inflation was under control.
But such an increase would make stocks, with their fixed dividends, even less attractive to investors than money market funds, possibly driving the stock market down further. Lowering short-term rates would make stocks more appealing but risk further harm to bond markets.
Susan M. Phillips, another Fed governor, also said she had few worries about the financial markets. "We're certainly watching them," she said in an interview tonight. "I can't go as far as alarm."
While investors may be hurt by the recent downturn, she said, the stock market remains high enough to fulfill its basic economic function of providing financing for companies. On Thursday she said that "when the stock market is no longer capable of providing a source of financing, that seems to be more of a consideration" in setting monetary policy.
 
Fed Funds Rate Raised
 The Fed raised the interest rate for overnight loans between banks, the Fed funds rate, on Feb. 4 and again on March 22. The two increases, each a quarter percentage point, have pushed this rate up to 3.5 percent.
Long-term interest rates rose after the first rate increase but dropped temporarily after the second. Higher short-term rates tend to slow economic growth and inflation, reassuring investors that if they lend money for long periods they will not be repaid in dollars heavily devalued by inflation.
Economists say that the first increase failed to reassure investors, even alarming them by signaling that the Fed was worried about inflation.
Fed officials are acutely aware that any move to raise or lower the Fed funds rate, which the Fed controls, would have unpredictable effects on stock and bond markets, which the Fed does not control. Long-term rates have risen 1.11 percentage points since Feb. 4, surprising Fed officials, who view the increase as unjustified.
"Given what I would regard as a realistic outlook for inflation, I was surprised they have run up as far as they have," Mr. Kelley said.
 
Effect on Economy Feared
 Administration officials fear that a further rise in long-term rates could slow economic growth.
Mr. Kelley played down the announcement last Friday of a sharp increase in nonfarm jobs during March, saying it was more appropriate to look at the average rate of monthly job creation for the entire first quarter. The average rate was 200,000 jobs a month, as opposed to the 456,000 in March cited by the Labor Department, and Mr. Kelley said such a level did not by itself signal inflation ahead.
"I think it's more useful to focus on a rate of 200,000 a month, and I think there's nothing inherently inflationary for some period of time about that," he said.
But Mr. Kelley said he remained concerned that the economy was growing at a pace that would eventually feed inflation. "As one looks a year out, one has to see a potential for renewed inflationary pressures as we approach full utilization of the economy," he said.
The nation's central bank changed policy sharply after the stock market crash on Oct. 19, 1987, pushing down the interest rate for overnight loans between banks by a full percentage point over the next several months.

Four Seasons Hotels For Sale, With a Catch

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
Isadore Sharp, the Toronto hotelier who founded the Four Seasons chain 34 years ago, has decided to check out of the hotel business.
The catch is, he has no intention of actually packing up and vacating for at least three more years. And in the meantime, he expects the new owners to give him the run of the place. 
 Four Seasons Hotels Inc. has hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to help it find a buyer. But Mr. Sharp, who controls 20 percent of the company's stock but 80 percent of the votes, said yesterday that he would insist that the buyer postpone the deal's closing for three to five years to allow for a smooth transition.
"What we're talking about is an orderly transition of succession," Mr. Sharp said in an interview. "It's an issue of controlling the process and that's what my control block allows me to do."
Under his proposal, the new owners would buy roughly 22 million public shares outstanding now and would be expected to purchase Mr. Sharp's 5.6 million super-voting shares later at the same price.
Not surprisingly, investors and hotel industry executives said they doubted that many buyers would line up to meet the company on its terms, especially given its well-known financial problems.
 
'Grasping at Straws'
 "They're kind of grasping at straws," said Stephen Bollenbach, the chief executive of Host Marriott, echoing others. His company owns hotel properties and might be interested in plucking up some Four Seasons hotels at the right price.
"Having taken this thing on this nightmare journey, now he wants someone to put money in and let him run it for five years," he said. "Give me a break. Who would do it?"
If Mr. Sharp is used to getting his way, he can be forgiven. Four Seasons operates 45 luxury hotels and resorts around the world, including Chicago's Ritz-Carlton, London's Four Seasons (formerly Inn on the Park) and the new Four Seasons in New York. The hotels are legendary for pampering guests.
Hit by recessions in prime markets, however, the company has had trouble turning a profit. The company has also been beset by real estate problems and questions that it might have overstated its profits through aggressive accounting methods.
 
6 Hotels Put on Block
 Skeptics fear that the company is running out of options, despite signs of a recovery in room rates and occupancies. It put six hotels on the block last year to raise cash, but has yet to announce a sale, partly because of its insistence that it be allowed to retain management contracts.
Yesterday, Four Seasons also announced that it would take a $120 million provision in its soon-to-be-released fourth-quarter results, which could be used to offset losses from 10 company-owned hotels.
Despite the setbacks, company officials insist that the decision to put the whole company on the block had less to do with its real estate and financial problems than with a desire for an orderly succession.
Mr. Sharp, 62, said his son Tony, a Four Seasons executive, had little desire to take over the business. "I came to this decision in concert with him, not against him," the elder Mr. Sharp said. "This is thinking of my family and letting them have their own life without having to be responsible for something I've created."
Choosing to sell, as Mr. Sharp has apparently decided to do, would give him a graceful way out, especially if he can negotiate a premium price for public shareholders. Four Seasons, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, closed yesterday at $11 (Canadian), up 12.5 cents (Canadian). But the stock is way below its high of $21.125 (Canadian) in 1989.
George Domolky, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments whose three Canadian funds own Four Seasons stock, said he thought the stock would sell for $15 to $18 a share.
Besides Host Marriott, possible buyers mentioned yesterday include the financier George Soros, Morgan Stanley, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and the Blackstone Group.

HEADLINE: Selloff of '94 Continues, With Dow Losing 42.61, to 3,593.35

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In what passes for good news these days, the stock market fell yesterday for the sixth time in the last seven sessions, but it was not the 100-point drop that many analysts had feared.
The number of shares changing hands, although higher than normal, indicated that some traders sat on their hands yesterday, waiting for further developments. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 344.4 million shares, or only 15 percent more than a typical day's volume, as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.61 points, to 3,593.35. 
 The bond market, by contrast, was in turmoil yesterday. Yet stock traders were heartened that the bond trouble did not seem to stampede the stock market. Indeed, some analysts predicted that the stock market would rally as early as this week.
 
Talking of a Rally
 And the gentler-than-expected drop yesterday prompted some market watchers to predict that the Dow Jones industrial average would again march toward 4,000 later this year. "This is the beginning of the end of the correction," said David D. Holt, vice president of research and strategy at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.
Gold, often the refuge for those alarmed by other financial markets, also seemed to indicate that investors were conducting only a careful selloff of stocks. Gold for June delivery fell $5.60, to $388.70 an ounce.
"It was not nearly as ugly as the doom sayers were predicting," said William R. Rothe, a managing director at Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore.
The Dow fell as much as 83 points yesterday before turning around. It has now dropped some 385 points, or 9.7 percent, from its Jan. 31 peak. A 10 percent market "correction" had been widely expected by analysts.
There has been a similar two-month decline in the S.& P. 500-stock index, which fell 6.84 points yesterday, to 438.92. The S.& P. has fallen some 43 points, down 8.9 percent from its Feb. 2 peak.
 
Big Drop at the Start
 The session started out troubling. A surge in sell orders in the first hour dropped the Dow by more than 50 points, setting off the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breaker" rules intended to slow market declines.
But Big Board officials lifted the circuit breaker shortly after 1 P.M. and the blue-chip index rallied for another hour until turmoil in the bond market again pulled down stocks.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which helps set costs for borrowers ranging from General Motors down to the customer on the car dealer's floor, spiked to 7.44 percent, before settling at 7.41 percent. The surge has added more than a third of a percentage point to the long bond's yield in only five sessions.
Some stock and bond traders spoke of rumors, which turned out to be false, of a secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates. Others cited comments by the economist Henry Kaufman, who predicted that long-term interest rates could rise to as much as 10 percent, although he did not specify when.
Whatever the reason, many analysts contend that bond prices have fallen far out of proportion to economic fundamentals. Frederic T. Leiner, fixed-income market strategist for Continental Bank in Chicago, said the fast run-up in yields "was too much by any of the standards that I'm familiar with in my years in the bond business."
The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 3.92 points, to 243.14. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 2,121 to 376. The American Stock Exchange market-value index dropped 8.98 points, to 434.13.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 16.05 points, to 727.41. It has fallen some 77 points, or about 9.5 percent, from its March 18 peak.
Of the 30 component stocks of the Dow industrials, 23 dropped in price, led by J. P. Morgan, which fell 2 3/4, to 60, and Woolworth, which dropped 2 1/8, to 13. Morgan was probably affected by analysts' expectations that rising interest rates would hurt the profits of financial-services companies.
Woolworth was under pressure from recent disclosures of possible financial irregularities and the temporary replacement, pending an investigation, of its chairman and chief financial officer.
Of 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index, 423 declined, including Exxon, which dropped 1 7/8, to 61, and General Electric, which fell 2, to 98.
 
Merger Deal Under Fire
 The most active Nasdaq stock was Novell, whose planned acquisition of Wordperfect has been sharply criticized by analysts. It fell 1 1/4, to 16 7/8, on volume of 7.4 million shares.
No. 2 on the Nasdaq most active list was Sun Microsystems, which fell sharply after warning securities analysts on Thursday, following the market's close, that their estimates of third-quarter revenue were too high.
Sun makes high-speed computer work stations and is planning to introduce new products. Anticipating that, some customers delayed buying existing products, cutting into third-quarter sales. Sun closed down 5 3/8, to 22, on volume of 5.6 million shares.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Interest Rates Ascend In 2d Consecutive Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates moved sharply higher yesterday for the second consecutive trading session, with some market participants selling off long-term bonds.
Adding pressure to yesterday's selloff was a move by dealers in other fixed-income investments to hedge against losses by selling their Treasury securities. 
 Although the start of trading yesterday was mostly firmer after plunging in Friday's abbreviated session, Treasury securities soon caved in. The selling on Friday was caused by stronger-than-expected employment data, which heightened investors' fears of inflation.
Even a two-point decline yesterday in the Commodity Research Bureau index, another closely followed indicator of inflation price pressures, failed to subdue the selling pressures.
By late in the day yesterday, the price of the long-term bond was down 121/32 , to 866/32 , yielding 7.41 percent, up from 7.26 percent on Friday. The Treasury bellwether's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, is now at its highest point since Jan. 15, 1993, when it was 7.42 percent.
 
 
Seeking Short-Term Investments
 The discount rate on shorter-maturity bills and yields of intermediate-term notes were also higher, with the volatile stock market forcing some investors to seek the short end of the Treasury market for safety.
A two-year note traded yesterday at a price to yield 5.56 percent, up from 5.40 percent on Friday, while a five-year note rose to 6.62 percent from 6.43 percent. The yield of the 10-year note rose to 7.13 percent, from 6.93 percent on Friday.
Peter Hirsch, the head of the government trading desk at Salomon Brothers, said the bond market was "looking for a level of cheapness, or a price attractive enough to bring in buyers."
Like many other traders, he saw the recent selling as overdone, or beyond the fundamentals. He recalled when the yield on the long bond was as low as 5.78 percent in October 1993, "and that was also beyond market fundamentals." Mr. Hirsch said some of the selloff was by market participants who are younger and have never seen a bear market.
 
 
Derivative Market Hurt
 He also said that derivative investments -- which were not around 5 to 10 years ago -- were now being hurt by the rise in interest rates. As a result, dealers and fund managers have been forced to raise cash quickly by selling Treasury securities to cover redemptions.
The market is so sensitive to inflation that a forecast issued by Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company, an investment management firm, yesterday morning exacerbated anxieties. Mr. Kaufman said he saw short-term rates in the United States possibly rising to 7 percent and long-term Treasury yields trading in a range of 9 to 10 percent.
Even the monthly survey by the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, an inflation indicator that does not usually interest the market because four of its components are already known, provoked some selling because of inflation fears.
 
 
'Baby Out With the Bath Water'
 "We're now at the stage when are throwing the baby out with the bath water," said Gerald A. Guild, senior manager of fixed-income investments at Advest Inc.
"Psychologically, this is as bearish as I've seen it, but it's probably a good time to be investing in bonds," Mr. Guild said. "I'm almost convinced that we'll look back and say, 'Why didn't we buy at these levels based on a 5.50 percent real rate of return after inflation?' " He noted that the rate was substantially higher than the real rate of return at the peak of interest rates in 1981.
There were many explanations for yesterday's selloff, Mr. Guild said, citing a huge inventory of mortgage-backed securities as one. He also said that municipal bonds had forced dealers and managers to sell Treasury securities to hedge their positions.
There was some good news yesterday. The National Association of Purchasing Management price index fell to 64.2 percent from 67 percent. The fall in the association's vendor delivery index, to 55.1 percent from 58.8 percent, also gave the market some opportunities to buy.
Matthew Alexy, government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said: "With changes in the costs of financing, leveraged players and a lot of portfolio managers need to stay within certain constraints. As interest rates rise, their circumstances become worse as some products become more interest-rate sensitive."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	99.062	97.968	Discounted Rate	3.71%	4.02%	Coupon Yield	3.80%	4.16%	High Price	99.070	98.978	Discounted Rate	3.68%	4.00%	Coupon Yield	3.77%	4.14%	Low Price	99.062	97.963	Discounted Rate	3.71%	4.03%	Coupon Yield	3.80%	4.17%	Accepted at low price	66%	9%	Total applied for	$46,332,977	$40,993,033	Accepted	$12,685,557	$12,605,283	Noncompetitive	$1,416,312	$1,051,569

HEADLINE: No Details On Budget From Albany

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 4

 BODY:
Three days after they declared a budget deal, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the state's legislative leaders still had virtually no details to provide about it today, including which taxes they would cut, how they would divide aid to schools, which construction projects they would finance and how they would allocate money to local governments.
Although the leaders, particularly Mr. Cuomo, were eager to extol their budget, it became increasingly clear through the day that there was no budget to extol. Instead, there was just the skeleton of an agreement, with rough numbers penciled in as totals in a number of broad categories, like tax cuts, state aid to schools and spending on pet construction and maintenance projects. 
 The announcement of the agreement on Friday, the first day of the new fiscal year, dusted off an old ritual in Albany, where political reality and illusion can be difficult to separate. Last year, a minute into the new fiscal year, Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders emerged from a closed-door negotiating session to announce a budget deal and shake hands symbolically. But they provided no details and not until five days later did the budget pass.
About the only thing that was clear today was that the state would have more revenue available for the fiscal 1995 budget than was anticipated even a month ago. Mr. Cuomo and top lawmakers said the state's economy continued to improve beyond expectations in March, adding to the state's revenue base.
 
Conflicting Estimates
 But the Governor was reluctant to say how much new money there was, and lawmakers provided conflicting estimates of between $200 million and $500 million. The state Comptroller's office said official reports on tax collections would not be available for almost 10 days.
"What's happened is that the state has gotten stronger fiscally a lot faster than we expected," Mr. Cuomo said in his only explanation of the improved revenue outlook.
While Friday's agreement ostensibly shows how much additional money would be spent on tax cuts and certain programs, no one could say today exactly where the money would come from and whether total spending would exceed the $33.4 billion that Mr. Cuomo proposed in his budget in January.
If there was any consensus in the Capitol, as budget negotiations continued into the night, it was that the talks have taken on a certain mystical quality at this stage.
"How are they going to pay for all these things?" asked Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat. "That's the magic of the budget."
Senator Joseph L. Bruno, a Saratoga Republican, said, "You need to be a magician to understand these calculations."
Mr. Cuomo, whose audience includes both election-year voters and Wall Street bond raters, was eager to trumpet the budget as if it had been passed and signed.
 
Previously Late Budgets
 "This is an extraordinarily good budget," he said. "It is also neatly balanced, very neatly balanced and that perhaps I am even more happy about. It is definitely a renewal budget."
By declaring that the budget is all but done, even though major decisions are still being negotiated, Mr. Cuomo seemed to want to insulate himself from criticism that the budget is perpetually late.
The state has continued to operate as the negotiations progress because the Legislature last week passed the portion of the budget that pays for the operation of state agencies.
Under the agreement announced on Friday, the state is expected to cut taxes by about $400 million, a relatively small portion of the roughly $30 billion in taxes that the state expects to collect this year. Much of the tax cut is expected to affect business taxes, although there will also be a new tax credit for working poor families. The amounts of those tax cuts have yet to be determined.
Aid to schools would be increased by about $400 million, but there has been no decision on whether the Legislature will tinker with the complex formula that determines how much of the money goes to various school districts. Mr. Cuomo's proposed savings of $185 million from Medicaid programs will be substantially reduced, lawmakers said.
The Legislature is expected to get money for favored capital projects, including appropriations for new construction and improvements to minor league baseball stadiums in the upstate districts of Republican senators and money for repairing aging schools in New York City and its suburbs, where many Assembly Democrats live.

HEADLINE: 'Vinyl Wars' Divide a Hamlet;
Tappan Board's Ban on Siding Angers Some Homeowners

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TAPPAN, N.Y.

 BODY:
This aged hamlet, one of the cradles of the American Revolution, finds itself enduring another revolt, one that is also about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, though it seems at first to be mostly about vinyl siding.
A group of homeowners here and their sympathizers are rebelling against the rule of the local Historic Areas Board of Review, Tappan's version of a landmarks commission, which was formed three decades ago to preserve the hamlet's 46 historic dwellings, some almost 300 years old, as well as the hoary look of a village founded by farmers and mill hands. 
 The mutinous homeowners, many of whom are working folk themselves, want the right to replace rotting clapboards with vinyl siding, which they say is far less expensive than wood and does not need periodic painting. But the review board argues that synthetic products like vinyl spoil the gently seasoned look of the district and blot out historical details, ruining the buildings. It has barred homeowners from putting vinyl up and ordered the owner of a 1900-vintage house to strip off siding he had installed.
The argument has become known locally as the "Vinyl Wars." More than just a debate over vinyl siding, it pits the public's right to savor its history against the right of private property owners who find preservation an economic hardship.
Indeed, the working-class homeowners say they are being forced to spend cash they need for subsistence so wealthier people can enjoy the pristine look of a worker's village. "It's intruding into people's peace of mind and their bank accounts," said Mary Heaton, who owns a 100-year-old house on the district's edge.
Similar battles over the look, color and material of windows, doorways, and porches are being waged in many of the 1,800 landmark districts nationwide, said Katherine Raub Ridley, counsel to the Preservation League of New York State. In New York City, for example, the look and shape of windows has often been a point of contention. In the case of siding, those who favor vinyl have won a few victories -- in Fort Smith, Ark., and Salisbury, Md. -- and in other places have gained concessions for facades not visible from the street or for modern houses included within a district.
What galls the critics in Tappan is that the seven-member review board has extended its ban on vinyl siding to fairly contemporary houses. Moreover, the critics say, none of the current board members live within the 17-block-long historic district, choosing the larger homes on the village's periphery, yet imposing their tastes on district homeowners.
Though both sides display the genuine affection of fellow villagers toward each other, the harsher critics have taken to calling the board members "elitists" and "bullies."
"This is taxation without representation," said Joseph Fitzpatrick, a retired telephone company splicer. His 60-year-old home stands with its sky-blue insulation exposed to the world because he is fighting an order to cover it with clapboard.
 
How It Really Looked
 But Danforth Toan, a retired architect who has been on the board since its creation, says people like himself, even if they live outside the district, are taking the longer view. These Tappan residents want to retain the genuine wood and gingerbread carving, want to keep out jarring embellishments like above-ground swimming pools, so that visitors a century from now can say: "That's old; that's what it really looked like."
"We think of ourselves as caretakers of a historical tradition that far outweighs the momentary problems as they arise for people who are just passing through," Mr. Toan said.
The rangy, goateed Mr. Toan, who is 75 years old, has become the central figure of the debate.
"I liken Dan Toan to an entrenched congressional committee chairman with many years of tenure who runs his committee with an iron hand," said Reginald Thayer, a leader of the rebel band, which calls itself Concerned Orangetown Residents after the larger township.
Before he retired, Mr. Toan, a genial, cultured man, worked as an architect, designing library buildings at Brown and Columbia Universities. In his youth he was a maverick, and he came to Rockland County about 45 years ago with the idea of buying land for a cooperative community of houses for 32 Columbia students, who would share a tennis court, swimming pool and market.
 
From Communist to Capitalist
 Mr. Toan realized that vision in the Tappan neighborhood known as Hickory Hill, but time has made him a village elder and in the vinyl revolution he has been depicted as something of a Tory, fighting progress and the will of the people.
"They think of us as elitist capitalists," Mr. Toan said. "When we were first building here they thought of us as Communists."
Tappan, which is on the northern New Jersey border and a few miles south of Nyack, is proud of its role in the American Revolution, however minor.
Here stands the DeClark-DeWint house, a stone cottage where George Washington had one of his headquarters. And here, still operating as a tavern, is the Old '76 House, where the British spy John Andre was confined before his execution for plotting the surrender of West Point with Benedict Arnold.
The cluster of small, boxy wooden buildings on Tappan's Main Street, with their sagging wooden porches and decorative trim, look much the way they did in 19th-century drawings. Beyond Main Street, however, they are laced among an eclectic mix of 90 or so more modern buildings, even an occasional split-level. These were included in the historic district as a way of protecting what Mr. Toan calls the "townscape" -- the look of an old village.
Mr. Toan essentially wrote the preservation law -- which also came to cover a second historical area in the adjacent hamlet of Palisades -- and his opponents credit him with protecting Tappan's historical integrity. But they also say that he is interpreting his own law arbitrarily.
Mr. Fitzpatrick and his wife, Dorothy, raised nine children in a two-bedroom cape that was built in 1936 and is a stone's throw from the Washington headquarters, built in 1700. When water damaged the shingles covering their outside walls last year, the Fitzpatricks decided to put up vinyl siding. Vinyl, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, cost $8,000, compared with $13,000 for cedar clapboard and would be easier for Mr. Fitzpatrick to maintain.
Contractors had completed installing the insulation and were about to cover it with vinyl siding when members of the review board stopped the work in January. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who lives on a $1,061 monthly pension plus Social Security, is now asking the local zoning board to repeal the order.
Mr. Toan argues that even with houses only 50 or 60 years old it is important to keep the village look harmonious because even newer houses have historical details and, over time, "distinctions tend to mellow." Mr. Toan also contends that preserving the hamlet's overall historical flavor will enhance the values of all homes, compensating owners for the extra costs of installing clapboard.
The Concerned Orangetown Residents group is trying to remove Mr. Toan from the board and fill two other vacancies with sympathetic district residents. In an effort to bridge the gap, Mr. Toan has suggested that the town create a fund to help owners who find landmark obligations a hardship.
Once, Mr. Toan said, there was a consensus that Tappan's history should be preserved.
"It becomes the collective memory of the community," he said. "Schoolchildren come here to look at the church, the graveyard and the trees and the streams that attracted the original settlers."
"What we're seeing here is the deterioration of that consensus," he said. "The historical society people have aged, and young people are not as interested."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Investors Worried Over Fed Bring On an Attack of Jitters

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The futures markets took a nervous ride yesterday as commodity-fund investors, shaken by Government forecasts of ample crops, bailed out of some agricultural commodities but bought oil futures aggressively.
"Everything is going crazy," said Hans Kashyap, president of Analytics Research Corporation. "Everywhere you look in the commodities area, you see sharply lower prices. Soybeans, lumber, silver, orange juice, coffee, cocoa are down." 
 A few markets posted gains -- notably crude oil, wheat and livestock. But in general futures markets were hit by selling from professional funds that had bet heavily in recent sessions and either took profits or cut their losses.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 futures, a key inflation indicator, dropped to a two-month low of 225.38.
"This is not good way to start off April," said Jeff Wilson, editor of the market-watching Brock Report.
 
 
Fears of Federal Reserve
 Mr. Wilson said yesterday's selling reflected continuing jitters from last week as stock and bond prices plunged on fears of a new round of credit tightening by the Federal Reserve.
"Most of today's weakness is strictly a preservation of capital by major commodity funds," he said. "The markets are too volatile right now."
Soybeans and silver, two speculative favorites, led the selling.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, July soybeans closed down the daily allowable 30-cent-a-bushel limit at $6.53 1/2 following a bearish 1994 plantings estimate by the Government on Thursday. Seedings are expected to be up 3 percent, to 61 million acres.
Silver led a selloff in precious metals as financial market worries, falling commodity prices and rising interest rates spurred liquidation by hedge funds. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, May silver closed 19.3 cents lower at $5.592 an ounce after hitting $5.82, a life of contract high, early. June gold ended $5.60 lower at $388.70 an ounce. And July platinum fell $8.40, to $418.50 an ounce, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 
 
Energy Futures Driven Up
 "I don't think the metals were ever a flight to safety," said a Paine Webber analyst, Bernard Savaiko, who said hedge funds and other investors hit by the sagging stock market had tended to favor cash during the current period of volatility.
Meanwhile, many commodity fund investors turned to crude oil. With fundamentals bearish after last week's failure by OPEC to cut production, the professionals decided that a contrarian stand was needed and flocked in, driving energy futures higher.
May crude oil ended $1 higher, up 7 percent and at a two-month high of $15.79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
"I think the funds have turned bullish on oil," said Morris Greenberg, oil analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York.

HEADLINE: Montreal Journal;
Quebec Bets on Subsidized Milk, Mother's Kind

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
"It's great news," Josee Paradis said, rocking her 6-week-old son, Brock, in her arms in her sparsely furnished basement apartment in an industrial suburb of Montreal.
Ms. Paradis, a 19-year-old former secretarial student, was praising a decision by Quebec's provincial government to raise the subsidy for breast-feeding from $15 to about $37.50 a month under a new program to encourage low-income women to nurse their infants. 
 For Ms. Paradis and Brock's father, Rick Flood, 23, who pay $450 a month in rent, the $37.50 subsidy was a big factor in the decision to breast-feed Brock. It represents nearly 5 percent of their monthly expenditures.
"It will be very handy for us, that's for sure," said Mr. Flood, who is unemployed but hopes to get a job as a window-washer.
Ms. Paradis added, "They say it's better for the baby."
There is no doubt that the government of Quebec thinks breast-feeding is better. "Mother's milk is the food best adapted to the newborn's nutritional needs," said Violette Trepanier, Minister of Income Security, who introduced the new benefits on March 1.
In a sharp departure from the traditional role of government, Quebec pays mothers to nurse their infants. Ms. Trepanier says it does so to further both public health and budgetary goals. Since breast-fed babies tend to be healthier babies, she says, encouraging nursing could ultimately save the publicly financed health care system millions of dollars a year.
Quebec has paid supplements to nursing mothers and subsidized the cost of some infant formula for the last quarter-century. What is new -- and highly appreciated by nursing mothers on low incomes -- is the policy shift in favor of breast milk. When the cash incentive for breast-feeding rose to $37.50 a month, the subsidy for formula was reduced.
For the 7,000 women in Quebec on public assistance who have infants up to six months old, the ministry had previously paid 100 percent of the cost of soy-based formula. That product will no longer be subsidized, except for children with lactose intolerance, but the province covers about 70 percent of the cost of milk-based formula concentrate by issuing a voucher similar to a food stamp.
The program will still cost the provincial government $3.8 million a year, since the reduction in subsidies for formula will finance the higher nursing allowances. To prevent abuses, the ministry requires that a new mother present an affidavit from her doctor to the local office of the Income Security Ministry that confirms that she is nursing.
The effort is being watched in other Canadian provinces and in the United States, which also have assistance programs for low-income mothers and try to encourage breast-feeding, though they stop short of the incentives offered by Quebec.
Statistics show that a far smaller proportion of women with low incomes breast-feed their infants than women with higher incomes, both in Canada and the United States.
The Quebec government estimates that 60 percent of the province's mothers nurse their infants in the first six months of life, compared with 9 percent of mothers on public assistance. The latter estimate is based on the proportion of women who take the breast-feeding allowance.
In the United States, an estimated three-quarters of middle- and upper-income women nurse their infants, compared with less than one-quarter of the women in the Agriculture Department's special supplemental food program for women, infants and children. The program provides Federal grants to states to help low-income families meet their nutritional needs.
Dr. Ruth A. Lawrence, director of the Breast-Feeding and Human Lactation Center at the University of Rochester, praised the Quebec program. She said she and other advocates in the United States have been urging the Agriculture Department that "they, too, need to reward mothers for doing this special thing for their infants."
Under strong Congressional pressure, the Agriculture Department has recently provided extra food vouchers to nursing mothers in the supplemental nutrition program and allowed them to stay on the program longer -- one year instead of six months.
There is no longer any dissent, even from the formula makers, that breast milk is superior to any other infant food.
The companies are careful to describe formula as a supplement or an alternative to breast milk, and all emphasize that they encourage mothers to take the advice of health professionals.
"Infant formula is appropriate for mothers who for whatever reasons choose not to breast-feed," said Marianne King-Wilson, Nestle Canada's director of corporate affairs.
Marie Alta Dorce, 31, who moved to Canada in 1986 from Haiti and now lives in northern Montreal, is breast-feeding her 10-week-old son, Andy. A single mother, she has studied to be a secretary, but is out of work.
She is thankful for the extra money, though she says that it barely covers the cost of the nutritious food she needs -- expensive milk and eggs, yogurt, oranges -- to sustain her during her nursing period. But with a nod to her sleeping son, she remarked, "If the baby is in good form, the mother will be in good form."

HEADLINE: A 7th Month of Growth Found in Manufacturing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
American manufacturing expanded for the seventh straight month in March, although the rate of growth slowed from the month before, a trade group of corporate purchasing managers said yesterday.
The monthly assessment by the National Association of Purchasing Management substantiated other evidence that the United States economy is strengthening. The purchasing managers' survey is widely followed in assessing the state of the economy's health because it offers some of the freshest information. 
 The group said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 56.7 percent, from 56.6 percent in February. A reading of more than 50 percent indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding, a reading of less than 50 indicates it is shrinking.
"We had a very strong month of production in March," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business community and purchasing director at Pitney Bowes Inc. New orders to manufacturers continued to expand, he added "but the rate of growth seems to be leveling off in new orders and backlog of orders."
 
14 of 20 Industries Gain
 The group said 14 of 20 industries surveyed reported an improvement in March as many businesses recovered from disruptions caused by a harsh winter and the California earthquake.
Prices, a key indicator of inflation, continued to rise in March, but at a more subdued rate than in February. The association's price index fell to 64.2 percent in March, from 67 percent in February.
"The rate of growth that we had over the fourth quarter and the first month in this quarter just can't be sustained," Mr. Bretz said. He added that as the pace of the recovery slowed a decline in demand for goods should ease upward pressure on prices.
 
Scrap Steel Prices Decline
 He noted that prices for scrap steel, a bellwether commodity, had begun to decline and said that future increases in steel imports should further ease steel prices.
But he said he expected price increases in some types of paper and chemicals and in plastics.
The purchasing managers' report also said that new orders to manufacturers continued to grow at about the same high rate as in February, that new export orders continued to rise in March, but at a significantly lower rate than in February, and that imports grew for the fifth straight month, but at a slightly slower pace than in February.
Industries reporting the most improvement were leather, plastics and rubber, apparel, transportation equipment, electronic components and equipment, fabricated metals and industrial and commercial equipment and computers.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Bar Extra Fees for Dumping of Out-of-State Waste

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that states may not impose extra fees for dumping waste from another state.
The 7-to-2 decision overturned an Oregon surcharge on the disposal of solid waste generated beyond Oregon's borders. Under the 1989 law, the fee for placing out-of-state waste in an Oregon landfill is $3.10 a ton, as against 85 cents for waste generated within Oregon. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the surcharge last year. 
 The ruling today was the latest of several Supreme Court decisions to reject protectionist efforts by a growing number of states to restrict the flow of trash and hazardous waste.
The decision, written by Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, was based on the Constitution's commerce clause, which prohibits the states from erecting economic barriers against interstate commerce.
 
Handling Costs Cited
 "Discrimination simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter," Justice Thomas said. "If a restriction on commerce is discriminatory, it is virtually per se invalid."
The decision, Oregon Waste Systems v. Department of Environmental Qualify, No. 93-70, left open the prospect that a state could justify a surcharge if the costs of handling out-of-state waste were actually higher. But the possibility of a successful defense appeared remote.
Oregon tried to provide an economic justification for the surcharge, calling it a compensatory tax intended to force shippers of out-of-state waste to pay their "fair share" of costs that in-state shippers pay through the state income tax and other taxes. The Court rejected this explanation. Justice Thomas noted in his opinion that the state had neither explained how it set the surcharge at $2.25 per ton nor claimed that the in-state shippers pay the equivalent of the surcharge through their general taxes.
The majority opinion was joined by Associate Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented in an opinion that Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun also signed.
 
Rehnquist Applauds Oregon
 Chief Justice Rehnquist said "Oregon should be applauded" for taking a comprehensive approach to its solid-waste disposal problem. "The Court today leaves states with only two options," the opinion said: "become a dumper and ship as much waste as possible to a less populated state, or become a dumpee, and stoically accept waste from more densely populated states."
"I see nothing in the commerce clause that compels less densely populated states to serve as the low-cost dumping grounds for their neighbors," the Chief Justice concluded.
According to a brief filed by the National Solid Wastes Management Association, an industry group, most states both import some waste and export some. Of the 420 million tons of solid and hazardous waste generated each year, some 20 million tons move across state lines for disposal.
Fourteen states filed a brief telling the Court that they had adopted policies similar to Oregon's or were considering doing so. According to this brief, 18 states -- none in the New York metropolitan area -- currently restrict the movement of solid or hazardous waste across state or county lines.
Cases dealing with waste disposal have become staples of the Supreme Court's docket, reflecting the economic and political stakes that are now attached to the issue. The Court is expected to rule shortly in two other cases. One, C. & A. Carbone v. Clarkstown, N.Y., No. 92-1402, reflects the fact that waste can be an economic asset as well as a burden.
 
Challenge to Ordinance
 The case is a challenge brought under the commerce clause to an ordinance that requires all trash generated in the town to be taken to a designated facility for sorting rather than shipped elsewhere. The other case, Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, No. 92-1639, involves Federal regulation of the ash created from municipal waste in an incinerator designed to produce steam.
There were also these developments at the Court today:
 
Airline Suits
 The High Court agreed to review a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court that permitted members of the American Airlines frequent flyer program to sue the airline for consumer fraud for imposing new conditions on accumulating mileage credits for free flights.
American Airlines appealed the ruling with the support of other commercial airlines, several of which are facing similar lawsuits. The question for the court is whether consumer suits of this sort can be brought under state law, or whether all such suits are pre-empted by a Federal law, the Airline Deregulaton Act of 1978, which governs all regulations "relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier."
The Supreme Court in the past has interpreted the Federal law broadly to displace state regulation. The Justices ruled two years ago, in Morales v. T.W.A., that states could not regulate deceptive advertising of airfares. But earlier this year, the Court declined to review a Federal appeals court ruling that permitted an airline passenger who had been bumped from an overbooked flight to sue for damages under state law.
The airline industry takes the pre-emption question very seriously, because the practical issue is whether airlines are answerable to one Federal law or to the laws of the 50 states. Class-action lawsuits now pending under various state laws over cancellation penalties, as well as over frequent flyer programs, potentially involve tens of millions of plaintiffs. The suit involved in this case, American Airlines v. Wolens, No. 93-1286, has not yet gone to trial.
In finding that the Supreme Court's 1992 decision did not apply to this case, the Illinois Supreme Court held that frequent flyer programs had only a tangential relationship to airline "rates, routes and services," areas of operations that are pre-empted by the Federal law. The state court observed that airlines had operated for many years before American Airlines established the first frequent flyer program in 1981.
But the Air Transport Association, an industry group that filed a brief urging the Court to hear the case, said the programs are important marketing tools that have a substantial impact on fares and services.
 
Company Relocations
 The Court agreed to decide the validity of the National Labor Relations Board's policy governing an employer's duty to bargain with its unions over the decision to relocate the company's operations.
The subject has been a contentious one for years, with the labor board issuing a series of conflicting rulings. This case, Dubuque Packing Company v. N.L.R.B., No. 93-1103, concerns the latest policy, a 1991 ruling that provides that management is generally required to bargain over a relocation that does not reflect a basic change in the nature of the business.
The policy was upheld last year by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Associate Justice Ginsburg, who sat on that three-judge panel, is not participating in the case at the Supreme Court level.
 
Veterans' Suits
 Accepting an appeal from the Federal Government, the Court agreed to review a decision that potentially makes the Department of Veterans Affairs financially liable whenever treatment at a veterans' hospital results in a poor medical outcome, regardless of whether the treatment was faulty.
The case, Brown v. Gardner, No. 93-1128, is an appeal from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court last year rejected a longstanding interpretation of a 1924 law providing disability compensation to veterans injured "as the result of" treatment in a veterans' hospital. For nearly 70 years, the Government had interpreted the law as applying only to negligent treatment, but the appeals court found that there was no such limitation in the plain language of the law. The Government is estimating that the ruling, if not overturned, will cost $1 billion over the next five years.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Wall St. dusts off an old theme: The bear brings opportunity.

BYLINE: By Joshua Mills 

 BODY:
FOR people in the business of selling stocks, recent days have not been a bear market, oh no. Sure, the hiccup in the long bull market has turned into a prolonged coughing fit, but many brokers prefer to see this as "an opportunity market," full of bargains for their clients.
As the Dow Jones industrial average slid 42.61 points yesterday, putting its decline from its late-January peak at almost 10 percent, a number of brokers and money managers said they were busy buying shares for their clients. 
 "We've seen people dumping stocks in an almost irrational fashion, but we recommended buying today," said Alfred Goldman, the market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "Chrysler and General Motors and Home Depot all look like good value."
He continued: "Our advice to clients has been: when value shows up, buy it. Invest in stocks -- and also in patience."
Michael Metz, the chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company in New York, said that while he remained bearish over all, "food and drug stocks are down to prices where I'd begin buying, for long-term investment."
"Intel is really one of the more attractive stocks right now," he added. "So is Motorola." So are life insurance and bank stocks, he said.
But Mr. Metz disputed Mr. Goldman's optimism on the auto makers. "I think we've seen the peak on them, for all consumer durable goods, housing, too," he said.
In tandem with declining share prices in recent days, brokers' cliches have been raining down, too: "They're only losses if you sell"; "this looks like a normal correction"; "buy into weakness."
If all this sounds like tough going as the Dow slides, does it make any less sense than telling investors, as a bull market thunders along to new highs: "Buy now. Prices have never been higher."
Thomas V. Reilly, the chief investment officer at the Putnam Group's value equity group in Boston, said yesterday's continued slide was no surprise, given the turmoil in the bond market. His strategy in recent years, he said, has been to invest in cyclical stocks that would rise as the economy gathered strength.
And while, like Mr. Metz, he thinks the housing market has topped out, he said other sectors still held promise. Mr. Reilly said he was optimistic about the prospects for Xerox, ITT, chemical companies like Du Pont and Dow Chemical, and also Alcoa, the aluminum producer.
"There's been such broad selling over the last six or seven trading days that we've been in buying every day," he said.
 So has Jeffrey Vinik, who manages Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, the country's largest mutual fund with $34 billion under management. "I've been building up positions in stocks I like for the long term," he said.
Mr. Vinik said he had been buying financial companies like Fannie Mae and General Re; Goodyear Tire, and also Caterpillar and CSX. Highly optimistic about technology, he said he had not bought much in recent days because Magellan already had strong positions in that sector.
"I don't know what the market will do tomorrow or next week, but when I can buy the stocks I feel best about in the long term at 20 percent discount to where they were a couple of months ago, I do," Mr. Vinik said.
He noted, for example, that after building up a substantial position in G.M., Ford and Chrysler, he had sold part of his holdings during the winter. "Now I'm buying them back," he said, because they have fallen an average of 15 percent from their midwinter peaks.

HEADLINE: Employees' Next Concern: Possible Cuts in Work Force

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BETHPAGE, L.I., April 4

 BODY:
With the Grumman Corporation's announcement this morning that it had agreed to a takeover by the Northrop Corporation, the big question for Grumman employees was how the merger would affect their jobs.
"On the one hand, I'm glad the guessing game is over," said Robert McHugh, a computer programmer. "It makes the few shares of Grumman stock I own worth a lot more, but that won't do me any good if I lose my job when the dust settles." 
 Grumman has already cut its local work force to fewer than 9,000 employees, from more than 23,000 in 1987. The most recent layoffs were announced in mid-February when 1,300 workers were told that the 6,000-acre Calverton operation, where Grumman built and tested four types of Navy aircraft, would be closed.
 
 
No More Planes From L.I.
 The move, a direct result of cutbacks in Pentagon orders, meant the end of airplane manufacturing on Long Island, long considered a cradle of aviation in the United States.
Local economists said they welcomed Northrop's acquisition of Grumman, saying the merger might strengthen Grumman's role in building airplanes.
"I think the question is jobs and whether Grumman would fare better under Northrop or Martin Marietta," Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Chemical Bank, said. "And I think Grumman employees may do best with Northrop."
"Northrop is in the airplane business to some extent, while Martin Marietta is not," Mr. Kellner said. "The hope is that some of Northrop's business in that area can be transferred to Grumman.
"Northrop does make frames for the 747 and has a fighter plane in production as well, and Grumman could adapt to Northrop's needs."
Mr. Kellner said local economists and public officials feared that Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., which is a much larger corporation than Northrop, with little interest in the airplane construction business, might close most or all of Grumman's operation on Long Island and move it to Maryland or elsewhere in the country.
 
 
Company to Change Name
 Robert Harwood, a spokesman for Grumman, said shareholders would have until April 15 to tender their shares to Northrop. The $2 billion deal could be completed by mid-May.
He said Northrop, the Los Angeles-based builder of the B-2 bomber, had indicated that it would change its name to the Northrop Grumman Corporation, and consider putting the headquarters for its military electronics business on Long Island.
Mr. Harwood said Grumman retirees should not be concerned about losing any of their benefits. But he could give no such assurance on job security in the merged company.
"We have to wait and see what's going to happen as the companies are combined and where everything goes," he said. "Remember, this is still the defense business, and there's still a long way to go before the defense budget turns around. And until that time, you're going to see decreasing employment in this industry."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Little Change Despite Jump in U.S. Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar finished yesterday with little change against most major currencies after an erratic trading session, as concerns about slumping stock and bond prices offset renewed optimism about the American economy.
Traders said that despite rising interest rates yesterday, the dollar failed to follow up on its gains on Friday, when rates also climbed sharply. They said the sharp selloff in the stock market held the dollar down. 
 "The U.S. financial markets are in terrible shape," said Christopher Bourdain, a trader at Credit Suisse. "What are people going to buy with their dollars?"
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6975 German marks, little changed from 1.6970 marks on Friday. It also fell to 103.15 Japanese yen from 103.60 yen. Trading was less active than usual because London, the world's biggest foreign-exchange center, was closed in observance of Easter Monday.
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond jumped to 7.41 percent yesterday on speculation that the strong March employment report that was released on Friday pointed to rising inflation rates. On Friday, the 30-year bond jumped to 7.26 percent from 7.08 percent in thin trading in reaction to the employment report.
Yesterday, stocks tumbled amid concern that rising interest rates would stifle the economic recovery.
Declines in stocks and bonds have kept the dollar from following interest rates higher in the last two months. Before the dollar's two-pfennig rally against the mark on Friday, the dollar had fallen almost 4 percent against the mark since Jan. 1. Higher rates usually make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
"Currency traders are obsessed with the stock market right now," said Lynn Tierney, vice president at Shawmut Bank of Boston. "It's a psychological thing, mostly."
Concern that Prime Minister John Major of Britain might lose office soon helped the dollar rise to a seven-week high against the pound. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.4670, down from $1.4740 on Friday.
Traders sold pounds after The Sunday Times of London reported that only 40 percent of legislators in the ruling Conservative Party believe that Mr. Major will lead the party into the next general election.
The Canadian dollar also fell, tumbling to a seven-year low amid speculation that interest rates in the United States would rise faster than Canadian rates in coming weeks. The Canadian dollar fell as low as 71.48 United States cents, down from 72.02 cents on Friday. It rose from its lows after the Bank of Canada bought the currency to stem the slide, traders said.
The Canadian dollar is "on its way to 65 cents," said Al Friedberg, president of Friedberg Mercantile Group, a Toronto currency trading fund.

HEADLINE: Some Optimism in Japan

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 4

 BODY:
Bank of Japan officials from various regions reported brighter prospects today for a long-awaited recovery in the Japanese economy.
The regional managers reported at their quarterly meeting that business executives appeared to be gaining confidence. 
 Bright spots are particularly evident in Osaka and neighboring cities in western Japan, where electronics giants like Matsushita Electric Industrial are based, the manager of the Osaka region, Tatsuya Tamura, said.
Industrial production rose in central Japan in the January-March period and was likely to continue upward in the April-June period, Takahiro Kawase, branch manager for the central Nagoya region, said.
Auto makers are increasing their shipments to the United States, Mr. Kawase said, adding, "The economy seems to have stopped worsening."
Household demand for washing machines, refrigerators and personal computers and facsimile machines has emerged as consumers seek replacements for old equipment and are enticed by lower prices.

HEADLINE: Quest for Evolutionary Meaning In the Persistence of Suicide

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
CONSIDERED on its face, suicide seems to flout the laws of nature, slashing through the sturdy instinct that wills all beings to fight for their lives until they can fight no longer.
Yet to some evolutionary geneticists, suicide cannot be entirely explained as a violent aberration or a human pathology lying outside the ebbs and pulls of natural selection and adaptation. These researchers note that suicide, for all its private, tangled sorrows, is surprisingly common in most countries, accounting on average for nearly 1 percent of all deaths. And when the number of serious suicide attempts is taken into account, the prevalence of the behavior jumps considerably. 
 That sort of incidence, the evolutionary geneticists say, is simply too great to be accounted for by standard explanations like social malaise or random cases of psychiatric disease.
Instead, the scientists suggest that the persistence of suicide at a fairly high rate across most cultures suggests an underlying evolutionary component, a possible Darwinian rationale for an act that too often appears starkly irrational. They propose that the tendency toward suicide could be a concomitant of a trait or group of traits that at some point in evolutionary history conferred benefits on those who bore it.
In other words, suicide may not be a freak event, or a complete breakdown of the natural order of things, but a behavior that by the sometimes cruel logic of natural selection, may make enough sense to maintain at a certain low but significant level.
"Any time you have a behavioral system that is relatively common and strongly persistent, it raises the question of whether the system is selected for," said Dr. Daniel Wilson, a clinical psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and an anthropologist at the University of Cambridge in England. "Suicidal behaviors are relatively stable across cultural lines."
He emphasized that nobody argues that there is a single gene for suicide, or that suicide or mental illness should be thought of as good. But he and others said there may be plausible evolutionary explanations for at least some self-destructive acts.
What is more, the tendency to commit or try suicide often runs in families, suggesting that a predisposition toward self-murder is partly inherited. And while suicide occurs in nearly all countries, it is far more common among some ethnic groups.
The Hungarians and the Finns, for example, suffer from suicide rates two to three times those in the United States and most of Europe. Significantly, the elevated incidence holds true not only in those nations, where economic or social conditions could be responsible, but also for Finns and Hungarians who emigrated to other countries, again hinting at a biological substrate.
 
The Theories
Martyrdom Or Depression?
 In trying to fathom what that substrate might be, researchers propose that the impulse to kill oneself may be an expression of an instinct toward self-sacrifice for the good of surviving relatives, either because those relatives will be rescued from their own death, or because they will benefit richly from the resources that are thus freed up. The survivors will in turn pass on the sacrificial victim's genes.
"In the jungle, a hominid might well have enhanced his own genetic survival by sacrificing himself to a leopard, if that thereby saved six of his brothers and sisters," Dr. Wilson said. But because humans live in complex social groups, such an impulse toward martyrdom might on occasion show itself in complex, even distorted forms, tugging miserably at the psyches of even those who have no families to benefit from their deaths and to assure that their genetic legacies survive.
Other evolutionary biologists suggest that suicide may not be an inheritable behavior in itself but is simply the most tragic outcome of another trait that may be selected for -- the tendency toward depression. Some Darwinian-minded theorists say that extremely bleak moods are themselves too common to be the result of pathology alone. They propose that bouts of depression may be useful, forcing people into a kind of emotional hibernation and giving them time to ponder their mistakes.
But such a strategy, if sustained too long or repeated too often, becomes maladaptive and even fatal, the researchers emphasized, showing itself as the harrowing disease called major depression.
Some researchers, reasoning that human beings invent few traits but instead merely display intricate versions of behaviors seen elsewhere in the animal kingdom, have looked to other species for insights into the genesis of depression and suicide. The exercise is fraught with pitfalls.
Nonhuman animals obviously do not leave behind anything as clear as a note, nor are they likely to have sufficient awareness to do something as deliberate as jump off a cliff. But biologists have identified numerous examples of creatures that sacrifice themselves for their kin, from termites that explode their guts, releasing the slimy, foul contents over enemies that threaten their nest, to rodents that deliberately starve themselves to death rather than risk spreading an infection to others in their burrow.
 
Prozac for Monkeys
 More compellingly, scientists recently have determined that many species of nonhuman primates will suffer serious depression when stressed. And upon falling into an episode of melancholy, the afflicted monkeys may engage in all sorts of life-threatening activities -- like refusing food until they die of malnutrition, or swinging from dangerous tree limbs that no sane monkey would go near -- and sometimes perishing in the exercise. So similar is monkey depression to human depression, some scientists say, that the symptoms of melancholy dissipate when the primates are given antidepressants like Prozac.
Evolutionary geneticists admit they approach this theoretical terrain with enormous trepidation, for they are well aware of how insensitive or glib they can appear by ascribing suicide and depression to the handiwork of natural selection. But they hope that by exploring this unorthodox line of reasoning, they can come up with new insights into the kinds of behavioral changes that precede a suicide attempt, or any common features that may typify a person at risk for extreme mental illness, or suicide.
"I've had people get very angry at me because they think I'm trying to say that depression is good for you," said Dr. Randolph M. Nesse, a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan who has explored the evolutionary basis of depression and anxiety. "No matter how many caveats I bring up, no matter how cautiously I phrase my work," he added, people do not want to hear depression talked about in anything other than the most strongly condemnatory terms.
 
The Arguments
When Is Death Deliberate?
 Researchers know too well how easily a Darwinian explanation for complex behaviors can be overdone and oversimplified. Certainly, the affairs of animals much simpler than people have been misinterpreted in the past. For example, the idea of suicide in nonhuman species invariably raises the famed example of lemmings, rodents that were long thought by scientists and the public to kill themselves en masse by running into the sea, as though cued by a group alarm clock indicating that today is a good day to die.
But researchers have learned that the tale of the suicidal lemming is false. The tawny-furred rodents will die by the group, but that, it turns out, is a result of an error in judgment. Lemmings are the locusts of mammals, and they will strip a habitat bare. Then, they begin migrating forward to find a new feeding ground, swarming over boulders, around trees, whatever stands in their way. If they run into a body of water, they try to swim across.
"That's fine if it's a pond or a stream," said Dr. Paul W. Sherman, a behavioral ecologist at Cornell University. "But if they happen to hit a lake or an the ocean, well, they discover too late that they just can't make it."
Animal behaviorists often argue fiercely over whether a death they observe in the wilderness is deliberate or accidental. Dr. Raymond J. O'Connor, a professor of wildlife at the University of Maine in Orono, has developed models predicting that under certain circumstances, a hatchling bird in a multichick brood would do better to allow itself to be killed by its siblings than to fight back.
For example, he proposes, a mother crested penguin always lays two eggs a season, one small, one large. Given the harshness of her arctic surroundings, she can only rear one bird to independence, and usually that lucky penguin will come from the large egg. But she lays a double dose just in case the big egg is preyed on.
Dr. O'Connor suggests that should the big and little eggs both end up hatching, the smaller offspring might do better to allow itself to be killed by its bigger sibling without putting up a fuss: to essentially throw itself on its sibling's sword.
"There are some circumstances where it may pay to acquiesce in being killed, in committing suicide," he said, "to allow the genes that it shares with its sibling to progress faster."
Yet while researchers have observed that the little penguins do appear to die off in these encounters with few feathers ruffled, Dr. Douglas W. Mock, a professor of zoology at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, does not believe the smaller contender is going gentle into that good night.
"If I'm in a lifeboat, and the only other person on it is Mike Tyson, am I going to fight him for what little food we have left?" he said. "Or am I going to lay low and look for a chance to push him overboard, or pray that he gets zapped by lightning?"
 
Defining Suicide
 In general, scientists will call a death a suicide only when the animal has much to gain and little to lose, reproductively speaking, from the gesture. Dr. Robert Trivers of the University of California at Santa Cruz cited the example of cryptically colored butterflies that escape being eaten by blending into their surroundings. Once the adults are past their reproductive time, he said, they become a risk to their surviving offspring, for the simple reason that if they are discovered by a bird, the bird will gain clues from the butterfly to discriminate prey from background; and thereafter, the younger butterflies will also be in danger.
As it happens, the post-fertile adults usually drop to the groundcover and begin beating their wings rapidly until they die of exhaustion. "It's obliterating itself before it can be caught," he said.
Other examples of self-sacrifice abound. In some gall midges, tiny flylike insects, a mother will offer up her body as a meal to her offspring. Among naked mole rats, hairless and blind rodents that live underground and are almost as closely related to one another as are bees in a hive, an animal that is infested with parasites knows what it must do: go off to the communal toilet area of the intricate burrow and remain there until it dies.
"It never comes out, and you can't force-feed it," said Dr. Sherman, who has long studied the creatures. "It can't risk infecting the whole colony."
In applying the idea of self-sacrifice for the good of one's kith and kin to human beings, scientists cite obvious examples: mothers who will gladly die to save their children, war heroes who will go down in flames for their brethren, or even the recent spate of so-called rational suicides, in which elderly or terminally ill patients request that they be allowed to die quickly to avoid being a drain on their families. Researchers are much more reluctant to use such reasoning to justify the behavior of suicidal patients who very often are mentally ill, lonely and alienated from those who care about them.
But psychiatrists have observed that people who are contemplating suicide frequently think of it in extravagantly selfless terms, as the option that would be best for the suicide's family and friends.
"If you talk to people immediately after they made a serious suicide attempt, they'll have a very altruistic explanation for what they did," said Dr. David C. Clark, director of the Center for Suicide Research and Prevention at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. "They believed it was the wise, clever and thoughtful thing to do."
 
The Science
Personality Or Biochemistry?
 Suicide experts have long known that the great majority of people who kill themselves suffer from a psychiatric illness, most often depression or manic-depression. Such conditions are characterized by dramatic shifts in brain chemistry, particularly a drop in neurotransmitters like norepinephrine or serotonin, the molecules that allow nerve cells to communicate and that help modulate emotions and aggression.
Scientists studying nonhuman primates say they have witnessed many of the symptoms of serious depression in their subjects, including an apparent disregard for self-preservation. Jane Goodall, the renowned watcher of chimpanzees, once observed a 7 1/2-year-old male chimp experience such a profound despair after the death of his mother that he refused to leave her corpse even to eat.
"He slowly withered away, laid down and died," said Dr. Richard Wrangham of Harvard University, who worked with Dr. Goodall. "Jane talks about this as dying of a broken heart, and that seems like a perfectly good interpretation."
Others have studied the biochemistry that accompanies low mood in monkeys, and have found it to be a reasonable analogue of human depression. Dr. Stephen J. Suomi, chief of the laboratory of comparative ethology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., has been studying rhesus monkeys living in free-ranging colonies. He has learned that about 20 percent of the monkeys are predisposed to becoming seriously depressed -- roughly the same as the human lifetime risk of the disorder -- when they lose a relative or close partner, or suffer a drop in social status.
 
Humanlike Changes
 Significantly, the depressed monkeys show some of the same changes in brain chemistry that neurophysiologists have observed in human patients, including a drop in cerebrospinal levels of norepinephrine.
While some, like Dr. Nesse at Michigan, propose that depression could be protective, allowing people and other animals with advanced cognitive skills to assess their situations and to consider how their tactics may have backfired and how they can avoid repeating a costly error, others take a less sanguine view. Dr. Suomi suggested that the condition is the downside of a personality that has great payoffs when times are good.
As it turns out, the same monkeys that are susceptible to depression often end up at the top of the social hierarchy. "Like so much in nature, things with potential risks also carry potential benefits," Dr. Suomi said.
The sensitive creatures are more aware than their peers of critical changes in the environment -- the sound of an approaching predator, the tentative gestures of a possible new ally. They see and hear and smell and feel everything. They are like taut strings on a beautiful violin. And if bowed too hard, the strings will snap.

Termite
 When the nests of some species of termites are invaded, they are able to explode their abdomens and expel the foul contents onto invading enemies in order to retard the invasion's progress.
 
Crested penguin
Of the two eggs laid by a crested penguin, one is larger. Some scientists say the smaller chick acquiesces to being killed by the larger, so that resources go to the one most likely to succeed.
 
Naked mole rat
 A mole rate infested with parasites goes off to the toilet area of the burrow and stays there until it starves, rather than risk spreading the infestation to its close relations elsewhere in the burrow.

HEADLINE: It's Sense to Keep Talking to North Korea

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator John McCain (letter, March 28) characterizes the Administration's response to the situation on the Korean Peninsula as concessional. First, let me make it clear that I have the highest regard for the Senator from Arizona. He is a true American hero, who fought valiantly for our country in Vietnam.
Nevertheless, his characterization of the Administration's handling of the crisis as "concession-laden" for attempting to resolve the crisis by diplomacy is unfair. United States policy has been reasoned and reasonable. We have responded to North Korean noncompliance in a tough manner, yet without unnecessarily raising the stakes. What precisely would the Senator have us do? 
 For economic sanctions, we would need cooperation from Japan and China. Japan has several hundred thousand North Koreans on its soil, and China is North Korea's only ally in the world. Yes, China can quiety help convince North Korea it has chosen a dangerous path, but quiet diplomacy is vastly different from agreement by China to negate its many contracts to provide oil and other critical consumer commodities to North Korea. We have all seen how difficult it is to persuade the Chinese to make any improvement in human rights. Does the Senator believe we can persuade China to put a stranglehold on its neighbor and ally?
I visited North Korea last October, and met President Kim Il Sung. I delivered a tough, but not confrontational, message. North Korea is, arguably, the most isolated nation on the face of the planet. With Communism destroyed in Eastern Europe, North Korea remains a bastion of hard-line Stalinist dictatorship in the same neighborhood as some of our most important allies -- Japan and South Korea. The United States and its allies must balance the need to be firm against the possibility North Korea may take precipitous action.
We have not conceded anything to North Korea. We have known from the beginning that the discussions would be protracted. But we are pursuing the right course, and we are delivering tough messages: We are deploying the Patriot missile defense system, and we will accept nothing less than full compliance with international inspection requirements.
The way out of this is not by provoking North Korea into a military attack while we proclaim, "If you do this, we will bury you."
If the North Korean leadership believes the United States may take military action, which will undermine the regime's survival, it may itself pursue a deadly course of action. There is no question that United States and South Korean forces would prevail in the event of armed conflict. But such a conflict could cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of lives.
Our first priority should be to avoid such a debacle. That means diplomacy can and must prevail. That's not concession-laden. That's common sense.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE MEMO SEES HIGHER COSTS FOR WELFARE PLAN

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan to overhaul the welfare system could cost much more in the long run than previously disclosed, possibly adding $58 billion to the nation's welfare costs over 10 years, according to a confidential memorandum presented to Mr. Clinton.
The document also says Mr. Clinton should understand that "in rare circumstances" his plan to enforce a two-year limit on welfare benefits could leave families "homeless or unable to care for their children." 
 The memorandum, drafted by the 32 members of the Administration's working group on welfare, provides the most detailed information yet about the tough decisions Mr. Clinton faces in trying to fulfill one of his most popular campaign pledges. The document was discussed at the only Cabinet meeting on welfare that the President has attended, on March 22.
The memorandum outlines what aides are calling a "Cadillac version" of a welfare proposal, but it acknowledges that its cost may force Mr. Clinton to adopt a more modest plan. Mr. Clinton deferred that decision at the Cabinet meeting two weeks ago. An Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, predicted today that President would adopt a version that would add $35 billion to the cost of welfare over 10 years.
Mr. Clinton has promised to deliver a bill this spring that would expand training programs for people on welfare and require those still unemployed after two years to join a work program.
Financing the new program has become the most problematic aspect of the proposal in recent months. Cabinet officials have repeatedly rejected the program cuts or tax increases suggested by mid-level officials.
The main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, now costs about $22 billion a year. By 1999, the full Clinton plan would increase that figure by about $7 billion a year, according to the document.
The memorandum suggests that long-term costs would be even greater than previously known. Earlier estimates had suggested that the proposed changes would cost about $15 billion for the first five years. The memorandum says that in the second five years of the program, costs would more than double, reaching $58 billion over 10 years. The costs would rise as the program was phased in.
While the plan to impose a two-year limit on welfare benefits sounds like it would save money, it would actually be much more expensive, at least in the short run, than simply mailing a welfare check. That is because the Administration would create training, education and child-care programs, and subsidize the wages of the recipients it puts to work.
The document outlines possible cuts or taxes that would raise tens of billions of dollars over the next decade, but it calls all of the options undesirable. "Each faces serious political problems and raises some substantive concerns," the memorandum said. The document was provided to The New York Times by a person who argues that the money for the welfare changes could be better spent on other programs for low-income Americans.
The document suggests several strategies for reducing the $58 billion cost. One would be to reduce or eliminate a proposed $16 billion expansion of child care for the working poor, which is intended to help parents keep their jobs and stay off welfare. Another would be to cut back an $8 billion expansion of aid to two-parent families, which is meant to prevent fathers from leaving the home.
But the plan argues that Mr. Clinton could not fulfill his political pledges without preserving the work and training programs that cost $6 billion in the first five years, and $24 billion over the first decade.
The 95-page document devotes only a few paragraphs to the plan's potential to force some children into homelessness or foster care. That risk is inherent in the idea of a limit on cash assistance, since without benefits some families could not pay their rent.
Supporters of time limits in both political parties usually try to avoid discussing the possibility of homelessness and foster care. They argue that the limits will help many other poor people by giving them new incentives to find good jobs.
In acknowledging the risks of eviction or family breakups, the Clinton document said there was "no apparent alternative" if the Government was to enforce time limits.
"If the welfare system is working properly, these failures will be extremely rare," it said.
An alternative plan by House Republicans has even stricter time limits, and therefore, presumably carries greater risks that some families would be forced into the street.
 
What If There Are No Jobs?
 The Clinton plan says the instances of homelessness or increased foster care could arise when after the two years a parent refuses to join a work program, or performs the work unsatisfactorily. In such instances, the plan calls for ending cash aid. Food stamps and medical aid would continue.
The Clinton plan also suggests that states could deny cash assistance to people who complete a work assignment but do not show "good faith." While it does not define the term, it said that simply showing up for work "would not, in and of itself, establish cooperation."
The five-year costs of $18 billion reflect about $3 billion in additional expenses that were not spelled out in previous drafts. These include $1.7 billion to allow welfare recipients to keep a higher percentage of their earnings, to encourage them to work.
The plan suggests possible cuts to four programs. Capping the emergency assistance provisions of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, which make payments to families in crisis, could save $5.6 billion over 10 years. Limiting the Child-Care Food Program, which provides food subsidies to children in day care, could save $1.7 billion in a decade.
Changing the welfare eligibility rules for children who live with grandparents or other relatives could save $15 billion over 10 years. But by making it harder for such households to collect welfare, the document notes, the change could force some children into foster care.
The document also contemplates changes that would save up to $23 billion over 10 years by making it harder for legal immigrants to collect Supplemental Security Income payments. It argues that some immigrants are abusing the program by bringing elderly parents to the United States and enrolling them.
The memorandum also contemplates raising $7 billion over 10 years through a 4 percent excise tax on gambling establishments.

HEADLINE: Stocks Break Their Spring Slide With Strongest Surge in 2 Years

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock and bond markets rallied strongly yesterday, halting for now the sharpest decline in years, as some traders were encouraged by new signs that the economy was not growing as rapidly as had been thought.
In a surge of buying and bargain hunting, traders bid up stock prices, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 82.06 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,675.41, the biggest one-day rally in more than two years. 
 The reversal of fortune, after sharp drops in stocks and bonds last week and on Monday, raised spirits on Wall Street even as some traders warned that the slump might not be over.
"It's an encouraging sign that we didn't falter today," said Edward J. Laux, co-head of institutional trading at Kidder, Peabody. "But I don't think the correction is over in the bond market and I don't know what that means for the stock market."
Wall Street experts had widely predicted a 10 percent correction since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in early February. The Dow average has declined about 385 points, or 9.7 percent, from its Jan. 31 peak. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index had similar falls.
Nothing has yet fundamentally changed to alter bond traders' perceptions of another imminent move by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates, nor has anything fundamentally changed their apprehensions about a resurgent economy leading to resurgent inflation, despite scant evidence of that.
Yesterday, a Government report on 11 leading economic indicators showed the first decline in seven months, meaning that economic growth may be more moderate than had been thought. Bond traders were also encouraged by a report showing prices of commodities like gold and oil were rising less rapidly, underscoring that inflation was in check.
As a result, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell from a 15-month high of 7.41 percent, set on Monday, to 7.24 yesterday. [Page D16.]
Whether yesterday's rise is really a "rigor mortis rally," grim Wall Street jargon for an uptick in a larger down market, will depend to a great extent on investor perceptions of the three main factors now moving the markets: interest rates, inflation and corporate earnings.
"People were just getting carried away," said Ronald K. Stribley, a senior portfolio manager who buys stocks and bonds for the Glenmede Trust Company in Philadelphia, which has more than $8.5 billion of assets under management. "Bonds had fallen too much and stocks had fallen too much. But it was mostly that there was just no way anyone could justify a bond at almost 7.5 percent."
In six of the last seven trading sessions, the share prices of some of the nation's most famous corporations had been relentlessly beaten down, so many traders came to the market yesterday poised for bargain buying.
Yesterday's action largely came from big instititional investors like pension funds. The number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 366.9 million shares, or little more than 20 percent above a typical day's volume.
Mutual funds reported that small investors sat on their hands for the most part. Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest manager of mutual funds, reported "modest" inflow of less than $50 million into its stock mutual funds. Phone inquiries were up, but about a third of those calls were seeking advice on tax returns.
"If we are a proxy for the small investor," said Neal Litvack, executive vice president for Fidelity, "I have to believe that most of the action today came from big investors, not small."
Next week could bring indications of vigor in the economy, which would be sour news for bond traders and, therefore, for the stock market. On Tuesday, the Labor Department is to report on the Producer Price Index for March and the next day, the Consumer Price Index. It will be surprising if Wall Street and private economists do not foresee some increased inflation, as spring weather leads to higher retail sales and stepped-up construction.
But the probability remains high that private-sector economists do not have a fully accurate consensus estimate of how fast the economy is growing, and that both the stock and bond markets will overreact to changes in inflation.
Which leads to the third great wild card, first-quarter corporate earnings. Economists calculate that as much as half of the value of a stock reflects estimates of earnings and dividends to be paid over the next five years.
The market may bid stock and bond prices down by interpreting strong earnings not as a sign of health and better earnings to come, but as a sign of an overheating economy, and therefore of sickness.
Yesterday's trading was almost a mirror image of Monday's decline.
Stock prices started up and stayed up. They rose so quickly in the first half hour of trading that the New York Stock Exchange invoked "circuit breaker" rules, limits on high-speed computer-guided trading that are more often imposed to slow market declines.
Shortly before 11:15 A.M., the Dow had risen nearly 68 points, the largest jump since January 1991.
Of the 30 component stocks, 27 rose in price, led by such economically sensitive stocks as United Technologies, which was up 3 1/4, to 65 1/2, and Caterpillar, which rose 3, to 116 1/4.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.37, to 448.29, and the smaller-company Nasdaq index rose 23.54, to 750.95. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.27, to 248.41, and advancing stocks far outnumbered declining stocks 2,152 to 315. The American Stock Exchange market value index was up 6.86, to 440.99.
 
Big Day for Smaller Issues
 Small stocks advanced even more than large ones, with the Nasdaq index's gain of 3.2 percent being its biggest one-day leap since it rose 3.8 percent on Aug. 27, 1990. That rise came during a short-lived rally that interrupted but did not end the stock slump that followed Iraq's invastion of Kuwait.
The Dow's 2.3 percent rise was the strongest since Dec. 23, 1991, when it rose 3 percent in an early phase of a powerful advance.
Even with yesterday's strong rises, both indexes are well below where they were only a week ago. Similarly, while the fall in the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was large, the 7.24 percent yield is still higher than it was as recently as Thursday.
Automobile stocks like General Motors, oil stocks like Chevron, retailers like Sears, Roebuck and financial-services companies like American Express were all prominent in yesterday's rally.
 
On the Active List
 Novell was the most heavily traded stock yesterday at 7.4 million shares as traders awaited the selection of a new chief executive. After the market closed, Novell said a Hewlett-Packard executive, Robert J. Frankenberg, was its choice. Novell shares rose 1 1/2, to 18 3/8, yesterday. They had been dropping recently because of heavy criticism from Wall Street analysts of Novell's planned acquisition of Wordperfect.
Telefonos de Mexico was the most heavily traded stock on the Big Board at 6.8 million shares and it closed up 3/4, to 57 3/4. Telmex is such a large stock that some big institional investors use it as a proxy for the Mexican stock exchange. Yesterday, the Mexican Government reported progress in its investigation of the assassination last month of the leading presidential candidiate.
Woolworth was the second-most heavily traded stock on the Big Board at 5.3 million shares. Its shares have been under pressure because of news reports of late payments to suppliers and reports of possible financial irregularities. Still, Woolworth rose 1 3/4 yesterday, to 14 3/4.

HEADLINE: Minority Students Languish In Special Education System

SERIES: A Class Apart: Special Education In New York City -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
Radheya Mathews attends ninth grade in a public school for special education students in the Bronx, but it is as if he had dropped out in spirit many years ago. He sits lethargically in class. He often walks out. He has a thick file of suspensions. But at home, he is a gifted artist who quietly tucks away his fancy pencil drawings in a Timberland shoe box.
To the 15-year-old, the Lincoln Adolescent Youth Achievement Center, the public school that he attends for children labeled emotionally disturbed, is an "asylum," a place with no windows and no hope. 
 "I don't even know that much anymore," he said. "There really isn't any advantage of staying. If I was to graduate, I probably wouldn't get no job anyway because I didn't learn nothing."
Radheya has languished in the special education system since he was sent there for disruptiveness and poor schoolwork five years ago. His mother says he was evaluated independently several years ago and found able to attend regular classes as long as he received extra counseling. But since then, not only has he remained in special education, he has also been channeled into classes that are less and less challenging.
Nearly two decades after Congress passed a law requiring public schools to educate all children with disabilities, providing extra money for smaller classes, special assistance for a variety of disabilities and individual attention, many education advocates say New York City's special education system, which involves 130,000 students, insures a second-class education, particularly for black boys, becoming a trap that incubates failure. At the heart of the issue is compelling evidence that black and Hispanic students are harmed, not helped, by special education.
Nationwide, black students are twice as likely to be in special education programs as white children, with much higher rates in predominantly white districts, according to some academic studies. Yet, these same students perform better in regular classes with extra support, Federal studies suggest.
Nearly one-third of all special education students -- including a majority of those labeled emotionally disturbed -- are arrested at least once after leaving high school. Forty-three percent of those who graduate remain unemployed three to five years after high school, and about one-fourth of special education students drop out, according to several Federal reports.
Some of this is attributable to the conditions of the children themselves, but researchers in several states suggest that the system itself is at least partly to blame. Children from the same pool of students achieve more, stay in school longer and get along better with others if they stay in regular classes.
Special services for children who are labeled as having disabling conditions have rapidly expanded since the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed by the Federal Government in 1975. The legislation required state and local educators to provide a free and appropriate education for disabled students in the least restrictive school setting.
And while many agree on the need for specially geared classes for profoundly retarded children or those with other special needs, many advocates and educators say New York has gone too far. Advocates for Children, a nonprofit student-rights group in New York City, says tens of thousands of schoolchildren are funneled into the system unnecessarily.
Political leaders from Secretary of Education Richard S. Riley to New York City's School Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, acknowledge faults in the system, at both national and local levels, and promise major changes.
Mr. Riley, in his State of Education speech in February, cited the nation's high dropout rate among blacks and asked: "Could it be that in our attempt to do good -- offering pullout programs and overlabeling students into special education classes -- we have contributed in some significant way to a sense of classification and racial stereotyping that tells these young people early on that they will not make it in life, so why even try?"
Mr. Riley and Mr. Cortines are among the educators calling for a greater emphasis on training children for the workplace and for raising both academic standards and expectations. At both the local and Federal levels, they are asking for reviews of the special education system to insure that children are not being unduly removed from regular classrooms.
"Most children, with the appropriate support, should be able to stay in the neighborhood school program," said Judith E. Heumann, Assistant Secretary of Education. "Children identified as having special education needs should not be de facto removed from classroom settings."
But despite such views, there seems to be little incentive to limit special education and every incentive to expand it -- the schools receive up to $10,000 per student in extra Federal money, and teachers can effectively reduce class size by funneling bothersome students to special education.
 
Lost Hopes
Once In, Always In
 In New York City, where at least $1.3 billion is spent annually to maintain the city's vast special education structure, the more than 130,000 students receiving special education services represent a quadrupling in the 19 years since the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed. According to a report by the Advocates for Children, about two-thirds of them, including Radheya, are placed in programs exclusively for special education students, isolated from general education students.
Radheya's day at Lincoln, in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, begins with social studies, then science, then a free period where students play pool or go to a game room or the cafeteria. He moves on to math class, then communications arts, the only class that engages his mind. "It's work. I'm writing something. I'm occupied."
Peter Mills, Radheya's uncle who counsels schoolchildren on substance abuse prevention, says that as a result of being in special education, Radheya has fallen far behind. "It happens a lot with kids who have aggressive behavior," he said. "Things happen to kids who are not challenged."
For Sandra Mills, Radheya's mother, the promise of smaller classes and personal attention had a bright appeal during her son's primary school years.
But Ms. Mills, who is a day care worker, said she was never told that once placed in special education, students are almost never "decertified" and allowed to return to regular education, and that most never finish high school. Ms. Mills also said she did not know that fewer than five percent graduate in four years, and that of the substantial number who remain in high school for seven years until they are 21 and "age out," only one-fourth graduate with some kind of diploma.
Radheya was consigned to the city's special education system in the third grade because of unruliness and poor schoolwork. But his mother attributes those problems to trouble at home: her marriage was unraveling, and she was about to give birth to a boy who would claim Radheya's place as the baby of the family.
"I felt he was very confused because a lot of things were going on," Ms. Mills said.
School officials approached her about placing Radheya in special education. Though parents have a right to refuse the services, Ms. Mills signed her consent to place him in a modified instructional program for students identified with mild to moderate learning disabilities. Since then his mother has tried to wrest him from what she sees as a Kafkaesque cul-de-sac.
 
Drawings From a Box
 She had him independently tested five years ago by the Manhattan Eye and Ear Clinic, which evaluates students with many kinds of disabilities. She said the clinic recommended that he be placed in regular classes, but taken out daily for extra academic help. But the Board of Education disagreed and kept him in the special program. School officials declined to comment, citing confidentiality.
On a recent night, Ms. Mills's face brightened when her son pulled out his cartoon drawings from the Timberland shoe box. But her smile faded when her son picked up an old colored drawing of three close friends, one of whom was later shot to death. With her own son's prospects so seemingly bleak, Ms. Mills worries what will become of him.
"My fear is that he'll just give up and not complete school," she said. "Special education has affected his ability to even try."
Ms. Mills said her son never talks of his dream to be a cartoonist anymore.
 
Diagnosis
 The Element Of Color
 Like Radheya, the majority of children in New York's special education program are classified as either learning disabled or emotionally disturbed. Those are two of 13 diagnoses established under the 1975 legislation, but unlike some of the other areas -- blindness, deafness, mental retardation, autism or chronic illnesses like cerebral palsy -- a diagnosis for either emotional disturbance or learning disability can be based on varying perceptions about what constitutes troubled behavior or impairment.
Walter Stafford, a New York University professor who has studied problems among black and Hispanic men, said, "Congress passed the law to deal with special education at the historical moment when the education community knew something about kids with physical disabilities but didn't know anything about these areas where kids had emotional or other considerations."
"The education community had to turn around and create a new body of learning," he said. "The result has been that a lot of kids have been experimented on."
Black children are more likely to be classified as emotionally disturbed or mentally retarded in New York City schools, while children with limited English proficiency are far more likely to be classified as learning disabled or speech impaired, Advocates for Children says.
Eighty-four percent of New York students in exclusively special education classes were black and Hispanic at a time when the student population was 73 percent black and Hispanic in city schools, a 1990 schools report found. White students, who accounted for 20 percent of the city's school population, made up 37 percent of the students receiving support services alone, typically in regular schools.
 
Poverty, Not Bias
 It is difficult to tease out an overriding factor to explain the persistent pattern of overreferrals of black children to special education, but academic experts and educators suggest that cultural bias and socioeconomic influences are among the tangle of reasons.
A recent Federal study of special education students suggests that in some areas, at least, it is poverty, not discrimination that determines whether students are placed in special education and what happens to them afterward. But many education advocates disagree with assessments that discount cultural biases.
"Clearly part of the problem is a negative expectancy on the part of many educators toward the prospects and possibilities of children of color," said Galen Kirkland, executive director of Advocates for Children. "Frequently what ends up happening is that people assume that once a problem becomes apparent, there's no hope. This person is doomed."
The most critical stage of assigning a child to special education is the referral by a teacher or a school. A school-based evaluating team, which includes a psychologist, generally goes along with the teachers' judgments. Of the children referred to special education, about 90 percent are tested and about 70 percent are found to need special education, said James Ysseldyke, an educational psychology professor at the University of Minnesota.
"Studies show teachers refer kids who bother them, and we've been able to demonstrate that specifically African-American males demonstrate behavior that bothers teachers," he said.
Robert L. Green, a Cleveland State University professor and an expert on school desegregation, said cultural apathy is at the root of the imbalances. "The essential problem comes from the structure and attitudes of those in public education today who simply are not overly concerned as to whether or not minority kids learn," he said. "The burning agenda in America is to build more prisons and to find new ways to lock them up. That is more of a conscious agenda."
 
Salvation
 Teacher Makes Big Difference
 No one needs to preach to Ted Gustus Jr. about the need to send children back into the mainstream. Behind a closed door at Junior High School 275 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Mr. Gustus, a crisis intervention teacher, hears their rage.
"Many of them say, 'Since I'm in special education, I might as well act like special education,' " Mr. Gustus said. "The kids begin to act out a self-fulfilling prophecy. I make them say over and over again, 'I want to be out of special education. I want to go into the mainstream.' "
Around campus, Mr. Gustus is known as "Cut 'em Loose Bruce" because of his interventions among students he sees as trapped by the system. "It's like a kid being in prison," he said. "You are taken out of society."
Partly because of his concern, Mr. Gustus eight years ago created the "Say Yes to Success" Sports Foundation, a mentoring program for minority children with histories of delinquency, truancy and academic failure. He searches out youths on basketball courts, on the streets and in school hallways.
Mr. Gustus, who is 40, identifies with these boys. Raised poor in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Mr. Gustus said he frequently forgot to study and was forced to repeat fourth grade because his behavior and attendance were poor. His mother died of alcoholism when he was 9, and his father was not around. He moved from one relative's house to the next, shifted from school to school. He says he thinks he would have been in special education, had it existed then.
Instead, he made it through school, stigma-free. "I didn't have a label, and the teachers had to deal with it," he said.
One of Mr. Gustus's rescues is Marquis Scott, a gentle-spoken former student who is now 22 and a mental health worker at New York Hospital. Mr. Scott offers himself as a role model and recruits for the mentoring program.
In the eighth grade, Mr. Scott spent half his school days in special education classes for children with emotional problems in the basement of Ditmas Junior High School in Flatbush. He had fallen behind in school and was hanging out with a tough crowd of boys. He had moved a few years before from Trinidad, where he had lived for most of his life with his grandmother. In New York, he had a distant relationship with his biological mother and no relationship at all with her boyfriend.
Mr. Scott said he was so ashamed of the special education label that he ordered his mother not to tell a soul. "The system is telling you that you have a disability and you can't learn at the same rate as other students."
During a basketball tournament, he met Mr. Gustus, who also works part-time as an after-school basketball coach at Nazareth Regional Catholic School in East Flatbush. Mr. Gustus spirited him out of the public schools altogether, quietly engineering his placement in Nazareth.
"I thought Marquis was not an emotional problem but having a problem with schoolwork because he needed additional attention until he could catch up with students," Mr. Gustus said.
With the help of a priest who tutored him during his lunch break, Mr. Scott flourished without special education classes. He attended the State University of New York College at Potsdam, and recently helped his mother buy a home.
When asked what might have become of him without his chance meeting with Mr. Gustus, the young man paused to reflect. "There are so many things on the streets that are negative. You never know."
 
Alternatives
 Better Use Of Money
 The alternatives to special education are clear to some education observers and academic experts. They say a great deal of special education money would be better spent in regular classrooms, on tutors, classroom aides and staff development. Schools could use consultants, team teachers and instruction strategies like having children of varying abilities work together to help each other learn.
Many parents and educators worry about including handicapped students in regular classes, for fear they will be dragged down. But educators and advocates for the disabled say their presence would draw support services back into the mainstream. And studies show that many special education students showed gains in self-esteem, improved behavior and emotional adjustment, and better skills in social situations when placed in classrooms with regular students.
The degree to which children identified as disabled are taught in regular classrooms varies widely from state to state. In Vermont, 87 percent of special education students were in regular classes, compared with 7 percent in New York and nearly 25 percent in California, according to a recent Federal report.
In Philadelphia, students are being weaned from special education in experimental programs and showing encouraging results in the city's regular classrooms, said James Lytle, the assistant superintendent.
 
'Going to Drop Out'
 "Inclusion, particularly in the categories of learning disabled and emotional support, is imperative simply because the kids are going to drop out unless they become a part of the regular education setting," Mr. Lytle said.
Damon Kimber is struggling hard not to become another student lost to the mainstream.
On a bright Saturday afternoon, the 11th grader rose before a crowd that packed the basement of the Mandala Cultural Center of Harlem to celebrate black history. He told the audience how he had been taking exclusively special education classes at the High School of Graphic Communications Arts, but that he hoped to get out of the system sometime soon. This year, for the first time ever, he began taking a hygiene class with regular education students. He also has a part-time clerical job at the Health and Hospitals Corporation that is counted as regular education credit for an advanced shop class.
In the audience, his aunt and foster mother, Alberta Morgan, listened in awe. The boy was so ashamed of his diagnosis, he would barely hold his head up when he was placed in her care four years ago.
His own mother, a drug abuser, had signed her consent to have him placed in special education when he was five years old. Diagnosed as educably mentally retarded, he has been in special education programs ever since.
But Ms. Morgan, a surrogate parent for seven other foster children also in the city's special education program, believes Damon can be successful in the mainstream.
So does he.
"It will help me more than special education," Damon said. "It makes me feel good. It makes me move ahead. It's important because it makes me advance like a professional. In special education, it slows you down."

HEADLINE: U.S. Peace Effort in Bosnia Withers Under Serb Attack

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 5

 BODY:
After six weeks of rapid progress that raised hopes for an overall Bosnian settlement, American attempts to resolve the Balkan conflict are floundering, beset by a worsening military situation and a diplomatic impasse over what territorial concessions are needed for peace.
United States officials said that a Bosnian Serb offensive against the Muslim-held enclave of Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia, and attacks on Muslim civilians in Serbian-held territory in northwestern Bosnia have renew serious questions about whether the Serbs are interested in a settlement. 
 On the other hand, they said, the Muslim-led Bosnian Government has been showing growing resistance to an American proposal that it should accept a peace settlement that offers the recently formed Muslim-Croatian federation 51 percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian Government is pressing for considerably more land.
 
Serbs Must Cede Land
 The Bosnian Serbs, after two years of largely victorious war, control 72 percent of the territory and would have to bring their share down to 49 percent under the proposal.
"We're not prepared to go beyond 51 percent for the Muslims, which is the position we have agreed with the Europeans and that Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic had indicated last year would be acceptable," said one official close to the American diplomatic efforts. "But the Muslims are now saying they want all ethnically cleansed land back, and there's just no way you can fit that into 51 percent."
The combination of Bosnian Serb brutality in Gorazde and Prijedor and the increasingly uncompromising position of Mr. Izetbegovic's Government has brought the American diplomatic effort, led by Charles Redman, a special envoy, to a virtual standstill, the officials said.
"Right now, we're treading water," said a second official.
 
Conflicting Reports
 Conflicting reports exist on the intensity of the Bosnian Serb attack on Gorazde, and some United States officials believe accounts from Sarajevo radio are probably exaggerated.
But whatever its true extent, American officials say, the attack looks more like a reflection of the divergent positions among Serb leaders in Serbia and Bosnia.
The President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, is said to be eager to find a settlement because his priority is to insure the lifting of crippling economic sanctions on the Yugoslav federation.
But the Bosnian Serb military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, appears to be opposed to the surrender of any land for which his soldiers have fought. "Mladic remains hard-core," said one official.
 
General's Daughter a Suicide
 The latest Serbian offensive in Gorazde followed a shattering personal tragedy for General Mladic. His 23-year-old daughter, Ana, a fifth-year medicial student in Belgrade, committed suicide 10 days ago, Western diplomats in Belgrade said.
For the United States, the situation poses delicate problems. "The Serbs seem to be saying they don't want peace and we can't force it on them," said one official.
The territorial division is equally delicate. Washington's view is that Muslim-held eastern enclaves such as Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde may not be strategically viable in the long term, and that the Bosnian Government might be well advised to exchange some of these towns for more territory around Sarajevo.
"The eastern enclaves are completely non-viable but very emotional for the Muslims," said one official. "Giving them up is like giving up part of their body. So the question is, what is as valuable that the Serbs could give up in exchange? The answer of course, is Sarajevo. But there the Serbs won't budge."

HEADLINE: Parking-Ticket Kvetches Save Companies Money;
With Millions at Stake, Businesses Find Ways to Fight City Fines, and They Often Win

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Martha Pabon, the fleet manager for a Manhattan company, went into the Parking Violations Bureau in Greenwich Village the other day, carrying 15 tickets, a dog-eared copy of the city's traffic and parking handbook and affidavits signed by her company's drivers and customers.
She walked out 20 minutes later with 12 tickets dismissed, 2 fines reduced and 1 ticket she had to pay in full. Instead of $885 in fines, she ended up paying $110. 
 In the intimidatingly named Parking Violations Bureau Commercial Adjudication Center, Ms. Pabon has overcome the Byzantine regulations that, on this day, left one man cursing the bureau as a kangaroo court, and alternately pleading for a second hearing. At P. J. Mechanical Corporation, a heating and air-conditioning company, she holds a position that is becoming a staple in businesses making deliveries or service calls in the city: parking-ticket fighter.
For the average New Yorker with a car, simply paying a ticket is probably cheaper than fighting it. But things are different for companies with dozens of vehicles making hundreds of stops a day and receiving scores of tickets a month.
 
Good Odds for Challenges
 In a city where there is a one-in-three chance of getting a ticket dismissed in court and an equal likelihood of getting a fine reduced, ticket-fighting is a growing industry.
Last year, 11.3 million summonses were issued, 1.1 million of them to commercial vehicles with New York licenses, and 2.6 million tickets were challenged. Of these, 1.7 million tickets, worth millions of dollars, were reduced or dismissed.
But the time and staff needed to fight these tickets hurt companies and the local economy, says Sheldon Glick, president of Contractors Against Unfair Taxation Instituted on New Yorkers, a group formed last year to press for changes in the city's parking regulations. Mr. Glick says that a few of the group's 100 members are being fined between $25,000 and $50,000 a year. "Some companies have a full-time employee fighting tickets," he says.
Others, like P. J. Mechanical, give the job to an employee with other responsibilities. And for smaller concerns, there are parking-ticket mercenaries, including brokers who fight tickets for companies and a marketer of a new computer software program.
 
'If I'm Guilty, I'll Pay'
 So far, the city says, parking tickets issued in the 1993 fiscal year have resulted in $196 million in fines from New York passenger vehicles and $30 million from New York commercial drivers in New York.
Most fines are for staying beyond the limit of three hours in commercial parking spots, which occupy nearly half the street parking space in midtown Manhattan. The limit was increased from 30 minutes about a year ago. Each ticket is $55.
Michael Primeggia, the Transportation Department's deputy commissioner of traffic, scoffs at charges that the city is seeking to to raise revenues by ticketing.
The department's role is loftier, he says: it is a detached arbitrator in the Hobbesian world of Manhattan where passenger cars, commercial vehicles, buses, and taxis, as well as diplomatic, government and press vehicles all fight for a piece of the street.
"It's a situation that's kind of exciting and quite fluid where you look at the various needs the city has and you provide space for all of those needs," he says. "Not one instead of another. You balance the need and competition for that space."
 
Computers Catch Errors
 Ms. Pabon, who never drives for the company but takes fines personally, says, "If I'm guilty, I'll pay. But the point is: If I'm parked for an hour, that's not long enough to make a delivery. On a service call, you just can't tell a customer, 'I've got to go and move my van.' "
Certainly few businesses can match Ms. Pabon's ticket-killer instincts.
"I used to fight, but I don't anymore," says Lee Battle, the vice president of Beehive Beer Distributors in Long Island City. "I was paying them anyway, so I'd just be losing time." Nowadays the company, which has 50 trucks making up to 800 deliveries a day, does not contest about $30,000 in fines a year, most of them incurred in Manhattan.
Near Union Square, in a small office he shares with an advertising agent, Glen Bolofsky, a publisher, says he has come up with something for the Mr. Battles in New York: a computer software program named A.L.A.R.M., which ferrets out mistakes in parking tickets and prints out dismissal requests to the P.V.B. "It comes with a guarantee that your annual parking ticket expenses will fall by 25 to 50 percent," he says.
Since he began selling the program five months ago, sales have totaled about $50,000. The software costs between $295 and $1,495, depending on the size of a company's fleet.
 
Wrong Color Blocks Fines
 Mark Conrad, a P.V.B. judge from 1987 to 1993 who was a consultant for the program, explains that certain errors on the tickets invalidate them immediately: a vehicle's wrong color, make, model, body type or license plate number or an imprecise location on the street.
The lack of a full registration expiration date was the most frequent error he saw during his years as a P.V.B. judge, Mr. Conrad said.
"On a given day," he said, "anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of summonses were really suspect."
Don Karl, fleet manager of Kraft Food Services's New York region, just paid $1,000 for the software program for his 50 delivery trucks in New York City.
Saving only a quarter of the $30,000 in fines he pays annually would mollify him -- never mind the psychological side-benefits. "Dealing with a large city you feel inept," he said. "But this system makes you feel in control."
Not everyone is so impressed. Mark Gerstle, a parking ticket broker, sneers at the computer program, which he cannot bring himself to call by name. Mr. Gerstle, who has built up a clientele of more than 100 over 21 years, claims to be the first full-time independent parking broker in New York, though with no one to keep track of how many brokers there are, it's a title impossible to check.
 
Problems Acknowledged
 Out of his Upper West Side office, he explains his method: old-fashioned diplomacy with the parking judge. "You can't have that tete-a-tete without being there," he said. "If you're talking paper to person, it's impersonal."
Mr. Gerstle, whose fees vary depending on how successful he is, said he was able to get more than a third of the tickets he handles for companies dismissed.
Joseph A. Spencer, the P.V.B. director, said he wanted to make the commercial adjudication center so easy to use that no company would feel the need to use a broker. But he conceded there were many problems. Working through the bureaucracy was too overwhelming for many, he said. Records were inaccurate. The system was too slow.
But the commissioner pointed to recent improvements. A clerk now appears at every hearing and records the decision in a computer database, for example; in the past, judges wrote down the decisions and records were often inaccurate.
"There's still some more progress to be made," he said. "We would like to make it less frustrating for people who come upon this for the first time."
 
Dangers of Overconfidence
 No matter what the changes are, some, like Ms. Pabon, will remain better at fighting tickets than others are.
Still, as she left the P.V.B. office recently, walking through a narrow hall lined with cardboard boxes stacked seven high and filled with three-year-old files, Ms. Pabon said that three years of fighting parking tickets had taught her not to grow overconfident.
Last November, her company, which has 56 vans, trucks and station wagons, received a ticket for an illegally parked Mercedes. The Mercedes, it turned out, belonged to a Connecticut driver with the same license plate number as one of her trucks in New York. But the P.V.B. insisted the company must have a Mercedes. And Ms. Pabon, normally so unruffled, despaired.
"Do you know how hard it is to prove you don't have a Mercedes?" she asked.

HEADLINE: In St. Petersburg, a Struggle for Room at the Top

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia

 BODY:
Peter the Great built this city in a monumental act of will nearly three centuries ago. And in a similar vein, Sergei N. Nikeshin, one of St. Petersburg's new, rich Russian businessmen, is planning to build himself a 40-story skyscraper high above the city's haunting neo-classical architecture.
The city's intelligentsia wants him stopped. 
 "It is an abomination," said Dmitri S. Likhachev, 87, a historian of ancient Russian literature who is one of the country's most venerated scholars. He said the tower would do what even the Bolsheviks dared not. "It will ruin St. Petersburg's historic skyline."
While such fights occur in cities like Paris, London and New York between those who want to preserve architectural purity and those who want Trump Towers, the battle here pits intellectuals against Russians who got rich after Communism collapsed and are now reveling in their success. So the underlying tension is about class and pride and history.
Preservation of the city's many pastel palaces, rococo mansions and gold-domed churches is more than an esthetic choice in St. Petersburg. For many, it is the expression of the city's resistance to the Nazis and to Communism. And residents are highly sensitive about the status of a former capital described by the Russian writer Daniel Granin as "a great city with a provincial fate."
 
The Spoils of Freedom
 St. Petersburg writers and artists believed that they had won the war against Communism. But today, members of the intelligentsia, many of whom have lost their perks and pre-eminence, complain that the spoils of freedom are being sucked up by rough-hewn businessmen and mobsters.
"We are not moving toward capitalism in Russia," Mr. Likhachev said sorrowfully. "We are going to some kind of Arab or African system, where the money and power is in just a few hands."
Mr. Nikeshin, 35, said construction of the 40-story office complex, which he named the Peter the Great Tower, would begin in June. The project, which received the blessing of City Hall late last year, is not in the historic center of town, where the Winter Palace and St. Isaac's Cathedral are located. Instead, it will face the Gulf of Finland on the western edge of Vasilyevsky Island, where clusters of nine-story concrete-and-steel apartment buildings were erected under Khrushchev.
But the island's other side, on the banks of the Neva River, bears 18th-century landmarks like St. Petersburg University, which boasts Lenin and Raskolnikov, the murderer in Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment," among its dropouts. The island is also where Mr. Likhachev's stately office, lined with portraits of Pushkin and Turgenev, is located.
 
Two Opposing Views
 Mr. Likhachev said he opposed the skyscraper because it would jut high above the city's low, undulating skyline of golden domes and slender spires and be an eyesore even from the Hermitage Museum three miles away.
Mr. Nikeshin said his office tower would "beautify" the city.
The Mayor is torn. A former law professor, Anatoly A. Sobchak was himself a member of the intelligentsia, and stood by Mr. Likhachev's side during the city's huge rally to protest the attempted hard-line Communist coup in August 1991.
To attract capital to his financially strapped city, Mayor Sobchak and his aides have forged tight alliances with foreign investors and Russian business people. But almost every development deal the city has struck, including an agreement with a French bank to convert Peter the Great's shipbuilding yard into a $500 million business and cultural center, has been stalled by political controversy.
Tellingly, one of the first major protest rallies in St. Petersburg after the fall of Communism was not about politics, but about architecture: in 1987 many thousands of people demonstrated against tearing down an old hotel where, among other things, the beloved poet Sergei Yesinin committed suicide. The facade was later reconstructed. (The city recently agreed to allow Holiday Inn to manage the hotel, the Astoria.)
 
Another Scandal
 Mr. Sobchak extended Mr. Nikeshin the equivalent of $1.3 million in credit to get his building started, and set off another scandal.
The city's chief architect, Deputy Mayor Oleg A. Kharchenko, has responded to criticism that he is turning the city into a Manhattan or a Hong Kong by rejecting the architects' first draft, which looked a little like a squat Empire State Building, and sketching his own version, topped by a cupola and spire. He said this would allow the building's silhouette to "blend."
Mr. Likhachev shuddered at the very idea, calling it "horrible."
Architecture is so emotional an issue here that each of the leading antagonists accused the other of the worst behavior imaginable -- Soviet. Mr. Kharchenko told Mr. Likhachev that criticizing a building he had not seen was like banning Boris Pasternak without having read "Dr. Zhivago."
Mr. Likhachev snapped back, "I haven't seen a tank either, but I can still say it was wrong to send tanks into Czechoslovakia."
 
Dismisses the Controversy
 Mr. Nikeshin, a tall, heavyset former construction engineer who turned a state construction company into the Corporation of the 20th Century Trust, dismissed the controversy. "Around here," he said,"someone is always against something or other."
He has hired a London architectural firm, William Mason & Partners, and a New York City structural engineering firm, Weiskopf & Pickworth, to help him fashion the "world-class office complex" that he said would cost around $120 million. Mr. Nikeshin, who is also running for the city legislature as a pro-business candidate, said he would personally secure 30 percent of the financing.
Seated in his Nevsky Prospekt office, where the couches are black leather, the walls sponge-painted, and the two security guards wear cobalt-blue double-breasted suits, Mr. Nikeshin said he did not mind being called nouveau riche.
"If I was building a private home or stashing my money in Switzerland, that would be nouveau riche," he said. "But I'm doing this for St. Petersburg."
People like Mr. Nikeshin do not often mix with Mr. Likhachev's set, but unlike the much larger city of Moscow, in St. Petersburg they sometimes meet -- if only to jostle one another on the crowded sidewalks of Nevsky Prospekt.
In one of the boulevard's better bookstores, a young woman in stretch pants and a sable parka was browsing. Next to her, Melita D. Krilova, a 73-year-old retired geologist with the posture of a dancer, sold a pile of rare books for $8.
"I hate to part with them," she said with a pained smile, "but we have to eat."
Mrs. Krilova, who like many other academics has all but lost her pension to inflation, said she "never dreamed" the end of Communism would lead to such "disequilibrium" between rich and poor.
She also said she never dreamed a skyscraper could be built in St. Petersburg.
"Surely," she said quietly, "people will protest."
But it is not clear what the opponents of Mr. Nikeshin's tower will actually do. Aleksandr V. Kobak, vice president of the St. Petersburg Cultural Foundation, a nonprofit organization, is strongly against the project.
Somewhat helplessly, he said he hoped that Prince Charles, an outspoken critic of modern architecture who is expected to visit in May, would attract Western interest to the cause.
Others put their hopes in Russia's economic disarray.
 
Lack of Money a Comfort?
 "My only comfort," said Semion I. Mikhailovsky, a professor of architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts, "is that, as usual, they probably won't find the money for it after all."
Other people, however, are less protective of the city's past.
"For heaven's sake, let them build it," said Viktor Y. Demetov, who works in a beer factory and lives in one of the modern apartment buildings near the site.
"It is stupid to stop it -- it could bring in more money." He paused, and smiled wistfully. "It might even be nice."

SPECIAL EDUCATION'S MINORITY TRAP
Nearly two decades after Congress passed a law requiring public schools to educate all children with disabilities, providing extra money for smaller classes, special assistance for a variety of disabilities and individual attention, many education advocates say New York City's special education system, which involves 130,000 students, insures a second-class education, particularly for black boys, becoming a trap that incubates failure.

HEADLINE: Albany Talks Bogging Down Over Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 5

 BODY:
A sharp policy disagreement over whose taxes to cut has emerged as a central obstacle to a new state budget, now five days late, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders made clear today.
Five days after saying they had the outlines of a new budget, several issues that from the start had been viewed as vital were clearly still in dispute. In addition to the tax fight, budget negotiators were arguing over how to allocate aid to schools and how to divide construction money that New York City wants to repair schools and that other communities want for swimming pools and minor-league baseball stadiums. 
 The tax debate was the clearest policy schism. Mr. Cuomo has found himself in this campaign year allied with the Republicans who control the State Senate, saying the cut should be focused on a general reduction in the state business tax. On the other side was the Assembly's Democratic leader, who favored cuts directed to working-poor families and small businesses.
 
Lagging Economy
 Each side argued that tax cuts should be used to spur the state's lagging economy and make it more competitive with surrounding states. The Governor and the Republicans say their business-tax cuts would do this by encouraging businesses to expand in the state. But the Democrats in the Assembly say there is little evidence such a reduction would help create new jobs.
The dispute was made possible by the agreement on all sides that economic growth, even if not as great as the politicians would like in an election year, would be enough to produce more revenues than the Governor had said he anticipated as recently as two months ago.
Mr. Cuomo had said in his budget proposal that he expected enough revenue for $210 million in tax cuts, which he proposed to spend on a reduction in the corporate surcharge from 15 percent, to 12.5 percent, as well as a phaseout over several years of the state's 5 percent tax on hotel rooms costing more than $100 a night.
But the agreement that there would be more money available in the new $33.4 billion budget led the Republicans, with Mr. Cuomo's agreement, to say the surcharge should be reduced to 10 percent and the hotel tax eliminated this year.
 
Governor's Position
 "My position is if you stay with the tax cuts I recommended, like the hotel tax and the corporate surcharge, I will have no difficulties at all," Mr. Cuomo said.
But the Democrats who control the Assembly have advanced two entirely different tax-cut ideas: one to reduce corporate taxes on certain types of small companies and another to give tax credits to companies that create new jobs. The Assembly Democrats have also called for expanding a proposal by the Governor to create tax credits for working-poor families. "They're pushing for corporate welfare," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
The lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo are haggling over additional revenue from better-than-anticipated tax collections for the fiscal year ended on March 31. Just how much more revenue was in dispute, with several hundred million dollars separating the smaller estimates from the Assembly and the larger estimates from the Senate. That difference is not huge in a $33 billion state budget, but it is enough to pay for tax cuts or spending that constituents might notice.
Disputes have even broken out on taxes yet to be collected. Some lawmakers argued that the state should anticipate a windfall of $26 million to $78 million in taxes from the estate of Roy H. Park, founder of a newspaper publishing company, who died last fall. Mr. Cuomo has said there is no evidence the state will get any taxes from the estate. "Someone wrote a story saying this guy died upstate, that he will owe $78 million, and so the Legislature said, 'Here's $78 million we can spend,' " Mr. Cuomo said last week. "This guy's not even cold."
 
Construction Projects
 The Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans were also locked in a fight today over how to allocate hundreds of millions in construction and maintenance projects around the state. In longstanding Albany tradition, the fight has turned on whether New York City is receiving too much or too little of state programs.
The Assembly has called for financing the repair of dilapidated schools in New York City and its suburbs, where most Democratic lawmakers live, as well as building sports stadiums in some upstate cities. But the Senate has proposed building minor-league baseball stadiums, pools, soccer fields and other sports centers in the suburbs, upstate towns and rural areas they represent.
 
'It's Preposterous'
 Mr. Silver said today that Senate negotiators have argued that school maintenance money for New York City should be deducted from the city's total share of state aid to schools. Mr. Silver objected, saying the city already did not receive its fair share of school aid.
"It's preposterous," Mr. Silver said. "If school maintenance should come out of school aid for the city, then the value of their soccer stadium and pool should come out of Long Island's share of school aid."
He was referring to two proposals on the Senate's list of capital projects: a $25 million Olympic-size pool and an approximately $20 million soccer stadium, both to be built near Hofstra University in Hempstead in Nassau County. Several powerful Senate Republicans, including the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, come from Nassau County.
A spokesman for Mr. Marino, John A. McArdle, said the Senator believes the stadiums will attract international sporting events and help stimulate Long Island's economy. But Mr. Marino's first priority, he said, is cutting taxes.
 
Business Tax Cuts
 Mr. Marino has proposed tax cuts worth $700 million in the coming fiscal year, mostly for businesses. But many Republicans acknowledge there might not be enough additional revenue to make cuts that deep.
Mr. Silver said the Assembly's $200 million tax-cut package includes giving low-income families an earned-income credit equal to 10 percent of a similar Federal tax credit this tax year, then doubling the credit the next year. The proposal would double a tax credit proposed by Mr. Cuomo.
The Assembly Democrats have also urged cutting a surcharge on the taxes of small companies owned by 35 or fewer partners. Those partners pay income taxes on company earnings, but the companies also pay additional corporate taxes. Mr. Silver said the two-tier system was unfair.

HEADLINE: Texan Tries For Victory As New Sort Of Democrat

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 5

 BODY:
There is a joke among some Texas Democrats these days that the party is so desperate to recapture Lloyd Bentsen's Senate seat that it is on the verge of nominating a Republican to do it.
But the man to whom the joke refers, Richard W. Fisher, a wealthy Dallas investor, could stake a better claim as a sort of Zelig of recent American history, variously seen side by side with Democrats, Republicans and even Ross Perot. 
 As he begins to gather momentum in his effort to capture the nomination in a bitter primary runoff with former State Attorney General Jim Mattox next Tuesday, the candidacy of Mr. Fisher has become an test of whether a self-styled "New Democrat" can vault to the Senate by emphasizing his broad appeal to Republicans and independents, or whether his campaign will go down in flames as an object lesson in party loyalty.
The 45-year-old Mr. Fisher, who was an aide to Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal in the Carter Administration, has donated thousands of dollars to candidates from both parties over the years, including five of the Democrats who sought the Presidential nomination in 1988.
 
Interviewed for Bush
 He also interviewed for a unspecified job in the Bush Administration and wrote a $1,000 check to the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign in 1991. He says the contribution was supposed to be from his wife, Nancy Collins Fisher, a Bush family friend and the daughter of Jim Collins, a late Republican Congressman from Dallas. At his request, he says, the campaign returned his check, and Mrs. Fisher wrote one instead.
Then, in 1992, he emerged as a top adviser to a fellow Dallasite, Mr. Perot, "a good family friend" who attended Mr. Fisher's wedding more than 20 years ago. When Mr. Fisher last year ran for office for the first time, in a bid financed with $2 million of his own money, commercials featured him holding Mr. Perot's book, "United We Stand." Mr. Fisher came in fifth in the bipartisan special election to replace Mr. Bentsen in the Senate; the winner was Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican.
But just days after the 1992 Presidential election, Mr. Fisher also showed up sitting next to Bill Clinton at the economic conference the President-elect held in Little Rock, Ark. Mr. Fisher has known Mr. Clinton since the mid-1980's, when they worked to form the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group.
In his new bid for a Senate seat that had been in Democratic hands from Reconstruction until last year, Mr. Fisher's campaign literature features a picture of him with a smiling Mr. Clinton at the White House. If Mr. Fisher wins the nomination he will next face Mrs. Hutchison, who was recently acquitted on charges she had misused her former State Treasurer's post.
 
Democrat in His Heart
 Though he resolutely declines to say whom he voted for in the most recent Presidential election, only that it was not Mr. Bush, Mr. Fisher insists that in his heart he has always been a Democrat. Even when he worked for Mr. Perot, he adds, his real goal was to spur the Democrats to change.
"This is the major gut issue -- how do we rejuvenate my party?" he said in an interview. "We have lost all the small-business women and men in Texas. We've scared them away. That's been the backbone of our party. We've scared away the ranchers and the farmers. We're losing the up-and-coming professional classes."
Mr. Fisher, a Harvard-, Stanford- and Oxford-educated economist who grew wealthy managing rich clients' money and boasts that he can out-rope anybody who has run for the office, dismisses suggestions that he has ever betrayed his party roots.
"The old definitions of liberal-conservative, even Republican-Democrat, are being blurred," he said. "I do believe in the Jeffersonian-Jackson creed. That's the foundation of my party. I believe it has to be brought to the age of Clinton and Gore and beyond. I think the President has struggled with that himself."
As for his contributions to several candidates in the crowded Democratic Presidential field of 1988, he says, "I knew practically every dog in that hunt." Dick and Jane Gephardt slept at his house once, Paul Simon was a friend of his father-in-law's, and Gary Hart had jokingly promised to make him Treasury Secretary.
Mr. Fisher emphasizes decidedly new-Democratic themes, like welfare reform. Many Democrats have argued that Mr. Fisher, less liberal that Mr. Mattox, would be a stronger candidate in the general election.
 
'He's Bob Roberts'
 Still, he has clearly had to battle criticism that he is simply riding with the political winds.
"Fisher is like a parody of what's wrong with politics," Molly Ivins, the Texas writer, scoffed in her syndicated column recently. "He's Bob Roberts, he's Bob Forehead. He doesn't stand for anything, he doesn't believe in anything, he just goes around saying buzzwords like 'job creation' and 'the future.' "
Mr. Fisher stunned Texas's political world when he finished just behind Mr. Mattox in the March 8 primary, 41 percent to 38 percent, forcing the runoff next Tuesday. The man who had fashioned himself as Mr. Bentsen's political heir, Michael A. Andrews, a moderate Houston Congressman, was forced out of the race. Mr. Bentsen had resigned the seat to become Treasury Secretary.
Many political experts here think that Mr. Fisher is the favorite to win the runoff because he has more appeal to Mr. Andrews's voters than does Mr. Mattox and has more money to spend in the closing days. In the battle over the heavily Democratic vote in South Texas, Mr. Fisher, who spent part of his childhood in Mexico and Spain, uses commercials featuring him speaking fluent Spanish. He swept nearly all the border counties in the March vote.
Other experts, however, say the turnout on Tuesday will be heavy with hardcore Democrats, sometimes called the "Yellow Dog Democrats" because they would rather vote for a canine than any Republican, who would tend to vote for Mr. Mattox.
 
'Tricky Primary Message'
 "Fisher's got a great general-election message, but it's a tricky primary message," said Mark McKinnon, a Democratic consultant in Austin who is not working for either candidate.
And that is why Mr. Mattox has been hammering away at Mr. Fisher's party credentials. "He really is a Republican and a political opportunist with absolutely no loyalty to the Democratic Party," said the 50-year-old Mr. Mattox.
The campaign has been venomous. Mr. Mattox has all but called Mr. Fisher a racist for belonging to a Dallas country club that has no black members. And Mr. Fisher has reminded voters that Mr. Mattox, in his 1990 campaign for governor, made unsubstantiated accusations that Ann W. Richards, the ultimate victor, had once been treated for cocaine abuse.
Mr. Fisher says he is steeled for criticism.
Every morning, he said, "when I wake up and I look in the mirror, I know who I am. And I say a little-bitty chant. I got it from Marian Wright Edelman, by the way. When she gave a speech -- she didn't give it to me personally.
" 'If you're afraid of criticism, don't say anything, don't do anything, and don't be anything.' I swear, every time I enter into a debate or I get up in the morning, I chant that to myself, because I know I am going to be heavily criticized."

HEADLINE: Hispanic Families Use Alternatives to Day Care, Study Finds

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA 

 BODY:
Hispanic families use preschools and day care centers much less than those of other ethnic groups, apparently because of cultural preferences for family-like care, a new Harvard University study says. This finding, the study's authors say, suggests that government should be putting more child-care money into programs like vouchers that accommodate parental choices rather than concentrating on preschool programs like Head Start.
The researchers at Harvard's Graduate School of Education found that among families with a mother employed full time outside the home, 32 percent of the Hispanic families surveyed placed children in preschools or day care centers, compared with 55 percent of the black families and 43 percent of the white families surveyed. 
 Many Hispanic families appear to be deliberately avoiding such care; in a previous study researchers found no shortages of preschools or day care centers in counties with large Hispanic populations. The new research indicates that Hispanic families often prefer asking relatives to watch their children or placing youngsters in family day care, in which one person watches a number of children in a home.
"This raises questions about the progressive, liberal view that it's better to have institutionalized care," said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at Harvard and one of the study's four authors, who will present the results next week at an education meeting in Seattle.
 
Questions of Discrimination
 Professor Fuller suggested that President Clinton's campaign pledge to expand Head Start to serve all eligible children might discriminate against some Hispanic families. "If we put all our eggs in the Head Start basket, it will economically penalize parents who prefer non-Head Start arrangements," he said.
Professor Fuller advocates spending more government money on vouchers, so that parents can buy the kind of child care they want, and improving the quality of family day care. Conservative groups led a successful drive to include vouchers in the 1990 child-care block grants.
Head Start officials challenged Professor Fuller's recommendations. Most educators believe that preschool prepares children for elementary school. "To be successful, you've got to know and be exposed to all cultures and values," said Sarah Greene, the chief executive officer of the National Head Start Association. "That's what Head Start's about: giving minority groups exposures they might not otherwise have."
Many Hispanic families do enroll in Head Start programs. Gregg Powell, Head Start's director of research and evaluation, said that of the 713,903 children in Head Start in the fiscal year 1993, 24 percent were Hispanic, 36 percent black and 33 percent white.
 
Family Preferences
 But other child-care experts said the study bolstered their belief that government policies need to accommodate family preferences. "On this one, I think the conservatives were right, and even this Administration seems to accept that," said Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "It may not only be the most financially efficient, but may be the most socially appropriate approach."
In fact, President Clinton has called for increased financing for both child-care block grants and Head Start, although the Head Start increase would be larger.
The research may also contribute to the debate about overhauling the welfare system, because Hispanic mothers on welfare may resist taking jobs when their children are young or try to avoid placing those children in formal day care centers, Professor Fuller said.
The Harvard study drew on a survey of families with children ages 3 to 5 conducted in 1991 by the National Center for Education Statistics, a research arm of the Department of Education. Using a national sample of 5,095 families, the Harvard researchers re-analyzed the data to examine what influenced choices of child care. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
 
Education Level a Factor
 The researchers found that two-parent families and families with relatives living in their households tended to use day care centers less than other families surveyed. Hispanic families were more likely than black families to be two-parent households (75 percent versus 45 percent) and were more likely than white families to have relatives living with them.
More important in the choice of day care were parents' education levels and their emphasis on early literacy. The better educated the parents, the more likely they were to place their children in preschools, the researchers found, and compared with black or white parents, fewer Hispanic parents had any post-secondary education. Hispanic parents were also less likely than white parents to read to their children once a day or visit the library with them.
But a cultural preference for keeping children in a warm and family-like atmosphere seemed to play a large role in Hispanic families' choice of day care, an analysis of the data showed. To gain insight into this issue, the Harvard researchers conducted in-depth interviews with four Hispanic families over two years, a sample too small to be reliable, yet still suggestive to policymakers.
 
'A Kind of Foreign Turf'
 The families said, for example, that they found many day care centers or preschools too formal and cold. Some said they chose family day care because they thought it would enable them to build a more personal relationship with the person caring for their children. And some families said they preferred to keep their children in a Spanish-speaking, or at least a bilingual, environment when they were young.
"The reasons parents gave are very indicative of the problem," said Elizabeth Weiser Ramirez, an official of Aspira, an organization that serves Hispanic youth. "They say, in essence, that a day care center is a kind of foreign turf."
Professor Fuller noted, "The evidence does suggest that the learning gains for kids are going to be higher in quality preschools." But he added, "I don't think anyone's taking into account how these may erode the more indigenous ways of raising kids."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Longtime Hewlett Executive Named Novell Chief

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 5

 BODY:
Novell Inc. today named Robert J. Frankenberg to succeed Raymond J. Noorda as chief executive.
Mr. Frankenberg, who is 46, has spent his entire 25-year career at the Hewlett-Packard Company, most recently as the head of its personal computer business. He takes command of Novell at the most challenging time since Mr. Noorda turned the struggling start-up company around a decade ago. 
 Mr. Frankenberg was named president and chief executive, not chief operating officer, as previously reported; Mr. Noorda, who will turn 70 in June, continues as chairman.
The company is dissolving its office of the president, whose former members, Mary M. Burnside, chief operating officer, and James R. Tolonen, chief financial officer, will continue their responsibilities and report to Mr. Frankenberg.
 
News Broadly Leaked

Shares of Novell rose $1.50, to $18.375, in Nasdaq trading today in anticipation of the announcement. Although Novell released its announcement after the close of the market, it had been broadly leaked.
In addition to the market's decline over all, Novell shares had been pounded in recent weeks by investor uncertainty about the company's $1.5 billion acquisition of the Wordperfect Corporation and the Quattro Pro spreadsheet product of Borland International Inc.
Long the leader in software for connecting personal computers on networks, Novell has, through those acquisitions, put itself in more direct competition with the Microsoft Corporation in application programs, like word processors and spreadsheets, and operating systems, which control basic computer and network functions.
Although speculation about Mr. Frankenberg's joining Novell had appeared in the trade press for months, he and Mr. Noorda said in a telephone interview that serious discussions about the move had begun just three weeks ago. That was before the Wordperfect deal, which Mr. Frankenberg said he "very enthusiastic about."
"For me, it was a pivotal item in my decision to join Novell because it makes possible an entirely new category of networked applications which no one else can provide," he said.
As general manager of Hewlett-Packard's personal information products group, Mr. Frankenberg is credited with having revived the company's struggling personal computer unit. He has been the company's liaison with Novell on various partnerships and joint projects.
"He'll bring an understanding of how to deal with big corporate customers, which Novell needs, as well as a lot of understanding of mobile computing, which will be important to Novell's future," said Heidi Dix, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "He does have his work cut out for him; Novell has done a lot of stuff lately but they haven't been real good at following through."
Even before the controversial deal for Wordperfect, Novell was straining to rationalize its acquisition in June 1993 of Unix Systems Laboratories from A.T.& T. in a stock swap valued at about $320 million. While presenting Unix, long the preferred operating system software for technical computing, as an "open" alternative to Microsoft's dominant MS-DOS and Windows, Novell gave the rights to the Unix name and specifications to an industry consortium.
 
Core Product Under Attack
 At the same time, Novell's core product, the Netware operating system, has come under fresh attack by Microsoft's Windows NT, a new operating system with networking.
Large customers have deferred moving to the latest version of Netware, but that reflects not so much the impact of Windows NT than the difficulties inherent in a big systems software upgrade. As a result, Novell earnings have disappointed Wall Street analysts for several quarters. Write-offs associated with Novell's acquisitions resulted in a net loss of $35 million in the 1993 fiscal year, which ended on Oct. 30.
"Bob's a superb manager, but he's walking into a real quagmire because of Ray's decision to try to go head to head with Microsoft," said Rich Edwards, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Company, who worked with Mr. Frankenberg at Hewlett-Packard from 1975 to 1983.
Although Novell's somewhat unusual corporate culture stresses cooperation with competing companies and explicitly places customers' and employees' interests ahead of shareholders, Mr. Noorda said he thought his successor would have no problem fitting in.
"We've always modeled ourselves after Hewlett-Packard," he said. "I and Novell have long had a good relationship with Bob and with H.P. in general."
Mr. Frankenberg joined Hewlett-Packard in 1969 as a manufacturing technician and got a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from San Jose State University in 1974. He is married, with two children.

HEADLINE: Hope Offered on Wider Use of Alzheimer's Drug

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 5

 BODY:
Many Alzheimer's patients who find they cannot tolerate the only drug approved for treating the disease may be able to use it if they stop taking it briefly, then start again, researchers report.
Liver abnormalities developed in 29 percent of patients who took the drug, tacrine, but the disorders disappeared a few weeks after the drug was stopped, the researchers said. Their findings appear in the issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association being published on Wednesday. 
 In 87 percent of the patients who then began taking the drug again, the abnormalities never returned, said the study, which was led by a clinical scientist for the drug's maker, the Warner-Lambert Company.
The study of tacrine involved 663 patients with mild to moderate cases of Alzheimer's disease. It found small but meaningful benefits in thinking skills among some patients taking the drug compared with patients who received a dummy drug.
Tacrine only sets the clock back on the advance of Alzheimer's disease by about six months, however. After that, decline continues.
"Improvement, it needs to be emphasized, appears to be temporary," said Dr. Barry Reisberg, a member of the medical and scientific advisory board of the Alzheimer's Association. He was not involved in the study.
Tacrine, the only treatment for Alzheimer's disease, was approved in September by the Food and Drug Administration. Warner-Lambert said 50,000 to 60,000 patients are taking the drug.
More than one-third of the study's patients quit taking tacrine because of the side effects, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, as well as the liver abnormalities. But many were able to resume taking it later, sometimes at lower levels, according to the study.
"The majority of patients can tolerate it," said Margaret J. Knapp, a clinical scientist with the Parke-Davis division of Warner-Lambert.
Dr. Knapp led the study, which formed the basis for F.D.A.'s approval of tacrine. Results had not been made public previously, she said at a news conference today at the Williams Club in Manhattan.
 
No Permanent Damage
 A separate study, also published in The Journal of The American Medical Association and led by Dr. Paul B. Watkins of the University of Michigan, found that no permanent liver damage resulted from taking tacrine.
Still another study found a correlation between Alzheimer's and economic status. It suggested that people with higher educational and job levels may have a reduced risk.
The highly educated may have more "reserves" of skills or coping mechanisms that could delay the disease, said the researchers, who were led by Yaakov Stern of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

HEADLINE: Weak Canadian Dollar Raises Rates, Limits Jobs

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 5

 BODY:
Though Canada may deserve plaudits for its low inflation rate, a plummeting Canadian dollar has forced interest rates higher, threatening recovery from the double-digit unemployment lingering after the country's most severe recession since World War II.
The currency's dive to its lowest point in almost eight years mainly reflects growing nervousness over the Canadian Government's ability to control the ballooning public debt. 
 The risk of secession by Quebec is also rattling foreign investors. If separatists, whom polls now strongly favor, win province elections this year, there is concern that they could persuade a majority of Quebecers to say yes to sovereignty for the province in a referendum.
 
Bank Economist Is Vexed
 "Canada's chronic dependence on foreign capital to finance bloated payment shortfalls leaves the financial markets very exposed to sudden shifts in investor confidence," said Aron Gampel assistant chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
On Monday, the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar fell to 71.60 cents, its lowest point relative to American currency since August 1986. It recovered slightly today to 72.34 cents, still about 3 cents below its value at the beginning of March. By contrast, the Canadian dollar was worth nearly 90 cents at the end of 1991.
As a result, interest rates, including those for mortgages and installment payments for cars and home appliances, have jumped one to two percentage points since early March.
Although rates have also climbed in the United States, the rise has been more dramatic in Canada because it depends more on foreign capital to finance its deficits.
As a percentage of the gross domestic product, both the balance-of-payments and the budget deficits in Canada are running twice as high as comparable American deficits.
Canada's reliance on foreign borrowing, chiefly from the United States, to finance national health, unemployment insurance and other domestic programs has caused the level of foreign debt to rise two-and-a-half times since the early 1980's.
Foreign debt stood at 252.8 billion Canadian dollars by the end of 1993, representing 8,792.61 Canadian dollars for every person in this country, more than three times the American foreign debt on a per-capita basis.
Canada has one of the lowest inflation rates in the world. At 1.8 percent, it is half that of the United States. Yet Canadians -- saddled with their huge debt, which is now raising questions of creditworthiness -- must pay one to two percentage points more to borrow money than Americans.
Many critics blame the Liberal Government's budget, announced by Finance Minister Paul Martin on Feb. 22. for the lack of deep spending cuts. Major retrenchment occurred only in defense, which is not a big consumer of Canadian dollars.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at the investment firm of Burns, Fry, echoing the view of many on Bay Street, Toronto's and Canada's financial center, said the currency weakness "is reflective of a loss of confidence in our Government's ability to significantly reduce the budget deficit."
Mr. Martin projected a budget deficit in the new fiscal year, which began on April 1, at 39.7 billion Canadian dollars, down from 45.7 billion in the year just ended. But the increased yields of Canadian Government bonds and Treasury bills since February have already forced a rise of a billion to two billion Canadian dollars in annual debt-servicing costs, wiping out much of the expected savings.
Mr. Martin says his budget was intended to withstand the sort of volatility that has shaken the currency market. "We are on track for our deficit targets," he recently said in the House of Commons, saying there is "sufficient room to maneuver."
Most economists from private business do not agree. They say the overall federal debt of 570 billion Canadian dollars translates almost immediately into enormous added interest costs. Every rise of one percentage point in interest rates adds about 1.7 billion Canadian dollars to the deficit.
Mr. Martin wants to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of the gross domestic product by 1996. In the fiscal year that just ended, the deficit was 6.4 percent of G.D.P., compared with 3.9 percent in the United States.
 
Bond Raters Displeased, Too
 Canada's financial imbroglio has not escaped the notice of bond-rating services, three of which have downgraded Canadian debt. The latest to do so was the Toronto-based Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd. Dominion lowered Canada's foreign-currency debt rating to AA from AAA. In a statement explaining its action, it said that if Mr. Martin wanted the AAA rating restored, "meaningful expense reductions must be achieved."
The Canadian Bond Rating Service Inc. of Montreal a year ago lowered all Federal debt to AA+ from AAA. In October 1992, Standard & Poor downgraded the foreign currency debt from AAA. Moody's Investors Service still regards all Canadian Government debt as triple A.
The higher interest rates needed to attract money from abroad compound the problems of reducing the deficit and put a brake on consumption, which could derail Canada's fragile economic recovery.
The five-month-old Liberal Cabinet had counted on economic growth to put Canadians back to work. Although by economists' measurements, the recession officially ended in 1992, Canada still has more than 11 percent unemployment, compared with 6.5 percent in the United States.
A positive element is the help that the cheaper Canadian dollar is giving to exports, especially goods sold in the United States. Canada's American trade surplus is at a record $15.8 billion, although its deficit with the rest of the world lowers the overall surplus to $8.6 billion. To balance all its international accounts, including interest payments, Canada would need a trade surplus of more than $25 billion, at the current exchange rate.
The decline in the Canadian dollar is felt by businessmen like Serge Racine, chief executive of Shermag Inc., a furniture manufacturer in Sherbrooke, Quebec. Mr. Racine's business last year increased its sales 90 percent, and this year he projects a further gain of 50 to 60 percent, chiefly as a result of American business.
But Mr. Racine talks about "imported inflation," because Shermag buys hardwood lumber and fabric in the United States for its dining room and bedroom sets.
"We don't want the dollar rate getting too low," he said, "because then our costs start really going up."

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
The Clintons' Health Care Nemesis: The Man Behind 'Harry and Louise'

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
In the history of the health care wars, "Harry and Louise" may well go down as the killer yuppies.
The couple, 40-something suburbanites fretting about big changes in health care in an advertising campaign for the Health Insurance Association of America, are now widely viewed as one of the most effective attacks to date on the Clinton health plan. To the Administration and its allies, the ads symbolize an industry desperately fighting change -- and willing to terrify the public to do so. 
 But the man who brought the public the $10 million "Harry and Louise" campaign, Bill Gradison, the president of the Health Insurance Association of America, says he sleeps very well at night, thank you.
Mr. Gradison, an amiable former Congressman from Ohio who specialized in health issues during his 18 years in the House -- and who was widely considered a good guy by advocates of health care restructuring -- refuses to be cast as the arch-enemy of reform.
In perhaps a commentary on modern political life, Mr. Gradison said that he cares deeply about health care and wanted to be a player in its restructuring but that he had to leave Congress and become a lobbyist to do so.
 
He Sees a Broad Fight
 Serene in his archetypal corner office overlooking the legal and lobbying canyons of Connecticut Avenue, he contends that his organization is simply trying to prevent a disastrous health plan from being inflicted on the American public -- and the American insurance industry.
Mr. Gradison says his organization was ignored by the White House as the Clinton plan was being developed. Later, he says, it was accused of "everything but child abuse" when the Clintons took their plan to the public.
"We're big boys; we can deal with this," he said. "But they seem to prefer us to have as an enemy." Mr. Gradison said he "regrets that it was necessary" to unleash the anxious yuppies, but with a set of "survival issues" at stake, he argues, his group had no choice.
"Being in the Rose Garden is not our objective," he said, referring to the ceremony site where all the favored parties gather to celebrate the signing of a bill into law. "It's getting a workable bill to insure that every American is covered by private health insurance."
These days, every interest group trying to influence the health care bill faces similar decisions. Should they quietly keep trying to change the Administration's mind, mount a tough campaign aimed at the public, concentrate on the relevant Congressional committees? Nobody wants to be on the wrong side of history, but, as Mr. Gradison suggests, nobody wants to be standing in the Rose Garden next fall, picking up souvenir pens from the signing of a bill they hate.
 
All-Out Attack
 Amid all this delicate maneuvering, the Health Insurance Association has become an exemplar of the empty-the-missile-silos approach.
Mr. Gradison and his organization have been chastised by former Congressional colleagues -- "in public, yes, but not in private," he says, a tad defensively -- assailed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, even parodied by the Clintons at a recent Washington dinner as "the Coalition to Scare Your Pants Off."
"H.I.A.A. has clearly been the pit bull in the fight against health care reform," says Paul Begala, political adviser to the White House. Senator Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat and Clinton ally who is also a staunch advocate of health care restructuring, said: "I think the role they've played has been significant, and I think it's been destructive. He's done damage, and nobody's had the money to counter it."
In a recent interview, Mr. Gradison seemed more the moderate, reasonable Republican than the pit bull from inside the Beltway. He noted that his organization totally supported the President's goal of "guaranteeing private health insurance" for every American.
"The notion that the Government is going to come along and require people to buy what we have to sell is rather appealing," he said, "as long as it's set up on a basis that permits us to stay in those markets and be able to raise the capital and go out there and compete."
 
Critics See Transparency

Critics say the insurance industry's objections are transparent enough: It is perfectly content to sell insurance to big new markets, but wants to do so on its own terms, without an array of new rules on how much it can charge, whom it must insure and the like. Lorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the White House on health, said: "H.I.A.A. sees that the reform process is moving forward, and they want to maintain the status quo."
The Health Insurance Association has concentrated its fire on two central features of the Clinton plan. One is the regional insurance purchasing pools known as health alliances, agencies through which about 70 percent of Americans would be required to purchase their coverage. The other target is the system of price controls on insurance premiums that would be administered through the alliances.
The association's advertising has presented those alliances as a terrifying new intrusion by government into the private health insurance market, one that could limit people's choices on health care and force them to deal with a new bureaucracy. The Administration and its allies deny those accusations.
The insurance industry is not a united front behind "Harry and Louise." The biggest insurance companies are considered to be well positioned for a "managed competition" system like that envisioned by the Clinton Administration's plan. The system would concentrate the purchasing power of consumers and force health companies to vie for their business on the basis of cost and quality. Over the last few years, the five biggest insurance companies have split away from the health insurance association to pursue their own interests.
The association, on the other hand, has many small and medium-size companies among its 270 members, which might have a hard time competing in this vast, newly reorganized market.
If the aggressiveness of the association's campaign surprised Washington, the man chosen to lead it was a stunner. Mr. Gradison, first elected to the House in 1974, had just won re-election in 1992 when he announced that he was retiring to go to work for the organization. He was a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and had been the ranking Republican on its Subcommittee on Health.
 
'Dedicated to Health Care'
 "He was one of the most respected people up there -- dedicated to health care and interested in working in a bipartisan manner," said John Rother, director of legislative affairs for the American Association of Retired Persons.
Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, said, "The hard-edged position, the aggressive stand, are just not characteristic of his style as a legislator."
Speculation abounded on why he took the job, from a desire to earn more money (the Health Insurance Association will not say what his salary is) to frustration with the hard lot of trying to make policy as a House Republican in an era of seemingly permanent Democratic majorities.
William Frenzel, another longtime Republican member of the House who recently retired, said, "When you sit down with Pete Stark or Henry Waxman" -- two Democratic subcommittee chairmen -- "they say, 'How many votes have you got?' And Republicans always have to say, 'not enough.' So they roll you."
Mr. Frenzel added with a chuckle, "When Clinton said that to H.I.A.A., they said, 'O.K., we'll see you on television,' and they roughed them up a little bit."
The 65-year-old Mr. Gradison said the reasons for his shift were simple: He was at an age where "if I was going to try something new, I'd better get started on it."
He said he could see that the nation was about to get moving on health care restructuring, and he wanted to be involved. At the same time, the defeat of President George Bush, a classmate at Yale, meant that he "would not have the kind of close working relations with the White House that I had had."
 
A Player From the Outside
 He added: "I didn't leave in frustration or anything like that. I've worked a long time to try to understand health issues, and I wanted to be a player. It was that simple. If President Bush had been re-elected, I believe I would have been a player. I was less certain with this new group."
He has, in fact, become a player. His advertising campaign has had such an effect that there is talk of a backlash. The last "Harry and Louise" round of commercials finished up about a month ago, and there are no plans for a reprise. "We're encouraged that on our issues we're making progress," he said, "and that's all we're trying to do."
He added: "Our worst fear would be no action. We want legislation passed. We'd like to know the ground rules for competition. It's a little hard to be in this business with plans floating around ranging from ones that would put you out of business entirely to ones that would put you at the tender mercies of some new state agency, which is mandatory alliances."

HEADLINE: Cherokee Losing Chief Who Revitalized Tribe

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TAHLEQUAH, Okla., April 5

 BODY:
Wilma P. Mankiller, who is widely credited with revitalizing the Cherokee Nation in the last 10 years, has announced that she is resigning as the tribe's principal chief.
During her tenure as head of the second-largest nonassimilated tribe in the United States, after the Navajo, Chief Mankiller appeared before Congressional committees dozens of times, met with three Presidents and established herself as one of the premier authorities on Indian affairs. 
 The 48-year-old chief told about 500 tribal employees on Monday that she would not seek re-election next year.
"Almost all of my life I've been blessed with the ability to know when it's time to make a change," she said. "I've come to the point where I feel certain that it's time for another change for myself and the Cherokee Nation."
 
A Time to Every Purpose
 After citing the biblical passage, "To every thing there is a season," she added, "My season here is coming to an end."
Ms. Mankiller cut her speech short when employees began crying, and she, too, wept when employees rose to their feet in applause and met her with handshakes and hugs.
When Ms. Mankiller began working for the Cherokee Nation in the 1970's, after participating in the occupation of Alcatraz island in 1969, the tribe had fewer than 10,000 members.
She was elected deputy chef in 1983 and became the first woman to lead the tribe when she was appointed chief in 1985. She was elected to a four-year term in 1987 and re-elected with 83 percent of the vote in 1991.
 
Evidence of Growth
 During her tenure, membership increased from 55,000 to 156,000 and the number of tribal employees nearly doubled, to 1,271. The budget is $86 million, up from $44 million in 1986. The tribe added three health centers and nine children's programs.
She has testified before Congress on issues ranging from Indian sovereignty to health care.
Ms. Mankiller said she would stay active in Indian affairs. "You don't have to have a title or a position to be effective," she said.
After taking part in the Alcatraz occupation -- a failed attempt by Indians to gain title to the island, which had been the site of a Federal prison -- Ms. Mankiller left California in 1977 to return to Cherokee land.
With no money, car or job, she started as a volunteer and later headed economic and community development programs before becoming deputy chief.
Ms. Mankiller was severely injured in an automobile accident in 1979 and underwent 17 operations. She also suffers from myasthenia gravis, a disease of the nervous system, and underwent a kidney transplant in 1990. But she said her health was not a factor in her decision to retire.

As the Clinton Administration weighs whether to revoke China's preferential trade status and whether to impose trade sanctions on Japan, a new factor is creeping into its calculations: What impact would such moves have on already volatile global stock and bond markets?
The diplomacy of the stock market is an increasingly important calculation for American officials. Fifteen years ago, the impact of a foreign policy decision on the stock and bond markets might only have been a small consideration. But now it is being taken much more seriously. 
 This is because American interest rates, growth rates and pension funds are more directly tied to Asian and European economies and their financial markets. A foreign policy decision in Washington can affect investors in Asia, which then reverberates on Wall Street and Main Street. This linkage is especially on the minds of Administration officials as the world's markets gyrate wildly, as they have in recent weeks.
"Whenever you have this kind of instability it creates caution and conservatism in decision makers," David Hale, the chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, said. "There is so much integration now, everyone is terrified of being blamed for causing a global stock market crash."
Already, some American officials shudder at the thought of what they would do if today, and not June 3, were the day President Clinton had to decide whether to extend China's most-favored-nation trade status -- knowing that a revocation would set off political and economic shock waves that could slash a few hundred points from the Dow.
While Administration officials insist that how China handles human rights remains the paramount consideration in deciding whether to renew Beijing's trade benefits, clearly the impact of such a move on financial markets has to gnaw at them.
"You cannot have tensions with your biggest supplier of foreign capital -- Japan; the biggest country in the world -- China, and the area of the world that is right now the most dangerous -- the Korean peninsula -- without it having a significant negative effect on markets," Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said.
 
Dealing With Japan
 Many analysts feel that stock market diplomacy is already apparent in Administration dealings with Japan, where President Clinton has quietly told aides he wants to maintain a low-noise-level approach to persuading Japan to open its markets.
The American intelligence community has recently provided the President with a series of analyses on Japan, arguing that underlying, long-term political trends there are toward a more open, consumer-oriented and deregulated society -- the kind Mr. Clinton wants.
The President intends to keep the pressure on Tokyo to open more markets, aides say. But he apparently does not want to do it with high-profile sanctions that rattle the Dow, Nikkei and European stock exchanges. Rather, he seems to prefer raising the value of the yen against the dollar -- thereby making all of Japan's exports more expensive and harder to sell -- just enough to make sure that the Japanese business community keeps pressing the Japanese Government to take more market-opening actions.
But Mr. Clinton clearly wants to proceed in a "measured way," aides say, so as not to upset the trend of events in Japan, either by sparking a trade war or by destabilizing the currency and bond markets so that Japan cannot climb out of its recession.
 
A Sense of the Interplay
 Indeed, stock market diplomacy seems to come naturally to Mr. Clinton, who may not have much of a feel for traditional diplomacy, like arms control or Bosnia, but clearly has a strong intuitive grasp of the interrelationship between global markets and political trends.
As Japan's Ambassador to the United States, Takakazu Kuriyama, put it: "He understands international economics and the interaction between domestic and international policy better than any President I have seen."
In addition, Mr. Clinton's whole foreign policy vision is based on the notion that global economic growth will be the engine for growth in the United States and other industrialized democracies. All the more reason, then, for the President to keep one eye cocked on the markets, as he decides on Japan and China.
"You don't have to explain it to him," said a top Administration foreign policy official. "Even during the campaign he would ask how the markets were reacting to this or that event."
But while acknowledging that fact, aides insist up and down that the President will make his decisions on Japan and China with a lot more than just the Dow on his mind.
 
'A 24-Hour Money Cycle'
 The impact on global markets "will not be the determining factor" in Mr. Clinton's decisions on China and Japan, said George Stephanopoulos, Presidential adviser. But, he added, "When you are having the policy discussion about these issues, one of the talking points you have to address is the market-impact question."
"Just as you have a 24-hour news cycle, now you have a 24-hour money cycle," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "And just as with the news cycle, if you have traders going around the clock with access to markets around the world, policy makers can literally never rest. You have to be ready to respond at anytime.
"But just as we learned with the news cycle, you can't overreact to it either. Everything gets bounced around and washed through much more quickly."
Clearly, though, the linkages cannot be ignored. It was the threat of a United States-Japan trade war in February, after trade negotiations had collapsed, that drove the value of the yen up and the dollar down. A depreciation of the dollar, whether across the board or against one major currency, tends to push interest rates higher, because the cheaper dollar forces the Government to offer higher interest rates to attract foreign capital to buy its Treasury bills and finance the deficit. Higher bond prices drove down the stock market.
At the time, traders say, Japanese finance ministry officials hinted that they would not rule out heavy selling by the Japanese of American bonds, which could exacerbate the situation. It was a subtle reminder to Washington that two can tango when it comes to applying financial pressure. It was also a reminder that in today's financial markets, what goes around comes around.
"Let's face it," Mr. Hormats said, "the guy who holds a mortgage in Paducah, his interest rate depends on whether Japanese investors buy American bonds. And the guy whose pension fund is partially invested in Asia will be affected by what the President does with China."

Vigorous Rally in Bonds Halts Run of Down Days

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The bond market's stunning reversal yesterday, which pushed bond prices back up to last Friday's levels, may be a sign that the current down cycle is running out of steam.
The prices of Treasury securities moved sharply higher after a firm opening, on what market analysts described as retail buying and "short covering" by speculators who had bet that prices would keep dropping. The gains came after two trading sessions that saw prices plunge and interest rates jump to 15-month highs. 
 For days traders and dealers had been aware that the market was oversold, a message that may have attracted some buyers yesterday.
 
Some Tempered Optimism
 "The other side of de-leveraging was undoubtedly going on today," Walter S. Frank, chief economist for The Bond Fund Report in Ashland, Mass., said yesterday. "And while it's a little too early to say that the selling is over and rates are going to be coming down in a straight line, the rates we saw yesterday could well turn out to be the highs for the year."
Many market participants said the bond market's activity had little to do with economic reality, Mr. Frank said.
"You had a market that was highly leveraged and quite rickety, but we didn't know it," he said. The slight tightening of interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board on Feb. 4 should have drawn a mild reaction from the bond market, but instead caused it to fall sharply, he said. No one knew the point at which the selling would cease, he said, because the market was not being driven by fundamental pressures.
But Mr. Frank said those speculative pressures were easing and he doubted that "we'll see them again in this interest-rate cycle, with yields coming back to levels consistent with the underlying economic realities and substantially lower than what we have today."
He then added a warning: "It won't be quick. A lot of damage has been done in the market and the scars need to heal."
By late in the day, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up 126/32 , to 882/32 , with a yield of 7.24 percent, down from 7.41 percent on Monday.
 
A Partial Comeback
 Until yesterday the long bond had shed more than 3 1/2 points in two days, or about $35.63 for every $1,000 of bonds held. But by the close of the New York cash market yesterday, investors had recouped about $18.13 of that.
Market analysts said the recent declines in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity futures prices and falling gold prices suggested that investors' fears of inflation might be exaggerated, and that may have given the bond market some support yesterday.
The market was also given encouragement by the European bond markets, which resumed trading yesterday after a long Easter weekend. Traders said that while bond prices were down in most markets, the losses were not as big as those that have rattled the Treasury bond markets in recent days.
Some analysts said the resilience of the European markets could mean that they were separating themselves from the United States market, or that European investors had bet correctly that the American market would rebound.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said he had received many calls from his portfolio managers who said there was plenty of value in the market.
"Even before trading, the active managers instinctively believed that the bond market had reached an emotional extreme where it discounted all the bad news ahead that we could imagine and then some," he said. "These active bond managers were simply waiting for someone to go first, waiting for a catalyst to ignite a predictable rally."
He said it was difficult to identify the trigger for the rally yesterday. It could have been release of the index of leading economic indicators, which registered a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in February, implying that the economy would slow from the breakneck pace of the fourth quarter.
"Rarely does the index move the markets, but because the market has been so sensitive, it very well may have," Mr. Johnson said. "Or, it could have been commodity prices, which continued to decline, with the C.R.B. index down 1.64 points, to 224.38 yesterday, down from its late March high of 231."
Mr. Johnson said today's session would be crucial for the bond market and would indicate to what extent the confidence in bonds had been rebuilt. "My guess is that the bond market will stabilize until we get to important inflation numbers next week," he said. The Producer Price Index for March will be released next Tuesday, followed on Wednesday by the Consumer Price Index for March.
"The market will require good inflation numbers to rebuild confidence in the bond market another notch because that confidence has been badly shaken," Mr. Johnson said.
Economists polled by Reuters said they still expected the Fed to raise short-term interest rates during the next couple of months. Some said the central bank would wait until the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on May 17, while others said a move could come sooner.

HEADLINE: Indicators Falter, but No Big Shift Is Seen

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
The Government's chief forecasting index edged down in February to break a six-month streak of advances, but analysts generally dismissed the reading as a reflection of bad weather and said they saw no change in economic direction.
The biggest factor by far was a shrinking workweek, caused by exceptionally severe weather during the early part of February. The Labor Department's jobs report on Friday showed that the workweek expanded in March, more than making up the February decline. If the workweek had been unchanged in February, the composite index of leading indicators would have gained two-tenths of 1 percent instead of slipping one-tenth of 1 percent. 
 Although some stock market analysts cited the forecasting index as helping to fuel powerful rallies in the bond and stock markets today -- on the theory that it showed the economy not headed for inflationary overheating -- economists said anybody trading on this basis was ill informed.
"That strikes me as pretty adventurous," John P. Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said of such an interpretation.
Not only did bad weather muddy the results, he and other analysts noted, but nobody should have been surprised since nearly all the index components had been previously published and individually analyzed.
The tiny decline, the first since July, did not meet the Commerce Department's standard that a change in the index's direction must be of "significant size, duration and scope" to signal a turn in the economy.
Lincoln F. Anderson, an economist at Fidelity Management and Research, the Boston-based mutual fund group, called today's report "weather related" and probably "irrelevant" to thinking investors.
Two companion indexes, those made up of coincident and lagging indicators, also registered inconsequential changes in February. The coincident index, designed to turn at the same time as the economy, rose five-tenths of 1 percent with the help of a big rebound in personal income after the earthquake in California.
The index of components that normally move only after the economy does edged down one-tenth of 1 percent.
For the forecasting index, 6 of the 11 components contributed to February's decline, with the shorter workweek and a drop in building permits the only ones that could be regarded as sizable.
The other negatives were a lower M-2 measure of money supply, a decline in the University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations, a decline in new factory orders for consumer goods and a small drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index.
Four components made positive contributions, more or less equally. These were a rise in prices for materials especially sensitive to the business cycle, slower deliveries by corporate suppliers, a decline in first-time claims for unemployment benefits and a rise (though backlogs continued to fall) in unfilled factory orders for durable goods.
 
 
Rounding to Zero
 The 11th component, contracts and orders for plant and equipment, edged up but by so little that the Commerce Department rounded its contribution to zero.
Small revisions today raised January's rise in the forecasting index to four-tenths of 1 percent while lowering December's rise to six-tenths of 1 percent, the report also showed.
The ratio of the coincident to the lagging index -- an alternative predictor -- rose modestly in February following a small January decline.

Dollar Rallies Against Mark As Stocks and Bonds Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against other leading currencies yesterday, rising to a four-week high against the German mark, as stocks and bonds rebounded from their recent selloff.
"The buck is back," said David De Rosa, director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "There's a massive dollar-buying binge going on." 
 The dollar rose almost two pfennigs, to 1.7180 marks, in late New York trading yesterday, its highest level since March 8, from 1.7142 marks on Monday. It also rose to 104.30 Japanese yen from 103.15 yen.
Plunging stocks and bonds helped depress the dollar over the last few trading sessions. The rout in the bond market subsided yesterday and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.24 percent, from 7.41 percent on Monday. The declining interest rates helped stocks to rebound, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 82.06 points, to 3,675.41.
 
A Note of Caution on Future
 "People became more interested in buying dollars because the stock and bond markets appeared to stabilize," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Bank of Montreal.
But it is too early to say "if the dollar has turned the corner and is heading higher," said Ezra Zask, president of Ezra Zask Associates, a currency trading fund with $150 million under management. However, he added, "today's rally should make people reluctant to sell it aggressively."
Flows of capital into American stocks and bonds pushed the dollar higher, Mr. Zask said. Those flows are important to determine exchange rates now because so many currency speculators have been "blown out of the market" by huge losses, he said.
"Capital flows are driving everything right now," he said. "A lot of the speculators are on the sidelines."
Many speculators suffered when the dollar fell against other currencies in the first quarter of this year. The financier George Soros said his hedge funds lost $600 million when the dollar tumbled against the yen in February.
Concerns about the political future of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan helped the dollar gain against the yen. The yen fell after Japanese news services reported that Mr. Hosokawa was eager to resign, traders said. Mr. Hosokawa denied the reports.
The Canadian dollar also rebounded, rising from seven-year lows against the United States dollar, to 72.34 United States cents from 71.60 cents on Monday.
Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.4645 in New York from $1.4662.

HEADLINE: Japan's Surplus Barely Rises

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 5

 BODY:
Japan's current account surplus rose a modest one-tenth of 1 percent in February from a year earlier, the Government said today. The current account, the broadest measure of trade, includes goods and services.
The Finance Ministry said the current account surplus inched up to $11.94 billion in February from $11.93 billion in February 1993. 
 Japan's trade surpluses have drawn harsh criticism from the United States. Trade talks are deadlocked, with Washington arguing that Tokyo has failed to meaningfully open its markets.
The Japanese world trade surplus rose to $12.93 billion in February from $12.62 billion a year earlier.
Recession has smothered consumer demand in this country, helping to trim imports. Japan managed to limit the volume of its exports in February, but their value was higher, largely because of a stronger yen compared with the dollar. The yen has risen about 10 percent in a year.
Economists said signs of a reduced Japanese surplus might appear when the yen stopped rising against the dollar and the Japanese economy was on a firm track to recovery.

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
"BREAST is Best." This slogan promoting breastfeeding has been widely publicized. But the practice, which peaked among American mothers in 1982 after a decades-long decline, is far from commonplace.
According to periodic surveys, women who are young and unemployed, who live on low incomes and who lack college educations are the least likely to attempt to breastfeed, and if they do try, are the most likely to abandon it before their babies are 6 months old. Babies of such mothers face the highest risk of health problems that could best be countered by starting life on breast milk. 
 Even among immigrant mothers from countries where breastfeeding is nearly universal (and even when these same mothers nursed babies born when they were still living in their native land), their American-born babies are often bottle-fed.
These facts are especially discouraging to researchers who continue to uncover health-saving and possibly life-saving benefits of mother's milk to the newborn child.
But a 10-year slide in breastfeeding may be reversing, according to national surveys of tens of thousands of new mothers by Ross Laboratories, a baby formula company. In 1992, the last year for which data have been released, 53.9 percent of babies were breastfed in the hospital and 20.1 percent were still being nursed at 6 months of age. The comparable figures in 1990 were 51.5 percent in the hospital and 19 percent at 6 months, significantly lower than in 1982, when breastfeeding in the hospital peaked at 61.9 percent. A preview of the 1993 data indicates that breastfeeding is continuing to regain popularity.
Yet, the practice still lags among less affluent and less educated women, whose babies, for many reasons, including low vaccination rates and greater exposure to environmental contaminants like cigarette smoke, especially need the nutrients and disease protection that mother's milk bestows. And many affluent and well-educated mothers continue to choose bottle-feeding for reasons of convenience or, for lack of support, give up nursing as soon as any difficulty arises.
The United States is still far from the goal established in 1990 by the Department of Health and Human Services that by 2000, 75 percent of mothers nurse their babies at least in early infancy and 50 percent continue to nurse until their babies are 5 or 6 months old.
 
Obstacles to Nursing
 In Patient Care, a magazine for physicians, Dr. Carole A. Stashwick, a pediatrician at Dartmouth Medical School, recently listed these reasons for the waning of breastfeeding:
Less emphasis on its benefits in lay publications; inadequate attention to nursing by professionals involved in newborn care; direct marketing of infant formulas to mothers; the common practice of hospitals' sending new mothers home with a sample of formula, and a general failure of modern society to pass on breastfeeding skills to new mothers, most of whose own mothers and grandmothers had chosen the bottle over the breast.
Most people assume, incorrectly, that breastfeeding comes naturally. Actually, it is a learned skill for both the mother and her infant. Although babies are born with a "rooting" tendency to nuzzle the breast and with an instinct to suck, neither baby nor mother knows instinctively how to breastfeed, Dr. Stashwick wrote. First-time mothers often need help in getting started with breastfeeding, but nowadays most leave the hospital within two days of delivery, before the mother's milk even comes in. Once home, there is no one to help when breastfeeding fails to go smoothly.
The first weeks of nursing can be a challenge. Some mothers become anxious when their babies cry a lot or seem to reject the breast or lose too much weight. Some mothers' nipples become cracked or sore, and others lack support for breastfeeding from their babies' fathers or grandparents.
As one 33-year-old first-time mother put it: "Nursing seemed to be going well in the hospital, but as soon as we got home, the baby refused the breast. She began crying incessantly and wouldn't even sleep. She was obviously hungry but still refused to nurse. So I gave up, and as soon as I gave her a bottle, she was happy."
The mother said that at the hospital, "three different people gave me conflicting advice: hold the baby this way, hold her that way, feed on demand, feed on a schedule, never give her a bottle, supplement with formula if she still seems hungry."
Then, too, there are important socioeconomic obstacles. Many new mothers must return to work -- sometimes within weeks and often within three months of the birth -- and decide, again mistakenly, that there is no point in nursing for so short a time. And in the case of mothers receiving Federal aid under the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), infant formula is provided for those who bottle-feed, and additional foods but no monetary supplement are offered to those who nurse.
In Quebec, to encourage breastfeeding, the comparable program now pays a cash allowance of $37.50 a month to mothers who breastfeed.
 
Nursing Successfully
 Breastfeeding specialists are founts of helpful advice. For example, it helps to change the baby's position from one feeding to another to assure that milk is drained from all areas of the breast. Besides the traditional cradling position, try a football hold, with the baby tucked under one arm so she approaches the breast from the side, or try nursing lying down face to face with the baby.
Be sure that the baby latches on to the nipple properly. The entire nipple and most of the areola (the surrounding dark area) should be in the baby's mouth and the baby's lips should spread out around it. Women with flat or inverted nipples can wear plastic breast shields called Swedish milk cups for several hours a day at the end of pregnancy and at the start of nursing to help pull out the nipple.
As the baby begins to suck, the milk is "let down" from the breast ducts into the nipple. (Often some milk drips from the opposite breast at this time.) The baby's gulping noises are an indication that milk is being swallowed. During the first days of nursing, the mother often feels brief uterine contractions when the baby begins sucking.
In a society accustomed to precise measurements, many mothers who breastfeed worry about whether their babies are getting enough to eat. A baby will mostly empty a breast in about 10 minutes of nearly continuous sucking. Those who fall asleep after a few minutes of nursing need to be awakened and kept stimulated (for example, by tapping the feet) until they have eaten enough. To maintain a good milk supply and to assure that the baby is getting enough, newborns should be nursed every two to three hours.
Success at nursing can be measured by whether the baby seems content afterward, produces at least six wet diapers and several fairly liquid, mustard-colored stools each day and wakes up at least every four hours around the clock to be fed. A baby who is gaining weight normally is well fed, but experts advise against home baby scales, which are often inaccurate and can be anxiety-provoking instead of reassuring.
 
Sources of Support
 Breastfeeding is most likely to succeed when both mother and father are well informed. Many hospitals now have lactation specialists on staff; be sure to leave the hospital with a phone number to call if nursing difficulties begin at home. The hospital specialist may also be able to refer you to a local breastfeeding support group. Other useful resources include the following:
La Leche League International, 9616 Minneapolis Ave., Franklin Park, Ill. 60131; phone (800) LA LECHE (525-3243) or (708) 455-7730.
International Childbirth Education Association, Box 20048, Minneapolis, Minn. 55420; phone (612) 854-8660.
Lact-Aid International, Inc., Box 1066, Athens, Tenn. 37371; phone (615)744-9090.

How U.S. Barred Holocaust Refugees

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Since the end of World War II, evidence has accumulated that before and during the war the State Department was in effect a pioneer in Holocaust revisionism. Tonight's troubling documentary -- "America and the Holocaust: Deceit and Indifference" -- adds the power of pictures and first-hand testimony to accusations that Washington played down the known facts of Nazi persecution of Jews as a matter of policy and prejudice.
This 90-minute offering in "The American Experience" series brings home the effects of the official policy through the experience of Kurt Klein, who came to the United States in 1937 as a 17-year-old refugee from Germany, leaving his parents behind, temporarily, they hoped. As the narrator recalls the growing threat to European Jewry, from Kristallnacht in November 1938 to the death camps of the 1940's, Mr. Klein tells how his parents' efforts to flee to America were repeatedly blocked by State Department functionaries. The pictures of Jews being rounded up and herded to camps, no less painful for their familiarity, make a grim counterpoint to the fate of one family. 
 "America and the Holocaust" traces the Government's apparent indifference to the anti-Semitism of the 1920's and 30's, with the German-American Bund, the Rev. Charles Coughlin and nativist politicians leading the way. A former Treasury Department official says State Department professionals also shrugged off the plight of the refugees in deference to America's perceived economic and political interests in the Middle East. The record may stir uncomfortable thoughts about current American behavior toward refugees from despotism.
A particular villain of this account is Assistant Secretary of State Breckenridge Long, who is blamed for exaggerating security concerns in order to keep refugees out. His technique is revealed by a memorandum he wrote in 1940: "We can delay and effectively stop for a temporary period of indefinite length the number of immigrants into the United States. We could do this by simply advising our consuls to put every obstacle in the way, which would postpone and postpone and postpone the granting of the visas."
Tonight's assault relies heavily on David S. Wyman, the author in 1984 of "The Abandonment of the Jews" (Praeger), without noting that some of his broader charges, particularly against President Franklin D. Roosevelt, have been forcefully challenged by so eminent a Holocaust historian as Lucy S. Dawidowicz. Such an acknowledgment might have weakened the program's case somewhat, but it would have enhanced the reputation for scholarship of "The American Experience."
Nevertheless, few historians have anything kind to say about the "postpone and postpone and postpone" tactic. Among the many thousands of European Jews whom the narrator calls "victims of calculated, bureaucratic delay" were Kurt Klein's parents. Mr. Klein, who returned to Europe in World War II with the American Army and was one of the soldiers who found themselves freeing concentration-camp survivors, was notified after the war that in August 1942 his parents had been deported from Vichy France "in the direction of Auschwitz."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Is Not Main Street

 BODY:
The Dow Jones Industrial stock average soared more than 80 points yesterday, bringing relief to anxious investors. But the ups and downs of the stock market are more important to them than to other citizens. Even severe gyrations in the stock market often have no effect on jobs or the rest of the economy.
President Clinton points out what truly matters: The economy is expanding at a brisk pace, employers created a huge number of jobs last month, and inflation is subdued so far. The White House knows that keeping recovery alive is paramount. That is why it got upset about the recent run up in long-term interest rates. 
 Companies use long-term rates to calculate whether it makes sense to invest in new plants and equipment. If these rates were to stay high, let alone rise further, business investment could be choked off and recovery stunted.
Administration officials railed this week against high interest rates, a signal that they wanted the Federal Reserve Board to put off further rate hikes. The Fed would be wise to take heed.
The Fed raised short-term rates by a small amount (one-half percentage point total) in February and March because the economy had grown at a surprisingly brisk pace at the end of 1993 and looked poised to continue to grow quickly. The strong growth raised fears in financial markets that inflation would pick up.
Those fears would cause lenders to boost long-term rates to offset the expected inflation, thereby threatening to attenuate the recovery. The Fed hoped, by raising short-term rates early, to convince financial markets that it would not let inflation get out of hand. That way, long-term rates could stay low.
That was the theory. The markets, for unknown reasons, reacted otherwise -- driving up long-term rates despite the Fed announcement. Yet most economists and, at the time, the Administration agreed with the Fed's policy. Waiting too long to control inflation can be fatal. Once inflation rates march upward, they can be controlled only by clamping down hard on the economy; in the early 1980's, the Fed pushed the economy into a steep recession to overcome an inflationary surge.
There are experts who say the Fed's pre-emptive strike against inflation was premature. They bolster their case by pointing to data indicating the economy is not overheated. Unemployment rates, though down, still exceed 6 percent; inflation remains inconsequential, and growth has slowed since the end of last year to a modest 3 percent annual rate. For these critics, the Fed's rate hikes were unwarranted.
Whether the Fed or its critics are right is not clear. What is certain is that the Fed has acted responsibly. But the chaotic events of the past week, especially in the bond markets, should caution it against proceeding with any further rate hikes lest they have unpredictable effects.
The Fed set out in February to slow recovery from its brisk pace and, thereby, keep inflation under control. The economy has slowed; interest rates rose; prices are rising slowly. The prudent course would be for the Fed to declare tentative victory and wait before clamping down any harder.

HEADLINE: Hands Reach Out Between Communities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "A Liberalism of Heart and Spine" (Op-Ed, March 27), Henry Louis Gates Jr. proposes moving beyond a "politics of identity" to a process of "identification" among communities, with an increase in "shared humanity." I concur fully. But this process is already well under way at the grass roots. 
 Community activists such as Daniel (Nane) Alejandrez, co-director of the National Coalition to End Barrio Warfare, Marcia Choo of African-American/Korean Alliance and Fred Williams of the Los Angeles-based Cross-Colors Common Ground Foundation are working at cooperation.
The Asian Immigrant Workers Alliance enlists thousands of Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese and other workers to challenge sweatshop conditions. The Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice brings together 70 organizations including four native American nations, Chicano, African-American and Mexican communities, north and south of the border, to grapple with environmental problems. Such organizations, to name a few, are building on diverse cultural identities to create cooperation.
For me the chief defect of Dr. Gates's article is that it emphasizes group hatreds and leaves out the organizations that are constructively meeting the challenge of creating a "shared humanity."
Sadly, many academics and policy makers do not know about or work with these organizations. As Daniel Alejandrez argues, "Academics need to come down off the hill and work with community coalition efforts." Engaged scholarship requires more understanding of cooperation, as well as conflict.

To the Editor:
I was amazed at a quotation from a Lehman Brothers analyst in "Novell Acquisitions Hinge on Stock Price Fluctuation" (Business Day, March 24), concerning the networking giant's planned acquisition of the Wordperfect Corporation and the Quattro Pro spreadsheet business of Borland International Inc.: "The motto at Novell is customers first, employees second and shareholders third." 
 The analyst intends this as withering criticism of Novell. He says this motto "seems to be what this transaction is all about," and he finds "irate" Novell shareholders justified in their March 23 selloff of shares.
The American economy would be transformed if every company put customers first, employees second and owners last. I would venture to say success in the marketplace (and return on investment) ultimately depends on a company's adopting this approach.

HEADLINE: Doctor Asserts A Fall Injured Rodney King

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 6

 BODY:
A judge today allowed a doctor whose testimony was challenged in previous trials to testify that Rodney G. King's injuries came from a fall, not from blows by police clubs.
"The fractures and soft tissue injuries were most consistent with a fall, a head-in-motion injury on a flat surface," said Dr. Dallas Long. 
 He based his opinion in part on a grain of gravel that was discovered embedded in Mr. King's face weeks after he was beaten by the police.
"It would probably be the result of a head-in-motion impact on the surface where the gravel was centered, such as a roadway," Dr. Long said.
Dr. Long, of Newport Beach, Calif., acknowledged that he had never examined Mr. King and that his review of medical records had not included those of Mr. King's orthopedist.
Dr. Long's testimony was questioned in two criminal trials stemming from Mr. King's beating by police because he specializes in emergency medicine and family practice, not orthopedics or ophthalmology. Mr. King's lawyers this time sought to disqualify Dr. Long, but Judge John G. Davies of Federal District Court ruled that the doctor's examination of medical records was sufficient basis for testimony.
Dr. Long's analysis differed sharply from that of a surgeon and ophthalmologist who treated Mr. King and testified in his civil suit.
The two-phase trial is being held to determine compensatory damages owed to Mr. King by the city and punitive damages that could be levied against individuals, including the four police officers originally charged with his beating. The city offered to settle for $1.25 million; Mr. King's lawyers wanted $9.6 million.
The city, which began its defense on Tuesday, is disputing the extent of Mr. King's injuries in his beating on March 3, 1991, and the truthfulness of his testimony last week about the beating and his troubled life.
 
What He Could Have Earned
 Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. King's lawyers rested their case after calling their 18th witness, an economist, Robert Johnson, who told jurors that Mr. King could have earned more than $1.6 million during a lifetime as a construction worker or $1.3 million as a diesel mechanic.
Mr. King was on parole and set to return to a construction job at the time of the beating and was also studying to be a diesel mechanic, his lawyers said.
Outside the courtroom today, members of Mr. King's panel encountered a juror from another case who pointed them out and said: "Those are Rodney King jurors. Don't they know they're wasting taxpayers' money?"
Mr. King's lawyer, Milton Grimes, moved for a mistrial, but Judge Davies denied the motion after quizzing each juror about the incident.
"These people have the intelligence and desire to put this incident behind them and treat it for what it was, an encounter with a discourteous person," Judge Davies said.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Rise By 19.7%

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 6

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks in the United States outstripped expectations yet again in March, raising the possibility that the auto recovery may be more robust than analysts and industry executives had predicted.
With both consumer confidence and employment increasing, vehicle sales surged 19.7 percent over the March 1993 level. The Big Three auto makers all set records for one month's truck sales. Taken as a whole, car and light-truck sales for the 1994 first quarter have startled many industry analysts. 
 "I think the word stunning is appropriate, and that leaves one wondering about just how good 1994 is going to be," said Phil Fricke, auto analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "The industry would not want to see a sales blowout this year," he said. In part because some factories have closed for model change-overs, the industry may not have enough capacity to meet soaring demand in 1994, Mr. Fricke said.
 
Too Much Good News?
 In fact, such apparently good sales news could worry two groups that intently follow the auto industry: investors in auto stocks and the Federal Reserve.
Strong sales could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates further to ward off inflation. But Dave Healy, auto analyst with S. G. Warburg, pointed out that the Fed took interim March auto sales figures into account in raising rates on March 22. As a result, he predicted, the central bank was unlikely to react to today's news.
Some auto executives also said they did not expect the Fed to react. "I hope not," said J. Michael Losh, vice president and group executive for vehicle sales, service and marketing at General Motors. "One of the things I hope the Fed's primarily concerned about is inflation, and inflation seems to be in good shape."
Investors may worry that the auto market is peaking sooner than expected, meaning that the stocks would not generate the kind of earnings analysts have predicted for 1995 and 1996. "Investors would rather have a longer, gentle recovery this year, rather than have it all at once," Mr. Healy said. But, like other analysts, he argued that sales were likely to stay strong over the next two years at least.
 
Recovery Over, Boom Starts
 "I think the recovery is over, and the boom has started, but the boom is only 15 minutes old," he said.
In March, dealers sold 1,446,542 domestically built and imported vehicles, up from 1,208,036 a year ago. Car sales rose 19.2 percent, to 882,841, while sales of light trucks -- a category that includes mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickups -- rose 20.6 percent, to 563,701.
The seasonally adjusted selling rate for domestically built cars was 7.6 million, up from 7.3 million in February and 6.6 million a year ago.
The sales jump left some dealers wrestling with the kind of headache they long to have. "My inventory is so low it looks like I'm going out of business," complained Stuart Wullenweber of Wullenweber Jeep-Eagle-Chrysler-Plymouth in Cincinnati.
Mr. Wullenweber said that another dealer called him Tuesday night trying to buy one of his Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles and offering $800 over invoice. "Just think of what he's getting from the customer if he's paying $800 over invoice," Mr. Wullenweber said. Today, Mr. Wullenweber received a call from yet another dealer, this time offering $1,000 over invoice.
Mr. Wullenweber said that he had turned down both offers.
 
G.M. Car Sales Up 14.9%
 Several auto makers reported their strongest March sales in years.
At G.M., car sales rose 14.9 percent, to 299,768, while light-truck sales climbed 18.7 percent, to 185,133. "There's strength across the board," Mr. Losh said.
The recovery so far has been led by strong truck sales, but in March car sales appeared to show similar strength. But Mr. Losh said that the auto makers could not build enough trucks to keep up with demand. "We're constrained on the truck production side, so cars look stronger," he said.
Ford Motor's car sales increased 9.6 percent, to 181,210, while the company's light- truck sales rose 18.2 percent, to 167,340.
Chrysler's truck sales surged 29.4 percent, to 141,715, while the company's car sales rose 13 percent, to 88,671. It was Chrysler's best month for car sales since August 1989.
The Nissan division of Nissan Motor Corporation reported its strongest sales month in almost five years. Including sales by the luxury Infiniti division, Nissan's car sales rose 48.9 percent, to 54,233. Truck sales rose 20.7 percent, to 21,271.
The Honda Motor Company's cars sales increased 24.9 percent, to 66,158, as sales of the Accord -- available as a sedan, coupe or wagon -- shot up 46.4 percent, to 30,110.
The Toyota Motor Company's car sales in the United States rose 19.7 percent, to 76,411, while truck sales rose 7.3 percent, to 26,845.
At the Mazda Motor Corporation, car sales rose 47 percent, to 34,953, while truck sales rose 27.1 percent, to 6,192.
The Mitsubishi Motor Corporation's car sales rose 78.5 percent, to 22,374, while truck sales rose 24.8 percent, to 1,390.

HEADLINE: Derivatives Study Sought

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, called today for the Securities and Exchange Commission to study the links between the $7.5 trillion derivatives market and recent swings in the United States stock and bond markets.
Mr. Markey said in a letter to the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., that he was worried that speculators had used derivatives contracts to make huge bets on lower stock and bond prices and caused recent plunges in those markets. 
 Mr. Markey asked the S.E.C. to study "the extent to which market participants may be developing and using derivative products that may be introducing increased levels of volatility into the markets."
Derivatives are contracts whose value is tied to the price of some other asset, like a stock or a bond. They are traded over the counter by Wall Street firms that customize contracts to meet specific investment views of big institutional clients.
The market has come in for regulatory scrutiny in the last two years, because of fears that a failure by one firm to meet its derivatives payments could cause a string of defaults and ultimately a financial crisis.
Investors can buy derivatives for a fraction of the cost of trading in actual stocks or bonds. They can also use complicated derivatives contracts to raise the potential return on their bet, without putting up much extra cash.

HEADLINE: Riverboat Casinos Seek A Home in Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 6

 BODY:
Pennsylvania politicians see jobs, waterfront development and tax revenue spinning in the little windows of slot machines on riverboat casinos waiting to take their place along the state's waterways.
Using research provided by the gambling industry, these public officials say that Pennsylvania's gamblers lose $1 billion a year in Atlantic City, about 60 miles southeast of here, and that it would be better if this money were lost closer to home. Tourists who come to Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell, they add, might also liberate some cash on riverboats plying the Delaware River. 
 But fiscal experts and social scientists say the gambling industry could end up costing the state money, generate crime and, in particular, sully Philadelphia's image as the cradle of American democracy
 
Action in Legislature
 The State Legislature is considering a measure to permit gambling on Pennsylvania's navigable rivers and lakes, subject to state and county referendums, within two years. Many elected officials in the cities of Erie, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and in the suburban Philadelphia counties of Bucks and Delaware support the proposal.
Anticipating legislative approval of the bill early next year, casino owners have either bought outright, or bought options for, seven pieces of property along the Delaware River here as well as sites in Pittsburgh. Owners of waterfront properties say two dozen to three dozen gaming companies are shopping for sites around the state, creating a real estate boom along major rivers.
Riverboat gambling has already been legalized in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri. And legislatures in many other states, including New York, are considering the option.
Pennsylvania already has a state lottery and allows betting on horse races. But approval of riverboat casinos is far from certain, since Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, has vowed to veto any casino bill that he receives before his term ends next January. In addition, the bill faces strong bipartisan opposition in the state Senate, said Senator Robert C. Jubelirer, the president pro tempore of the Republican-led body.
Still, Arthur M. Goldberg, chairman and chief executive of the Bally Manufacturing Company, expressed confidence in approval of the casinos, saying, "It's just a matter of time." Indeed, industry consultants say Bally has already agreed to pay about $60 million for 31 acres on Philadelphia's waterfront south of Penn's Landing and has bought a site in Pittsburgh as well, with plans to invest $125 million in each city.
 
Words of Caution
 Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia is a leading advocate of riverboat gambling. "If you can tell me about any economic development enterprise that will employ 6,000 to 8,000 Philadelphians, give the city $300 million for the right to develop the waterfront and produce $25 million in tax revenues each year, please bring them in to see me this afternoon," Mr. Rendell said in an interview.
But fiscal experts say $25 million is not that much in a city with a $2.3 billion budget. They caution that any windfall might be gobbled up on new city services along the waterfront and in dealing with predictable increases in crime, compulsive gambling's corrosive effect on families, traffic congestion and local business failures.
They note that Atlantic City lost many retail establishments after casinos came in. For example, 97 of the city's 243 restaurants closed in 1977-87, the restaurant industry says, because of competition from casinos, which subsidize food and drinks to promote gambling.
"The idea that casinos are the answer for a state or city with serious economic development problems is a mirage," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany.
 
Fast-Growing Industry
 Gambling is one of the nation's fastest-growing industries. In 1993, industry figures show, there were 93 million visits to casinos, and industry analysts say the American market is only a third developed.
More and more states are trying to tap into an industry that takes in more than $30 billion a year. Indeed, politicians around the country say that states that do not legalize casino gambling risk being left behind with all the problems and none of the profits if casinos are built in adjacent states.
Assemblyman Wayne R. Bryant of New Jersey set the competitive tone for the Mid-Atlantic States recently when he introduced legislation calling for a state referendum on riverboat gambling on the New Jersey side of the Hudson and Delaware Rivers if Pennsylvania or New York approved riverboat gambling.
"This proposed referendum is a warning shot to Philadelphia and New York City that New Jersey will aggressively protect the Atlantic City casinos against outside competition," Mr. Bryant, a Camden Democrat, said last month at a news conference.
 
Effect on Atlantic City
 Interestingly, it is the very companies that own casinos in Atlantic City that are among those acquiring waterfront property in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Mr. Goldberg of Bally said that riverboat gambling in Pennsylvania would spur interest in Atlantic City's gambling palaces, which include two Bally casinos.
But another Atlantic City casino owner, Donald J. Trump, said in a interview that he was buying property in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh primarily to capture the business of Pennsylvanians who would stop going to Atlantic City if gaming were available closer to home.
If the Legislature does not legalize casino gambling, Mr. Trump said, he will probably build condominiums and retail stores on his 22 acres near downtown Philadelphia.
"That would probably be better for Philadelphia anyway," said Mr. Trump, who owns three casinos in Atlantic City. "Gambling would make a relatively small amount of money for Philadelphia and would increase crime and problems that aren't existent now."

Treasury Prices Mixed Amid Fear of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Government securities finished mixed yesterday in a choppy session.
Investors, still wobbly after three days of surging and plunging interest rates, attributed some of the early weakness in bonds to concerns about inflation. Those concerns stemmed from an article in The Washington Post yesterday that quoted unidentified officials of the Federal Reserve Board as having said that the Fed would delay a third increase in interest rates until the bond and stock markets had settled down. 
 Shorter-maturity bills and notes gained on the prospect that the Fed would make no immediate move.
 
Worries Over Inflation
 The possibility of a delay in a move on rates, which most market participants expect will come at the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting in May, made some investors worry that the Fed could lose its initiative in containing inflation.
Analysts said weaker-than-expected car sales in March helped the market pare some of its early losses. Late in the day, the 30-year bond was unchanged, at 882/32 , with a yield of 7.24 percent. Intermediate maturities like the three-year note traded at a price to yield 5.82 percent, down from 5.83 percent, and a 10-year note yielded 6.90 percent, down from 6.91 percent.
The three-month Treasury bill shed 10 basis points from its discounted rate, to 3.55 percent, while a one-year bill was off four basis points, to 4.44 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The market seemed to have difficulty sustaining moves in either direction, contributing to yesterday's bounce in prices. "With no new news, it was left to its own devices," one analyst said.
 
Municipals Attract Attention
 Potential buyers were wary of activity in the less liquid mortgage and municipal markets, which had caused declines recently in the price of Treasuries, as portfolio managers sold Government securities to offset losses they had incurred in other fixed-income investments as a result of higher rates. But the mortgage and municipal markets, which had tumbled with the Treasuries, are beginning to draw attention, traders said.
The long bond's failure to sustain the move below 7.25 percent in early trading put sellers in control in the morning, they added.
A few traders said the front end of the yield curve had received a slight lift after The Washington Post's article on the Fed was published. Several analysts said that for the most part, many potential buyers were still sitting on the sidelines, unconvinced that the bear market had run its course.
Tim Heathon, vice president of Nikko Securities, said, "What the Fed is going to do, or not going to do, is of no real consequence to the market, since it's already looking far, far ahead."
 
Financing for Chinese Airline
 Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, the First National Bank of Chicago, a unit of the First Chicago Corporation, and Bank of China, said they had closed on the financing for the $261 million purchase of seven Boeing 737 aircraft by China Southern Airlines.
The transaction, backed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States, is the first by a Chinese company to raise long-term funds in the United States, with support from the Export-Import Bank, officials of the Chicago bank said.
Under the arrangement, First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., also a unit of First Chicago, will underwrite $201 million of triple-A rated certificates, which will be sold to institutional investors, with the Export-Import Bank guarantee extending to $201 million.
The remaining $60 million will be financed through a syndicated loan arranged by First Chicago and the Bank of China, and guaranteed by the Government-owned Bank of China.
China Southern Airlines, based in Guangzhou, China, has 100 aircraft, including 60 Boeing jets and 40 small or medium-size planes, operating on 17 international, 19 regional and 140 domestic routes.

Auctioning off the airwaves will be a formidable undertaking.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
FOR decades, free marketeers labored to convince Congress that licenses to use the airwaves should be sold rather than given away. But now that the opposition has cracked under pressure to reduce the Federal budget deficit, true believers are beginning to realize that the job is only half done: design of the spectrum auction may prove almost as difficult as establishing the principle.
Last month the Federal Communications Commission offered tentative thoughts on how space on the spectrum for "personal communications services" -- a souped-up version of cellular phones -- would be sold. And in the view of Chuck Jackson, a communications consultant at Strategic Policy Research Inc. in Maryland, the F.C.C. has done its homework. "The caliber of input from economists was remarkably high," he concluded. But the route to a well-managed auction still has more than a few potholes. 
 Truly embarrassing missteps are unlikely, saysJohn McMillan, an economist at the University of California at San Diego, because other countries have already made them.
Consider the pioneering effort by New Zealand in the late 1980's. By one respectable (if unintuitive) theory, the best way to get bidders to reveal what winning is really worth to them is to award the prize to the highest bidder -- but charge the winner the price bid by the second-highest. That way, points out Vernon Smith of the University of Arizona, it does bidders no good to try to "game" the auction by guessing what the competition is doing and bidding just a tad higher.
New Zealand tried this "second price" strategy in the late 1980's in a sealed-bid auction for television and cellular phone licenses, only to find that in a handful of cases the second-highest bids were frivolously low -- as little as a few dollars. The moral: While the method did insure that the bidders who valued the licenses the most got them, "reserve" or minimum bids are needed to generate revenue if bidders are scarce.
Australia faced a parallel fiasco last year when it auctioned two separate licenses for direct-broadcast satellite television, only to discover that neither winner had any intention of paying the full price. Each had made dozens of bids at sequentially lower figures, with the plan of defaulting on all but the lowest figure needed to win. And since the Government had made no provision for penalties for defaults on bids, this strategy worked like a charm.
The most difficult problem faced by Washington is how to hold an auction when the value of a license depends on the ability to serve adjacent localities as well. Indeed, it is no secret that a half-dozen companies are aiming to provide nationwide service or none at all.
One solution would be to auction preassembled national packages. That, however, would close the bidding to all but the deepest pockets and preclude assembly of custom-tailored combinations intended to mesh personal communications system markets with existing cellular phone markets.
The straightforward solution would be a simultaneous auction in which all parties could bid for any or all localities, withdrawing bids as their strategies changed in response to the competition. But this might take a very long time. In fact, there would be no obvious end, since every bid could lead to a new round of bid withdrawals and rebidding.
The rules announced reflect a variety of compromises. In recognition of the interdependence problem, licenses for the largest markets will be auctioned simultaneously. Smaller markets, considered less vital in assembling networks, will be auctioned sequentially to save time and reduce complexity. But the F.C.C. is reserving the right to stop after a fixed number of rounds in the simultaneous auction. And those who withdraw bids will be forced to pay a penalty equal to the difference between the withdrawn bid and the final auction price, if the latter is lower.
Yet to be decided is how much information should be made public in the midst of the bidding. Full disclosure sounds right on general principles. But the F.C.C. staff, worried that truly transparent bidding might facilitate collusion or encourage a predator to knock a poorly financed competitor out of the game, is urging a compromise: continuing disclosure of the high bids, but not the bidders' names.
Will the auctions, likely early in 1995, be free of surprises? Probably not: the sale of rights to use technology that is changing rapidly cannot be entirely predictable.
"But don't lose sight of the big picture," cautions Peter Pitsch, a consultant and former adviser to the F.C.C. chairman. "An auction is bound to be better than the alternatives" of giving away licenses by lottery or awarding them to the best lobbyists.

HEADLINE: Making Jury Duty Less Painful and More Efficient

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
Imagine the impossible: that jury duty could be almost pleasant.
A juror who wasn't picked for trial on the first day would be excused altogether. Compensation would be raised from $15 a day to $40, as it is in the Federal courts. The summonses to serve would be fewer and further apart because the lists of people who could be called to jury duty would be nearly doubled. 
 These are among the recommendations issued yesterday by a state panel studying the overhaul of what it said was New York's clanking, inefficient jury system. The panel was appointed last summer by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye and Chief Administrative Judge E. Leo Milonas.
Many of the proposals can be put into effect administratively by Judge Kaye, while others require legislative approval. Yet if even a modest number of changes are adopted, court observers say, not only will conditions for the state's jurors be markedly improved, but also the selection of criminal and civil juries will undergo some fundamental changes.
The panel's suggestions included matters of basic comfort, like providing clean bathrooms and heating, as well as curbs on lawyers to speed jury selection.
The panel said the changes are meant to streamline the system and make participation in a jury pool feel like a valuable civic service, not an exasperating duty to be shirked by any means necessary.
In recent years, many other states have struggled to improve their jury systems, adopting some of the ideas suggested by the panel yesterday. But experts on jury systems say that the New York proposals, if put into effect, could be the most extensive overhaul in the country.
Though the panel did not try to calculate the exact costs of its proposals, it said that the increase in jurors' compensation could be partly offset by other recommendations, including ending the mandatory sequestration of felony juries.
Judge Kaye, who took over as the state's top judge last year and made the appointment of the panel her first major project, spoke glowingly about the report, calling it remarkable. Declining to list which proposals she would adopt as priorities, she said they were all of equal urgency.
She added that she would hold a 90-day comment and review period on the proposals.
Legal observers said that several proposals would face particular difficulty in the Legislature, including the abolition of occupational exemptions and the ending of mandatory sequestration.
Judge Kaye and the State Office of Court Administration can control some initiatives, however, such as authorizing some judges to supervise civil jury selection or voir dire, streamlining the summons, deferral and questionnaire procedures, and requiring county jury commissioners to move toward the one day, one trial system.
To make the juror experience more dignified, she said, an inventory of "every broken tile, every decrepit bathroom" in the state's courts had been completed and money appropriated for repairs.
One proposal by the panel that has already drawn opposition from prosecutors and defense lawyers is trimming the number of peremptory challenges that lawyers can use to strike a prospective juror.
The lawyers who handle civil suits have their backs up too. Swamped by complaints about long, querulous civil jury selection, which, unlike any other state, is run by lawyers in New York, the panel advised that judges be appointed to supervise lawyers in a pilot project.
Castigating the increasingly common and time-wasting practise of settling civil cases after a jury is picked but before the first witness takes the stand, the panel recommended that a presettlement conference just before a jury is selected be mandatory and that a $1,000 fee split by litigants be imposed if a case goes to trial.
The panel was also showered with complaints about rude and patronizing judges, lawyers and court officers, so it called for civility training for court personnel. Pointing out that courthouse conditions were less than ideal, the panel said that jurors should be entitled to such amenities as chairs with backs and seats.
 
Critical Public Comments
 The mandate of the Jury Project, headed by Colleen McMahon, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, was to find ways to make juror pools more representative of the local communities, and to make the experience of being a juror both efficient and satisfying. The 30-member commission conducted public hearings and received thousands of letters and calls. A vast majority of the comments, the report noted, were sharply critical.
Chief among them, Ms. McMahon said, was that the experience was a waste of time. "The courts can no longer view the juror pool as a drinking fountain," the report said, "ready at all times to supply attorneys and judges with a fresh flow on a moment's notice. When water sits around for too long, it becomes stagnant. The same is true for jurors."
But almost uniformly, Ms. McMahon said, high marks were given by those who actually did get to hear a case. "Jury service is painful, like childbirth," she said. "You have to make arrangements with your boss and get a sitter for the kids and there is no parking and it's raining and you walk five blocks to court and there are no chairs and you sit on the floor and you wait to be called.
"But when you get to sit on the jury and listen to the evidence, you forget all about the pain."
To reach the goal of making more jurors eligible so every juror would have to serve less time and be called less frequently, the panel made several suggestions.
In addition to motor vehicle, tax and voting lists, it said, names should be drawn from welfare and unemployment rolls. New York, which now permits more occupational exemptions than any other state, should do away with all but those for sitting state or Federal judges.
Although 90 percent of eligible names are now culled for service, perhaps only a third to a half are chosen at random. Jury commissioners rely repeatedly on that short list. To end the practice of summoning the same people again and again, the report suggested that the random list be revised annually.
The report also looked at ways to reduce the time that jurors must spend in court. Buffalo, like Philadelphia, Miami and Houston, allows jurors to be excused if they are not picked for trial on the first day. Many trials only take a few days and if a juror does get on a panel, service would conclude at verdict.
The report reserved its harshest condemnations for lawyers who pick juries merely as a threatening tactic to force a settlement. In some counties, it said, 80 to 90 percent of the civil juries were picked, sent home to wait, and then told weeks later that the case had been settled.
 
Settlement Conferences
 To reduce the number of civil juries picked and then sent into limbo, the report recommended that mandatory settlement conferences be held just before jury selection, and that plaintiffs and defendants each pay a jury-use fee of $500. The report also proposed that judges supervise lawyers during voir dire, both to speed up proceedings and to reduce what many jurors described as abusive questioning.
But Craig A. Landy of the New York County Lawyers Association said he had an "allergy to fees that cut off access to the courthouse." And Richard Godosky, a prominent plaintiffs' lawyer, said: "After the jury is selected, most cases are settled. If the selection of the jury is the end of the case, select as many juries as you can!"

HEADLINE: New Speaker Recasting an Image;
Successor to Weprin Is Reasserting Assembly's Influence

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 6

 BODY:
In the two months since Sheldon Silver became Speaker of the New York State Assembly, the former yeshiva boy from the Lower East Side has cast aside his unassuming ways and waged a calculated campaign to reassert his house's influence on a broad range of issues.
After the two-year tenure of Saul Weprin, who was perceived by many Democratic colleagues as too cozy with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Silver has set out to establish the Assembly as an independent force on criminal-justice policy, the state budget, welfare reform and Staten Island secession. 
 His tactics have often been confrontational, particularly in picking fights with Mr. Cuomo. But his manner has been so unthreatening, with his monotone voice as soft and mesmerizing as morning prayers, that he has managed thus far to walk the thin line between dissent and discord.
 
Confronting the Governor
 Some lawmakers thought that Mr. Silver's anti-charismatic style and the awkwardness of his ascension after Mr. Weprin's death last February would lead him to proceed slowly.
But almost immediately after taking office, Mr. Silver announced his opposition to the Governor's plan to imprison third-time violent felons for life without parole, a proposal that was to be a centerpiece of Mr. Cuomo's re-election campaign. Then he came out against expanding the state's pilot program of electronic fingerprinting for welfare recipients, a priority of both the Governor and the Republican-controlled State Senate.
Four weeks ago, he singlehandedly arrested the building momentum behind the Staten Island secession movement by declaring that the Assembly would take up the issue only if New York City's Mayor and City Council approved it first. And last week Mr. Silver scored what Assembly Democrats hailed as a major victory by negotiating a budget compromise that would significantly increase drug-treatment and vocational-education programs in the state's prison system. The agreement also would provide new money for programs that allow drug defendants to avoid criminal charges by entering treatment, a favorite Silver initiative that is viewed skeptically by the Senate Republicans.
"I think we basically showed the Governor and the Senate that this house has leadership," said Mr. Silver, "that this house is not getting dragged along in any process, that this house is going to have its say in any three-way negotiation."
Some Republican leaders say Mr. Silver risks losing allies by overplaying his hand in the name of assertiveness. And lawmakers in both major parties agree that politically it may not be the best time for Mr. Silver to distance the Assembly from the Democratic Governor's office.
 
Liberal Prescriptions
 Mr. Cuomo may face a difficult re-election campaign this fall and needs the support of his partisans in the Assembly. Furthermore, some of the more liberal prescriptions proposed by Mr. Silver and his colleagues on taxes and crime seem to run counter to public sentiment.
But Mr. Silver, the first Speaker from Manhattan since Al Smith, clearly knows how to play to his constituents, the 99 other Democrats in the 150-member Assembly, most of whom are from New York City.
Although he has been criticized in his district for fighting the integration of Lower East Side cooperative buildings, he won accolades from minority members by appointing Herman D. Farrell Jr. as the first black chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Although he is often typecast as a Manhattan liberal, he endeared himself to moderate members by allowing a vote supporting a constitutional ban on flag-burning, a measure he personally opposed.
Most of all, Mr. Silver's Democratic colleagues have reacted enthusiastically to his forcefulness.
"We needed it," said Assemblyman Albert Vann, a Brooklyn Democrat. "We have to stand for something. There have to be bottom lines and he represents our bottom lines very well."
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, a Bronx Democrat, said, "He's managed to convey in both specific and subtle ways the independence of this house."
 
Deeply Held Beliefs
 Although Mr. Silver seems eager to differentiate himself from Mr. Weprin, who grew up in Queens politics with Mr. Cuomo, the new Speaker said he has not orchestrated disputes with the Governor merely for political effect. Rather, he said, his stands are the product of deeply held beliefs, particularly on criminal-justice policy.
He has long called for controlling the growth in the state's corrections budget, which has tripled in the last 12 years, by diverting nonviolent offenders into drug treatment and other alternatives to incarceration. Meanwhile, he supports harsher penalties for violent felons, including the death penalty.
"What I want to accomplish," Mr. Silver said, "is to stop the charts from going off the wall in terms of how much we spend on the corrections budget so that we can use some of that money for productive things, including education and economic development that will create jobs. It may come to mind that I'm a criminal-justice liberal. I tend to think of myself as a fiscal conservative. It's a question of practical dollars."
He said he opposed the three-strikes-you're-out concept because it would cheapen the penalty of life without parole by applying it to a broad spectrum of felonies. He also said it would create a class of inmates with nothing to lose who might endanger guards and other inmates. And he said the state would have to maintain expensive geriatric wards in prisons for elderly inmates who no longer pose a threat to society.
Mr. Silver said he was troubled by welfare fingerprinting because of its suggestion of criminality. He also said a state study of a pilot program in two counties, which suggested that fingerprinting could save significant sums, had been shoddy and inconclusive.
 
Public Praise From Cuomo
 Mr. Cuomo reportedly has been annoyed by several of Mr. Silver's pronouncements, especially his opposition to the three-strikes-you're-out plan. But in public he has offered high praise for the Speaker.
"Every Speaker we've had has been required to stand up to the Governor," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. "That is to guarantee the dignity of the Assembly. Shelly has great natural ability. He's extremely bright. He has what is universally regarded as a pleasant personality."
That personality, as unflappable and gray as the suits Mr. Silver prefers, has served the 50-year-old lawmaker well during the 18 years he has represented the Lower East Side in Albany.
"No matter how tough it gets, you're not going to find Shelly running around in a tizzy," said Harold Jacob, a Lower East Side real-estate manager who has known Mr. Silver for 25 years. "I've never seen him lose his temper. But I'll tell you this about Shelly. Don't step on his toe. He will remember that you attempted to hurt him or his community. He's not a patsy for anybody."
Within his polyglot district, which is divided among Asian, Jewish and Hispanic residents, Mr. Silver has faced tough criticism for not backing plans for low-income housing in the Seward Park development. He is also accused of not supporting efforts to integrate the heavily Jewish cooperative buildings along Grand Street. Over the years, those buildings have served as both a home and a political base for Mr. Silver, an observant Orthodox Jew who searches diligently for kosher meals in Albany.
"Shelly is a charming, hard-working, bright, honest legislator," said Frances Goldin, vice chairwoman of the Lower East Side Joint Planning Council, a coalition of 35 groups that supports low-income housing. "He has one blind spot and that is the integration of his community." By not pressuring his Jewish constituents to accept integration, she said, Mr. Silver "is encouraging racism."
When confronted, Mr. Silver gives as good as he gets. Ms. Goldin, he said, "is a person who gets paid to make sure there's controversy" and who "obviously wants to deny her birth" as a Jew. He said he receives significant political support from all ethnic groups on the Lower East Side and has not supported low-income housing at Seward Park because the community is deeply divided over how to develop the property.
 
Sending Messages
 As Speaker, Mr. Silver has shown that he knows how to send messages to those who offend him.
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani scheduled a City Hall meeting with the city's Democratic Assembly delegation without first checking to see whether Mr. Silver could attend, the Speaker pointedly stayed in his office two blocks away. He was already peeved that Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, seemed to place too much faith in the Senate Republicans and did not fully appreciate the Assembly's role as the city's chief advocate in Albany. The breach of protocol seemed to symbolize that, Mr. Silver's aides said.
"I don't stand on ceremony," said Mr. Silver. "But if he had wanted me to be at the meeting, he should have checked with me before he scheduled it."
Mr. Silver can be equally assertive with his own members. Two weeks ago, Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio, a Queens Democrat, used the word "fag" in a floor debate on a gay-rights bill. Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a Manhattan Democrat, who is open about being a lesbian, complained to Mr. Silver, who studied a transcript and then chastised Mr. Seminerio in a private meeting.
"I indicated to Tony that I was disappointed and that I thought it was not appropriate conduct," Mr. Silver said. "I indicated that he should do something about rectifying the situation." Mr. Seminerio apologized publicly to Ms. Glick at the next caucus of the Assembly Democrats.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 4.32 as Most Indexes Barely Move

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After the largest one-day gain in more than two years on Tuesday, the stock market closed essentially unchanged yesterday, almost a mirror image of the bond market, which despite some large swings, also closed little changed from the previous session.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose by 4.32 points, to 3,679.73, but the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined by 0.24 point, to 448.05. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.23 point, to 750.72. 
 "The Dow's up two days in a row! How can we stand it?" laughed Don Hays, director of investment strategy for Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond. "But seriously," he added, "we're not out of the woods yet. You're going to see two or three days of rally, then you'll have a testing time" of possible market declines.
 
Familiar Worries
 Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading for Oppenheimer & Company in New York, said the stock and bond markets remained worried about future inflation and the prospects of an imminent increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board.
A market decline, possibly sharp, is still likely, Mr. Gallagher said. On Tuesday, the Labor Department is to report the Producer Price Index for March, and on Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index -- two statistics that are capable of moving markets. "People will start to get scared about them on Friday," Mr. Gallagher said.
The stock market generally tracked the bond market yesterday, but without the minute-to-minute parallel movements of previous sessions. From the beginning, bond prices fell slightly, as many traders apparently waited for higher yields to coax them into buying. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to as much as 7.327 percent, before settling at 7.24 percent.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.25, to 248.66, on volume of 302 million shares, about the volume of a typical day. Advancing stocks outnumbered those declining by 1,268 to 956. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.01 point, to 440.98.
 
The Dow's Big Gainers
 Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 13 showed price increases. They were led by Caterpillar, which rose 3 3/4, to 120; J. P. Morgan, which rose 1 3/4, to 62 1/4, and General Motors, which rose 1 1/2, to 58 3/4. There was no discernible news for Caterpillar or J. P. Morgan. General Motors, along with Ford and Chrysler, reported stronger vehicle sales in March.
Of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. index, 229 dropped in price yesterday, led by General Electric, which fell 1 1/4, to 97 5/8, and Wal-Mart, which declined 3/8, to 25 7/8.
Just before the market closed, G.E. disclosed that it expected its first-quarter earnings to be at the high end of analysts' estimates of $1.45 to $1.50 a share. Wal-Mart fell on no discernible news.
Over all, a wide variety of S.& P. industry groups saw their share prices fall yesterday. Health care companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb; electric utilities like SCE, the parent of Southern California Edison; long-distance telephone companies like A.T.& T. and electrical equipment companies like Westinghouse all saw their share prices fall.
 
A Hard-Hit Sector
 The biggest news event for the stock market occurred in Missouri, where voters on Tuesday narrowly defeated a state constitutional amendment that would have allowed slot machines and other games of chance in the state, where several riverboat casinos had been planned.
President Riverboat Casinos, the company in St. Louis known for developing floating casinos on the Mississippi River, was the most actively traded stock yesterday, at 12.6 million shares. It had planned a casino for Missouri. President Riverboat lost about a third of its value, dropping 5 3/8, to 12 1/2, on Nasdaq.
Other gambling stocks declined sharply, including Station Casinos; Hilton Hotels; Promus, the owner of the Harrah's casinos, and Argosy Gaming.
The American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico were the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, at 6.6 million shares. A single A.D.R., which represents 20 ordinary shares of the company, rose 1 1/8, to 58 7/8, on no discernible news.
But because the company is the largest stock on the Mexican exchange, it is often bought and sold as a proxy for the exchange and for Mexico. Shares of the company rose despite investors' concern that Mexican interest rates would rise soon.

HEADLINE: G.E. Says Earnings Are Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 6

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said today that its first-quarter earnings rose as much as 11 percent a share from last year, bolstered by excellent profit in its finance and brokerage businesses.
G.E., one of the world's 10 largest industrial companies, also said it expected record earnings in 1994. 
 The company said quarterly earnings "will be at the high end" of the range of $1.45 to $1.50 a share estimated by analysts. A year ago, G.E. earned $1.16 billion, or $1.36 a share, before an accounting change.
G.E. stock, which traded as high as $99.25 today, closed down $1.25, to $97.625, the lowest closing price since Nov. 18. More than 2.3 million shares were traded, twice the daily average during the last three months.
The company made its statement in response to questions about the performance of its brokerage firm subsidiary -- Kidder, Peabody & Company. The 129-year-old brokerage firm dominates Wall Street's mortgage-backed bond business.
As interest rates have surged in the last month, the prices of mortgage securities have tumbled as demand dried up. In addition, traders at Kidder, said the G.E. unit had lost money in connection with Askin Capital Management, a manager of highly leveraged investment funds, that failed last week. An official of Kidder said a preliminary estimate of the firm's losses ranged from $20 million to $30 million.
While G.E. declined to say how much Kidder made in the quarter, a Kidder executive said the period was among its best on record. Kidder, Peabody earned a record $439 million from operations last year, an increase of 46 percent from 1992.

HEADLINE: Clinton Finds a Lesson in Congressman's Life

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL 

DATELINE: BOWLING GREEN, Ky., April 6

 BODY:
In eulogizing a member of Congress who never became a creature of Washington and until last month never missed a vote, President Clinton suggested today that Representative William H. Natcher, the Kentucky Democrat who died last week, may have struck the perfect balance.
Mr. Natcher "taught us a lot about how to live in Washington," Mr. Clinton said after he left the funeral service. "I come from a place not unlike this Congressional district," he said. "And it's hard for people like me to adjust, I think, sometimes to the life in Washington. 
 "Bill Natcher understood that. He understood you had to try to live in Washington and operate in Washington like you would if you were back home."
During his 15 months in office, Mr. Clinton has seen some of his old Arkansas friends become some of his Administration's most high-profile casualties. And he has frequently complained of the confinement of the White House and the loss of privacy since becoming President.
 
Praised for Simplicity
 Mr. Natcher, who became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee shortly after Mr. Clinton was elected President, cast 18,401 consecutive votes in 40 years in office, the last four from a stretcher wheeled into the House chamber on March 2.
But those who eulogized him today spoke more often of his simplicity and Kentucky roots than of his record voting streak. Starting with his first election as county prosecutor, Mr. Natcher had held public office since the age of 27.
"Most of us in the second district would rather vote for a dead Bill Natcher than for a living someone else," said his pastor, the Rev. Richard W. Bridges, of the First Baptist Church.
Mr. Clinton said he had been reassured by Mr. Natcher during the fight to win the passage of his economic plan that he would eventually win. He also said he came to be charmed by Mr. Natcher's anachronistic ways.
"He found a way to live in Washington and work in politics and still found a way to be exactly the way he would have been if he'd been living here in Bowling Green running a hardware store," Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: Insurers' Double-Edged Sword

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
As some of the nation's largest investors in bonds, insurance companies have seen the value of their $1.4 trillion in bond investments fall by tens of billions of dollars since yields began rising in October.
Insurers' stock prices have dropped in lock step: shares of life insurance companies are down more than 20 percent since October and shares of property insurers are down about 12 percent. The declines are far steeper than the 5 percent decline posted by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks in the same period. 
 But analysts and insurance company executives say higher rates are not all bad news, despite the accompanying fall in bond prices.
"A lot of companies have been oversold in the stock market because of the pervasive belief that insurance companies' earnings suffer from higher interest rates," said Jeffrey R. Schuman, an analyst at Conning & Company, a Hartford securities firm that specializes in insurance company stocks. He said that the higher rates should push up investment income as insurance companies buy new, higher-yielding bonds.
 
 
Silver Lining in Higher Rates
 The silver lining from higher interest rates is most noticeable for life insurance companies, which say that they will be able to offer higher dividends to policyholders and higher interest rates to annuity holders. Annuities are contracts sold by insurers that promise payments to the policyholder either for a specified period of time or for their lifetime after a certain date.
Walter T. Kirkbride, president of Conseco Capital Management of Carmel, Ind., said that higher rates on annuities would help sales, after several years of reducing interest rates to annuity holders. Annuities, he said, are looking more attractive compared with some of the investment alternatives, with the stock market weak and rates on bank certificates of deposit remaining low.
Annuity sales have grown faster than ordinary life insurance in recent years. And premiums from the 20 million policies in force last year produced more income for insurance companies than ordinary life insurance.
While losses in the bond market in recent weeks have been substantial, most insurers say that their bond holdings are still worth more than their purchase prices. At the Equitable Life Assurance Society, for example, Brian S. O'Neil, chief investment officer, said the company's more than $20 billion of bonds were still in the black because Equitable, like other insurance companies, holds large amounts of bonds bought when interest rates were much higher.
Lee Roberts, treasurer at the Keyport Life Insurance Company of Boston, noted that the $10 billion of bonds held by his company were still worth $200 million to $300 million more than what the company paid. Several months ago, before bond prices began falling, Keyport's bonds were worth $500 million to $600 million more than what the company had paid.
 
 
Learned the Hard Way in '80's
 Although insurance companies could be hurt by further declines in bond prices, investors do not expect the bond market to return quickly to the dark days of the early 1980's, when double-digit interest rates were common. Then, losses in insurers' bond portfolios were so large that some companies would have been insolvent if accounting rules had required them to show their bonds at market prices rather than at the prices at which the bonds had been purchased.
For property insurance companies, higher interest rates do not confer any benefit to the insurance policies they sell. But Charles B. Gates, an analyst at CS First Boston, noted that there were "some companies in the fortuitous position of having positive cash flow, and for those companies, higher interest rates lead to increased earnings."
For both life and property insurance companies, the benefit of higher interest rates comes from the continuous inflow of new funds -- from policy premiums and from the interest and principal repayments they receive on their existing bond portfolios -- which allow the companies to make new investments at higher interest rates.
 
 
Sticking With Investments
 Unlike mutual funds or speculative investment partnerships, which often sell large blocks of bonds when their prices fall, aggravating market downturns, insurance companies tend to stick with their investments.
While the old investment strategy of "buy and hold," is beginning to change, it is still practiced by some industry giants like State Farm Mutual. The commitment of insurance companies to stay with bond investments even when the market is declining promotes stability and provides a kind of safety net for the financial markets.
But life insurance companies take a chance offering higher interest rates on new annuities because it could lead holders of old annuities with lower interest rates to cash in. Companies could face a problem if enough customers cashed in their annuities, forcing the companies to raise cash by selling the old bonds backing those annuities. Since those old annuities were backed by older, low interest bonds, selling those bonds would result in losses.
 
 
Cashing In Annuities
 One alternative -- raising interest rates on old annuities -- might keep policyholders from cashing them in, but it would reduce insurance companies' profit margins.
Insurance executives, however, say they are not likely to be hurt by the cashing in of old annuities. Earlier interest-rate fluctuations, they say, have taught them how to estimate customer activity and to organize their investments so that there is ample cash on hand and a profitable spread between the rates they pay customers and the rate they earn on investments.
Many companies are also setting the new annual rate for those annuities that may be cashed in without penalty much lower than the renewal rate they offer for annuities that have such penalties.
But in the eyes of the stock market, the benefits of higher interest rates are too remote and are overshadowed by the habit of assuming that higher interest rates must be bad for insurance company stocks.
 
 
Street's Conventional Wisdom
 "The stock market still follows the classic old arguments that insurance companies are hurt by higher interest rates," said Max Bublitz, senior vice president at Conseco Capital Management. Insurance companies are in disfavor, he said, even if they have shown in past years an ability to modify their annuities and insurance dividends when interest rates change.
For property insurance companies, however, which cannot change their policies as interest rates fluctuate, "the timing of the bond market decline couldn't have been worse," said Christopher Snyder, a specialist in property insurance companies at A. M. Best & Company, an insurance rating firm.
He explained that under new accounting rules, insurance companies must show the market value of bonds they hold for sale, with increases or declines in market values added or subtracted from the company's capital, though not from earnings. Gains or losses on bonds actually sold are included in the profits or losses.
Even though property insurance companies have $115 billion of capital to absorb unexpected losses, Mr. Snyder said, the effect of the accounting changes is still noticeable to investors. Declining bond prices are now seen as another element of volatility facing property insurers in addition to losses from catastrophes and payments for environmental cleanups.
"You now have more of what Wall Street and the stock market hate most: volatility and uncertainty," he said.

HEADLINE: Report Proposes Combining County Services and Localities

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, April 6

 BODY:
A report released today proposes merging local governments and services throughout Westchester County to eliminate overlapping jurisdictions and contain government spending.
"We have too much government and too little resources to pay for it," the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, said at a news conference where the report was released. 
 The report, titled Westchester 2000, was eight years in the making. It was compiled by a nonpartisan partnership of government officials and business leaders who solicited the ideas of hundreds of people, including academics and taxpayers.
But in a county where the loyalties to local governments and small communities run deep, the recommendations are unlikely to be enacted soon, if ever. Many residents have moved to the suburbs to, among other things, escape the sluggish bureaucracy of large cities.
 
Expecting Strong Reactions
 Further, such recommendations are hardly new in the metropolitan region, where blue-ribbon panels have issued reports calling for similar streamlining and reform. But those calls have largely been ignored.
"Merging governments gets you up against some very strong political feelings about communities," said Richard P. Nathan, the director of the State University of New York's Rockefeller Institute of Government. But he saw such efforts at consolidation as critical.
"I think the real reinvention of government is on the local level," he said. "That's where you have the most complex problems of duplication, parochialism, layering and fragmentation of government."
Mr. O'Rourke acknowledged that the report would inspire strong reactions, noting that he himself did not support all of its recommendations. "Every one of these is not going to happen," he said. "Some are going to fall politically."
He added, "It's not going to be easy."
 
Creating New Localities
 Still, the proposals are very likely to provoke debate at a time when villages, towns and cities throughout the county are struggling to reduce the cost of running government while continuing to provide adequate levels of services.
"It has to be talked about, and it has to be done somewhere along the line," Mr. O'Rourke said, adding: "It used to be that no one would talk about this."
Among other proposals, the report calls for creating 17 localities from the 39 villages and towns that now exist. For instance, Greenburgh, Tarrytown, Irvington, Dobbs Ferry, Ardsley, Elmsford and Hastings-on-Hudson would form a single government under the proposal.
The report also recommends consolidating police departments within the villages and towns, proposing a total of 17 departments. (Those departments operating within the county's six cities would not be affected.)
 
Reducing School Districts
 Also, while the report would leave the number of cities at six, it proposes the expansion of Peekskill and New Rochelle. The latter, for instance, would absorb two of its neighbors: the town of Pelham and the village of Pelham Manor.
The other recommendations included reducing the county's 40 public school districts by more than half, instituting term limits for the county executive and Board of Legislators and establishing collective bargaining for all local municipal workers.
The report noted that the cost of government rose by more than 105 percent from 1980 to 1990, from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion, in Westchester, where there are more than 500 jurisdictions that often overlap and thus create "waste and complication."
"Each city, town and village has its own set of police, fire, and court districts and maintain separate facilities for each," the report concluded. "This kind of fragmentation creates vast inefficiencies, both in terms of monetary costs and in the availability and quality of service delivery."
The report said it was important to act on the proposals because a number of economic and demographic factors have eroded the finances of local governments, businesses and individuals in the county. Those, the report said, include a decline in the county's job base, its high cost of living and the cost of providing social services to the county's growing elderly population.
But in the village of Elmsford where voters rejected a proposal to merge with the Town of Greenburgh in the mid 1980's, Mayor Arthur DeAngelis said people were still not ready to give up the accessibility and other advantages that small governments offer.
"My door is always open," Mr. DeAngelis said. "You can't do that in a big city. The bigger the city, the bigger the problems."

HEADLINE: Dances So Beloved They Are Hated

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
The history of ballet and modern dance is studded with works that have attached themselves to the companies that performed them, like an extra arm or leg or sometimes a whole new persona. Alvin Ailey could not escape "Revelations." For a time, "Tommy" was Les Grands Ballets Canadiens' middle name.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Joffrey Ballet has arrived with "Billboards," a ballet set to music by Prince, which opens tonight at the New York State Theater and will be performed nine times during a season that ends on April 17. 
 "Billboards" has been credited with luring the common man into the elegant precincts of classical ballet. The hottest of tickets, this ballet is said to have saved the Joffrey from financial collapse. Now the company is discovering that it is easier to book a rock dance than the jewels of 20th-century world ballet for which its repertory is -- or was -- known.
 
With Other Hits
 The company has had other rock hits before, among them Robert Joffrey's "Astarte" and Twyla Tharp's "Deuce Coupe," but there has been nothing like "Billboards," which threatens to outstrip its chief rivals among dances whose popularity has just refused to call it quits.
One dance is "Tommy." For years, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens was known as the company that danced that ballet, a version of the rock opera choreographed by Fernand Nault in 1970. Its Carl Orff trilogy just couldn't compete with the Who.
Another is "Revelations." Not long into his career, Ailey learned to flinch at the "r" word. His "Revelations" had been a huge success at its first performance, in 1960. The normally sedate 92d Street Y rang so loud and long with applause and cheers that William Kolodney, the director of the Y's dance program, stepped before the curtain to reassure the audience, in what was a unique announcement there, that the dancers would return in a month.
Life was never the same for Ailey, and he would never create another dance as popular as "Revelations."
 
Basking in Ovations
 The dance had an astonishing ripple effect. Ves Harper, who designed the costumes for the version of "Revelations" performed today, was startled to discover that he had suddenly become famous in Copenhagen, where he lives and had worked for years, after Danish audiences saw "Revelations."
Basking in ovations around the world, the performers would in later years sometimes lose sight of the finer points of choreography and character in this piece set to black spirituals. How could he work with them on it, Ailey once asked an old-time member of the company, with the cheers ringing in their ears? Unwary interviewers who asked him about the dance were likely to meet with exuberant groans from the choreographer. "Not 'Rev' again!" Ailey would exclaim.
 
Money Talks, Loudly
 Ailey once told Masazumi Chaya, who was his rehearsal director, that he wanted no performances of "Revelations" in the next season. Mr. Chaya knew better than to argue. Instead, he added up box-office receipts for performances with "Revelations" on the program and without it, then brought the figures to Ailey, who quickly changed his mind.
Kurt Jooss had a similar problem, though on a smaller scale. It is the rare balletomane who has heard of Jooss's "Dithyrambus" or "Gaukelei." But anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with dance knows "The Green Table," an antiwar ballet with a Brechtian bite. Created in 1932, it became the signature work of Jooss and his company after they fled Nazi Germany.
Jooss knew that audiences expected him to include the piece on programs. He did, on most. And sadly, "The Green Table" is the only one of the Joffrey's loving re-creations of ballets by Jooss that has survived.
For many Americans, ballet was defined by the lovelorn birds of the second act of "Swan Lake," a fast-forwarded one-act version of "The Nutcracker" and hot sex and cold-blooded murder in an Asian harem, as depicted in Fokine's "Sheherezade." No small-town opera house or school auditorium was spared, it seemed in the 1940's, from that increasingly threadbare touring program of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.
 
Choreographed and Appropriated
 Would the New York City Ballet ever go back to Balanchine? The question arose in the aftermath of Balanchine's immensely successful "Dances at a Gathering." No one seemed to be able to get enough of the simple, sumptuous dancing-party Jerome Robbins choreographed to Chopin piano music 25 years ago. Then there was "The Moor's Pavane," a distillation of "Othello," choreographed by Jose Limon and appropriated for a time by ballet troupes like the Joffrey and Nureyev and Friends.
There were enough thudding falls to the ground for the stately "Pavane" to qualify as unruly modern dance. But in the end, it all looked strangely like ballet. Modern dance had at last been made safe for ballet audiences.
Will "Billboards" make ballet a household word throughout America?

GRAPHIC: Photos: Regardless of its repertory, a ballet company is often identified with one work. Clockwise, from top left, Rudolf Nureyev danced "The Moor's Pavane" in 1974 (Linda Vartoogian, 1974); Cheryl Madeux was in the Joffrey Ballet's "Billboards" last year (Jack Vartoogian, 1978); and the Alvin Ailey Company performed its classic "Revelations" in 1978.

HEADLINE: China Makes It Tough

 BODY:
Beijing's domestic political anxieties probably explain the latest charges against Wei Jingsheng, China's leading democracy campaigner, and the criminal investigation of his office assistant, Tong Yi.
Deng Xiaoping has always put political control ahead of China's international reputation, and Mr. Wei, who has been fearlessly outspoken since his release from a long prison term last fall, has had a special knack for getting under the paramount leader's skin. 
 In fact, Mr. Deng is widely reported to have boasted to party colleagues a few years back that the indifferent reaction of foreign governments to Mr. Wei's earlier incarceration proved that China could take a hard line on dissent without damaging its basic interests.
But this time Beijing may have miscalculated, badly. Mr. Wei is too symbolically important, and the May deadline set by the Clinton Administration for deciding the future of U.S.-China trade relations too near at hand, for Washington to look the other way again. Congress and American public opinion would rightly see such a show of indifference as legalistic hypocrisy.
Beijing has correctly concluded that the Clinton Administration -- including human rights champions in the State Department as well as trade and economic officials -- is looking for a plausible way to justify renewing China's favorable tariff status this year. With that goal in mind, Secretary of State Christopher has been scrambling to portray his recent bumpy visit to Beijing as a pragmatic success. But Beijing's latest high-profile crackdown -- which also includes a Draconian sentence imposed on a Hong Kong journalist this week -- threatens to make full renewal of China's trade privileges politically impossible.
That is surely not what Beijing wants. China, despite its public posture of indifference, knows that the economic development plans on which the Communist regime's survival depends would be devastated by U.S. trade sanctions. But without some timely help from Beijing, the Clinton Administration could be forced into imposing those sanctions, harming American economic interests as well as Chinese.
The freedom of Wei Jingsheng is not one of the explicit conditions Mr. Clinton set down last May as the basis for deciding whether to renew China's trade privileges before they run out this July. On the two absolute conditions, policing prison labor exports and allowing freer emigration, China is already within reach of compliance.
The other conditions deal with issues like treatment of Tiananmen Square prisoners, respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (which includes the right of all people to freedom of opinion and expression), honoring the distinctive traditions of Tibet and ending the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts. On these, nothing more is required than a judgment call by the Secretary of State that there has been overall, significant progress.
But that judgment call will be hard to make, and to sustain in Congress, if China continues its provocative campaign against all dissent.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Certainly Do Create Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Myth: Small Business as Job Engine" (Business Day, March 25) tries to make the case that large companies are at least as proficient as small ones at job creation. This is certainly a point that can be illuminated empirically. Curiously, however, you provide no data to do so, while ignoring ample evidence to the contrary. 
 The crux of your article is a recent study of manufacturing employment that, you state, "is regarded by many other researchers as the most careful analysis of job creation and destruction to date." Paraphrasing the study, you state: "Companies with 500 employees or more created slightly more than half of all the new jobs from 1973 to 1988."
The results presented from this study in chart form, however, demonstrate that no single size category of manufacturer created net new jobs from 1973 to 1988. This, of course, is consistent with data you do not report, which shows that manufacturing's share of total employment declined from 26 percent in 1973 to less than 16 percent last year. In the 1973-88 period, meanwhile, the American economy created some 30 million jobs overall.
You ignore a mountain of available data that show smaller companies have indeed been the engine of job creation. You create a straw man out of one lone researcher, David Birch, whose work, you say, is widely credited with creating the "image" of small business job creation. There are ample sources of information that support his thesis.
For example, the 1993 Statistical Abstract of the United States includes a chart based on Small Business Administration data. It shows that companies with fewer than 500 employees created more than 13 million of the 19.3 million new jobs between 1980 and 1990. Of these, 82 percent -- 10.75 million -- were in companies with fewer than 20 employees.
Backed by Clinton Administration sources, your article proceeds to postulate that small businesses are not worthy of special tax and regulatory treatment because they are not the mythical job creators of the public imagination. It's worth noting, however, that far from providing special relief, the tax legislation of recent years -- especially the 1993 budget -- placed an added burden on job creating small businesses relative to larger companies. They now face the prospect of expensive new health care mandates.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Certainly Do Create Jobs;
Both Contribute

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The fundamental issue confronting advanced economies -- communities, countries or trading blocs -- was obscured by the discussion of job growth in "Myth: Small Business as Job Engine" (Business Day, March 25). Most analyses find that when all economic sectors are considered, both large and small make net job contributions. (Although when the entire sector is declining, as in manufacturing, the issue is relative.) 
 But those who are uncomfortable with the overstatements of politicians have done us all a disservice by implying that policy alternatives should focus on large versus small. The implication that economic growth is a zero-sum game distracts attention from other, more critical issues.
Advanced economies involve a complicated interdependency between large and small companies. The central issue is to determine the appropriate mix of large and small such that the entire system is efficient, competitive and adaptive. Whether this should be left to (a) the "natural" processes of economic markets, which are socially constructed mechanisms, or (b) influenced by public policy, is an important topic for study and debate.
Then, the analysis portrayed in these large-is-good discussions reflects the available Federal data sets, developed over decades, and assumes a static economic structure. There is an emerging body of evidence to suggest that economic regions with greater turbulence -- birth and death of companies, creation and destruction of jobs -- have greater subsequent economic (job) growth.
The complementary roles of new (usually small) companies in innovation and established (usually large) companies in implementing it, thus leading to changes in economic structure, would also be a fruitful topic for attention. The central problem continues to be economic growth and change, not comparisons of large versus small.

HEADLINE: For the Air and the Economy, Try Ethanol

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Coming Soon: The Alternative Fuel of the Future," Mobil Corporation's March 24 advertorial on alternative fuels and reformulated gasoline, is a thinly disguised attempt to sidetrack the Environmental Protection Agency's program to clean up gasoline and the air we breathe by blending it with clean-burning additives such as ethanol. 
 Mobil's ad omits ethanol as a fuel of the future. The E.P.A. is convinced ethanol makes economic and environmental sense as an alternate fuel and as a component in reformulated gasoline. The reason for Mobil's omission? Ethanol, a renewable product made from corn, other grains and potentially all forms of biomass, would compete with nonrenewable methanol, which major oil companies
largely import from the Middle East.
The international methanol interests and proponents in the oil industry are fighting a ruling the Environmental Protection Agency is still expected to announce in June to require ethanol, which reduces carbon monoxide emissions, to be mixed with the gasoline sold in our smoggiest cities.
I represent and chair the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, made up of 19 governors who believe the Federal Government is on the right track with a clean air ethanol-based program, which offers a job-creation bonus. More than half the country's governors support this program. In Nebraska, for example, new ethanol plants will result in nearly 4,500 new jobs. Iowa benefits from 15,000 ethanol industry jobs. Construction of new ethanol plants could add up to 75,000 jobs nationally every two years, according to our coalition's estimates.
In contrast, the petroleum industry has recently thinned its ranks by 450,000 employees. In 1992, four huge United States oil companies, including Mobil, pumped $6.5 billion into countries they used to call unstable to develop oil (and foreign jobs) while investing only $3.3 billion here at home. It should be no surprise that foreign imports and our trade deficit are spiraling skyward.
Public policy will be well served by working with United States refiners and encouraging the use of ethanol, a future fuel that reduces oil imports, cleans our air, stimulates economic development and creates American jobs.

HEADLINE: Resignation News Jolts Japan Stocks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, April 8

 BODY:
The shocking announcement today that Japan's embattled Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, intends to resign put stock prices into a temporary tailspin.
But analysts said the news created a sense of uncertainty rather than panic, and the world's second-largest market later rebounded to close slightly higher for the day. 
 Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange had been hovering earlier in the day, having changed little, when the news about Mr. Hosokawa hit the wires early this afternoon. Immediately, the Nikkei index of 225 issues plummeted about 300 points from its midday level, hitting a low of about 19,520.
But analysts said that, despite the obvious uncertainty the resignation announcement has created, there were some potential positives, at least in the short term. Those prospects caused prices to rebound, although most investors retreated to the sidelines.
At the close, the Nikkei index stood at 19,934.99, up 44.01 points, or about two-tenths of 1 percent, for the day.
Mr. Hosokawa had been well received by the stock market because of his strong rhetoric backing deregulation of the economy, a strong stimulus to end the recession and an end to the political corruption that brought down a string of governments in recent years.
But he failed to deliver on his promises and his economic stimulus packages were generally regarded as modest at best. Then, in recent weeks, he was swallowed up by a money scandal, which is what eventually brought him down today.
For the market, the worst problem was that battling over the scandal, which involved a loan from a trucking company at the center of other scandals, held up passage of the Government's budget. The new fiscal year began April 1 without a budget in place.
Because the budget included big spending increases to try to infuse new life into the economy, investors worried that the delay could forestall an economic recovery. It is now expected that at least a makeshift budget will be passed, even if the process of choosing a new Prime Minister drags on.
"The market is very dependent right now on getting an economic recovery," said Geoffrey Barker, the chief economist here with Baring Securities. "So if this helps pass a budget, that is a plus for the market."
He added that the resignation could also remove another source of uncertainty, heavy American pressure for a trade agreement from Japan. The American Government is expected to moderate its demands, at least until a new Prime Mininster is in place, Mr. Barker said.
"Over the long term this could be a problem because it could remove the momentum for deregulation, which was positive for the market," said Tim Hayashida, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. "But the deadlock on the budget had people worried. This may clear that up."
Tokyo stocks generally held up well through the international financial turbulence of the past month. The jump in interest rates in the United States pushed rates up here slightly, and the plunge in American stock prices created jitters. But the market has clung to its optimism that the deep two-year-old recession will lift later this year.
"We'd fallen less than in New York here because people have taken a wait-and-see attitude on the economy," Mr. Barker said. "Even with today's news, we're still in that position."

HEADLINE: Fed Shares In Chief's Rate Power

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Without a vote or even a formal discussion, the Federal Reserve's top policy makers are taking over the process of raising and lowering rates, rather than allowing their chairman, Alan Greenspan, to act on his own between meetings, as he often has in the past.
Several Federal Reserve officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the new approach not as implying criticism of Mr. Greenspan, but as a sign of growing reluctance to delegate authority to any single person. In fact, both of the Fed's recent moves to raise rates, in February and March -- the first increases in five years -- were made by the policy makers as a group. They acted in the face of faster economic growth and growing concerns about inflation. 
 The new approach to decision-making has evolved through consensus, and while it has not been made formal, neither has Mr. Greenspan challenged the change. It comes partly in response to pressures from Congress for the Fed to be more open and accountable for its actions.
"We are under enormous pressure from some quarters to stand up and be counted," a senior Federal Reserve official said, referring to Congressional demands for more disclosure of Federal Reserve deliberations. "This change we are making may be a halfway house for taking on that accountability as a committee rather than individually, by making rate changes committee decisions."
The Federal Reserve has said that its job has become more difficult because the economy is behaving in ways that traditional statistics fail to measure adequately.
"If our national indicators were more reliable, there would not be as great a need for a collective decision, and we would be delegating more authority to the chairman," said Harvey Rosenblum, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. "But you don't have one economy in the United States today. The national data are not representative of what is going on in every region. This recovery has been more uneven than any other since World War II."
In the past, the policy makers, collectively known as the Federal Open Market Committee, adopted directives that gave the chairman guidance. Actual changes were almost always made by Mr. Greenspan in the six to eight weeks between each meeting. He either acted on his own or after consulting with his colleagues in a conference call, a practice that Wayne D. Angell, a Fed governor who resigned in February, described as less than satisfactory.
"It is difficult for the members to politely disagree in a conference call the way they can at the meetings," said Mr. Angell, whose views sometimes clashed with Mr. Greenspan's.
 
 
 
Directives Cloaked in Jargon
 The directives adopted at each meeting are called, in Fed jargon, "symmetric" or "asymmetric." An asymmetric directive toward higher rates, or toward lower rates, would give Mr. Greenspan the green light to move in the indicated direction -- if he wished to do so -- between meetings. A symmetric directive is essentially an instruction to leave interest rates alone. Before the Fed's two recent moves, rate changes during Mr. Greenspan's nearly seven years as chairman have typically occurred in this fashion between meetings.
But significantly, the policy makers voted at their Feb. 4 meeting to raise rates that day. And instead of adopting an asymmetric directive to reflect their view that rates should be going up, they took the unusual step of adopting a symmetric one -- in effect, telling Mr. Greenspan not to act between meetings. The March 22 meeting produced another vote to push up rates that day.
 
 
Speculation About a Rift
 While the minutes of that closed-door meeting will not be published until May 20, the Fed policy makers may have adopted another symmetric directive -- again urging Mr. Greenspan not to act before the committee reconvenes on May 17.
"I don't like the symmetry-asymmetry stuff," one policy maker, who insisted on anonymity, said. "To me, the world would be better off without that little piece of subtlety."
The new insistence on changing rates at meetings, and not between them, has inevitably raised speculation that some members of the Open Market Committee were losing faith in Mr. Greenspan. The policy-making group comprises Mr. Greenspan and the six other Fed governors based in Washington, as well as the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks.
 Despite denials by many policy makers of differences with Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Angell said the chairman had not always responded as all the policy makers thought he should. Last May, for example, the policy makers gave the chairman a green light to raise interest rates, Mr. Angell said, but the chairman did not act, perhaps costing the Fed some credibility.
"I would say that to provide leadership, the chairman has to constantly renew the confidence of the members of the policy-making committee," Mr. Angell said. "And if anything tends to diminish that confidence, then the committee itself concludes that it should be making more decisions."
The committee has made other changes, too, in response to Congressional demands for more openness. When policy makers raised rates on Feb. 4 and again on March 22, both increases were publicly announced. That was a significant departure from the past practice of saying nothing at all, leaving Wall Street experts scrambling to figure out what happened.
The new approach to setting rates may, in fact, suit Mr. Greenspan, some Fed watchers on Wall Street say. They speculate that the chairman may welcome having the committee take responsibility for raising interest rates, a measure never popular among millions of Americans who end up paying more for such things as mortgages and car loans.
 
 
'A Powerful Chairman'
 But some Fed watchers, including Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at the Carnegie-Mellon Institute, argue that Mr. Greenspan is likely to retain substantial power in manipulating the decisions of the policy-making committee. "A powerful chairman can always get a committee to do what he wants, and Greenspan is a powerful chairman," Mr. Meltzer said.
The press office at the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington, asked for comment from Mr. Greenspan, did not provide any.
The new procedure seems to be pushed the hardest by some of the regional bank presidents, undoubtedly concerned about their own future. Under one recent Congressional proposal, they could lose their power to vote on interest rate changes because they are essentially representatives of specific regions, neither nominated by the Administration nor approved by Congress.
Whatever the motivation, the new practice is more in line with central bank procedures abroad. For example, Germany's central bank acts on interest rates when its members meet every other week. Under the Fed's new procedure, if no rate change comes forth, the public and the credit markets can assume that no change will be made until the next meeting, six or eight weeks in the future, unless an emergency arises.
In the past, stock and bond prices have often fluctuated in the weeks between meetings in response to speculation on Wall Street -- often unfounded -- that Mr. Greenspan was about to take some action.
 
 
No Barriers to Action
 Speaking mostly off the record, several policy makers noted in interviews that there are no formal prohibitions that bar Mr. Greenspan from acting between meetings. They dismissed as unfounded speculation that they were seeking greater control of policy out of concern that Mr. Greenspan had grown too close to the Clinton Administration and might be reluctant to push up interest rates.
They also dismissed speculation that the regional bank presidents were insisting on the change because they wanted to push rates up faster than Mr. Greenspan and the four other governors now in office. (Two seats are currently vacant.)
There have been frictions in the past between Mr. Greenspan and some colleagues. The tensions arose in spring 1991, when the economy was still weak from recession and the Fed was pushing rates down to encourage more borrowing and spending. More than once in that period, Mr. Greenspan lowered rates on his own, without consulting the regional bank presidents.
Under pressure, Mr. Greenspan began to make greater use of telephone conference calls. For 14 months, from December 1992 until Feb. 4 of this year, the Fed made no rate changes at all, because the economy remained weak. And now that changes have resumed, Mr. Greenspan's colleagues have moved to confine the Fed's actions to the meetings themselves.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Upbeat Greenspan View
 SAN FRANCISCO, April 7 (AP) -- A widening income gap has Americans fearful of the future despite generally good economic news, Mr. Greenspan said today.
The Federal Reserve chairman avoided any discussion of interest rates or the stock and bond markets' recent turmoil in a speech to business leaders here. Many in the the financial markets had been looking for Mr. Greenspan to give some hints in the speech as to what action the Fed might take.
Instead, he gave a long-range and generally upbeat assessment of the American economy -- but said polling data showed that the public did not share his optimism. "There seemingly inexplicably remains an extraordinarily deep-rooted foreboding" about the future, Mr. Greenspan said. "Half those polled expect the next generation will face lower living standards."
The basis for the gloomy outlook, he said, appears to be the increasing income gap between rich and poor Americans. The gap has widened in the last 20 years after narrowing for several decades before that.

HEADLINE: Europeans to Build Supersonic Plane

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 7

 BODY:
With Europe and the United States increasingly jockeying for leadership in efforts to build a new generation of supersonic passenger aircraft, the leading French and British aerospace companies said today that they would link up with their German counterpart to step up development of a successor to the Concorde.
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale of France, which built the Concorde together and which have been studying the possibility of a new supersonic plane for the last four years, said they would now be joined in that effort by Deutsche Aerospace, their partner in the Airbus consortium. 
 Today's announcement was seen by some within the industry as an attempt to present a united front to the governments of Europe in the quest for more financial aid. The European companies have been lobbying for more government money for research into supersonic aircraft to compete with the American industry, which is heavily involved in research sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 
Growth on Long Routes
 "We are looking for government to be supportive," said Ian Woodward, a spokesman for British Aerospace.
With much of the growth in airline traffic coming from long-haul routes like those from the United States and Europe to Asia, the aerospace industry worldwide has been increasingly enthusiastic about a new plane that would slash flying times and offer greater range and seating capacity than the Concorde.
In their announcement today, the European companies said they believed airlines would purchase between 500 and 1,000 of the new planes if and when they became available, presumably sometime after the turn of the century. Because of cost and environmental concerns, British Aerospace and Aerospatiale sold only 14 Concordes, seven each to British Airways and Air France.
Every major aerospace company in the United States, Europe and Japan has been working on supersonic research, and the companies have been cooperating to a certain degree through a joint international study group established four years ago.
 
Competition Is Intense
 But beneath the veneer of international cooperation, there is intense competition. The Europeans, having built the Concorde, want to maintain their leadership in the field, with all the jobs and money that a big new project would bring.
In the United States, the Boeing Company, which designed a supersonic plane in the late 1960's only to abandon it in the face of protests about noise, and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation both have active programs going, as do the major engine manufacturers, the General Electric Company and the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies.
Under American law, much of their work cannot be shared with foreign companies because it is partly financed by NASA. However, executives from both the United States and Europe said today that any plane that was built would have to involve partners from all over the world, if only because of the huge development cost; estimates start at $10 billion. Still, it is likely that one company or group will emerge as the prime contractor.
But such a plane faces daunting hurdles, including concerns about the noise from its sonic boom and its powerful engines, and its effect on the ozone layer.
 
Overcoming Concorde's Legacy
 Moreover, it will have to overcome the legacy of the Concorde, which was a financial disaster both for its builders and for the British and French Governments, which subsidized it.
"This airplane will not be built by Boeing unless it's economically viable and environmentally benign, and the barriers between the present situation and that eventuality are very significant," said Randy Harrison, a spokesman for Boeing in Seattle. But he added: "We do feel that progress is being made. Momentum is building."
The European partners said they had now decided on the general features of the plane, including a range of 6,200 miles, which is 2,500 miles more than the Concorde and sufficient to reach Asia from the United States or Europe. Passenger capacity would be 250, or 150 more than the Concorde, and it would offer three classes of service to Concorde's one. Like the Concorde's, its cruising speed would be about 1,500 miles an hour, or twice the speed of sound.
Perhaps most ambitiously, they said the new plane would have to operate cheaply enough that airlines could charge only slightly more than normal subsonic fares. The standard round-trip fare between London and New York on the Concorde is about $7,700, compared with about $6,000 for a normal first-class seat and under $500 for discounted economy fares.
"How much of the available market a supersonic aircraft will actually capture depends on how close it proves possible to come to the design objectives, and in particular the objective that fares for supersonic flights should not be significantly greater than normal subsonic fares," the companies said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Goldman Sachs Signs Major New Lease

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a reflection of financial vigor and an uptick in hiring on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs and Company, one of the nation's biggest brokerage concerns, has leased a large block of office space in lower Manhattan to expand its staff.
Although Goldman declined to disclose details, real-estate executives said it has rented 425,000 square feet, or roughly 25 percent of the space, in One New York Plaza, a 50-story office building just north of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. 
 Although the office market in lower Manhattan continues to stagnate, analysts said that the lease by Goldman Sachs underscores Wall Street's response to a pent-up demand for new employees and new office space.
"But because firms have delayed hiring, they are under strain," said Jeffrey Schaefer, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association, a trade organization that represents 700 firms that are members of the stock exchanges. "As long as there is no dramatic downturn in the markets, I see more growth."
People in the industry said Goldman has rented the space to accommodate new employees, not to relocate them.
Employment among the firms in Mr. Schaefer's group, now 244,000, has increased by 34,000 since the end of 1990, he said. That followed widespread layoffs in the aftermath of the dramatic stock market fall in October 1987, when the employment by the firms had reached a peak of 262,000.
Roughly half of those working for the securities firms in Mr. Schaefer's group are employed in New York City or its suburbs.
By signing a lease at One New York Plaza, Goldman Sachs has filled a building that was left nearly vacant in 1989 by its owner, the Chase Manhattan Bank. In that year, Chase moved all of its New York staff not assigned to its headquarters to two buildings it had constructed in Metrotech, a huge new complex in downtown Brooklyn.
The largest lease at One New York Plaza was signed in 1992 by Prudential Securities, which rented one million square feet of space in the building, which has a total of 2.3 million square feet of space.
Although the Wall Street area has a firm hold on the distinction of being the world's busiest and best-known financial district, it suffers from a surplus of old buildings that are difficult, if not impossible, to retrofit.
According to Edward S. Gordon, the real-estate firm, 23.6 percent of the office space in lower Manhattan is vacant, a record rate. In contrast, vacancies have been shrinking in midtown Manhattan, which has been attracting a wide spectrum of new tenants, including many from Wall Street.
The vacancy rate in midtown is 15.2 percent, down from a high of 18.5 percent in March 1992, according to Edward S. Gordon.

HEADLINE: Rise in Capital Outlay Is Projected at 8% for '94

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Businesses plan to increase spending on their factories and equipment by 8 percent this year, the largest gain in five years, as they scramble to meet stronger demand from consumers, the Commerce Department reported today.
The increase, to $633 billion, shows that "the economy is still on a strong footing," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Money Watch in New York. "We haven't had any effect from the higher interest rates." 
 As if to back up the report on capital spending, the Whirlpool Corporation announced plans to spend more than $100 million to build an appliance factory in Tulsa, Okla. Construction is to begin this summer.
The capital-investment figures follow previous Government estimates of a 5.4 percent gain in such spending this year, before adjustments for inflation. In 1993, spending on factories and equipment advanced 7.1 percent.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said today that the number of Americans entering unemployment lines for the first time increased last week -- the first gain since the beginning of March.
Initial jobless claims rose a larger-than-expected 6,000 last week, to 337,000, though analysts said the increase did not mean that the economy was weakening. Last Friday, the Government said the economy added 456,000 jobs in March, a figure that surprised the bond market, sending interest rates surging on fear of too-rapid growth.
 
Greenspan Perplexed
 Consumers, though, remain worried about the economy "despite what is obviously solid evidence of economic strength," said Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, in a speech in San Francisco today.
Perhaps reflecting this unsettled mood, consumer borrowing rose in February at about half the pace expected by analysts, according to new Fed figures. Installment credit rose by $3.54 billion in February, the ninth straight increase, after rising $6.38 billion in January.
The Commerce Department's report on capital spending showed that the industries with the largest planned increases included steel works and blast furnaces; stone, glass, and clay producers, and auto and truck makers.
The Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation in Virginia is planning to spend $10 million over the next two years to install a ladle furnace to meet demand. "We can hardly keep up," said Thomas Crawford, the company's assistant vice president and secretary. "We're producing a lot of steel, and it doesn't seem to be enough."
Coca-Cola intends to increase spending by 50 percent, or $400 million, this year, with 75 percent of the money going toward international expansion. Other American businesses are spending more on their international operations, too. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said foreign affiliates of United States companies planned to raise spending on factories and equipment by 8 percent this year, the biggest gain since 1990.

HEADLINE: In Maryland, Taking Free Papers in Protest May Soon Be a Crime

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
In cities and towns across the country, neighborhood and alternative city newspapers and campus dailies sit stacked in public places so that anyone can grab a free copy. But increasingly, those doing the grabbing are taking entire stacks because they disagree with the editorial content.
Yet even with witnesses and confiscated papers as evidence, publishers have been unable to convince the police and prosecutors that it is a crime to take something that is already free. 
 Maryland is the first state to consider legislation branding as censorship these acts of protest that others say are expressions of free speech. The State Senate recently passed the bill, 46 to 1; the House is expected to pass it on Friday with equal ease. Gov. William Donald Schaefer has said he will sign it into law.
The bill would make it a misdemeanor to take "one or more newspapers with the intent to destroy the newspapers or prevent other individuals from reading the newspapers." Those convicted could be fined up to $500 or imprisoned for up to 60 days.
That has drawn fire from opponents, including the editorial pages of The Washington Post and The Baltimore Sun, who contend that seizing free papers is in itself an expression of free speech.
 
Core Issue Is Intent
 "Taking extra stacks of papers does not add to the symbolism of protest; it seems intended only to keep others from reading them," said Rodney Smolla, a law professor at the College of William and Mary and author of "Free Speech in an Open Society," published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1992. "If the law is written to make this the core of the crime, then it's perfectly consistent with the First Amendment" provision protecting free speech.
At the Student Press Law Center in Washington, a nonprofit group representing student journalists, its executive director, Mark Goodman, said his group had received 20 reports of seizures for the 1992-93 school year, and 25 since colleges and universities opened last fall. "Two years ago," he said, "we had three or four in the entire school year."
Last fall, campus newspapers at the University of Maryland were snatched by minority students protesting what they said was its racist content. But it was the repeated seizure from public libraries of a Washington weekly for homosexuals that prompted State Senator Howard Denis, a Republican from the Maryland suburbs of Washington, to sponsor the legislation.
Those confiscating the paper have said they were anti-family and should not be on display in libraries. But even after members of the weekly's staff photographed a man loading the papers into a car, the state would not prosecute.
"But it is a crime, and this is a free speech bill," Mr. Denis said. "There are fundamental First Amendment issues at stake here. We're not book-burners or newspaper-burners."
 
Elements of Theft Law
 Matthew Campbell, the Maryland state's attorney who decided not to prosecute, said papers that are available free of charge do not have the same legal status as papers for which people pay.
"The requirements of theft law are such that you have to prove certain elements," Mr. Campbell said. "One is that the property is wrongfully taken from its rightful possessor. In this instance, the paper gave up its possession by placing the papers in libraries.
"Second, you have to prove value," he continued. "It's a free paper. The ordinary, objective economic value of something is its sales price. Here there is no sales price."

HEADLINE: Bronx Leaders Boycott Ceremony on Federal Aid

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Borough President Fernando Ferrer and other elected officials from the Bronx boycotted a ceremony announcing an agreement on a Federal inner-city development program yesterday, saying they were upset that the program would benefit only a small portion of the borough around Yankee Stadium.
The agreement, between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Representative Charles B. Rangel, designated all of Harlem and a slice of the South Bronx as the area the city hopes will be selected as one of six urban "empowerment zones." 
 Most officials expect that New York's application will be accepted, if for no other reason than that Mr. Rangel sponsored the legislation creating the program. The empowerment zone will bring $100 million in direct grants that can be used for job training, drug and alcohol treatment and emergency shelter, and create tax credits for companies that employ residents within the zone.
Mr. Ferrer, who in recent weeks has battled with Mr. Rangel over whether the money should go to Harlem or the Bronx, said that while he was pleased the program would benefit the borough, he was upset that the area included an industrial area and Yankee Stadium rather than areas where low-income people live.
"The empowerment zone is intended to help the poorest of the poor," said Mr. Ferrer, who attended the dedication of an athletic building at Lehman College rather than the news conference that Mr. Rangel and Mr. Giuliani held to announce the agreement. "But it includes Yankee Stadium, which is not as important. It is a disappointment and I hope there can still be some minor changes made so that other areas can be included."
Although the inclusion of part of the Bronx was part of a compromise intended to satisfy Mr. Ferrer and other Bronx officials, Mr. Rangel, who represents Harlem, was the clear winner.
But the compromise also benefits Mayor Giuliani. By including Yankee Stadium, he was able to appeal to George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, who has been pressing the city to improve conditions around the stadium and who has dropped broad hints that he might move the team elsewhere.
In general the plan is expected to aid the Yankees and other businesses near the stadium by giving them special tax-exempt bonds and tax credits in return for employing local residents.
"We haven't yet been made aware of the funds available," said David Sussman, general counsel for the team. "But we've studied the legislation and there are tax benefits to the Yankees."
The Mayor defended the inclusion of the stadium, saying: "It's one of those things that draws people to New York City. If you have an important asset, you should be considering the area around that asset so it doesn't decay and you lose it."
And he rejected criticism that he had tailored the compromise to appeal to Mr. Steinbrenner. "This will help the city fulfill an obligation that the city has to the people in the area surrounding Yankee Stadium," he said.
The boundaries of the empowerment zone have not yet been fully determined. But under the agreement between Mr. Rangel and Mr. Giuliani, the area covered will include Harlem and a section of Washington Heights as well as an industrial area of the Bronx that includes the Harlem River Rail Yards, the Port Morris section and Yankee Stadium.
Several Bronx officials, including Mr. Ferrer and Representative Jose E. Serrano, had lobbied for other areas of the Bronx, including Hunts Point, Mott Haven and Melrose. And while yesterday's announcement at the State Office Building on 125th Street was attended by four City Council members who represent Manhattan, the Bronx delegation was represented by just one member, Adam Clayton Powell 4th, most of whose district is in the East Harlem section of Manhattan.
 
Powell's Objections
 But Mr. Powell, too, said he had troubles with the final outcome. "The Yankees have the richest franchise in the country," Mr. Powell said. "There are poor people in the Bronx who are not going to see the benefit of this that they are entitled to."
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Rangel defended the boundaries covered in the agreement, saying the empowerment zone would help produce jobs in both Harlem and in the South Bronx. "I think we've achieved a good deal for the South Bronx," Mr. Giuliani said. "What we've achieved for the South Bronx is consistent with the rationale of this empowerment zone. If you were to disperse the benefits much more than we've done, then you would not be able to have the impact that we have had."
Mr. Rangel also defended the inclusion of Yankee Stadium. "The only reason I thought of the Yankees was jobs, to get more people working," he said.
"It just happens to be the Yankees that are the engine of development in the area. If the Yankees left and someone else wanted to use the credits, they could. When we say it's for Yankee Stadium, it's for an entire grid on the map, not just for the stadium."

HEADLINE: The New South Americans: Friends and Partners

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, April 7

 BODY:
On Rio's bay, two huge Brazilian cannons have been waiting for Argentine warships for decades, monuments to the long enmity between South America's two regional powers. But today the guns are frozen with rust, visited by tourists, many of them Argentines.
Ten years ago, Argentina and Brazil were run by military dictators, who inflated defense budgets and sharpened nationalist tensions. Now, with both countries under civilian rule, they have discovered that former enemies can make good trading partners. 
 The new friendship and economic interplay between the two neighbors are part of a quiet revolution taking hold across a continent long dominated by militarists and protectionists.
Military barriers are coming down, and new webs of free-trade pacts, of highways and waterways and of oil and gas pipelines are rapidly binding South America together as never before. Generals are taking a back seat to free traders.
 
An Invasion by Tourists
 "The countries of South America have become so interdependent that it lessens the possibility of an outbreak -- Brazil against Argentina, or Chile against Argentina," said Jerry Haar, a senior research associate at the North-South Center at the University of Miami.
Today, when Argentine tourists invade Brazilian beach resorts wielding Southern Cone bank machine cards, it is hard to remember that only a few years ago Brazilian engineers designed international road bridges so they would collapse under the weight of an Argentine tank.
In Argentina, as memories fade of 1977 blackout drills against threatened Chilean air raids, engineers push a railroad tunnel, a gas pipeline and an oil pipeline through the Andes. Inaugurated in February, the oil pipeline now supplies half of Chile's petroleum needs.
Reworking foreign policies traditionally oriented toward the United States and France, Latin leaders are discovering that their fastest growing trade is with their neighbors.
"Our trade with Paraguay is now greater than our trade with France," Celso Amorim, Brazil's Foreign Minister, said in an interview. "Our trade with Uruguay is now at the same level as our trade with Britain."
Brazil is negotiating the formation of a South American Free Trade Area, with 1995 to be the starting point. "Following the North American example, we want to abolish tariffs on 80 percent of South America's regional trade over 10 years," Mr. Amorim said:
 
Military Spending Drops
 Greeted favorably by many South American nations, the Brazilian proposal capitalizes on forecasts that most trade within the continent will be duty free by the end of the 1990's. Benefiting from Latin America's opening to outsiders, American business executives have already converted the region into the world's fastest growing market for United States exports.
And it is easy to see how detente is soothing national tensions.
With the advent of civilian rule in the three major countries of the Southern Cone -- Argentina, Brazil and Chile -- annual military spending has dropped by one-quarter, from $4.9 billion in 1985 to $3.7 billion in 1992, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Since 1990, trade between Argentina and Brazil has more than tripled, hitting $6.3 billion last year and making Brazil Argentina's largest trading partner.
What kind of Argentine ships would Rio's shore guns blow out of Rio's harbor today? Certainly not oil tankers, now that Argentina is Brazil's second-largest source of imported oil after Saudi Arabia. Certainly not freighters loaded with wheat, now that Argentina supplies 75 percent of Brazil's imported wheat.
Regional trade is expected to continue to leap again after Jan. 1, the day that four neighbors -- Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay -- introduce tariff-free trading under a common market known as Mercosul. (In Spanish-speaking countries, the agreement is known as Mercosur.)
"The whole hypothesis of war between Argentina and Brazil has been junked," said Thomas A. O'Keefe, president of Mercosur Consulting Group, a New York business consulting concern. "I don't think that anyone in the Argentine military or in the Brazilian military still sees the other as a potential threat."
In the last century, Brazil and Argentina built their railroads with different track gauges to prevent an enemy invasion by rail. Today, integration is the order of the day.
Brazilian engineers are drawing up plans for a 1,500-mile highway to speed products between Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires. This month, a Washington consulting firm, Louis Berger, started feasibility studies on one link, a $1 billion, 30-mile bridge, joining Buenos Aires and Colonia, Uruguay. In March, the Inter-American Development Bank agreed to finance almost half of a $718 million project to improve road and river links between Argentina and its neighbors.
 
United by Their Rivers
 By the end of this decade, Mercosul nations hope to complete the Hidrovia, a five-nation inland waterway that will allow barges to travel 2,140 miles down the Paraguay and Parana Rivers, from eastern Bolivia to the South Atlantic. By next October, Brazil plans to inaugurate a separate system of river locks that will allow barges to travel 1,500 miles from Paraguay to Sao Paulo.
Spilling over national borders, 200,000 Brazilian farmers now grow most of Paraguay's soy crop. An additional 10,000 Brazilian farmers have moved into eastern Bolivia. Brazilian investment is so heavy in the the thinly populated interior of Uruguay that newspapers predict that Brazilians will own one-quarter of that nation's farmland by the end of the decade.
Nowhere is the improvement in relations in South America clearer than on the Chilean-Argentine border.
In 1977, with generals ensconced in their presidential palaces, the two neighbors came to the brink of war over ownership of islands at South America's southern tip. Ten years of civilian rule in Argentina and five years of it in Chile have reworked the landscape. Since 1991, the year the countries settled 22 border disputes, trade has tripled, and Chilean investment in Argentina has jumped from about $100 million to $2 billion.
 
A Tunnel Through the Andes
 Construction started last year on a 750-mile pipeline to supply Santiago, Chile, with natural gas from Argentina. This year, engineers are to begin studies on the building of a 14-mile electric railroad tunnel through the Andes.
On a smaller level, the regional detente is seen in the relations between Paraguay and Bolivia, which had more than half a century of animosity after Paraguay won the Chaco War of 1932 to 1935.
"Stroessner was wounded in the war, and he kept the animosity going, preventing commerce with Bolivia," Timothy Towell, a former United States Ambassador to Paraguay, recalled of Alfredo Stroessner, a general who ruled Paraguay from 1955 to 1989.
But last May, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, a businessman, was inaugurated as Paraguay's democratically elected civilian President. In September he visited Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
"He met with ancient old war veterans on crutches and returned a bit of war booty, a rusty old Bolivian tank that had been sitting on a plaza in Asuncion," Mr. Towell recalled.
On a return visit to Asuncion last month, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, Bolivia's civilian President, signed agreements calling for the paving of the Trans-Chaco Highway and for the construction of a gas pipeline from Bolivia to Asuncion.
 
A Good Neighbor Policy
 Elsewhere, countries that were once locked in arms races now discover that former enemies can be their best markets.
While many Peruvians nurse grudges with Chile over the loss of territory in the 1879 War of the Pacific, Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori, has pursued a good neighbor policy, visiting Santiago five times in the last two years. Chile is now a major investor in Peru's privatization of state companies.
By reducing border tensions with Chile and Ecuador, Mr. Fujimori has been able to divert scarce military dollars away from tanks and jet bombers to counterinsurgency warfare against Shining Path guerrillas.
Colombia and Venezuela, neighbors who competed in arms races in the 1980's, have also discovered the benefits of free trade. After they adopted a tariff-free trade pact in 1991, trade between them tripled, hitting $1.6 billion in 1993.
Border incidents that used to inflame tensions are increasingly muffled. In January, a Venezuelan National Guard helicopter landed inside Colombia and detained several Colombian fishermen. On trying to take off, the overloaded helicopter crashed. Hoping to blame Colombian guerrillas for the crash, another Venezuelan unit machine-gunned the helicopter wreckage from the air.
When the fraud became known, a Venezuelan general granted an interview to Colombian television. He apologized.

Who's Merry Now? Sherwood Forest May Be Sold

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NOTTINGHAM, England

 BODY:
There isn't much left of Sherwood Forest, and what there is, Robin Hood would hardly recognize.
Farmland, pasture, coal mines and urban sprawl have claimed most of the trees. Where there is greenwood -- scattered pockets like islands adrift on the dull Midlands plain -- it consists mostly of dense stands of Mediterranean pine, imported and planted by the Government after World War I as a timber cash crop.
Bu 
 t while Sherwood Forest is only a thin wisp of its medieval past, when the thick gnarled oaks and spindly birches offered sanctuary to the bandits and rebellious woodsmen who once harried the Sheriff of Nottingham, its scattered remnants are at the heart of national debate over the future of Britain's public forest lands.
Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Government is contemplating whether to turn over to private investors control of 4,355 square miles of woodland and heath, nearly 5 percent of the nation's land area. The land is now managed by the Forestry Commission, Britain's largest landowner.
Proponents of free-market economics in the Tory Government argue that privatization of Britain's forests, like the earlier privatization of airlines and utilities, would draw fresh investment and help renew the moribund timber industry.
But a coalition of local government officials, conservationists and recreation enthusiasts has mounted a loud campaign, warning that selling these lands would sharply reduce public access to them.
"Now that the coal industry has collapsed, we view our forests as the heart of our county and the key to our future," said Gareth Broome, the forestry officer for Nottinghamshire. "We obviously don't want to see them fall into the hands of private owners more interested in profit than public access."
Few groups are as organized and vocal as Britain's vast army of hill walkers, hikers and bird-watchers, who have a passionate attachment to what is left of the countryside. Walking is ritually listed in surveys as Britons' favorite outdoor activity.
But unlike the national forests and parks of the United States, nearly all of Britain's undeveloped forest, coast and moorland is in the hands of private owners -- landed families, mostly, who have controlled it for centuries.
Government officials insist that no decision has been made on the fate of the forest lands, and have promised to do whatever is necessary to insure public access. But they also concede the land is less marketable if the Government insists on attaching covenants guaranteeing public access.
According to a study published in February by the Ramblers' Association, a hikers' group, nearly 85 percent of the 250,000 acres of Forestry Commission lands sold off to private owners since 1981 has since been closed to the public.
"Robin Hood and his colleagues would rise from the grave if they knew what this wicked Government was doing," said Paddy Tipping, a Labor member of Parliament from Nottingham. Robin Hood and his Merry Men are the legendary 12th-century heroes who lived in Sherwood Forest and robbed rich Normans to help poor Saxons.
Sherwood Forest's fate illustrates Britain's changing perspective toward its forest lands. As Britain became more densely settled, wide areas of Sherwood Forest disappeared to make way for farms and, later, the exploitation of the rich Nottinghamshire coal fields. Now most of the mines have closed, and with thousands of miners out of work local officials are focusing once more on the forest, seeing its scattered remnants as a way to lure tourists.
The Robin Hood legend already draws large numbers of visitors each year to a nature center and 450-acre tract managed by the Nottinghamshire government. The very heart of the old hunting forest, it is now a thinning woodscape of birch, yew and brooding oaks.
Nearly half of the forest that remains in the county is in the hands of the ducal estates. Of the remainder, all but a small part is managed for timber production, consistent with a national policy historically aimed at reducing dependence on imports.
But with domestically produced lumber currently accounting for barely 12 percent of national consumption, the policy has been shifting toward recreation and other uses, said Austin Brody, a Forestry Commission official here.
Mr. Brody leads a program called the Sherwood Initiative, working with local landowners to use vacant land to re-create as much of the original forest as possible, including replanting stands of oak cloned from the remaining ancient trees.
As chain saws echoed across part of the forest recently, with woodsmen harvested pines for a company that makes rustic fences, workmen elsewhere were building a playground and tending roads and bike trails carved through the woods for weekend visitors. Forest managers will organize spring horseback treks, archery contests and guided walks.
"It's not the wonderful old oak forest of Robin Hood's time," Mr. Brody said, standing among the tall Corsican pines, which give the Midlands landscape the look of a Mediterranean hillside. "But it is a forest, and after all, this is Sherwood. So the point is, let's be creative and make the best use we can of all of it."

HEADLINE: Trenton Panel Offers Plan On School Aid

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 7

 BODY:
A special commission named by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today recommended solving New Jersey's nettlesome school financing problems by making all but the very poorest districts pick up substantially more of the costs of running their schools.
The commission's plan would also limit special aid from the state to only that which is essential to bring the poorest districts into closer parity with the richest ones. And richer school districts could not increase their own spending by more than the rate of inflation each year -- a proposal that would put a stringent brake on wage increases for teachers. 
 In another move that is certain to provoke a storm of protest from the state's 589 school districts, the proposal would shift most of the financing of teacher retirement expenses from the state to the local taxpayers. Former Gov. Jim Florio tried a similar move in 1991, so provoking the teachers' union that the Republican legislative majority shifted the pension and Social Security costs, amounting to about $767 million a year, back to the state budget.
 
Cabinet to Evaluate Plan
 Governor Whitman described the report as recommendations, not policy, and said she would turn the report over to her cabinet for evaluation.
"I am neither endorsing this report nor distancing myself from it," she said. At the same time, Mrs. Whitman seemed prepared for the expected complaints from local school boards that the new state rules would force local taxes to rise.
"I object to the basic premise that says that whenever something happens at the state level it necessarily means higher taxes at the local level," she said.
The Governor created her 15-member Education Funding Task Force last December to sort out a school financing system that is under court order to spend more on poor districts, plagued by fierce competition for state aid, and dominated by a politically powerful teachers union that has, in the past, defeated all attempts to shift money from the rich to the poor. Another commission, appointed last year by Mr. Florio with a similar mandate, has been unable to agree on a solution; its leader, Albert Burstein, a former Assemblyman, said today that the Whitman group had come up with a plan similar to the one he favored.
Twelve states, including Connecticut, Texas and California have, like New Jersey, had their school financing policies ruled unconstitutional on the ground of unfairness to poor districts. New York's school aid plan was challenged and upheld in court in 1982, but an appeal by plaintiffs is expected.
Today, the New Jersey School Board's Association reserved judgment on the Whitman commission's plan until its officers had a chance to study it, but officials there made it plain that the recommendations were not welcome ones.
 
Report's Key Points
 "From listening to the presentation it's obvious that the report plans to go in the opposite direction in school funding that we want," said the group's spokesman, Frank Belluscio 3d. "On the pension costs, we are opposed to local districts absorbing what amounts to a state mandate. At a time when the state is talking about controlling mandated expenses, we find giving the districts a new one is no way to ask districts to control costs."
These are the commission's key recommendations:
*School districts would be required to spend a minimum of $6,750 per pupil in elementary schools, $7,425 in middle schools, and $8,438 in high schools. The state would continue to pay 37 of 41 percent of this amount, as it does now, and local school systems could spend more if they wished.
*Increases in school aid would be limited to the amount of increase in state per capita income, while increases in local spending would be capped at the rate of inflation.
*State aid to the state's 37 poorest districts, the ones at the heart of the case that went to the New Jersey Supreme Court, would be increased by 10 percent a district a year until each district had reached 80 percent of the average per pupil spending of the wealthiest districts, or about $8,000.
A former state education commissioner, Saul Cooperman, and Sam Thompson, an education consultant, who headed the 15-member commission, said the group believed the 80 percent rule would satisfy the court's ruling that poor districts must achieve "substantial parity" with rich districts for the state financing system to be deemed constitutional.
The Florio group that has failed in two public votes to agree on a plan has one significant difference from the Whitman panel: among its members is the president of the teachers union, while Mrs. Whitman's commission included no union partisans.
Under the group's proposal, the state would shift all Social Security costs and half of the pension costs to the school districts over four years. During the current school year, pension and annuity costs amount to $375 million, while Social Security costs run at $392 million annually.
Because pension costs are tied to wage levels, the members of the New Jersey Teacher's Association, the teachers union, would face much tougher resistance to wage increases if local districts were required to shoulder pension and Social Security expenses.
"We are opposed to any proposal to shift pension and Social Security costs to the local districts," said a spokeswoman for the union, Karen Joseph. "That is a state responsibility since 1955, and all that will do is raise local property taxes. It is unacceptable."
The Cooperman and Burstein school financing commissions have their roots in a 1990 state Supreme Court ruling, Abbott v. Burke, that held a state financing mechanism relying on local property wealth as its tax base violated the state constitution by depriving cash-poor districts equal financing with the rich ones.
Mr. Florio tried to bridge the gap by shifting some $380 million in state aid from rich to poor districts, to be paid for in part by local districts assuming their teachers' pension costs. Known as the Quality Education Act, the Florio plan was watered down by the legislature until no rich-to-poor shift took place.
An important question about today's recommendations is whether the state courts will accept the commission's view that bringing poor districts to within 80 percent of rich ones meets the state Supreme Court's definition of "substantial parity."
Governor Whitman, for one, was not prepared to say that the court would accept that view, or even that she would argue it.
"The arguments before the court are going to go forward on their own, and they are not going to be contingent on this recommendation," she said today. "This is a report, a recommendation to the administration, and it is yet to be studied and we have have yet to adopt parts of it, or all of it, or however we want to modify it, before we go before the legislature."
Besides Dr. Cooperman and Dr. Thompson, the commissions members were: Barbara Wright Bell, President of the Amelior Foundation; Richard DiPatri, vice president of Educate America, a consulting group; John Klagholz, a member of the state Board of Education; David Rand, a school board lawyer; Robert Swissler, a former assistant education commissioner for finance; George Gilmore, the commission's counsel; Marie Parnell, superintendent of the Sayreville public schools; Peter Contini, Gloucester County schools superintendent; David Warner, Red Bank schools superintendent; Carol Choye, Scotch Plains superintendent; Elsa Gomez, president of Kean College; Harold J. Raveche, president of the Stevens Institute of Technology, and Joanne Kenny, a teacher in Jersey City schools.

HEADLINE: Word of Plans for Additional Tax Cuts Puts Albany Lobbyists in a Frenzy

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 7

 BODY:
With a proposal to cut $400 million in taxes on the budget negotiating table, but no decision on which taxes to cut, the State Capitol was filled today with furious lobbying by companies large and small seeking reductions for their industries.
Lobbyists for soda and beer companies stalked the corridors, brief cases brimming with memorandums on how to cut beverage taxes. The New York State Home Builders Association rousted its 4,000 members to call lawmakers with a proposal to reduce real-estate-gains taxes. Securities companies in Manhattan launched fax machine assaults with proposals for a tax credit worth $30 million to their industry. Industrial giants like Eastman Kodak, I.B.M. and General Electric pressed for arcane tax code changes as valuable as they were oddly named: double-weighted sales, NOLs and the AMT. 
 "It's a feeding frenzy for people who pay business taxes," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who says he is pigeonholed six times daily by business lobbyists peddling pet cuts. "Name an industry, and they've been to see me. I've never seen it like this before."
What has churned the Capitol's waters into such froth is the slowly improving economy and an agreement by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders to cut taxes by at least $400 million in the coming fiscal year as part of a $33.4 billion budget that is now a week late.
 
Little Movement in Talks
 Despite their general agreement on how much to cut, Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders have each advanced competing tax-cut proposals, and for the last week there has been little movement in closed-door talks over what to select from the long and growing menus.
The relatively small amount of money for cuts has made the work of lobbyists more urgent as they hustle the hallways trying to push their cuts to the top of the list. But the confusion at the negotiating table has spelled opportunity for late comers.
"Normally this would be kind of late for lobbyists to jump in," said Assemblyman Joseph Crowley, a Queens Democrat who received three phone calls from business lobbyists on Wednesday. "But they smell something and want to get a piece of it."
While lobbyists pushed for new or deeper cuts, welfare advocates, labor unions and a growing number of lawmakers raised concerns that the $400 million tax-cut package, while perhaps affordable this fiscal year, could cost the state between $1 billion and $2 billion in future years as phased-in reductions took affect.
They warned of parallels between 1994 and 1987, when the Legislature approved deep cuts in personal income and business taxes during a flush period, only to postpone the cuts later because of the recession and a steep decline in tax revenues that caused severe budget deficits.
"In 1987 we were falling over each other to see who could top who in how fast and how deep we cut taxes," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat. "In our desire to one up the other party, we passed tax cuts than we could afford."
When he introduced his budget in January, Mr. Cuomo proposed a package of tax cuts that would cost $210 million in the fiscal year that began on April 1, with the cost growing to $710 million by 1998. Mr. Cuomo's plan includes reducing the corporate surcharge, phasing out the state hotel tax, creating a tax credit on operating losses and giving working poor families a credit on income taxes.
Mr. Cuomo said today that he could not project the long-term impact of a $400 million tax cut because there has been no agreement on which taxes to reduce. He said he would oppose any tax cuts that would jeopardize future budgets. But when asked how he would know what those cuts are, he invoked a former Supreme Court Justice: "It's like Potter Stewart's definition of obscenity. You know it when you see it."
The Republicans who control the State Senate have pushed a plan costing $703 million this year which builds on Mr. Cuomo's proposals, deepening or speeding up some of his cuts while adding others to the mix.
Democratic lawmakers have projected that the Senate plan could cost as much as $1.8 billion by 1997. To make up for that revenue loss, the state's economy would have to grow by a robust 8 percent a year, a rate the Democrats called improbable.
But the Republicans, who have not said publicly what their plan would cost in future years, argued that the Democrats failed to calculate the economic growth and improved tax receipts resulting from the tax cuts. They said the impact of their plan could be lessened by spreading their cuts over many years.
"Pick a number; if you are against tax cuts, you can make the cost as high as you want," said John A. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I. "But it can be structured so we do not find ourselves in a difficult situation."
The Democrats who control the Assembly have also pressed for tax cuts for small businesses and working poor families that would cost about $200 million this year and at least $350 million in 1995.
Some critics of the business tax cuts say they are pinpointed for specific industries, and in some cases for specific companies. "You have a coalition of special interests pushing an agenda against a tax cut of more general scope," said Mr. Brodsky, who has advocated cutting property taxes for the middle class.
One proposal by Mr. Cuomo and the Senate would benefit companies that own much property and have many employees in New York State, but sell most of their products elsewhere. Eastman Kodak, Bausch & Lomb and Finch, Pruyn & Company, a forest products company, have been among the most active lobbyists for that change, lawmakers said.
Another Cuomo proposal to give retroactive tax credits for operating losses would largely benefit securities firms. And a Senate proposal to extend the life of investment tax credits from 7 to 15 years has been strongly pushed by I.B.M., which holds a large number of those credits.

HEADLINE: U.S. Gains Trade Forum For Labor-Equity Issues

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 7

 BODY:
Sidestepping opposition from some developing nations, the United States won approval today for labor-related issues to be taken up by the new World Trade Organization that will be created when a global trade-liberalization package is formally signed on April 15.
The deal worked out today at the headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva averted the threat of embarrassing public disputes when ministers from 121 nations gather in Marrakesh, Morocco, next week to complete the so-called Uruguay Round of trade-liberalization talks. 
 Agreement on the broad outlines of the trade agreement was reached in December after seven years of difficult negotiations, but several developing countries complained bitterly that the United States was raising new issues when it proposed future debate of labor questions.
 
A New Protectionism?
 These nations, led by India and Singapore, charge that Washington is trying to set the stage for a new form of nontariff protectionism against low-wage exporting countries where workers do not enjoy the same rights and working conditions as those in the industrial world.
The United States insists that it is not motivated by a desire to blunt the trade advantage of low-wage economies, and it has been backed by France, which has frequently complained about unfair competition from third-world countries that offer their workers minimal social rights.
The dispute has focused in recent weeks on preparations for the agenda of the World Trade Organization that is to replace GATT next year. The United States is eager for the new body to be authorized so that it can discuss the relationship between trade and "internationally recognized labor standards."
As a step toward that, the American delegation sought to include a reference to labor questions in a ministerial declaration that will be issued after the Uruguay Round agreement is signed next week.
 
Viable Compromise
 Fearing that the Marrakesh meeting would be overshadowed by a dispute between industrial and developing countries, instead of celebrating the biggest trade-liberalization package to date, GATT's Director General, Peter Sutherland, scrambled this week to find the compromise reached today.
Now, labor will not be mentioned in the ministers' declaration, but the chairman of the Marrakesh meeting, Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla of Uruguay, will take note in his final statement of the "importance" some countries give to examination of links between trade and "internationally recognized labor standards."
It was agreed, as well, that "additional items" could be suggested for inclusion in the World Trade Organization's work program, a formula that will permit discussion of labor and other trade-related issues.
Although the United States gave some ground, John Schmidt, the head of the American delegation in Geneva, said, "We got what we regarded as our basic objective -- explicit acceptance that this issue will be discussed" by the World Trade Organization. Andrew Stoler, another American delegate, added, "We're very pleased with the outcome."
 
Third-World Forum
 Yet, substantive debate about international labor standards may be far away. Like GATT, the new global trade body will make all its decisions by consensus. Developing countries will be well placed to block any moves to weaken their wage advantages in trade.
The World Trade Organization will nonetheless have a broader mandate than GATT. It has already been agreed that it will discuss the environmental effects of trade. Japan has also signaled that it will raise trade and national-security concerns, so-called juridical protectionism and regional trade arrangements.
Expressing relief over today's compromise, Mr. Sutherland told a news conference in Geneva that "everything ended in harmony, " adding, "Had we started in Marrakesh on a rancorous basis, it would not have been a good signal for the start of the new organization."
He also hinted that contrary to expectations, he might not become the first head of the World Trade Organization. A former Irish Attorney General who took over the GATT post only last summer, he said he was "not prepared to express any long-term commitment to being an international civil servant."

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 13.53 Points in Subdued Trading

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher yesterday, moving from early losses to their strongest point at the close of the session. Trading was subdued after a huge gain on Tuesday and mixed results on Wednesday.
The absence of any anti-inflationary signs from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, along with a moderate advance in the Treasury market, helped to buoy the stock market. So did the release of better-than-expected retail sales for March, a day after auto makers announced strong sales for the month. Both are significant signs of strength in the consumer sector of the economy. 
 "It's still too early to tell if the market is back in a normal trading pattern," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Reich & Company, "although there was less volatility throughout the day and many players were waiting for the dust to settle."
 
 
Yesterday Was 'a Pit Stop'
 "For the moment, the wild ride has calmed down to a bit more than a pit stop," he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down more than 21 points at midmorning, closed at 3,693.26, up 13.53 points. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.83 points, to 450.88, and the broader Nasdaq composite index gained 4.45 points, to 755.17.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 289.3 million shares, down slightly from 302 million shares on Wednesday. Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues, 1,370 to 761.
Mr. Greenspan, in a speech in San Francisco yesterday, did not specifically refer to interest rates, which led many traders to conclude that an increase in short-term rates might not be on the horizon. By the end of the day, the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond had eased to 7.21 percent, from 7.24 percent on Wednesday.
 
 
Strong Gains by Retailers
 Robust sales numbers were responsible for pushing up the stocks of big retailers. Wal-Mart Stores rose 3/4, to 26 5/8; Kmart gained 3/8, to 18 3/8; Dillard Department Stores jumped 2 1/4, to 35 3/4, and the Gap rose 2 1/4, to 49.
Stocks of some of the large banking companies -- particularly those based in California, where the lagging economy may be strengthening -- also advanced. Wells Fargo rose 3, to 146 1/2; BankAmerica jumped 1 1/2, to 41 3/8, and First Interstate gained 1 1/4, to 79 5/8.
Bargain-hunting helped selected technology stocks, market analysts said. Intel rose 1, to 70 5/8, and Motorola gained 1/4, to 106 5/8.
Telefonos de Mexico was the most active issue on the Big Board. Its American depository receipts rose 1/2, to 59 3/8, a move analysts attributed to an easing of the political tension in Mexico.
General Motors gained 1 3/8, to 60 1/8, on a positive outlook for the company's sales.
 
 
Cyclical Stocks Turn Down
 Some cyclical stocks, which rise and fall on economic expectations, were lower yesterday. Caterpillar dropped 1 1/2, to 118 1/2; Reynolds Metals fell 1 1/4, to 46 7/8, and International Paper declined 1, to 66 1/8.
Shares of the Software Publishing Corporation, which said on Wednesday that it would take a restructuring charge and cut its work force in half, were down 1, to 6 1/8. Great Lakes Aviation tumbled 3 1/4, to 8 5/8, on a lower first-quarter earnings estimate by Piper Jaffray. And Molecular Dynamics plunged 3 7/8, to 6 1/8, after it said it expected a loss for the first quarter and results for 1994 that would be well below expectations.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
In big-city schoolyards, basketball backboards may become billboards.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A COMPANY that specializes in outdoor advertising is seeking to bring advertising to a new outdoor venue: basketball backboards in schoolyards.
Van Wagner Communications, best known for producing the extravagant electric billboards in Times Square, is proposing to create a National Backboard Network in the playgrounds of public schools in 11 big cities, including Boston, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and Washington. 
 Advertisers would pay a new Van Wagner division, Van Wagner Playground Programs, $187,500 to $375,000 a year to remove thousands of dilapidated, damaged backboards and replace them with new ones designed to better withstand the punishment meted out by young athletes and neighborhood vandals.
Van Wagner would also make maintenance calls every three months, handling tasks like removing graffiti, and provide emergency service to deal with problems like missing nets. Above the rim of each backboard would be a motivational public service message like "Stay in school" or "Say no to drugs."
"What initiated the concept was that backboards, for the most part, haven't been repaired or replaced in 20 years, simply because the schools have no money," said Jason Perline, chairman of Van Wagner in New York.
"There often are no rims, no backboards and sometimes no poles," he added. "The kids have had to fend for themselves." Prototypes -- about 125 new backboards -- have been installed by Van Wagner in 53 schoolyards in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens.
The proposed network represents a novel blend of two hot trends in consumer marketing. One is called place-based media, which involves introducing ads at sites where they have never appeared: doctors' waiting rooms, supermarket checkouts, airport baggage claim areas, restrooms. There is even a company, Stopwatch Entertainment, that provides electronics retailers like Circuit City with laser disks that mix programming and commercials, to be played on the television sets displayed in their stores.
The Van Wagner network would also be an example of cause-related marketing, in which corporations link themselves with social and political issues to curry favor with consumers. The most popular method is to help offer solutions to vexatious problems, from homelessness and AIDS to hunger and child abuse.
In seeking to do well by doing good, marketers' motivations are, of course, not solely philanthropic. Under the Van Wagner proposal, participating advertisers would get to turn small spaces in the upper left corners of the backboards into mini-billboards featuring their corporate logos under a "Donated by" tag. Because no advertisers have been signed, the prototypes bear the logo of the backboard network.
"It's a unique way to provide a message in a schoolyard and do something civic minded for the community as well," said Richard M. Schaps, president of Van Wagner.
For all its altruistic aspects, the idea raises the hackles of critics of the growing commercialization and commoditization of the nation's schools. No longer is the corporate intrusion into the classroom confined to food companies donating study guides to home economics classes that just happen to feature recipes requiring their name-brand products as ingredients. In the last decade, the role of corporations has broadened into previously sacrosanct realms like sponsoring curriculums.
For instance, the Eastman Kodak Company and the KmartCorporation announced last month "It's a Snap!," a curriculum for second graders that a news release said used cameras "to teach a quarter-million children about their environment and the art of photography."
The most castigated purveyor of sponsored communications aimed at students is Whittle Communications, which produces "Channel One," a news program interrupted by commercials, and has been a lightning rod for rancorous debate.
"What we object to is holding kids captive in a classroom and mandating they watch a program where commercials are an integral part," said Lyle Hamilton, manager of broadcast services in Washington for the National Education Association, the biggest teachers' union. "The purpose of classrooms is to promote ideas, not products."
Michael Jacobson, the co-founder of the Center for the Study of Commercialism, an activist organization in Washington, said the Van Wagner proposal "is certainly different from 'Channel One' because it doesn't have that compulsion." Still, he added, it represented "a continuation of a trend in which public property is privatized."
"It's really sad our playgrounds are now fair game," he added. "Ideally, corporations and wealthy individuals would be taxed so cities and park systems had adequate resources rather than relying on the whims of advertisers."
Van Wagner executives said they were sensitive to the concerns about their sponsored backboards.
The goal was for "the good to greatly outweigh any negative interpretations," said Tom Turner, the account manager. He said there would be limits on the number of advertisers and a ban on product categories like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes. Ads would also be restricted to 360 square inches of a backboard's total of 3,024 square inches.
Mr. Jacobson chuckled when told about that last stipulation. "I'm shocked by their restraint in not covering the entire backboard with the corporate logo," he said.
Mr. Hamilton said he was not sure whether his organization would object to the Van Wagner network, because it would be outside, not inside, the classroom.
"Even if it had the sponsor's motto on there, I don't even think we'd object to that," he added. "Where we part company is when they present advocacy messages, purchasing-type messages, to the children."
Among the companies the Van Wagner executives said they had contacted about possible participation are Consolidated Edison; MTV; Nobody Beats the Wiz, the electronics retailer, and Starter, which sells athletic apparel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Speculation That Rates Will Rise Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against several leading currencies yesterday amid speculation in the currency markets that American interest rates were likely to rise again soon.
"The dollar was itching to go higher before today's rumors about a rate increase," said Amy Smith, a currency market strategist at IDEA, a consulting firm. With robust economic growth in the United States, the dollar should be stronger, she said. 
 But Ms. Smith and other analysts do not expect the Federal Reserve to push up short-term rates before its next policy meeting next month. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, did not provide clues about the central bank's next step in a San Francisco speech yesterday that was the focus of the markets' speculation.
 
Dollar vs. Mark and Yen
 The dollar fell from the day's highs as talk of an increase in interest rates gave way to concern about reports showing growth in Germany's economy. Traders speculated that the Bundesbank would not have to cut interest rates as much as expected to spur German growth. German interest rates are more than two percentage points higher than American rates, making mark-denominated investments more attractive to investors than dollar-denominated ones.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7170 German marks yesterday from 1.7105 marks on Wednesday. It also rose to 104.95 Japanese yen from 104.55 yen.
Some traders bought dollars early yesterday on the expectation that Mr. Greenspan would disclose an increase in interest rates. The Fed has pushed up the Federal funds rate twice this year, to 3.5 percent from 3 percent. The rate is what banks charge each other for overnight loans.
Concern about strong economic growth in Germany kept the dollar from moving higher, traders said. "Things in Germany are looking up," said Albert Soria, foreign-exchange manager at Kansallis Osake Pankki. "The Deutsche mark appears to be a reliable bet right now."
The dollar held onto its gains against the yen, meantime, amid lingering concerns about the political troubles of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan.
"Some people in the market think they can take the dollar higher against the yen anticipating Hosokawa's resignation," said Gary Sakamoto, vice president at National Westminster Bank P.L.C. "I have a feeling Hosokawa will be O.K."
The British pound rose to $1.4740 in New York yesterday from $1.4680 on Wednesday. And the Canadian dollar rose to 72.25 United States cents yesterday from 72.14 cents.

A bit of nail biting is going on behind the scenes at art galleries and auction houses. Will the recent volatility in the financial markets and uncertainty about interest rates hurt the big New York auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art that are less than a month away?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed yesterday at close to what it was during the week of the Impressionist and modern art sales in November. But financial experts say the mood now is different than it was then: a lot of the optimism has evaporated. 
 "It makes sense that people are nervous," said Robert S. Salomon Jr., the chairman and chief executive officer of Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York City. "All the major markets of the world are under strain; there's a lot of political instability in the world. I would be surprised if this had no impact on the art market."
Traditionally, Mr. Salomon said, the cycles of the art market have reflected wealth as it moves around the world. "In the 70's, oil wealth dominated the art world; in the 80's it was led by the Japanese," he said. "Then it moved to the United States. At this juncture the question is, where is the wealth being created?"
David Nash, Sotheby's worldwide director of Impressionist and modern art, said: "The way the world works, things will balance each other out. People like Michael Steinhardt probably won't be buying art this spring. On the other hand, there are a lot of people who have realized substantial profits in the stock market. It's going to be hard to tell who's pulling in their horns and who will be spending money." Mr. Steinhardt is the prominent New York investment manager whose clients lost $1 billion of their $4.9 billion in investments in the first quarter of this year.
Robert Mnuchin, a retired partner of the Goldman, Sachs investment house, who in January opened his own Manhattan gallery, C&M Arts, said, "There may be a little caution, but it shouldn't have a significant impact on prices."
Historically, the art market has lagged behind the stock market by six months to a year, but many art experts say that what's happening on Wall Street now is simply a correction and that it won't affect buyers' confidence in art. "The key is how the economy is doing as a whole, not just the stock market, and I think the signs are good," said David Tyler, the president of Christie's in New York. "We're seeing more people prepared to spend money in art than there were three years ago."
Stephen Mazoh, a Manhattan art dealer, suggested, that "art is a good vehicle to ride the wave of inflation," but other dealers, like Brooke Alexander in SoHo, have a more cautious attitude. "The point is that the art market has been showing definite signs of recovery recently," he said, "and what's happening on Wall Street has made people nervous that this recovery will falter."
 
Museum and School
 After more than a year and a half of negotiations, the three-year-old Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center in the Westwood section of Los Angeles has agreed to be managed by the University of California at Los Angeles.
Under a 99-year agreement, the school will operate the museum with money from the museum's bond portfolio and from the operating budgets for the university's Wight Art Gallery and Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts, both of which will move into the Hammer building.
The museum's $60 million building was paid for by Dr. Hammer, the chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation until his death in 1990. Occidental provided the museum with a $35 million endowment.
The museum has had problems from the start. It ran out of money before it opened, leaving the building's auditorium unfinished. The original staff had little museum experience. When plans for the museum were unveiled in 1988, Dr. Hammer was accused of reneging on a promise to donate his art collection to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. And Occidental's shareholders unsuccessfully sued Dr. Hammer, charging the corporation had spent $95 million on his private project.
In 1990, after Dr. Hammer died, Joan Weiss, the niece and sole heir of Frances Hammer, Dr. Hammer's wife, who died in 1989, challenged the museum's ownership of its art collection. The collection consists of about 100 Old Master, 19th- and 20th-century works, estimated to be worth $450 million at the height of the art market. Ms. Weiss's lawsuit is pending, said Henry Hopkins, the museum's director. "We're setting aside a certain portion of the permanent collection in escrow," he said, "until it is settled."
Mr. Hopkins, the chairman of U.C.L.A.'s art department and a former director of the Wight Gallery, became director of the Hammer Museum under the agreement. David Rodes will continue as the director of the Grunwald Center, whose charter requires that it have its own director.
But the merger is not only administrative. It puts several art collections under one roof: the museum's original collection will be joined by works owned by the school, including a Matisse collage, and 35,000 works on paper from the Gunwald Center.
And Mr. Hopkins has been planning exhibitions. The first, "Selections From the Eli Broad Family Foundation Collection in Los Angeles," opens on June 7 and runs through Oct. 9.
 
Like Museum
 Occasionally an auction house can function not simply as a commercial venue but also as a kind of museum, a place to give the public an opportunity to see historically significant work.
When the Impressionist and modern paintings to be auctioned next month in New York go on view at Sotheby's, the auction house will also show several works to be offered in London in June. Among them will be Manet's "Bar at the Folies-Bergere" from 1881. It is the first version of the famous painting, now at the Courtauld Institute Galleries in London, which depicts a man's conversation with a barmaid against a background of spectators reflected in a mirror.
The composition of the earlier version, which is being sold by a descendant of Franz Koenigs, the German investment banker, can be seen beneath the surface in an X-ray of the Courtauld's painting. "There are differences," said Melaine Clore, head of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's in London. "The woman is looking at a different angle and the size of the man is different. He used this painting as a starting point."
Sotheby's estimates the painting will sell for $4.5 million at the June 28 auction. It will be on view at Sotheby's in New York from May 7 through 11.

MOLECULAR DYNAMICS STOCK REACHES A LOW

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The stock of Molecular Dynamics Inc. fell 38 percent and hit its lowest level ever yesterday after the company said late Wednesday that it expected to report a "substantial" first-quarter loss. The company's stock was down $3.875, to $6.125, in Nasdaq trading. Molecular Dynamics, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., also reported a 20 percent drop in revenue from the corresponding quarter a year earlier. The company said it expected its poor first-quarter results to carry over to the second quarter. The maker of instruments for life-science research attributed the weak forecast to economic weakness in Europe and the Pacific Rim and spending cuts in the United States pharmaceutical market linked to proposed health care changes.

To the Editor:
"Law as the Free Market's Rogue" (Law page, March 25) addresses the effects of law on the economy, but does not note the burgeoning empirical evidence on the issue. The one study you cite is four years old. The two most recent major articles (by Charles Epp of the University of Wisconsin and by myself) identify errors in previous research and present studies showing there is no association between the number of lawyers and economic growth. 
 One may believe the European "inquisitorial" trial system is more efficient, but where are the data? Then, too, economists get caught up in economic efficiency to the detriment of all other ends. There is considerable evidence that law, lawyers and litigation promote individual liberties, civil rights and other social objectives that might even be worth a slight loss of share value.

HEADLINE: Islamic Banking: Faith and Creativity

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN 

 BODY:
Dr. Ala-ud-Din, a dentist in San Jose, Calif., had two choices: save for years to buy a house with cash, or take out a mortgage and violate the law of the Koran.
That was until a third choice emerged. A small Islamic financing company bought the house and leased it back to Dr. Din in a 15-year deal that made him a homeowner without violating the religious law that bans Muslims from paying or earning interest. 
 While still on the far edge of American finance, Islamic banking is making inroads as several groups of bankers and Muslim scholars work to create an interest-free banking system that relies on lease agreements, mutual funds and other methods to avoid paying interest. And a new emphasis by lenders on improving service to minorities, including black, Arab and Asian Muslims, may be the key to their success.
"I wouldn't say that this is a major part of American finance, but it's definitely growing," said Nicholas Kaiser, the president of the Saturna Capital Corporation of Bellingham, Wash., which manages two mutual funds that follow Islamic law.
 
 
Lease Deals Instead of Loans
 At least six Islamic financial companies, in areas with large Muslim populations like Los Angeles, Detroit and New York, are offering mortgages and investment opportunities that comply with Islamic law.
Muslims are not allowed to pay or receive interest because the body of law of the Koran, called sharia, prohibits them from making a guaranteed profit on capital. Investors can get around the ban by making investments that involve risk, like stocks, or by carrying out lease deals rather than loans for homes and cars.
"Most of the Muslims who practice Islam would not buy houses with interest-based mortgages," said Dr. Din, who is from Pakistan.
The good news for the country's Muslims, who number three million to four million, is happening on several fronts. One group of Muslim experts is trying to put together a mortgage that complies with sharia. Others are refining lease agreements to bring them into compliance with Islam while making the agreements more palatable for lenders. And, coincidentally, car companies have embraced leasing, allowing Muslims to avoid the ethical problem of car loans.
But as Islamic banking becomes more common, some specialists warn that there is a risk that small investors will be duped by hustlers claiming to offer Islamic financial services. "You cannot invest money on faith alone, that's a very bad investment," said Vincent J. Cornell, a professor of religion at Duke University who studied Islamic banking in Malaysia.
Experts in Islamic finance say that what they propose varies only slightly from conventional banking. "The irony is that it doesn't take a lot of work, it takes creativity to convert a conventional home mortgage to a deferred payment sale" that complies with Islamic law, said Steven Thomas, the publisher of The American Journal of Islamic Finance.
Mr. Thomas, who works for a bank, has tried to use the newsletter to educate Muslims on the requirements of Islamic banking and show that it can be done in the United States. "Islamic finance is just another form of asset-based investment banking," he said.
In its most basic form, Islamic banking covers both savings and credit. Instead of being paid interest, depositors are considered shareholders and receive dividends when the bank turns a profit and lose money when it has a loss.
The Amana mutual funds, which Mr. Kaiser runs, work this way. Amana's income fund began in June 1986 and has between 1,200 and 1,300 shareholders and total assets of $11 million. Amana has relied on word of mouth among Muslim Americans to attract new investors. Its income fund has kept pace with the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, Mr. Kaiser said.
But managing the income fund is not easy. The prohibition on interest prevents investing in bonds, as well as in shares of companies that make money on interest, like banks. This makes the fund an equity fund by default.
The income fund also does not invest in companies that make or sell liquor or have gambling operations, as well as some movie studios, following the Muslim laws against drinking, gambling and pornography. The fund's advisers recently decided to stop investing in preferred stocks because dividend payments were too regular, and now puts money only in common stock.
 
 
Principles Before Performance
 "It does probably hurt the performance a little bit," Mr. Kaiser said. "Banking stocks have been a good place to be for the last few years."
Such a fund, he adds, "may not be the world's greatest investment, but it does what it says it's going to do."
On the debt side of finance, Islamic banks concentrate mainly on leasing deals. For example, a bank buys a house and leases it for 30 years to a customer, who then takes ownership. The lease payments would total more than the bank paid for the house, but that is not considered interest.
"From the Islamic point of view, if I used your asset from my benefit, you could have used it for another benefit, so I owe you," Mr. Thomas said.
The effort to construct an Islamic mortgage that is acceptable to major lenders as well as to the Internal Revenue Service is one of the most dynamic areas of Islamic finance. It comes at a time when banks are struggling to meet requirements that they lend more money to inner-city areas and minorities and when more and more Muslims command economic influence.
 
 
Banks Are Interested
 "Profitability makes banks interested," Mr. Thomas said. "There's a huge understanding that vanilla fudge mortgages are a volume business, so you have to have access to minority and niche markets." He said that a group of Muslim experts had held discussions with major lenders and that several expressed interest in the group's plan, which is scheduled for release at the end of this month.
Few lending organizations know much about Islamic banking, but they are interested. "That's the type of thing that we search out," said Julie Gould, vice president for community lending for the Federal National Mortgage Association in Washington, known as Fannie Mae. She said Fannie Mae had handled lease arrangements before and would be interested in working with Muslims as part of the association's push to better serve minorities.
Typical of the small companies in the United and Canada lending to Muslims is the MSI Finance Corporation of Los Angeles, which has arranged 25 mortgages around the country -- including Dr. Din's -- and many more car and equipment leases, said Gulz B. Joya, the company's general manager.
MSI's home leases work like this: The buyer puts down about 20 percent and MSI covers the rest in a partnership agreement. The buyer, called the resident owner, pays rent on the value of the property that MSI owns, plus a little more to increase equity.
 
 
Home's Value Reassessed
 One important difference is that the home's value is reassessed every year. If the real estate market is hot, the resident owner may feel like he or she is walking up a down escalator, paying every month while owning less and less of the house, even though the value of the resident's equity remains the same, because the house is worth more. The risk goes both ways, of course, and the California real estate slump has hurt MSI, Mr. Joya said.
Critics of Islamic banking see two problems. First, they say the banks are far from interest-free but use "interest under a different name," said Timur Kuran, an economics professor at the University of Southern California. The Muslim fundamentalist movement, he said, has helped accelerate the growth in Islamic banks, which now operate in about 50 countries.
 Others see a high potential for fraud and point to the dramatic failure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in July 1991. Even though B.C.C.I., which had Arab and Pakistani links, was not an Islamic bank, many Islamic banks made deposits in it, and thousands of people who had invested in Islamic banks lost their savings as a result.
"Because you are taking yourself out of the mainstream, there is relatively higher risk that you will be taken advantage of, and that was one of the things that happened with B.C.C.I.," said Jonathan M. Winer, who was the chief Senate investigator on the B.C.C.I. scandal.

With this service, Dr. Ala-ud-Din was able to settle in San Jose, Calif. He enjoyed his new home with his daughters. (Darcy Padilla for The New York Times) (pg. D6)
 
Chart: "Buying a House Without Interest"
 Muslims who follow Islamic law are forbidden to pay or earn interest. MCI Finance Corporation in Los Angeles Developed a lease acceptable to Islamic law and has made 25 mortgages around the country in the last five years. Here's how the lease works.
 
For a house that costs $200,000, a buyer puts down $40,000 or 20 percent. In a partnership agreement, MSI Finance puts up the remaining $160,000 and leases its portion of the house to the buyer.
 
The buyer, called the resident owner, pays rent based on the portion of the home that the finance company owns plus a little more to increase equity. As the portion of the home that MSI owns decreases the resident owner's equity increases (as it does with a standard mortgage).
 
The home's value is reassessed every year and rental payments are adjusted accordingly. If the real estate market is doing well, the resident owner's rent will increase. Although he loses no money invested, his equity will be diluted. If the home's value falls, so do rent payments, cutting into MSI's income.
 
If the resident owner defaults on the deal and MSI sells the house, the owner does not lose his equity, as could happen with a conventional mortgage. MSI and the owner split the proceeds, depending on the percentage each owns of the house.

HEADLINE: A Defense By Banker

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gustavo Gomez Lopez, the man at the center of the collapse of Banco Latino C.A. of Venezuela, emerged in New York yesterday to deny the Venezuelan Government's accusations of fraud.
He had disappeared almost three months ago after the Government shut down Banco Latino, Venezuela's second-largest bank, after a run by depositors. 
 The Government subsequently accused Mr. Gomez, who was a former president of Banco Latino, and other bank officials of embezzlement, falsifying balance sheets and other fraud charges in connection with losses estimated at $1.4 billion.
Mr. Gomez said in an interview yesterday in New York that he fled Venezuela the day after the bank was shut down on Jan. 13. He said the bank's failure was caused by politics.
"Instead of treating the collapse as a crisis," Mr. Gomez said, "the Government has turned it into a criminal scandal."
Mr. Gomez, 43, said Government officials were seeking "political revenge" because of Banco Latino's political alliances.
Mr. Gomez acknowledged that Banco Latino was crippled by the high interest rates it paid, its money-losing equity investments, the run on deposits and its inflated balance sheets. But these practices were no worse than those of other banks, he said.
He accused unnamed Government officials of floating rumors of the bank's shaky financial situation and starting the run by depositors.
Government banking officials could not be reached for comment yesterday.
The Government has attributed the bank's failure to corruption, falsified books and a reckless acquisition binge in the late 1980's that earned Mr. Gomez the nickname "Pac Man," after the video game character that gobbled up all he could reach.

HEADLINE: Long Bond Price Dips; Yield 7.25%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates rose yesterday as the bond market began to brace for two important reports on its growing obsession: inflation.
The market had started the week in turmoil as it focused on almost every hint of potential inflationary pressures -- and possible moves by the Federal Reserve to eliminate them by pushing up interest rates. 
 After calming a bit, investors and traders began to turn their attention to the Government's report on March producer prices on Tuesday, followed by the consumer prices report on Wednesday.
Yesterday, prices of Government securities were down across the board, while yields, which move in the opposite direction, headed higher. The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 17/32 , to 8728/32 , with its yield rising to 7.25 percent, from 7.21 percent on Thursday, after trading as high as 7.29 percent during the day.
The selloff in the bond market put pressure on stocks, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 19 points, to 3,674.26. [Page 38.]
 
A Tumultuous Week
 The long bond's yield of 7.25 percent is little changed from 7.26 percent a week ago, but that comparison is somewhat misleading.
On April 1, Treasury yields surged in very thin Good Friday trading in reaction to a Government report showing unexpected growth in the creation of new jobs -- and thus a signal that the economy might be overheating. The market's fears exploded further on Monday and the long bond's yield rocketed to 7.41 percent, its highest level in nearly 15 months.
Traders said yesterday's selloff was not unusual before a weekend, especially after a tumultuous week for the Treasury market and before a week filled with the release of important economic data.
 Some traders said they saw an opportunity to take profits yesterday, with the long bond near the top of its trading range in the morning. But any gains were limited by concerns that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates soon.
Several analysts said that as long as there was a chance that interest rates would rise, most rallies in the market would be short-lived.
At the shorter end of the market, bill rates increased slightly, with a three-month issue at 3.54 percent, up from 3.52 percent on Thursday.
Market analysts at MMS International said the decline in bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, weighed on Treasury securities after a Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, said labor market slack was "diminishing." They also pointed to comments by Silas Keehn, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, who said some areas of the manufacturing sector were approaching full capacity.
Kim Rupert, an analyst for MMS, said that while Mr. Keehn's comments did not help the market, they were nothing new. She said that while Mr. Keehn's remarks seemed more ominous than those of Mr. Lindsey, she did not see any near-term inflation threat.
 
Strong Auto Sector
 Historically, the high use of factory capacity has been related to inflation, so it was not unusual for the market to become concerned with the remarks of the Fed officials, one trader said. Market watchers said potentially strong inflation pressures were still keeping the market on edge.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, said Mr. Keehn might have been referring to the auto sector, which is at virtually full capacity, a condition that is not expected to last.
"Strength in consumer spending, residential housing and some inventory buildup will probably give us 3.5 percent to 4 percent in real gross domestic product growth in the first quarter, while construction and defense spending act as drags," Mr. Hoffman said.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines 19 Points, Ending a 3-Day Run-Up

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Breaking a three-day winning streak, stock traders bid down the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday by 19 points, to 3,674.26, in restrained trading. Still, the Dow finished ahead for the week by some 38 points.
As they have for the last two months, stock traders followed their counterparts in the bond market, who worried that more hedge funds were overextended and thus selling bonds at any price. More fundamentally, traders are worried that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates soon. 
 Long-term interest rates trended higher yesterday ahead of the release next week of the producer and consumer price indexes. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond settled at 7.25 percent, up 4 basis points from the previous day's close.
 
 
'Crux of the Problem'
 If the price indexes show that inflation is in check, that may convince the stock and bond markets that the Federal Reserve Board will not raise interest rates again soon. In turn, the market reaction may indeed persuade the Fed not to raise rates.
Indeed, recent market volatility has cast doubt on whether the markets will react logically to a low inflation reading. "That's the crux of the problem in the markets today," Mary C. Farrell, investment strategist for Paine Webber Inc., said.
Yesterday provided a good example of how the stock market was looking to the bond market for clues on how to invest, but bonds were following their own peculiar agenda.
There was thin trading until 2 P.M., said Christopher J. Madell, head of government bond trading for First Chicago Capital Markets in Chicago. Then a rumor swept traders that a large hedge fund was selling a huge block of 10-year bonds, sending bond prices down and yields up. As it became clear that the rumor was false, bond prices inched back up and curtailed yields.
 
 
Signs of Jitters
 For all of the yield fluctuations this week, "information-wise, nothing has changed" regarding inflation or interest rates, Mr. Madell said. He noted that early in the week the bond market had overreacted to an article in The Washington Post that said the Fed would not raise rates until the markets became less volatile. "We knew that already, but that's just a measure of how jittery the markets are," he said.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.78 points, to 447.10, and the Nasdaq composite declined 6.46 points, to 748.71. The American Stock Exchange market value index dropped 0.55 point, to 441.21.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.93 points, to 248.29, on trading volume of 264.1 million shares, about 12 percent lower than that of a typical day. Declining stocks outnumbered those that rose by 1,406 to 800.
 
 
19 Dow Stocks Drop
 Of the 30 Dow component stocks, 19 fell in price, led by General Motors, whose shares fell 2 3/8, to 57 3/4, the day after the company reported strong vehicle sales. Philip Morris, the tobacco and foods giant and another Dow component, saw its shares fall after National Public Radio reported that 5 of 13 secret cigarette ingredients were dangerous. The ingedients included methoprene, which is used in insect pesticide. Philip Morris shares fell $1.375 to $49.125.
MCI Communications, the long-distance telephone company, was the most active stock yesterday, with 3.8 million shares traded. The company announced that Gerald H. Taylor, head of its domestic operations, would become president of both domestic and foreign operations. Shares of MCI fell 1/8, to 22 1/8.
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, was the second-most-active stock yesterday, with 3.7 million shares traded on no discernible news. Its price declined 2 3/4, to 87.
Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable-television operator, was also active, with 3.6 million shares traded. The company is reported to be close to deciding whether to organize an initial public offering of its British cable holdings, which it owns jointly with U S West, the regional Bell telephone company. Shares of Tele-Communications fell 1/4, to 20.

HEADLINE: The State of the State, Proudly Restated;
Cuomo Writes the Book on New York's Strengths, and (Surprise!) Finds Much to Like

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 8

 BODY:
It is only in the next-to-last paragraph of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's new book, "The New York Idea: An Experiment in Democracy," that he explains why he decided to write a 250-page treatise about the programs, policies and philosophical underpinnings of New York State government.
"For too long -- I think -- we have dismissed our strengths, shrugged off our achievements, and allowed the headline writers to concoct the whole image of New York," Mr. Cuomo writes. "Sometimes we have even been made to doubt ourselves." 
 When he first announced that he was going to write the book, in a speech to New York newspaper publishers in 1992, he was a bit more explicit: "You have a litany of accomplishments here that are absolutely dazzling. You get no credit for them. Why? Because there is a public perception out there that New York State is New York City, and New York City is Manhattan, and Manhattan is a subway that murders people every night."
That perception, of course, is unlikely to be a political asset for an incumbent running for his fourth four-year term. And so Mr. Cuomo has set out to enlighten New York's detractors and, by implication, his own critics about the state's accomplishments of the last 12 years.
The book, which was written largely by two Cuomo aides on the state payroll, serves as something of a sequel to the collection of speeches that the Governor published last year ("More than Words: The Speeches of Mario Cuomo," St. Martin's Press). Together, they represent Mr. Cuomo's effort to define himself as an orator, thinker and policymaker and to educate a public that he suggests has been misled by negativist reporters.
Mr. Cuomo, who appears frequently on statewide and local television and radio broadcasts, said in an interview that he had been astonished at "how difficult it is to communicate the facts" about New York State.
"Your town, your village, your city are always on your mind and in your consciousness because they pick up your garbage, give you your school, protect your children," he said. "You see them in your mayor. Your President is always with you. But your governor and your state are barely visible.
"The only way to get this story told honestly and visibly is to write a book and at least offer it to serious students of the business so the truth about New York is not lost forever."
Mr. Cuomo and his editors at Crown Publishers maintain that "The New York Idea" is not intended to be a campaign book. In fact, they said, it was supposed to be published last fall, before Mr. Cuomo announced his decision to run in 1994. Delays in writing pushed the publication date to May 11. Stephen Topping, Mr. Cuomo's editor at Crown, said the book would sell for $25 and that between 15,000 and 20,000 copies would be printed for the first run. Any profits are to revert to the state.
Fearful that it would appear "like too much boasting," Mr. Cuomo said he ordered that two appendixes written for the book -- "Highlights, 1983-July 1993" and "Innovations, 1983-July 1993" -- be left out. He did decide to leave in Appendix B, a three-page list titled "National Firsts, 1983-July 1993" that includes the Child Health Plus Insurance Program, the New York State Games for the Physically Challenged and the Office of Rural Affairs.
To a degree, Mr. Cuomo's book reads like a 250-page State of the State address. In paragraphs packed with statistics that define both the state's problems and its successes, he catalogues virtually every state policy and program in existence.
No program or accomplishment is too minor to merit mention. While Mr. Cuomo devotes significant space to discussing the state's approaches to education, welfare, economic development and crime, he also finds room to mention that the Architecture Planning and Design program of the State Council on the Arts won the Thomas Jefferson Award from the American Society of Interior Designers.
The Governor does not ignore the state's failings, but neither does he dwell on them. And as might be expected, his descriptions of them can be somewhat selective.
While he mentions in a section on borrowing practices that Wall Street credit rating agencies lowered the state's bond rating a few years ago, he does not say that they are now the lowest in the country. Nor does he write that a major reason for the downgradings were the fiscal gimmicks, some outlandish and a few later ruled illegal, that the state employed during the recession, like raiding pension funds and selling state highways to quasi-public authorities.
Instead, Mr. Cuomo uses a footnote to dismiss New York's situation as part of a national trend. "Fourteen states had their bond ratings reduced by one or both of the major ratings agencies between 1987 and 1991, and only three states (as of this writing) have been upgraded since then," he writes.
 
An Activist Approach
 Mr. Cuomo also cites the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, for being "honest enough to admit in 1992 that 'the Governor who has cut tax rates the most, perhaps surprisingly, is Cuomo.' " He fails to mention that the same Cato report criticized his spending policies, gave him a grade of C, and ranked him lower than 15 of the 25 other governors who had been elected before 1990. A new Cato report issued this year again commended Mr. Cuomo for his "supply-side" tax-cutting policies, but added that "he seemingly never met a spending program he didn't like."
In his book, Mr. Cuomo defines the New York idea as "government using its resources to help create private-sector growth, then requiring those who benefit from that growth to share some part of it."
Mr. Cuomo suggests that all states should embrace such an activist approach to government out of self-interest, if not compassion. Otherwise, he writes, "We will all share in paying to maintain the number of people living at subsistence levels. We will all spend more on jail cells and police. We will all live in fear, in enclaves separated from each other's struggles -- but never free of them."
Mr. Cuomo did not write the book alone. While he is the author of the introduction and conclusion, he said much of the book was compiled by two former aides who were placed on the payroll of the State Urban Development Corporation, Luciano Siracusano and Doug Garr, who earned annual state salaries of $48,300 and $55,125, respectively, in 1993.
Despite the coincidence of the book and his campaign, Mr. Cuomo said he needed no justification to use state resources to help write the book. The same objection, he said, would have to be leveled at his State of the State speeches, his state-supported travels around New York, and even the "I Love New York" tourism campaign.
"It's supposed to tell the truth about New York on the grounds that it's good for New York State," he said. "You can't separate this from every other communication about the State of New York that's honest."

HEADLINE: Murmansk Journal;
Port Is Dying, but You Need a Tuxedo

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MURMANSK, Russia

 BODY:
If not for all the platinum blondes in little black dresses, it would be tempting to say that the world's largest Arctic city is dying.
Once among Russia's mightiest and most active ports, Murmansk now sits practically idle, the rusting hulls of a dozen ships rotting in the harbor. Thousands of workers at the enormous Murmansk Fish Cannery, one of the largest in the world, have lost their jobs because of changes in the country's economy. Most of the rest simply get paid for doing nothing. 
 Hundreds of commercial vessels have been junked and sold for scrap. And the Northern Fleet of the Russian Navy, based near here in Severomorsk, has tucked many of its nuclear submarines into the fjords north of the city and begun to slink away.
"It used to be so busy here you couldn't even move in the water," Sergei I. Greshov said as he maneuvered his tugboat about the harbor on a clear, cold day when no other ship was in motion. "Around the clock, all the time, the port was filled with people. Now nobody comes here unless they have to. And we all have less than we had before."
Everybody, of course, except for the blondes, and the tough guys in Armani suits who escort them from one nightclub to the next. Recently, the maitre d'hotel at one such restaurant called the Iceberg looked disgusted as he turned away three Americans.
"You have no invitation, no reservation and no tuxedo," he said curtly, before shutting the door. "Why would you think you could eat here?"
It is unclear how many of the city's 450,000 residents have tuxedos -- although the number is clearly high enough to keep the Iceberg in business. There are no formal-wear shops in Murmansk. Yet there is a thriving young set -- cool guys in sleek Mercedes who carry big rolls of dollars and machine guns with silencers -- enough to fill the Iceberg every night until it closes at 5 A.M.
As much as any Russian city, Murmansk displays the surreal contrasts of a nation where anything goes for those who are crass, smart, deadly or lucky enough. The aching gulf between the rich and poor grows more apparent every day. Apartment blocks with names like Arctic 77-B and Polar 176 stand in long ugly rows along the edge of the tundra. There are, on average, only 14 clear days a year here. When the sun sets on Nov. 29, it does not rise again until the middle of January.
Gloom is an accepted part of life here. But even for Russia, with all of its current problems, Murmansk has fallen on particularly harsh times. Most people are scraping by on smaller paychecks and less government support.
According to the Regional Office of Statistics, the standard of living here has plummeted over the last three years, since the Soviets stopped subsidizing nearly every aspect of life in the industrial arctic. Good bread -- at 40 cents a loaf -- costs 10 times what it did last year.
Less meat, milk and vegetables were produced in the district in 1992 than at any time since 1965. Industrial production here has fallen 25 percent each year since 1991. Exports from the port fell in each of the last three years. Schools closed, construction stopped.
Salaries, which were once higher than in Moscow, now average less than $60 a month, down by 50 percent. In the mid-1980's, with 4,500 heavy ships calling at Murmansk each year, every day began with the radio announcement of which ships were due to arrive. Now, with one or two boats slipping into town on a good day, the announcements have been stopped.
The train station, a pastel green monument to Stalin's neo-classical obsession, used to run 19 locomotives a day from this, the northernmost passenger depot in the world. Now the number is nine, mostly to Moscow and St. Petersburg.
"It's dirty, really dirty," Pavel V. Lukianitz, a 28-year-old member of the army special forces, said as he stepped off the Polar Night train from St. Petersburg recently. He used to work on one of the nuclear-powered ice breakers that were fixtures on the waterfront.
When the Government ran out of money to operate them, he was transferred. "The train used to be such a pleasure from here," he said. "Now we just hold our nose and hope to get where we are going."
Along with many residents of Murmansk, Mr. Lukianitz has never heard of the Medved ("bear" in Russian), a fancy new club only a mile from the train station that caters to the sharp set.
Inside on a recent evening, at red leatherette banquettes, about a dozen men sat with their blonde dates, smoking endlessly and drinking Hungarian champagne. For $100 a plate, everyone seemed happy with their sodden roast beef and salty salmon. A man in slicked hair and a pale blue dinner jacket danced with a woman in a diamond necklace whose dress kept slipping off her shoulders as she shuffled slowly beneath the mirrored ceiling.
"We are a new class of Russians, a private club," said Anatoly D. Tretvoskov, the manager. "We do not want publicity or interference."
When asked how his members earned their handsome livings, he smiled and uttered the word on so many Russian lips these days. "Entrepreneurs," he said. "They are all entrepreneurs."
But down at the docks they have another word for it.
Unloading a month's worth of frozen cod and sole, several local fisherman explained the economy in terms that most of Murmansk could understand.
"We take this fish and we sell it at the market," said one of the fishermen, a lifelong Murmansk resident. None would be quoted by name because they were afraid of the "mafia."
"We don't sell our fish to the factory anymore because they steal from us and they are fools," the fisherman said. "We stay away from the fancy businessmen because they want all our profits. We don't export anything because the tax collectors and the customs men steal it all. We do the work, and they get the money. That is the new Russia."

HEADLINE: U.S. Goals on Trade Ebbing With Japan Reformer Gone

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
The res ignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan has deprived the Clinton Administration of the agent of change it was counting on to open Japan's closed markets, and it has left the White House uncertain it will achieve its trade objectives with Tokyo anytime soon.
Mr. Hosokawa was widely viewed by American officials as the Japanese leader most willing to accommodate American demands for more open markets. His downfall is expected to lead to a period of political weakness and uncertainty in Tokyo. 
 American officials believe that in the short run it is not likely that any Japanese figure will emerge strong enough to make the hard decisions Washington is demanding.
 
Reality Sets In
 Some analysts wonder whether the Clinton Administration did not exaggerate Mr. Hosokawa's willingness to accede to American demands, much the way it built up President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. In both cases, the United States seemed to be counting on reform-sounding leaders and seemed unaware that they were steadily losing public support.
Whatever the case, the Hosokawa resignation raises certain tactical questions for the Administration, most notably whether to proceed with its policy of steadily increasing the pressure on Tokyo with the threat of trade sanctions.
President Clinton, asked about the Hosokawa resignation, said: "I do not expect there to be a marked deterioration in our relationship with that country. We're too important to each other and to the rest of the world."
 
Viewing the Options
 The three leading contenders to replace Mr. Hosokawa inspire little excitement in Washington. The leading candidate is Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who once said that the Japanese could not import more American beef because Japanese intestines could not fully digest American hamburger.
Another candidate is former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, who once said that the problem with America is that blacks do not pay their credit card bills. The third likely option is some sort of coalition spearheaded by the Socialists, the most protectionist party in Japan. And a fourth is a minority government that is hardly likely to have the strength to push through reforms.
Many of the President's top economic, foreign policy and trade officials gathered at the White House this morning for a discussion of where to go from here. For the moment, the line is to stay the course.
"Sometimes in trade, as in life, patience is a virtue," said the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor.
Mr. Kantor added, though, that the United States would continue to look for "meaningful steps by Japan" to reduce its $131 billion global trade surplus and to eliminate market access barriers.
American officials remain convinced that this is the direction that the Japanese public wants to take. Some analysts are not so sure.
"Hosokawa's fall demonstrates the fallacy of the view that somehow a new political leader was going to emerge, be the savior, change the Japanese system, resolve the trade conflicts with the U.S. and spare us having to take difficult measures to solve the problems," said Clyde V. Prestowitz, Jr., head of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research center that advocates a hard-line approach to Tokyo.
"The power center remains the bureaucratic mandarins and big business cartels, who do not want to see the kind of change we are advocating."
American officials note that they are not taking the pressure off of the bureaucrats. One thing the Americans believe they have going for them is that currency speculators have kept the value of the yen very high against the dollar. That makes all of Japan's exports more expensive and squeezes Japan's export-oriented business community. American officials hope these business leaders will squeeze the bureaucrats to agree to a market-opening arrangement.
But this is a delicate game. President Clinton does not want to have to resort to punitive trade sanctions, aides say, which he knows would undercut political cooperation in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue and other global problems.
Sanctions also run the risk of triggering a trade war that would unhinge global markets.
A few weeks ago, President Clinton told aides he wanted to keep the pressure on Mr. Hosokawa, but not "to rub his nose in it." In return, Mr. Hosokawa offered Mr. Clinton a sketchy package of unilateral measures he was prepared to take to open Japanese markets. The fate of that whole package is now highly uncertain.

HEADLINE: Japanese Coalition Scrambles to Replace Premier

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 8

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's announcement today that he would resign sent his governing coalition scrambling to form a new government and to salvage at least some of the economic and political reforms Mr. Hosokawa promised when he took office last year.
Mr. Hosokawa's sudden resignation nonetheless appeared to usher in a new period of political instability that Japanese and American officials feared could slow, and possibly derail, his program to empower consumers and urban voters and deregulate a country choking on bureaucracy. 
 Emerging as a front-runner as a successor to Mr. Hosokawa was Tsutomu Hata, the Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, who is also known as a champion of reform but is regarded as less articulate and politically appealing.
Throughout the country, there was a palpable sense of disappointment that Mr. Hosokawa, a 56-year-old former Governor of a southern prefecture who took office promising to rid the political system of corruption, had fallen prey to precisely the kind of financial scandals he had denounced.
With his informal style and attacks on vested interests, Mr. Hosokawa swept into office on a wave of demands for change among voters tired of nearly four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party, which was seen as protective of the bureaucracy and big business in Japan.
He achieved a sweeping change of Japan's electoral system, including new curbs on campaign contributions and a vast redistricting that promised to make elections more open and competitive. He also opened Japanese rice markets to imports for the first time and apologized to the country's Asian neighbors for Japan's aggression in World War II.
But in recent months, under increasing attack, Mr. Hosokawa lost his focus and was quickly overrun by many of the forces he was trying to combat. His approval ratings suffered, although at a current level of around 50 percent, his popularity remained high by Japanese standards.
Supporters of Mr. Hosokawa insisted today that he had begun an unstoppable tide toward economic and political reform, and that it would continue no matter who is chosen. But they acknowledged that their first mission now is political survival.
The governing coalition consists of some rebels who broke from the Liberal Democratic Party, along with the Socialists and members of smaller longtime opposition parties.
There were many predictions today that the coalition could splinter apart in the battle to find a successor to Mr. Hosokawa. Such a step that could even bring the Liberal Democrats back to power, although most analysts regarded the chances of that as remote. Also considered remote were the chances of a new election.
Mr. Hosokawa, appearing at a news conference today, had lost his usual self-confident air. "I sincerely apologize to the people of Japan," he said. "Many reforms are still under way and have not been completed, and my role will now be different. But I will continuously work toward the fruition of the goals we set."
The man who came to office with a reputation as Japan's cleanest politician left many questions unanswered about his financial connections to a trucking company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, that spent much of the 1980's buying influence from the country's leading politicians.
The company has also been linked indirectly to Japanese gangsters. Mr. Hosokawa took what he described as a loan of nearly $1 million from the company in 1982. Though he insisted that he had paid back the principal, he conceded today for the first time that he did not pay the interest on the loan. Instead, the interest was diverted and "used for my political activities," he said.
He said he had decided to resign after receiving other specifics about how his office had let "an old personal friend of mine," whom he did not identify, profit from the management of other political funds when he served as Governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, in southwestern Japan.
Many of the details remained vague, and it was unclear whether any laws were broken. Nor was it clear that Mr. Hosokawa had been trying to cover up or simply had been misled by his staff.
The Clinton Administration had invested heavily in Mr. Hosokawa's success, and counted on him to bring about reforms that would make Japan's markets far more open.
The disappointment today was evident in the face of Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador here.
"I'm very sad," the former Vice President said. "I liked Hosokawa, I consider him a friend, and I feel very sorry for him."
"Here is a guy who offered a new Japan," Mr. Mondale continued. "He appealed to the young; he had a Kennedy-esque appeal; he talked about political reform, administrative reform, opening Japan to the world, finally responding to the consumers. There was such hope. Here was the fresh political persona, coming from prefectural politics, and ending up in charge of a system that needed so many changes."
 
Possible Scenarios Cited
 Amid the chaotic juggling for position under way in Tokyo today, three rough scenarios for the creation of a new government have been sketched out -- none of them very promising for the Clinton Administration's goal of speeding up the process of reform and opening the Japanese market.
The simplest calls for the elevation of Mr. Hata as prime minister. After Mr. Hosokawa, he is clearly the most personally popular member of the Government, a former bus company executive who helped lead the revolt last summer that ousted the Liberal Democrats after endless scandals.
But Mr. Hata will probably not be acceptable to the Socialists, the biggest party in the coalition. He is closely associated with Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's most powerful politician and the other end of the coalition's ideological spectrum from the Socialists.
Another, more drastic scenario involves a deal in which Michio Watanabe, a former Foreign Minister and leader of one of the biggest factions in the Liberal Democratic Party, would abandon that party and join the Hosokawa coalition.
In return, Mr. Watanabe, who is believed to be suffering from cancer, would fulfill a lifetime dream and become prime minister.
But Mr. Watanabe would have to bring 40 so members of his political faction from the Liberal Democratic Party with him to the coalition. Even that might not compensate for the loss of roughly half the Socialists, who would undoubtedly bolt the coalition if Mr. Watanabe took office.
A third scenario involves stalemate. If neither the Liberal Democrats nor the coalition can put together a convincing majority, the country could be run, at least in theory, by a minority government. But it would be so weak that few believe that it could last. That would be the worst case for the United States, because it would leave the bureaucracy even more free to run the country in the absence of political leadership.
 
Surprise to Close Allies
 Mr. Hosokawa's decision came as a shock even to some of his closest political allies.
"Just yesterday afternoon I had a long discussion with him, and he indicated many points on how he planned to overcome his difficulties," said Hajime Ishii, a leader of the Shinseito party and one of the Prime Minister's key strategists in Parliament. "His feelings must have changed quite suddenly."
Others suggested that Mr. Hosokawa had simply been outmaneuvered by his enemies in the Liberal Democratic Party, who skillfully used the investigation into his past to bring Japan's Parliament to a halt.
They held the national budget hostage, demanding that Mr. Hosokawa allow his private political secretary to testify under oath.
Mr. Hosokawa received little aid from allies in his own party. The Socialists regularly abandoned him on key votes. The chief Cabinet Secretary, Masayoshi Takemura, who is supposed to act as the Prime Minister's spokesman, has publicly feuded with Mr. Hosokawa for several weeks.
"I think the psychological pressure on him was enormous," said Mr. Shimada, a longtime adviser to Mr. Hosokawa. "He had too many enemies surrounding him, and he could no longer survive."

HEADLINE: Fed Official Disputes Times Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A top Federal Reserve official said yesterday that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, continued to exert strong leadership of the committee that determines interest rate policies.
William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, disputed a report in The New York Times yesterday suggesting that top Fed policy makers had limited Mr. Greenspan's leeway in changing interest rates. 
 The Times article said that the policy makers of the Federal Open Market Committee had taken over the process of raising and lowering rates, rather than allowing Mr. Greenspan to act on his own in the period between meetings.
"The viewpoints expressed in today's New York Times are nonsense," Mr. McDonough said in a statement. "They are completely opposite to my experience as the vice chairman of the F.O.M.C. Alan Greenspan continues to exert strong leadership in the committee, built on the great respect we all have for him."
Asked for comment, Joseph Coyne, press secretary at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, referred a reporter to Mr. McDonough's statement.
Mr. Greenspan is chairman and Mr. McDonough is vice chairman of the committee, the central bank's policy-setting body. It comprises the 7 Fed governors based in Washington and 5 of the 12 presidents of the regional Fed banks.
The committee issues guidelines for setting short-term interest rates in the six-to-eight-week periods between meetings. Until recently, Mr. Greenspan usually carried out those directives on his own, or after consulting with his colleagues in a conference call. But at the committee's meetings on Feb. 4 and March 22, the policy makers as a group raised the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. They were the first increases in five years.
The Times quoted several Federal Reserve officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, as saying the new approach was a sign of growing reluctance to delegate authority to any single person, but did not imply criticism of the Fed chairman or his leadership. The report said the change had evolved through consensus, had not been challenged by Mr. Greenspan, and was partly a response to pressures from Congress for more openness in the central bank's decision-making process.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Hits 5-Month Low On Bearish Housing View

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber prices plunged their daily trading limit yesterday, setting a five-month low, amid speculation that housing demand would not be as robust this year as thought.
The drop in lumber prices helped send the Commodities Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities down 0.82, to 223.78. 
 Lumber for May delivery fell $10 for its 10th straight daily decline at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, settling at $349.10 for 1,000 board feet. Lumber prices have fallen fell 28 percent so far this year.
Higher interest rates are choking off an expected surge in building activity this year, sending lumber prices lower, traders said. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.47 percent this week, up from 6.74 percent as recently as October.
The rise in interest rates prompted the National Association of Home Builders to lower its forecast for new housing starts in 1994 to 1.392 million, from 1.432 million earlier.
 
Builders 'Not Confident'
 Builders are "not confident the building season is going to be as buoyant as they thought a little while ago," said Bill O'Neill, chief futures strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Lumber mills are loaded with inventory that they cannot sell, traders said, further depressing prices.
"I've just been hearing there's an awful lot of footage on the docks" waiting to be shipped, said Edy McCartney, a lumber buyer for Parr Lumber in Portland, Ore.
Such excess supply has sent prices for delivered lumber falling as much as $35 for 1,000 board feet over the last week.
On other commodity markets, platinum prices fell after South Africa's political leaders took new steps in their efforts to stop the political violence in Natal province. South Africa is the world's largest producer of platinum and gold.
Platinum for July delivery sank $3.30, to $407 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Other precious metals prices were little changed. June gold rose 20 cents, to $386.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange, while May silver gained 3.5 cents, to $5.492 an ounce.
Elsewhere, gasoline prices fell as refiners sold production to take advantage of rising prices. May unleaded gasoline dropped 0.36 cent, to 48.46 cents a gallon, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Other petroleum products were narrowly mixed. May crude fell 1 cent, to $15.57 a barrel, and heating oil gained 0.25 cents, to 45.06 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Slightly on Yen Amid Tokyo Political Shift

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar made a small gain against the Japanese yen yesterday after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned amid questions about his personal finances, raising concern about Japan's political future.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.26 yen, up from 104.95 yen on Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo, it jumped as high as 105.80 yen after Mr. Hosokawa's resignation was announced, but soon retreated. 
 A country's currency often falls during political crises. The yen did not drop further against the dollar because many traders thought the change in leaders could delay resumption of the trade talks between Washington and Tokyo that broke off in February.
Without progress on trade, the Clinton Administration could resume calls for a strong yen, traders said. The dollar plunged more than 20 percent against the yen last year after the White House said a strong yen would curb Japan's $60 billion trade surplus by making Japan's exports more expensive.
"You can read Hosokawa's resignation in many different ways," said Lynn Tierney, a trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston. "The question for currency traders is whether this is going to slow down the trade talks or speed them up."
Mr. Hosokawa was expected to provide details by June on a package of measures aimed at opening Japanese markets to American goods. His Foreign Minister, Tsutomu Hata, is scheduled to meet Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, in Morocco next week.
In trading against the German mark, the dollar fell in New York to 1.7130 marks, from 1.7170 on Thursday. The decline came because traders sold yen for marks, a move that often requires them to sell yen for dollars, then sell dollars for marks.
Traders in Tokyo drove the dollar higher against the yen just after Mr. Hosokawa resigned. The rise was short-lived because Japanese exporters sold the dollar to take advantage of its rise. Japanese exporters often have dollars to sell because they earn revenue in foreign currencies.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar rose to a six-week high of 72.50 United States cents, from 71.76 cents on Thursday, buoyed by signs of strength in the Australian economy.
"There's a real love affair with the Aussie dollar going on," said Richard Tauberman, a trader at the Westpac Banking Corporation. "People see a lot of growth and no inflation in Australia."
The British pound rose to $1.4765 from $1.4735 late yesterday. And the Canadian dollar was virtually unchanged, at 72.25 United States cents.
