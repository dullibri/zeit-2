Long lines outside the best colleges are likely to get longer.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IT'S the season for choosing colleges and, by tradition, time to lament the astounding cost of America's elite private institutions. Astounding is no exaggeration: tuition at the Ivy League schools and their competitors has increased fivefold in the last two decades, nearly double the rate of inflation.
The most common explanation is that brand-name colleges are isolated from the market forces that keep the price of a Camry within shouting distance of the price of a Taurus -- and the price of both within the budgets of middle-income Americans. But Gordon Winston, co-director of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, paid for by the Mellon Foundation, offers a radically different perspective. The scarcest resource at the high end of higher education, he argues, is talented students, rather than money. And the competition for these students dramatically favors schools that already enroll the best and brightest, creating an unbridgeable quality gap between the typical college and what he calls "the snooties." 
 Colleges cannot be analyzed like ordinary businesses, Mr. Winston argues, because they do not seek profits. And a good thing, too: in 1990-91 the average four-year private college or university spent $10,600 a student and got back just $3,400 in tuition and fees. Williams, where Mr. Winston teaches, charged an average of $11,500 for services that cost $40,000 to deliver. So while money matters, colleges obviously have something else in mind.
One goal is attracting better students. Brand-name schools with hefty endowments offer the prestige, superior education and amenities the "customers" crave, generating long queues for admissions. But unlike profit-seeking businesses, colleges do not take excess demand as a signal to expand. Expansion, after all, would leave less subsidy available per student, undermining the institutions' efforts to attract the very best.
The excess demand, reflected in rates of rejection as high as 88 percent at Harvard, feeds on itself. For starters, it validates perceptions that the colleges are the best, much the way long lines outside restaurants reassure first-time patrons that they have chosen wisely.
More important, Mr. Winston suggests, good students are a key part of education, creating the environment for learning that has as much to do with the results as the teaching. Thus a college able to choose from a huge pool of applicants can sustain quality without outspending less prestigious institutions. And success begets success, increasing the pool of students seeking the most value for a tuition dollar.
This is not quite the end of the story. Rich, aspiring second-tier schools -- for example, Emory University in Atlanta -- use discounts to lure students otherwise bound for the snooties. Indeed, Rice University in Houston garnered a place among the elite by charging no tuition at all.
But for all the schools' efforts, Mr. Winston notes that the pecking order as measured by popular perceptions has not changed much. And while a handful of contenders may wait in the wings, schools that are already members of the inner circle have the cash to fight back with discounts of their own, should they see the need. In short, Mr. Winston is convinced that the top tier of higher education is what the economists Philip Cook of Duke and Robert Frank of Cornell call a "winner take all" market -- that is, a few dozen colleges and universities will increasingly distance themselves from the run of the mill.
Most people would probably not be troubled by the prospect. After all, elitism rooted in achievement rather than birth is as American as 30-year-old bond traders driving Ferraris. But Mr. Winston worries that the unusual incentives for colleges make it unlikely that the elite will ever open their doors to larger numbers.
Over the next decade, he estimates, college enrollment will increase by 10 to 30 percent. But private schools, which currently spend two or three dollars for every dollar they recoup in tuition, have powerful reasons to hold the line on size. More ominously, Mr. Winston argues that much the same pressures are now at work at the best state-supported universities.
Some first-rank state universities, he notes -- notably those in California --are acutely aware that legislators are in no mood to offset the dilution of subsidies, should they decide to expand enrollment. Others, notably the University of Michigan, behave more and more like private schools as the proportion of their income from private sources rises.
All this implies that it will become ever harder to get into top-ranked schools, private or public. And with growing scarcity may come diminishing tolerance for admissions policies that weigh diversity along with merit: if affirmative action raised hackles in the 1980's and 1990's, watch what happens when a third more students are competing for the same number of places in class.

Rate of Expansion Slackens in Region

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The New York City regional economy continued to expand in April, but at a significantly slower pace than was the case through most of last year, a national business group said yesterday.
The report, by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which surveys its members about changes in corporate outlook and spending on everything from raw materials to office chairs, said its business conditions index slid slightly in April to 50.9 percent from 51 percent in the preceding month. 
 The April figure was the weakest month-to-month change since February 1996, and only the second under 51 percent since June 1995. Anything under 50 percent is considered a contraction, while anything over 50 percent indicates business expansion.
The association's report said that the nonmanufacturing side of the local economy showed signs of a contraction in April but that a speeding of business activity among manufacturers kept the index in positive territory. The index of future economic outlook by the group's members in the region also suggested continued growth, improving slightly, to 67.4 percent, from 64.6 percent in March.
Last year, purchasing managers were more optimistic. In 6 out of 12 months in 1996, the outlook index for the region was over 70 percent, the association said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Broadly Higher, Buoyed by U.S. Output Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose modestly yesterday, bolstered by a report that the United States economy grew in the first quarter at its fastest pace in more than nine years. The strong figures on the gross domestic product partly offset the effects of a report Tuesday that showed unexpectedly mild labor costs.
Traders said the output data increased the possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at its May 20 meeting. Higher rates tend to enhance a currency's value. 
 Speculation on a rate increase was heightened further after the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Jack Guynn, told a business group in New Orleans that the first-quarter G.D.P. growth was "faster than most of us had expected." Mr. Guynn is a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee.
Jan Alvarez, senior foreign exchange trader at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia, commented on the data: "They're strong numbers, so we're looking at a stronger dollar. The robust growth tells us the Fed will hopefully raise rates at its next meeting."
Yesterday, the dollar touched an intraday high of 127.13 Japanese yen before settling in New York at 127.06 yen, up from 126.87 late Tuesday. The dollar settled at 1.7303 German marks, up from 1.7243.
The dollar also strengthened against the British pound, which retreated to $1.6237 from $1.6316, partly on uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Britain's general election today. Although the Conservatives are expected to lose power to the Labor Party, questions among some about Labor's margin of victory raised the possibility of an indecisive government. "If there's a slim majority for either party, and it's likely to be Labor, it would be harder for the new government to govern," said Michael Malpede, foreign exchange analyst at the Refco Group in Chicago. "That put some pressure on the pound."
The dollar's advance against the yen was muted by speculation that the Japanese central bank would intervene to keep the yen from weakening further. Tatsuya Enomoto of Sumitomo Bank in New York said the dollar had been indirectly restrained, as well, by the yen's strength against the mark.

HEADLINE: Terrorism's Worldwide Toll Was High in 1996, U.S. Report Says

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
International terrorist attacks killed 311 people worldwide last year, one of the highest death tolls recorded, the State Department said today in its annual report on political terror.
Nearly 200 of those deaths were the work of the Tamil Tigers, a separatist group in Sri Lanka, the report said. 
 Once again, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, the Sudan, Syria and Cuba are on the State Department's list of nations that sponsor such attacks. But the report said that only Iran, by assassinating dissidents abroad and supporting violent groups, was directly linked to any of the terrorist bombings and killings last year.
No international terrorists struck the United States last year, the report said; it made no mention of the midair explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800 off Long Island in July, which killed 230 people. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is still not sure what caused the disaster.
And no attack anywhere in the world last year came close to the April 1995 explosion that killed 168 people at a Federal office building in Oklahoma City. A United States Army veteran with far-right views is on trial in Denver in the case.
"Domestic terrorism," the report said, "is probably a more widespread phenomenon than international terrorism today," taking a far higher toll in nations like Sri Lanka, Algeria, India and Pakistan as well as the United States.
Still, 24 American citizens died in international terrorist attacks last year. Nineteen were killed in the June 25 truck bombing at an American military base near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Five more died in bombings and shootings in Israel.
The Dhahran attack remains unsolved. "Eventually, we are going to get to the bottom of this," John Lewis, the F.B.I.'s assistant director for national security, said today.
The 296 international terrorist incidents recorded in 1996 represented a 25-year low, and most were minor blows against commercial targets that killed no one. The deadliest attacks were carried out by the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka. The group carried out the biggest bombing of 1996, an explosion in downtown Colombo, the capital, that killed 90 people in January, and it blew up a commuter train in July, killing 70.
The second-deadliest group of 1996 was the Islamic Resistance Movement, better known as Hamas, whose most militant factions want to establish an Islamic Palestinian state in place of Israel. A Hamas suicide bomber blew up a bus in Jerusalem on Feb. 25, 1996, killing 26 people, including 3 Americans. A second struck a Tel Aviv shopping mall a week later, killing 20.
By the State Department's definition, nations cannot commit acts of terrorism, only "subnational groups or clandestine agents" who carry out "politically motivated violence" against innocents. If a nation's air force bombs civilians, that is not terrorism; if civilians blow up a plane, it is.
But nations can sponsor terrorist groups and agents. The seven nations on the State Department's terrorism list are barred from receiving United States military and economic aid or importing American-made items that can be used for military purposes.
Still, the report said, there was no evidence directly linking Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, the Sudan or Syria to acts of state-sponsored international terrorism in 1996. Only a Presidential order can remove a nation from the terrorism list. Only one nation -- Iraq -- has ever been removed. That decision, in 1982, came while Iraq was at war with Iran, and it was reversed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Good Profits Spur Stocks, But Aid Case For Rate Rise

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average moved to within striking distance of its all-time closing high yesterday on the back of better-than-expected corporate earnings and relief that the economy's strongest quarterly growth in nine years has not led to a surge in inflation.
With the results in from most of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, overall profits are about 3.7 percent above forecasts, according to I.B.E.S. and First Call, two companies that monitor earnings performance, continuing a string of 21 quarters of increases. And the first quarter's increase in wages and compensation turned out to be less than expected. 
 But that good news, which helped spur the remarkable April rally in the stock market, could have another side: The strong economic growth that helped produce the better-than-expected earnings could be just what prompts the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again, even if the inflation news is still subdued. After all, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has made it clear the Fed wants to be pre-emptive, acting before inflationary pressures are clearly apparent.
Put another way, the stock market seems to be following interest rates, and even better-than-expected earnings will not be enough to give stocks a lasting lift as long as there is upward pressure on rates.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company and one of the more optimistic equity strategists going into 1997, summed up the difficulty in the outlook with this question: "The quarter was good, but is it going to result in another move by the Fed to raise interest rates?"
And Ms. Cohen raised another issue that may have to be resolved before the stock market can break out of its current trading range and move to significantly higher levels: comfort with the prospects for 1998. Investors, she said, will first have to be reasonably confident that earnings will be positive next year and that the economy will continue to grow moderately while inflation remains in check. "I think it's a little early for that," she said. Her current forecast for 1998 is an 8 percent increase in earnings, but other forecasters are seeing less growth and some are forecasting declines.
This may all seem like irrelevant babble right now, after the Dow Jones industrial average has jumped 9.7 percent in the last two and a half weeks and finished yesterday just 76 points from the previous closing high of 7,085.16, reached on March 11.
But the questions about the outlook for the stock market have not really changed, even with the relief from inflation worries brought by the Employment Cost Index for the first quarter, which came in with a lower-than-expected increase of six-tenths of 1 percent . Or with some signs that the sharp growth of the first quarter, when the economy grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, may be slowing.
The key unanswered question is whether the Fed will move to raise rates again, maybe as soon as the May 20 meeting of its policy-making committee. Given the surprising selloff after the first interest rate increase in March -- one that seemed to be fully expected by investors -- another one could rock stocks again.
Before the Fed thinks it can hold its fire it will need to see that the economy is growing at a slower pace than it did in the first quarter. While there are some signs of slowing, according to Robert V. DiClemente, the chief domestic economist at Salomon Brothers, there are not enough yet. "It is still a go for May 20," he said of the prospects for a rate increase by the Fed.
Comments last week by a Fed governor, Laurence H. Meyer, appear to bolster the view that a slowdown great enough to keep inflationary pressures in check has not yet occurred, though they came before this week's reports. While the Employment Cost Index was in check during the first quarter, the gross domestic product price deflator, another gauge of inflation, rose 2.3 percent in the first quarter, above the 1.5 percent pace in the last quarter of 1996.
Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, shares these concerns about the market's current prospects.
He has raised his overall earnings forecast for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index by $1, to $45 a share. But to him that just means that the economy is getting stronger, which will prompt the interest rate increases by the Fed that he predicts will, again, knock the stock market for a loop. And this time, he said, there will be a steeper decline than the 9.8 percent swoon that followed the first Fed rate increase on March 25.
Consequently, he has been selling into this "wonderful rally," last week raising the cash position in his model portfolio to 8 percent from 5 percent and looking forward to raising it again soon. "You should enjoy this and sell into it," he said.
Ms. Cohen, however, is encouraged by the strong earnings reports of the first quarter and the economic news of the last three weeks. There has been good news on several fronts, she said.
Even with this year's rise in the dollar, which is up 9.8 percent against the Japanese yen and 12.2 percent against the German mark, overall earnings have not been reduced significantly.
There are signs, she said, that the economy may have ended the first quarter on a weaker note than it began. And she said, inflation remains restrained.
Price data issued yesterday by the Chicago Purchasing Management Association reinforced that belief and helped the stock market rally after it had fallen on the report of the surprisingly strong economic growth in the first quarter. Ms. Cohen also said that interviews with companies have shown that the rise in labor costs was not yet putting pressure on prices.
But because not all of the major sectors of the economy have reported, she would not say whether she was lifting her earnings forecast for the whole year, which was for an increase of 10 percent. She has said that the Dow will rise by about as much as earnings, or to around 7,050, a point it first hit in February.
"The last three weeks have followed a pattern I would like to see," she said. "But we need to watch forthcoming data closely," especially the April employment report due tomorrow and retail sales later this month.
And, she added, "the Fed will still be meeting May 20" and "we still need investors to be comfortable with 1998."

HEADLINE: Peter Coleman, 77, Governor of American Samoa

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Peter Tali Coleman, a native of American Samoa who was its first popularly elected Governor, from 1978 to 1985, died on Monday in Honolulu. He was 77 and a longtime resident of Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa.
He had liver cancer, Agence France-Presse reported. 
 Mr. Coleman, a lawyer, was appointed by the Eisenhower Administration as Governor of the unincorporated territory in 1956, and held the office until 1961. After becoming the first popularly elected Governor in 1978, he was re-elected in 1980. He was prevented by the territory's Constitution from running for another term in 1984, but five years later he was again elected Governor, serving to 1993.
He also was the founding chairman of the territory's Republican Party, serving from 1985 to 1988.
American Samoa consists of seven small South Pacific islands, with a total area of 76 square miles, and is 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii. It is the most southerly of all lands under United States sovereignty, and has been under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department since 1951. Its population was 46,773 in 1990.
Mr. Coleman was born in Pago Pago to William Patrick Coleman and the former Amata Aumua. After serving with the Army in the Pacific in World War II, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from Georgetown University in 1949, and later received a law degree from Georgetown.
Mr. Coleman was a Pacific area analyst at the Interior Department in Washington in 1951 and 1952; a public defender, planning officer and customs officer in American Samoa from 1952 to 1955, and the territory's Attorney General in 1955 and 1956 before being appointed Governor.
From 1961 to 1965 Mr. Coleman was district administrator of the Marshall Islands, part of the United States-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and was the Acting High Commissioner of the Trust Territory when he resigned in 1977 to run for governor.
Governors appointed by Washington served in American Samoa until 1977, when a plebiscite in the territory mandated its first election for governor. Mr. Coleman defeated his Democratic opponent, Aifilili P. Lutali, after a campaign centered largely on economic issues.
Mr. Coleman's influence extended well beyond his home islands. A champion of regional cooperation, he was a co-founder, in 1980, of the Pacific Basin Development Council.i In 1980, he and the Governors of two other United States possessions in the Pacific, Guam and the Northern Marianas, joined with Gov. George R. Ariyoshi of Hawaii to draw up a $1.4 billion, five-year economic development plan for their islands.
Among Mr. Coleman's survivors are his wife of 55 years, the former Nora Stewart, and 12 children: William Patrick, Peter Talifiliga, Milton John, Amata, Bruce Joseph, Charles Ulualofaigna, Richard James, Paul Vaelaa, Barrett Francis, Alan David, Sina Ellen and Limonmon Mary.

HEADLINE: Goldman Says It Will Buy Asset Adviser

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In its latest move to expand and diversify its asset management business, Goldman, Sachs & Company said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Commodities Corporation, a managed futures, currencies and commodities investment firm.
Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, but people familiar with the transaction said that Goldman was paying about $100 million for Commodities, a subsidiary of Stockton Holdings Ltd., a privately held company based in Bermuda. 
 The purchase is the third that Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the firm's global asset management division, has made in less than a year. Last fall, Goldman bought CIN Management, one of the largest managers of British pension funds. And in January it purchased Liberty Investment Management, with $5 billion in its portfolios.
The Commodities Corporation, based in Princeton, N.J., was founded in 1969 by a group of economists and investors, including Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel laureate. It has about 100 clients and manages a little less than $2 billion in assets. The firm oversees a variety of independent managers investing money in the commodities and currency markets for wealthy clients and institutions.
Many Wall Street firms, seeking steady fee income, have tried to strengthen their asset management businesses by going after firms with strong presences in the stock and bond markets.
But in buying the Commodities Corporation, Goldman, Sachs is sending a different message, executives in the futures business said.
"The real news here is that one of the sharpest firms on Wall Street has just made a fairly public entry into a business that has always been considered tangential," said Burt Kozloff, president of Select Advisers, a Greenwich, Conn., firm that represents four commodity trading advisory firms.
"When I see Goldman going into the managed futures business, it leads me to believe there is promise in this area," Mr. Kozloff said.
The Commodities Corporation has been the training ground for a number of prominent traders, including Paul Tudor Jones and Bruce Kovner, and retains its relationship with them by doling out money for them to manage.
"Commodities Corporation has a number of managers who run money for them and may run money on the outside," John P. McNulty, co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said. "They don't see them as a threat at all, and maintain very good relationships with those guys."
Goldman, Sachs already has a commodity business, J. Aron & Company. But Mr. McNulty said the Commodities Corporation is not in a complementary business.
"What it does is different from J. Aron, which provides markets to clients as a dealer and also does some trading for its own account," he said.
The Commodities Corporation runs two funds. One invests money for clients in Japan and Europe and the other for American investors.
Over the last decade, the fund for foreign investors has returned an average of more than 20 percent a year, Mr. McNulty said. The return on the other fund has been a few percentage points less.
With the acquisition, Goldman becomes the third Wall Street firm to own and operate a managed fund business. Merrill Lynch & Company and Dean Witter, Discover & Company offer similar services.
Along with these other firms, Goldman will market the funds to institutions and wealthy individuals as a diversification tool as well as a way to reduce overall risk.
To date, that sort of argument has done better with foreign investors than it has in the United States. But use of managed futures is gaining credence with institutional money managers in this country.
The acquisition of the Commodities Corporation, which is subject to approval by various Federal regulators, is expected to close in about three months. When it does, Goldman will have approximately $110 billion in assets under management.
That figure is twice what it was a year ago, but still leaves Goldman, Sachs far short of competitors like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. in the asset management business.

HEADLINE: Many Stores Found to Sell Cigarettes to Minors

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Last week, a lanky 17-year-old with a silky smooth face, turned-around baseball cap and knapsack visited Liberty International, a convenience store in the Bronx, to buy cigarettes and test a state law that forbids the sale of tobacco to minors.
He had no problems purchasing cigarettes at that store. Or the next store. Or any store, for that matter. 
 "He was like Ken Griffey Jr.; he went 5 for 5, including a cigar," said Jose Maldonado, New York City's Consumer Affairs Commissioner. "I was shocked. These retailers should be ashamed of themselves."
The youth was among eight high school students who helped city inspectors conduct an undercover sweep that led to 15 citations -- including 11 three-time offenders whose tobacco sales licenses may now be revoked.
The sweep, conducted April 22 to 24, was the fourth such raid in the last year as part of the city's "Three Puffs and You're Out" campaign against retailers who sell tobacco to those under 18.
Under state law, tobacco sellers cannot sell to anyone under 18 and must request photo identification from customers who appear younger than 25.
Sellers must also post signs stating that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.
Merchants who violate the law face citations and fines of up to $100 per violation, as determined by the Department of Consumer Affairs and the Health Department.
A second violation carries a penalty of $500. A third violation carries a $1,000 fine and possible one-year suspension of the merchant's tobacco sales license.
Since 1994, the Department of Consumer Affairs has conducted undercover operations that have resulted in 20 revoked licenses and the collection of $196,000 in fines.
In the latest, all but 3 of the 47 stores surveyed were previously cited. Of the 11 stores found in violation a third time, 4 were in Manhattan, 3 in Queens and 2 each in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
There was one encouraging statistic. When the raids began in 1994, more than 60 percent of stores surveyed were found to be violating the law; in the most recent sweep, 30 percent were violators.
"The key here is not to destroy a business or a business's economic well-being," Mr. Maldonado said. "The key is to send a strong and unequivocal message that you can't profit at the expense of a young person's life."

HEADLINE: Media More Likely to Show Women Talking About Romance Than at a Job, Study Says

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
Across a broad range of media, in films, in television, including commercials, and in magazines for teen-agers, women are more likely to be shown preoccupied with romance and personal appearance than they are having jobs or going to school, according to a new study released today by Children Now, a children's advocacy group based in Oakland, Calif.
The study, conducted by Dr. Nancy Signorelli of the University of Delaware, for Children Now and the Kaiser Family Foundation, also showed that despite the fact that women make up a majority of the population, most characters -- 63 percent in movies and 55 percent in television -- were men. In music videos, 78 percent of performers were men. 
 But the study did find that women in television shows, and especially in movies, were portrayed as "using intelligence."
"Television clearly makes an impression on kids today, whether it's what they think they should look like or the qualities they associate with men and women," Matt James, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in a statement accompanying the study. "The media is a powerful tool that can either reinforce negative stereotypes or present strong role models."
The study was released in conjunction with a conference in Los Angeles on Children and the Media. It is believed to be the first to look at representations of women across a spectrum of media.
"What we are seeing is a constant, cumulative, omnipresent picture," said Lois Salisbury, president of Children Now. "And it's hard to get away from. A girl could mute the ads on her television set, but still get it on the program. She could turn off her television, but she's going to get it at the movies. She could decide just to read, but she would have to boycott most popular magazines for girls."
The study was conducted in fall 1996 and reviewed 23 top-rated television shows, 15 movies, three weeks of top 20 music videos and 4 issues of leading magazines for teen-age girls: YM, Sassy, Teen and Seventeen.
On television, the study found, 41 percent of men were shown working, as opposed to 28 percent of women. In movies, the difference was more striking, with 60 percent of men and 35 percent of women shown working.
In both television and films, women were more likely than men to talk about romantic relationships.
In magazines for teen-agers, 35 percent of articles were about dating, while only 12 percent discussed school or careers, and 7 percent discussed sex, including sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancy. Only 3 percent of articles focused on drugs and smoking.
In movies, women were more likely than men to have their looks commented upon, and in all media, women were more likely than men to be perceived as thin or very thin.
In a national survey conducted by Lake Sosin Snell & Associates that accompanied the study, 400 boys and 400 girls, ages 10 to 17, were asked whom they most admired on television. The top 10 selections for boys were all men, including Michael Jordan, Tim Allen and Bart Simpson. But 8 out of the top 10 girls' choices were also men, including Will Smith, Martin Lawrence and Jonathan Taylor Thomas. The girls also named Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell.
Still, the pollsters found it good news that women in film and television were shown as intelligent and as problem-solvers. In movies, 69 percent of women were shown using their intelligence, and in television, 34 percent. Self-reliance was stressed in 35 percent of female characters on television and in movies, and in 28 percent in magazines for teen-agers.
"We were looking at whether characters thought things through quickly," said Nancy Signorelli, who helped design the study, "whether they were proud of what they did know, and were not playing dumb."
Ms. Salisbury cited Grace in ABC's "Grace Under Fire," as an example of an intelligent, self-reliant character.
"She is a single, working-class mom raising a couple of kids," Ms. Salisbury said. "The show constantly shows her struggling with boyfriends and economic problems, and solving them."
Dr. Jane Brown, a professor of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Carolina, who has studied how girls use media to define themselves, said of the study: "Girls are looking for role models who are powerful, in control of their lives and have some purpose. Now there are more powerful women in the media -- Roseanne on television, for instance. But girls are still looking for role models, and they're hard to find."
"We are where we have always been," Ms. Brown continued. "We are finding the same preoccupations among girls, with being attractive enough to lure a male. Women are seen primarily as sex objects. That is what we were concerned with 20 years ago."

HEADLINE: Blair or Major? Britain Is Choosing Today

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 30

 BODY:
Britain's election campaign came to an end tonight with the refashioned Labor Party of its young leader, Tony Blair, maintaining its substantial lead in the polls and threatening a rout of the long-dominant Conservative Party showing the wear of 18 years in office.
While the possible change of administration from Conservative to the newly centrist Labor Party would not mean a radical change in the way Britain is run, a victory of the proportions being predicted would significantly shift the country's political landscape. 
 The Labor Party approaches election day unified, full of fresh energy and disposed to take center stage, while the Tories are divided, depleted and facing a bruising and distracting struggle for leadership of the party if they lose.
"I understand why some people may find the argument for change attractive," Prime Minister John Major, 54, said at a news conference at party headquarters today. "Eighteen years is a long time," he said, sensing the obstacle he has been unable to overcome in the six weeks of electioneering. "The electorate knows us warts and all."
Six weeks is also a long time for a British election campaign -- the last one of that duration was in 1918 -- and Mr. Major had scheduled it that way in the hopes that with enough time the public would start to credit his Government with the country's economic recovery and return the Conservatives for a fifth term.
Everyone with an opinion at the outset thought the tactic would surely reduce Labor's lead, if not overcome it, but the numbers never budged and Mr. Major's opponents put the extra time to their own use, convincing the voters worried about Labor's convulsive past that responsible "New Labor," as Mr. Blair calls it, was here to stay.
Under Mr. Blair, 43, the Labor Party has been profoundly transformed, abandoning its trade union, statist past and becoming a champion of entrepreneurship and individual enterprise. The goal of the project has always been to make Labor, a party that has never succeeded in holding office for more than one term, into an acceptable mainstream alternative to the Conservatives, who have governed Britain for 35 of the last 50 years.
Mr. Blair has visibly gained confidence and stature in the last six weeks, and Mr. Major has seen his leadership undermined by members of Parliament caught in sexual and petty corruption episodes and candidates defying his "wait and see" position on Britain's ties to Europe.
Meanwhile Labor was running a campaign using American promotional and organization techniques crafted to be disciplined, non-provocative and low-risk. Labor some time ago ceased to be the party of cloth caps, beer and sausages, and, as the campaign wore on, even its signature red color became soothing purple.
As strait-laced as their candidate, campaign workers made pledges of abstinence for the duration of the campaign, and the strategy manual preached "remind, reassure and reward," with uppercase first letters. It was recited by campaign aides with no evident self-consciousness.
Today Mr. Major expressed his frustration with the stylized campaign's apparent success, saying voters should not fall for "the false attraction of a well-packaged marketing scam." He also said that the prosperity under the Tories was "too good to give up" and that "one cross in the wrong place on the ballot paper tomorrow could wreck everything we have achieved together."
Mr. Blair ended his campaign the way he began it, with a visit to a school, in keeping with his handlers' eagerness to stress his commitment to improving education. Then he went to his constituency of Sedgefield in Northern England, where he said at his political club that the country now had "24 hours to build that great, decent British society."
In the last election, five years ago, the Tories ground down Neil Kinnock, then the Labor candidate, with well-timed charges about the party's unstated plans to raise taxes and succeeded in the final days in frightening voters away from Labor.
This year Labor cut off that line of assault by first attacking Mr. Major for having raised taxes himself during his term in office and then pledging that Labor would stay within Tory spending limits for the next two years and not raise income taxes for the next five.
But perhaps the most effective turn of the tables occurred over the issue of pensions. Earlier this year the Conservatives presented a daring plan to start shifting the growing costs of pensions from the state into private accounts for young people. Existing pensioners were specifically exempted from the proposal.
Labor, caught unequipped with any credible approach to the problem of how to finance pensions, turned it to their political advantage. They asserted, with scant evidence, that the Tories were posing a threat to everyone's pension. In a country with as many people living on pensions as Britain, that is an incendiary charge, and the Tories found themselves on the defensive with Mr. Blair posturing as the protector of the aged.
The Tories reacted with fury, and Mr. Major was reduced to accusing Mr. Blair of telling "damnable, scurrilous, bald-faced lies." It was a replay of 1992, with Labor suddenly commanding the political high ground and Tories on the run.
In aping many of the Conservative positions on cherished initiatives of theirs like privatization of utilities, Labor has succeeded in stealing the Tories' most defensible campaign argument, stewardship of Britain's finances.
"It's all about image in terms of the ability to manage the economy effectively," said David Sanders, professor of politics at Essex University. "The reason the Conservatives are in so much trouble is that they have lost that reputation, while Labor have managed to present themselves as a plausible set of economic managers."
One indication of the calm with which a Labor victory is being anticipated is evident at the London stock market. Five years ago a possible Kinnock victory took average prices down 17 percent. This year, with Labor far in the lead the whole campaign, stocks rose 9 percent.
Today the bookmakers William Hill refused to accept any further bets on the election because of what it said was the certainty of a Labor victory. The last time the company closed its books on an election was in 1979, when Margaret Thatcher began the longest unbroken stretch of one-party rule in Britain this century.

The Players and Their Parties
 
The Conservative Party has been in power since 1979, and John Major, 54, has been Prime Minister since he succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990. Once unified and formidable at election time, the Tories now suffer from deep divisions over Britain's relationship with Europe and face a leadership struggle if they lose today.
 
Founded by trade unions at the turn of the century, the Labor Party long believed in big government, nationalization of industry, and taxation to redistribute wealth. But under Tony Blair, 43, and his two predecessors Neil Kinnock, leader in the 1992 election, and John Smith, who died in 1994, Labor has become a centrist party that endorses free markets, entrepreneurship and privatizing utilities.
 
The Liberal Democratic Party is the third party in Britain, successor to the various alliances and parties like the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party that have tried to occupy the middle ground between Labor and Conservative. Its leader since 1988 has been Paddy Ashdown, 56. It is the only party to propose a tax increase of 1 percent, for education, and is the most open to Britain's further integration in Europe.

HEADLINE: Russia Is True to West, in Its Fashion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 30

 BODY:
When President Boris N. Yeltsin wants to play the nationalist card he simply rolls out the red carpet for the United States' most vexing rivals and bitter adversaries.
In recent weeks, Russia has ostentatiously turned toward the East, inviting officials from China, India and Iran. Mr. Yeltsin has posed for the cameras hugging the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, and Russian officials have boasted of fashioning a "multipolar world" in which the United States would no longer be the dominant player. 
 The Kremlin's aim is, in part, to tweak the United States, which many in the Russian foreign policy establishment resent for promoting the expansion of the NATO alliance and winning the cold war.
But for all the symbolism, Russia's talk of a new strategic partnership with the East is more theater than substance. Even when they are not awaiting the American Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, who arrives here on Thursday, Russia looks mostly to the West and the West's financial institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, for money, technology and acceptance.
That was underscored this week when Anatoly B. Chubais, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister and a leading reformer, flew to Washington to seek the I.M.F.'s blessing -- and financing -- for Russian economic reforms.
And despite its vocal opposition to NATO expansion, Moscow is still seeking an accommodation with the Western alliance. The focus of Ms. Albright's visit will be a proposed NATO-Russian charter.
Though substantial differences remain, Moscow's calculation appears to be that NATO's expansion is inevitable and that the charter should be concluded and used to play up Russia's importance in world politics.
It was Mr. Yeltsin, not Western leaders, who urged that the charter be concluded and signed by Russian and NATO nations on May 27, well in advance of the July meeting of NATO nations when the alliance plans to invite East European nations that were once part of the old Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to begin the process of becoming members.
To be sure, the Yeltsin Government has several motivations in turning to the East. Politically, it enables Mr. Yeltsin to play to nationalist sentiments at at home.
Yevgeny Primakov, the former Russian intelligence chief and Middle East specialist who was appointed Foreign Minister before last year's presidential election, abandoned the pro-Western tone of his predecessor Andrei V. Kozyrev. Addressing nostalgia for the days of Soviet power, Mr. Primakov emphasized Russia's relations with other former Soviet republics as well as Asian and Middle Eastern states.
Economics is a factor as well. China is a growing market for Russian arms.
India is also an arms customer and a potential buyer for Russian nuclear technology. The United States has urged Russia to drop its plans to sell two nuclear reactors to India, arguing that it breaches a 1992 agreement among nuclear suppliers. But Russia has defiantly insisted that it will proceed with the multibillion dollar sale.
Iran, which is treated as a pariah by Washington, is also a market for Russian weapons and civilian nuclear technology.
To bolster its beleaguered nuclear establishment, Russian has agreed to sell Iran a nuclear power plant despite Western warnings that the project will help Teheran's program to develop nuclear weapons. Russia, however, has been careful not to completely defy Washington. It has promised to turn off the arms spigot with Iran once existing contracts for conventional weapons are filled.
Iraq is attractive to Russia because it has oil, which Russian companies want to help develop. Iraq also has substantial debts to Moscow, which will not be repaid unless international sanctions against Baghdad are lifted.
Russia's turn toward the East reflects more general foreign policy considerations, as well. Russia no longer has the global role the Soviet Union played, but it remains a regional power and the contacts with Asia enable Moscow to maintain a measure of influence abroad.
But while playing the Asian card may feel good, it is not a strong hand. Russia's need for economic investment, for technology, for inclusion in Western institutions is deeper than the gains in may receive from feting Chinese or Iranian leaders.
Nor does the overture to the East strike a powerful chord among much of the Russian public, which craves Western goods and which remains deeply skeptical of Islamic states like Iran and of the Chinese.
More important, as concerned as American officials are with Russian arms sales to China and Iran, few in the West take Moscow's tactic of turning to the East too seriously.
"At various points, Soviet and Russian foreign policy have turned to the East," observed a senior Western diplomat. "But these are relatively short-term phenomena. Russia realizes that its key interests require it to stay engaged with the West."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Gingrich View Hong Kong as Test for China

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
President Clinton pronounced himself "quite satisfied" with the assurances on the future of Hong Kong he received today from the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, but said he was waiting to see if China's words matched its actions.
The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, warned today that China's favorable trading status depends upon how Beijing handles the British colony's transition to Chinese rule. 
 Clinton Administration officials have said repeatedly that they regard the way China handles its reassertion of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 as an "important benchmark" for the larger United States-China relationship.
But for a widening coalition in Congress, in an atmosphere where China is viewed as a rising rival to American power, the transition is seen as a litmus test for the entire relationship with Beijing and a way to hold Mr. Clinton's feet to the fire.
Mr. Qian spent the last three days here meeting Administration officials and Congressional leaders with two purposes, American and Chinese officials said: to prepare for the state visit this autumn of the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, and to reassure the Americans about Beijing's commitment to preserve the autonomy and free market of Hong Kong.
Mr. Qian met President Clinton for 40 minutes today, discussing issues ranging from Hong Kong to China's growing trade surplus with the United States, now nearing $40 billion by some accounts. White House officials said that Mr. Clinton made an "especially strong presentation" to Mr. Qian on "the need to redress and reduce any barriers to freer trade."
Better market access is the American requirement for China to join the World Trade Organization, and Mr. Clinton told Mr. Qian that "were the Chinese in a position to make a bold proposal, we'd be in a position to make a bold response," a White House official said. He said the United States still hoped that agreement could be reached with China this year on the terms of its membership in the organization.
On Tuesday, Mr. Qian said that under China's rule "the democracy, freedoms and human rights enjoyed by the Hong Kong people will be more extensive" than under British colonial rule, which introduced more freedoms only in the last few years. He promised that Hong Kong would have autonomy "unmatched in the world" and would be governed solely by local officials approved by Beijing.
Asked about Mr. Qian's assurances today, Mr. Clinton said: "We had a good discussion about Hong Kong, and he assured me that China intended to observe the terms of the agreement of 1984 that they made with Great Britain and that the United States supported back then. I was quite satisfied with what he said. And I certainly hope that it will reflect Chinese policy."
Mr. Gingrich, in a speech today, was able to be more direct, given his position as Speaker of a Republican-dominated House and his own recent trip to China and Hong Kong. If Beijing did not live up to its commitments to preserve democracy, human rights and a market economy in Hong Kong, he said, "there would be serious long-term damage to our relations" and China's relations with the rest of the world. On the other hand, he said, "if Beijing handles the transition well, it will substantially brighten its future relations with the United States."
Speaking at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Mr. Gingrich said explicitly that he supports legislation to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status for only three to six months. That would allow Congress to monitor the transition in Hong Kong and debate renewal again in September or December.
Under current legislation, the President must certify annually that China deserves to retain its low-tariff trading status with the United States. Congress then has 60 days to pass a law overturning his certification and then to override his veto, should that be necessary.
Despite the furor over China, if all goes well with Hong Kong Administration officials do not believe Mr. Clinton will need to use the veto this year. Mr. Clinton's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, indicated skepticism today that Mr. Gingrich's proposal to shorten the renewal would pass. Asked to comment, he said: "We'll just see if it goes anywhere."
Mr. Qian has publicly denied allegations, attributed to unnamed officials at the F.B.I., that officials at the Chinese Embassy in Washington talked among themselves about giving money illegally to influence the American election campaign. Mr. McCurry confirmed that the F.B.I. Director, Louis Freeh, briefed Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, about the bureau's inquiry on Monday, after the White House discovered that the bureau had first briefed legislators.

HEADLINE: Audits Indicate Misuse of Funds By Aid Agency In Harlem

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Over its 23-year history, the Harlem Urban Development Corporation received almost $100 million in state funds to help rebuild Harlem. Millions of dollars were spent on lawyers, hundreds of thousands went for telephone calls around the world and perks like cellular phones and cars, and hundreds of thousands more are still unaccounted for.
And when the agency was dissolved two years ago, state officials say, it had not produced a single major commercial project. 
 Internal audits released yesterday by the Pataki administration portray an agency with few controls, where state money sloshed freely with little regard for contracting procedures or documentation. One lawyer who had a contract for $28,750 wound up being paid $171,591. Some employees were classified as "consultants" by the corporation, which failed to withhold as much as $1.5 million in state and Federal taxes from their paychecks.
The revelations of the inner workings of the development corporation, which for a generation was the prime hope for re-development in Harlem, has prompted a criminal investigation, an official in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said yesterday. The State Commission of Investigation is also examining the agency's activities.
The Harlem agency has been the target of periodic criticism over the years, but yesterday's report was by far the most comprehensive and most damning portrayal of its efforts. And while the audit did not single out individuals for criticism, it was likely to come as a political blow to some prominent Democratic politicians who were closely identified with the agency, including Representative Charles B. Rangel.
Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said the audits he released showed "mismanagement and a lot of wasted dollars."
Mr. Gargano said signs of trouble were apparent for years in audits that were publicly available. The Pataki administration replaced the development corporation with a new entity, the Harlem Community Development Corporation, that is monitored directly by the Empire State agency.
But some former members of the development corporation's board contended that the audits were politically motivated. "I have no idea what the findings are based on," said Mr. Rangel, who was a major force in the organization during its entire life. "You have a bunch of Republicans going through the files of a defunct organization run by Democrats."
Mr. Rangel said he pushed for the release of the audit after some details appeared in the press earlier this year. "If someone abused public funds," he said, "I think they ought to be brought in and investigated."
He said he had no day-to-day involvement in the corporation. "I don't read any audits," he said. "I just bring the money home and assume we can get good people to do something. If that wasn't done, I don't want to hear about it 23 years later."
Donald J. Cogsville, who was the president and chief executive officer of the corporation, declined to comment, saying he has not received copies of the material released by state officials.
Among the 33-member board were many prominent politicians who were ex officio members, including the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, and H. Carl McCall, now the State Comptroller, who was a State Senator.
Leland Jones, Ms. Messinger's spokesman, said that she had sent representatives to the meetings and that there were no indications of the allegations of widespread mismanagement in the materials released yesterday.
But City Councilman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. said the problems were clear to him during his three years on the board. Mr. Powell, a political opponent of Mr. Rangel, whom he called "the 500-pound gorilla over H.U.D.C.," said, "Too much money was spent, and there was not enough to show for it."
State officials said the Harlem development corporation operated independent of the major state development entity, now the Empire State corporation, receiving its money directly from the State Legislature and subject to little review.
William J. Stern, who headed the state development corporation under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, said the Harlem agency operated independently because "it was considered a kind of political turf for the Harlem pols -- it was their thing, so to speak." He said politics, not development strategy, gave the Harlem corporation its independent power. "They gave people jobs," Mr. Stern said. "I think it was a pork-barrel operation. I said so at the time. I didn't see any economic development."
The audits released yesterday by the Empire State corporation harshly criticized a wide swath of the Harlem corporation's operations.
The reports said the corporation "repeatedly and exclusively gave noncompetitive contracts to a limited group of vendors, consultants and contractors." Then, the memo said, it managed the contracts poorly.
For example, in 1995 the corporation paid J & L Enterprises $485,000 for expenses related to managing a city parking garage that had been built by the corporation. But state officials charge that between $150,000 and $200,000 represented either services that were never delivered or overcharging for services. Among the expenses described as unnecessary were $1,775 in legal fees and approximately $2,000 a year in telephone bills.
In addition, a 1990 city audit of the garage operations determined there were hundreds of thousands of dollars missing or misappropriated. And the city, in a lawsuit filed last year, claims the Harlem corporation failed to pay the city $2.8 million in rent.
Although the parking garage, on 125th Street, is one of the corporation's development successes, it also represents its unfulfilled promises. The garage was supposed to be the foundation of the Harlem International Trade Center, which was never built. While the agency did provide funds for the renovation of housing in Harlem, help lure small businesses to the area and aid in the renovation of the Appollo Theater, it was not seen as having been a force for large, wholesale rehabilitation.
Indeed, state officials said, the corporation spent three times as much on personnel, overhead and consultants as it did on its capital budget. One lawyer, Jeff Greenup, was hired on a contract to perform legal services for the corporation in addition to serving as counsel to the corporation's board, "an apparent conflict of interest," the state memorandum said. The corporation's auditors, Mitchell & Titus, entered into a contract "not to exceed $78,000" in 1995, but wound up billing $237,000 for that year. Another company was hired to perform data entry work, and one person was paid $90 an hour, including travel time from Connecticut.
Even the corporation's office and petty cash fund did not escape the auditors' scrutiny. About $22,000 was spent for a staff retreat at the Concord Resort Hotel in October 1994. Another $1,650 was spent for waxing and washing the corporation president's car.
After the election of Mr. Pataki, the board hired a lobbying firm for $44,000 to help negotiate the changing political waters. But the new Governor dissolved the agency and the lobby contract became another expense that state officials said was unjustified.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. PLAYOFFS;
Sonics Sputtering Again In Round 1

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, April 30

 BODY:
The 3-point line may be the ruin of him either that, or Shawn Kemp's clock radio -- but, then again, George Karl has struck this sorry pose before. His Seattle SuperSonics have again saved their worst for the first round, and four crises in four years confirms there is a hole in their infrastructure.
Karl has a four-guard offense to solve, not to mention the erosion of a certain power forward, and he has 24 hours to do so. Last June, his team was trapping Michael Jordan into oblivion, but now the Sonics' coach is afraid to trap Kevin Johnson or Jason Kidd, for fear of an early summer. The seventh-seeded Phoenix Suns lead this three-of-five-game series, 2-1, and Karl is resorting his lineup, snipping at the referees and dialing his agent. 
 "I'll put it in my contract that I don't coach the first round," he said today on the eve of Thursday's crucial Game 4.
The Sonics own the Pacific Division title, won 57 games, have averaged 55 victories over the past five seasons and are about to go out in the first round for the third time in four years. They may have pushed the Bulls to six games in last season's league finals, but that was only a month after they lost a first-round home game to Sacramento, recovered to win the series in four and then celebrated with Dom Perignon.
This time, there may be no escape. It is either Kemp's fault for sleeping through meetings and practices, or center Jim McIlvaine's fault for not living up to his $33.6 million contract, or guard Nate McMillan's fault for tweaking his knee, or center Sam Perkins's fault for averaging 4 points in this series, or guard Gary Payton's fault for not erasing Phoenix's soon-to-be-retired Johnson.
It is either Suns Coach Danny Ainge's fault for designing the offense of the 21st century or Rex Chapman's and Wesley Person's fault for draining about every 3-point shot in sight, but the best moment for Seattle in this odd series was Kemp falling on Johnson's left ankle late in Tuesday's night's Game 3.
Johnson -- who Karl complains gets every referee's call when he drives to the basket -- sprained the ankle, spent today at an acupuncturist and will decide at game time on Thursday whether he can play.
"If I were in Vegas, I'd bet he'd play," Karl said. "Anyone want to put any money on it?"
Phoenix's other calamity Tuesday night was forward Cedric Ceballos's courtside collapse. He spent the night in a local hospital, was ruled to be dehydrated and was expected to play -- again not to Karl's surprise.
In fact, other than Game 2's mirage of a 44-point Sonic victory, Karl has spent this series in a self-professed purgatory. His contract runs one more season -- at which time he will probably retire and wait for Dean Smith to quit the University of North Carolina -- and it appears no one will beg him to stay.
He has complained openly that players are celebrities now and that the game is entertainment now, and that even one of his "best, hardest-working guys" knows the shoe deal of every player in the league. The game has changed, economically and esthetically, and he can barely tolerate it.
For instance, the Suns have a four-guard offense that is foreign to every team in the league. "In the East, they walk it up, throw it in the post and play inside out," Ainge said today. "We play outside out."
The 3-point line is apparently too close for Phoenix to pass up. Chapman made nine 3-pointers to win Game 1, Person made six to win Game 3, and Ainge admitted today: "That 3-point line is not there for decoration. So, we've got to use it."
Seattle, meanwhile, is too big to chase Phoenix's whippets and has fallen into the dangerous trap of taking too many 3's itself. Kemp had only one fourth-quarter field goal in each of the Sonics' losses, and he is the one who was supposed to seize Jordan's throne this season.
Instead, Kemp missed three weeks of training camp to protest McIlvaine's contract, and he has suffered from what some team officials describe as depression. He has missed flights, meetings and practices, and has done nothing to change the Sonics' image as a troop of loose cannons.
Payton, who scored 34 points in Game 3, is, incredibly, their most reliable player, and this is the same extrovert who nearly fought former teammate Ricky Pierce during another first-round loss, to Denver, in 1994. Karl, it turns out, has been more baby sitter than coach the last four years, and appears ready to turn in his pacifier.
"We're fine," the Sonics' president, Wally Walker, said. "Of course, if we lose the series, we're not fine."

Growth Soars to 5.6% Rate With Inflation Modest
Powered largely by free-spending consumers, the economy grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate during the first quarter. It was the biggest advance in nearly a decade and came in well ahead of forecasts.
The Clinton Administration claimed credit for the continued robust growth, which has been accompanied by modest inflation, but acknowledged that it was surprised by the strength of the results. [Page B12.] 

Administration officials predicted that the surge would help drive down this year's Federal budget deficit to the lowest level in more than 20 years. [A1.]
 
Stocks Extend Their Rally
Stocks continued to rally, as strong corporate profits apparently outweighed in traders' minds any inflationary implications of the report on economic growth. The Dow industrials roared back above 7,000; since April 11, they have gained 9.7 percent, reversing the biggest downturn in more than six years. Other indexes also rose, with broad measures strongly positive. [D8.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling to 6.95 percent, from 6.98 percent on Tuesday. [D18.]
 
Keyboard Verdict Is Overturned
A judge threw out a $5.3 million verdict against Digital Equipment, setting back plaintiffs who seek damages from computer keyboard makers for injuries to users. The judge said new evidence suggested that the crippling wrist injury suffered by an executive secretary was most likely caused by a muscular condition in her neck. [D4.]
 
Goldman, Sachs to Buy Firm
Goldman, Sachs agreed to acquire the Commodities Corporation, a managed futures, currencies and commodities investment firm, reportedly for about $100 million. [D4.]
 
$460 Million Deal for Insurer
The insurer Conseco, continuing a string of acquisitions that helped its earnings more than double in the first quarter, agreed to buy a unit of Leucadia National for $460 million. [D5.]
 
U.S. Investigates Cellular Bidding
The Justice Department is investigating accusations that bidders for cellular telephone licenses may have illegally manipulated recent auctions. [D2.]
 
Black Employees Sue U.P.S.
Sixteen black employees filed a discrimination suit against United Parcel Service, saying they had been angered by racist graffiti and blocked promotion paths. [D4.]
 
Teledesic's Task Is Daunting
Teledesic, despite awarding Boeing a $9 billion contract for 250 satellites, faces years of challenges to its ambitious plan to establish an "Internet in the sky" to deliver high-speed voice and data communications globally. [D4.]
 
Saatchi's New Ads for Delta
Saatchi & Saatchi introduced its campaign to promote Delta Air Lines' new trans-Atlantic business class -- in effect, a polished version of the pitch Saatchi used recently to win the overall Delta account. The ads feature a recurring image of a lone passenger inside a minimally appointed fuselage made to look like a private room. Advertising. [D7.]
 
An Agreement on Meat Trade
American and European negotiators reached an agreement on meat inspection standards, but were unable to resolve their differences over the handling of poultry. [D5.]

To the Editor:
Colleen J. G. Clark (letter, April 28) says she is unaware of valid data demonstrating that higher cigarette taxes lead to less smoking. Our research demonstrates that there is a strong negative relationship, particularly among teen-agers. 
 A 1981 National Bureau of Economic Research study by Michael Grossman, Eugene M. Lewit and Douglas Coate found that a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes reduces the number of youth smokers by 12 percent. Our 1996 research suggests that a 10 percent increase in price would reduce the number of teen-agers who smoke by 7 percent and would reduce the daily number of cigarettes consumed by teen-agers by 6 percent.
Our study implies that if the proposed 43-cent increase in cigarette taxes were enacted, the number of teen-age smokers would fall by 16 percent.

HEADLINE: Mayor Expects Record Surplus For Fiscal Year

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that New York City would finish its fiscal year with $800 million more than his budget experts predicted less than a year ago.
The surplus -- largely the result of soaring profits on Wall Street -- gives the Mayor another chance to propose new spending plans and cuts in taxes when he presents his election-year budget next week. He said he wanted to devote some of the surplus to new spending on education and law enforcement, two areas that voters are likely to scrutinize during the mayoral campaign. 
 In general, the Mayor said, he would allocate the extra money by following a formula that he first discussed in January, dividing it up roughly evenly between what he described as "three pots": new spending, tax cuts and actions to reduce future budget deficits.
"What we are going to do with this is be very disciplined about it," he said of his plans for the surplus, the highest in the city's history.
The Mayor's announcement of the surplus in his $34 billion budget immediately drew attacks from the Democratic mayoral candidates, who contended that he had engaged in a cynical strategy of salting away money that he was now channeling toward politically popular programs and tax reductions. The candidates said no amount of new spending could wipe away the impact of the budget cuts that had been made by Mr. Giuliani earlier in his term.
And even as the city's current fiscal picture has brightened, the outlook for the next few years is more discouraging. City Hall anticipates a deficit of $1.4 billion in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The surplus in the current fiscal year will help reduce that deficit, but city budget officials predict that the gap will still be more than $1 billion in the coming fiscal year because the Mayor plans to use some of the $800 million surplus for spending and to replace revenue lost to tax cuts.
Administration officials said, therefore, that in the budget that Mr. Giuliani is to announce next week, he will order at least $750 million in cuts at city agencies to try to close the impending deficit.
For now, though, the unexpected surge in revenues is allowing the Mayor to direct extra money to new programs and proposed tax cuts -- initiatives that he often announces with fanfare at campaign-style events. He has, for example, been barnstorming from school to school in recent months to promote his new reading initiatives, which he is financing in part from some of the extra revenues.
And this week, he has been publicizing plans to eliminate the fare for passengers on the Staten Island ferry and to stop requiring riders to pay an additional fare to transfer between buses and subways. The city is coordinating both initiatives with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The new revenue, in other words, is providing the Mayor with a respite from the gloomy days earlier in his term when his budgets made history not because of their surpluses but because they had some of the steepest cuts in programs in decades.
The size of the surplus for the current fiscal year has more than doubled since January, when the Mayor projected that it would be $391 million. By law, the Mayor presents his preliminary budget in January, which he revises before issuing his executive, or final, budget in May. The executive budget then requires approval by the City Council.
The surplus for the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, is the largest in the city's history in dollar terms, officials said, and among the largest when measured as a percentage of city spending.
The size of a budget surplus is sometimes related to growth in the economy, but it can also be manipulated. Officials can deliberately underestimate their projections of tax revenues when they are shaping the city budget early in the year, so that the actual amount of money that comes in will seem larger than expected. Hence -- a surplus.
That practice is not uncommon in mayoral election years, according to budget experts. But Giuliani administration officials denied indulging in such maneuvering, saying the additional revenues had genuinely surprised them. City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat who has often clashed with the Mayor, said yesterday that he agreed with the administration.
"No one predicted the boom on Wall Street," Mr. Hevesi said. "There is no evidence that the Mayor was lowballing last year's numbers in order to create a political boon with the numbers this year."
The Democratic mayoral candidates were skeptical, saying hefty cuts in previous years helped free up the new money.
"This election-year surplus is generated at the expense and on the backs of working New Yorkers," said Clint Roswell, a spokesman for Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President who is running for mayor. "It's very clear that this was a four-year political calculation."
Responding to the announcement of the surplus, the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said he supported the Mayor's plan for more education spending, and he championed the Council's proposals for tax cuts, which are in part intended to help small businesses in several emerging industries, including high technology. "The challenge we face is how to invest these resources to best prepare the city for continued economic growth," he said.
When the Mayor announced in January that the city would have a surplus of $391 million -- an estimate that has now jumped to the $800 million -- some independent budget eperts complained that he was not devoting enough of that money to deal with the city's long-term budget problems.
They said he was planning to spend too much of the surplus on new programs and to make up for lost reveneus from tax cuts.
Asked about the budget experts' assertions, the Mayor said, "They will criticize it, and for the good of the people of the city, I will ignore it, because if I paid attention to it, we wouldn't be in such good shape."

HEADLINE: Debt Relief for Model Countries

 BODY:
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund recently agreed for the first time to write off some loans to one of its borrowers, Uganda. Uganda is special because of a decadelong policy of pro-growth economic reform. But the importance of the decision goes well beyond a single African country. It means that the bank and the fund have at last put into effect a policy to reward poor, highly indebted countries that are serious about reforming their economies.
Impoverished, indebted countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, cannot escape poverty under the weight of their external debt payments. Oxfam International, an advocacy group that lobbies hard for debt relief, estimates that 20 percent of government revenues in these countries goes to debt payments. Mozambique -- where 25 percent of children die before the age of 5 from infectious diseases -- spends twice as much paying off its debt as it does on health and education. Ethiopia spends four times more on debt payments than it does on health care. 
 Unconditional debt relief, which would reward irresponsible economic policies, is not the answer. The United States and some of its allies pushed for debt relief for countries that undertook pro-market reform, including prudent budget, monetary and trade policies. Last fall the bank and the fund agreed. They promised to write off enough of their own loans to eligible countries so that debt payments would be brought down to affordable levels. The initiative assumed that creditor governments would write off about 80 percent of their loans to such countries. But negotiations stalled over instituting the plan.
The deal announced last week broke the logjam. The bank and the fund rewarded Uganda for its exemplary track record by reducing its official debt to near the lowest level -- about twice the value of its exports -- allowed under last year's initiative. Uganda will be required to wait only one year for the debt write-off. Oxfam criticizes even this short wait because Uganda will suffer a needless additional financial drain. The bank agreed to provide Uganda additional money over the next 12 months to ease the pain, but the fund could also chip in to prevent Ugandans from suffering unnecessarily.
The Uganda deal should encourage other poor, highly indebted countries. The initiative anticipates, for example, helping countries that have large budget deficits, so that they would not be forced to impose crippling tax hikes to qualify for debt relief. The Uganda agreement also recognized in principle that countries forced to wait for debt relief will need additional help in the interim. Finally, the bank and the fund promised to move quickly on other eligible countries -- probably Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Guyana, Mozambique and, eventually, up to a dozen others.
Oxfam worries that the World Bank and the monetary fund will impose excessively harsh waiting periods on other debtor countries and provide insufficient interim relief. These are valid concerns, which the bank and the fund can ease by swiftly moving on to other eligible countries and providing packages at least comparable to Uganda's.

HEADLINE: An Economy Confounding The Experts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The stunning 5.6 percent annual rate of growth in the first quarter surpassed even the most optimistic forecasts and confounded assumptions of a few months ago that the economy would slow in the new year.
The gain, which translated into an increase of $96.1 billion in gross domestic product during the quarter alone -- an advance roughly equal to the total output of the Norwegian economy in an entire year -- reflected heavy spending by consumers and businesses alike, partly as a result of warmer-than-usual weather. 
 The gain brings the economy's inflation-adjusted output to an annual rate of $7.09 trillion.
"Consumers have jobs, incomes and confidence," Everett M. Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce, exulted in an effort to explain the increase.
Although the Clinton Administration claimed credit for the robust growth, and continued modest inflation, it acknowledged it had been caught off guard by the new figures.
"Although we had known that retail sales were strong, we were still surprised to see consumption grow at nearly twice its normal pace," said Janet L. Yellen, chief economic adviser to the President.
After initial concerns that the booming economy could fuel inflation and higher interest rates, the securities markets decided yesterday that the report was not particularly worrisome, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose above the 7,000 mark to its highest close in more than a month.
Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, explained investors' reaction by saying, "The overall bet the markets are making is that this economy will slow to sustainable rates before we do serious damage to the inflation outlook."
Indeed, some early signs of April performance suggest that the economy has now begun to slow. That process may well be spurred by the huge buildup of inventories that accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the first-quarter growth. The size of such inventories implies that production cutbacks lie ahead when consumer demand slackens, as it must, economists said.
The consumer spending binge seemed driven mainly by a 6.4 percent rate of increase in disposable personal income. Shoppers did not need to dip into savings: the savings rate was unchanged, at 5.1 percent.
Analysts said unusually good weather had contributed in some measure to the strong first-quarter growth, in effect inspiring activity that otherwise would not have occurred until spring. Business investment contributed strongly to the growth, rising at an 11.9 percent annual pace, which more than doubled that of the final 1996 period.
Foreign trade, however, was a significant drag on the economy: Americans took advantage of the strong dollar to buy huge amounts of imported goods that otherwise might have been produced here, while the nation's exporters found foreign buyers somewhat less receptive. Trade drag approximately offset the extra growth from inventories.
Today's report, by the Commerce Department, suggested that inflation remained well in check. The price index for gross domestic purchases -- what United States residents pay -- rose at an annual pace of only 2.2 percent in the first quarter, from 2.6 percent at the end of last year.
Analysts were divided about the implications for the Federal Reserve, which in March raised short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point. The dominant view seemed to be that one more tightening of monetary policy was likely, probably on May 20, at the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee.
The Government's report on the April job market, to be issued on Friday, will be crucial to that decision, the analysts said.

HEADLINE: VIGOROUS ECONOMY EXPECTED TO EASE DEFICIT IN BUDGET

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The economy grew at its fastest pace in more than nine years during the first quarter, the Government said today, and Administration officials predicted that the spectacular surge would help drive down this year's Federal budget deficit to about $75 billion, its lowest level in more than 20 years.
The good news on this year's deficit came as the White House and Republicans sought to work out the final details of a bipartisan plan to balance the budget by 2002, and is likely to make it easier for negotiators to bridge their remaining differences. After negotiations broke up late tonight, officials said that a deal could be reached as early as Thursday but warned that there were no guarantees because enough divisive issues were still on the table. Faced with considerable unhappiness within their own ranks about the emerging compromise, leaders of both parties mapped strategies for selling any deal to their members. 
 Yet despite such progress, achieved in a series of meetings between negotiators late Tuesday and through today, the prospects for winning Congressional approval were complicated by a bitter dispute between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. They were fighting over legislation that would provide $5.5 billion in emergency disaster relief to residents of 23 states, including those who lost their homes and businesses to floods in North Dakota and Minnesota in the last few weeks. [Page A15.]
The budget negotiations centered on how much freedom Republicans would have to dictate what kinds of tax cuts any budget would include, with Democrats insisting that the Republicans not be free to enact tax reductions that would primarily benefit the wealthy. There were also continuing discussions about how much the Clinton Administration was willing to give up in spending on domestic programs.
With the outlines of a deal becoming clearer, opposition among liberal Democrats appeared to be growing, with members of both parties estimating that as many as two-thirds of the 207 House Democrats had deep reservations. Republicans also remained concerned about keeping their conservative wing from opposing any deal. "We've made good progress over the last couple of days and we made more today," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said tonight. "Everyone is working furiously, but we're not there yet."
In the midst of the partisan maneuvering, today's figures on first-quarter economic growth and on the size of this year's deficit were good news for both sides. The Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent during the first three months of the year, its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 1987 and far above the expectations of economists. [Page A15.]
Despite some concern that the economy might be growing at a rate that would ignite inflation, stock and bond prices both rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 7008.99, up 46.96 for the day. Analysts said the strength in both the stock and bond markets came in part from hope among investors that a budget deal was near.
The new deficit estimate, calculated by the Treasury Department after tallying April's tax receipts, is far lower than even the most optimistic projections of recent months. It puts the deficit at its lowest dollar level since 1980 and at its lowest point relative to the size of the economy since 1974. It is the clearest evidence yet of how far the nation has come in shoring up its fiscal condition even without a bipartisan agreement to balance the budget.
White House officials declined to comment on the new estimate, which began circulating among Government officials today. But they said they expected the deficit to be substantially lower than they had previously projected, for the fifth year in a row.
If the Treasury's estimate holds up, the deficit for the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30 would be less than 1 percent of the nation's total economic output. The deficit last year was 1.4 percent of economic output. It has not been below 1 percent since 1974, when it was 0.4 percent.
A lower deficit this year would very likely lead to smaller-than-expected deficits in coming years, making the size of the problem facing the budget negotiators somewhat more manageable. In its last official forecast, in January, the Congressional Budget Office predicted a $124 billion deficit for this year, rising to $188 billion in 2002. In February, the Administration projected a $125 billion deficit this year. Last year's deficit was $107 billion, the lowest since 1981.
The lower-than-expected deficit this year would also make it easier for the negotiators to compromise on the economic assumptions they use in predicting future deficits. Over the five-year period covered by the negotiations, the Administration's assumptions are slightly more optimistic than those from the Congressional Budget Office, and a willingness by the Republicans to adopt the White House's figures would go a long way toward closing the gap between the two sides.
Budget analysts said the deficit was falling because of a surprising surge in tax revenues, generated partly by the unexpectedly strong growth of the economy.
So far this year, tax revenues are about $50 billion higher than the Administration had expected. There was a similar unexpected surge last year. Although analysts are not certain of the reason for the shift, they suspect that the economic numbers are being driven by increased taxable earnings among small businesses and a growth in the amount of compensation given to workers in forms that are not subject to regular withholding, including bonuses and stock options.
Officials involved in the budget talks said the parties were $50 billion to $100 billion apart today in eliminating the deficit from a budget expected to total around $2 trillion in 2002.
But the continuing disputes had as much to do with ideology and politics as with numerical differences. After hearing from Administration officials over the last several days that a deal would give them victories in areas like providing health coverage to more uninsured children and restoring welfare benefits to legal immigrants, some Congressional Democrats contended that they could win on those issues without a budget deal -- and do so without giving the Republicans big victories on issues like tax cuts and reducing the growth of Medicare spending.
Democrats were also insisting that any deal include explicit provisions about how any tax cut would be divided. Negotiators have generally agreed on a net tax cut of around $100 billion over five years. Key Republicans like Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, have said the $100 billion figure would be adequate to finance cuts in the capital gains and estate taxes. But they are insisting that the budget deal give them freedom to write this year's tax bills as they see fit.
Democrats want the budget deal to limit any tax cut on capital gains so that it largely benefits homeowners, small-business owners and farmers. Liberal Democrats have long argued that a broad-based capital gains tax cut is a giveaway to the wealthy, who own most of the nation's assets.
The budget deal under discussion would provide around $150 billion for tax cuts over the next five years, offset by as much as $50 billion raised by closing loopholes and extending existing taxes that would otherwise expire. The growth of Medicare spending would be cut by $105 billion to $125 billion. Spending on domestic programs would be reduced by a compromise figure between the $46 billion President Clinton proposed in his budget plan earlier this year and the $118 billion in cuts Republicans have been seeking.
The two sides would also incorporate more optimistic economic assumptions into the plan than Republicans had been willing to accept.

HEADLINE: From the Battery to the Bronx, New York Seeks Corporate Sponsors

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
In an ambitious bid to turn New York City into a brand name, the Giuliani administration has chosen a leading marketing agency to help the city get corporate sponsors for things like playgrounds, snack bars, litter baskets and even police patrol cars, officials said yesterday.
City officials have also asked representatives of Lincoln Center, the American Museum of Natural History, Broadway and other private cultural institutions to consider joining them in seeking sponsorships, which industry experts say could raise tens of millions a year from companies willing to pay to be an "official" product or service of New York City or one of its institutions. 
 "The city of New York in and of itself is an enormously valuable trademark -- maybe one of the most valuable in the world," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday. "The idea of being able to derive revenues from that is, I think, a very creative one and a very good one. Other cities have done it and they have derived substantial revenues for it, and they are not nearly as well known as the city."
Under the plans, a company like Coca-Cola might pay to be the exclusive drink sold at all city-run concession stands, purchase signs on trash cans or underwrite an annual concert in Central Park. An automaker like Ford might pay to call its Crown Victoria model the official patrol car of the New York Police Department.
Other cities have made small forays into an area of marketing tied largely to the sports world. Los Angeles County's beaches have an official suntan lotion and an official bottled water. Buffalo has an official health-maintenance organization and an official paint. And state-run colleges and universities have moved heavily into sponsorships, typically selling exclusive rights to provide drinks on campus to Coke or Pepsi-Cola, or letting Nike or Reebok buy the rights to provide all apparel for athletic teams. But no municipal effort has approached what is contemplated in New York, according to Lesa Ukman, editor of the IEG Sponsorship Report, a trade newsletter. Managed effectively, she said, New York's sponsorship program could approach the fund-raising potential of the Olympic Games, which charges major corporations up to $40 million over four years for the right to use the five-ringed Olympic logo.
City officials, confirming a report of the plan in yesterday's New York Post, said the city wanted only large deals, trying to get at least $1 million from each sponsoring company.
"It's very important that at the end of this process, we'll have a very valuable asset for the city in terms of revenue, of economic development, and for promotional purposes," said David Klasfeld, chief of staff in the Mayor's office of economic development and planning.
A five-year contract being negotiated with the International Management Group, which represents sports stars and other celebrities, would cover at least the Departments of Parks and Recreation, Transportation, Sanitation and General Services, which buys vehicles and other equipment for city agencies. Other agencies like the Board of Education could also sign on, a city official involved in the talks said.
Critics called the city's plan commercialism run amok. "Democratic institutions like cities should be off limits for private corporate sponsorships," said Robert Weissman, a lawyer at Ralph Nader's Center for the Study of Responsive Law. "They shouldn't be auctioned off to the highest commercial bidder. Cities, and what they stand for, are supposed to represent the governed, not just those who can pay to earn city endorsements."
But administration officials said they were sensitive to such criticism. Sponsors will not be offered the right to print the seal of the city on their products; ads in public places will be kept to a minimum, and renaming city streets or buildings for corporate sponsors is out of the question, officials said.
"We're never going to change Central Park to 'Budweiser Park,' " an aide to the Mayor said.

HEADLINE: A Shift to Rigorous Tradition Gains Influence in Judaism

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
To draw a sellout crowd to Madison Square Garden, not for sports or rock music, but to celebrate the reading of a religious text, is no mean feat.
Yet on Sept. 28, one Orthodox Jewish organization says it will do just that by sponsoring a gathering for men who have completed the study of the entire Talmud, the Jewish civil and religious law, by reading a page a day for 2,711 consecutive days, or nearly seven and a half years. The organization, Agudath Israel of America, says it expects 70,000 people to buy tickets, enough to fill the arena and other sites nationwide, to be linked by satellite broadcast. 
 By its scale alone, the event points to a trend within Orthodox Judaism, often discussed among its leaders: the increasing visibility and influence of organizations like Agudath Israel, which has a rigorously traditional approach to the religion, at the expense of a once-dominant moderate wing. This shift within the smallest of Judaism's three major branches threatens to strain its relations with the other two, the Reform and Conservative movements, and to highlight the religious divisions among Jews.
"Within Orthodoxy, there's a sense of being pulled to the right," said Samuel C. Heilman, professor of Jewish studies and sociology at City University of New York.
In a larger sense, the rise in self-confidence and assertiveness on the Orthodox right reflects developments in other faiths, like Christianity and Islam. As many people worry over a steep moral decline in society, the most conservative religious movements, building barriers between themselves and the broader cultures, have grown in influence.
In addition, with the erosion of the old American ideal of the "melting pot," it is far easier for people to assert a distinctive cultural or religious identity in dress and behavior.
The Orthodox, who strictly observe Jewish law, are about 7 percent of an estimated 5.5 million American Jews, according to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey. Forty-two percent of Jewish adults identified with the liberal Reform movement and 38 percent with the Conservative movement, which seeks a middle ground. Most of the rest claimed no affiliation.
The Orthodox are a diverse group, from self-contained, Hasidic sects to people who balance religious observance with careers on Wall Street or in Washington. Still, leaders often speak of two camps, the "modern Orthodox," or "centrists," and the right wing, or ultra-Orthodox. Sociologists say the ultra-Orthodox group is smaller, but it is growing.
The two groups part company over divisive issues like these: how much value to place on secular education; how closely to cooperate with non-Orthodox Jews, and what religious role to give women.
Citing a need for Jewish unity, Orthodox moderates have often found ways to work with their non-Orthodox counterparts. But the Orthodox right has tried to avoid seeming to support forms of Judaism they believe violate religious law.
For decades, modern Orthodoxy was dominant, inspired by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who taught at Yeshiva University in New York and contended that one could be devoutly observant while holding a worldly outlook. But the modern Orthodox position has eroded, hastened by the growth of Orthodox religious schools, or yeshivas, many built and run by the right wing. Many modern Orthodox young people have become doctors, lawyers and other professionals, Professor Heilman said. "Who's left to teach in the day schools? The right-wing community."
Rabbi Moshe Sherer, the president of Agudath Israel, agreed that most yeshivas were "directed by the so-called right wing." That means that modern Orthodox children sent to religious schools have teachers with far more traditional views.
"These parents wake up one day and find their sons are in the right wing," Rabbi Sherer said. "The sons swing the parents over to this world."
"Years ago, we were written off," he added.
When he joined the group in the 1940's, he said, friends saw "no future in that type of Orthodoxy." But, he said, "it's a growth stock today."
"In the spiritual world," he added, "I find the rich are getting richer.
As the ground within Orthodoxy shifts, rabbis in its modern wing speak of colleagues "looking over their right shoulder," to avoid offending more traditional Jews..
In January, an Orthodox rabbinic board in Queens ruled that women's prayer groups violated Jewish tradition. And in March, the small Union of Orthodox Rabbis declared that the Reform and Conservative movements were "not Judaism." The statement came as Israeli Orthodox political parties pushed a law barring government recognition of conversions to Judaism conducted by non-Orthodox rabbis in Israel.
The two largest Orthodox groups, the Rabbinical Council of America and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, said in newspaper advertisements that the statement offended the "Orthodoxy of inclusion."
The Union of Orthodox Rabbis fired back with advertisements that quoted the biblical verse Joshua 5:13, in which an angel asks Joshua, "Are you on our side or are you on the side of the adversary?"
Rabbi Irving Greenberg, president of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership, and an outspoken figure on the Orthodox liberal edge, said the Orthodox community was "polarizing" -- the right was growing by drawing followers from an increasingly muted center.
Like other conservative movements, the Orthodox right wing has benefited from an antipathy to popular culture. In a speech in December, reprinted in The Jewish Sentinel, Professor William B. Helmreich said the right had the advantage of, among other things, charismatic leaders, a higher birthrate, better political organization and the unease Orthodox Jews felt about "moral laxness in society."
"People need to find new restrictions to prove how religious they are," said Professor Helmreich, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of City University.
The restrictions are more obvious today than 30 years ago. For the ultra-Orthodox, for example, television is off limits.
Sociologists say that as the standards for Orthodox living are raised higher, the less observant fall away, perhaps joining non-Orthodox branches of Judaism, while the most committed remain, further reinforcing the right's standing.
Traditionalists, too, have benefited from the rise of pride in ethnicity over the past three decades.
Rabbi Avi Shafran, a former yeshiva teacher and Agudath Israel's spokesman, said that as an adolescent in the 1960's, he felt self-conscious wearing tzitzit, the fringes that, in the Book of Numbers 15:38, God told the Israelites to attach to "the corners of their garments."
But after he encountered a black man wearing a dashiki, a tunic modeled on African tribal garments, he decided, he said, that cultural distinctions could be a source of pride.
"I made sure people could see my yarmulke," he said, adding, "We got a lot of security out of the black liberation movement of the 1960's."
The divisions within Orthodoxy have lately come under scrutiny in Jewish publications. Last June, Moment magazine described the rise of a "more fundamentalist" leadership among the Orthodox and even reported that some modern Orthodox families in Baltimore bused their children out of town to avoid ultra-Orthodox day schools where preschoolers were separated by sex.
Still, some Orthodox leaders say the talk of greater power on the right is overstated.
"What we're seeing," said Rabbi Rafael Grossman, the Rabbinical Council's president, "is not a more influential right, but a more vocal right."
Rabbi Grossman added that he believed the modern Orthodox wing was growing, too. Within the last decade, he said, 54 schools have been founded within the modern Orthodox fold.
Rabbi Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva University in New York, said he believed tensions within Orthodoxy were lessening. He cited fewer right-wing criticisms of his institution, long regarded as a bulwark of modern Orthodoxy.
"A few years ago," Rabbi Lamm said, "they would savage us with a truculence that seemed to exceed itself each time."
People on both sides of the debate point to the Orthodox birthrate to suggest that, whichever movement becomes dominant, Orthodox Judaism will become far more important in America. The National Jewish Population Study found that Orthodox families tend to be larger, with an average of 2.4 children, compared with 1.9 among the non-Orthodox.
"That's a pretty significant difference," Egon Mayer, professor of sociology at the City University of New York, said, adding, "1.9 is below replacement level."
But Professor Mayer cautioned against relying too heavily on those statistics, because people can change their minds about religion. He pointed to the survey's finding that fewer than one-third of Jews who said they were raised Orthodox still considered themselves to be that.
Some say they expect economic pressures to push the right wing into the modernist camp. Under this scenario, ultra-Orthodox communities, unable to survive on yeshiva teachers' earnings, will persuade more men to seek careers in secular professions, creating a class disinclined to cultural separatism.
Rabbi Sherer disagreed, saying, "In Agudath Israel, we have hundreds of attorneys, hundreds of doctors, hundreds of professors."
Professional success was "not a goal in itself," he added, saying that religious study "is the beginning and end of our lives."

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 1 about differences among Orthodox Jews identified the speaker in a verse from the Bible, Joshua 5:13 incorrectly. The question, "Are you on our side, or are you on the side of the adversary?" was spoken by Joshua to an angel, not by an angel to Joshua.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Broadly Lower After a Surge vs. Yen Fizzles

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly yesterday after an overseas rally against the Japanese yen fizzled and United States manufacturing data cast doubt over an expected increase in interest rates.
The dollar rallied as high as 127.47 yen in Tokyo -- its highest since August 1992 -- before heavy selling by Japanese exporters and life insurers and unconfirmed rumors of looming Bank of Japan intervention brought the rally to a halt. 
 "A lot of the short-term and interbank traders were expecting a decent run-up once we broke above 127.15-30 yen and the fact of the matter is it didn't go much higher and the Japanese were heavy sellers," said David Gilmore, a partner at the market consulting firm Foreign Exchange Analytics. "That has taken the wind out of the dollar's sails."
Trading was thin yesterday, with many European markets closed for May Day. In New York, the dollar settled at 126.51 yen, down from 127.06 yen on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.7217 marks from 1.7303.
Dragging the dollar down further in New York trading was the release of the April index of the National Association of Purchasing Management, which fell to 54.2 from 55. The data suggested a slight slowdown in manufacturing output and reinforced the notion of a strong United States economy devoid of inflation.
"Over the last couple of sessions, we've had numbers come out which suggested that perhaps the inflation component of the U.S. economy is not as high as the market had feared," said Audrey McNiff, a vice president in foreign exchange sales at Goldman, Sachs. "This led the market to believe that the potential for interest rate rises is less than expected."
Expectations that the Federal Reserve would again raise interest rates at a May 20 meeting had fueled the dollar's recent rise.
In other trading, the pound was steady as Britons went to the polls. The pound strengthened slightly to $1.6242, from $1.6237 Wednesday.
Against the Canadian dollar, the dollar fell sharply, hurt by diminished prospects for higher United States rates. The Bank of Canada intervened in the market twice yesterday to cool off the rally in the Canadian dollar. It settled at 72.09 United States cents, up from 71.6 United States cents on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: It's Spring Fever: Art Has a Date With Its Lovers

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
AS the art world prepares for the important spring auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art that begin next week in Manhattan, it is speculating about just how much nerve -- and how many millions -- the serious collectors will muster.
Economic indicators like the stock market and real estate sales point to quite a lot. "When people have money, they're going to spend it," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America. "We're in that moment of the art cycle. People are hungry to buy things of top quality." 
 In addition to the usual offerings -- nice, middle-range Picassos and Monets, Cy Twomblys and de Koonings -- the sales at Sotheby's and Christie's over the next two weeks also include some major masterpieces. They are what may well infect buyers with the kind of old-fashioned auction frenzy that made these sales a popular spectator sport a decade ago. Art experts say there is even serious museum interest in a few of the best works, something that hasn't been seen for several years now.
Of the estimated $400 million worth of art, which can be viewed at the auction houses beginning this weekend, by far the most notable works come from just a few estates. The most important estate is that of John Langeloth Loeb, the Wall Street magnate, and his wife, Frances Lehman Loeb. Their collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, to be auctioned at Christie's on May 12, includes $80 million worth of works by artists like Cezanne, Manet and Toulouse-Lautrec. Proceeds from the sale are to finance the newly organized Frances and John L. Loeb Family Fund, which will support programs in education, health, art and public policy. Christie's has gone all-out in promoting the collection, with a hard-bound catalogue in its own slipcase.
Mr. Loeb, who died in December at 94, and Mrs. Loeb, who was 89 when she died last May, began buying art in the 1950's and 1960's from well-known New York dealers, especially Knoedler & Company.
The collection has three major stars. The first is Cezanne's "Madame Cezanne Seated in a Yellow Chair" (1893-1895), a portrait of the artist's wife in a red dress in a corner of the artist's Paris studio, one in a series of four he did of his wife. The others are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Sao Paolo Museum of Art in Brazil. While Christie's has not officially put an estimate on the painting, experts there expect it to sell for about $25 million. The Loebs bought the painting at Knoedler in 1956 for $125,000.
Another prized Cezanne they acquired at Knoedler is the landscape "View From L'Estaque" (1883-1885), depicting the bay of Marseilles from the village. The Loebs paid $728,000 and gave Knoedler another landscape in exchange for it; the painting is expected to bring $8 million to $10 million.
The third star in the collection features one of the great self-portraits of the 19th century, "Manet With His Palette" (1878). Like an Old Master painting, the work has the artist posed against a rich brown background, with an intense stare and a paintbrush and palette in his hands. Christie's experts estimate the painting may bring $15 million. The Loebs bought the portrait for $176,800 at the celebrated London sale of the collection of the New York investment banker Jakob Goldschmidt at Sotheby's in 1958.
Months before Christie's announced it had won the Loeb collection, the auction house had obtained works from another important collector's estate, that of Jacques Koerfer, a German businessman whose heirs have been selling portions of the holdings -- stunning examples of works by artists like Picasso, Vlaminck and Modigliani -- for three years now. This is the third round of Koerfer property and it, too, comes in a special catalogue, titled "Important Paintings and Sculpture From a European Estate."
The current selection, which is being sold on May 14, includes Picasso's "Torso of a Young Girl With a Pitcher" (1906), a Rose Period portrait of the artist's mistress Fernande Olivier. Christie's estimates it will sell for $5 million to $7 million. Another star piece is Mondrian's "Composition No. III" (1929), an exquisite abstract composition from one of the artist's most desirable periods. Not only is it in excellent condition, but it is also in the artist's own frame. Christie's estimate is $3 million to $4 million.
Of the two auction houses, Christie's has captured most of the plum property. "People like being in good company," said Franck Giraud, who heads Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art. "Sellers don't want to have art that competes, but at the same time, they do like their art to be sold in the company of other important works."
But Sotheby's does have a handful of notable paintings in its Impressionist and modern sale on May 13. Modigliani's "Jeanne Hebuterne Wearing a Hat" (circa 1919) is one of the artist's finest portraits, depicting a woman with an elongated neck and vacant, almond-shaped eyes. It is expected to bring $8 million to $10 million. Another important work at Sotheby's, which is being sold by the heirs of the French dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, is an 1899 Degas, "Dancers." The brightly colored scene is considered to be among the artist's best late pastels, and is expected to fetch $5 million to $7 million.
Also up for sale at Sotheby's are works from Henry Moore's personal art collection, which is being sold by his daughter, Mary Moore. The group includes paintings and drawings by Cezanne, Degas, Millet, Seurat and Corot, as well as many of the artist's own sculptures and drawings, including the 1927 "Mask," an early greenish-gray stone carving expected to sell for $100,000 to $150,000.
Sotheby's is also selling works from the estate of Florence and Richard Weil, St. Louis collectors who had a taste for 20th-century art. One of the best paintings in this group is Picasso's 1927 "Head and Guitar," which is expected to bring $1 million to $1.5 million.
"Three or four years ago, all we would get is estates, but now there are a lot more discretionary sellers," said Alexander Apsis, head of the department of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's.
That is not the case with contemporary art. Experts at Sotheby's and Christie's report that it is still difficult to put together strong sales in this field. Yet along with some pieces that have been for sale all too recently, both houses have managed to cobble together auctions that offer a few very good works.
"I purposely put together a smaller sale that is a little different," said Tobias Meyer, who is Sotheby's head of contemporary art worldwide. The contemporary sale on Tuesday will be the first in New York for Mr. Meyer, who has led Sotheby's department in London for five years. He brings an international sensibility, putting in the auction some works of European taste that would traditionally only be found in London sales.
The first 11 offerings in the auction are primarily from the 1980's and 90's and are being sold by the Boston Children's Heart Foundation. (The collection was formed by Dr. Bernardo Nadal-Ginard, a Boston cardiologist who is now serving a one-year prison sentence for misappropriating money from the nonprofit medical foundation, which conducts research on heart disease in children.) The works are by an avant-garde group of trendy artists like Kiki Smith, Matthew Barney, Robert Gober and Jeff Koons. It is expected to attract a small but passionate group of buyers.
Sotheby's sale also includes works from the estate of William C. Janss, a California real estate developer. One of its stars is Mark Rothko's "No. 19" from 1960, which is expected to sell for $1.8 million to $2.2 million. By far the most important work in Sotheby's contemporary sale is de Kooning's "Untitled," from 1947, which the auction house expects to sell for $2 million to $2.5 million. No one knows how a work by de Kooning, who died in March, will be received at auction. Often, right after an artist dies, so does his market, but not always; in Andy Warhol's case, prices skyrocketed.
Christie's also has an important de Kooning in its sale on Wednesday: "Amityville," a 1971 painting with brilliant scoops of color and wide brush strokes that also carries a $2 million to $2.5 million estimate.
Two other noteworthy paintings at Christie's are examples of early Pop Art. Roy Lichtenstein's "Blang" (1962), one of the artist's war images, carries a $3 million to $4 million estimate. The other, also from 1962, is Wayne Thiebaud's "Bakery Counter," which is among the largest of the artist's early still lifes and shows rows of multicolored pastries. It is estimated at $650,000 to $850,000.
Christie's contemporary sale has one single-owner collection: 22 sculptures belonging to Douglas S. Cramer, a television producer. Among the artists whose works he bought over the years are Joel Shapiro, Ellsworth Kelly and Jim Dine. Some pieces are from his personal collection and others are from a foundation he established last year to support the visual arts. (Proceeds from works sold by the foundation are going to the foundation.)
"I've tried to make this a well-rounded sale," said Neal Melzer, head of Christie's contemporary art department in New York, "to offer collectors everything from Pop Art and New York School to Minimalist and important 1980's works."

HEADLINE: Playing Poker in Zaire: Rebel Leader Holds the Aces

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, May 1

 BODY:
If President Mobutu Sese Seko and the rebel leader Laurent Kabila meet on a South African ship on Friday as scheduled, the encounter will be a first between two men whose fates have been loosely linked for three decades but whose destinies are now streaking in opposite directions.
For Mr. Mobutu, 66, a dictator of almost mythic stature who has been reduced by cancer to a pallid shell, Friday's meeting supposedly offers as dignified a way out as possible at this late date for a man whose army is defeated and whose power is now all but gone. 
 With his health visibly failing by the day and his adversary leaving little room for niceties in a drive for power that is but a few days from its goal, the question most were asking today was whether Mr. Mobutu would leave Zaire on Friday for a final voyage.
The South African President, Nelson Mandela, is to accompany his Zairian counterpart from Pointe-Noire, a Congo coastal city, to the shipboard meeting. But several diplomats and associates of Mr. Mobutu say that once Mr. Mobutu leaves Zaire, whether or not he ever makes it to the rendezvous with Mr. Kabila, a hospital bed somewhere abroad, certain exile and death await him soon afterward.
Mr. Kabila's rebels are reportedly within 150 miles of Kinshasa and are closing in on Mr. Mobutu's palatial residence in the far-northern city of Gbadolite. People close to the President say Mr. Mobutu's Versailles-like palace in Gbadolite has been emptied in recent weeks, with most of its contents flown to Morocco, which suggests that that country may be a final refuge.
Members of Mr. Mobutu's inner circle deny what for them is unthinkable: that the only leader most Zairians have ever known is near death, or is even contemplating giving up power and going into exile.
But asked if his gravely ill father should be attending to his health rather than clinging to vestiges of power, Mr. Mobutu's 27-year-old son, Nzanga, said in an interview today: "Yes, that is the most important thing. And he is concerned."
"The media focus on Mobutu not doing anything for his country, but he has done many things, and his legacy will be the unity of Zaire," Nzanga Mobutu, who is his father's official spokesman, said in what sounded distinctly like a summing up of a life and a career that are ending.
While the struggle to define Mr. Mobutu's legacy gets under way, Mr. Kabila's ascension has created another sort of industry: predicting how this lifelong revolutionary will rule Africa's third largest country, and just as important, how he will fare.
A meeting Tuesday between Mr. Kabila and Bill Richardson, Washington's representative at the United Nations and President Clinton's special envoy here, produced few firm answers, but left the lingering feeling that the 56-year-old revolutionary remains trapped in an obsolete past.
"He was talking a lot about big projects, roads and industries that the state will create," one member of Mr. Richardson's delegation said, using the word Maoist to describe the sketchy program. "Even state agriculture. I just told him that it won't work."
Mr. Kabila's victory in a seven-month war came at the cost of deals cut with neighboring countries, each with grievances against Mr. Mobutu and Zaire. The recent massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees near Kisangani, in eastern Zaire, apparently by Rwandan Tutsi forces that have formed the backbone of Mr. Kabila's army, have already badly tarnished his reputation.
The massacres have raised troubling questions about who is in charge of the rebels' Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo, and whether the movement, a shadowy collection of disparate interests and influences, can remain united once in power.
Rwanda was Mr. Kabila's first sponsor in this war, but was quickly joined by Uganda, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Diplomats say that today it is Angola, which has been making large donations of men, materiel and especially money, that has become the foremost influence on the Alliance.
Besides an abiding hatred of Mr. Mobutu, who destabilized neighbors throughout his career, each country has its own interests in Zaire, from vengeance against the Hutu (in the case of Rwanda), to investment in the copper industry (for Zambia), to military and economic isolation of Unita in Angola, a rebel movement that has recently and uneasily joined the Government.
Add to this the inexperience of Mr. Kabila's leadership team, many of whom have only recently returned from years of exile, and a political class in Kinshasa that is unlikely to swallow Mr. Kabila's brand of one-party leadership for long, and diplomats wonder if the rebel movement can long last in power.
Mr. Kabila's jovial and serene face offers no indication that he is bracing for a tough time ahead, but his associates told diplomats this week that they are already considering moving Zaire's capital away from Kinshasa in order to insulate their leader from unrest in a traditionally contentious capital.
"You look at the competition for influence on Kabila by his neighbors and then think about the problems that await him in Kinshasa, and you can't escape the feeling that this guy is riding a tiger," said one member of Mr. Richardson's delegation. "And it could be a long time before Zaire is out of the woods."

HEADLINE: Man Blows His Hand Off in Booby-Trapped Apartment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
A Bronx man who booby-trapped his apartment with homemade bombs accidentally blew his left hand off yesterday morning, the police said, prompting the evacuation of dozens of families from the area while the remaining explosives were dismantled.
The man, John Saperstein, 36, an unemployed construction worker, set off one of the bombs in his apartment at 1054 Longfellow Avenue in East Tremont shortly before 8 A.M., the police said. Neither the woman Mr. Saperstein lived with nor their 18-month-old daughter was hurt. 
 At Lincoln Hospital, where he was taken for surgery, Mr. Saperstein told the police there were two more bombs in the apartment, officers said.
But the police found four more explosive devices in the apartment, which was cluttered and squalid, said Assistant Chief John W. Scanlon, the commanding officer of Patrol Borough Bronx. One device was rigged with translucent fishing wire and was primed to explode when the wire was tripped; another was hidden in a flashlight; a third was in a small container the size of a shotgun shell, and a fourth was hidden in a box of baby wipes, he said.
Just what Mr. Saperstein -- who has a criminal record dating back to 1983 for weapons possession, disorderly conduct and drug possession -- was doing with all the explosives puzzled investigators. "There's no indication he was involved in any group," said a police investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "There were no rantings or anarchist writings of any kind."
But a man who was visiting the neighborhood said that in the one conversation he had with Mr. Saperstein, Mr. Saperstein mentioned various right-wing organizations. "He started mentioning the Patriots of America and the militia and I said, 'Oh, I've got to go,' " said David Lao, 37, who was visiting from Fort Reilly, Kan.
Mr. Lao, a civilian employee on a military base, said that Mr. Saperstein had quizzed him about plastic explosives."He started talking about C-4 and Semtex and automatic weapons," he recalled. "I was like, 'Hey man, back off.' "
Neighbors were startled by the noise of the blast, and by the news that one of their neighbors had apparently been concocting explosives on their tree-lined block of row houses just off the Bruckner Expressway.
"At first I thought maybe a car had backfired," said Fabian Hamlet, 36, who lives next door. "Then I saw fire trucks going by and I thought I'd be nosy, so I went outside. That's when I heard it had been a bomb, so I got everyone out of my house."
Other neighbors, including several children, said that Mr. Saperstein sold them fireworks and weapons. "Last year he sold me about $30 worth of ashcans and M-80's," said Edward Oserio, 24. "He also sold kids lipstick knives, knives disguised as lipstick tubes, and knives inside pens."
A 14-year-old boy displayed a razor blade in a duct-tape case. "John gave me this," said the boy, who gave his name only as Roger.
As special container trucks waited to cart the explosives off to the Police Department's firing range at Rodmans Neck, neighbors, some still in their pajamas, waited to be allowed back into their homes. The Red Cross gave dinner to about 20 families and set up a shelter at nearby Public School 75.
The authorities said that Mr. Saperstein may have learned how to make incendiary devices while working for his family's construction company in New Jersey. Tucked in among the garbage, baby food jars and cans of cat food that littered his apartment, they found bullets, hypodermic needles and several books on explosives, including "The Anarchist Cookbook," they said.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: THE CUTS;
Negotiators Move to Rein In Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The budget deal shaping up on Capitol Hill would significantly restrain the growth of spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, further reducing the Federal deficit. But lobbyists for the elderly and governors of both parties said today that they found parts of the agreement unacceptable.
Under the agreement, as outlined today by negotiators of both parties, millions of retirees would face higher Medicare premiums and would receive somewhat smaller Social Security checks in future years than they would get under current law. 
 In addition, Federal spending on health benefits for poor people under Medicaid would probably be capped for the first time, a radical change in a program that has been open-ended since its creation in 1965.
The negotiators also said they had accepted President Clinton's proposal to shore up Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund by shifting much of the cost of home health care to another account, which pays doctors' bills. But contrary to Mr. Clinton's suggestion, Republicans insisted that home health costs be financed by higher premiums, and they have apparently prevailed.
Congressional experts estimate that this change would eventually add $8.70 to the monthly Medicare premium, which is now $43.80 and is already expected to rise to $51.50 by 2002 under current law. Elderly people with incomes below a certain level, perhaps $30,000 a year, would not have to pay the extra premium for home health care.
Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said he could not vote for the budget blueprint in its current form. But he offered to help the Republicans write their proposal to increase Medicare premiums.
"We'll win back the House if they do it," Mr. Stark said. In last year's election campaign, Democrats battered Republicans for proposing Medicare cutbacks, and Republicans acknowledge that the attacks hurt them.
Congressional Republicans and Clinton Administration officials said they had tentatively agreed to reduce projected Medicare spending by $115 billion, or 8.5 percent, over the next five years, splitting the difference between them. Mr. Clinton had originally proposed to cut Medicare spending by $100 billion in that period, but later increased his offer to $105 billion. The Republicans had sought savings of $125 billion.
The proposed changes would keep Medicare's hospital trust fund solvent until 2008 but would not address the huge fiscal problems that will face the entire program after baby boomers start to retire in 2011.
The emerging budget agreement would also shave perhaps four-tenths of one percentage point from the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security and other benefits. Supporters of this proposal said it would partly correct the overstatement of inflation that many economists perceive in the Consumer Price Index.
Dan J. Schulder, a lobbyist for the National Council of Senior Citizens, said the developing budget agreement was "a bad deal for seniors."
John C. Rother, chief lobbyist at the American Association of Retired Persons, which has more than 33 million members, said:
"The authors of this agreement are cutting Medicaid. They're raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries. They're cutting Social Security cost-of-living adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. Those changes all affect low-income people.
"At the same time, they're cutting taxes on estates and on capital gains to benefit the better-off. This is income redistribution in reverse. It makes us more unequal as a society."
The budget negotiators have agreed to cut projected spending on Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for low-income people, by $22 billion to $24 billion, or 4 percent, over the next five years.
The negotiators assume that much of the savings will be achieved by setting firm limits on Federal spending for each Medicaid beneficiary -- a "per capita cap," like the one Mr. Clinton proposed in February.
The National Governors' Association joined advocates for the elderly and for children in denouncing this proposal today. They said the proposal undercut efforts to expand health insurance coverage of children.
A letter to Mr. Clinton signed by 41 governors says, "We adamantly oppose a cap on Federal Medicaid spending in any form."
As for Medicare, budget negotiators said they were determined to curb its spending on home health services, which has exploded in recent years, rising to $16.7 billion in 1996 from $3.3 billion in 1990. Medicare patients treasure the benefit because it allows them to receive care in their own homes, rather than in a hospital, a doctor's office or a nursing home.
Home health agencies are now paid a separate amount for each visit, based on their costs, and there is no limit on the number of visits. Under the plan being devised in Congress, those agencies would receive a fixed amount of money for all the visits to a patient in a given period, perhaps four months. If they provided the services for less than that amount, they could keep some of the savings.

HEADLINE: Problems Aside, Washington Seeks to Be Host of Olympics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
In the same week that District of Columbia officials said 11 public schools would be closed and the widow of a slain city policeman pleaded for the death penalty for police killers, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. announced today that Washington would seek to be host for the 2008 Summer Olympics.
"We deserve it," Mayor Barry said. "This is the place to be." 
 Surrounded by members of the Greater Washington Exploratory Committee at a news conference, Mr. Barry said the city had officially entered the bidding by sending a $100,000 check to the United States Olympic Committee, which will select the American candidates. Washington will now compete with several other cities, including Baltimore, Cincinnati, Houston, New York, San Francisco and Seattle, that want to be the site of the first American summer games after the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
The 2000 Summer Olympics have been awarded to Sydney, Australia; the 2004 Summer Olympics will be awarded in early September, and no American city is bidding.
Unlike its competitors for the 2008 honor, Washington is a city inundated with serious problems despite the presence of the Federal Government. Years of fiscal mismanagement at the local level led Congress to create a financial control board, which has been the real seat of power in the city government since 1995. And the board has slowly begun to improve the school system, police department and other city agencies.
Enormous work remains, however, and the amount of it is only underscored with every new crisis.
In recent months, nothing has rocked the city more than the killings of three metropolitan police officers, and the control board's support of efforts to save money in the school system by closing up to 18 schools.
Last Saturday night, as an off-duty city police officer, Robert L. Johnson Jr., sat in his car with his partner, two men approached, the police said, and one shot both officers, killing Officer Johnson and wounding the other, Sgt. Paul Shelton. The police have arrested Maurice A. Douglas, 22, charging him with first-degree murder, and are still looking for his 17-year-old accomplice, whom they have identified as Dominic Gibson.
On Wednesday, Tracie Gibson, whose husband, Officer Brian T. Gibson, was fatally shot as he sat in his car at a traffic light in February, appeared before a Senate subcommittee and, referring to her husband's killer, said: "This person gave my husband the death penalty. I don't think he deserves anything less."
On Monday a board of trustees appointed to run the public schools ended weeks of deliberations and announced that 11 schools would be closed across the city and that two others would be razed and rebuilt. The announcements angered hundreds of parents, who complained about the disruption the changes would cause for their children.
Mr. Barry was asked how a city suffering with problems of such magnitude could win the favor of Olympics officials, who will decide late next year which -- if any -- American city would bid for the 2008 Games. (A spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, Mike Moran, said some committee members preferred waiting four or eight years more before trying to bring another summer games to the United States.)
Mr. Barry sidestepped the question, instructing reporters to recognize the positive aspects of Washington, like a new arena under construction for the city's National Basketball Association and National Hockey League teams.
Besides, the Mayor added, steering thoughts to a hoped-for, problem-free future, "We're talking about the year 2008, and I won't be. . . . Well, I won't say that."
Mr. Barry, 61, has declined to say whether he will run next year for a second consecutive term -- and fifth over all. Because a Washington mayor can serve only two consecutive terms, Mr. Barry could only be mayor in 2008 if he takes a term off.
Mr. Barry sounded every bit the city's First Cheerleader in ticking off the economic benefits that would accrue to Washington with the Olympics, and assuring regional residents that the nation's capital would never play a supporting role to a bid by Baltimore.
He also said that the entry fee was raised by private interests and that all bidding costs -- which could exceed $30 million for the American candidate city, Mr. Moran said -- would be borne by private sponsors.
While many officials and community leaders hailed the effort, others found it insulting, when so many city agencies are struggling.
"The idea that they might spend money for the infrastructure to build all that stuff is unbelievable to me," said Delabian Rice-Thurston, director of Parents United, a group that works for quality education. "It's one of those bizarre things that always seems to happen here. I'm not surprised. But if we get it, it would be infuriating."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rally for 4th Straight Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Government securities market rallied for the fourth straight day yesterday, as a string of reports suggested the economy might be cooling enough to allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates on hold when it meets to set policy on May 20.
Also giving support to bonds was steadfast optimism among some investors that Congressional leaders and the President were close to reaching an agreement to balance the Federal budget. A balanced budget shrinks the deficit, which means the Government would have to sell fewer bonds, making existing securities scarcer and more expensive, with lower yields. 
 The 30-year bond rose yesterday by 16/32, to a price of 96 13/32 to yield 6.91 percent, down from 6.95 percent on Wednesday, and the lowest yield since 6.88 percent on March 12.
In light of this week's market- friendly data, some market participants are not looking for any surprises on the strong side for today's jobs report, and that may have stimulated more buying. The market consensus is for a gain of 200,000 jobs, but analysts believe the key will be the unemployment rate and hourly earnings figures.
The initial unemployment claims for the week ended April 26 rose by 28,000, to 347,000. Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said that 347,000 was the highest reported initial unemployment claims figure since the start of the year, when claims data were distorted by the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
Ms. Schaja said there were no surprises in the figures for March income and consumption. "Personal income rose 0.6 percent, only slightly more than we had expected," she added. "As suggested by last month's employment report, this increase was largely due to a 0.7 percent rise in wages and salaries." January and February income growth was revised downward one-tenth of a percent. Consumption rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March, with strength coming from each of the durables, nondurables and services sectors.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of business activity fell marginally to 54.2 in April from 55 in March, indicating continued strength. Ms. Schaja said, "The details of the report indicate that while the economy remains strong, inflation remains quiescent," she said. A reading over 50 is an indication that manufacturing is expanding.
Moreover, the details of the report indicate that the labor market remains tight. The prices-paid component in the report, a measure of inflation, dropped to 49.6 from 50.9.
In the construction data, also released yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that spending during March slipped only marginally by two-tenths of a percentage point following a sharp gain of 2.1 percentage points in the month before, indicating that construction activity remains robust.
But Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., predicts that construction will not stay hot for a number of reasons, among them, that new- and existing-home sales were off slightly in March and that reported high levels of first-quarter home sales partly reflected accelerated demand by home buyers, who feared mortgage rates would rise; thus those sales borrowed from subsequent demand.
Mr. Harris said that while the Mortgage Bankers Association reported yesterday morning that its index of home purchase mortgage applications rose 3.6 percent in the week ended April 25, the smoother monthly or quarterly averages are less volatile for a better idea of general index trends. The average home purchase index level through the first four weeks of April is 179.8, which is lower than the 191.1 average for the first quarter. "Thus," he said, "the home purchase mortgage applications index is beginning to recede to a level consistent with the recent flattening in construction contracting and our expected second-quarter slowdown in housing."
In when-issued trading late yesterday the three-year note to be auctioned next week was offered at a price to yield 6.41 percent, down 2 basis points from the previous day, and the 10-year note at 6.69 percent, down 3 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

The New Face at No. 10: Anthony Charles Lynton Blair

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 1

 BODY:
When Tony Blair was 11, his father, a lawyer and university lecturer in the northern English city of Durham, suffered a disabling stroke, and the boy thought his world had "fallen apart." By Mr. Blair's account, a man who had been "very ambitious, successful, a go-getter," was stilled and speechless, and the son was uncomprehending.
Mr. Blair told this affecting story to a conference of his Labor Party in Blackpool in October in what was a strikingly confessional moment for a British politician and particularly for one as discreet and guarded as the new 43-year-old Prime Minister of Britain. 
 Some people, aware of the comparisons often made between the telegenic young British leader and President Clinton, dismissed the telling of the tale as "American style," a pejorative in British political commentary.
But the audience was rapt, and they were Mr. Blair's objective. Younger and more middle-class than people who had sat in the delegate seats at any past Labor convention, they were there because of his remarkable makeover of their party. Yet he still worried they might attribute his success to style rather than soul, might think that things came too easily to Tony Blair, might wonder whether he understood that life could be a struggle.
He told of how the family finances suffered and how his mother took three years to teach his father to walk and talk again. And then he came to his point. "I don't pretend to you that I had a deprived childhood," he said. "I didn't, but I learned a sense of values in my childhood."
As deft as he has been in turning the clattering old Labor Party, loser of four straight elections, into a clean-running engine of victory, he is eager for people to believe it runs not on some synthetic concocted in campaign laboratories but on conviction and values.
He is stepping into the leadership of the country after a safety-first campaign aimed at assuring the voters of Middle England that the party has been defanged. He has talked of his admiration of the purposefulness of the major player in British politics of his lifetime, Margaret Thatcher, and suggested that he was heir to her brand of movement politics. But while she prepared a real revolution in 1979, he has so far mixed a recipe for maintenance of the status quo.
All this has left him vulnerable to the judgment that he is packaged goods rather than the real thing. In the last weeks of the campaign the word "passion" got a lot of air time in the Blair campaign.
His early struggle with his father's illness aside, Mr. Blair's life story is not the fable of a born dragon slayer.
Born in Edinburgh on May 6, 1953, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair was educated at Durham Choristers, Fettes College in Edinburgh, known as the Eton of Scotland, and Oxford University, where he studied law.
The discipline over himself and his party that he was to display in later years was evident even then. He confined his rebelliousness to growing his hair long, wearing 1970's fashions and singing in a rock band called Ugly Rumors.
His biographer, John Rentoul, says he was "discreet about sex, abstemious about drugs and earnest about rock and roll." A male acquaintance once said he was the kind of person who you'd suspect might press his jeans.
Before Oxford he spent a year in London, where he drove a van, moved equipment for musical groups, worked in the basement of a department store and slept on the sofas of friends.
"It was one of the best things I ever did," he said in an interview in The Sunday Times Magazine last weekend. "It taught me about how other people lived, the real world, if you like," he said with the guilelessness that some find disarming and others cloying.
After college he became a lawyer in London, nursing a vague interest in public affairs and swapping sentiments about a classless society and reformist politics with friends but more concerned, because of the experience that had befallen his family and by his own admission, in guaranteeing his own personal security.
He joined the Labor Party with less passion for its causes of nationalization and trade union power than uneasiness with its narrow-band membership and core Socialist focus. One of his first acts as a party member was to write a paper urging the party to try to understand the appeal of the liberal Social Democratic Party.
In 1980 he married a fellow lawyer, Cherie Booth, who has gone on to become one of London's best-known attorneys. The couple have three children: Euan, 13; Nicholas, 11, and Kathryn, 9.
Mr. Blair's first attempt at running for office was an unsuccessful by-election in 1982 for a seat considered unwinnable for Labor in Beaconsfield, west of London. A year later he went north to Sedgefield, near Durham, and gained the seat he still holds today.
His posts in Parliament put him in touch with constituencies he would one day try to make the broad base of what he calls the "New Labor" Party -- trade union people whom he tried to ease into recognition of their diminished power, law enforcement officials who acquainted him with the appeal of law and order to crime-ridden neighborhoods and businessmen and financiers in the City of London with whom his years as a lawyer made him comfortable.
He made his way on intelligence, energy, charm and discipline. Politics itself, the dealing and trading and smoky-room wrangling, held less appeal. To this day, he will often put the word "tribal" before the word "politics," an indication of his feeling that it is more divisive than unifying.
Mr. Blair's progress toward becoming the ambitious and focused person who has taken over British public life was clearly gradual.
Geoff Gallop, an Oxford classmate from Australia, didn't spot it in college but remembers encountering a man who had taken on resolve when he saw his old friend in 1992. "Power can fizzle out very quickly if it's not accompanied by a natural authority," he said, "and it was flowing from him."
When Labor lost its fourth straight national election that year, its leader, Neil Kinnock, resigned, replaced by his deputy, John Smith. When Mr. Smith died in 1994 the leading candidate to succeed him was his right-hand man, Gordon Brown, a Scottish economist with a brilliant mind but dour public image.
Mr. Blair let it be known that he thought he stood a better chance of uniting the party behind the mission of winning. In the old Labor Party, it would have been time for a blood-letting. In New Labor the moment called for a civilized settlement, and it took place in a place typifying the dark-suited, mobile-phoned personality of the refashioned party -- the minimalist Granita restaurant in Islington, the neighborhood that is to London what the Upper West Side is to New York.
Mr. Blair was chosen, and, with Mr. Brown as his right-hand man, set out to pick up the pace of reform that had been set in motion by his two predecessors. He wrote nationalization out of the party's constitution, reduced its dependency on trade union money and turned it into the champion of the guy trying to get ahead. His iron-hand rule enriched his reputation for strong leadership, while his ability to state party objectives in broad and non-threatening ways earned him the nickname of "Tony Blur" from enemies but brought tens of thousands of new members into the party.
One of them is his father, Leo, the onetime chairman of the Durham Conservative Association. Last year he left the Conservative Party, and today he cast the first Labor vote of his life.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing and Construction Slow a Bit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity grew at a slower rate in April than the month earlier, although the economy continued to grow for the 72d consecutive month, the National Association of Purchasing Management said today.
In a separate report, the Government said that the pace of construction spending slowed in March as a decline in commercial construction offset an increase in home building and public projects. A third report showed that more American workers applied for state unemployment benefits last week than in the week earlier. 
 The purchasing managers' association said its factory index declined to 54.2 last month from 55 in March. The decline was smaller than expected. Readings of 50 or more mean manufacturing is expanding.
The manufacturing report also showed that the price index, considered by some an indication of the inflation rate, fell to 49.6 in April from 50.9 in March.
Analysts say the outlook for manufacturing may not be as favorable as it was at the start of the year. For one thing, strikes at some auto plants of the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation have caused shutdowns across the industry. A resulting drop in auto production is expected to hurt sales, as are higher interest rates, analysts said.
Also, 14,300 workers in nine states have walked off the job at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.
The report on construction said that spending fell two-tenths of 1 percent in March, to $600.1 billion at an annual rate. In February, construction spending rose a revised 2.1 percent, in contrast to the decline of 2.3 percent reported originally.
Residential construction spending, which makes up almost half of the total, rose 1 percent from a month earlier. Spending on public projects, like schools, prisons and sewer systems, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent. But spending on commercial projects, like factories and warehouses, fell 2.3 percent.
The report on jobless claims showed that first-time claims increased by a larger-than-expected 28,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 347,000.
The four-week average for new claims, which removes some of the volatility from the weekly data, rose to 330,500, from 321,750 a week earlier.
Rick MacDonald, an economist at MMS International in Belmont, Calif., said the increase was "likely to be related to the temporary effects of the floods and strikes seen through April." That means "the labor market remains stronger than the total claims figures would usually generally indicate," he said.
Flooding in North Dakota and Minnesota put thousands of people out of work during April.

HEADLINE: 3 On-Line Services in Accord on Abusive-Billing Complaints

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
In another blow to the mixed reputation of computer on-line services, three of the nation's biggest providers have entered into a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over complaints of abusive billing and marketing practices.
America Online Inc.; Compuserve Inc., a unit of H & R Block Inc., and the Prodigy Services Corporation, a unit of International Wireless Inc., while admitting no violations of Federal law, have agreed to disclose more fully the terms of their so-called free trial offers and to make it easier for consumers to cancel the services. 
 The three services also promised to end the practice of automatically debiting customers' checking accounts for the cost of monthly service without obtaining advance approval.
In addition, America Online, the largest service, must establish a consumer education program about the use of electronic payment systems, which many on-line services use to bill their customers directly.
America Online must distribute at least 50,000 brochures warning consumers about the dangers of automatic debit payment programs and their right to contest disputed charges.
Spokesmen for each of the three companies said they had long ago ceased most of the practices addressed in the F.T.C. settlement, but today's action formally requires the on-line services to avoid such policies permanently. The F.T.C. voted 5 to 0 to approve the settlement, which carries no fines and does not require the companies to pay any refunds.
But the settlement further tarnishes the image of the new industry that offers consumers and businesses a telephonic doorway to cyberspace. Internet access -- now offered by more than 1,000 companies, has been marred by service blackouts, slow data transmission, unexpectedly high costs and questionable sales practices by some providers.
The F.T.C. sought the settlement after receiving thousands of consumer complaints.
David Medine, a senior staff attorney in the agency's bureau of consumer protection, said that the Government did not seek financial penalties because the companies had already created refund programs for disgruntled customers.
Mr. Medine also said that it was virtually impossible to calculate potential overcharges for the three companies' 12 million customers.
He said that the F.T.C.'s goal was to stop deceptive practices and to require much more extensive disclosure of the terms of on-line service contracts.
"The focus here was to get the whole industry on board with a set of acceptable practices, because this is a new industry and it was important to get in relatively early to set the ground rules for the future," Mr. Medine said.
He added that the on-line services could continue to offer free or low-cost introductory offers. "But they must clearly, conspicuously and unavoidably tell you what you must do to cancel," Mr. Medine said.
Kate Delhagen, senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said that the settlement would alter the industry's marketing practices only modestly, but for the better.
"This move is about full disclosure," Ms. Delhagen said. "It's good for consumers, and absolutely essential as the on-line market begins to sprawl into mainstream America."
Tricia Primrose, spokeswoman for America Online, said that the company had reached an agreement with the F.T.C. last fall on some of these issues. She said that the standards for billing, disclosure and marketing in the settlement announced today should be applied industrywide.
"Ultimately, that's in the best interest of consumers," she said.
America Online earlier this year stopped another billing practice challenged by the F.T.C. The company had added 15 seconds automatically to every Internet connection and rounded up all usage to the next minute.
Thus, a 2-minute-and-46-second call, with the 15 seconds tacked on, becomes a 3-minute-1-second call, which is rounded up and billed as 4 minutes of usage.
Ms. Primrose said all calls are now billed for their exact duration.
Compuserve, in a statement, said that it had not violated any law and asserted that the F.T.C.'s concerns with Compuserve "were minor compared to other industry players."
A company spokesman, Steve Conway, said the company was already complying with most of the provisions of the settlement. "We're happy to take the extra steps at this point," Mr. Conway said, "and we're also glad we had a voice in helping define the regulations."
Mike Darcy, director of public relations at Prodigy, said that the company had already "changed our ways."
"We've been in compliance with these conditions since October 1995," Mr. Darcy said. "We see little financial downside to the business. This is much less costly than litigation."
America Online, based in Dulles, Va., has eight million subscribers. Compuserve, based in Columbus, Ohio, has about three million customers, while Prodigy, of White Plains, has one million subscribers.

HEADLINE: Consumer Still the Big Spender

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The national economy has just turned in its best performance in nine years, and the American consumer's surprisingly exuberant spending is the main reason. In no other six-month period in this decade have increases in consumer spending been as large as they were in the six months through March.
Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4.9 percent from September through March. The last time the six-month rate climbed higher was in 1988, the height of the last expansion, when it reached 5 percent. Consumers, always big players in the economy, have assumed a bigger role than usual in the robust economic growth of the last two quarters. They spent particularly for computers, clothing and health care, but without cutting back on autos, housing, dining out, airline travel, furniture, appliances and recreation. 
 Economists, somewhat surprised, are trying to explain why Americans have been so free with their money. The reasons they come up with suggest that the spending rate will slow.
A mild winter and early Easter encouraged more shopping than usual. Big income tax refunds have helped; many people found they could go to a bank, or to H & R Block, the tax preparer, show their tax returns and borrow against their anticipated refunds. A strong dollar helped, by keeping down import prices. The finance arms of auto companies cut car loan rates by two or three percentage points, to encourage sales. Mortgage rates, having declined last year, are only recently beginning to rise. Sharply rising stock prices made people feel wealthier. And consumer borrowing is at very high levels, having risen particularly among lower-income households.
Computers accounted for the biggest rise in consumer spending in the second quarter, nearly 15 percent of the increase, and apparel was uncharacteristically close behind, at 12 percent.
"There was a long period when people did not purchase apparel, so there was some pent-up demand, and this has now been released and satisfied," said Jay Meltzer, director of LJR Redbook Research, which tracks apparel purchases. "Apparel is a deferrable expenditure, and people felt squeezed and worried about downsizing. But finally they spent the money, and I doubt apparel expenditures will continue this strong."
Layoff announcements are still at high levels. And for most middle-income Americans, wages have not risen by more than the inflation rate in this decade. But those at the upper end of the pay scale are gaining ground and now, for the first time in this six-year expansion -- one of the longest on record -- people at the low end, earning less than $30,000 a year, are getting wage increases that on average exceed the inflation rate. A rise in the minimum wage is a factor, but so is an expanding economy.
"Our most recent surveys show that these workers at the low end have more favorable views of their employment situation," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. "And feeling a little better, they are spending more."
This is not unusual in an expansion. As the unemployment rate falls and labor shortages develop, employers traditionally turn to low-end workers -- hiring a waiter earning $6 an hour, for example, into an $8-an-hour job operating office or factory equipment, and training the person for the work.
"The benefits of economic growth have finally filtered down to the lower-income folks," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist. "What is surprising is that it has taken so long for the first stage to kick in. That has happened earlier in past recoveries."
Job growth has also encouraged spending, particularly among those who had not worked before or for a long time. "You get more spending from people getting a salary for the first time than from people only getting a raise," said Joel Prakken, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc., an economic consulting and forecasting firm.
But Mr. Prakken and most other forecasters expect the current second quarter to be weaker than the first, partly because consumers will spend less. Debt levels, they reason, are too high, and already some statistics show consumers pulling back. Higher mortgage rates are likely to take their toll on home construction and sales, as well as home furnishings, another strong item over the winter months. Auto sales are also beginning to weaken a bit.
Stock prices, which rose so much in the first quarter, are not likely to keep up the pace, diluting the wealth effect. Income tax refunds are winding down now, of course, and advanced payment of this year's estimated tax is now under way, cutting into disposable income. And job growth has to level off, in Mr. Prakken's view.
"It can't keep growing like this," he said, "or in a few years' time the participation rate" -- the number of working-age Americans in the labor force -- "will be out of sight."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Developer Is Trying to Meet Strong Demand for Large Apartments

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Demand for family-size condominium apartments is outstripping the supply in Manhattan's hearty for-sale market, with one developer combining units in his newly built 25-story residential tower to help close the gap.
At the Richmond, a 121-unit condominium on the Upper East Side, 20 of the residences with three or fewer bedrooms, ranging from 738 to 2,200 square feet, have been combined to create larger apartments, many with four bedrooms and 2,300 to 3,500 square feet. 
 The developer of the $40 million project, at the former Morgan Manhattan warehouse at Third Avenue and 80th Street, is a partnership between the Continuum Company of Manhattan, whose president is Ian Bruce Eichner, and a pension fund that Mr. Eichner declined to identify. Part of the building was the subject of long-running legal challenges to plans by Toys "R" Us to build a store in the building's basement, first and second levels. The plan was contested by neighborhood groups and ultimately rejected last December by the New York State Court of Appeals because it violated city zoning regulations.
When the Richmond was started in 1994, there was a demand for large apartments, but Mr. Eichner said he and his partner "were unwilling to build them because the market was just coming out of the real estate downturn." Instead, the apartments were built so they could be combined, he said.
Demand is expected to remain strong if mortgage interest rates remain reasonable, said Corinne R. Pulitzer, senior vice president and assistant director of sales at Charles H. Greenthal Residential Sales Corporation, a Manhattan brokerage.
Adrienne Albert, president of the Marketing Directors Inc., another Manhattan brokerage, said, "The bigger the home, the bigger the price tag, the smaller the opportunity to buy." Prices are also rising, Ms. Albert said.
Data compiled by her firm show that in January and February of this year there were 140 condominium apartments sold on the Upper East Side, up from 76 sold during the same period in 1996.
The rapid pace of sales at two other condominium projects in the neighborhood underscore the demand for large apartments. At the Knickerbocker, on 72d Street and Second Avenue, all 75 apartments were sold at the end of a five-month sales campaign that began in May. A 916-square-foot one-bedroom apartment cost $362,500, and a five-bedroom with 3,434 square feet cost $2.4 million. The project was developed by the Jack Parker Corporation of Forest Hills, Queens.
At the Siena, on 76th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues, all 72 apartments were sold out at the close of a five-month sales program that began in September. A 697-square-foot one-bedroom apartment cost $260,000 and a five-bedroom apartment with 4,075 square feet cost $3.15 million. The project was developed by Rose Associates in partnership with Quinlan & Field Inc. and the Brodsky Organization.
Other condominium projects are also being planned, including one by the Parker Organization. Industry sources said the site would be at 67th Street and First Avenue.
And Trevor Davis and Aby Rosen recently acquired the Cottages, a low-rise development of eight 1930's-era apartments overlooking a garden on Third Avenue between 77th and 78th Streets. The partners are formulating a plan for a high-rise condominium on the site that they said would maintain the character of the courtyard community. Several neighborhood groups are lobbying to preserve the entire complex.
Though Mr. Eichner purchased the former warehouse in 1994 for $11 million -- he then sold the retail condominium to Toys "R" Us for $5.7 million -- the Richmond got off to a sluggish start. Among the reasons were securing financing in the early days of the market's rise, a lengthy renovation process and "the uncertainty and unhappiness" that came with the two-year legal battle, he said.
The community group -- Neighbors "R" Us -- won the battle against the retailer by successfully challenging the validity of the store's building permit. Eli Zabar, who owns E.A.T. and the Vinegar Factory, both popular East Side market-cafes, is under contract to buy the retail condominium. Mr. Zabar is not sure how much, if any, of the retail space he will use for his businesses.
Joyce Matz a spokeswoman for Neighbors "R" Us, said of the sale, "I have not heard any objections to Zabar going in there as long as that store is within the zoning -- because that is what our fight was all about."
Mr. Eichner said that since the court decision in December, contracts have been signed for 53 apartments, compared to the 40 sold in the six prior months. Of the 27 apartments left to sell, contracts are pending on eight, he added.
In the year since sales began, prices for the smaller apartments rose to $285,000 from $190,000 and prices for the largest went to $2.1 million, from $1.7 million. Monthly common charges are $411 to $1,897, and monthly real estate taxes are $416 to $1,916. Amenities at the building, designed by Schuman Lichenstein Claman & Efron of Manhattan, include a sun deck and doorman.

HEADLINE: Albany Finds Tax Revenue Goes Up Again

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 1

 BODY:
In the latest evidence that the region's economy continues to grow at a robust pace, Gov. George E. Pataki said today that the state has collected $500 million more in tax revenues than his budget officials had anticipated just weeks ago.
The announcement marks the third time in two months that the administration has revised upward its projections for tax collections, and means that the state has at least $1.36 billion in surpluses that can be used either to expand programs or avoid budget cuts next year, Mr. Pataki's estimates show. 
 It also comes a day after New York City officials announced that they also had a growing surplus, now $800 million. State officials say that like the city, they have benefited from conditions on Wall Street, where larger than expected bonuses have swelled revenues. They said that the state's personal income tax revenue grew by almost 12 percent in 1996, the largest increase in eight years.
Democrats greeted today's news enthusiastically, saying it shows that the economy is healthy enough to justify spending significantly more than Mr. Pataki has proposed in the $66 billion budget plan that he unveiled in January. In that proposal, the Republican Governor called for reducing spending for higher education, health care and an array of other programs.
"As time goes by, they are finding that our projections were very accurate," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, who has accused Mr. Pataki of underestimating available revenues. The Democrats have called for increasing spending on schools, state colleges and Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and middle class.
But aides to Mr. Pataki warned that the additional money should not be spent helter-skelter, and urged the Legislature to enact many of the cost-saving measures that Mr. Pataki has proposed, particularly for Medicaid.
"The Governor has repeatedly urged the Legislature to avoid a repeat of the mistakes that hurt New York during the late 1980's and early 1990's," said Patricia Woodworth, Mr. Pataki's budget director.
The Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and the Democratic State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, echoed Ms. Woodworth's concerns.
"We are convinced that most of this is being produced on Wall Street, and that is a volatile sector of the economy," Mr. McCall said. "There is no reason to predict that it will continue to produce revenue at this pace. We hope it will, but you can't count on that."
Mr. Pataki contends that the Assembly Democrats, who have passed their own version of a budget, are proposing to spend $5 billion to $6 billion more than his budget proposal. But Mr. Silver said the Democrats are calling for adding only about $700 million to the Governor's plan, an increase of 1 percent.
Despite the fighting over revenue projections, today's announcement virtually insures that this year's budget fight will be mainly over how to spend more, not how to allocate cuts, as was the case in Mr. Pataki's first two years in office.
But though glad tidings about revenues might have been expected to improve the chances for a quick resolution to budget talks, few elected officials here expect that to be the case this year, since the budget talks have become mired in the battle over changing the state's rent laws.
Most legislators predict no progress in the budget talks until the debate over rent control is resolved, and most do not expect that to happen before June 16, the day those laws are scheduled to expire. The new budget should have been enacted by April 1, meaning the budget is now 30 days late. This is the 13th consecutive year that the spending plan is overdue.
The Legislature passed a temporary budget last month that will expire on May 9. Mr. Silver said he would advocate passing a two- or three-week extension of that budget to keep state agencies running. During that time, he said he would urge the Republican-controlled Senate to pass its own version of a spending plan and then appoint a joint Senate-Assembly conference committee to negotiate a compromise.
"The Senate has several options," Mr. Silver said. "They can pass the Governor's plan or the the Assembly's. Or pass one of their own. They choose to do nothing."
But Republicans contend that the differences between the two houses are too great to be worked out in a conference committee.
Mr. Pataki also expressed deep pessimism about the budget talks. "There have been staff discussions, but I have to say very unproductive ones at this point," he said today. "There has been no real progress on any real issue concerning the budget."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
A Booming Economy Made It All Much Easier

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
In the end it cannot be Democrats or Republicans who are credited for coming up with a plan that balances the budget by 2002. It won't even be Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin or the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, though their opposing teams played the leading roles.
Instead, it is the unpredicted and phenomenal strength of the economy that brought the deficit figures down to levels that no one could have imagined even six months ago. So by the time the two parties figured out how to solve -- albeit temporarily -- one of the most vexing problems of the last decade, it was no longer such a vexing problem. 
 "The fact is that a lot of the deficit solved itself," President Clinton's former Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, said today. "It was the one solution that no one thought of."
The new projection for this fiscal year's deficit, $75 billion, amounts to scarcely 1 percent of the gross domestic product. That is a significant piece of change, but on the economic screen it barely rates a blip.
In Europe, nearly all the major economies are trying -- largely unsuccessfully -- to contain their deficits to within 3 percent of their national economies. Japan, which once lectured American politicians about the global evils of big budget deficits, is watching in horror as its own deficit soars to new heights.
But Washington's good luck, in the form of unanticipated revenue pouring into the Treasury, carries with it a dark warning. Because the deficit was not higher, the pressure came off both parties to make the truly painful cuts that everyone had initially thought would be needed to reach balance by 2002. (After 2002, the deficit increases again, though modestly under current projections.)
And if the economy falters in the next five years, the failure to make those cuts could come back to haunt both parties, because it sets the stage for a deficit surge. In fact, Washington's biggest budget problem these days centers on the one figure that no negotiators can whittle down. Interest on the debt accumulated over the last 20 years -- especially the huge run-ups of the late 1980's.
Consider this remarkable statistic: If Washington did not have to make its annual interest payments on that debt, the Federal Government would be running a surplus this year of $172 billion, or half the cost of paying Social Security benefits. Instead, those interest payments will cost the Government $247 billion, or $20 billion less than the entire defense budget for the country.
In their more candid moments, both Democrats and Republicans concede that the strength of the economy has given both parties a tremendous amount of running room.
"I don't think there is any question that the strong economy has helped tremendously in getting a budget that gets to balance in five years," Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, said today after leaving an Administration briefing on the almost-completed budget deal. "And I think they are making some decent decisions. But the low deficit means that they haven't had to make some of the toughest decisions.
"Oddly enough, if the deficit today was higher, it might have forced a more comprehensive reform of entitlements, and it would have made people take a harder look at the Pentagon budget. And it probably would have cooled some of the Republican ardor for tax cuts."
Instead, the Republicans got a tax-cut package that they can crow about, including cuts in some areas that the Administration has time and again insisted make little economic sense.
For example, the final package appears to include a major reduction in estate taxes. Under the plan being hammered out this evening on Capital Hill, the first $1.2 million in inheritance would be exempt from any Federal tax. Now, the first $600,000 in inheritance is excluded from taxation.
Just a week ago, at lunch with economic reporters here, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers dismissed Republican calls for cuts in the estate tax as "pure selfishness," because the exclusion primarily benefits the richest Americans. Only 30,000 Americans pay inheritance tax every year, Mr. Summers said, though the tax brings in $20 billion a year to the Treasury. He was compelled to retract the remark when Republicans protested.
One Administration official said the cut in the estate tax was "an example of the kind of cut we could come to regret" in a downturn.
The Administration has reason to hope that the low deficit will itself help keep the economy rolling along. It was Mr. Rubin's strategy back in 1993 to keep the bond markets happy by cutting the deficit and cutting it again. That, in turn, kept interest rates low. And the low interest rates helped fuel much of the economic growth that the United States has enjoyed in the last four years.
But it is not a formula that anyone, especially Mr. Rubin, expects to last forever. And when the flood of extra revenue stops, the annual quarter-trillion-dollar interest payments on the debt will still be there. Any real plan to balance the budget permanently will have to deal with that problem next.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "KEEPING TRACK: For the Shrinking Deficit, Thank the Economy"
As a percentage of gross domestic product, the Federal budget deficit has been shrinking recently, mostly because the strength of the nation's economy brought in unanticipated revenues. Chart shows revenues, net interest, deficit, entitlements, and discretionary spending as a percentage of gross domestic product for the years 1965 through 1996. Chart also shows the controlling party (Republican or Democrat) of the House and Senate along with the name of the President over the same period of time.

HEADLINE: A Change at 10 Downing Street

 BODY:
It has been a long time between jubilant pints for British Laborites. When Labor last ruled, for those Americans who may have forgotten, Ronald Reagan was not yet President, Michael Jordan was in high school and "The Deer Hunter" won top honors at the Academy Awards. That was 1979, the year Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives swept into office, presaging Mr. Reagan's victory in America a year later. Twice more the Iron Lady was unbeatable, and her successor, John Major, scored a fourth straight Tory triumph five years ago. Yet this election season his party was visibly tired and deeply divided over monetary union with Europe.
So it was no surprise yesterday that Britons turned to Tony Blair's Labor Party, by overwhelming margins. The surprise was that Labor, historically prone to stumbling, turned the tables so effectively on the likable but rattled Mr. Major. Mr. Blair's "New Labor" shed its doctrinaire image and depicted the Conservatives as the party of high taxes and dour ideology, and as the enemy of opportunity -- and did so effectively despite sustained growth and prosperity for much of Britain under the Conservatives. 
 For Americans this has a familiar ring, and Mr. Blair, at 43 the youngest British Prime Minister since 1812, is in some respects very like another Oxford man in the White House. A fine debater, exuding energy and charm, the Scottish-born Laborite wore his hair long in the 1970's, married a high-voltage fellow lawyer, Cherie Booth, and moved so nimbly to the middle he earned the nickname "Tony Blur."
Victory won on such cautious terms has its price. If the economy eventually dips, it will probably be on Mr. Blair's watch. Having promised to reduce taxes and advanced so few concrete proposals, the Laborites can hardly claim a mandate for innovative government. By contrast, Britain's useful third party, the Liberal Democrats under Paddy Ashdown, proposed a 1 percent increase in taxes solely for education, the kind of investment Britain surely needs to remain competitive in a high-tech global economy.
Still, having surprised doubters with his sure-footedness as a campaigner, Mr. Blair may prove an effective leader in Downing Street. Within his party he has shown impressive skill in building as well as expressing a fresh consensus. That is precisely the skill he needs if he is to restore hope and a cease-fire in Northern Ireland, realize greater self-rule in Scotland and Wales and, above all, redefine British purposes and interests within a uniting Europe moving toward a single currency.
Mr. Blair starts with a strong hand, including an unequivocal victory fairly won, and the world's friendly curiosity about the appealing new leader in the oldest of elective Parliaments.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: THE NEGOTIATIONS;
Clinton and Congress in Accord On Budget, Except for Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
White House and Congressional negotiators agreed today on nearly all elements of a plan to balance the Federal budget in five years, but failed to reach a final deal largely because of continuing differences over tax cuts.
The emerging deal would give Republicans many of the tax reductions that they have insisted on and the White House the spending that it sought for President Clinton's priorities, including education, health insurance for children and welfare. 
 The two sides compromised on scaling back Medicare and agreed to a small reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security and other Government benefits.
The President and his staff were in almost constant contact with Republicans throughout the day, as Congressional Democrats fumed on the sidelines, angry about not being consulted more closely and fearful that the deal would give away too much to Republicans.
As the day wore on, the Administration and Republican leaders said that they were still optimistic that the final pieces would fall into place but that they were also wary that their delicate compromise could melt if there was not a breakthrough soon on the remaining issues.
By late tonight, people involved in the process said they were making progress on the main sticking point, a dispute over how specific the agreement would be in apportioning the tax cuts. The Administration, goaded by Congressional Democrats, sought assurances that the cost of the tax reductions would not explode in the five years after the five-year period covered by the agreement.
But Republicans were resisting the White House's demand to put limits on specific types of tax cuts, including a reduction in the capital gains tax, and said they were reluctant to grant the President assurances that his proposals for tuition tax credits would be adopted in just the way he wanted.
After two years of bitter partisan warfare that led to shutdowns of the Government and ultimately helped revive Mr. Clinton's political fortunes, the two sides hammered out a framework that encompassed compromises on nearly all these issues that had divided them:
*Spending for domestic programs would decline $68 billion over five years after accounting for inflation, $20 billion more than Mr. Clinton had first proposed. But the deal would contain provisions for $32 billion in new spending on initiatives that the White House had demanded, including expansions of health insurance for children, student loan programs and restoration of welfare benefits for some legal immigrants. The deal would also include the President's proposals for tuition tax breaks.
*Taxes would be cut by $135 billion over five years, paid for in part by $50 billion in revenue increases from closing loopholes and extending existing taxes that would otherwise expire. The money would be allocated in a yet-to-be determined way between reductions in the capital-gains and estate taxes, credits for families with children and several smaller initiatives.
*The growth in Medicare spending would be cut $115 billion over five years, roughly splitting the difference between each side's most recent offers. The growth in spending for Medicaid would be cut $24 billion.
*Military spending would increase about $23 billion, equivalent to a cut of more than $80 billion after accounting for inflation.
*The Government would revise its formula for calculating cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefits recipients to reduce spending by tens of billions of dollars over the next five years.
Neither side has specified yet how big the adjustment would be, but they would be limited to technical changes by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to address the growing consensus that the Government's main inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, overstates increases in the cost of living.
That the two sides were so close to a deal was a result of not just a willingness to compromise, but also good economic news that over the last several years has helped push the deficit steadily lower, making the size of the problems facing the two parties that much smaller.
Although the deal, if completed, would probably have substantial economic benefits for the nation, it also represents a much broader effort at adapting the priorities of both parties to new realities, the need for a Democratic President and a Republican Congress to work together and the need of both sides to satisfy the demand of a global economy for increased fiscal austerity.
Republican leaders and Administration officials rushed around Capitol Hill to sell the package to their parties, and there appeared to be enough votes from Republicans and centrist Democrats to insure passage. But there was little doubt that liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans found the deal unacceptable.
About a dozen conservative Republicans complained that the deal did not go far enough in cutting taxes, slashing spending on domestic programs and reducing the size and influence of the Government.
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, likened the compromise to a dead fish. "You set it on the table for three or four days," he said, "and it will begin to stink."
House Democrats lashed out at the White House for keeping them in the dark about the details of the negotiations. And they argued that the White House was handing Republicans the opportunity to translate the broad budget agreement into the nitty-gritty of tax and spending bills completely on their terms.
Administration officials acknowledged that they were at risk of not meeting the President's commitment that any budget deal would have to win the support of a majority of the Democrats in both the House and the Senate.
"We want to get a majority of Democrats on board in the deal," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. "We won't have them to begin with, and obviously you're beginning to hear some of the criticisms and concerns before we have had the opportunity to make the case for whatever the agreement is."
Senate Democrats seemed generally supportive. But a large contingent of House liberals appeared quite likely to vote against the deal, despite a concerted effort by top Administration officials, including Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, Franklin D. Raines, the budget chief, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to win them over in a series of meetings.
Part of the Administration's message was that Democrats were never going to get everything that they wanted.

Money Is Tight at Hospitals

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Time is running out to find a permanent way to reimburse hospitals for treating the uninsured, representatives of the state's 26 urban hospitals said yesterday. The Hospital Alliance of New Jersey found that the institutions themselves are in precarious health because the hospitals are now spending almost as much as they take in, Suzanne Ianni, the organization's executive director, said. 
 The hospitals spent $407 million on charity care last year and received $300 million from the state, said Sister Jane Frances Brady, the president of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson. The Legislature voted to reimburse hospitals from the unemployment compensation fund, but only through the end of this year.

HEADLINE: Surprising Central Park, Nature's Pied-a-Terre

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
EVERY year, some 15 million people visit Central Park. That may be an impressive number, but not when you consider that about 20 million people live in the New York region and about 25 million tourists visit annually. That means that every year, 30 million people don't go to Central Park.
Outside of illness, agoraphobia and incarceration, it's hard to imagine why so many would miss out on the chance to escape from the noise and stink of the city without leaving the city. Is it that, at an expanse of 150 city blocks, the place is too big and intimidating? Or is it that the park's winding paths are too frustrating for the busy New Yorker used to the city's efficient linear grid? Or are urban dwellers, at heart, a tribal bunch, sticking to neighborhood shrubbery from tiny Tompkins Square Park to capacious Prospect Park? 
 Whatever the reason, this very subjective guide to some of the best, most unlikely and most useful spots in Central Park should help those unacquainted with its 843 acres stake out a favorite patch of grass and those who visit daily find something new to explore. Each number below corresponds to a number on the map on page 26. (Some highlights are shown at left.) So clip this and put it next to your picnic basket, Rollerblades, bike, tennis racket, guitar, beach blanket, jogging shoes, dog leash, sketchbook, pipe, Hacky Sack, play monologue, brass knuckles or whatever it is you take to Central Park.
 1. BEST PLACE TO SEE A GHOST: Janet and Rosetta Van Der Voort were sisters whose father was so overprotective that he rarely allowed them to leave their parkside home unaccompanied. They were free only to go to the 59th Street Pond in the southeast corner of the park, where they ice-skated in the winter, and a few other places. The sisters grew so close as they grew older that they spurned all potential suitors, dying as spinsters. But, as legend has it, the Van Der Voort sisters, decked out in the same red and purple outfits they wore more than 100 years ago, sometimes return to the pond to figure-skate, in the summer as well as the winter, haunting parents on Central Park South who continue to keep their daughters prisoner.
 2. BEST PLACE FOR ASPIRING NURSES: Ghosts aren't the only creatures haunting the 59th Street Pond. Teen-age Roller bladers turn up in abundance, shunning the disco dancing and backward-riding of the skating area between the Mall and Sheep Meadow. Instead, they prefer more dangerous stunts, like riding down the handrail that leads to the water from the path on the south side of the pond. More often than not, they don't make it to the bottom without falling off. Watching these riders tempt fate can bring out the internal grandmother in everyone. So if bandaging cuts or watching trick riding is an interest of yours, here's a perfect place to gawk.
 3. BEST PAY PHONE: If you're going to go to Central Park and really need to be doing work or making contact with the outside world, why not do it in a way that leaves no doubt about where you are? With circus music blaring in the background and children squealing with delight, the pay phone on the side of the old 90-cents-a-ride carousel (mid-park at 65th Street) offers the perfect way to leave an exciting answering machine message. The view of people bobbing up and down on the backs of wooden horses also provides distraction for a boring call. For a quieter, less colorful environment, try the pay phone at the Dairy visitor center nearby, which also sells the best maps of Central Park.
 4. BEST PLACE TO PRETEND YOU'RE A STAR: Central Park Summerstage's concert program (mid-park at 72d Street) has traditionally been among the best music series in the city, soldiering on despite fiscal crises and the noise complaints of sensitive neighbors on Fifth Avenue. Rarely is a bad band booked, and often the best acts in the world, from places as diverse as Haiti and Okinawa, are flown in to play, with no admission charge, to a jubilant crowd. But when the music's over and the stage is unoccupied, the area is just a big, empty, penned-in playing field crowned by an unoccupied stage. Clamber onto it and sing, dance, juggle, read poetry or make funny. See if you've got what it takes. Never again will you stand as the potentate of such a vast, unpopulated, open-air space in Manhattan.
 5 and 6. BEST PLACES TO READ: For those who don't need to sunbathe and just want a comfortable place to curl up with a book, the area around the boating lake at 72d Street (No. 5) offers comfortable perches and a romantic view. (It also offers the best places to smooch.) Try walking behind the benches at Bethseda Terrace and sitting on the steps that lead directly into the water. Or cross to the other side of the lake via the Bow Bridge and scamper across the giant rock formation to the east. Here, the park recedes into the background, and you can read alone and undisturbed, sitting on the edge of the water.
If you're thumbing through Shakespeare, disregard this advice and sit on a bench in the Shakespeare Garden (No. 6) at 79th Street, where only flowers and foliage mentioned in his plays have been planted. But be forewarned: this pollen-filled hillside is also the best place to irritate allergies.
 7 and 8. BEST PLACES TO LEARN HOW NOT TO MAKE A NUISANCE OF YOURSELF ON IN-LINE SKATES: Even for those who have never tried it before, in-line skating is a cinch. It's stopping that's difficult, and pedestrian-terrorizing neophytes unschooled in the art of braking have given the entire population of Rollerbladers a bad name. Recognizing that conserving Central Park means teaching skaters how to stop without grabbing onto trees or crashing into bushes, the Parks Department has thoughtfully instituted a skating patrol that holds free stopping clinics at Women's Gate (No. 7, at 72d Street and Central Park West) and at Inventors' Gate (No. 8, at 72d Street and Fifth Avenue). On weekends from 12:30 to 5:30 P.M., capable volunteers teach the latest techniques in deceleration.
Skates and lessons are available on weekends at Wollman Rink, at 62d Street. One-hour classes are held every Saturday at 9:30 A.M.; the cost is $15, which includes skate rental, but reservations are necessary 24 hours in advance. (Without skate rental, the lesson costs $12.) Reservations: (212) 369-1010, extension 15.
 9. BEST MICROCOSM OF AN OCEAN: Manhattan may be lacking in beach-front property, but that doesn't keep hobbyists from owning boats. They've just been scaled down, like a Manhattan apartment in relation to a comparably priced one elsewhere. Every Saturday from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. at the Kerbs Model Boathouse, on the east side of the park at 74th Street, members of the Model Yacht Club of Central Park bring radio-controlled boats and have a miniature regatta. For many, these $1,000 toys are serious business. So watch (the vessels as well as their owners). But don't disturb these junior captains, they can be a cranky lot.
10. MOST CONSIDERATE GESTURE: The ice cream and drink stand just to the north of the Kerbs Model Boathouse may be the only snack shop that caters to dogs as well as humans. On the floor near the tables someone has placed a big yellow bowl with the words "The Pet" on the side. Inside is all the water your pet can lap. There is a theory that this free service is a method of keeping pets from drinking out of the yachting pond.
11. BEST PLACE TO GET LOST: With some 63 miles of serpentine paths, Central Park is not for city slickers trying to get somewhere. It's for those trying to get lost. And one of the best places to do this is the Ramble, mid-park at 77th Street. The Central Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned the Ramble as "the perfect realization of the wild garden." But the wilderness has taken over his garden, and all kinds of trampled plants, fallen trees and dense overgrowth line the intricate network of climbing and falling paths. Nonetheless, there are great boons of aromatic sassafras, sweet gum and black cherry trees.
12. BEST VIEW: Where else in Manhattan except Belvedere Castle (mid-park at 79th Street) can one climb just two flights of stairs and have a bird's-eye view? Long a favorite spot for ornithologists, the ostentatious roof of the building offers prime viewing of dozens of baseball and soccer games in progress, Shakespeare in the Park and all kinds of cardinals, warblers, hawks and, um, pigeons. The castle is also home to the park's best visitor center, the Henry Luce Nature Observatory, which sells binoculars and bird-watching books in addition to offering microscopes and magnifying glasses for children to examine rock, plant and animal-hair samples.
13. MOST EFFICIENT PLACE TO SUNBATHE: With spring weather so varied and unpredictable this year, it's been difficult planning enough sunbathing time to get rid of winter pallor. In addition, whenever the sun shines, the Sheep Meadow grows much too crowded to make lying out relaxing. So why not try lying on the less-populated grassy banks of the Metropolitan Museum of Art? It's not just the sloping hill that makes this an ideal place for tanning, it's the reflective glass sides of the museum, which maximize the intensity of the sun.
14 and 15. BEST PLAYGROUNDS: There are many different strata of playgrounds in Central Park. There are spartan ones with swings and slides. Then there are fanciful ones, like the Alice in Wonderland statue at 75th Street that doubles as a jungle gym. But the queen of playgrounds is the Timberform, those log constructions that connect slides, balance beams, tire swings, mesh bridges and more into a giant fun fort. The best of these are at 84th Street, next to the Met (No. 14), and at 86th Street, on the west side of the park (No. 15). Both have similar features, like knotted ropes for children to swing on.
The advantage of the one near the Met is that it has checkers and chess tables that parents can use to amuse themselves, and the Timberform is a little more elaborate. The play area on the west side, though, has a better attached playground for toddlers, with turtle statues to climb on and a cube with sides of low, wide slides. Make sure you come to the right place, because the west side playground lies only 50 yards away from a disheveled swing area that ranks as the park's worst playground.
16. BEST INTRODUCTION TO POSHNESS: Manhattan may not be the first place that comes to mind when one thinks of genteel lawn sports, but the city boasts one of the biggest croquet organizations in the country. On weekends at Bowling Greens, near West 69th Street, sportsmen and women decked out in white hunch over wooden mallets, perspiring from concentration more than exertion as they knock small balls through wickets. This is the home of the New York Croquet Club, which begins its season tomorrow. The club is not as exclusive as it sounds: beginning on May 13, it will be offering free introductory clinics on Tuesdays at 5:30 P.M. Information: (212) 369-7949.
17 and 18. BEST PICKUP SPOTS: Grab a pair of jogging shoes and enter the park at Engineer's Gate, at 90th Street and Fifth Avenue (No. 17), the starting point for most joggers who make laps around the giant reservoir. Then stretch. Stretch for as long as it takes to find an unaccompanied man or woman who interests you. Everybody knows the loneliness of the long-distance runner, so make a little jogging small talk (don't ask for a cigarette) and then volunteer your services as a running partner. It doesn't matter if you're not in shape. Just pick somebody who appears to have the same stamina level. It's a good indicator of compatibility as well.
For those who can work on the fly, pickup artists say that the road encircling Central Park is a good place to meet skaters and joggers. Asking something as dumb as "So, how many times have you been around?" has been known to work. If you time your conversation carefully, by the time you reach the intersection of East Drive, just below 72d Street (No. 18), you can persuade your new friend to take a break at the rest area there and have a less breathless discussion. If the object of your desire is on a bicycle, this is also a good place to signal him or her to pull over to talk. Finally, if a more sedentary sport is your style, the New York Croquet Club (see No. 16) also gets high ratings as a singles club.
19. CHEAPEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE CONSUMER ITEMS IN THE PARK: Central Park was designed some 140 years ago as a garden of contrasts, where the poor could escape the claustrophobia of their tenements and the rich could parade their fine horses and carriages. This spirit still survives in the tennis building that presides over the courts on the west side of the park at 96th Street. Here, gustatory paradise is only a nickel away. Jars of lollipops, chewy candies, licorice and gum sit on the counter of the tennis desk for 5 to 15 cents apiece. For those more interested in continuing the Central Park tradition of parading their finery, brand-name tennis outfits and rackets lie two steps and $200 away.
20. BEST PLACE TO BUY A SODA FOR STREET PRICE: Central Park offers a textbook example of the economic principle of scarcity. The deeper one ventures into the park -- away from the land of corner delis and bodegas -- the more costly the price of sodas, juices and those sugar-water drinks that come in flavors that combine two or more fruits. But for the dedicated bargain hunter, in the indoor rest area of the North Meadow Recreation Center (mid-park at 97th Street) stands a lonely soda machine. It is generally ignored by those who use the rappelling wall or play basketball, handball and squash nearby. But at 75 cents a pop, it's a bargain.
21. BEST PLACE TO CONTEMPLATE THE MEANING OF LIFE: Follow the paths that circumscribe the pool on 100th or 103d Streets to where the water narrows into the Central Park Loch. At the first waterfall, you'll find that alongside the cascade are shelves of rocks. Come alone, because they're built just for one. Take a seat facing eastward with your back to the waterfall. As the verdant green blots out the sun, the sound of falling water shuts out competing noises, and a sensuous mossy smell fills the air. Close your eyes and relax. You're not in Manhattan anymore. No, you're alone with nature. And nature is your friend, its water carrying your problems downstream. Do you feel better now?
22. BEST PLACE FOR A WEDDING: A relationship, it has been said, is like a garden. With diligent and tender care, it grows and it blooms; but the moment it is neglected, it begins to wither. So what better place is there to get married than the most diligently and tenderly cared-for garden in Central Park? At the Conservatory Garden, at 105th Street on the east side, you can exchange your vows inside a frame of pink, purple, russet and white leaves as a fragrant floral cocktail fills the air. The garden also boasts many shrouded, shaded fountains and benches for guests to wander off to. For distant or unpopular relatives, there's a remote balcony where they can observe the wedding from on high without interrupting it. Information on arranging a wedding: (212) 360-2766.
23, 24 and 25. BEST PLACES FOR A PICNIC: In days of yore, the hilltops in the northern end of the park were ideal places for Revolutionary War and War of 1812 forts. The only problem was that by the time New Yorkers got around to constructing forts, the wars they were meant to protect the city from were usually just weeks away from ending. So there's no bloody legacy at these places, and most of the forts are long since gone, making the grassy, stone-ledged sites of Nutter's Battery (No. 23) and Fort Clinton (No. 24), both on the east side of the park at 107th Street, good snacking spots for small groups. They also offer a great view of Harlem.
For those who prefer sitting on benches, there are a dozen or so picnic tables atop the Great Hill on 106th Street (No. 25) on the west side. Perhaps because it takes a little work to get there, the area is usually sparsely populated.
26. BEST (AND ONLY) BEACH: Proof that Central Park is as man-made as the skyscrapers that surround it comes in odd inconsistencies like this tiny beach. Looking like a large yellow blanket that somebody dropped in the dirt, it lies on the Harlem Meer on the east side of the park at 107th Street. No more than 50 feet wide, it offers fine, yellow sand to grind between your toes. Often, braver and heartier park denizens can be found wading into the water from this mini-beach. A wiser way to use this water is by fishing: the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center at the Meer lends poles without charge. If you want to swim, try the hideously designed Lasker Rink and Pool at the southeastern corner of the Meer. But you'll have to wait until swimming season begins on July 5.

HEADLINE: Up With Their Rents! Albany Aims at the Rich

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

 BODY:
Raoul Felder, divorce lawyer to the rich and famous, fought like a bull to hold on to his rent-regulated apartment overlooking Central Park. In a white-glove building on Fifth Avenue, it was his three-bedroom home of 18 years. He could stand at his windows and gaze upon New Jersey here, Queens there, all for $4,000 a month.
But, under the luxury decontrol laws that many believe will be expanded in a compromise settlement of New York's rent regulations battle, Mr. Felder lost. His apartment, resplendent with a remodeled kitchen, was deregulated, and his rent nearly quintupled. So, rather than pay $18,000 to $20,000 a month in rent, he bought a triplex penthouse on Sutton Place. He now concedes he probably should have done that long ago. 
 "I was hardly a victim," Mr. Felder said. "Yes, I was very angry, because I had the advantage of rent stabilization for so many years and it was a fabulous deal. But the truth was, there was no reason for me to have it. I was absolutely using the system because it was so easy to do. And, in truth, the Fifth Avenue apartment was too small."
For the last few years, New York City landlords have sought with frequent success to dethrone those who could be seen as the welfare queens of the rent control debate: the Raoul Felders, Mia Farrows and Dick Cavetts who have enjoyed a benefit meant for that majority of regulated tenants who are poor or working class.
In Albany, behind closed doors, these wealthy tenants are the real targets of many politicians who are negotiating to preserve the rent control system by weeding out the abuse. Publicly, the politicians speak of all or nothing, of killing rent protections entirely or preserving them for all. Privately, they talk most about two options: expanding vacancy decontrol -- the deregulation of an apartment when the tenant leaves, which now exists only for rents above $2,000 -- and expanding the luxury decontrol system to include the affluent and not merely the very rich.
If luxury decontrol is to be expanded, real estate experts say, there are problems with the language of the law and kinks in the system that need to be fixed. But at its base, in their estimation, the luxury decontrol system has been working as intended. Although most cases, like Mr. Felder's, have been contentious, few have ended up in court. Instead, the thrusts by landlords and parries by tenants have typically culminated in heated, typically Manhattan-style real estate negotiations. In almost all cases, tenants have had more than acceptable options once they lost their rent controls. Many if not most tenants have remained in their apartments, paying the much higher rents they could have afforded all along.
Tenant and landlord advocates say that if Albany does expand the three-year-old luxury decontrol system, it should change the system's kinks, because they have created inequities and absurdities and, unaddressed, are likely to create more.
For instance, tenants who, confused by the paperwork, do not complete their forms properly or on time, find their apartments deregulated by default, whatever their income. One tenant lost his regulated rent because he failed to sign the form.
On the other hand, those with very high incomes can retain their lower rents if they pay less than $2,000 a month, be it for a pied-a-terre or an $800-a-month penthouse apartment on Central Park West. (They do exist.) The law covers only regulated tenants who earn over $250,000 a year for two consecutive years and who pay more than $2,000 in rent.
That universe is quite small. While New York State housing officials say they have no idea how many very wealthy tenants there are in rent-protected apartments, the Census Bureau, at the request of The New York Times, tabulated the information for the first time yesterday. According to those statistics, 3,840 tenants with incomes over $250,000 enjoy rent protections in New York City, or 0.35 percent of the 1.1 million regulated tenants. How many of those pay rents of $2,000 or more is not known.
That number presumably includes what landlords say are the scores, if not hundreds, of diplomatic residences that are rent-regulated. New York State, however, has decided it cannot deregulate these residences. The apartments are usually leased by the countries the diplomats represent; neither countries nor diplomatic personnel file local tax returns, so the state considers their income unknowable.
"It's ridiculous," said Robert D. Goldstein, a lawyer whose firm, Borah Goldstein Altschuler & Schwartz, has represented landlords in deregulation actions against Spain and Libya. "I can't imagine that there's a country that wouldn't have an adjusted gross income of more than $250,000 a year."
By the end of last year, building owners had deregulated 1,404 apartments of wealthy tenants. But they had tried and failed to win state approval for deregulating almost twice that many, often because of a bureaucratic problem when the authorities cannot find a tenant's New York State tax returns -- the document they have decided to use for income proof -- because a name or an address is recorded differently on different forms. (State officials say they cannot use Social Security numbers because it would violate Federal privacy laws.) So the tenants get to keep their lower rents.
"Ultimately, about 15 percent of my cases are dismissed because the state can't match the tenants' names, as given to them by the tenants, to any New York State tax returns," said Jeffrey Turkel, a real estate lawyer who represents landlords in deregulation cases for Rosenberg & Estis in Manhattan.
While some affluent tenants have succumbed to their landlords' attempt to decontrol their rents without a fight, most have bought themselves an average of one year or more at low-rent levels by contesting the deregulation.
"Some will just give up the ghost and say you've got me," said Arnold Goldstein, the president of Samson Management and acting chairman of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords group. "But with most people, we've all been doing what I call a minuet over money."
When the state orders an apartment deregulated, some tenants in cooperative buildings buy their apartments. Others, like Mr. Cavett, agree to pay higher rents, often by negotiating a graduated increase to market rent levels. Most wealthy renters have invested heavily in their apartments, treating them as if they owned them, and do not want to lose their homes.
"If you've already poured $150,000 into a place, the idea of paying an extra $3,000 a month is still a good deal," said Robert Goldstein, whose firm has handled more than 1,000 deregulations.
Unlike tenants whose lower rents sometimes subsidize the laying down of marble over bare wood floors, most tenants in rent-regulated apartments scrape by on less than $30,000 a year.
Many tenant advocates do not think that there should be any means test tied to rent protections, saying that the system was not designed to give subsidies to individuals but to keep housing affordable.
"Granted, at the $250,000 level, these are not people who are going to be homeless," said Michael McKee, a leader of the New York State Tenant and Neighbors Coalition. "But once you establish a means test, there will always be an attempt to lower the threshold."
Indeed, proposals for expanding luxury decontrol call for lowering the income threshold and lowering or eliminating the rent cutoff. Under the most ambitious proposal, tenants with household incomes of $100,000 annually -- which Mr. McKee calls "nothing in this city" -- would lose rent protection regardless of how much rent they pay. If there is a compromise settlement, however, it is more likely that the income threshold will be $150,000 or $200,000 and that the rent cutoff will be lower than $2,000, but not eliminated.
The other option under consideration is expanding vacancy decontrol. Now, landlords can deregulate apartments with rents at $2,000 or over when they are vacated. By the end of 1996, 1,350 apartments had been deregulated that way.
Most building owners have taken a blitzkrieg approach to deregulating their luxury buildings on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side of Manhattan, where rents are highest. They have tried to lift the rent controls on every apartment renting at $2,000 or more, essentially asking tenants to prove that their income is not high enough.
Even some tenants who do not make enough money to be deregulated find the process unsettling, especially older, long-term tenants.
"Tenants are annoyed with the paperwork," said Gary Jacob, executive vice president of Jacob Management. "They'll say to me, 'I've already told you I don't make that kind of money. Are you calling me a liar?' "
Building owners and their lawyers do have many tales of tenant lies, the lengths to which wealthy tenants have gone to hide their income and keep their rent protections. Because the law specifies incomes of $250,000 or more for two years, they say, some simply arrange for their income to be divided so that $245,000 is reported one year and $255,000 the next. Some owners say that some husbands and wives are claiming to live separate lives, one in the city, one in the country home, to split their income.
Mr. Jacobs told of one Upper East Side tenant who amended his tax return to include a capital gain loss on stock that had become worthless, bringing his income $10,000 below the threshold. He kept his lower rent.
Mr. Turkel, the lawyer, told what he termed a cautionary tale of another wealthy man, who fought the lifting of protections on his grand apartment on Fifth Avenue through every level of appeal. In 1994, when he lost his first bid, the man could have bought his apartment for $800,000. Instead, he did so this year, for $1.3 million.
When the state ruled that Spain and Libya could keep the rent controls on their official residences because they did not file New York State income taxes, the landlords tried another tactic. They went to Federal court to try to prove that the apartments were not the primary residences of Spain or Libya. (Rent protections exist only on primary residences).
Both nations' representatives ended up in real estate negotiations with their landlords. Spain bought its apartment. What happened with Libya could not be determined.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 1997, SaturdayMay 10, 1997, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about luxury decontrol rules for rent-regulated apartments referred incorrectly in some editions to the percentage of tenants with rent protections in New York City who have incomes over $250,000. According to an analysis by the Census Bureau, there are 3,840 such tenants, or 0.35 percent of the roughly 1.1 million regulated apartments -- not 0.003 percent.
A front-page chart on May 2 about rent regulation referred incorrectly to the apartments described. There are 1.1 million rent-regulated apartments in New York City; that is not the total number of rental apartments. In addition, the chart gave an incorrect percentage for the units occupied by families earning $100,000 or more. About 5 percent of the rent-regulated apartments not 8 percent, are in that category.

As of today, each of the three Presidents whom American historians routinely rate most highly has his own oversized memorial in the nation's capital. It took George Washington 86 years to reach the Mall. Abraham Lincoln had to wait 57 years. F.D.R. made it to the Tidal Basin in just 52.
Washington was sui generis, of course; he invented the job. And at first glance, his two ablest successors seem wholly dissimilar. The Roosevelt estate, high above the Hudson River at Hyde Park, was very far in every sense from the log cabin on Nolin Creek in Kentucky where Lincoln was born. 
 Lincoln had never managed anything larger than a two-man law office when he became President; F.D.R. had helped run the Navy Department in wartime and was twice Governor of New York. Lincoln was plagued by melancholy; Roosevelt remained so relentlessly sunny, despite paraplegia and the pressures of 12 years in the White House, that one dazzled aide said he seemed to have been "psychoanalyzed by God."
Yet the two had much in common. Each was hugely ambitious. Lincoln declared himself a candidate for state office at 23, before he owned so much as a suit of clothes. F.D.R. was just 25 when he began outlining for friends the path he planned to follow to the Presidency.
Both believed that the United States had a unique part to play in the world and that the Presidency was, as Roosevelt said, "pre-eminently a place of moral leadership." Each found solace in the conviction that he was merely the instrument of a higher power whose purposes were unknowable but who was nonetheless active in the affairs of men.
Both were denounced as unprincipled for failing to move as fast or as consistently as their more ideologically inclined contemporaries would have liked. "Lincoln was a sad man because he couldn't get it all at once," Roosevelt told a friend. "Nobody can." In the interest of getting all they could, both Roosevelt and Lincoln were often accused of being too clever by half.
Above all, they were masterful politicians who managed to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win power -- polio in Roosevelt's case, abject poverty in Lincoln's.
Along the way, each learned hard lessons about the value of keeping one's own counsel, the pace at which public opinion can be shaped, the strategic uses of delay and flattery and the miraculous power of patronage to change men's minds.
We've heard a great deal about the sins of "career politicians." Everything would run more smoothly, we are told, if government were just placed in the hands of gifted amateurs, distinguished men and women who would contribute a limited amount of their valuable time to bringing efficiency and objectivity to government, then return to their real jobs to give someone else a chance.
But the achievements of Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln are the most vivid possible refutation of that notion. When the survival of this country was most seriously threatened -- by domestic enemies during Lincoln's watch, and, when Roosevelt was at the helm, by economic disaster and the crippling self-doubt it fostered, and then by foreign enemies -- the American people wisely turned to men who had devoted their whole lives to politics.
In that sweaty, sometimes squalid world, they had mastered the essential skills of Presidential leadership. Had we turned to amateurs, no matter how well-intentioned, in those anxious times, government of the people, by the people, and for the people might long since have perished from the earth.

HEADLINE: Foreign Business Investment Grows in Ukraine

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your April 9 news article "Ukraine Staggers on Path to the Free Market" misrepresents the situation regarding the Government of Ukraine's purchase of domestically produced grain, as well as my association with United Energy Systems. It also gives the impression that foreign companies are fleeing Ukraine, instead of entering in ever-increasing numbers. 
 You quote an American businessman as saying that the Government of Ukraine last fall confiscated all grain produced in Ukraine.
In fact, the Government decided early last year that it needed to purchase grain to insure that the Ukrainian people would have enough of this staple. The Government bought five million tons at an average price that was close to world prices, not at the lower price you cited. Any business person was free to buy the rest.
The article repeats charges that I used a stake in United Energy Systems to reap millions of dollars. These charges are false. I have no stake in U.E.S.
Ukraine is far from being the economic disaster that you portray. Foreign investment now stands at about $1.5 billion. From 1995 to 1996 foreign investment in Ukraine increased by 50 percent. According to the United States Department of Commerce, within the same time frame total foreign imports into Ukraine increased by 21.5 percent.
To improve access by foreign investors, an Advisory Board on Foreign Investments was created in March. This board is headed by President Leonid Kuchma and includes top Ukrainian leaders as well as representatives of many multinational corporations. The board allows foreign companies and Ukrainian leaders to work together to create a more hospitable climate for foreign investment.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies on Jobless Data And Swiss Remark on Strength

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied yesterday, overcoming early weakness after a Swiss central banker said he was not concerned about the currency's strength and the Labor Department reported the lowest jobless rate in 24 years.
The combination of healthy American employment data and remarks by Bruno Gehrig, a member of the Swiss National Bank's governing board, pushed the dollar to its highest weekly closing levels against the mark and yen this year. 
 Mr. Gehrig told reporters at an appearance in Switzerland that "I'm not worried about the high dollar at all." He also said Switzerland's own weak economy made it unlikely that interest rates there would rise anytime soon.
Traders said Mr. Gehrig's remarks surprised the market and caused a sharp selloff in the Swiss franc that led to weakness in most other currencies against the dollar, reversing its decline earlier in the day.
"The Swiss thing kind of got the ball rolling," said Bob Houck, vice president for foreign exchange at the Norwest Bank Corporation in Minneapolis. "Any time you see a comment for a stronger dollar, that's just kind of a green light to buy it."
The pound initially fell, then rebounded, in the aftermath of the Labor Party's landslide victory over the incumbent Conservatives in Britain. The pound's comeback indirectly helped bolster the dollar against the Japanese and German currencies, but sterling ended slightly weaker against the dollar.
In New York, the dollar settled at 126.57 yen, up from 126.51 yen on Thursday and up 9.2 percent for the year. The dollar cost 1.7293 marks, up from 1.7217 and up 12.2 percent for the year. The dollar cost 1.4715 Swiss francs, up from 1.4695. The pound cost $1.6210, down from $1.6242.
After strengthening on the Swiss central banker's remarks, the dollar retreated briefly on the Labor Department's report that the economy created only 142,000 jobs in April, lower than anticipated.
But the dollar's advance quickly resumed as traders focused on other elements of the report depicting healthy growth, notably that the jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent from 5.2, the lowest since 1973.

HEADLINE: Lode of Brazilian Nationalism: A State Mine Goes Private

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, May 1

 BODY:
The unexpected court-ordered delay in the Brazilian Government's sale of of shares in its state-owned mining company, after a barrage of legal challenges backed by popular protests, called upon ideas and images that many South American leaders had taken for dead as they moved toward privatizing their economies.
A Government sale of 45 percent of the voting shares of the state-mining company, Vale do Rio Doce, from which the Government expected to earn $5 billion, had been set for Tuesday. But the sale, billed as the largest privatization ever undertaken in South America, was blocked by an injunction issued by a court in Sao Paulo. The judge said he would reconsider the case next week. 
 [Reuters reported on Friday that Judge Democrito Ramos Reinaldo from the Superior Court of Justice had said he would consider the case over the weekend and might have a decision on Monday. The Government then rescheduled the sale for Monday, and indicated that if it had to keep rescheduling on a day-by-day basis, it would do so.]
Most analysts expect the sale to take place ultimately. The question is when. In the meantime, the Government is trying to signal to investment companies its commitment to the sale while facing a daunting task in trying to overcome widespread popular opposition.
At a protest in front of the stock exchange this week, a 15-year-old student, Mateus Torres, showed up wrapped in a banner bearing the likeness of Ernesto (Che) Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary gunned down in Bolivia in 1967. Others spoke of foreigners taking over the country's resources.
"The sale of Vale is the first step toward the internationalization of the Amazon," read one placard.
"If Vale gets privatized, in five years it would be in the hands of foreigners," complained Jonas Alves Correa, 62, a retired employee of the Banco do Brasil, which is also Government-owned. "Vale is the pride of Brazil."
Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former Finance Minister, is believed to be the only South American leader ever elected solely for controlling inflation. But the economic restructuring he says is needed has encountered problems in recent weeks, as it touches issues like civil service protections and state ownership of mining rights, once considered sacrosanct.
"All of this is relating to something that's very deep in Latin America, and that is nationalism," said Roberto da Matta, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.
While the principals of the two groups bidding for the mining company are Brazilian, many protesters predicted they would sell their holdings after the five-year minimum ownership now required.
That prospect appeared to tap deep fears, even though the protesters, some observers noted, had little in common with those who own the majority of the country's wealth, and who would presumably benefit from keeping the world's biggest mining company in Brazilian hands.
In a front-page editorial on Thursday, the influential Globo newspaper said the objections were based on obsolete notions.
"The auction of Vale do Rio Doce probably marks the last appearance of an idea which had a much longer career than it merited: that something is only 'of Brazil' if it belongs to the state," it said. In the 1970's -- an age of "omnivorous multinationals" and "incompetent national companies" -- that made sense.
"But today the reality is much more complicated," it said. "Vale is of Brazil when it pays taxes here and creates jobs here. And invests here and brings dollars instead of selling them outside."
Some here said the proposed sale had become a heated issue because beyond the privatization lay other changes that would erode the protections Brazilian workers had come to expect from the state.
"The tradition of protecting special interests is very strong in Brazil," said Walder de Goes, a political analyst in Brasilia. "When you have a set of reforms that threaten them, they strike back."
Mauricio Reveco, a specialist in Latin American privatizations at Salomon Brothers in New York, agreed. "It's not really an issue of Vale remaining in Brazilian hands, but it facilitates opposition to complain that Brazilian natural resources will be taken over by foreigners," he said.
Opposition politicians turned to Brazilian courts, Mr. de Goes said, because they did not have the votes in the Brazilian Congress to block the sale. Along with the Brazilian Bar Association, the Omsbudsman's office and labor unions, they filed more than 100 legal actions around the country, successfully seeking a judge who would issue an injunction to prevent the sale.
A squad of Government lawyers failed to overcome the challenges, even after the stock exchange was kept open hours after its normal quitting time to accept bids.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Budget Agreement Gives Treasuries a Lift

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
It was a clean sweep for the bulls in the Treasury market this week. Although prices slipped early yesterday in response to the mixed labor report, after posting significant gains through the week on data that suggested the economy might be slowing, they rallied again in the afternoon on news that President Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders agreed on a balanced budget plan.
A balanced budget would shrink the deficit, meaning the Government would have to sell fewer bonds. That, in turn, would make existing securities scarcer, sending prices higher and yields lower. 
 The 30-year bond rose 16/32 yesterday, to 96 29/32, yielding 6.88 percent, down from 6.91 percent on Thursday and down 26 basis points, or more than a quarter of a percentage point, for the week.
Traders noted, however, that the market was limited on the upside ahead of the Government's quarterly refunding next week, as the Treasury prepared to sell $29 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday and 10-year notes on Wednesday.
Some investors were beginning to suggest that the Fed might not need to raise short-term rates much further, while others said the odds in favor of a rate had improved from 70 percent to even.
One thing that clouded the outlook for Fed monetary policy was yesterday's report that the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent last month, the lowest since 1973, from 5.2 percent in March. But the economy added only 142,000 nonfarm jobs, and average hourly earnings fell unexpectedly by 1 cent.
"While the slower pace of job creations was greatly heralded by credit market investors, everyone is keenly aware of the fact that nothing in this report truly signaled a complete easing of tight labor market conditions," said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. "If the Fed expressed concern when the unemployment rate equaled 5.2 percent, one can be sure that the new 4.9 percent figure is definitely not going to unleash any new resurgence of complacency."
Discussing the outlook for Fed action, Mr. Chan added, "It's clear that their apparent intention to raise short-term rates one or even two more times in 25-basis-point increments before the end of the year is very much alive."
He added that with the latest three-month moving average of nonfarm payrolls still hovering near 200,000, it was still pointing in the direction of higher-than-expected growth. "And when one realizes that labor unrest and weather problems may have understated actual conditions," Mr. Chan said, "one can understand why the market was able to deliver only a lukewarm response to the overall report."
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said the economy was slowing as expected, but low unemployment would keep the Fed wary and make market participants cautious.
"For the Fed, this morning's report was a mixed bag" Mr. McCarthy said. "On one hand, slower growth in employment and declining wage pressures indicate an economy that is not in danger of overheating."
On the other hand, he said, the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years has to be a cause for concern because in 1973, when unemployment was below 5 percent for most of the year, the inflation rate soared from 3 percent to 8 percent.
Mr. McCarthy pointed out, however, that there was an Arab oil embargo in 1973, and average hourly earnings were rising by 6.5 percent.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the yet-to-be-sold three-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.40 percent, and the 10-year note, 6.67 percent.

HEADLINE: An Uneven Budget Agreement

 BODY:
Hours after the Government announced that the nation's unemployment rate had fallen below 5 percent for the first time in 24 years, President Clinton and Republican leaders crowed that they had produced another piece of historic economic news -- an agreement to erase the Federal budget deficit by the year 2002. The plan appears to have clear sailing in the Senate and only marginal opposition from liberals in the House. But it is too early to tell how much praise is warranted.
Balancing the budget in 2002 is a modest achievement because a roaring economy has brought the deficit down to a level that poses no financial threat. What must be determined is whether the plan will leave large deficits looming in the years after 2002. There are reasons to fear the worst. The plan's tax cuts will escalate over time. It also leaves the long-term financial plight of Medicare largely untouched. But the worst feature of the agreement is its unfairness. It cuts spending programs that are in large part designed to bring disadvantaged workers into the economic mainstream, to pay for tax cuts that go overwhelmingly to the wealthy. 
 Discretionary spending is cut by about 10 percent by 2002. That is much less than what the two sides were debating earlier in the week. Yet the cut permanently buries almost all of Mr. Clinton's training, education and investment initiatives that he promised in 1992 would be centerpieces of his economic development strategy.
The agreement would cut Medicare payments to physicians by about $100 billion, a temporary respite that does little to thwart the upward spiral of costs over time. Medicaid is cut, for hospitals that treat the indigent, also without reforming the plan for the future. The plan makes no progress in accelerating corrections in the Government's gauge of inflation -- the fairest way to cut the deficit because it reduces Social Security benefits and raises tax collections to their proper levels.
The plan cuts taxes by about $85 billion through 2002 and by an additional $165 billion during the five years thereafter. None of the proposed tax cuts -- for capital gains, estates, college tuition and children -- make economic sense. None are carefully targeted to spur savings and investment. All will mostly bypass the poor, and the capital gains and estates measures will enrich a tiny tier of families atop the income ladder.
There are also virtues. The plan will extend health coverage to many uninsured children, reinstate government assistance to some disabled immigrants and create more workfare slots for childless adults who would otherwise be cut off from food stamps by last year's welfare law. The biggest plus is what the plan does not do -- whack discretionary spending, as under previous Congressional plans, by 25 percent or more.
The remarkable spectacle yesterday was how many politicians lined up in support. Senate Republicans appear firmly behind the agreement. So is Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader. In the House, only liberals were muttering misgivings. But there is a long path between yesterday's celebrations and actual legislation. What the White House and Congressional leaders must show is that the agreement does not push the deficits into the future or cut spending on valuable discretionary programs. If they meet both these tests, then there is at least some payback -- though no excuse -- for the uneven treatment of rich and poor.

HEADLINE: Mexican Chief Turns Down U.S. Requests On Drug War

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 2

 BODY:
Three days before President Clinton's first visit here, President Ernesto Zedillo today strongly rejected two proposals by American law enforcement officials aimed at improving security for United States drug agents in Mexico and at detecting police corruption. He characterized the proposals as outrageous encroachments on Mexican sovereignty.
There can be "no further discussion" of a request that American anti-drug agents receive official permission to carry sidearms in Mexico for their own security, Mr. Zedillo said. And he dismissed a proposal that American officials administer polygraph tests to Mexicans applying for sensitive posts in the country's troubled anti-drug agencies. 
 "That's ridiculous!" Mr. Zedillo said. "Imagine if I told President Clinton that we want to have a hearing in Mexico to accept his Attorney General! I mean that's ridiculous."
The timing of Mr. Zedillo's statements and the vehemence with which he made them suggested that he was moving to pre-empt any United States arm-twisting for breakthrough agreements on anti-narcotics issues during Mr. Clinton's visit, especially since domestic critics of Mr. Zedillo have said he has cooperated too meekly with the United States Government.
"There is a line that's been drawn very strongly, and that is our sovereignty," Mr. Zedillo said.
In an interview with five American reporters in the presidential office here overlooking a grove of jacarandas, ablaze with purple blossoms, Mr. Zedillo also vaunted Mexico's economic recovery and said he would express to Mr. Clinton next week his view that only through extended development here can the flow of illegal Mexican migrant workers to the United States eventually be slowed.
"Historically," he said, "it's clear that no matter what you do, as long as there are differences in economic development, then the incentives will be powerful enough that people will go around purely legal barriers."
Most of today's questioning focused on narcotics issues, however, and Mr. Zedillo appeared eager to spell out Mexico's positions in advance. He said he intended to "mention again" Mexico's displeasure with Washington's annual certification process, under which Congress has required the State Department to issue report cards on other nations' anti-narcotics efforts.
"We've been outspoken on certification because we reject the concept," Mr. Zedillo said. "We believe it violates certain principles of international law. This, of course, I will mention to President Clinton again."
Measuring his words, Mr. Zedillo seemed to suggest that if the American Congress ever attempts to impose sanctions on Mexico, he might suspend all drug cooperation. "The moment this process has a consequence in Mexico -- any material or practical consequence -- then we will have to review the whole situation," Mr. Zedillo said.
Mr. Clinton's visit comes at a time when the Mexican economy is growing, and opinion polls show that Mexican workers are beginning to sense improvement. Partly as a consequence, Mr. Zedillo's own popularity is at one of the highest points since his December 1994 inauguration.
In contrast, Mexico-United States relations have soured in recent months, with American lawmakers and others lashing Mexico for pervasive corruption among its drug agents, and Mexicans hitting back with attacks on recently-passed United States immigration laws, seen here as harshly unfair to Mexican migrant workers. "Recent relations have been not too smooth," Mr. Zedillo said.
In this context, he took care to distinguish Mr. Clinton and his statements, which he characterized as friendly to Mexico, from the criticisms of the Mexican Government by American lawmakers and others, which Mr. Zedillo called "noise."
"If any president has been respectful of our domestic life, its been President Clinton," Mr. Zedillo said.
Since 1992, American drug agents operating in Mexico have been prohibited from carrying sidearms, although most of them wink at this rule, with the acquiescence of successive United States ambassadors. But after a series of murders last fall of Mexican officers who had been working with American agents, United States law enforcement officials requested anew that agents here be officially licensed to carry sidearms.
Thomas Constantine, director of the Drug Enforcement Administration, told Congress in February that Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar had told him Mexico "was looking at that and thought they could reach a solution."
Mr. Zedillo's statements today were his first on this issue, and they appeared to close it.
"I've told my people, whatever we can do to cooperate more, lets do it," he said. "But when I'm told that some people in the U.S. Government would like to see their agents armed in Mexico, I say no! The answer is no! No further discussion! Let's look for ways in which those people can be well-protected in Mexico, but we simply will not allow that. And that's that."
A D.E.A. spokesman, asked to respond to Mr. Zedillo's comments, said: "The firearms issue is of concern because of security concerns for D.E.A. agents in Mexico. However, D.E.A. is not currently involved in any ongoing negotiations."
Mexico's anti-drug programs all but collapsed in February, with the discovery that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the anti-drug chief, was on the payroll of the country's major trafficker.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE;
Statements by Clinton and Congressional Leaders on the Agreement

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the statements of President Clinton; Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Speaker Newt Gingrich in announcing the agreement between Democrats and Republicans yesterday on balancing the budget, as provided by the Federal News Service, a private transcription service:
 
President Clinton 
 Good afternoon, everyone. For more than four years now I have worked hard to pursue a strategy that would keep our economy growing and creating opportunity for the American people: giving people the chance to be rewarded for their labors and also imposing upon ourselves the discipline necessary to prepare for the future and to relieve ourselves of a lot of the problems that had been accumulated over the last several years, especially the deficit.
Now we have reached agreement, in broad but fairly specific terms that I am satisfied will do that, with the Republican leaders today, that would balance the budget by 2002, continue to increase our investments in education, in science and technology, in medical research, require us to continue to show great discipline in other areas and to continue to downsize some Government operations.
It would invest in doing what I think is important to be sure that we can move people from welfare to work who are going to be required to go to work. It would expand coverage to millions of children who presently do not have health insurance. It would restore cuts to benefits for legal immigrants who are in this country who have sustained injuries and other problems for which they would otherwise be eligible for benefits. It will extend the life of Medicare and secure the integrity of the Medicaid program between now and 2002. It will be the first balanced budget in three decades.
It's a good thing that it's coming today, when we learn that our unemployment rate had dropped to 4.9 percent for the first time in 24 years.
We know that we have the biggest decline in inequality in our work force since the 1960's, and we've seen our economy produce the largest number of new jobs since 1993 ever produced in a four-year period. That happened because a lot of the people standing up here with me right now had the courage to vote for a plan to bring the deficit down in 1993 and get the interest rates down and investments up.
This agreement will help us to finish the job. I have spoken several times over the last several days with Senator Lott and with Speaker Gingrich. I want to thank them personally for negotiating with me openly, candidly and, I'm convinced, in complete good faith. . . .
Let me give you just some of the details very quickly:
The plan will protect Medicare, extending the life of the trust fund for a decade, extending new benefits for annual mammograms and diabetes screening. Home health will be shifted from Part A to Part B. And there will be a modest premium for home health services, being phased in at $1 per month, a year.
Second, and perhaps most important, this budget meets my goal of making education America's No. 1 priority on the edge of the 21st century. It will have the largest increase in education funding in 30 years. It'll have the largest increase in Pell Grant scholarships in 20 years. It will help us to make sure that every 8-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go into college. I am very, very pleased that it will also include, in the tax-cut portion, aid to help people go on to college and to finance college education.
Third, as I said, it will extend health insurance to five million uninsured children. This is a major breakthrough in our efforts to move toward coverage for all Americans.
Fourth, it will give businesses incentives and work with mayors to hire people from welfare to work. It will also, as I said, address the concerns I raised in last year's law, restoring benefits to disabled legal immigrants and moderating excessive cuts in food stamps, along with giving the states a reserve so that if people would be unjustly cut off food stamps because they simply cannot go to work, the states will be able to avoid malnutrition and real harm to those people in these cases.
Fifth, it will protect the environment, providing funds to clean up 500 of our most dangerous toxic waste sites, cleaning up toxic sites in urban areas and adding resources for environmental enforcement.
Sixth, it includes tax relief for the American people, but -- thanks to the rules of the Senate and the agreement of the leaders -- the tax relief will be limited, and we'll know the dollar amount not only for the first five years, but for the second five years following, so that we will not run the risk of having an explosion in the deficit as a result of unintended leaks in the tax program, so that when we tell the American people we're going to balance the budget, we know we can keep it balanced, and we won't get ourselves back into the difficulties we've seen over the last 15 years. . . .
Everyone will find something that he or she disagrees with. Everyone could find something that he or she wishes were in the budget. There is no perfect agreement. But as I said, we know America is more prosperous when we have fiscal discipline, when we invest in our future, and when we do it in the right way. We have evidence of that.
It'll never get any easier to do this job. Senator Lott made that point to me on the phone the other night. He said, "You know, when you're doing well, it's easier to balance the budget than it is when you're not. This is not going to get any easier. We have to do it now." And I said, "I agree with you, and we are going to do it."
So I ask Americans of all political parties and all philosophies to look at this plan, give it your support. Let's balance the budget and get on about the new business of preparing America for a new century.
Speaker Gingrich
This is a very historic -- and I think for those of us up here a very emotional -- moment. This is a tremendous step forward for all Americans. Intermediate School 125 from the Bronx is visiting the Capitol today. There are many other young people, here in this Rotunda, at this press briefing. Their lives will be better, their economic future will be greater, their chance to earn a living, to have take-home pay, to buy a house will be better because of the agreement, on a bipartisan basis, that we reached today with the President. This is a great moment for our children, our grandchildren and our country. And we are proud to be part of that.

Senator Lott
Last November, when the American people re-elected Republican majorities in both the House of Representatives, while returning President Clinton to the White House, they sent a message to official Washington. The message was clear: Work together to finish the job of balancing the budget and ending the era of big Government. We listened to the American people. We listened to the American people, and the budget agreement we have reached responds to their call.
It is a compromise agreement with the principles of the President and the Congress being incorporated into what we have outlined in this budget agreement. It had to be that way; it had to include Republicans and Democrats in the Congress, House and Senate, and the President. That's the way our Government works.
But it is not a compromise on our principles. On the contrary, it keeps the faith with our children and their children to end the worsening burdens of national debt. It achieves a steady annual reduction in the Federal budget. Year after year, it comes down. And, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in my service in Congress and that of Pete Domenici, who has worked on it for so many years, we will have a guaranteed balanced budget for the American people by the year 2002.
Through this budget, we will reach balance by cutting spending, not by raising taxes, ladies and gentlemen. Under this budget agreement, official Washington must learn to make do with less, while Americans will keep more of what they earn, and they will be able to save it and invest it in their own families. Families with children will finally get that child tax credit that they have been waiting for, so that they can do more on their own for their children. This budget vindicates our long Republican effort to preserve and protect Medicare for current and future generations, for my 83-year-old mother and for our 26-year-old and 29-year-old son.
This budget will foster the kind of enduring economic growth that means more good jobs and more opportunity and more freedom, especially for those who have been on the economic margins of our society. Because of what we do here today, this country can look forward to an era of prosperity, rooted not in the ambition of Government, but in the hopes of individual Americans. Even beyond the impact of lower taxes, which we have in this agreement, the consequences of a balanced budget will be nothing short of revolutionary in individual lives of the American people.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: THE DEMOCRATS;
Despite Angry Colleagues, Clinton Unites His Party

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
On Thursday evening, with a budget deal imminent, Bill Clinton was once again being accused of treason by the liberal wing of his party.
In an angry two-and-a-half-hour session, Democrat after Democrat from the House told the President's chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles, of their many problems with an agreement that they believed would undercut some of their party's basic principles. 
 But less than 24 hours later, Mr. Clinton was able to lance the Democratic anger, with the help of a fiscal bonus from a strong economy that allowed some last-minute additional spending and with Vice President Al Gore pushing particularly hard to address a Medicaid issue that might have left him vulnerable to a Democratic primary challenge.
So Mr. Clinton, surrounded by subdued Senate Democrats who were on a retreat in Baltimore, today somberly announced the five-year deal that he hoped would come into place as the legacy of his second term. "We have reached agreement in broad but fairly specific terms," he said. "It will be the first balanced budget in three decades."
For Mr. Clinton, the moment was a triumph, a bipartisan breakthrough on an issue that has bedeviled Washington for years. He has worked closely with Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, who kept distrustful Republicans at the negotiating table. And in the last two years, Mr. Clinton has pulled the Democratic Party along with him to support the goal of eliminating the deficit, once the province of Republicans.
"I think we've got a good shot of getting a majority of both parties in both houses" to vote for the budget, Mr. Clinton said today, "which has been my goal from day one. And if it happens, America will be much better off." Even Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, who had been expected to lead the liberal charge against the budget plan, said that he was "encouraged at the movement toward addressing Democratic concerns," although he left open the question of how he would vote.
But several Democrats said privately that while Mr. Clinton would most likely get a majority of Democrats in both houses to support the plan, the Democrats' feeling that they had been largely shut out of the negotiating process had left them bruised and mistrustful of Mr. Clinton. The President's advisers predicted that the bad feelings would abate.
As a result of the turmoil, it is as unclear as ever whether Mr. Clinton, the only Democratic President to be re-elected to a second term since President Franklin D. Roosevelt, will succeed in reshaping his party in his own image or whether he will have less sway as he looks toward his legacy and House Democrats look toward the next election, in 1998.
For Mr. Clinton, the agreement to balance the budget culminates a process that began two years ago, after the Republicans seized control of Congress for the first time in more than half a century. In June 1995, with a Presidential election before him and a Republican political strategist counseling him to stand equidistant from the two political parties, President Clinton broke with Congressional Democrats to endorse the Republicans' call for a multiyear plan for a balanced budget.
Having co-opted the Republicans on the issue of fiscal integrity, Mr. Clinton turned the subsequent debate to how to balance the budget -- focusing on protecting traditional Democratic constituencies on Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. The Republicans overplayed their hand in 1995 and tried to push through their own budget plan by twice shutting down the Government. In January 1996, they walked out of the budget talks.
That kept Mr. Clinton from ever having to make a deal that could rupture his party and left Democrats free in 1996 to campaign both on the theme that they wanted to balance the budget and on the refrain that they wanted to "protect" Medicare and Medicaid.
But this year, after Mr. Clinton failed to bring a Democratic Congress into office with him, his interests and those of Congressional Democrats threatened to diverge. Most of the advisers who had once served as Mr. Clinton's ties to Congressional Democrats left at the beginning of his second term, including Leon E. Panetta, the chief of staff who had previously served in the Congress and been the House Democrats' budget negotiator.
He was replaced by Mr. Bowles, a less ideological businessman whom Republicans praised this week as essential to bringing about an agreement even as Democrats sparred with him in closed-door caucuses.
One frustration of the Democrats was Mr. Clinton's decision to negotiate with the Republicans this spring, instead of forcing them to go through the traditional process of drafting and voting first on their own budget plan. With an eye toward next year's Congressional elections, Democrats wanted such a program set out in public so that they could force votes that would show them to be more supportive of popular domestic programs than the Republicans.
But White House officials say Mr. Clinton decided that the time was ripe to negotiate after Republican leaders made conciliatory comments this spring about scaling back the size of the tax cut they wanted and being flexible on an economic assumption.
Mr. Lott said today that the turning point in four months of negotiations had come when Mr. Clinton had become personally involved in the talks several days ago.
By midweek, negotiators had the outlines of a deal that gave Republicans many of the tax reductions they wanted, including cuts in the capital gains tax and the estate tax. The White House had most of the spending it sought for the President's priorities, including for education and for health insurance for children, to mitigate some reductions imposed by the welfare bill Mr. Clinton signed into law last year.
But it was soon clear that this was not enough for many House Democrats, who were incensed by the plan's call for savings in programs for the elderly and the poor at the same time that taxes were being reduced for some of the nation's wealthiest people.
Last night, Mr. Clinton's budget team reconnoitered in Mr. Bowles's office, aware that the White House risked losing a majority of House Democrats and looking to use a windfall caused by the improving economy to bring together more Democratic votes.
Mr. Gore himself, officials said, insisted though his chief of staff, Ronald Klain, that some of the money be used to remove a cap on Medicaid spending that the plan had envisioned.
Billions of dollars more were put into transportation. In consultations with lobbyists for the elderly, they decided to reduce the saving from the Medicare program. And they eliminated any legislative change in the cost-of-living index for Social Security recipients.
As his aides worked, Mr. Clinton personally called half a dozen House Democrats.
This morning, he telephoned Mr. Lott and Speaker Newt Gingrich to say he still was not satisfied that their tax cuts would not balloon after 2002 to reopen the deficit. By midday, he had a promise of a written assurance, and the agreement went forward.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: THE BENEFITS;
Budget Negotiators Soften Impact of Cuts for Elderly

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
The economic windfall that put billions of additional dollars into the budget pot allowed negotiators today to soften the impact of their proposed cutbacks in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
The last-minute revisions went far to assuage the concerns of the elderly, whose lobbyists said tonight that the agreement reached by President Clinton and Congressional Republicans had improved substantially in the last 36 hours and was now more acceptable to them. 
 Among the changes they applauded were the scaling back of an increase in monthly Medicare premiums to $1 from $8, the removal of a cap on Medicaid spending for the poor and the moderation of a proposed change in the Consumer Price Index that would have lowered Social Security and other Government benefit payments.
The budget negotiators said they had softened the effect of their plan on beneficiaries after adopting more optimistic economic assumptions, which produced higher estimates of expected revenues in the coming decade.
Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, which has more than 33 million members, said tonight, "We want to get more details, but it appears that the package improved markedly in the last 36 hours."
Here are some highlights of the budget-balancing agreement, as provided by Congressional leaders and Administration officials:
*Projected spending on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, would be reduced by $115 billion, or 8.5 percent, over the next five years.
*Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, now expected to run out of money in 2001, would remain solvent until 2008.
*The cost of home health care services, which has soared in recent years, would be shifted from the hospital trust fund to a separate Medicare trust fund, which pays doctors' bills. To help cover these costs, Medicare premiums, now $43.80 a month, would be gradually increased over the next five years. But beneficiaries would not have to pay the extra amounts if their family incomes were less than the official poverty level ($9,491 for an elderly couple) or as much as 20 percent above the poverty threshold.
*Projected Federal spending on Medicaid, the health program for low-income people, would be reduced by 3 percent, or $16 billion to $17 billion, over the next five years. Most of the savings would be achieved by cutting special payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of indigent patients.
At the last minute, negotiators dropped their plan to impose firm limits on Federal spending for each Medicaid beneficiary -- a "per capita cap," which would have saved $9 billion from 1998 to 2002. President Clinton had proposed such a cap, but it was vehemently opposed by governors of both parties and by advocates for children and the elderly.
The Federal Government would earmark $15 billion to $17 billion in the next five years for new initiatives to provide health insurance for children. The goal is to provide coverage for five million youngsters, or half of the nation's uninsured children. Budget negotiators did not say whether the money would be used to expand Medicaid, to provide lump-sum grants to the states or to finance some other approach.
Medicare would offer several new preventive health benefits, to help detect diabetes, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Mr. Clinton proposed these benefits, and Speaker Newt Gingrich enthusiastically supported the proposal on diabetes.
Starting in 2000, the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits would be reduced slightly, compared with the amounts that would be paid under current law. Budget negotiators said this change would save perhaps $10 billion to $15 billion from 2000 to 2002. It is justified, they said, because many economists believe that the Consumer Price Index, used as a basis for computing the cost-of-living adjustment, overstates inflation.
House Republicans said the proposal would lower the cost-of-living adjustment by 0.1 to 0.25 of a percentage point -- less than $2 a month for a retired worker receiving the average Social Security benefit of $745 a month. Under the budget agreement, Congress will not legislate a specific cut, but assumes that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will make the appropriate "corrections" in the Consumer Price Index.
Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said it was fortunate that the budget negotiators had dropped the idea of a cap on Medicaid spending because "that proposal wouldn't have flown anyway," given the opposition of governors and health care advocates.
Jose M. Zuniga, a spokesman for the AIDS Action Council, a lobbying group for people with AIDS, said, "We are thrilled that the Medicaid cap has apparently been dropped." But he said, "We are still concerned about the other cuts in Medicaid."

HEADLINE: Donald and Marla Are Headed for Divestiture

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
The moral of this story is that money can't buy happiness.
O.K., maybe that's not the moral. The moral is that great sex does not guarantee enduring love. 
 Well, that's probably not it either. But certainly the lesson to be taken from the news that the marriage of Donald J. Trump and Marla Maples is on the rocks has a great deal more to do with money and sex (not to mention power and fame) than with happiness and love.
Neither Mr. Trump, 50, the real-estate developer fond of having his name emblazoned on his holdings, nor Ms. Maples, 33, a model and sometime actress, chose to speak publicly yesterday -- a veritable news article in itself -- but the future former spouses issued a terse joint statement confirming their decision to separate, which was first reported in The New York Post.
"After a long relationship and a three-and-a-half-year marriage, we have decided to separate, as friends," the statement said.
The friendliness apparently extends to some business arrangements. Ms. Maples, a former beauty pageant contestant from Georgia, is expected to honor her commitment to be the host of the Miss Universe Pageant on May 16, which is to be held in Miami. Mr. Trump, along with CBS, owns the pageant.
The statement went on to make a distinctly uncharacteristic request: that the news media leave them alone. No mention was made of an impending divorce, the possibility of a reconciliation, a prenuptial agreement or the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Tiffany.
Mr. Trump, whose real estate empire includes Atlantic City casinos and New York City properties including the Trump Tower and the brand-new Trump International Hotel and Tower at 1 Central Park West, has a net worth estimated from $450 million, by Forbes magazine, to as much as $2.5 billion.
Mr. Trump is "really married to his business anyway," a person familiar with his portfolio and marital situation said yesterday, adding that the separation was Mr. Trump's idea and that it was happening now for reasons of economics. The prenuptial agreement, the person said, which would pay Ms. Maples $1 million to $5 million in the event of a divorce, is to expire within 11 months, after which she would be entitled to a settlement based on a percentage of Mr. Trump's net worth.
If his net worth is really $2.5 billion, "even if she were to get a small percentage, a small percentage is a lot of money," the person said.
This person, who insisted on anonymity, said Mr. Trump would live at the new building on Central Park West at Columbus Circle, Trump International, and that Ms. Maples would live temporarily at Trump Tower. Eventually, Mr. Trump will buy her a new apartment "in a regular, non-Trump building," the person said, adding that Tiffany "will be taken care of."
No third party is involved, the person said.
Mr. Trump, this person said, "has been forced economically to act."
"It would be a huge mistake to do otherwise. Unless you're married to someone you have 1,000 percent surety in, you just can't do that."
After meeting in 1988, Mr. Trump and Ms. Maples conducted an on-again, off-again, very public affair -- her declaration that sex with him was the best she ever had was only the most memorable headline-grabber -- that hastened the disintegration of Mr. Trump's first marriage.
Many friends of the couple were button-lipped yesterday, but some other acquaintances weren't.
"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the headlines in the paper this morning," said Liz Smith, the gossip columnist, referring to The Post, in which her own column had not a word on the matter. "I saw them at a benefit Wednesday night, and they looked very happy."
Chuck Jones, Ms. Maples's former publicity agent, who was released from prison last fall after his conviction for stealing shoes and undergarments was overturned, sounded a little pleased.
"I brought them together, and I take credit for breaking them apart," Mr. Jones said. "I won't tell you what that means."
Ms. Maples had already given birth to Tiffany when the couple married on Dec. 20, 1993, in a wedding attended by 1,000 people, whose guest list included O. J. Simpson, Howard Stern, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Rosie O'Donnell.
Mr. Stern, not usually known for his prudence, declined, through a spokesman, to comment yesterday, even on the subject of his own prophecy fulfilled.
"It's probably in bad taste, but I give it four months," he had said at the wedding.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hails F.D.R. At Memorial's Opening

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Hailed by President Clinton as "the greatest President of this great American century," Franklin Delano Roosevelt was placed alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln in the nation's political pantheon today with the opening of a sprawling outdoor memorial honoring his leadership during World War II and the Great Depression.
"He electrified the nation, instilling confidence with every tilt of his head and boom of his laugh," Mr. Clinton declared in opening the 7.5-acre memorial devoted to the 32d President, who was chosen four times by American voters in the century's direst era. "His was an open, American spirit, with a fine sense for the possible and a keen appreciation of the art of leadership." 
 Sunshine poured across the Dakota red granite and roaring waterfalls of the $52 million memorial as Mr. Clinton snipped the opening ribbon. The memorial presents an unusual peripatetic approach to the life and times of Roosevelt -- from his signature call for "a rendezvous with destiny," etched now in stone, to the playful bronze statue of his dog Fala.
An hour after the President moved through on crutches, the public burst upon the grounds, searching out inklings and memories. Instantly, ordinary Americans were snapping pictures of themselves grinning alongside sculptured wraiths from the Great Depression.
Some sent the cash register whirring in the new F.D.R. memorabilia shop, buying wartime videos and enlistment posters, even before the first tableau about hardscrabble America could be reached. Others paused to wonder at a graceful statue of Eleanor Roosevelt, the first First Lady to be so honored in a national memorial. In one of the fine-tunings in the final rush to opening, her statue, hailing her as the first United States delegate to the United Nations, had to be minutely reset so that she leaned closer to the people.
"I planted trees for Roosevelt in the C.C.C.," said 79-year-old Francis E. Stueve, spry and exuberant amid the tourist buzz as he recalled the Civilian Conservation Corps. "I was at Pearl Harbor when the Japs attacked -- strafed the butter dish right off the mess hall table. Roosevelt deserves every bit of this."
War and hard times seemed a world apart on the breezy, brilliant day that saw several thousand guests and tourists gather for the opening, including Roosevelt's goddaughter, Princess Margriet of The Netherlands. Recalling Roosevelt's pride in his Dutch ancestry, the Princess presented bouquets of a new orange-toned rose named for him.
Despite Roosevelt's stated preference for a simple desk-sized memorial slab, which was placed outside the National Archives after his death in 1945, a determined, bipartisan memorial drive saw its effort realized today after a 42-year campaign. It included three design competitions, numerous delays, and $10 million in donations from the public, about a fifth of the cost.
"The America he built was a memorial all around us, from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Grand Coulee Dam; from Social Security to honest financial markets," Mr. Clinton declared of why the project never seemed particularly urgent across the last half-century.
The memorial, described by its designer Lawrence Halprin as a "walking environmental experience," overlooks the Tidal Basin, where the cherry blossoms bloom, and the east bank of the Potomac, with its vista of Arlington National Cemetery. The memorial is a mix of Depression and wartime images amid gentle outdoor scenes. The granite setting is laced with Roosevelt quotations, but David Roosevelt, the President's grandson, said the effect was to honor "not a man but an era in this nation's history."
Roosevelt is depicted grandly surveying the nation, seated and caped, war-weary but determined in a larger-than-life-sized statue.
"He did a good job," said Herman Cohen, an 82-year-old war veteran from Brooklyn, who savored his Commander in Chief's monumental place in the nation's history.
Among the early visitors was a group of disabled who celebrated the fact that President Clinton and others have begun calling for a clearer depiction of Roosevelt as wheelchair-bound. They were particularly curious about a replica of a wheelchair, cleverly designed by Roosevelt from a plain kitchen chair. It was on display in the gift shop, but not as a permanent part of the memorial.
President Clinton, reviewing Roosevelt's accomplishments, cited the latest unemployment figures to make the comparison that while 1 in 4 Americans was out of work in 1932, fewer than 1 in 20 is now.
"It is a strange irony of our time that, here at the moment of our greatest prosperity and progress in so many years," Mr. Clinton continued, "at this time where the pinnacle that Roosevelt hoped America would achieve, and our influence and power has come to pass, we still strangely fight battles with doubts, doubts that he would treat with great impatience and disdain."
Mr. Clinton, who has been criticized by some for ending the Federal welfare program for children that Roosevelt began, made no direct allusion to his own record. But he said, "The great legacy of Roosevelt is a vision and a challenge, not a set of specific programs but a set of commitments -- the duty we owe to ourselves, to one another, to our beloved nation, and increasingly to our fellow travelers on this small planet."
The President celebrated "F.D.R.'s famous flexibility of mind," and slapped the podium for emphasis in recalling how Roosevelt would not tolerate doubts.
"I ask you to remember what he was writing at Warm Springs when he died, that last speech," Mr. Clinton said. He then quoted Roosevelt's parting advice to the nation: "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith."

The Mantra For 1997: It's the Best Of Times

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
When it comes to economic news, it does not get much better than this.
Unemployment, the Government concluded today, fell below 5 percent for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century. Economic growth in the first quarter of the year, at 5.6 percent, was nearly double the predictions. 
 And in striking the broad outlines of a budget deal, Democrats and Republicans engaged in the kind of budget negotiation no one could have anticipated a year ago: haggling over what to do with an unexpected surge in Government revenues that, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate that raced around Capitol Hill this morning, could bring an extra $200 billion to the Treasury over the next five years. (In minutes, they found several things to do with it.)
Spurred on by the dedication today of the Franklin D. Roosevelt memorial on the Mall, people in Washington even began talking in overarching terms about today's economy as the fulfillment of a grander vision.
"If we were in 1945 now on the day F.D.R. died," Michael Beschloss, the historian, said today, "and we tried to imagine the best scenario for a half-century later, this would be it: unemployment this low and a country that is at the center of an interdependent world economy."
Herbert Stein, the chairman of the council of economic advisers in the Nixon Administration, said today, "I remember when we held a press conference around this time in 1972 and I said what we had was the best combination of economic numbers in history -- and then I amended that to say I meant the Christian era of history." But the numbers then, he added, were reached somewhat artificially, with the benefit of price controls. "I think the numbers are even better now," he added, "because they are purer."
But good economic news always has a way of making people nervous, and this time is no exception.
The political impact of prosperity has been clear here this week. It has forestalled some truly difficult political choices as the White House and Congressional leaders raced to put together the budget package.
With the extra $200 billion in hand (the fact that it was a projection, and a rough one at that, was considered a small detail), both parties were able to sidestep a politically unpopular recalculation of the rate of inflation, a recalculation that would effectively lower the increases for Social Security recipients and other beneficiaries of entitlement programs. Most of the evidence suggests that the current inflation rate is significantly overstated.
But the political reality is that the good times helped Washington avoid a face-off with the politically powerful groups that represent the elderly, led by the American Association of Retired Persons.
The longer-term risks of celebrating good times, though, are harder to measure.
Countries have a way of convincing themselves that they have found the magic formula, to the point of ignoring disturbing signals of trouble -- Japan in the late 1980's comes to mind.
Markets have the same tendency. The Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, never stops reminding his aides that Wall Street traders -- he once was one -- move from extremes of optimism to extremes of pessimism even faster than politicians do. Every new sign of economic expansion, profit growth and budget peace only fuels what Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, termed "irrational exuberance" -- because the news makes exuberance seem a lot more rational.
And perhaps it is more rational. "Looking at the last 20 or 25 years, what has recently been going on is one hell of a lot better -- well significantly better -- than virtually anybody thought possible," said Charles L. Schultze, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers in the inflation-ridden days of the Carter Administration.
"If you had told me and 90 percent of my colleagues just three of four years ago that you could push the unemployment rate down to below 5 percent, and inflation would have for all practical purposes no uptick, we would have said that you are just plain wrong," he said.
Mr. Schultze has identified only one of several recent economic guesses that have turned wrong.
The Treasury and the Congressional Budget Office were not even close in predicting the kind of revenue that has flowed into Washington, the logical consequence of economic growth rates that were also underestimated. Of course, that is the kind of mistake everyone likes to discover. "The scary part," said one Treasury official early this week, "is that if you can't make good guesses six months out, what does that say about our ability to project a balanced budget five years out?"
Naturally, all this good news leads to the natural question: Can it last?
Perhaps the better way to put that question is whether the Federal Reserve will let it last, or whether Mr. Greenspan thinks the heat will come out of the economy of its own accord.
The conventional wisdom, naturally, is that the decline in the unemployment rate will force the Fed's hand when it meets on May 20, even without evidence of inflation.
Nonetheless, the bond markets, perhaps looking to the long term, decided this afternoon that maybe a budget deal was not such a bad idea after all. Worries about the Fed were put aside, and interest rates dropped after the news flashed across screens around the world.
That was exactly the reassuring vote of confidence the White House was looking for, whether the deal President Clinton announced was the best to be had or not.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE HITS 23-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
America's unemployment rate dropped in April below 5 percent, a level not seen since December 1973, when Richard M. Nixon was President, the Government reported today.
A startling three-tenths of a point decline in the jobless rate pushed it down to 4.9 percent, as factories recorded a new peak in overtime hours and the economy continued to advance at a healthy pace. While there were signs that the rapid economic growth of recent months was slowing, the evidence of further gains on the job front convinced many economists that the Federal Reserve remained on track to raise interest rates at least one more time, probably at its next meeting on May 20. 
 "Our economy is now the strongest it's been in a generation," President Clinton said, reflecting his view not only of the dazzling labor market but also of Wednesday's report that the first three months of this year posted the fastest growth, a 5.6 percent annual pace, since 1987. Indeed, several experts said the United States was enjoying a rare combination of low unemployment and low inflation not regularly experienced since the 1960's.
Instead of being frightened that the tight labor market would bring severe anti-inflation measures by the Federal Reserve, financial markets took today's report in stride. And with the help of the agreement between the White House and Congressional leaders to balance the budget, the stock market closed with strong gains that capped one of the most spectacular weeks on Wall Street in years. The Dow Jones industrial average closed today at 7,071.20 -- within just 14 points of its record high -- and the Nasdaq composite index of mostly technology-oriented smaller stocks posted even better gains.
As the first broad gauge of the economy's performance last month, today's labor market report was eagerly anticipated by analysts. Payrolls grew by a moderate 142,000 and average hourly earnings actually edged down slightly after two hefty increases.
"We are well within that lucky range where workers are receiving well-deserved real wage increases but there are still no signs of inflationary pressures," Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.
Private analysts expressed relief at the various relatively soft spots in the Labor Department's report, including the fact that about half the improvement in the jobless rate came from a decline in the work force.
"I think the economy is now slowing of its own accord," said Martin Regalia, economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. He said the Federal Reserve could probably not ignore such a low unemployment rate and would raise rates again this month but could then stop tightening monetary policy.
The decline in the unemployment rate to under 5 percent -- not seen since around the time of the first Arab oil embargo -- was something that tens of millions of workers in their 30's and early 40's had never experienced.
The jobless ranks dwindled by 430,000, benefiting all major demographic groups, but especially adult women and blacks. Regionally, the improvement was concentrated in the South and West. For women, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.4 percent from 4.7 percent and for blacks the rate eased to 9.8 percent from 10.7 percent.
The low jobless rate presented a still greater challenge to the many economists who had long contended that inflation would begin to accelerate if unemployment fell much below 6 percent, a condition that has now prevailed for more than two years.
Average hourly earnings, a fairly erratic measure, eased 1 cent in April after increases totaling 11 cents in the first three months of the year.
The tight job market also seemed likely to aid the nation's effort under the new welfare law to move recipients into paid jobs.
"If you can't do welfare-to-work at 4.9 percent, when in the world would you do it?" asked Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, a voice of small companies. He said that dire job loss predicted by conservatives and many of his own members as a result of raising the minimum wage last autumn did not occur because of tax breaks and other benefits enacted at the same time.
The Labor Department's survey of households, on which the jobless rate is based, showed a job gain of 209,000 -- a solid number but down sharply from the spectacular gain of 745,000 in March. The jobless rate shrank as well because of a rare recent decline in the labor force of 221,000.
Typically, a rapidly expanding economy pulls back into the work force many less skilled or less motivated people who might have dropped out but who now see renewed job prospects. Today's results hinted that this pool might finally be drying up after a long spell of buoyant labor force growth.
The report also showed a drop of nearly 300,000 in the category of the newly jobless, those out of work less than five weeks, and a further 29,000 decline in those idled for more than six months.
The department's survey of employers, meanwhile, showed a second consecutive month of subdued payroll growth. The 142,000 increase was not only less than expected but it was also calculated after a downward revision that cut the March gain by 36,000, to 139,000.
Put another way, payrolls expanded less than half as fast in March and April, taken together, as in January and February. But analysts noted unusual weather patterns this year that defied accurate adjustment for seasonal variation.
Construction jobs, for example, benefited from warm February weather but suffered from subsequent bad weather and contributed to a decline of 44,000 jobs in April. Last month, health services and engineering and management services added 34,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively, while all major components of the finance, insurance and real estate category contributed to a total gain of 23,000.
On the other hand, factory jobs eased 14,000 despite five hours of weekly overtime for those working. That was the greatest amount of overtime since the Government began tracking it in 1956. The lost jobs were mostly in the motor vehicle industry, where there was a strike involving 3,500 workers as well as some temporary plant shutdowns to control inventories.
Over all, the workweek for the private sector contracted by 18 minutes, the report also showed, contributing to a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 139.6, in the index of aggregate weekly hours.
Another sign of economic slackening, analysts said, was a third consecutive monthly decline in the proportion of industries adding jobs, now 54.2 percent, down from a recent peak of 63.1 percent in October.
The Northeast and Midwest had virtually unchanged jobless rates last month of 5.4 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively, while the rate dropped seven-tenths of a point in the South, to 4.7 percent, and three-tenths of a point in the West, to 5.7 percent.

Budget Deal Is Reached, With Help of Windfall
The Clinton Administration reached agreement with the Republican leadership on a plan to balance the Federal budget in five years, using a last-minute financial windfall from a strong economy to help forge a deal that could alter the nation's economic and political landscape. 1
 
Less than 24 hours after the liberal wing of his party was once again accusing him of treason, President Clinton was able to lance the Democratic anger, with the help of the fiscal bonus that allowed some last-minute additional spending. 13
 
Assuaging Budget Concerns
Lobbyists for the elderly applauded some of the last-minute revisions in the budget plan. Among them were the scaling back of an increase in monthly Medicare premiums to $1 from $8, the removal of a cap on Medicaid spending for the poor and the moderation of a proposed change in the Consumer Price Index that would have lowered Social Security and other Government benefit payments. 12

After one day on the job, the interim manager of the Brookhaven National Laboratory said he was confident that the public drinking water around the laboratory was safe, even though the lab has leaked radioactive water for years, and he praised the lab as "one of the premier research facilities in the country." 26
 
Officers Cleared in Killing
A Brooklyn grand jury has cleared two police officers in the killing of an unarmed man whom they shot after he entered a stolen car they had under surveillance in East Flatbush, prosecutors said. The officers said they had opened fire because they thought that the man, Aswan Watson, 23, was reaching for a gun. When the car was searched, all that was found was an anti-theft device called the Club. The killing, in June 1996, caused two days of street demonstrations. 25
 
Painting's Ownership Disputed
A judge ruled that a painting that a Cornell University professor had sought to sell through Sotheby's could not be sold until its rightful owner was established. A Polish prince contends that the painting, possibly 400 years old and listed by Sotheby's as "Portrait of a Lady, Presumably Anne of Bretagne," had been in his family's art collection until it was stolen by the Nazis during World War II. 27

Clinton and Republicans Agree to Balance Budget
The Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership agreed to balance the Federal budget in five years. Facilitating the deal, which could alter the nation's economic and political landscape, was a decision by the Congressional Budget Office to slash its deficit estimates for coming years. 
 Both sides claimed victory. President Clinton cited new spending for education, health insurance for children, welfare benefits and other programs, while basically protecting Medicare. Republicans gained a big tax cut, including a reduction in the capital gains tax, and were successful in scaling back overall domestic spending. [Page 1.]
 
Jobless Rate Tumbled to 4.9%
The nation's unemployment rate dropped a startling three-tenths of a point in April to 4.9 percent, a level not seen since 1973, as factories recorded a new peak in overtime hours. Payrolls grew by a moderate 142,000, and average hourly earnings edged down slightly after two hefty increases, showing an absence of inflationary pressure. [1.]
 
Bulls Sweep Treasury Markets
The bulls made a clean sweep in the Treasury markets this week, with prices rising and yields falling as data suggested the economy was not advancing too rapidly. The 30-year bond rose 16/32 yesterday, to 9629/32 , yielding 6.88 percent, down more than a quarter of a percentage point, for the week. [40.]
 
GPU Considers Sale of Nuclear Unit
One of the two units of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the site of the nation's worst nuclear accident, may be put up for sale, the owner, GPU Inc., said. The unit that had the accident, which led to a partial meltdown on March 28, 1979, was permanently shut down. The adjacent unit -- the one to be sold -- has been operating steadily and has received good performance ratings by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. [39.]
 
G.M. Cuts Electric Car Leases
Seeking to get more of its limited-range electric cars on the road, General Motors lowered the lease rates for the vehicle, the EV1, which was introduced in Southern California and Arizona in December, by 25 percent -- still $399 to $549 a month -- and agreed to help pay for quick construction of 50 public charging stations. [38.]
 
Boeing Accused on Defective Parts
The Justice Department accused Boeing of knowingly allowing defective parts to be installed in hundreds of Chinook military helicopters, two of which crashed. Boeing denied the accusation. [38.]
 
Arguments Made in Tobacco Case
In an overflowing Florida courtroom, lawyers for both plaintiffs and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco presented five hours of closing arguments in a wrongful-death trial that is being watched closely on Wall Street. [8.]
 
Tiny Fractions for Big Board Stocks
Prices on the New York Stock Exchange, where stocks have been traded in increments of 1/8 of a dollar -- 12.5 cents -- for the Big Board's entire history, began trading in half-sized increments -- 1/16 , or 6.25 cents. There were even some trades at 1/32 , or increments of 3.125 cents. Two third-market firms instituted the change; prices on the floor must still be quoted in eighths. [38.]
 
Dollar Rallies Against Yen and Mark
The dollar rallied after a Swiss central banker said he was not concerned about the currency's strength, and the Labor Department reported a plunge in unemployment. In New York, the dollar settled at 126.57 yen, up from 126.51 yen on Thursday and at 1.7293 marks, up from 1.7217. [36.]
 
Gasoline Futures Prices Tumble
Gasoline futures prices tumbled on signs that production and imports were keeping supplies ample in the United States. On other markets, soybeans rose. [36.]
 
Brazilian Sale Seen, Despite Delay
Despite this week's unexpected court-ordered delay in the Brazilian Government's sale of shares in its state-owned mining company, billed as the largest privatization ever undertaken in Latin America, most analysts expect the sale to take place ultimately. The question is when. News Analysis. [4.]

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: NEWS ANALYSIS;
The Giving And Taking

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
As a political matter, the budget-balancing accord announced today was a substantial accomplishment for a Democratic President and a Republican-led Congress.
The President accepted the Republican principles of tax cuts for the rich and the middle class and abandoned the Democratic theme of protecting Medicare from cuts at all costs. In return, he got some extra money he wanted for education and welfare. 
 Republicans got their tax cuts for families and investors and some savings in domestic programs. But they dropped the plans they had in 1995 and 1996 for crippling Medicare and Medicaid, abolishing Government departments and agencies, expanding the military and relaxing environmental protections.
So the accord claims enough of the middle ground that it may actually hold up over the years. But history shows that budget deals are always tenuous, partly because the rank and file does not participate in the negotiations and thus cannot be counted on for the painful votes to come, and partly because times change so much over a few years that commitments cannot be kept.
The agreement struck today is, after all, only a skeleton. Later this year, the politicians must face questions of flesh and blood. Will Republicans really vote for bills this year that appropriate much more money than they want to spend for education and the arts? Will Democrats vote to abolish taxes on million-dollar inheritances and to lower taxes on capital gains when three-quarters of the taxes on investment profits go to taxpayers with annual incomes of more than $200,000? Will the President who blasted Republicans mercilessly during last year's election campaign for wanting to cut Medicare now spend the rest of the year rounding up votes for lower Medicare payments and higher premiums?
It is much easier to talk generally about such matters, as was done today, than it is to vote on them specifically.
"Keep in mind," President Clinton cautioned in Baltimore this afternoon, "this is an agreement. It still must be embodied in law."
Further, experience shows how politically risky it is for a President to work around lawmakers from his own party and strike a deal with the opposition party.
That is what happened in 1990, the only other time a President has negotiated a budget deal behind closed doors with leaders of the opposition. Then, President George Bush agreed with the Democratic Congress to raise taxes.
He never recovered from the perception that he had forsaken the bedrock Republican principle of no new taxes. That was an important element in his election defeat two years later.
Of course, Mr. Clinton is not running for re-election the way Mr. Bush was. But he does have more than three and a half years left in his term. The Republicans conducting the Congressional hearings this summer on campaign finance practices will almost certainly not cut him any slack because he worked with them on the budget. But Democrats on whom the President must rely for support at those hearings may still have their noses out of joint because of the way they were more or less locked out of budget deliberations.
The most important history lesson may be that five-year promises are hard to keep. Politicians have often pledged frugality one year and then reneged in later years when the belt-tightening really began to pinch.
Ever since 1978, when legislation was approved stating that spending "shall not exceed" receipts, one law after another has been enacted promising a balanced budget. And every one so far has been abandoned when the time came for actual families and companies and interest groups to pay higher taxes or give up Government services.
This time, as President Clinton said today, "the growth in the economy made it easier than it would otherwise have been."
Indeed, the strong economy led to tax receipts in April so much larger than expected that the deficit this year is now forecast to be just $75 billion, only 60 percent as large as the Government projected just three months ago when Mr. Clinton's budget was published.
That leads to this caution: The budget agreement is predicated on the idea that the economy will not falter in the next five years. But good times cannot last forever.
Since economists began keeping reasonably reliable records after the Civil War, the longest period without a recession in the United States has been 8 years and 10 months -- from February 1961 until December 1969. The economy has now been expanding for 6 years and 2 months, since March 1991. If it continues to grow steadily until October 2002, the period covered by the budget agreement, the economy will have gone without a recession for more than three years longer than has ever happened before.
Maybe that will occur. But just Thursday night, the budget negotiators learned that they had $200 billion more than anticipated because of re-estimates by the Congressional Budget Office that took account of the unusually strong economy.
If small, unexpected changes for the good can lead to that much more revenue, then imagine the damage that big changes for the bad, like a recession, can do. If the economy turns sour -- or even if growth is just a percentage point or two lower than expected -- today's agreement will not lead to a balanced budget.
And here is another caution: politicians have the propensity to put off the hard choices. That gives them the option of changing their minds.
In the five-year budget plan Mr. Clinton submitted to Congress in February, 75 percent of the deficit reduction was scheduled for the last two years. That would have allowed many of the spending cuts to be set aside if they became too painful.
Neither the White House nor the Congressional committees would reveal today how much bitter medicine in their agreement had been put off until the later years. The final calculations have not been made, officials at both ends of town said.
But this bears watching next week. In any deal, savings will appear larger in the later years because of annual compounding. But if the final numbers show that more than 60 percent or 65 percent of the savings are to occur in 2001 and 2002, then the credibility of the entire arrangement will be subject to question.

HEADLINE: Question After Hong Kong: Is Taiwan Next for Beijing?

SERIES: WAITING FOR CHINA: Jitters in Taiwan

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan

 BODY:
As champions of the Taiwan independence movement, Wesley J. D. Yu and his family have built a political dynasty in this seaport city, where harbor cranes soar above a horizon of cargo containers stacked along a vast waterfront. It is a vista that evokes the economic vibrancy of this island off China's southeastern coast.
But these days Mr. Yu, a provincial assemblyman, also speaks with surprising frankness about the possibility that Taiwan might some day reunite with its longtime enemy China -- especially after Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty on July 1. 
 "Just as the United States is a confederation of states, maybe we could be confederated with mainland China," he said recently, striding across the broad concrete pier of Kaohsiung port where cargo ships were hoisting their loads.
"We have to be more realistic, and not just talk in theories," he continued, ticking off the conditions that would have to be fulfilled. "We want our own military, our own foreign policy and our own officials. We have to have our dignity and our security. And China has to give us a promise that they will not use force to reunify. They have to change their policy, and then maybe we could reunite."
Mr. Yu spoke like a man sure of his terms, but who also knew that the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule would start a clock ticking, counting down to a political reckoning for the 21 million people of Taiwan, who are asking: Are we next?
Nearly five decades after Taiwan became the exile home of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government, the end of colonial rule in Hong Kong this year, and in Macao in 1999, has reawakened the prospect that Beijing may soon set a deadline for union with Taiwan.
This long-deferred question has suddenly become one of Asia's major security concerns.
For the people of Taiwan, but also for the United States, whether the island's fate is settled through peaceful negotiation or under the threat of force from Beijing will help determine the level of Asian instability in the future. And as was demonstrated little more than a year ago when missiles were fired toward Taiwan from the mainland, it could draw the United States into a direct confrontation with China.
As the weeks count down for the people of Hong Kong, there is no keener audience watching every step of Beijing's management of the transition than the one here.
"In Hong Kong, they have no choice but to accept their fate, but Taiwan is different," said Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, of which Mr. Yu and his family are prominent members.
"However, we believe Chinese pressure on Taiwan is going to become greater and greater, and all the people in Taiwan are really worried."
Taiwan today is an island of contradictions. Politically, the supremacy of the governing Nationalist Party, long committed to reunification with the mainland, is being undermined by a growing independence movement. President Lee Teng-hui, the first native Taiwanese to lead the party, has more closely allied himself with separatist voters as a way to straddle the island's politics.
And economically, an army of Taiwan business executives is investing on the mainland despite Government efforts to curb the two societies' growing interdependence.
 
American Military Pulled Out in 1979
When the Communists chased their army into the sea at the end of the 1945-49 civil war, the exiled Nationalists used dictatorial rule to turn this mountainous island into their fortress. Their efforts were backed by an American security guarantee that included basing tactical nuclear weapons here in the 1950's.
But in 1979, the American military left as Washington switched its diplomatic recognition to Beijing and adopted a Taiwan policy of "unofficial" relations and low-key military assistance to insure the island's defense.
In the last decade, Taiwan has evolved into a thriving democracy and an economic powerhouse very much in charge of its own destiny. Taiwan today, modern and free, seems a nation in everything but name.
Just south of the port at Kaohsiung lies a sprawling oil refinery that supplies 80 percent of the gasoline in Taiwan, which has among the world's highest densities of automobiles.
"If mainland China fired one of these new missiles into that refinery, the whole island could come to a standstill," said Wang Chien-shien, a respected political figure who quit the Nationalist Party after 36 years to help form the New Party, dedicated to clean government and eventual reunification with the mainland.
Last year China held belligerent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait and fired missiles to target zones just off Kaohsiung and Keelung, Taiwan's main ports. That prompted Washington to send two aircraft carrier battle groups in a show of American resolve to preserve the peace.
The region remains jittery after the crisis of 1995-96, set off when President Clinton granted President Lee a visa to visit the United States, an act Beijing believed was intended to encourage the pro-independence bent that Mr. Lee has indulged.
 
The Old Policy Was Just to Wait
Since 1972, when President Nixon began the process of re-establishing relations with Beijing, the question of Taiwan has been deliberately deferred. The strategic readjustment that downgraded Taiwan's status in the world was founded on the expectation that, in time, the two societies would be drawn back together.
Today, the concept of "one China" and the policy of deferral are under challenge. The tide of the pro-independence movement, now supported by a quarter to a third of Taiwan's electorate, is so strong that it threatens to overtake a majority of the island's municipal governments in elections this year and wrest control of the national legislature from the Nationalists by 2000.
To hold on to power, President Lee has courted the pro-independence faction to the point that many members of his own party doubt his commitment to reunification, and defections from Mr. Lee's party are now legion.
"I think in President Lee's mind he supports Taiwan independence," Mr. Yu said. "But he cannot say it; he can only act on it."
 
If Independence Gains, Will Beijing Act?
The danger in the next one to two years, Mr. Wang says, is that as Taiwan's internal politics continues to drift toward a pro-independence majority, Beijing's rulers will feel the pressure to act.
"If the independence party has a big win, what is China to think other than Taiwan is going for independence?" Mr. Wang asked. "China will say, 'We cannot wait anymore; we have to do what we have to do.' "
When Deng Xiaoping, then China's senior leader, crafted the "one country, two systems" guarantee for Hong Kong, his goal was to reassure the British Government and the colony's residents that they could maintain everything they had worked for even as China's red flag was hoisted over the territory.
Now, Deng's heir, President Jiang Zemin, is offering the same deal to the people of Taiwan, who seem less willing to buy it. Mr. Jiang has pledged, as Deng did, that Taiwan could keep and maintain a separate military, and he has suggested that one or more Taiwan leaders could come to Beijing to serve in top positions, including the Chinese vice presidency.
That proposal was met with deep skepticism, both by the Government and other political parties.
"It didn't excite people here," said Alice Kao, a prominent New Party legislator.
"Hong Kong is a colony; it is not a sovereign state," said Chao Jen-ho, a former special assistant to President Lee and now secretary general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation. The foundation was the vehicle Taiwan used to open the first political dialogue with the mainland in 1993, only to see that dialogue shut down by Beijing in retaliation for Mr. Lee's visit to the United States in 1995.
There is now a flood of investment on the mainland by entrepreneurs from Taiwan. Thousands of companies have plowed more than $20 billion in investment into businesses on the mainland, often sending their money through bank accounts in the Cayman Islands or other offshore money havens to evade Government detection.
The economic integration between Taiwan and the mainland is the same kind of bonding that has connected Hong Kong and mainland Chinese industrialists, creating a common interest that will provide a force for stability after July 1.
Many economists argue that Taiwan investment on the mainland, together with investment from Japan and the West, creates pressure on China to open its markets further and to establish the rule of law. Taiwan, they point out, may soon enter the World Trade Organization and cannot hope to exclude mainland China from its market it if does so.
The most aggressive of Taiwanese investors may be Wang Yong-ching, 82, chairman of Taiwan Plastics. Earlier this year, he announced that he was going ahead with plans to invest $3 billion in a power plant in Fujian, the Chinese province that faces Taiwan across the strait and whose people speak a common dialect with the Taiwanese.
Not only did the island's pro-independence forces attack Mr. Wang's investment plan as playing into Beijing's strategy of offering "economic enticements," but President Lee also invoked national interests in forbidding the venture.
"Our policy is still to discourage businesses from going," said Su Qi, the Government spokesman in Taipei. "We are now trying to hold back the biggies like Taiwan Plastics, and we have put our foot down."
In public, Mr. Wang has acquiesced, but his associates say he is secretly going forward, channeling his funds through offshore subsidiaries because he believes that investment on the mainland is the best way to connect Taiwan with the global economy.
"He says he is an older man than President Lee, and he has not time to play these games," a close associate said. Mr. Lee is 75.
 
Waiting for Congress Of Communist Party
In the interregnum between Hong Kong's assimilation and whatever awaits Taiwan, the people, the Government and the military seem to be preparing for the next crisis.
One important milestone will be the 15th Communist Party Congress, which convenes this fall. If President Jiang is affirmed as Deng's clear successor, he may also emerge with a mandate to make a new offer -- or demand -- to Taiwan. "People are very conservative about making any predictions before the 15th Party Congress," said Ms. Kao of the New Party.
Meanwhile, Mr. Lee is strengthening his hand to respond to whatever challenge the mainland hands him. Next month, a constitutional convention will enhance his powers, giving him the right to dissolve Parliament in a crisis.
And Taiwan's military is rapidly adding high-technology weapons to its arsenal.
Ordinary Taiwanese seem to regard the whole drama with cynicism or indifference, a mask for their deeper concerns.
"People here feel like they have been walking on a tightrope for two to three years now," said Andrew Yang, whose research organization analyzes relations between Taiwan and the mainland. "So they are already up there, practicing their balance all the time with great risk. They are working without a net."
"But the effect is that practice increases your confidence in your skill," he added.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: THE CALCULATIONS;
The Negotiators Forgo A Cut in Inflation Index

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Congress and the Clinton Administration backed down yesterday, declining to impose on the nation an outsized reduction in the Consumer Price Index as part of their budget agreement. Instead, they decided simply to accept a future change expected to be made in the index, the nation's best-known inflation measure, by the statisticians and the economists who calculate it.
Some of the nation's most powerful figures, including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had embraced the view that the index overstates inflation by more than a percentage point. 
 A reduction by that amount would have eliminated billions of dollars in Federal outlays tied to the index, thus easing the task of reaching the budget agreement.
But the negotiators for the two sides decided not to legislate any change in the index, an option they had considered until yesterday. Rather, the economic assumptions incorporated in their agreement anticipate a small cut in the index, in keeping with a change the technicians are likely to make anyway.
"My reaction is that any step in the right direction is a good thing, but there is still a lot of bias left in the C.P.I.," said Michael J. Boskin, a Stanford University economist who headed a commission, appointed by the Senate Finance Committee, that had recommended a big adjustment, arguing that the index overstated inflation by 1.1 percentage points.
Mr. Boskin's hope had been that the nation's economists would publicly endorse the findings of his panel, itself made up of five prominent economists. That would have greatly helped Congress and the Administration to make downward adjustments in Social Security benefits and other Federal outlays pegged to the index, since they could have argued that they were doing so for technical reasons and not largely for the sake of cost-saving expediency.
But the consensus of economists in support of the Boskin commission's findings never materialized. And the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the index each month, said that while it agreed with the commission in principle, a number of the panel's findings documenting its conclusion were empirically unsound.
In the end, negotiators for Congress and the Administration found ways to come up with a balanced-budget agreement without having to embrace the commission's politically touchy recommendation, which was staunchly opposed by powerful lobbying groups like the American Association of Retired Persons.
"There was considerable uneasiness among Democrats and some Republicans about a legislated C.P.I. change," said one Democratic Congressional aide.
The Boskin commission had argued, in effect, that value judgments were a necessary tool in calculating the index. It said the Bureau of Labor Statistics failed to take quality improvements of products sufficiently into account and also failed to allow for the "substitution effect."
The commission reasoned that if a motorist, for example, pays an extra two cents a gallon for gasoline at a self-service pump that accepts the motorist's credit card for payment, that two cents pays for a quality improvement: the convenience of paying by credit card. The two cents therefore should not be counted as inflation, the commission held, the sort of conclusion the bureau challenged as statistically difficult to defend.
The commission also noted, correctly, that the bureau failed to allow for substitution. If romaine lettuce, for example, rises in price while iceberg lettuce does not, then people buy more iceberg and less romaine to acquire enough lettuce at roughly the same cost. The bureau currently notes in its calculation of the index only the price increase for romaine, not the shift in purchases to buy enough lettuce without spending more.
The bureau is experimenting now with a mathematical formula designed to estimate this substitution effect, going forward with the research although a few economists argue that the formula is itself a flawed concept. The outcome of the research is to be announced late this year, and, if it yields results, they will be incorporated into the calculation of the index in early 1999.
Hewing to this schedule, the budget negotiators incorporated into their economic estimates the effects on Government spending of a 0.15-percentage-point reduction in the index starting in 1999, guessing that this will be the adjustment the bureau actually makes in January or February of that year.
"That is their estimate, not ours," said Brent Moulton, the bureau official heading the research. "The only estimate we have given is zero to 0.25, and we don't have any more precise estimate at this point."
The shift from romaine to less expensive iceberg lettuce is called substitution within a single category. The bureau has also gathered data on another recommendation of the Boskin commission, to allow for shifts across categories: when the price of beef rises, for instance, consumers buy less beef and greater quantities of less expensive chicken or fish, to maintain the same standard of living without spending more.
But bureau officials say that accommodating for shifts across categories would be a lot harder to incorporate in the index on a month-to-month basis.
The political stakes in this dispute are great, of course. Various Federal and state subsidies for the poor, as well as pensions for retirees, rise in tandem with the Consumer Price Index, which is also used to adjust tax brackets.
But there is another process in play that is also sensitive: the gradual shift in the index from a measure of price changes to a measure of how much additional money a person or household must spend to maintain a given standard of living.
That involves value judgments that the Boskin commission and some politicians are more willing to embrace than are the bureau and other experts.
Further, the commission found itself criticized for failing to incorporate quality deterioration that adds to the cost of living -- the cost of security devices, for example, to protect a home against rising crime.

From Welfare To Workfare, A Dead End

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
BEFORE Yolanda De Jesus got her workfare assignment recently, she had high hopes for her high-tech background. Maybe she would get a chance to use the computer skills she had learned in school or the managerial experience from her last job at an office machine company.
She wound up sweeping trash in a housing project. 
 "I have skills that take me higher," she said. "But that's all they had to offer."
She fashioned her own version of welfare reform. She left the trash patrol after one day and enrolled in a computer class offered by the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, or Sobro. She's gambling that she will have learned enough new skills to land a job before the welfare office cuts her benefits because she refused her workfare assignment.
The Human Resources Administration is punishing her "for not going through their program and taking it upon myself for going to school," she said at Sobro's center on East 149th Street. "Welfare reform doesn't help you get educated. When you do it yourself, you break the rules."
Ms. De Jesus is part of the surge in welfare recipients seeking help with interviewing techniques, resume writing and word processing, as they navigate the transition from dependence to self-sufficiency. Many of them arrive with new-found anxiety after workfare assignments that lead nowhere, said Plinio Ayala, the director of operations at Sobro's training center.
"This whole push for workfare has created a sense of urgency," Mr. Ayala said. "The competition out there is a lot stronger. People on public assistance with minimal skills are competing against high school grads and college grads. We're having a tougher time matching people with jobs."
TOUGH times are all around, it seems. Each day, people wander into the group's office looking for some program to help them get a job. Some are referred by the welfare agency. Others, like Ms. De Jesus, take the initiative themselves and sort out the consequences later.
Yet administrators at Sobro wondered why some of their clients were yanked out of their training programs to report to workfare assignments that relied little on any skills they already had. While their clients could have appealed to stay in class, they said, at least 100 of them had left during the last six months when the city's Work Experience Program beckoned.
"One elderly woman dropped out of our program and was forced into the Work Experience Program," said Deborah MacFarlane, Sobro's vice president for education and employment. "We begged H.R.A. to put her in a hospital, put her anywhere. No. They put her on the Major Deegan."
Nevertheless, Ms. MacFarlane's group was able to find jobs for 1,000 people last year, a figure she thinks could increase if Sobro had more time to train individuals. Instead, she said her Job Club program for women on welfare was cut by the city to four weeks from eight.
"There's a direct correlation between length of training and the starting wage," Ms. MacFarlane said. "The problem is that welfare mothers are expected to get a job in the shortest amount of time with the least experience, the highest expectations and the highest need."
TEN women sat in cubicles in a nearby classroom, phone books open next to folders of resumes and classified ads. The women in the Job Club make up to 90 calls a day to potential employers. It's known as cold calling, which in their case probably describes the reception they get. Not one has found a job.
"We called every number in this book, and whenever they say they're hiring, we ask if we can send our resumes or come in for an interview," said Jewel Frye. "They say, 'We don't have nothing. No. Thank you.' I ain't heard yes yet."
The women arrived here after six-month workfare stints. They start another program at Bronx Community College next week.
"I'm running in circles," said Darlene Bates. "They want me off welfare. I'll get off when I find a job. All I want is to find a job and give welfare the boot."
Her friends chimed in: there are no jobs.
Victoria Baez ducked into the room. She had once been among them; now she works at Sobro. She knows there are jobs.
"But the majority of jobs are minimum wage," she said. "How could you tell somebody with four kids to work for minimum wage? If welfare cuts you off, you have to pay rent, electric and everything else. Is it going to be worth it to get off welfare?"

HEADLINE: Anchoring a Future In Atlantic City;
Convention Center Leads Effort To Broaden the Revival of a City

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, May 1

 BODY:
Atlantic City's new convention center opened this week, a muted steel, glass and sand-colored granite structure as long as six football fields and as wide as two that officials hope will be the key to transforming the city into a place travelers will want to visit for more than just a day of gambling.
Equipped with high-speed Internet connections, a video conferencing system and 275 miles of fiber optic cable, the building is the most technologically advanced convention center around, convention planners say. It has a total of 610,000 square feet of exhibition and meeting space, and it is the 11th-largest convention center in the country. When all the walls on the main exhibit floor are opened, the convention center will have 500,000 square feet of contiguous open space, more than any other hall in the Northeast, including the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. 
 But even this cavernous space with its sun-splashed atrium will be hard-pressed to contain the vaulting ambitions of the city and its casino operators as they look to it to boost the $3.8 billion dollar a year gambling industry and increase the tourist traffic in this 44-block-long city.
For the gaming industry, the convention center is part of an attempt to expand the Atlantic City gambling market, now dominated by people who live within 250 miles and drive in for the day. It is a market that most analysts concede is nearly tapped out. From 1995 to last year, gambling revenue grew a scant 1.76 percent, well below the rate of inflation.
For the city, the $268 million convention center, with a built-in train station connecting it to Philadelphia 55 miles to the west and an adjacent 500-room, noncasino hotel, is the leading edge of more than $7 billion in new construction planned over the next five years. That work is expected to add half a dozen theme-oriented, resortlike gambling hotels to the city's current 14 casinos. The long-depressed city hopes to re-emerge as a resort and vacation destination as attractive for longer stays as Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla. It hopes to edge its way back to the resort status that it had from the 1870's to the 1950's, when people flocked there to promenade on its boardwalk and take in the ocean views.
"The convention center will draw visitors and conventioneers," Mayor James Whelan said in an interview. "But just as significantly it will dispel the reputation we have had for a long time as a place where it is impossible to get anything done. This is done, and that ought to send a message to the development community."
There are, nevertheless, signs of conflict between the differing realities of the casino and convention businesses. In recent months, several New Jersey groups like the state bar association and the dental society, which are used to holding meetings and conventions in the casino hotels here, have complained that meeting space has been converted to gambling space as the casinos fiercely compete for customers.
In addition, they said, weekend meetings have become all but impossible because the casino hotels refuse to set aside prepaid rooms. The hotels would rather give away the rooms to high rollers, who drop thousands of dollars at the gaming tables. As a result, the New Jersey State Bar Association will be holding its 1998 convention outside Atlantic City for the first time in 93 years, said Jay Greenblatt, the association's incoming president. He said that the convention would move to East Rutherford and that the group would consider returning to Atlantic City if the market changed in its favor.
But today, on the first of three days of events marking the opening of the convention center, touring school children stared wide-eyed at the colorful and huge fish that hung high in the atrium and at the 27, two-foot-square whimsical medallions arrayed high along the atrium wall depicting crabs, sea horses, snails and the like. Workmen polished the floors and railings, and waiters set up a vast dining area for a formal dedication and black tie gala on Friday while exhibitors readied the main halls for a show addressing convention planners.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf demonstrated the center's communications capabilities in a second-floor meeting room by holding a video conference on the subject of leadership with high school students in Newark and Jersey City.
Even Miss America, Tara Dawn Holland, who was crowned last September in the city's old Convention Hall on the Boardwalk, was impressed. To the early chagrin of Miss America pageant officials, the new center was not outfitted to handle the televised pageant, which is as emblematic of this city as salt water taffy. But Miss Holland observed that the old convention hall would remain and be refurbished for future pageants. "It's gorgeous," she said of the new center. "But, of course, the Convention Hall has fond memories for me."
In a city where legalized gambling has had a mixed record of keeping its promises of improving life for the 38,000 residents, the coming of the convention center was almost universally applauded.
Even past critics of the casinos and other city development plans, like Ernest D. Coursey, a City Councilman whose mostly black district abuts the convention center, were willing to give the center a chance. He noted that it had displaced one black housing complex and was threatening a larger black community on its northern border, but he added, "It is a beautiful building, and we look forward to it and hope that Atlantic City residents who remain will be treated just as well as the conventioneers and tourists we are attracting."
Joseph Dougherty, the owner of Dock's Oyster House, said that he had watched the ranks of restaurateurs along the city streets thin as casino hotels proliferated, their restaurants and shops aimed at keeping gamblers close to the slot machines and gaming tables.
"But conventioneers don't confine themselves to the casinos," he said. "So I think it will be tremendous for our business."
Marshall E. Murdaugh, 56, the executive director of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority, which operates the center, said that 290 trade shows and conventions were already booked for the center between now and 2007.
Among convention planners the center was an instant hit, said Gary LaBranche, vice president of the American Society of Association Executives. It is the "most technologically up-to-date," he said, catapulting Atlantic City to the top of the second tier of convention cities that are much larger.
"That's not a bad place to be in what is a seller's market now with the first-tier cities turning conventions away," he said.
Mr. Murdaugh, who prior to coming to Atlantic City served as president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau promoting the Javits Center and other New York City locations for conventions, agreed that the shore city was well-positioned. Even though the Javits Center has more square feet of exhibition space overall -- 900,000 to Atlantic City's 610,000 -- Mr. Murdaugh said that the new center had the feel of "an urban center without the urban hassles." And because the construction costs were so much lower than convention sites in New York and Philadelphia, the cost of an Atlantic City convention is lower. To highlight its advantages over its nearby neighbors, Mr. Murdaugh is marketing the center as "America's new northeast business address."
Still, the problem of hotel rooms for conventioneers is a cloud. Only 10,000 hotel rooms exist in the city now, although there are plans to increase this number to 27,000 in the next five years. Some of this is being partially financed by $175 million that will be turned back to the casinos over the five years from a tax they pay annually to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.
Marvin Roffman, a gambling analyst with Roffman Miller, an investment firm based in Philadelphia, noted that the business culture of the city was different from Las Vegas, which Atlantic City seeks to emulate. In Las Vegas, with 101,000 hotel rooms and a wealth of entertainment, retail and services in hotels, gambling operations make up 55 percent of casino hotel revenues, he said; in Atlantic City, gambling accounts for 93 percent of the revenues at the large casino hotels.
"In Las Vegas, the huge mega-casino hotels have so much, and they don't care which cash register rings up the money," Mr. Roffman said. "But it's not like that in Atlantic City, and until that changes and more hotel room are added, the city won't evolve."
Mr. Roffman and Mr. Murdaugh said that expanding the hotel space was also contingent upon working out disagreements among casino operators over subsidies to new arrivals. Some operators have threatened not to build new hotel rooms if they, too, do not get some of the tax benefits and subsidized road construction being offered to one of the newcomers, Mirage Resorts.
But Mr. Murdaugh said these problems would be worked out, and in the end, the "need for more hotel rooms will pull everyone along."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLE: THE OVERVIEW;
AFTER YEARS OF WRANGLING, ACCORD IS REACHED ON PLAN TO BALANCE BUDGET BY 2002

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration reached agreement with the Republican leadership today on a plan to balance the Federal budget in five years, using a last-minute financial windfall to help forge a deal that could alter the nation's economic and political landscape.
The pact came after years of bitter partisan wrangling, months of intense negotiations and several hours of high drama in which an astounding piece of news -- that deficits over the next five years were likely to be $225 billion lower than the Republicans had previously projected -- provided the final impetus to completing the deal. 
 In the end, that unexpected maneuvering room enabled both sides to claim victory in achieving their primary goals without undue political pain, although both the White House and the Republican leadership still had to rally support for the package within their own parties.
President Clinton argued that he had won new spending for education, health insurance for children, welfare benefits and other programs that he had made the core of his second-term agenda, all while protecting the elderly from big increases in their Medicare premiums.
"I wanted a balanced budget with balanced values," Mr. Clinton said. "I believe we have got it today."
Republicans exultantly claimed a prize that has eluded them for years, a big tax cut, including a reduction in the capital gains tax, as well as success in scaling back overall domestic spending and beginning to rein in the costs of Medicare and other entitlement programs.
"Under this budget agreement, official Washington must learn to make do with less, while Americans will keep more of what they earn, and they will be able to save it and invest it in their own families," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader.
The agreement does not insure that the budget will be balanced by 2002, because it cannot anticipate possible economic downturns or tax and spending decisions by Congress. And although the agreement won far more support today from liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans than did the outline that circulated on Capitol Hill on Thursday, it must still go through a legislative process that provides opportunities for changes and conflicts.
In a broader sense, the agreement gave Mr. Clinton a chance at a place in history as the President who restored the nation to a degree of fiscal and economic health it has not enjoyed in decades, an assertion that was bolstered by the news today that unemployment had fallen to 4.9 percent, its lowest rate in 23 years.
For the Republican majority in Congress, it was a chance to repair its image as overly partisan and obstructionist and to take home to voters a fiscal austerity package that leaves them largely insulated from Democratic attacks.
That the two sides were able to reach an agreement with so little political pain was largely a function of the strong economy, and the resulting decline in the deficit. Even without a budget agreement, this year's deficit is now expected to fall nearly 30 percent, to $75 billion, its lowest level relative to the size of the economy in more than two decades.
The Federal budget was last in balance in 1969. It began growing rapidly in the early 1980's after President Reagan and a Democratic Congress enacted tax cuts and spending increases and hit a peak of $290 billion in 1992. Since then the deficit has steadily declined, thanks in part to tax increases pushed through by Mr. Clinton in 1993 over Republican objections but primarily to a long period of steady economic growth.
The deal's major provisions, covering 1998 through 2002, include these:
*A reduction of $58 billion in domestic nonmilitary spending, about $12 billion more than Mr. Clinton had initially proposed. But the budget would provide $34 billion for most of Mr. Clinton's priority programs, including health insurance for up to 5 million children, the restoration of welfare benefits to legal immigrants and expanding the student loan and Head Start programs.
*A reduction in the planned growth of Medicare spending by $115 billion, accomplished largely through reductions in payments to health care providers. Elderly beneficiaries would have to pay slightly higher premiums. The Medicare trust fund, which would otherwise go bankrupt in 2001, would remain solvent until 2007.
*Tax cuts of $135 billion, partly offset by $50 billion in revenues from closing loopholes and extending existing taxes set to expire. The Republicans assured the White House that $35 billion of the cuts would be allocated to the President's proposal for tuition tax breaks. The remaining $100 billion would go to a reduction in the capital gains tax, a phased-in doubling of the amount exempted from estate taxes to $1.2 million and a credit for families with children.
The deal does not specify the size of the capital gains tax cut, but aides to Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who, as head of the House Ways and Means Committee, is responsible for all tax legislation, said there appeared to be enough money available to reduce the top rate to the Republican leadership's goal of 19.8 percent from 28 percent if the members of the committee agree to do so.
The cost of the tax cuts in the five years after 2002, a major impediment to a deal in the last few days, would be limited to $165 billion, a level that both sides agreed would not lead to a return of big deficits.
Although the broad outlines of the budget deal were in place by Thursday, it was completed this afternoon only after the negotiators agreed to tradeoffs made possible by the Congressional Budget Office's dramatic decision on Thursday to slash its deficit estimates for coming years.
The new projections allowed negotiators to take out politically sensitive components of the deal like a legislated change in the cost-of-living formula for Social Security and to scale back cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.
The budget office told Republicans on Wednesday that it was working on new projections that would show the scope of the nation's fiscal problems to be far smaller than anticipated. By Thursday, budget office officials had concluded that the deficit would be about $45 billion a year lower than they had previously projected, $225 billion lower over the five years covered by the budget deal.
The negotiators, however, had already decided on their own to use slightly more optimistic assumptions about the deficit. Still, the gain was substantial, $12 billion for 2002 alone.
And the news was shocking to both sides. Administration officials learned of it on Thursday from a phone call during a meeting with House Democrats. They returned to the White House to mull over the implications, with some aides saying it could scuttle the deal by causing Republicans to demand bigger tax cuts and Democrats more spending.
Indeed, when the negotiators met at 9:45 this morning in a hideaway office deep under the Capitol, there was considerable tension on both sides, participants said. The Republican team was led by Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, along with their top aides, G. William Hoagland and Rick May. Congressional Democrats were represented by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina. The Administration's team included Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff; Franklin D. Raines, the budget chief; Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin; John Hilley, the Congressional liaison, and Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council.
But it quickly became apparent that both sides were willing to carve up the windfall in a way that would improve the agreement's prospects for winning bipartisan support, particularly given the negative reaction that early reports of the package had brought on Thursday from liberal House Democrats and conservative Republicans.
The negotiators decided that the new-found money gave them the chance to remove from the agreement a proposal that would have had the effect of lowering cost-of-living increases in Social Security and other Government benefits and raising taxes for some people. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress had warned that they might have to vote against the package if it contained the provision reducing the Government's main cost of living gauge, the Consumer Price Index, to correct for an overestimate of inflation by about one percentage point. The negotiators had planned to seek legislative approval to double a 0.15 percentage point reduction in the index expected to be implemented on technical grounds by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The negotiators agreed to phase in increased Medicare premiums over seven years instead of five, and to exempt more low-income recipients from higher premiums. At the urging of Vice President Al Gore, they eliminated a per-person cap on Medicaid spending, a proposal that had drawn fire from the nation's governors and from many Democrats. And they agreed that about $8 billion in additional funding could be allocated over five years for transportation spending.
As word of the changes spread across Capitol Hill, the compromises defused much of the criticism leveled at the deal on Thursday. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he was "encouraged at the movement towards addressing Democratic concerns."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts said, "There's been some improvement but I still want to see more details." And in a sentiment common to many members of both parties who had watched the budget wars rage for the last several years, Senator Charles S. Robb, a Virginia Democrat, said, "This is the best deal either side could get."
 The article also referred incorrectly to a $290 billion figure from the 1992 budget. It represented the deficit that year, not the entire budget.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 8, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a balanced-budget agreement between the White House and Congressional Republicans referred incorrectly to the party makeup of Congress in the early 1980's. While Democrats controlled the House, Republicans held the Senate.

Chart: "The Deal"
Here are the highlights of yesterday's budget agreement. Figures are five-year totals. Spending cuts are subtracted from what would otherwise be spent to maintain existing programs through 2002.
 
Taxes
$135 billion in cuts, offset by some $50 billion in revenues from renewing expired taxes and closing lopholes. Scholarships and tax credits for college tuition, a White House favorite, will claim $35 billion. The other $100 billion will be used largely for tax credits for families with children; to lower estate taxes and to reduce the 28 per cent tax rate on capital gains; Republicans aim for a 19.8 per cent rate.
 
Domestic programs & benefits
$58 billion in unspecified program cuts; $34 billion in new spending to extend health and disability benefits to legal immigrants and to provide free health insurance for up to 5 million poor children.
 
Medicare
About $115 billion in savings, mostly by cutting payments to medical providers and increasing many insurance premiums by $1 a month.
 
Medicaid
About $16 billion in savings from limiting payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of medicaid patients.
 
Military
About $85 billion in unspecified cuts.

HEADLINE: A Literary Pilgrimage With Diaper Bag

BYLINE: By SUZANNE BERNE; SUZANNE BERNE is a novelist who lives in Massachusetts.

 BODY:
ON a recent Saturday morning, in an uncharacteristic impulse to complicate my life by venturing somewhere rather than simplify it by staying at home, I decided to coax my family into our station wagon for a visit to Walden Pond. It's not far from where we live, and lately I have been rereading Henry David Thoreau's "Walden," which is what gave me the idea of escaping my quiet desperation at facing laundry and the dishes to reflect instead on Nature, self-reliance and the beauty of solitude. Or at least go for a drive.
Just around this time of year a century and a half ago, Thoreau, similarly disgusted with the tyranny of ordinary housekeeping, borrowed an axe and hiked down to the woods around Walden in Concord, Mass., to build himself a one-room cabin, then sat down and wrote about it. He lived alone there for two years and two months, simply and wisely, eating mostly rye and cornmeal, potatoes and rice, washing everything down with spring water. 
 It was a luxuriously austere life, rich in frugality. Eight months of food cost him $8.74, as he will tell you himself in his chapter on "Economy." Birds, ants and woodchucks were his neighbors; for news, he listened to wind through the trees, hooting owls and the freight train whistle. When he felt restless, he opened his door and lost himself in the woods.
Ah, to be Henry Thoreau for a month, a week, an afternoon! To live deliberately in a nice, quiet hut, confronting only the essential facts of life, which would not include car payments, answering-machine messages or a single product featuring Barney.
Inspired by these iconoclastic thoughts, I began gathering sweaters, coats, hats and boots together for a sojourn in the woods in muddy April, while issuing the first of several warnings required by my offspring, ages 2 and three months, before we hazard any journey, near or far. I also needed to pack snacks (apple juice in no-spill sippy cups, raisins, peanut butter crackers, bananas, granola bars), as well as a blankie, a binky, several diapers, diaper wipes, an emergency change of clothes for the younger and a stuffed elephant. All essentials.
The dog had to be leashed and dragged away from exploring her animal nature in the trash can. By the time I'd answered the phone twice, located my husband's keys and wallet, changed two unphilosophical children, dressed them and strapped them into their car seats, the sun was high in the everlasting blue sky and everyone wanted lunch. As Thoreau noted in approximately these words, and as any traveler will corroborate: She who goes alone can start today; but she who travels with her family must wait till they are ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.
But despite a morning frittered away by detail, there we were in the car at last, hurtling along Route 2 toward Concord, obeying higher laws by ignoring the speed limit. Everywhere the bud was on the tree, the robin on the wing, the snow melting in black drifts along the road. Soon enough we were turning onto Route 126, where Walden Pond lies, glinting as transcendently blue as it did in 1845. "God's Drop," Thoreau had wanted to rechristen the lake, an unexpectedly prescient name given the landfill that sprawls on the hillside across the street, circled by a couple of fat seagulls.
At 62 acres, Walden Pond is not especially large, nor is it any longer particularly pristine, even forgetting about the landfill. The pond's eastern shore is now a public beach, presided over by a bunkerlike bathhouse. In the summer herds of small children plunge, shrieking, in and out of the water, differently invigorated than Thoreau was by his dips, but invigorated still. The ice cream truck rings its bell; mothers scold their youngsters. Cigarette smoke wafts here and there, mingling with the scent of coconut oil from sunbathers crowding the sand. So much for solitude. Yet Walden remains a lovely lap of water, surrounded by woods; "a mirror which no stone can crack," Thoreau described it somewhere, "earth's eye." With maybe a cataract or two.
Times change, of course, and progress has its costs. Almost 60 years ago E. B. White, another literary hero of mine, likewise traveled to Walden Pond to catch a hint of the philosopher's life there. Instead of sleeping in a cabin, however, he spent a night at the Colonial Inn in Concord, a building once owned by the Thoreau family; for this privilege he paid $4.25, including his meals. Not much from our perspective, but Thoreau would have been appalled.
These days $4.25 wouldn't cover a Belgian waffle at the Colonial Inn, now an upscale hostelry advertising "cozy country charm" along with fax service and telephones with data ports. As we drove along, I recalled White's assessment of Walden as "a document of increasing pertinence; each year it seems to gain a little headway, as the world loses ground."
We pulled into the Walden Pond State Reservation parking lot, itself worth visiting for its reproduction of Thoreau's shingled cabin near the ticket booth, an edifice meant to provide the visitor with a sense of where he lived and what he lived for. It was closed just then; while my husband searched for a parking place, I hurried over and peered through one of the cabin's two windows to behold people peering in through the other.
Inside, the cabin boasts historical furnishings, including a wooden chair, a table, a narrow pallet and, during my visit, a plastic wastebasket and a tub of driveway sealer. Not much cozy country charm, but faithful to the spirit of Thoreau, whose idea of domestic decor was a lamp and a molasses jug. A statue of the philosopher himself stands a few feet from the cabin door, arm outstretched, gazing meditatively into his bronze palm, where an admirer has placed a candy wrapper.
It was my intention to lead my family partway around the pond to view the actual site of Thoreau's house, staked out by four granite markers. I have stopped there several times on earlier expeditions, ruminated for a few minutes, then added a stone to the nearby rock pile, as people do who want to pay material homage. E. B. White has a stone in there somewhere, too, although it was a very small pile when he made his contribution.
I'm not sure Thoreau would care for this commemorative heap, or for the eager pilgrims who come poking around his sacred haunts in sneakers and baseball hats, exclaiming over leaf-clogged coves and bullfrogs and scrubby oak trees, quoting lines from his book, hoping to recognize a place they've never been. Most depart somewhat disappointed. But then this is the inevitable curse of visiting a literary shrine: It is never what it was to you before you saw it for yourself.
Perhaps instinctively understanding this paradox, my family refused to get out of the car once established in a parking space. Both little girls were weeping and my husband wore a stoical aspect. "Go on ahead," he said, shouting to be heard. "You take a walk."
Alone?
I hesitated, something Thoreau would not have done, nor E. B. White for that matter. My babies cried louder. The dog began to bark. Would Walden have been written if Thoreau had been a family man?
For an answer, a single robin sang out from a pine branch overhead. Imperceptibly the air grew cooler; the mud looked very deep. In the distance, Walden glimmered, shimmered, more a mirage than ever.
"We'll try again soon," my husband promised, as we pulled back onto the road. The humming tires soothed our children -- a vibration of the universal lyre? -- and just as we passed Dairy Joy, they fell asleep. In the sudden hush, I could hear myself think, which is the closest I've come to the philosopher's life in quite a while.

 MAKING ENDS MEET
 How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work.
 By Kathryn Edin and Laura Lein.
 305 pp. New York:
 Russell Sage Foundation.
 Cloth, $42.50. Paper, $19.95. 
 In "The Glory of Byzantium," a spectacular exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, an unforgettable icon depicts a procession of struggling souls trying to climb a ladder to heaven but always in danger of falling off into the clutches of gleeful demons. That image haunted me throughout David Zucchino's meticulous chronicle of the perilous lives of Odessa Williams, her eight adult children and numerous grandchildren. Mrs. Williams, 56, is one of two welfare mothers whose experiences are recorded in "Myth of the Welfare Queen." Mr. Zucchino, the foreign editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from South Africa, approached his domestic assignment among the poor of North Philadelphia in the spirit of a correspondent who recognized that he was basically a stranger to an alienated population within his own country.
"Making Ends Meet," which compares the survival strategies of welfare mothers with those of the "working poor," provides an equally disturbing statistical portrait of the kind of women whose individual lives are explored by Mr. Zucchino. The economic analysis, prepared for the Russell Sage Foundation by Kathryn Edin, an assistant professor of sociology at Rutgers University, and Laura Lein, a researcher in the School of Social Work at the University of Texas, Austin, is based on interviews with 379 mothers who receive welfare or work at low-wage jobs.
The message of both books is unequivocal: the porous barrier between welfare and work bears little resemblance to the middle-class image of a job -- any job -- as the first rung on a ladder leading out of poverty. Unfortunately, Mr. Zucchino dilutes the point by alternating between the Williams family and Cheri Honkala, a savvy welfare rights advocate known for such enterprises as setting up a tent encampment for the homeless on the grounds of the Liberty Bell. Ms. Honkala, 32, who has only one child and is off welfare by the end of the book (she makes several hundred dollars a night as a topless dancer), is clearly atypical -- in her choices and their availability.
Mrs. Williams, born in rural Georgia into a world of few choices, was chopping cotton and pulling string beans in the fields at age 5. She became one of millions of blacks who left the South in the 1950's at precisely the point when Northern cities began their long economic decline. When the Marriott Corporation announced recently that it would hire 550 workers for a new hotel, 10,000 applicants lined up in freezing weather. Implicit in Mr. Zucchino's account is the question of how the end of "welfare as we know it" can provide work for the 9,450 who couldn't be hired.
The Russell Sage Foundation researchers found that mothers with paying jobs spent twice as much a month as welfare mothers on expenses like day care and transportation and on formerly subsidized housing and medical costs. Nevertheless, many women continued to shift back and forth between welfare and work, hoping against hope to find a job leading to a career ladder rather than a wall.
Odessa Williams's 39-year-old daughter Joyce had worked for 10 years as a nurse's aide before she injured her back lifting a patient and turned to welfare. Then she enrolled in a medical data-processing training program. While she was in class, a son and a nephew began playing with matches, set fire to a mattress and seriously damaged her house. Joyce's 19-year-old daughter Iesha (already the mother of three) had fallen asleep in front of the television set while she was supposed to be watching the children. Joyce did manage to graduate from the training program, but the computerized medical job never materialized. After finding another job that paid $7.50 an hour -- but left her poorer after paying for transportation -- she went back on welfare.
The absence of rational calculation, regarding everything from fire safety to birth control, is the hallmark of lives described by Mr. Zucchino as being "utterly dominated by subsistence concerns." Yet new welfare restrictions -- especially the denial of benefits for children born while a mother is already receiving public aid -- are based on the assumption that poor women will make the rational decision that further childbearing is not in their best interest.
Odessa Williams receives approximately $1,382 a month, including welfare and Social Security disability, for her family of five (she has assumed responsibility for the four children of her crack-addicted daughter Brenda). She acquires basic household goods by methodically scrounging through trash. Recently she began preparing for Christmas by assuming the $58-a-month payments for a "Hooked on Phonics" set of audiotapes and books. And every month, she puts aside more money for other children's gifts. It is easy to see why Mr. Zucchino grew so fond of this devoted matriarch. Mrs. Williams desperately wants her grandchildren to learn, but her own education is too deficient for her to understand that visits to a public library might be just as effective as an expensive set of gimmicks promoted on television.
What is the point of yet another investigation into the lives of people whose problems sound so complex as to be irremediable? Leon Dash of The Washington Post, whose splendid 1996 book "Rosa Lee" chronicled the experience of a welfare family far more disordered than the Williamses, has argued that "we must agree on what the facts are, regardless of our political viewpoints, before we can offer those trapped in poverty a way out." "Myth of the Welfare Queen" and "Making Ends Meet" raise the disturbing further question of whether the bottom of the ladder can even be seen, much less reached, from the deepest part of the abyss.

HEADLINE: The RENTOCRACY;
The Case for Rent Regulation

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts; Sam Roberts is deputy editor of the Week in Review section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Here's where Bill Eimicke comes out on rent regulation: "Fundamentally, I have a problem with it, and I can understand anyone who believes in the United States system of capitalism would have a problem." Despite these reservations, he's for keeping some version of rent regulation -- doing away with it would be even worse. "There's more to risk than there is go gain." 
 Eimicke has earned the right to be heard on the subject. He is an unabashed liberal and Columbia University professor (and Columbia tenant) who as State Housing Commissioner during the Cuomo years administered the tangle of regulations that govern rents on more than one in three New York City dwellings. But Eimicke isn't enlisting in the crusade to scrap the system altogether.
Nobody defends the rent regulation bureaucracy that was first codified during World War II. But given some important conditions, knowledgeable people like Eimicke think the system remains defensible. Here's how they answer the arguments made against the regulatory regime loosely called "rent control."
[Only 70,000 of the city's 1.1 million or so regulated apartments are subject to the strictest controls.]
Rent control governs apartments built before 1947 and occupied by the same tenant since 1971. About a million more apartments (those built before 1973 with more than six units) are rent stabilized -- governed by somewhat looser regulations but with rent increases still subject to official guidelines. Nearly 600,000 other rental apartments are unregulated.
[Rent regulation applies citywide, but the debate about price controls largely concerns Manhattan.]
Among apartments renting for less than $600 a month, three out of four are governed by rent regulation. But in poorer neighborhoods, the market is already determined by what tenants can afford: market rents are below nominal regulated rents. In Jamaica, Queens, for example, according to the real-estate industry's estimates, market prices are about 25 percent less than the regulated rate. On the Upper West Side, though, the median rent would rise 36 percent a month if they were rapidly decontrolled. Without special protection, where would tenants on fixed incomes, the poor, the elderly and struggling artists go?
[What about all those celebrities who pay peanuts to rent cavernous apartments?]
Generally, vacated apartments become deregulated if they can be rented for $2,000 a month or more. Even occupied apartments can legally be deregulated if the rent reaches $2,000 and the household income surpasses $250,000 for two consecutive years. Maybe those thresholds are too high. Still, a tenant who earns even $100,000 but has a spouse and children to support might be hard pressed to pay 25 percent of his income on rent.
[Arguably, rent regulation is a middle-class subsidy, like lower property taxes on one- and two-family homes. But regulation is also about guaranteeing at least minimal building maintenance and services.]
There's evidence that regulation -- and the threat of mandated rent reductions -- offers great leverage over aggressively greedy landlords, managing agents and even co-op boards that might otherwise find means to force tenants out.
[Rent regulation would lapse if more than 5 percent of apartments were available. But has regulation really deterred developers from building more?]
Somewhat. But to rectify the situation, swaths of manufacturing and commercial districts would have to be rezoned to allow for housing. Also, so-called affordable housing is hard to build without subsidies or tax abatements. Plenty of higher-priced apartments are being built anyway -- and landlords may charge the first tenants whatever the market will bear. And, what the Legislature taketh away it can bring back.
[Not all economists condemn rent regulation -- even if the theoretical goal is to redistribute income in a city where diversity is a virtue.]
Writing a few years ago in The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Richard Arnott of Boston College concluded that original rent controls aside, New York's more flexible system of rent stabilization deserves another look. "Many of the claimed effects of second-generation controls are imperceptible," he wrote. "It is possible to design a set of rent regulations that results in an improvement in efficiency over the unrestricted market equilibrium."
[Yes, but the truth is that the defenders of rent regulation aren't moved by economics, only politics.]
Cynics say that in repeatedly renewing rent regulation, the Legislature has been guided largely by one equation: Tenants outnumber landlords. To which Eimicke replies: "If you're arguing that it's because the people want it, excuse me. This is a democracy."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Caroline Werth;
What's Up at the New Old Shubert Theater

 BODY:
CAROLINE WERTH, "a New York City kid," as she puts it, is the president and chief operating officer of the Shubert Performing Arts Center and one of New Haven's most enthusiastic cheerleaders. "You come into a city that is fun, has life, that is safe," she said.
Ms. Werth received the 28th annual Arts Manager of the Year award by Arts Management Newsletter on April 7, in recognition of organizing an effort by the theater to purchase its mortgage note. The largest contribution, $1.3 million, came from the state. 
 The City of New Haven had been paying $456,000 a year on the mortgage, money now available to the theater itself. In three years, Ms. Werth also increased non-ticket income to $800,000 largely from Connecticut-based corporations. The Department of Economic Development estimates the Shubert brings in about $30 million to New Haven, Ms. Werth says. "We are a huge tourist destination," she declared. "It is not uncommon for restaurants to request our sales numbers for the week before ordering."
Indeed, her view of the arts world is down to earth. "I see performing arts centers like neighborhood grocery stores," she explained. "Some people can go in and buy lots of things lots of the time. Some people only go in once in a while to buy a few things. But everybody has to get in there if it's going to be a successful store."
Recently Ms. Werth met to discuss the way the Shubert fits into New Haven and her plans for the Arts Center. Following are some excerpts of that conversation:
Q. Can the Shubert survive just by selling tickets?
A. By today's standards the Shubert with 1,600 seats is very intimate.Because finances, shows -- not always shows but dance performances, symphony orchestras -- only make commercial sense by playing in 3,000-seat houses. That's double the size of the Shubert.
We enjoy sold-out houses more often than not. But there is no way we could charge our customers what it's costing us every time we open our doors.
The Shubert had been running a deficit for a good long time. Last year we we raised $1 million in corporate sponsorship and annual contributed income. It wasn't enough. The gap between earned income and expenses was about $1.5 million. With the $500,000 now coming to us from the city, we would be able to see our way clear to black ink. I am very proud to say we have done it.
Q. How did you accomplish that?
A. Before we went to lobby everyone from the Governor's office on down, we looked at past and current seasons. We also looked at other comparable theaters. We went to the Office of Economic Development. They really put us through our paces. Then we went to the Governor and the Mayor This process went on for 18 months.
Yale joined in. They recognized the cultural impact of the Shubert and said, "We live here. We can't afford to see the Shubert close."
Yale really took the lead. The Community Foundation for Greater New Haven, the state and city came together to help.
Q. Why did so many people want to help?
A. The Shubert is the most distinguished theater in American theater history. It was the tryout ground for anyone who was anyone in entertainment through the 60's. It was home to all of Rodgers and Hammerstein's world premieres.
We are very respectful of this beautiful space that has all sorts of memories coming out of the walls. By today's standards it makes very little financial sense. At most Broadway houses, shows are designed to "sit down." When you take a show onto the road it is a more expensive proposition because it takes a great deal of wear and tear. It must be built to take apart. "Sunset Boulevard" is an example of a show that was just too expensive to take on the road.
Q. With the Shubert, Long Wharf, the Yale Repertory Theater and the Palace in New Haven are there simply too many theaters?
A. What sets New Haven apart is its cultural richness and diversity. We are all doing different kind of seasons. Long Wharf and the Yale Repertory Theater are creating new work and much of it travels on to Broadway and other parts of the country.
What we are doing here is everything. We are continuing the Shubert's famous legacy of doing theater, but in the last four years we have broadened our scope. We are dedicated to the notion that there's got to be something for everyone. It is not unusual to have the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater one weekend and "Damn Yankees" the next and then Wynton Marsalis, a children's musical and then "Jam on the Groove," a hip-hop show, the next weekend. There's a complete diversity in our programming. It is certainly very commercial.
Q. You are known for your substantial education and outreach efforts. Will they continue?
A. Because our programming is so diversified we have the great luxury of developing an extraordinary educational program. I have long subscribed to the idea of programming for young people with the same artists and attractions that we present to adult audiences.
I ask everyone who comes to the Shubert to think of some educational component. This season the Canadian Brass did two master classes -- one for 600 brass playing middle school students, the other for 1,600 students.
Savion Glover, the tap dancer and choreographer, did a lecture demonstration. Wynton Marsalis did the same kind of programs for 1,600 kids. Pilobolus and Jam on the Groove did classes.
Q. Are these lecture demonstrations limited to New Haven schools?
A. We are the only venue in the state that literally draws from Westchester County to Springfield, Mass. We have to accommodate the New Haven schools first but we have been adding additional programs. We do educational student guides, and materials and visits. We have an advisory group, the Educational Committee to help us.
Q. How do you find local groups to help you?
A. There is a Community Outreach Committee involved in our Family Club. We go out and raise funds to buy tickets from ourselves. The Outreach Committee helps to determine which family-based organizations should receive the tickets. Groups range from a neighborhood watch group to a Y.M.C.A. program. The point is to help the family unit, whether it is a traditional or a non-traditional unit. We feel that theater is a terrific thing for them to do together.
We complement that program by going out into the neighborhoods. We answer questions that range from "What is the appropriate dress?" to "What is this music about?" The purpose is that by the time they come to the Shubert they feel at ease about being here.
Q. The demographics of New Haven are changing. Does that affect planning the upcoming seasons?
A. We are now embarking on an annual week of the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater. We recently had Tito Puente here and we hope to have Celia Cruz and Tito Puente next fall. There is no question that we will be doing more programming to cater to our Latino community.
We have an absolutely amazing diversity of audiences here. It's funny to hear board members and Shubert regulars say, "I don't know these people. I used to know everyone."
The audiences at the Shubert are like nowhere else. It has to do with the sense of ownership people feel about this place.
Q. Aren't there going to be some big changes coming up?
A. You can't make the walls expand. I do hope someday that we will have a wonderful large facility here to also house "Phantom of the Opera"-size productions and a great hall for symphony music. Right now we are embarking on renovating and refurbishing this wonderful old theater. There will be comfortable seats. They will be a deep rose. We were careful not to change the color schemes. We wanted to use a deeper shade so everyone would know this was new, but not change the current character.
There will be new carpeting and painting. The cafeteria design will be all new next September. There are a lot of enhancements. Then we will open with Neil Simon's pre-Broadway show, "Proposals," in what we call the new old Shubert Theater.

 BODY:
IF you are planning to drive a rental car around County Clare this summer, and you charge it on American Express, the venture may cost more than you expect. Next month, American Express will take three more countries off the list of places where its card holders can get free damage coverage in lieu of buying the rental company's collision damage waiver.
In its "F.Y.I." flier sent to card holders, a four-page document of rather small type, the company said that effective June 1, its car-rental loss and damage insurance plan would not be valid in Jamaica, Ireland or Israel. Four years ago American Express eliminated coverage for rentals in Italy, New Zealand and Australia. In New Zealand and Australia, government regulations require that the cost of the collision damage waiver be included in the rental cost, so a renter gets it automatically. The change in Italy arose because of a high level of thefts. 
 The American Express flier notes that coverage for damage or loss of a rental car consumes $1.59 of each annual fee. Questions about coverage are answered at (800) 338-1670.
At the moment, holders of gold cards from Mastercard and Visa are still covered in Jamaica, Ireland and Israel. The Visa and Mastercard gold-card fliers, unlike American Express's, do not list the excluded countries but say only that with certain exceptions, coverage is available worldwide.
Marianne Fulgenzi, vice president for media programs at Mastercard, said that her company's help-line supervisor reported no calls from card holders complaining that the credit card coverage had been rejected.
The people who spoke for both Visa and Mastercard used phrases that sounded as if the Jamaica-Ireland-Israel situation might not continue for long. Carolyn Bretschneider, a spokeswoman for Visa, said that her company is not planning any change "at this time." So people renting cars overseas, especially those making reservations in the United States, should check with their card companies to learn whether they should sign up for collision damage waivers. The Visa number is (800) 847-2911, Mastercard (800) 622-7747
The collision damage waiver, although used like insurance, was legally declared not insurance in New York State when the Insurance Department wanted to regulate it a decade ago. Other states do not require insurance licenses for the sale of the collision damage waiver, either. The small type that few renters ever read says that buying the waiver means that the renting company will not require the renter to pay for collision damage or theft of the car, providing all the rental rules are met -- traffic laws are obeyed, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is avoided, and the like.
 
Freeze on Credit
Emily Porter of American Express said two "business reasons" led to her company's shift: a small proportion of card holders used this benefit in the countries involved, but there was a disproportionately high number of claims there. She said the causes could include economic conditions and the state of roads, but she would not differentiate among the countries or say how long the company had been watching the claim levels.
All three credit organizations dropped Italy in 1993 because of heavy theft. Thefts, including ones carried out on the road by teams of thieves after tires were vandalized in parking spots, caused a rise in losses to the rental and card companies. The rental companies in Italy then put in a direct surcharge of $11 to $15 a day to cover theft only. The credit cards were still covering for collision damage, but when renters invoked the coverage, the auto-rental companies put a freeze on their credit cards of $5,000 to $14,000, depending on the value of the car. This freeze stayed on until the car was returned whole, and sometimes longer. People who did not have a second credit card would then be virtually unable to charge anything else during the trip, and would usually buy the collision damage waiver to avoid the freeze. American Express said at the time it dropped its coverage for Italy: "We were offering something useless."
No rental company interviewed for this article reported anything of this sort going on in Ireland, Israel or Jamaica. Meloyde Blancett-Scott, a spokeswoman for Thrifty Rent-a-Car, said that her Ireland affiliate reported a moderate but steady rise in damage there, but nothing dramatic. Lauren Garvey of Hertz said there was nothing noteworthy in Ireland. John Quirk, Avis vice president for international sales, said that his company had noticed no increased claim activity in the three countries.
 
Assessing the Damage
What is the change going to cost American Express card holders? Through the end of May, according to Alfred Celentano, manager of Europe by Car, a New York brokerage agent, a medium-sized car in Ireland will cost $179 a week without taxes; the collision damage waiver will add $15 a day, or $105 a week. Europe by Car uses Thrifty Rent-a-Car in Ireland.
Michael Wellner, owner of Kemwel in Harrison, N.Y., operates in all three places. A medium-car rental in Ireland or Israel costs "a couple of hundred dollars" a week, he said, and the collision damage waiver an average of $9 or $10 more a day, or $63 to $70 a week. In Jamaica, he said, a rental is $300 a week and the collision damage waiver $10 a day, or $70 a week.
At Avis, Mr. Quirk said that a collision damage waiver in Ireland costs $18 to $46 a day, depending on the car, a rather stiff fee. In Israel, he said the cost is $16 to $25 a day, and in Jamaica, $10 a day.
Mr. Wellner said that a rental for Italy with his company, with theft and collision insurance included, costs $275 a week for a three-passenger car, $375 a week for a four-passenger model.
When renting for himself in the United States, Mr. Wellner said, he usually buys the collision damage waiver, because the credit card coverage provides only a backup to his own auto insurance. Such coverage, described as secondary by Visa and Mastercard and excess by American Express, will pay a deductible or any part not paid by insurance the renter holds, but the impact of the collision falls on the renter's personal policy, which may increase premiums.
"Everyone would be better served if all rental rates were all-inclusive," Mr. Wellner said. "The credit card companies don't want to be in the insurance business; they don't want to handle the hassle of a desperate guy on the phone from the Frankfurt airport with a plane to catch and a car-rental company that won't let let him leave until the damage is paid for."
 
Perils Lurking in Small Type
Car renters relying on their credit cards' coverage for the waiver should read the small type carefully, and call if there is any doubt, because all companies exclude some kinds of rental vehicles, generally high-priced ones and those that carry a large number of passengers. Visa and American Express exclude coverage for such cars wherever rented; Mastercard excludes it only for rentals in the United States.
One thing not to forget: any credit card protection requires that the card be used for the rental.

Haunted by Drama

BYLINE: By MARY CANTWELL; MARY CANTWELL is the author of "Manhattan, When I Was Young" (Penguin).

 BODY:
IT is good to arrive in New London on a Sunday night in a chilly April because after leaving the railroad station and the small fleet of cabs that waits outside, one walks through streets that are as barren as the moon. This is, while not a ghost town, a city of ghosts, and there is no better way to sense a spook than in silence.
Nathan Hale, whose schoolhouse, moved so often a local joke has it on wheels, haunts New London. So do whaling masters, who lived in Greek Revival houses on Whale Oil Row, and 19th-century millionaires, who built their mansions out near the lighthouse, and the sailors who thronged the city's brothels and bars. 
 So does my young self, a student in a college two or so miles and a world away from downtown, whose camel's hair coat was stolen on the only night she ever ventured into one of those bars. It was St. Patrick's Day, I wanted to drink green beer at a place named Danny Shea's and it was, during four years in New London, the closest I ever came to emulating the city's most famous ghosts. They are, of course, the O'Neills: James, Ella, Jamie and Eugene.
James O'Neill, an Ireland-born actor of remarkable good looks and a history of poverty, made his name and his fortune touring for years in a play called "The Count of Monte Cristo." His wife, Ella, also of Irish descent but born into affluence, was convent-educated, a good pianist and an aspirant to upper-middle-class comforts and conveniences. Having been given morphine after the birth of her third son (a second, Edmund, died of measles) and loving it, she was, in addition, a junkie.
Jamie, her first son, was a drunk. Eugene, the third, was a playwright who won four Pulitzers and the Nobel Prize. He had three wives, only the last of whom, Carlotta, a willing, indeed eager, martyr to literature, he found satisfactory. Two of his three children killed themselves. The youngest married Charlie Chaplin.
If we know a lot about the O'Neills, it is not only because they are catnip to biographers. Rather, it is primarily because they were catnip to Eugene, who wrote a great play about a family named Tyrone which was, in truth, a family named O'Neill. At first, he said he did not want "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be published until 25 years after his death. But in 1952, the year before he died, he told his wife the restrictions no longer held. If things go wrong, "We've got a nest egg."
Eugene O'Neill's nest egg is set in Monte Cristo Cottage, which his father had cobbled together out of a building that seems to have been a store and dwelling and an abandoned one-room schoolhouse in 1884. At that time, there were no houses on the other side of Pequot Avenue, so the O'Neills' view of the Thames River (there is a famous photograph in the house of the men of the family sitting on the front porch) was unimpeded. But the foghorn that kept Mary Tyrone awake at night still sounds, and the fog that made the river invisible the morning I went to Monte Cristo Cottage is as Mary, for whom it was also a metaphor for morphine, described it: "It hides you from the world and the world from you."
Ella and James O'Neill sold the cottage in 1919, the year before James drew his last breath. By 1975, when the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, an umbrella organization for American theater projects, acquired it, the place was a mess. Support from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, from 1978 to 1980, paid for the bulk of the restoration. Since then, it has taken benefits, foundation funds and private donors to keep the house going, and to hear its staff speaking wistfully about what would be possible if only there were more money is to mourn America's seeming disregard for its small but priceless treasures.
Monte Cristo Cottage is the only house the O'Neill family ever owned and as such, it is no great shakes. "It was wrong from the start," Mary Tyrone says. "Everything was done in the cheapest way."
The cottage was a summer place, which may be one reason James O'Neill didn't spend much money on it. Another stronger reason may be that those who were poor in childhood are, like stray cats saved from alleys, never quite sure that the food bowl won't disappear.
Seen from the outside, however, it is charming in its porch, little tower, Victorian air and hilly, stone-walled site. Seen on the inside, it is disconcerting. Because here, right down to the green-shaded lamp plugged into one socket of an overhead four-socket lamp, is the set for "Long Day's Journey." Eugene O'Neill, whose memory was remarkably eidetic, didn't omit a thing.
It is strange to stroll through a house that is as much a matter of fiction as it is of fact, even stranger to be told that the bedroom left front was probably Jamie's and the one right front probably Eugene's because "Jamie heard Mary moving around the spare room at 3 in the morning, then pausing to listen outside her sons' doors." The people who saved and restored Monte Cristo Cottage read "Long Day's Journey Into Night" with the attention due a map.
One can also read Monte Cristo Cottage for what it says about James O'Neill. The staircase's balusters, for instance, don't go all the way to the steps but to a rail paralleling the banister instead. That's a penny-pincher's trick. But the newel post is big and baronial. That befits the Count of Monte Cristo. Ceilings upstairs are low, whereas those downstairs -- the ones for show -- are fairly high. The kitchen, demolished after the family left, was more or less tacked on.
After the cottage was sold, Ella O'Neill got rid of the furniture. But because Eugene described the living room so precisely it was easy to duplicate. Wicker chair, an oak rocker with a leather seat, the green-shaded lamp: the furniture was, if not cheap now, cheap then. Today, when summer-house chic is construed as a clever use of castoffs, the living room is curiously attractive. In Ella's day, when the more conspicuous the consumption the better, it must have seemed to her little more than a boarding house. Actually, Monte Cristo provided little in the way of board. The Tyrones took meals in the dining room; the O'Neills usually dined at a boarding house down the street.
There is one object in the living room, however, that is definitely and definitively James O'Neill's: the stoneware crock, with his name on it, that was regularly filled with whisky from a local bar and waiting for him when he got off the train in New London. His sword, perhaps the one that made the frightening clang when he played Othello to Edwin Booth's Iago, is slung in its scabbard over a fireplace in the back parlor, which, together with the front parlor, is crowded with old photographs of New Londoners, many of them the unknowing sitters for Eugene's often angry dramatic portraits. There are old theater posters, too, of a posturing, handsome James O'Neill and old theater programs. His son's life in the theater is there as well, and so is the green wicker table that was the centerpiece of the first production of "Long Day's Journey."
Upstairs, the bedrooms are small and stingy, with Jamie's painted a color known as Poison Green -- poison because in an earlier era the paint could contain arsenic, presumably lethal to bugs and any child who thought to lick it. The paint on the wall now isn't laced with arsenic and maybe it wasn't in Jamie's day, either. Just the same, it is the color he woke to every morning and must have been hard on a hangover. Eugene's bedroom is furnished with the crude desk he later used in Provincetown and at which he wrote "Anna Christie" and "The Emperor Jones," and with a surprisingly handsome desk chair that is thought to be his. Down the hall is the bathroom, and in it the marble sink at which the O'Neills washed their faces and brushed their teeth.
O'Neill set another play, "Ah, Wilderness!," at Monte Cristo Cottage but it was about the kind of family he wished he'd been raised in, the McGinleys, rather than his own. Art McGinley was his closest childhood friend, and it was he, I believe, who once spoke at my college about his chum. A rotten audience I was, having seen only "Anna Christie" and that only because I was curious about Garbo. But a few weeks ago, I watched the 1935 film of "Ah, Wilderness!," and smiled to see not only the family O'Neill wished he had, but also the house the set designers wished he'd had. This was no Monte Cristo Cottage. This was Ella O'Neill's dream come true.
In a sense, Eugene O'Neill never left New London any more than James Joyce ever left Dublin. There are bits and pieces of the town and its people -- the Yankees who snubbed the O'Neills, the whores who slept with the boys, the drunks father and sons drank with and the seamen that Eugene set sail with -- throughout a lot of O'Neill's plays. Most of the family -- James, Ella, Jamie and little Edmund -- is still in town, in St. Mary's Cemetery. A taste for symmetry has me wishing that Eugene, who is buried in Boston, were, too. But, of course, he is.

Maybe Not on the High Road, but They Travel Well

BYLINE: By EMILY YELLIN 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
JON THOMPSON, DIRECTOR OF cultural affairs for the city of Memphis, faced a challenge in Beijing a few years ago. He had to persuade the Chinese Government to allow more than 250 relics and fine-art objects out of the country for almost three years. Worse, he had to explain that its cherished national treasures were not going to some world-renowned museum.
Instead, they were to be the heart of a touring blockbuster exhibition series called "Wonders," which would open at a convention center in downtown Memphis just a few miles from Elvis Presley's Graceland. The show would then go on to Portland, Ore.; Provo, Utah, and Denver before ending up in Orlando, Fla., just a few miles from Disney World. 
 But Mr. Thompson, a genteel Southerner who also happens to be a veteran marketing man, had his sales pitch ready. Knowing China was eager to win American admirers, he began by describing a "cultural corridor," running from New York to Washington, through Chicago and on to Los Angeles, saying it was in these cities that most major arts events occur in the United States.
"So why don't we create our own countercultural corridor," he suggested, "going from Oregon to Florida diagonally across the U.S. in the opposite direction?" The Chinese were sold.
As a result, "The Imperial Tombs of China" opened in Memphis in 1995. Last Thursday, the exhibition opened at the Orlando Museum of Art, the last leg of its planned five-city tour. More than 1.5 million people have seen the show so far.
Predictably, some members of America's museum establishment are not particularly receptive to Mr. Thompson's road show. In fact, the concept of the "Wonders" blockbuster runs so counter to their notions of high culture that they may never completely accept it.
"Wonders: The Memphis International Series," which Mr. Thompson heads, was started after the city sponsored an exhibition in 1987 called "Rameses the Great." It drew 675,000 people and went on to be seen by almost eight million people on an eight-city North American tour. Then came "Wonders" exhibitions on Catherine the Great, the Ottomans, the Etruscans, Napoleon and China, all staged in the Memphis convention center. The city's seventh blockbuster, "Titanic: The Exhibition," opened last month in the basement of Memphis's largest indoor sports arena, where it will remain through September.
The "Wonders" shows have even inspired a few spinoffs. James E. Broughton, the organization's original director, left Memphis and set up a similar series of three shows on Egypt, Russia and Greece in St. Petersburg, Fla. In Jackson, Miss., another former "Wonders" staffer, Jack Kyle, staged "The Palaces of St. Petersburg" in cooperation with Russia's Hermitage Museum last summer. Attendance was more than 550,000, second last year only to the Cezanne exhibition in Philadelphia.
Unlike blockbusters that are composed strictly of fine-arts objects, "Wonders" shows combine fine art, natural history and Smithsonian-like cultural history. Every exhibition is designed to make a strong emotional impact through elaborate sets and a story line. A free audio guide is narrated by a celebrity: Leonard Nimoy for the Chinese exhibition, Lauren Bacall for Catherine the Great. Non-art objects are often a big draw, too: bricks from the Great Wall of China, Catherine the Great's coronation carriage and every item in the art-free Titanic show, from jewelry and money to a steward's jacket and a jar of green olives.
"There is a real hunger for this kind of thing in second- and third-tier cities that do not have a Metropolitan Museum on their doorstep," Mr. Thompson said.
MANY FROM THE MUSEUM world are reluctant to dismiss the "Wonders" concept totally, but they express concern that the shows may warp the public's perception of what museum professionals do.
" 'Wonders' is a great draw for the city," said Kate Gooch, president of the Memphis Arts Council. "It is kind of the Boston Pops of art. But it is not a substitute for a museum."
Edward H. Able, president of the American Association of Museums, an organization of 3,000 museums across the country, also has reservations about the "Wonders" concept. "These are one-time events that come and go," he said. "They seem to be mostly entrepreneurial activities to make money, unlike museums, which are committed to continuing programs, education, scholarship and a broader and more complex mission."
Some museum officials are also troubled by the fact that "Wonders" is an arm of local government, not a museum. John Buchanan, director of the Portland Museum of Art in Oregon, said his museum took the China exhibition last summer because of its artistic value, but he noted that the idea of city bureaucrats initiating art exchanges raises questions. "The opening salvo in these negotiations came from the governments," he said. "And that was nervous-making to my colleagues, who are used to talking curator to curator."
But to city leaders, any doubts about the shows are overshadowed by the bottom line: the tourism they attract stimulates local economies. Even when a "Wonders" show operated at a loss, which some have, the city of Memphis still earned $3.54 in tax revenue for every dollar invested, a city study showed.
That is a major reason Memphis keeps the nonprofit series solvent through a revolving $4.2 million loan. Any profit from "Wonders" ticket- and gift-shop sales is funneled back into the next exhibition. Organizers keep the expenses low by using more than 2,000 volunteers and sharing costs with other cities on the tours.
For this and other reasons, the people behind "Wonders" and its spinoffs do not apologize for their efforts. Instead, they say their work complements that of museums, and they cite a number of reasons.
Not having a permanent museum collection, they say, enables them to focus all their resources on display. They pay fees for the works they borrow because the "Wonders" organization, unlike big museums, cannot trade on prestige or the promise of reciprocal loans.
Education is a built-in part of the concept. Free study guides are sent to every teacher in the area, and thousands of children are given free tours. Shows are staged in uncommon venues only when local museums do not have enough space to handle the large exhibitions and huge crowds.
Their most heartfelt defense is that the "Wonders" exhibitions do not commercialize art; they popularize it. "I'm a populist," said Mr. Kyle, the former "Wonders" staff member. "I believe art is for the people."
He and his colleagues argue that there is nothing wrong with bringing the exhibitions to people who may never be able to afford a trip to New York, much less Russia or China, or to those who find museums intimidating.
Cheryl Reddick, who drove 12 hours from Georgia with a friend to see the Titanic show, is one of those people. "Museums are too overwhelming," she said. "With 'Wonders' you can see the whole exhibit in a couple of hours."
If nothing else, the "Wonders" concept democratizes art, said J. Carter Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the creator of a blockbuster of his own last summer at the Olympics in Atlanta. "I think these exhibits challenge the idea that only the priesthood can see art and the great unwashed cannot," he said.
It's a view shared by Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who is credited with originating the blockbuster phenomenon when he brought the King Tut show to America in 1977. " 'Wonders' is a trailer-park blockbuster," he said. "But it's good. They reach a whole group of people who never got an art education, and it might end up drawing them into other museums. Half a generation from now, I bet there will be bunches of people who will remember 'Wonders' and say it is what got them interested in art as a child." He added, "The shows are great, not second-rate at all."
For each show, organizers recruit recognized experts to be guest curators. The Napoleon exhibit was curated by Bernard Chevallier, director of Malmaison in France, who gathered more than 175 pieces of art from 50 museums all over the world. "The people they get to curate are the top people in their fields," Mr. Hoving said.
FOR ALL THE SUCCESS OF these shows, however, a "Wonders" exhibition can still be a risky proposition. St. Petersburg is struggling with an $11 million loss on its series, mainly because of lower-than-expected attendance and a financial arrangement in which much of the gift-shop revenue went to Mr. Broughton, the original "Wonders" director, instead of to the city.
Mr. Broughton has left to form an independent company to produce similar shows for other cities. His next show will be called "Nicholas and Alexandra." Meanwhile, in Memphis, an exhibition of several hundred ancient Peruvian treasures will open next spring. An exhibition from Versailles is set for next summer in Jackson. And cities like Topeka, Kan., and Wilmington, Del., have discussed beginning their own series.
Despite challenges and naysayers, the "Wonders" concept persists. "The elitist crowd has some valid points of criticism," said Mr. Hoving. "But these shows are going to keep coming."

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
The Asian Con, Part 2

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's, i sat on a Wall Street trading floor and watched the Japanese stampede the United States Treasury bond market. "How now long bond?" the customer from Tokyo would ask; the American bond salesman would giggle and then sell to him or buy from him staggering amounts of our national debt. The losses suffered by the Japanese in this activity were breathtaking. Every time the American bond market moved, it seemed, Japan lost a month's worth of trade surpluses. The American bond salesman could see this and, as a result, he was not so frightened by Japan's financial clout. Some part of him grasped that the Japanese were partly mad, and that their behavior doomed them to financial oblivion.
But to most Americans this was not so clear, perhaps because most Americans are predisposed to thinking of themselves as the innocents of global culture. When Japanese businessmen took to buying prime Manhattan real estate (Rockefeller Center!) and Hollywood studios (cultural heritage!) and famous golf courses (Pebble Beach!) the American reaction bordered on hysteria. 
 The fear was understandable; for a while it did appear that Japan might have concocted a more powerful economy than anything the United States had ever seen. But the fear was also misplaced, for it turned out that it was the Japanese who were being royally fleeced. All of Japan's most scandalous purchases ended in tears; many of them ended back in American hands. And no wonder. The Japanese had dealt almost exclusively with the most shrewd, ruthless, money-obsessed people on earth: American investment bankers, real-estate moguls and movie executives.
These days the irrational fear of Japanese money is mainly gone, though you can still read the occasional article about Japan's tendency to prevent American automobile manufacturers from selling their big sedans to Tokyo motorists. (German car manufacturers don't seem to have such complaints, but you don't hear much about that.) The fear of Japan, Inc., has been replaced by an irrational fear of Chinese campaign donations. The flow of funds out of China -- and Taiwan, Indonesia and Singapore -- into American politics has generated something of the same thoughtless response as the flow of funds out of Japan into the American economy. Just as we should have celebrated the Japanese for overpaying for our Treasury bonds, real estate, golf courses and film studios, we should be cheering the Chinese for overpaying for Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign.
That any politician must go around with a wheelbarrow begging cash from rich people is a scandal, of course. But as long as politicians must do this, far better that they do it abroad than at home.
First consider Bill Clinton. No President has ever been less likely to reward his supporters and friends -- a virtue when they want something they shouldn't have. Clinton is notoriously disloyal; he has turned betrayal into a political art form, and his natural inclination is simply to do what is best for his career.
And to further his career, Clinton needed -- or felt he needed -- to come up with millions to pay for television ads. Every dollar he turned away from China -- or Indonesia or Singapore -- was a dollar he would have had to raise from rich Americans, and their corporations.
The corporate raider Carl Lindner, who usually gives to Republicans, quietly donated more than $500,000 to state Democratic Parties in the last seven months of the Clinton campaign. As it happens, Carl Lindner wanted the Clinton Administration to argue the case for his (multinational) company, Chiquita Brands, in front of the World Trade Organization.
You can be sure that Lindner will be upset if he doesn't get what he wants. More to the point, you can be sure that he will find ways to punish the Democrats for neglecting his concerns. He can help turn other rich Americans against them. Rich Americans can forgive a President who takes money from a Chinese operative without doing something in return. But to take money so ruthlessly from a rich American -- that's a sin.
Now consider the poor Chinese, who forked over millions -- and for what? There's not much that a President can do for China -- or Taiwan or Indonesia -- without it ending up on the front page. More important, there is not much that the Chinese can do to Clinton if he stiffs them. It is easier for Clinton to indulge his inherent ingratitude when his supporters are: 1) 5,000 miles away, 2) a potential enemy of the country and 3) easily hoodwinked about American political customs: "Sorry, it will make things even worse for you if we are seen to be on your side." Indeed, of all the foreigners Clinton might have sought money from, the Chinese posed the least threat to the public interest precisely because it is so difficult to reward them.
The election laws that forbid politicians to accept contributions from foreigners make it difficult -- but not impossible -- for the Chinese to pay for our campaigns. Maybe we should change the laws and save ourselves a little money.
We are the masters of the Asian con who somehow manage to persuade ourselves that it is we who are being conned. You can be sure that the fiercest outrage during the coming hearings of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will be directed at Asian money, and the people who asked for it. The list of those most likely to be interrogated gives you an idea of how the story will play out: James T. Riady and John Huang of the Lippo Group; Charles Yah Lin Trie; Pauline Kanchanalak, among others.
This fear of Asians isn't all bad. If riding a few Asians out of Washington on a rail helps to generate public support for campaign finance reform, well then, hitch up the ponies. Giddyap! But you can't help feeling a bit sorry for the poor Chinese suckers. They should have learned their lesson from the Japanese.

HEADLINE: The Best Seller of Byzantium

BYLINE: By Fernanda Eberstadt; Fernanda Eberstadt is a novelist and essayist. Her most recent novel, "When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth," has just been published.

 BODY:
Orhan Pamuk is sitting in his study on a hill overlooking Istanbul. Before him gleams the Bosporus, panning into the Sea of Marmara. On one shore lies the Greek-Ottoman Old City, with its sultans' palaces and Byzantine cathedral-turned-mosque. The other shore is Asia, shipyards and lighthouses. And at Pamuk's feet, cargo ships from Turkey's ancestral enemy Russia are parked in the harbor, disgorging traders from the ex-Soviet bloc who, since the collapse of Communism, have helped make Istanbul once again a multinational boom town.
Pamuk, lanky as an adolescent, graced with the almond eyes and mischievous smile of a Persian miniature, surveys this humming, jeweled city whose millennial complexities his fiction elaborates. Slyly, he says, "When I write, I take off my glasses so I can't see." 
 At 44, Orhan Pamuk is, as he reminds you with a characteristic mixture of provocation and naivete, very famous." His novels -- erudite, formally experimental yet compulsively readable -- have won him an international esteem unprecedented for a Turk. (His sole predecessor, Yashar Kemal, author of "Mehmed, My Hawk," writes tales of the Anatolian outback.) His books have been translated into 15 languages and are published by the most prestigious houses to critical glory: his latest novel,
"The New Life," just out from Farrar, Straus & Giroux, has been acclaimed by some American reviewers for the brilliance of its "post-modern metaphysics," "mesmerizing prose" and "Borgesian chiaroscuro."
But if Pamuk in the West enjoys a respectfully "literary" reputation, in his own country he is a rabble-rousing blockbuster. His five novels have each in turn sat at the top of the best-seller list in Turkey -- a nation not previously known for its serious readers. ("The New Life" at last tally had sold 200,000 copies.) Pirated editions of Pamuk's works are hawked from Istanbul street stalls; his appearance at Turkish human rights events attracts television crews; every morning he is in the newspapers being asked his opinion about the country's new Islamist Prime Minister or the threat of a military coup.
Pamuk's artistic accomplishment has been to play West against East, using the European novel's modernist tradition of formal experimentation in order to explore both his country's tangled Ottoman past and its contemporary politico-religious extremes. His books, which interleave Proustian family sagas with dervish allegories and reportage on modern-day paramilitary cults, have roused a furor in Turkey. Older Turkish intellectuals bred on Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's secularist dogma accuse him of playing with religion; Islamists accuse him of blasphemy; old-time leftists accuse him of cashing in. And meanwhile, Pamuk's new prominence in the Kurdish rights movement and his opposition to the police brutality and harsh penal codes that keep Turkey an authoritarian state threaten to alienate his popular audience. "Columnists write, 'He is a best seller; now he's selling his country,' " Pamuk says with amusement. "If you do something new in Turkey, they look at you as a pervert. The future can only come from America."
 Orhan pamuk is singularly well positioned to become the chronicler of his country's imperial neuroses. Turkey, after all, is not a conventionally third world country but a superpower that once stretched from Baghdad to the gates of Vienna, and Pamuk's own family history exemplifies in microcosm Turkey's efficient transition from a multiethnic empire to a modern nation-state.
The Pamuks belonged to Turkey's French-educated haute bourgeoisie of civil servants, law professors, businessmen. Orhan's mother's family was an old Istanbul clan of textile manufacturers; his father's father was a civil engineer who made a fortune in the 20's, when the new republic poured money into railroads. "Both Faulkner's grandfather and mine built railways," jokes Pamuk over a cup of tea in his office on a slushy January afternoon.
Pamuk grew up in an Istanbul apartment building built by his paternal grandfather and inhabited by an extended clutter of aunts, uncles, cousins -- a communal life of gossip, cards, tobacco, radio whose cultivated languors his novels elegize. The railwayman's sons, both engineers, went into various real-estate schemes, Pamuk tells me. "They were unsuccessful, I am sorry to say. All my childhood, I remember my grandmother crying, crying because this apartment building, that apartment building had been sold. My father would disappear to Paris and not call home for four days. In 10, 15 years, he and my uncle had wasted their father's money," Orhan recalls, laughing. "Today, nothing is left." His parents are divorced.
Orhan and his older brother, Sevket, were educated at the elite English-language Robert College. Sevket is today an Ottoman economic historian at the University of Bosporus. Orhan, who was expected to be an engineer, went on to study architecture -- "a prestigious, respected thing to do." The American novelist Maureen Freely, who knew Orhan in high school, says: "He was a good Ottoman boy. But then a screw went loose in his head." Orhan dropped out of architecture school and began writing novels. For years, nothing was published. This "dark" age recurs in Pamuk's talk as his formative calvary.
"When I was 22, I locked myself in my bedroom for eight years. You know Hawthorne? I was that kind of person, solitary, strange. People thought, oh, he's a failure. Once every three years my mother opened my bedroom door and said, 'Maybe you should apply to medical school.' Instead, I tore Repin's portraits of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky out of a book and hung them on my wall."
In 1980, Turkey underwent one of its once-a-decade military coups, and Pamuk shelved a Conradian novel about a cadre of student revolutionaries who throw a bomb at the Prime Minister. Two years later -- the same year that he married his wife, Aylin, an Ottoman historian from a White Russian family -- his novel "Cevdet Bey and His Sons" appeared, to enormous success. A second novel, "The Silent House," a multigenerational saga of an Ottoman-republican family, was published in France by Gallimard.
It was with his third novel that Orhan Pamuk won truly international fame. "The White Castle," set in the 1690's at the outset of Ottoman decline, is an allegory of two look-alikes. A Venetian aristocrat, captured by pirates, is indentured to a Turkish inventor known only as Hoja (Master). Hoja, voracious for Western science, picks his Other's brain for knowledge of "them" -- Westerners -- and what "they" know. When Hoja and his Venetian servant, who have invented a war machine, join the Sultan's army on its siege of a white castle in southern Poland, the men swap identities. Hoja escapes to Venice, while the Venetian retires to Anatolian exile. Or does he? Who is really who?
"The White Castle" introduces the doppelganger theme that haunts Pamuk's work. "There's this other person who is always in a more genuine, more heartfelt, more hard-core place than you," Pamuk explains. "Even his failures are more authentic. You love him and you also want to kill him. These are my essential subjects: rivalry, jealousy, problems of domination and influence, revenge. Crucial but unworthy issues that come from growing up in an exclusively competitive childhood with a brother only 18 months older than I, and also of living on the margins of Europe. Turning around this feeling of off-centeredness. Saying, no, I am at the center. My contribution to the doppelganger problem was to give it an East-West tilt."
"The New Life" pushes even further the poignant, where-do-we-belong dialectic of isolationism and imitation that has plagued modern Turks. Its student hero has been transfigured by reading a book whose identity we never learn. In pursuit of the "new life" it reveals, he sets out on a bus ride across Turkey's Asian hinterland. Pamuk feelingly evokes the paranoid weirdness of provincial Turkey -- like America, a big, sparsely populated country where housewives, self-made millionaires and retired colonels meet in messianic conspiracies.
 We are sitting in pamuk's study. Outside is early darkness, fog and sleet, the reek of brown coal smoke. You can barely glimpse the big ships slinking along the Bosporus. It's Ramadan, and at the evening prayer call the holiday fairy lights bedecking the mosque next door are illuminated like a department store at Christmas.
Inside, Pamuk's office is a cozy sanctuary of floor-to-ceiling books behind old-fashioned glass breakfronts. In the middle sit two Art Deco desks -- one his grandfather's, the other his wife's grandfather's -- draped in green baize, at which Pamuk writes his novels by pen, in a large, legible hand. You have stepped into another century. Time is punctuated only by the prayer call and the fax machine, the latter bringing queries from Pamuk's foreign translators and invitations to international writers' congresses.
Pamuk and I are sitting on matching chintz armchair and sofa, facing the city. We have been talking for four days straight, 10, 11 hours a day. Sometimes we snatch a pot of tea from the kitchen, a handful of anise rusks. The K.G.B.-interrogation-style schedule is a tribute to Pamuk's compulsiveness: when his weary interviewer suggests a break, Pamuk says, "No, no, let's continue work." He is no stranger to obsessiveness, he admits -- it's the demon that keeps him productive. "Look, I work seven days a week, from 9 in the morning till 8 at night. I have the titles of the next eight novels I want to write. I feel myself pitiable, degraded on a day that I don't write. Turks -- who are all born poets, God is whispering in their ear -- have a dismissive phrase: he works like a clerk. I have turned this insult around: I am proud to say that I work like a clerk."
Pamuk claims he has no social life, rarely goes out, avoids the nights of raki-drinking that are a staple of Istanbul literary life. "I am not a worshiper of pagan happiness. I don't have a sunny family life; I prefer to be here in my office. Recently I discovered Elias Canetti, who says: 'It's not that I don't care about going to parties or meeting girls -- it's that the impact is too great. After one party, I can't work for two weeks.' The more uneventful the life, the more material there is. Events kill the imagination. You know Flaubert said, 'The fewer erections, the better the writing.' "
What substitutes for live encounters is the world of books -- for Pamuk, the "great consolation." His reading is feverish, encyclopedic; he cross-questions visitors about favorite authors like a boy trading baseball cards. The Contemporary American section of his library looks like a plugged-in New Yorker's shelves -- not just one but three volumes each by Mona Simpson, Harold Brodkey, Nicholson Baker.
Turkish intellectuals, while extolling Pamuk's technical virtuosity, frequently remark that his novels are "bookish." The translator Yurdanur Salman complains that Pamuk's fiction is "dry, cerebral, not a juicy, organic text." The Turkish literary critic Jale Parla notes, "His source of inspiration has been more literature than life."
Are European novels unreservedly part of his inheritance, I ask Pamuk, or does he read Joyce and Flaubert with more ambivalence than, say, an American might? Those in the "provinces" of world culture suffer from a "double consciousness," Pamuk answers. "In movie houses in Istanbul, growing up, we devoured Hollywood dramas as guides to etiquette. There would be a love scene in a restaurant, and someone in the back row would shout, 'Look, they're eating peaches with a knife and fork!' And the whole audience would go, 'Aha!'
"Things in Turkey are not shiny like in the West. There is a feeling of being off the track, forgotten. I have given so much time and energy to exploring that sadness of feeling that the life lived elsewhere is more mythic, more real than your own pale, shabby imitation-life."
This provincial curse of isolation is especially potent in the Turks' case because they were deliberately cut off from their own formidable history. After the Ottoman defeat in the First World War and the consequent dismemberment of the empire, Kemal Ataturk created the new republic in the West's image. All "Eastern" traces, including religion, were banned as backward. Ataturk outlawed the dervish sects, introduced the Latin alphabet and purged Turkish of its Arabic and Persian words. As a result, contemporary Turks cannot read their own classical texts, including a poem a hundred years old.
On the up side, Ataturk made a proud nation of a conquered remnant, offering the sole proof of a secular Muslim democracy. On the down side, he left a people with an enduring identity crisis. "Mentally trying to join another civilization, whether because of technology or a military defeat, is painful," says Pamuk. "I was raised in a community that considered itself to be Western, while the rest of the country did not seem to be. Religion for us was low culture." His sole encounter with Islam, growing up, was being taken to the mosque by the maid. "It was a place where the servants met to gossip, and I was so Westernized I felt naked taking off my shoes. This back and forth of having believed yourself to be Western, then realizing you're different; your naive way of ignoring these differences, then eventually trying to establish your own place -- this is not some metaphysical gymnastic. The whole country is suffering through the same dilemma. The simplest municipal problem -- how to design street lights or parking meters -- becomes part of the East-West debate. Then you understand that this transition state has been going on for 200 years; it is a way of life and will be for years to come."
It is this forced disenfranchisement, Pamuk suggests, that has fueled the country's rising fundamentalism, giving the Islamist Welfare Party the plurality of the national vote: "Ataturk repressed the lively heterogeneity of Ottoman Turkey's many Muslim sects." Until recently, Pamuk would have said that the growing religiosity you see among Turkey's middle classes was the normal expression of a moderate faith reasserting itself after decades of government repression. Now he's not so complacent. The sign of Islam's takeover: "Today even our scandals are religious scandals!" he jokes, referring to a dervish sect whose arrested leader has been accused of entering into one-night "marriages" with nubile proselytes.
It is Orhan Pamuk's novelistic mission both to capture the geographical schism in the Turkish soul and to reconcile it, planting Arabic and Persian words, images and stories in a Western form. His enterprise is by no means instinctual: "I have three generations of positivist blood in me; the geography of my literary heritage began with Henry James. Hegel defines 'the contingent' as that which exists but is not necessary. In my early 20's I kicked out of my fictional project anything with Islamic origins. It was only later I realized that classical Sufi literature not only existed but was necessary. I like Faulkner's describing how in his 20's he tried to write French novels, and in his 30's he turned to Mississippi. I, too, finally understood that my huge stem of a civilization was interesting, and that the whole tradition was still alive in Istanbul. To search out this civilization in broken walls, in broken faces, became my highest challenge."
 Tonight pamuk is having dinner with his old friend Jeri Laber, a senior adviser to Human Rights Watch, and several leading Turkish human rights activists. On earlier occasions I have seen him play the enfant terrible, quick-fire, high-strung, brilliantly volatile. Tonight he is all unobtrusive diplomacy, bent on making sure, invisibly, that everybody is happy.
Jeri Laber is in Istanbul for the trial of a publisher and a translator who were charged with violating Article 159.1 of the penal code, which forbids "defamation or belittling of the state security forces." The "defamation" occurred in their translation of a Human Rights Watch report, in which an unnamed United States Embassy official is quoted as referring to the Turkish Army's Special Teams, who are fighting Kurdish rebels in the southeast, as "thugs." (In the end, they received light, symbolic sentences.) There are dozens of laws in Turkey limiting freedom of expression, I am told, including those against "thoughts inconsistent with Turkey's historical values." Tonight's guests would like to see each one junked.
Pamuk, too, is involved in his own trial. This second trial involves a recently issued anthology of articles, each of which on its original publication was charged with breaking a law. Now more than a thousand people, including Orhan, have declared themselves "editors," making the anthology's publication "the largest act of civil disobedience in Turkey." If its participants are jailed, many of Turkey's most popular soap operas, music programs and newspapers will shut down.
Tonight's guests include Semra Somersan and Sanar Yurdatapan, both veterans in Turkey's human rights struggle. Yurdatapan and Orhan make a curious contrast: Yurdatapan, a hard-living, grizzled musician, movie-star handsome, has just come out of prison for the umpteenth time and seems determined to go straight back in; Orhan is self-parodically cautious, always playing the angles. Orhan and Jeri Laber are both politely making sure that the Western luminaries they hope will come for the anthology trial don't also end up in a Turkish clink.
We are dining at a White Russian restaurant, and the evening is very jolly: the whiff of prison makes everybody giggly. We drink vodka and stay till the faded blond cashier casts voodoo looks to make us go home. When we part, Yurdatapan heads for the bus station, where it turns out he is taking a midnight bus to Ankara: a six-hour flirtation with death on mountain roads that would make most teen-agers blanch. (Three months later he was back in custody.)
The next day, when I drop by Pamuk's office to say goodbye, he asks me what I made of the previous evening. We perform a post-mortem, Pamuk omnisciently decoding the delicate diplomacy at work between the American and the Turkish contingents. "Last night was bad for my writing," he admits. "Day-to-day involvement in a country's brutal politics kills the creator's soul, slowly, slowly.
"Turkey is a savage country; there is no understanding for other religious, ethnic, linguistic communities. If Jesus Christ were a Turkish policeman, he would be corrupted within 10 months. Every day shameful scandals are exposed in the newspapers, but nothing changes. I want to live in a society in which people don't get arrested for their thoughts."
I ask him, as dusk falls on the marine expanse of lighthouses and minarets, if he might live elsewhere -- expecting, I guess, for Pamuk to swear, if I forget thee, O Istanbul, let my right hand wither. I am surprised by his alacrity. Yes, he could easily move to New York or Paris. "With guilty conscience, but it's an author's job to transfer his work. I admire James Joyce in Trieste, carrying within himself the dramatic weight of Ireland. All of us Turkish intellectuals have moments of exile, feeling estranged by the coups or by this new fundamentalism. My first thought is always, how will I take my library?"

HEADLINE: THE RENTOCRACY;
At the INTERSECTION of Supply and Demand

BYLINE: By John Tierney 

 BODY:
If you want to know why you can't find a decent apartment in new york city, a good place to start is at East Second Street and Avenue B. But it's important not to be deceived by appearances, because at first glance this intersection seems to be an advertisement for the supposed renaissance of New York. It can lure you into thinking that the Lower East Side, built and rebuilt by generations of immigrants, is being revived once again.
During the 1980's, this intersection was one of the most notorious drug markets on the East Coast. As dealers' armed sentries looked down from surrounding roofs, hundreds of customers bargained in the street and retired to shooting galleries in the abandoned gas station and burned-out tenements. 
 "Every day I'd clean up the syringes on the sidewalk and hose down the blood and vomit," recalls Mary Spink, the superintendent of the building on the southwest corner. "I tried to be cool when I found junkies shooting up on the stoop. I'd say, 'Hey, could you do your thing somewhere else?' But one Sunday morning, when six of them were lying on the stoop and wouldn't move, I finally snapped." Spink went inside and returned with a baseball bat imbedded with razor blades.
"I stood on the sidewalk swinging the bat in a circle over my head, and I made an announcement: 'Men, women and children, the blood shed today will be the last blood shed on this stoop.' That got them to move. It helped me for a while afterward because the junkies were never sure if I was crazy or not."
Today Mary Spink has a lot more allies. The tenements next door have been renovated, and the factory across the street has been turned into lofts. A six-story apartment building is rising on the site of the old gas station, and a trattoria has moved in next to it. Old-timers complain that the intersection has become a too-fashionable destination. Japanese designers, Pakistani Web-site managers, British writers, Chilean artists -- a new generation of immigrants is eager to move into the neighborhood created last century by impoverished Irish, Germans, Poles, Ukranians and Russians.
But there's a problem. Most of these new immigrants have no hope of finding a place to live, certainly nothing in which they could hope to raise a family. Rents are about $1,200 for the few one-bedroom apartments on the open market; the lofts go for $2,800. There are plenty of cheap subsidized and rent-regulated apartments around, but these rarely become available, and to get one you generally have to know someone or spend years on a waiting list.
A building rehabilitated with money from the city has $600-a-month one-bedroom apartments set aside for artists. A subsidized two-bedroom apartment rents for $44 a month. A $93-a-month one-bedroom rent-controlled apartment has been empty in recent months because its tenant has been at his Florida home, but he's not about to give up the lease.
New York used to be like other cities, a place where tenants moved frequently and landlords competed to rent empty apartments to newcomers, but today the motto may as well be: No Immigrants Need Apply. While immigrants are crowded into bunks in illegal boarding houses in the slums, upper-middle-class locals pay low rents to live in good neighborhoods, often in large apartments they no longer need after their children move out. Half a century of rent regulation has created a permanent shortage of decent homes by keeping apartments off the market and encouraging landlords to neglect their buildings. The shortage isn't being eased by new apartments, because developers have been frightened away by the rent regulations and stifled by a host of other restrictions.
"We're building less today than during the Depression," says Peter Salins, who analyzed the city's housing shortage in a recent report for the Manhattan Institute. "New York has the nation's most pervasive rent-regulatory system, the most complex zoning ordinance and environmental regulations and the most costly building code. Each of these intrusions would be quite enough to thwart a vital housing market. In combination they're fatal."
Rent regulation, ardently denounced by liberal as well as conservative economists, housing experts and editorial writers, is just as ardently defended by the city's politicians. But this year an upstate Republican, Senator Joseph Bruno, the majority leader of the state Senate, is threatening to dismantle the programs that control prices and guarantee tenure and other rights to tenants occupying a third of the city's dwellings, chiefly the one million apartments in the rent-stabilization program ("The Case for Rent Regulation," page 43). Another 70,000 apartments with long-term residents are part of an older rent-control system, but most of these will still be regulated if Bruno fulfills his pledge to extend protections for the elderly, the disabled and the poor. The rent regulations, which have always been justified as "emergency" measures, will expire June 15 unless they're renewed by the Legislature. Tenants are furiously protesting -- Bruno has received death threats -- and Governor Pataki is expected to have to broker a last-minute compromise, possibly one that would remove protections from some affluent tenants and then gradually deregulate other apartments as tenants die or move.
Although rent regulation is often defended as essential protection for the poor throughout the city, it disproportionately benefits the middle and upper classes in Manhattan. In other boroughs, the median rent of stabilized apartments is only about $100 less than the median rent for unregulated apartments, and regulated apartments tend to be smaller and more run-down.
Two-thirds of the citywide benefits of rent regulation go to Manhattanites living below 96th Street, according to Henry O. Pollakowski, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Real Estate. The results of his new peer-reviewed study, which was financed by the Rent Stabilization Association, a group of landlords, are similar to those of a 1991 study for the Citizens Budget Commission by Elizabeth Roistacher, an economist at Queens College. In comparing the benefits received by rent-regulated tenants, she found that upper-income households receive greater subsidies on average than low-income households and that the average white household saves almost three times as much as the average black household.
Most of the good deals go to people with above-average incomes in Manhattan's best neighborhoods. Pollakowski has found that the greatest beneficiaries of rent regulation live on the Upper West Side, where the median household income in typical rent-stabilized apartments -- one-bedrooms -- is $50,000 a year, which is $30,000 more than the median household income in rentals citywide. The median household income is higher still, $61,000, in unregulated one-bedrooms on the Upper West Side, but that's partly because more of them are shared by two people. Per person, rent-stabilized tenants' income is only about $2,500 less than their unregulated neighbors'. The big difference is that because their median rent is $420 lower, they spend only 18 percent of their income on rent. The unregulated tenants spend 23 percent and still typically need a roommate.
Deregulation would force today's rent-stabilized tenants on the Upper West Side to spend more, but not as much as they fear, because market prices would fall the most in the neighborhoods where they're highest today. Pollakowski estimates that the market price of apartments on the Upper West Side would decline by 30 percent. Other economists have come up with different figures, but there's general agreement that market prices can only go down. "New Yorkers don't believe prices will fall, but it's a standard economic principle," says Pollakowski, who is the editor of the Journal of Housing Economics. "Today's prices of unregulated apartments have been artificially pushed up because there are so few on the market. Renters looking for apartments that aren't rent-stabilized on the Upper West Side today are bidding against one another for only 4,000 one-bedrooms. If you suddenly flooded the market with the 25,000 rent-stabilized one-bedrooms in the neighborhood, the price would fall even if no one left the neighborhood."
Any reduction in today's inflated prices would help immigrants, but even outright elimination of rent regulation wouldn't be enough to solve the city's long-term housing shortage. New York will stagnate unless something is done about another problem that you see around Second and B.
 Actually, the problem is what you don't see. The neighborhood abounds with vacant lots where tenements used to stand. The properties have been empty so long that people have started using them as junkyards, parking lots and community gardens. Some have been planted with rows of corn. In the middle of America's most densely populated city, during a severe housing shortage, prime residential real estate has been converted to . . . farmland.
Those cornstalks, not the Empire State Building, are the symbol of modern New York, the city that no longer builds. The city is losing homes three times faster than it's getting new ones. During the 1990's, only about 6,000 housing units per year have been added to the city. To keep up with population growth and to replace homes deteriorated beyond repair, Peter Salins estimates that the city needs at least 20,000, preferably 40,000, new homes a year.
Local politicians like to blame the shrinking supply of housing on the city's fiscal problems and cutbacks in Federal aid, because it's assumed that housing development here must be subsidized for all but the affluent. To recoup the cost of a small new apartment a developer would have to charge at least $900 to $1,200 a month in rent -- half the median income of New York tenants. The conventional wisdom is that New York's housing shortage is really an "income problem."
The conventional wisdom makes sense unless you look at the empty lots near Second and B and ask a simple question: Who paid for the tenements and middle-class apartments that used to stand there?
At the end of the last century, when the Lower East Side was being developed, the average monthly per-capita income in America was equivalent to about $250 in today's dollars, less than what a welfare recipient now gets. Yet over the course of a few decades developers created splendid neighborhoods all over the city: working-class apartments in Alphabet City, brownstones on Strivers' Row in Harlem and solid middle-class apartments on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, along Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn and in Jackson Heights, Queens.
New York's developers managed to house all social classes without government subsidies. At the turn of the century the Lower East Side was much more densely populated than it is today, but developers could afford to buy land, put up apartments, pay property taxes and still make a profit by charging reasonable rents. Immigrant workers in sweatshops had to spend only a quarter of their income to rent a one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartment.
Today a blue-collar immigrant can't afford a new apartment even when the developer gets the land free. To make housing affordable, government agencies routinely donate the site, pay for the construction or rehabilitation of apartments, exempt the building from property taxes and then provide still more subsidies.
Developers today are not stupider or greedier than those a century ago. The reason they don't build anymore is that it has essentially been outlawed. "We all want affordable housing, but we've made it impossible through the phenomenal steady increase in development costs," says Louis Winnick, a scholar of New York housing and vice chairman of the Institute of Public Administration. "When the first model tenement was built by a philanthropist last century, it took 11 months to design and build from the time the land was acquired. Today you couldn't get your first building permit in 11 months. Probably the single most expensive factor is union labor -- with the work rules and $55-an-hour workers, you can't build an affordable hut -- but the problem isn't any one thing. It's the combination of all the little rules that makes even nonunion projects prohibitively expensive."
Ever since Jacob Riis described the Lower East Side tenements in "How the Other Half Lives" a century ago, New York has been home to the country's most dedicated housing reformers. It has passed more laws, built more homes and spent far more money on housing than any other city. The reformers meant well and did some admirable things, but their legacy is a housing shortage and a system that discriminates against the young, the poor, the nonwhite and above all against the new.
"New York has the oldest-living housing shortage because it has a terrible fear of change," says George Sternlieb, a housing consultant and former director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "Today, New Yorkers would rather cling to a sinking ship than swim to a better one." Tenants are understandably worried about any change in the system, because no one wants to look for an apartment in the current market. It's been distorted so long that most New Yorkers can't imagine what the city could be: a place with better homes and better neighborhoods, a place where you could find a new home in an afternoon instead of being stuck in an apartment for life. It could even be a place where most tenants and landlords got along, incredible as that may sound.
Today it seems perfectly natural that the Broadway production acclaimed as the most realistic portrayal of modern New York is a passionate opera about a landlord-tenant dispute. "Rent" faithfully depicts the popular mood, although the plot does include one glaring implausibility. To retaliate against his tenants, who haven't paid rent in a year for their loft on Avenue B, the landlord summarily locks them out. That could never happen on the real Avenue B, as Mendel Wolf discovered at great expense.
 In 1986, when he was living in the old factory building on the southeast corner of Second and B, Mendel Wolf naively thought that buying it would be a simple way to get himself a home and an artist's studio. Wolf was an Israeli immigrant who had come to New York to be an artist and ended up supporting himself as a contractor. With the help of partners, he paid $725,000 for the building and planned to renovate it himself to meet residential specifications. The only other occupants of the building, which had a 1,600-square-foot loft on each floor, were an investment banker and a photographer who shared one floor. Wolf agreed to abide by the loft law, one of the city's various rent-regulation programs. "I thought I was promising them the right to stay there at their current rent, $1,000 a month," he says.
The tenants, however, soon had a different rent in mind: $0. The photographer, Ben Buchanan, says that Wolf made an oral promise that they could live rent-free. "There were so many problems with the building -- there'd often be no heat and hot water -- that we agreed we wouldn't have to pay rent until he finished bringing it up to code," Buchanan says. The investment banker, John Levin, declines to discuss the situation except to say, "The loft law gave extraordinary rights to tenants and assured employment for lawyers."
When Wolf took them to Housing Court, a judge ruled that he couldn't sue for nonpayment of rent because he hadn't demonstrated that the building complied with the standards of the loft law. "It was like being forced to live with a guest who empties your refrigerator and never pays for anything," Wolf says. He considered them squatters, and he was still enough of an out-of-towner to be astonished at their legal protection.
But in one sense much of New York has become a city of squatters: unwanted tenants occupying the property of landlords who would like to get rid of them. The situation brings out the worst in both sides. In a normal housing market both the landlord and the tenant have incentives to be responsible because they know the other has the power to retaliate. Before rent regulation and the permanent housing shortage, New York tenants played landlords off against one another. Jacob Riis wrote about how tenement dwellers got rent decreases by threatening to move, and how one landlord lured away another's tenants by sprucing up his building. In 1916, when the vacancy rate in the city was nearly 6 percent, landlords were stuck with tens of thousands of empty tenements whose occupants had found better homes. In the 1930's, when the vacancy rate remained above 10 percent, landlords on the Lower East Side routinely offered a month's free rent to attract tenants.
Today's tenants and landlords are helplessly stuck with one another. Rent-regulated tenants can't move because they'll never find such cheap apartments on the open market, and landlords can't throw them out because tenants and sometimes their heirs have legal rights to remain in perpetuity. New York has created a peculiar version of landed gentry, a rentocracy that has included much of the city's establishment. Some of the more famous rentocrats -- like Mia Farrow, who was paying less than $2,300 a month for the 11-room apartment overlooking Central Park that was featured in the film "Hannah and Her Sisters" -- have lost their deals because of the "luxury decontrol" reform three years ago championed by Senator Bruno, which affects some tenants making more than $250,000 a year. But Alistair Cooke still has his eight-room $2,078-a-month apartment on Fifth Avenue with a park view, and Manfred Ohrenstein, who protected rent regulation when he was minority leader of the State Assembly, pays $2,924 for 11 rooms on Central Park West. By law, rentrocrats are supposed to live in their apartments, but many don't. Nat Sherman, the owner of the tobacco store on Fifth Avenue, explained two decades ago to the journalist Ken Auletta why he didn't feel guilty about paying $400 for six rooms on Central Park South: "I use the apartment so little that I think it's fair."
The most privileged rentocrats cling to their family manses with Scarlett O'Hara's tenacity -- in fact, with even more tenacity, because their war never ends. Their enemy is in charge of maintaining the place. Some landlords have emptied apartments by setting fires or inviting drug dealers into a building; others have hired thugs to terrorize tenants. Even the best landlords purposely discriminate against rent-regulated tenants.
Arthur Zabarkes, until recently the director of the Real Estate Institute at New York University, recalls establishing a caste system in the Manhattan buildings he once managed: "At unregulated apartments we'd do most things that the tenants requested. But on the rent-regulated units, we did absolutely only what the law required. It was sad. There were people with 15-amp fuses from 1947 that couldn't handle an air conditioner, but we weren't legally required to replace them, so we didn't. We had a perverse incentive to make those tenants unhappy. With regulated apartments, the ultimate objective is to get people out of the building."
Since New York's tenants have lost their economic leverage against landlords, they must rely on the most complex tenant-protection laws in America. Wolf has a carton with thousands of pages of documents from his eight-year battle. After he lost his attempt to collect rent, the tenants filed complaints that he was skimping on service, threatening them and calling them "creeps and thieves." The tenants accused him of not providing heat; Wolf said he had been denied heat in his apartment because the tenants had broken the boiler by setting the thermostat at 90 degrees. There was long testimony about minor disputes. "Once we put up a doorbell for ourselves," Buchanan recalls, "and he pulled it out, so we pulled out the wires to his doorbell." Wolf accused them of filing false complaints and obstructing his efforts to renovate their apartment so that they could go on living rent-free. In 1992, five years after Wolf bought the building, a change in the loft law finally gave him the right to collect rent, but it took more court battles to actually collect the money.
In 1994, Wolf went to court accusing Buchanan, the only remaining tenant on the lease, of illegally subletting the loft to "roommates" while living in Los Angeles. Wolf had hired private detectives in New York and Los Angeles and subpoenaed Buchanan's bank records to determine where he was withdrawing money from automatic-teller machines. A judge ruled that Buchanan was using the apartment as "a 'pit stop' motel financed by the roommates who actually lived there," and Wolf was allowed to evict him. "In all, it cost me $100,000 in legal fees and hundreds of hours in court to get back my property," Wolf says. "And during the eight years I was maintaining that apartment, I didn't collect more than $10,000 in rent." Buchanan now lives in Los Angeles, where he has found a two-bedroom unregulated apartment near the beach for $1,000. "It doesn't make my heart sing like Manhattan," he says, "but at least I can afford a place here." He has noticed a difference between the cities: "I don't know anybody here who has a problem with his landlord."
Wolf has finished renovating all the lofts and rented them to tenants not protected by rent regulation, yet somehow everyone is getting along without the aid of lawyers. "It's a great relationship," says Tika Buchanan (no relation to the former tenant), a graphics designer living in one of the lofts. "He basically gives us whatever we want, and he doesn't even charge for extras like the closet he built for us."
Wolf still marvels at the thought of a landlord at peace with tenants. "My tenants have nice lofts, I can pay the bills and we all get along. They walk my dog, I feed their birds. We water each other's plants. It's so wonderful -- all without the intervention of any agency."
 New york's housing policy has evolved in three stages, from capitalism to socialism to insiderism, and you can find examples of each near the southeast corner of Second and B. Mary Spink's building on the corner, erected in 1899, is a remnant of the days when capitalists built for the poor and working classes. The population rose from two million to seven million between 1880 and 1930, but developers more than kept up. Tenements on the Lower East Side emptied as immigrants found new homes. The Irish and Germans moved uptown; Eastern European Jews settled on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx; blacks went to Harlem. An "improvement organization" of white Harlem residents tried to keep out blacks, but the neighborhood's landlords had so many empty apartments that they couldn't refuse anyone.
The socialist era began in 1934 with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who vowed to "take the profit out of the slums." He put the government into the real-estate business with the nation's first public housing project a few blocks from Second and B. Over the next half-century the city, state and Federal governments built or helped finance 500,000 apartments for the poor and middle class, which were never enough to meet the demand. Since politicians couldn't afford to provide cheap housing for everyone, they ordered landlords to pick up some of the tab. In 1947, when the wartime emergency rent controls were extended, officials said that it was just a temporary measure for existing tenants and that it wouldn't apply to new apartments. But they repeatedly extended price controls and included new buildings and new classes of tenants -- a "double-cross strategy," as economists call it, that has discouraged developers from putting up new buildings for fear they'll eventually be placed under rent regulation.
Economists argue passionately about most issues, but not about rent regulation. When the American Economic Association polled its members in 1992 on a variety of topics, the proposition that elicited the greatest consensus -- 93 percent agreement -- was that "a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing." The most quotable summary of the research comes from a Swedish economist, Assar Lindbeck, the former chairman of the Nobel Prize committee for economics: "Next to bombing, rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique so far known for destroying cities, as the housing situation in New York City demonstrates."
A few economists argue that rent regulations are essential in New York because the housing market is so volatile. "Take the case of a taxi driver who moves into a $700 apartment just before a neighborhood gets hot," says Frank Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York, a research and advocacy group. "He settles in, puts his kids in school and then a lot of yuppies are suddenly willing to pay $1,500 a month for that apartment. It's not socially or politically acceptable to just throw out the cabdriver and his family." Braconi advocates a modified system in which an apartment rises to the market price whenever it's vacated, and then the new rent is regulated again for the next tenant.
It's true that rent regulation can help some poor tenants, but it ultimately leaves the poor worse off. "The best way to help the poor is for society as a whole to provide aid directly and insure more housing is built," says Anthony Downs, an economist at the Brookings Institution who has published surveys of rent-regulation research and is a prominent advocate of more low-income housing. "Rent control is basically immoral and unjustified because it imposes a social burden on landlords without providing much help for most of the poor. It provides short-term benefits to the few, many of whom are not poor at all, while creating immense long-term problems." Because they're at the bottom of the housing ladder, the poor suffer the most when rent regulation produces a shortage. Downs notes that after rent regulations ostensibly designed to help the poor were adopted in Cambridge, Mass., and Santa Monica and Berkeley, Calif., the communities were inhabited by more affluent people as rental markets tightened.
As in other cities with stringent rent regulations, the regulated housing stock has deteriorated in New York. Rent regulation wasn't the only reason that tens of thousands of buildings were abandoned in New York during the 1970's -- abandonment also occurred in poor neighborhoods in cities without rent regulation -- but it played a role. On Mary Spink's block more than half the buildings were abandoned or torched during the 1970's and early 1980's.
The building at the corner of Second and B was illegally divided into cubicles for addicts and prostitutes, whose presence drove out many rent-regulated tenants, and then a fire forced everyone to move out. A private developer, the Kestral Company, paid $635,000 for the empty building in 1985. To turn a profit, the developer had to renovate it quickly and inexpensively while making the building attractive enough for tenants paying market rents starting at $1,000. The job was done in less than a year. The apartments were a tough sell at first because of the neighborhood, but with the determined Spink as superintendent the building was eventually filled, and it has been fully occupied for years.
Other buildings on the block fell into the city's hands, with less happy results. When the city becomes a landlord, it excuses itself from paying taxes or sewer and water charges, yet it still loses $200 a month on the average apartment. And it is still a terrible landlord. The only building on Spink's block with a code violation on the front door -- a hole where the window is supposed to be -- is the one operated by the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development. It's a remnant of the socialist era of housing, which waned in the 1980's when city officials realized that they couldn't afford to manage or rebuild the thousands of properties seized from private landlords. But instead of auctioning off its tax-foreclosed properties to private developers, as other cities do, New York offered them to nonprofit groups.
The five buildings next to Spink's corner building were awarded in 1985 to a group of local residents, the Lower East Side Mutual Housing Association. Financed by government grants, the project took seven years and the cost per unit was more than three times what the private developer next door spent.
The tenants for these subsidized units, with rents ranging from $44 to $1,000 a month, were supposed to be chosen impartially from a waiting list of low-income applicants. A quiet scandal ensued after 5 of the 48 apartments were occupied by an association official and his relatives. Eventually the association ran out of money and merged with another local nonprofit group, the People's Mutual Housing Association. It hired Spink, who as director of property management runs the nonprofit buildings the same way she runs the for-profit building next door.
So what did taxpayers get for the millions in grants and tax abatements they have provided to the nonprofit group? Well, the project did provide some subsidized apartments for low-income tenants. But the city could have helped more poor people by giving them the money directly and letting them rent from tax-paying developers, who are generally more efficient landlords than nonprofit groups. During the city's recent $4 billion program to renovate 40,000 housing units, the nonprofit developers spent 50 percent more per unit than the small private builders in the program. Nonprofit groups with motivated volunteers can do a good job providing social services once people are in a building, but they're not the solution to the housing shortage. They're often part of the problem: the transformation of housing from a private enterprise run for profit to a public enterprise run for insiders.
"The typical landlord on the Lower East Side used to be a bottom-rung entrepreneur who used sweat equity to buy the building he lived in," says William Tucker, author of "The Excluded Americans," a history of housing in New York. "Today's system rewards people with political connections and professionals with skills at manipulating regulations. We've transferred property from the working class to the paperworking class."
In theory, it sounds appealing for the public to decide how land is developed and neighborhoods are preserved. In practice, it means that new people don't get homes. The construction project at the northwest corner of Second and B is a rarity today. A building with 66 apartments is going up on the site, formerly an abandoned gas station and supermarket, because of a fortunate combination of circumstances. A relatively large piece of land in private hands was empty in a neighborhood that was becoming fashionable. The developer didn't need to get a zoning variance or bribe any rent-regulated tenants to move. And for some reason nobody tried using New York's zoning and environmental laws to file a lawsuit against the project. Another developer's attempt to build on an empty lot on the Lower East Side was stopped by a successful lawsuit from a community group arguing that the luxury building could potentially "alter the character of the community." In other words, there was a danger that the neighborhood would improve.
Zoning laws keep homes out of the most logical new places for development -- the old industrial areas of the West Side and Brooklyn. The tenure provision of rent-regulation laws has prevented developers from replacing crumbling tenements on a block with one big new building. A single rent-regulated tenant who refuses to move, no matter how much money and how many comparable apartments he's offered elsewhere, can stop the entire project.
"If the city let us, we could build again for the middle class and even the working poor, but every project becomes an expensive ordeal," says Donald Capoccia, who has renovated seven buildings near Second and B over the past decade. Capoccia has been forced to spend most of his time not on building but on working the system: applying for tax abatements and subsidies, negotiating with squatters and tenants, hiring "expediters" to navigate paperwork through the city bureaucracy, forming alliances with nonprofit groups to get hold of city property. One of his city-subsidized projects on Second Street, a partnership with the Kenkeleba House, a group of African-American artists, involved 23 grant proposals over 10 years. At the end of it the nonprofit group had gained a lovely new art gallery at below-market rent and two dozen favored tenants -- they had to prove to the city that they were artists -- had one-bedroom apartments renting for about $600 a month. Because of the bureaucratic delays, Capoccia figures he lost $500,000.
Nevertheless, he thinks that he has gained at least one perverse benefit from the city's housing mess. "If New York simplified its regulations," he says, "I'd have a lot more competition. When developers from out of town see the housing shortage here they want to rush in, but they usually give up after one project. They come in thinking you can just go in and fix up an old building or put up a new one. They think you can make a profit by creating value and making the neighborhood better. That's the reality in other cities. In New York it's mostly a fantasy."
 If june 15 turns out to be a historic occasion, the beginning of the end of rent regulation, a few consequences can be safely predicted. Some landlords will start fixing up their buildings and making repairs they've put off for years. Some developers might reconsider their aversion to building rental housing in New York (although many will remain skeptical). Apartment brokers and Housing Court lawyers will reconsider their long-term career options.
A sudden deregulation of all rent-stabilized apartments, which no one expects, would be a huge disruption for some tenants and lead to an overall increase in the amount that today's rent-stabilized tenants pay in rent. But once once the dust settled, the average increase citywide would be no more than 15 percent, according to separate projections by Pollakowski; Elizabeth Roistacher, the economist at Queens College; and Charles de Seve, president of the American Economics Group, a consulting firm in Washington. (The de Seve study was financed by the landlords' Rent Stabilization Association.) In poorer areas the projected increase would be relatively small -- the median rent for the whole Lower East Side would rise less than 10 percent, possibly not even at all.
The largest increases would be in Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side. For the worst-case scenario, on the Upper West Side, Pollakowski projects that the median increase for rent-stabilized tenants would be 12 percent and that the typical tenant would still be paying less than 21 percent of income for rent. Roistacher and de Seve expect larger increases, in part because they assume that tenants would be willing to pay more for apartments as landlords fixed them up. It's possible, for instance, that the median rent for a one-bedroom on the Upper West Side would initially be $100 more than what rent-stabilized tenants pay today -- as Pollakowski projects -- and then gradually go up another $200 to $300 as landlords renovated apartments. So the Upper West Side would end up with more good apartments, probably at cheaper market prices than today, but some people now in the neighborhood couldn't afford these improvements. Obviously, moving would be a hardship. But de Seve projects that no more than 6 percent of New Yorkers would be forced to move out of their neighborhoods, and at least they would have better options than today elsewhere in the city.
Would Manhattan become less heterogenous? Some parts of it probably would be, although the biggest change might not be in social class -- the rent-stabilized tenants already have income levels fairly similar to their unregulated neighbors -- but in age. Neighborhoods with lots of small rental apartments would presumably be occupied by more young people, as in the rest of America, and older people would be more likely to own bigger apartments and homes because they wouldn't be hanging onto their heirloom leases. Manhattan, contrary to popular fears, would not become an island of the rich. If every person in a household with an income over $100,000 in the greater New York metropolitan area moved into Manhattan, they couldn't fill all the homes on the island.
The best way to maintain the city's diversity would be to build more homes for everyone. Today this sounds quixotic -- getting rid of rent regulation is easy by comparison -- because the impediments to building are so complicated. But if rent regulation is phased out, maybe other changes will take place.
Affluent rentocrats facing the prospect of apartment shopping might think twice about financing the lawsuits of their neighborhood preservation coalitions. Politicians and judges who can no longer arrange insider deals for their children might reconsider the need for the city's morass of regulations. Elected officials might change zoning and building rules to create more affordable homes -- middle-class apartments as well as improved versions of the tenements, boarding houses and single-room-occupancy hotels that once housed the poor. The extra tax revenues from new construction and from deregulated apartments could make hundreds of millions of dollars a year available for direct aid to the poor. As the middle class moved into new homes, there would be more apartments for poorer immigrants to inherit.
Some white-collar immigrants could end up living in modest apartment buildings on the cornfields now around Second and B. In a deregulated city with more new homes, the upper-middle-class professionals now driving up rents in Alphabet City would probably settle in more convenient and upscale neighborhoods, so rents at Second and B might be relatively low for Manhattan. The small apartments would be occupied by middle-class workers and young people, many of whom would stay a couple years and then move on to bigger places. It wouldn't be the kind of static neighborhood with lifetime residents that so many New Yorkers today find appealing.
It would be more like the neighborhood that immigrants used to find when they got off the boat. Each wave of immigrants on the Lower East Side made room for the next because it was still possible to find better homes in better neighborhoods. They came here to escape aristocratic societies where homes and privileges were awarded on a seniority system, and New York surpassed the old capitals of Europe because it welcomed these new people. The fearful rentrocrats now rallying to preserve their homes deserve sympathy, and the most vulnerable of them deserve protection. But as June 15 approaches, it is worth remembering that theirs is not the spirit that built New York.

HEADLINE: Free-Land Lottery Withers on a Prairie in Texas

DATELINE: LEFORS, Tex.

 BODY:
ALL that's missing are the Conestoga wagons, bison herds and sod cabins of homesteading lore.
Marooned on a lumpy prairie where cattle outnumber people and the only shade is under a tumbleweed, this tiny pioneer town is offering a pioneer-style land giveaway in the hope that even a remote and dusty location like the Panhandle will seem an alluring home if the price is free. 
 In November, Lefors (pop. 656) held a lottery of 14 publicly owned plots of land to help attract outsiders and revive the local economy, which has been in a slump since the oil market collapsed in the early 1980's.
Despite the hundreds of mailed entries and the din of telephone calls leading up to the drawing, giving away land in this rustic hamlet, 70 miles east of Amarillo, proved to be more difficult than one might imagine.
But through persistence, officials ultimately enticed enough people to claim a piece of rural Texas that an embarrassing failure was turned into a modest success. These days, residents are cautiously optimistic for the future as they wait for newcomers to arrive down the country highway that meanders across the infinitely flat landscape outside of town.
"There's not going to be a population explosion by any means," said Ben Watson, a City Councilman who helped organize the lottery. "It's going to be slow. But the lottery was a start."
Residents concede that Lefors, named after a local Swiss immigrant rancher of the late 19th century, is not all that attractive. Drive down one of the town's many dirt roads (only two are paved) and you will see boarded-up buildings, weathered clapboard cottages and farm equipment rusting in backyards.
Business is limited to two gas stations, a barber shop, a convenience store, a contractor and a credit union. People rely mainly on cattle ranching for a living. But the number of residents has grown more scarce each year from the peak of nearly 1,000 before the oil bust.
Last summer, Norman Baxter, the local school superintendent, told city leaders of a television report he saw featuring an unremarkable New England town that gave away land to increase its economic vitality. Intrigued, officials here tallied up the city's ample stock of delinquent tax property that was unclaimed at auction, consulted attorneys and devised a short list of lottery rules.
Winners were required to park a house trailer or start building a home on the small, 6,500-square-foot plots that are spread around town within six months of being notified. To gain title to the property -- worth $400 to $1,000, city officials estimate -- they have to stay on the land for five years.
Public and media interest was intense. The city issued a flier to answer the numerous inquires, admitting that "not a whole lot happens here," and describing the employment potential at the prison and chemical plant in Pampa, 12 miles to the northwest.
By the time the deadline arrived in October, 581 people from as far away as Oregon and Maine submitted free entries. In November, the town's secretary drew 28 winners and alternates from a box.
TO be sure, some of those selected were ecstatic. Janice Powell, of Evans, Colo., said her jackpot was an opportunity for her to change scenery and return to her Southern roots.
She and her husband, Brent, a former oil-field "roughneck," plan to open a branch of their carpet business in Amarillo after they pull a trailer home to their sandy, treeless lot within the next few months.
"Lefors is an exciting town," Ms. Powell said. "We're all so suspicious these days. You can't believe it when someone wants to give you something for free."
Then there were the wavering. After visiting the town recently and taking photographs of it to show his fiancee, Chris Crothers, a plumber from Enterprise, Utah, said there was little chance he would relocate, as he put it, to "tornado alley." (Part of the town was wiped out by a tornado in 1975.)
"Lefors is a nice friendly little place and that's about it," said Mr. Crothers, who rents a trailer home and collects disability checks due to a knee injury. "It's a big move and who knows what the resale value would be."
For officials here, the drawing was mostly a letdown. Far from the jubilation most associate with lottery jackpot winners, only four people claimed their land. That number may be optimistic since Mr. Crothers is counted as an imminent arrival.
Winners gave a number of reasons for not coming, with some blaming the monotony of the flat, grassy landscape. Others could not leave their jobs or afford to buy a new home. One woman said her entry was a joke.
With the lottery collapsing, town officials considered alternatives, settling on a first-come, first-served policy that put property owners under no obligation to build on the lots or live there. Anyone willing to pay the modest title transfer fee of $12 could have the land outright and, theoretically, sell it immediately.
While this new policy meant that fewer people would move to town than originally hoped, the City Council considered it better than nothing. The idea was to at least get the land back on the tax rolls. Property taxes for a home assessed at $40,000 on a lot assessed at $1,000 would be $162.60 a year.
The idea worked. Only one of the original 14 lots remains unclaimed today.
Wes Wyatt of Omaha was already looking to move his family near his hometown of Borger, 20 miles northwest of Lefors, when he heard of the land offer. Acting quickly, he claimed a terraced plot for his own, purchased a double-wide house trailer, and plans to relocate his weed control company to Lefors.
Mr. Wyatt estimated that he saved $1,000 by not having to buy the land, and not having to make numerous trips to shop for property. Bemused by his good fortune, he wondered how "Yankees" could not know a good deal when they saw it.
"I don't understand why all those people turned down their land," he said. "I guess they're not used to seeing tumbleweeds."
CHESTER ENGELSTAD, Mayor of Antler, N.D., gives the Lefors repopulation drive a more tepid appraisal. In 1968, a farmer there offered 40 free plots of land to all comers in an effort to keep the local school and churches open. But many of the people who claimed property in Antler built shacks that could not withstand the harsh winter. Even worse, he added, they were lazy.
"The ones that came were the ones that didn't want to work," Mr. Engelstad said. "They tried to come here and get something for nothing and the county had to take care of them."
Virginia Maples, the Lefors municipal secretary, was more optimistic in assessing potential newcomers. After meeting some in person and speaking with others on the phone, she said they seemed genuinely friendly.
For those who missed out on free land, Mr. Watson said Lefors can still be a pleasant place to relocate. During a ride in a pickup truck, he pointed out the abundance of trees in town -- of note because the horizon beyond the city limits is so shadeless -- and spoke of the inexpensive housing market in which a four-bedroom "fixer upper" can be had for less than a car.

HEADLINE: Two Ports, Hundreds of Jobs, Saved in Unusual Pact

 BODY:
THE sun glistened on Long Island Sound one day last fall, as an unlikely group gathered on shore at the former Cilco Terminal on Bridgeport Harbor. Bankers, business people, civic leaders and even a few members of Congress, all in business attire, mingled with longshoremen in jeans and T-shirts. Over a celebratory lunch of hamburgers and sodas, they listened as speakers, one by one, praised an unusual partnership. The longshoremen had bought both the terminal and its New Haven counterpart, in the process rescuing the two ports from bankruptcy, saving hundreds of jobs and sweetening Connecticut's commercial prospects.
Halfway through the speeches, a voice came over the public address system reminding the longshoremen that the lunch hour was over. A Colombian cargo ship full of bananas needed unloading, so off went the new owners, leaving behind their party and distinguished guests. 
 It was a moment that underscored the complexity of the longshoremen's purchase, which its principals have touted as a model of public-private cooperation, as well as the world's first-ever employee acquisition of a port. To make that acquisition, the members of Local 1398 of the International Longshoremen's Association joined with the top managers of New Haven Terminal to form Coastline Terminals Inc. The new company bought the two terminals through an employee stock option plan that was backed by a $10 million loan from People's Bank, a guarantee from the Connecticut Development Authority, and a long-term lease on the two terminals from Logistec Stevedoring of Montreal. The lease was a key to the deal. Coastline lacked sufficient assets to qualify for financing, but People's Bank allowed the fledgling company to put up its lease with Logistec as part of the collateral for its loan. According to the lease's terms, the longshoremen became both landlords and employees of Logistec, which in turn, became both tenant and guarantor for Coastline. Logistec is a publicly traded company with annual sales of $100 million. It runs terminals in eastern Canada and the Great Lakes region, as well as in Philadelphia and Baltimore.
Logistec is also leasing lease the services of its union-member owners, working under a contract that is almost as unusual as the lease that spawned it. The contract rewards the workforce with bonuses for productivity, volume and injury reduction, incentives that are all but unheard of in a tradition-bound industry in which labor-management relations are often strained.
The lease-partnership, with its web of associations, is something of a marvel to all involved. "We're very proud of it," said Martin Tristine, the longtime vice president and chief operating officer of New Haven Terminal who became vice president of Coastline and president of Logistec Connecticut. "We think it might be a model for the industry."
"We're very proud that this went down," agreed Brian Carrafiello, a 25-year veteran of the Bridgeport terminal whose father and uncle also spent their working lives there.
The other key to the deal, say its participants, was the willingness of People's Bank to make an unorthodox loan.
"People's was willing to help when others wanted everything short of our first-born child," said David Shuda, a former longshoreman who has been the local's business manager for 13 years and became president of Coastline Terminals. People's Bank had a stake in the terminals' fate because it had been a creditor of the New Haven Terminal. The bank's officers, however, said they were equally concerned with the effect that the terminals' demise would have had on all the parties involved and on the state's business climate.
"If this had been allowed to go, a lot of people would have been hurt," said Jay M. Forgotson, senior vice president of People's commercial division. "The pension wouldn't have gotten anything, jobs would have been lost, the cities wouldn't have gotten the taxes, unsecured creditors wouldn't have gotten anything."
Besides, said Louis H. Ulizio Jr., executive vice president of the bank, "We are the largest Connecticut-owned bank. Part of our corporate responsibility is to help bring new business to Connecticut. If we don't have ports that they can ship from and we can't show them a viable business climate, people aren't going to come." The bank "stretched as far as we could go to make a good loan," said Mr. Forgotson, but emphatically not an act of charity.
"This was not a gift," said Mr. Forgotson. "It had to make business sense." Logistec's financial strength and state-of-the-art waterfront management skill helped make the deal attractive, he said.
Coastline's entrepreneurial spirit impressed officials of both the bank and Logistec. "Many times," said Mr. Ulizio, "you don't know if you have labor's commitment. We knew we had it here."
"The union did something very innovative," said Madeleine Paquin, president and chief executive officer of the Logistec Corporation, the parent company of Logistec Stevedoring. "They had in their mind that they wanted to be business people. Business people take risks."
Mr. Shuda agreed that in becoming owners, his members had broken with the traditional labor perspective, but he said that the changing marketplace them to do so.
"You have to look down the road," he said. "That's been a good selling point for me because of their age." Although a number have worked as longshoremen for close to 20 years, many of his members started as teen-agers; their average age is 36 and they have many working years ahead of them.
Even before the bankruptcy filing, concern for the future had prompted the local to agree to millions of dollars' worth of contract concessions. The local also undertook a tough-minded review of its health care policies; it runs its own fund to cover vacation time, bereavement days and sick pay, as well as medical insurance. Mr. Shuda recalled that when he took over, the fund was in the red, largely due to a generous drug and alcohol rehabilitation policy. The plan was revised to cover one in-patient rehab per member; if members relapse, they are dismissed. Mr. Shuda said the tough approach has lowered costs considerably.
The longshoremen themselves seem genuinely thrilled.
"This deal was the greatest thing that could happen," said Mr. Carrafiello "For six or seven years we were in limbo, not knowing if we'd ever be on the waterfront again, not knowing if this place was going to close up."
Through bad luck and bad timing, the terminals came perilously close to doing just that. The trouble began in the 1980's, said Mr. Tristine, when the New Haven Terminal purchased the Cilco Terminal in Bridgeport in an attempt to head off its sale to a non-union company whose lower operating costs posed a competitive threat to New Haven. Unfortunately for the newly expanded firm, steel imports began to soften, resulting in a two-thirds drop in the tonnage it handled.
Labor and management banded together for several rounds of belt-tightening that included the union's concessions and downsizing from 400 to about 150 union members. Profits began to creep up, but when Connecticut Bank and Trust, the terminals' primary creditor, failed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation became the primary creditor and forced the company to file for reorganization. It looked like the end.
The idea of longshoremen and management buying the ports themselves "started as a joke," said Mr. Shuda. Two months after the petition for reorganization was filed in Bankruptcy Court, union and management began meeting with prospective investors. Most dismissed the plan in short order.
Logistec entered the equation as a potential buyer of the terminal, a competitor with Coastline. "We first met as opponents," said Serge Dubreuil, president of Logistec Stevedoring. "During negotiations, both sides opened up the door that we should join forces."
It took two years and countless hours of work by teams of lawyers and financial experts, but eventually all the components fell into place, despite efforts by other companies to woo various participants with side deals that would have disrupted the plan.
People's committed the financing, Logistec agreed to the lease arrangement, and the Bankruptcy Court approved the plan. Coastline acquired the entire Cilco property and part of the New Haven property. The New Haven Terminal retained ownership of the rest of the New Haven land and leased its dry cargo business to Coastline. (Part of its liquid cargo operation was leased to another company.)
In the months since the deal was closed, everything has gone according to plan, say the principals.
"It's working very well," said Mr. Tristine, who said the volume of cargo handled at the terminals is about 15 percent over last year. "In any kind of transaction like this, you're going to have things that you didn't anticipate, but the cooperative spirit of the transaction has carried over into reality."
So far, said Mr. Dubreuil, Logistec has issued quarterly productivity bonuses averaging $500 apiece to the longshoremen
"They figure that's fantastic, because they're not doing anything different," said Mr. Shuda.
What the longshoremen say they appreciate as much if not more than the extra cash is the sense that the terminals have entered a new era.
"What we have now that we didn't have before is stability," said Mr. Shuda. "We have the ability to react financially to opportunities that we couldn't before."
He recalled a Chilean shipping line that was shopping for a home a few years ago. To attract the company, New Haven Terminal would have had to build a multimillion-dollar warehouse. While the terminal management went to the state for financing, the Chileans signed a contact with a terminal in Delaware.
"If that happened now, Logistec could finance the improvements," Mr. Shuda said. "They have the financial means to react to that."
The stevedoring firm has spent about $500,000 on a 250,000-ton crane for the New Haven Terminal and plans a $2 million dock repair program in Bridgeport this year. Plans are also under way to update the terminals' forklifts and add a refrigerated warehouse in Bridgeport. "It's like owning your own home instead of renting," said Mr. Carrafiello. "We've got to sell ourselves to the public and show them that it does work."

HEADLINE: Four Companies Get Governor's Citation

 BODY:
IN recognition of their contributions to the county, Gov. George E. Pataki has awarded four Westchester companies his Business Partnership Award.
The Governor, speaking at a lunch last month in Ardsley, also announced that 300 jobs were moving to the 460,000-square-foot Ardsley Park Science and Technology Center, the former United States headquarters of Ciba-Geigy, which relocated to Tarrytown last year and left the site mostly empty. Praising the turnaround in the economy of both the county and the state in the last two years, the Governor cited International Business Machines' decision in 1995 to remain in the county and build a new headquarters in Armonk as the catalyst for change. 
 "The significance of I.B.M.'s vote of confidence in New York cannot be understated," Mr. Pataki said, explaining that the computer giant's decision had prompted other major corporations like Oxford Health Plans, General Electric and Lockheed Martin, for example, to invest in New York.
He also said that the state last year ranked fifth nationally in new and expanded businesses and third for high-technology jobs.
The Governor's award for the largest single investment in the county last year went to the Swiss Re America Corporation, the second largest reinsurance company in the world. The company is building a new North American headquarters in North Castle for 650 current employees and is expected to add 165 new jobs in the next two years. Also, the $100 million project, scheduled for completion in 1999, is providing 500 local construction jobs.
The Nine West Group won the Governor's Business Partnership Award for creating the most jobs last year. The company, which is considered the largest manufacturer of women's shoes in the country, is consolidating its Stamford and Cincinnati operations and is moving its headquarters to White Plains this summer, bringing to the county an estimated 1,250 new jobs. The company was founded at 9 West 57th Street in Manhattan in 1977.
NewRoc Associates won an award for its leadership role in revitalizing downtown New Rochelle. The company plans to begin construction of New Rochelle Center, a 340,000-square-foot regional shopping and entertainment complex, this summer and complete work by 1999. The project will provide up to 700 new construction jobs and 210 full-time and 404 part-time jobs.
NewRoc has already signed as a tenant Stop and Shop Supermarket, which plans to build the largest food store in Westchester. Also, Regal Cinemas is planning a 20-screen theater. And the Ice Center is to build an entertainment and retail complex with two full-size ice rinks.
Robert M. Greene, a co-managing partner for NewRoc, said a demographic study showed that 500,000 people lived within a five-mile radius of the proposed mall in southeastern Westchester and that the nearest concentration of retail stores was along Central Avenue, closer to the center of the county.
"Those two things did it for us," Mr. Greene said, explaining that the city is also rebuilding a municipal garage for the new center.
Projections show that the center will generate up to $122.5 million in sales a year, which would mean nearly $6 million in sales tax revenues statewide and $1.9 million for the city.
The Sraylat Corporation of Mount Vernon won Mr. Pataki's Business Partnership Award as the small business leader last year. Founded in 1936, Spraylat is a third-generation, family-owned paint manufacturer. The company has offices in Illinois, Texas and California and employs more that 300 workers, 80 of them in Mount Vernon. It bought adjacent property in Mount Vernon last year and plans to double the size of its headquarters in a $1.5 million expansion project.
William J. Borner, general counsel for Spraylat and a grandson of the company's founder, Ernest Borner, said last week that the city had offered tax concessions to the company and the county and state had presented other incentive packages, which included, among other things, reductions in utility costs and assistance with job training programs.
The Governor also awarded grants to two high-technology manufacturing firms, Cultor Food Science and Purdue Pharma, which are moving into the former Ciba-Geigy site.
Cultor Food Science, a Finnish food conglomerate, which acquired the Groton-based Food Science Group from Pfizer last year for $350 million, signed a 15-year lease for 100,000 square feet at Ardsley Park and is planning to invest $23 million there. The company is to receive a $350,000 infrastructure grant from the Governor's office.
Purdue Pharma, an over-the-counter pharmaceutical company based in Norwalk, has bought a 105,000-square-foot laboratory building at the park for research and development. It will move 130 jobs to the site and is making $14.7 million in capital improvements. The Governor awarded Purdue Pharma a $200,000 infrastructure grant and a $100,000 skills-training grant from the Empire State Development Corporation.
In turn, the Westchester Partnership for Economic Development, a public-private group, presented Governor Pataki with its "MVP" award for his leadership in attracting and retaining business in the county.

HEADLINE: Revival of the Hudson Remains a Challenge

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
THE Mayor of this village, Dennis P. Flood, always knew it would be a tough sell, but that didn't stop him from dreaming.
While he envisioned a park along the Hudson River, the village yearned for a condominium complex to bolster its tax base. And when the Mayor allowed himself to fantasize about a ball field with lights for night games along the water, common sense intervened and told him it could never happen. 
 But as the Mayor discovered recently, "Sometimes when your back is against a wall, you find a way."
Through a public-private partnership between the village and an environmental group, the former industrial waterfront here will soon be born anew -- not with dense housing developments and yet more industry, as the Mayor had feared, but with a 12-acre park along a rebuilt bulkhead.
Stories with happy resolutions are occurring with increasing frequency along the Hudson River shoreline. And no one can discount the fact that the water itself looks clearer and smells better than it has in decades, causing some advocates to describe it as the environmental comeback story of the century.
But a series of reports from advocacy groups and Federal environmental officials suggests that a long-known pollution problem persisting beneath the great waterway's glistening surface may be more difficult to solve than previously thought.
On the positive side, though, 18 other public spaces like Irvington's have been created along the shoreline on both sides of the river from Albany to Irvington through Scenic Hudson, a Poughkeepsie-based environmental group. As the organization's executive director, Klara B. Sauer, said last week, "Many good things are happening quietly, piece by piece."
In addition, Gov. George E. Pataki -- who grew up along the river -- has deemed the Hudson's health the linchpin of his environmental agenda. And last year he unveiled his Estuary Management Action Plan along with $31 million in financing, to begin the remediation process. The Governor's $1.75 billion Clean Air/Clean Water Bond Act will also cover some Hudson River projects.
On a national level, the 104th United States Congress designated the Hudson Valley a National Heritage Area, making it eligible for Federal funds from the National Parks Service. The Hudson River Valley Greenway initiative, an intercounty effort to link 150 miles of parks, museum sites and recreational areas along the shoreline, continues to gather steam.
And in Westchester, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke called last week for a coordinated effort by the county's Hudson River communities to develop a tourism and economic development plan.
"For the first time," Mr. O'Rourke said, "the municipalities along the Hudson are being considered as a unified planning region."
Worrisome news, on the other hand, has included the announcement on April 16 by American Rivers designating the Hudson as the second most endangered river in the United States because of extensive PCB contamination in its upper reaches.
According to the report by American Rivers, the Washington-based environmental organization, the Hudson "remains arguably the largest PCB contamination site" in the country." The Missouri River was listed as most endangered because the Army Corps of Engineers "dramatically altered" its course, the group said.
An estimated 500,000 to 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls were discharged into the Hudson River by General Electric Company for three decades until the late 1970's. Before their use was ruled illegal, the chemicals were used as insulation in electrical devices. PCB's are known to be carcinogens, and recent studies suggest they may also cause diminished intelligence in the fetuses of mothers who eat contaminated fish.
After complying with Federal orders to stop using PCB's, General Electric also agreed to contain seepage of the contaminants, concentrated at its plant in Hudson Falls, north of Albany.
It was long thought that the best remediation involved containing the PCB's and leaving them to degrade naturally. But in February, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency reported after 15 years of study that the chemicals do not break down and lose their toxicity at a rate sufficient to enable the river to heal itself naturally. And even when efforts are made to contain the chemicals, as General Electric is doing, floods and other river actions cause them to be re-suspended and transported downstream.
The environmental agency will issue its official recommendations in December 1998.
In a separate study, the State University School of Public Health in Albany found that when Hudson River mud is exposed to the air, as in times of low river flow, up to 4 percent of the mud's PCB content evaporates in a day. What is more, airborne PCB molecules have the same toxic makeup as PCB's at the bottom of the river, although their potency in human tissues is still under study.
A third study conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reported that levels of PCB's in tree swallows along the river have been found to be higher than levels measured in other birds. The river's tree swallows are also showing signs of reproductive problems, a side effect of the chemicals documented in laboratory animals.
The latest advisory from the State Department of Health this spring on chemicals in sport fish and game showed similar concerns. Its health advice for infants, children younger than 15 and women of childbearing age is to not eat any fish from the Hudson River. For others, the advisory suggests no more than one meal a month of fish. But the department recommends eating no fish caught between Hudson Falls and Troy Dam. Adding to the growing resolve among environmentalists and government leaders that the only way to cure the river may be to remove the PCB's, Scenic Hudson issued a report on April 24 recommending that dredging be employed despite short-term setbacks.
"With at least a pound of PCB's seeping from the sediment hot spots each day, dredging has less impact than a few months of doing nothing," the report said. General Electric, however, said that the Federal Government's report is preliminary and that a decision on how to deal with the problem would not be made until late 1998.
A General Electric spokesman, David C. Warshaw, said that the company was continuing to seal off the Hudson Falls PCB site and so far had spent $130 million toward that end. He also said that General Electric, "like everyone else, is committed to getting the river back to the condition it once was in."
Mr. Warshaw further observed that when General Electric discharged PCB's into the river it did so under a Federal permit and when it was ordered to stop discharging the pollutant, the company complied.
The company is opposed to dredging, the spokesman said, explaining that it would "be very disruptive to tourism and recreation on the river and create a landfill problem," among other things.
That nevertheless may be the way to go. John Mylod, one of the few remaining commercial fishermen along the river, said that dredging, despite its drawbacks, "holds out the only hope that in 10 to 15 years, we'll be able to fish the waters again without fear." Others are angry that General Electric has not been required to do more. At the New York Public Interest Group in Albany, Judith A. Enck, a senior environmental associate, called it "one of the great political tragedies in New York State's history that it doesn't seem to matter who the Governor is, they all seem unwilling to stand up to G.E." Ms. Enck has been an environmental advocate since Gov. Hugh L. Carey was in office in the late 1970's.
A spokesman for Governor Pataki, Gary F. Sheffer, denied that the Administration was unwilling to go to the mat with General Electric over the PCB issue.
Others were worried that the recent reports would overshadow the good that has been accomplished along the river.
"Let's keep this in perspective," said Ms. Sauer of Scenic Hudson. "Let it not tarnish all our other efforts."

Events Along the Hudson
HERE is a sampling of events taking place along the Hudson River this month:
Friday: The County Planning Department and the Historic River Towns of Westchester will hold a public planning conference to discuss the future of the shoreline region from Peekskill to Yonkers from 3 to 6 P.M. at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. The public is invited to attend, and copies of a draft framework for the tourism and economic development plan are now available at local libraries, municipal offices, the Planning Department and on the Web at www.co.westchester.ny.us.
Friday: Lincoln Diamant, author of "Chaining the Hudson," will talk about his, which focuses on the Revolutionary War in the Hudson River Valley. The talk will begin at 7:30 P.M., at the Beczak Environmental Education Center, at 21 Alexander Street in Yonkers. For more information, call 376-0859.
May 18: The Riverlovers Seventh Annual Shadfest will be held at Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., rain or shine. There will be music, food, environmental exhibits, American Indian crafts and children's events. Christopher Letts, a Hudson River educator, called the event the "mother of all shad bakes." Henry Gourdine, 94, considered the dean of the river's commercial fishermen, will be honored at that time. For information, call 271-3554.
May 23: Joseph Squillante, founder of the Hudson River School of Photography, will speak of his love affair with the river at the Beczak Environmental Education Center at 7:30 P.M. Mr. Squillante has traveled the Hudson from its source at Lake Tear of the Clouds to the Battery in Manhattan and has exhibited widely. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Downtown;
Oversupply of Office Space Is Starting to Dwindle

 BODY:
THE recently announced decisions by the Standard & Poors Corporation and the Chubb Insurance Company to commit to long-term leases totaling almost 1.1 million square feet of space in an underutilized building at 55 Water Street in lower Manhattan are drawing more attention to what has been happening downtown in the last few years.
Through a combination of an improvement in business at the financial companies that have long been the economic engine of the area, an emphasis on emerging technology companies and the ongoing conversion of some obsolete office buildings to residences, the huge oversupply of office space that was the result of the slump of the early 1990's is beginning to dwindle. 
 The vacancy rate for office space downtown in all categories has declined to 17.1 percent as of the end of March, compared to a high of 20.5 percent in 1992, according to statistics compiled by Cushman & Wakefield..
To be sure, Standard & Poors decided to move to the location only after a long flirtation with New Jersey and a tax and energy incentive package worth $23.7 million, but the fact that it chose to consolidate at that location is an indication of how the market has changed, industry executives say. S&P took 937,000 square feet, while Chubb signed up for 150,000.
"It's a vastly different world today than it was a few years ago," said Howard S. Grufferman, a senior managing director at Julien J. Studley, which specializes in representing tenants. "The vacancy rate in Class A is under 10 percent, and the landlords are starting to get more aggressive. We advise tenants to move quickly to get their deals done."
Others acknowledge that an improvement is under way but say its impact is uneven. "The pickup is isolated to the 15 best buildings," said James S. Meiskin, president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage company. "Rents are up and concessions are down in Class A, but it is not happening in Class B and C buildings. There is an over 30 percent vacancy rate in Class C."
Nevertheless, the growth in the number of jobs in the financial sector will force companies to seek space to house the additional workers, said John M. Cefaly, an executive director in the downtown office of Cushman & Wakefield. "The private sector is expanding for the first time in a long time," he said. He said the city's plan to offer tax abatements and other incentives for development in the area was beginning to show effects.
Nevertheless, in a mixed market, it helps to have a distinguishing characteristic that makes one property stand out from the crowd. Among the approaches being undertaken are an emphasis on communications technology and aggressive updating of aging buildings in good locations.
The triangular building at the intersection of Wall, Beaver and Pearl Streets was the first investment in America by a German mutual fund, usually known by its initials, DEGI. The fund paid $16.8 million for the 75-year-old building in 1980 and put $20 million more into it over the last five years in a refurbishing that includes repairs to the roof and facade, increasing the size of the lobby from one to two stories, updated mechanical systems and new elevator cabs.
Klaus Hohmann, the chief executive of DEGI, said that buying a building with the address 67 Wall Street was a reasonable first investment for a European company. "Downtown New York and especially Wall Street is symbolic of a capitalist type of economy," he said. "I did not have to explain this address to anybody."
He said the fund decided to invest in the property during a real estate recession to gain a competitive edge over other older buildings in the vicinity and because of a long-term approach toward property ownership. "In Germany, real property is considered an asset class of its own," he said, "but in the United States it is a commodity."
The investment seems to be paying off. Despite its age, the building is 94 percent occupied and never had a serious occupancy problem even during the recession, said its property manager, David Schlang, who has been associated with it as a manager and sometime owner since 1957.
"Older buildings that have been kept up in this area do well," said Richard M. Feldman of Williamson, Picket and Gross, marketing consultant to 67 Wall. "The older ones that have not been kept up do not."
ANOTHER approach has been to emphasize advanced communications capabilities and other technical features to attract computer-intensive companies such as Internet service providers, web-site designers and other companies generally grouped under the rubric "new media." The pioneer in this regard was the Rudin family, which took a building that had stood empty for five years, and was not particularly attractive because of its low ceiling heights and small floors, and converted it into the New York Information Technology Center.
"We are basically done here," said William C. Rudin, the general partner in the renovation project at 55 Broad Street. "Within 60 days we will be finished with leasing." He said that about one-third of the companies leasing space at 55 Broad had never before had a presence in New York but wanted to be near other fledgling companies developing related technologies.
He said the company was looking for another property for a similar conversion. "We are going to have a technology district here," he said. "The city has a diamond district and a fashion district, why not a technology district?"
Mr. Rudin admits that because of the heavy investment in technology and the relatively low annual rents (an average of $17.29 a square foot, according to brokers) it will be a long time before the building produces a financial return. But by transforming 55 Broad from a building that had once been occupied by Drexel Burnham Lambert into the hub of high tech in the area, it enhances the prospects for other family holdings in the area, he said.
Certainly, the success of the project has encouraged would-be emulators. With $200,000 in marketing assistance from the city and a similar amount from the Alliance for Downtown New York, six buildings in the area are participating in a program designed to attract new small businesses that want to cut the cost of access to the Internet. Each owner is contributing $10,000 to the effort.
Called the Plug 'n' Go program, it involves pre-built, pre-wired office spaces that are leased for short terms at annual rents of $15 a square foot, a discount in a market where rents are now in the high teens to low 20's. "The concept is to fill a niche by developing a Levittown for cyberspace," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance. "These are starter homes for young companies."
Mr. Weisbrod acknowledged the program's debt to the Rudins' initiative. "There was a lot of path-setting at 55 Broad," he said. "This program would not have been possible without that success."
The reason for the short leases is that these new companies do not know if they will grow, fail or end up being absorbed by another company, said Sharon Greenberger, who manages the program for the Alliance. A typical lease, she said, is for two years and 1,500 square feet.
She said that since the program was announced in February, 20 leases, accounting for 35,000 of the 120,000 square feet involved, have been signed. The buildings are at 11 Broadway, 32 Broadway, 55 John Street, 90 John Street, 111 John Street and 90 William Street.
Having space already prepared with high capacity communications lines, such as the T-1 line, and Internet service providers cuts communications costs, said Jonathan Rudes, who helps manage 90 John Street and 90 William Street for Newmark & Company Real Estate. "It can cost about $1,000 a month for a T-1 line and $500 to $700 a month for local charges," Mr. Rudes said. "That adds up to $1,700 a month, which can be steep for a small company." In a wired building with an Internet service provider managing access to the high capacity line, the local charges are eliminated, cutting the monthly cost about in half, he said.
Mr. Weisbrod, who noted that the buildings involved in the Plug 'n' Go program were generally considered Class B, said this kind of specialized marketing and conversion of old office buildings to residences would continue to whittle away at the downtown vacancy problem. "We are ahead of where we thought we would be two years ago," he said. "The downtown area is undergoing an extraordinary transformation.

Architects Find Right Rx For Former Medical Lab

 BODY:
THE refrigerator had a big red sticker that shouted "Caution -- Bio Hazards." There was another notice that informed anyone looking at the abandoned medical laboratory building that the lab had been licensed by the city to work with viruses and microorganisms.
"I was pregnant at the time," recalled Michele Kolb, an architect, "and -- I admit it -- I did start to worry." 
 "Our first call was to some doctor friends," added Eric Rosenberg, her husband, also an architect.
"I was getting prepared to be told that when I opened one of the cabinets I'd released some rare strain of microbe on New York City," Ms. Kolb recalled with a shudder.
When looking for a town-house bargain, many people are willing to put up with anything -- almost anything -- to get a deal. And when the couple found out that the toxic materials had been removed and their worries about deadly contamination were groundless, they did, in fact, get a deal. They paid $395,000 for the four-story, four-bedroom town house at 164 East 91st Street, between Lexington and Third Avenue.
The couple, who had been living in a one-bedroom apartment at 83d Street and Third Avenue, clearly needed to expand. Ideally, they were after a town house, so they could install their joint architectural practice downstairs and make their parenting duties more convenient. (At the time, their practice was on 26th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.)
"We wanted to eliminate the commute so Michele could care for the children and still remain active," Mr. Rosenberg said (they now have two children, Owen, 3, and Kyle, almost 1). "We had been looking for years, and somewhere along the line, we'd kind of stopped. We bought some land in Stone Ridge, N.Y.," -- in upstate Ulster County -- "and, in 1991, we built a new house." The design was a collaboration, he said, like all their work.
But one day in 1993, Ms. Kolb was thumbing through the classified advertisements and spotted a house marked "Commercial" in the Houses for Sale category.
"What caught our eye was the price: $600,000," she said. Even though the real estate market was not as heated as it is now, she said, the price still looked low: houses in that neighborhood were then priced between $1 million and $2 million. They quickly saw why the price was so low -- only they didn't think it was low anymore.
"It was a complete wreck," said Mr. Rosenberg. The place had been rented by a medical laboratory for 40 years, he found out. At one time, all the floors had been used by the lab; by the time the couple saw it, only the parlor floor was being used. On the top floor, the couple saw water leaks and water damage; they saw broken windows and the pigeons that had flown in -- "not all of them alive," Mr. Rosenberg said.
"In other words, it was the type of place that would scare most people away," he said.
But underneath the water damage and the filth was a sound building. "It didn't have sagging floors," he said.
"We learned it was built in the late 19th century," she said. "It was originally a town house with a stoop. The facade had been very ornate, with an elaborate cornice and trim; it looked exquisite on the drawings."
In 1912, the original detailed facade had been stripped away, and the house had been extended to the front property line. At some point, a so-called picture window was stoppered into what had been the parlor floor -- and the entire facade was coated in stucco. In 1955, the building had been renovated to create the laboratory.
"They had stripped it, and done a very bad Bauhaus interpretation," Mr. Rosenberg said.
After surprisingly little negotiation, the couple said, the owners accepted $395,000, but troubles soon followed -- including a lawsuit between the seller and the laboratory that delayed the sale.
The settlement took two years, during which the couple became the butt of office jokes. "It was a joke with our colleagues and friends," Ms. Kolb said. "We had done the drawings; we'd been there 100 times. It got so bad we couldn't even mention it to them. They'd roll their eyes and say, 'Sure.' "
They proved their friends wrong. They did indeed buy the property -- in March 1995. But the tenant was still there.
"They'd lost their legal standing," said Mr. Rosenberg, "and they went within a month or two without too much kicking and screaming."
During the extensive renovation -- the couple's ninth as architects -- Ms. Kolb stayed at the site, acting as their general contractor, running the job and hiring the subcontractors. Because they found skilled craftsmen and worked with them on site, the owners said they were able to do things they wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise, things such as herringbone brick-lined fireplaces.
They had to work fast, because they had to pay additional interest for their construction loan. Because of the condition of the building, no bank would give them a regular mortgage, which costs less per month. When they were finished, they were able to turn the construction loan into a residential mortgage -- and their interest went down two percentage points.
AT that point, they were also able to go to the city's Finance Department and change their tax designation, from commercial to residential -- and cut their tax bill by three-quarters. (They declined to give their tax figures.)
The couple also had to file for an amended Certificate of Occupancy, as well as a special reconsideration of the city building code to allow them to reconfigure their staircase.
In the end, the total gut renovation -- which included permission from the Department of Transportation to build a privacy fence four feet out on the sidewalk -- took five months. It included not only a new interior but changes to about one-third of the facade, chipping away masonry to make new and bigger window openings and adding steel. They shored up the building so they can add, if they wish, five more feet in the rear.
They had a strict budget -- $350,000 -- so they had to make more than a few compromises, such as the veneered, prefinished cherry floors (versus thick, solid cherry) they found at an auction for $1.25 a foot. They also found sales on bulk materials and contract overages. "If somebody ended up with 60,000 square feet of limestone, you can buy some or all of it," Mr. Rosenberg explained. They took rocks from their excavation of the ground floor and created a backyard patio.
For the six bathrooms, they used decorating tricks: They bought cheap (they prefer the word "economical") ceramic tile, but then bordered it with more expensive tumbled marble, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces.
Although they kept the interiors streamlined -- partly because of budget, partly because of their taste -- they designed the renovation so that future owners can transform the interiors into a more elaborate prewar place. Their planning included placing the ceiling heating registers four inches from the wall to allow for the addition of crown molding. In the end, they believe they turned what had been a graffiti-covered eyesore into a sophisticated place to live and work.
"Town houses are selling in this neighborhood for $400 a square foot," Ms. Kolb said. "Ours came in closer to $200."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Huge 16-Year Smithville Project Under Way Again

 BODY:
FOR the last 16 years, construction has been on-again, off-again at the huge mixed-use project in the Towne of Historic Smithville, a rural enclave in Galloway Township in Atlantic County 11 miles northwest of Atlantic City.
Construction delays were first caused by a dispute with environmentalists concerning the 2,200-acre site, which borders a national wildlife refuge and contains streams and wetlands. A lawsuit resulting in compromise in 1986 with a new ownership resolved this matter. In 1991, the recession stalled construction, pushing the owner into default and three years later lenders holding portions of a $25 million mortgage took the unfinished project in lieu of foreclosure. 
 Now the development's residential component -- once planned for 6,800 units then whittled down to 4,000, of which fewer than 1,600 were built or started -- is moving forward. But it will have a different mix, including housing for active adults, fewer units and a new owner -- K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, the state's largest builder. The project's revival is the result of three years of discussions on how to proceed with development of the site. The negotiations involved Hovnanian, the lenders, local, state and county officials, a coalition of state and national environmentalists, and resident homeowners.
Agreements have been reached, or are being completed, to meet the concerns of each group. All say they are hopeful the project will be completed and they will get what they were promised. The site surrounds the town center, a collection of 18th-century buildings refashioned into speciality shops and restaurants. Hovnanian will buy the land in sections from Galloway Holding Company, the entity created by the lenders to sell the site. They include Core State, NatWest and First Union.
"Combining our interests was the best way to recoup as much of the face value of the mortgage" as possible, said Carl Goldberg, partner of Starbare Associates, an affiliate of Roseland Property Company, a Roseland developer. Starbare took over part of the Smithville site when it bought a pool of distressed properties from NatWest in 1993. Neither side would disclose the sales price. But industry professionals put it at about $10 million.
Under a township approved development plan Hovnanian will build 2,000 residences instead of the remaining 2,500 units that could have been built by the previous developer, a subsidiary of the Patt Organization of Hollidaysburg, Pa. At least 30 percent of the units will be part of a community that offers people 55 and over in their retirement or preretirement years recreation, socializing and someone else to do the outside maintenance. The rest of the residential component will have no age restrictions.
Ara Hovnanian, president of Hovnanian Enterprises, said his company had purchased the property because of its "appealing price" and location, near Atlantic City and the shore. With Atlantic City "seeing renewed interest, the timing was also good," he said. He was referring to the $7 billion in public and private investment planned or under way there, including the tripling of casino hotel rooms to 27,000.
Mr. Hovnanian said that having the flexibility to do both age-restricted and other housing would support so large a project, now called K. Hovnanian's Four Seasons at Historic Smithville.
The project will be the fifth active-adult community in the state for Hovnanian, and others are planned. Some 417 age-restricted units, including both detached and town houses, are expected to be completed through 1998. The estimated value of the entire project, which will be built over the next 10 years, is $300 million, said Robert H. Karen, president of the shore area region for Hovnanian.
The development is helped by signs that the market for active-adult housing in the state is strong. Among the reasons are an aging population and a healthy resale market, which enables buyers over 55 to sell their existing homes, industry analysts said.
There is also the continuing trend nationally for people to retire close to their family and friends. And William E. Becker, a Teaneck-based consultant specializing in housing for the elderly, noted a recent trend within New Jersey to build active-adult communities outside of their traditional sites, such as Ocean County, long a magnet for such housing. He said eight projects were being planned throughout the state that could produce 6,000 units over the next two years.
GETTING the Smithville project to this point was not easy since the number of groups and issues involved complicated negotiations over its future. "It was like nailing Jello to a wall," said Lewis S. Kurland, Hovnanian's attorney.
Under the agreement being worked out with homeowners the company will build the promised, but never delivered, recreational amenities and road improvements, make repairs to existing structures and tear down the 60 incomplete units that have been hurt by time and neglect. And it, along with the banks, will turn over control of the housing management to resident homeowners sooner than required.
"It is understandable that some homeowners are still upset and skeptical based on the history of the project," said Thomas D. Giachetti. He is a partner with the law firm of Stark & Stark, which is representing the Smithville Homeowners Association, as well as two individual condominium associations. "This is not a perfect solution and all the work is not done yet."
But, he added, there "is renewed hope about project's future" and that residents will see a return on their investment.
Hovnanian will also fulfill, with modifications, the 1986 agreement the environmental coalition, including the American Littoral Society in Sandy Hook and the National Audubon Society, worked out with Patt, the previous developer.
The compromise was reached after the coalition sued the state for improperly granting permits in 1981 to the original developer, Cadillac Fairview of Toronto, to build 6,800 residences, 800,000 square feet of commerical space and a golf course. The plaintiff successfully argued that the project would endanger the area's water supply and wildlife and that the runoff would harm the oyster beds in the Mullica River and the clams in the Great Bay.
Under that agreement 4,000 homes, 300,000 feet of commercial space, but not a golf course, could rise on part of the site while 1,000 acres would be left permanently open and transferred to a nonprofit entity. Patt also was to contribute $200 from the sale of each unit to pay for, among other things, the maintenance of the open space.
Though Patt built or started some 700 units, which were added to the 857 homes Cadillac had built, the environmentally sensitive acres were never transferred and the $200-per-sale contribution was never made. Hovnanian will transfer that protected land -- now a habitat for a bald eagle, an endangered species -- to an as yet-undetermined group as it develops the rest of the site and will make a similar contribution for its upkeep. The boundaries of the land still must be determined.
"Hopefully this is the final chapter," said D.W. Bennett, executive director of the American Littoral Society. Added Walter Pomeroy, mid-Atlantic regional vice president of the National Audubon Society: "It will bring closure to a battle we won 10 years ago and give us our land." And, he said, the project will be half its original size.
For Galloway Township the revamped project brings a number of positives. It puts a derailed project back on track at a lower density and with adult housing, which will not burden local schools, said Andrew S. Katz, the township manager.
Mr. Karen of Hovnanian said work had begun on the first 82 age-restricted detached homes, ranging in size from 1,200 to 1,860 square feet and in price from the low $100,000 to $160,000 range. Sales are to start at the end of May. Within a month the company expects to offer town houses with 1,100 to 1,400 square feet and priced from about $90,000 to $110,000. Plans are also moving forward on an additional 275 detached homes.

HEADLINE: An Effect, Not a Cause

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "No Need to Raise Rates Again," (Viewpoint, March 30), the economist Edward Yardeni asserted that the Federal Reserve was wrong to combat inflation at this time and that he did not support further tightening of interest rates by the Fed in May. 
 Mr. Yardeni also says that the United States economy has been prospering without an increase in inflation, because of the advances in labor productivity and other cost-cutting technologies. This is clearly possible. But the argument closes with this remark: "Our prosperity is a result of disinflation!"
Disinflation, however, is a fall in the inflation rate; hence, it describes a situation in which prices are rising more slowly over time. Moreover, in a competitive market, the behavior of prices is determined by the interaction of demand and supply.
The advances in labor productivity are examples of positive supply shocks that cause disinflation and prosperity. Disinflation, then, is the effect, not the cause, of a more productive labor force.
I would say instead that "our disinflation and prosperity are the result of advances in labor productivity." The distinction needs to be made, or else one might draw the wrong conclusion -- that the Fed should follow a policy of disinflation.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
A Machine to Call Your Own

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
YOU may be miffed about paying surcharges for using automated teller machines. But be careful if think you see a way to cash in on the trend.
As A.T.M. fees have risen, so has the number of promoters peddling the machines to individual entrepreneurs as the route to a quick fortune. Few of these deals, however, work out as promised, according to consumer advocates. 
 It makes little sense for most individuals to own A.T.M.'s because of the enormous price per machine, usually $35,000 and up, and the continuing expenses that can put an additional $35,000 a year on the tab.
"When you look at who actually buys A.T.M.'s, it's usually businesses that install them on site," said George L. Albright, president of Speer & Associates, an Atlanta consulting firm to the banking industry. "Aside from the expense, an individual owner may have a difficult time getting sponsored by a bank to get into the A.T.M. network. Without that, none of the customers could use the machine."
Such hurdles, however, have not thwarted the pitches. Advertisements inviting readers to own their own A.T.M.'s -- and promoting guaranteed returns of 40 percent or more -- have run regularly in several national newspapers.
One of these deal makers is American Business Concepts, a company based in Glendale, Calif., that says it formed in November just to take advantage of the rise in A.T.M. surcharges -- part of which go to the A.T.M. owner and part to the supplier. In a classified ad in USA Today in March, the company said anyone with $10,000 could buy a machine and "make money every time someone uses your A.T.M."
Trouble is, by the time one reporter, anyway, called American Business Concepts, the price for the machine was quoted as $15,000.. And Len Kalish, a pleasant salesman for the company, wants to make sure up front that you have the cash before continuing his pitch.
Satisfied when you say you can get the money, he goes on briefly about his daughter who is completing her doctoral work at the University of California at Los Angeles, joking that intelligence is obviously not hereditary. After chuckling to himself, he quickly outlines the economics of owning an A.T.M.
Unfortunately, virtually everything he says is wrong.
For example. you're lucky, he says, to be interested in an A.T.M. today. People couldn't own A.T.M.'s until April 1996, when Congress passed a law deregulating the industry, he says.
According to Mr. Albright, however, individuals have always been able to buy A.T.M.'s. What changed last April was that Cirrus and Plus -- the country's two largest A.T.M. networks, owned by Mastercard and Visa, respectively -- allowed their members to levy surcharges. That, of course, had nothing to do with Congress.
Next, Mr. Kalish says, if you sign up, American Business Concepts will assign you a location visited monthly by 25,000 to 50,000 passers-by. Assuming that 2.5 percent to 5 percent of them stop to use the machine, he says, that's great play for a full-service machine that costs only $15,000.
If your machine were part of a large cost-sharing network, as most large banks' are, you could break even with the 625 minimum monthly visits that Mr. Kalish has implied.
But as the owner of a lone machine you will need far more activity. How much more? Try 3,000 transactions a month, according to some consultants. And an A.T.M. priced at $15,000 may sound like a good deal. Large banks that buy in bulk seldom pay less than $35,000 apiece, with some models running as high as $110,000, although consultants say cheap knock-offs can be found for as little as $7,000.
After explaining to you how the A.T.M. business works, Mr. Kalish is ready to divulge exactly how you're going to get rich: through surcharges. These machines levy a $2 surcharge on every transaction, on which you'll clear $1.20.
That's because there are, of course, some expenses. American Business Concepts will take a 10 percent cut off the top on every transaction. The armored car service that delivers the money for use in the A.T.M. will take 5 percent. Insurance -- you need at least $2 million to cover theft and liability, Mr. Kalish advises -- should cost 2.5 percent, and the lease, well, maybe the landlord will also want another 2.5 percent off the top. But hey, it's a turnkey deal. Now, asks my salesman, when do you think you can come up with the $15,000?
You mumble politely that you can't figure out what happened to the part of the $2 surcharge that is still unaccounted for: about 40 cents. Well, he can't either.
(Repeated calls to the company for official comment on their sales information were not returned.) Mr. Kalish knows only that this is a good business and a great opportunity. He's got your address and is sending the packet by overnight mail.
One more thing, he says. You'll send the money as soon as you get this package?
You'll do that, won't you?

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROAD CHANNEL;
Ferry to Be Free, but Queens-to-Queens Bridge Is Still $1.75

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF

 BODY:
For years, residents of this small island community situated in the middle of Jamaica Bay have protested the toll they pay to travel the half-mile-long Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge to the Rockaway Peninsula, a neighborhood with which they share a ZIP code and a high school. Many Broad Channel people work on the peninsula.
Last week, as Mayor Giuliani toured Queens pledging to eliminate the 50-cent fare on the Staten Island Ferry and anticipating the end of the two-fare zone, people in Broad Channel wondered what happened to the promise the Mayor made to them during his last campaign. 
 They said that while seeking their support, Mr. Giuliani promised that if elected he would consider repealing the $1.50 bridge toll. The heavily Democratic community voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Giuliani. Since the election, the bridge toll has risen to $1.75.
"That toll is 100 percent unjust," said Dan Tubridy, 48, a resident of Broad Channel who owns the Pier 92 restaurant on the Rockaway Beach side of the bridge. Mr. Tubridy said the toll cost him and other local residents about $1,500 a year, a large sum for people living in some of the most economically depressed neighborhoods in Queens. "It's the only interborough bridge in the city," Mr. Turbidy said. "You have to pay to go from Queens to Queens."
"Mayor Giuliani never made a commitment concerning the Cross Bay Bridge," said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor. She added that with the introduction last year of the E-Z Pass, the windshield sticker that collects tolls electronically, the cost of the crossing dropped to 67 cents for pass-holders.
Audrey I. Pheffer, the Democratic Assemblywoman who represents the 23d District, remembers things differently. "That's a joke," Ms. Pheffer said in response to Ms. Roche's statement. "When Mr. Giuliani came to the community asking to be Mayor Giuliani, he promised to get rid of the toll. Between him and the Governor with their appointees to the M.T.A. board, it should have been gone long ago."
Once a drawbridge, the Cross Bay Bridge was completed in May 1970. When the bridge opened, the fare was 10 cents. Since then, residents have seen the tolls soar. Some increases have prompted violent protests and boycotts during which some participants were arrested.
The bridge is maintained by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, a branch of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The income from tolls collected on all city bridges and tunnels is pooled to support new transportation projects, maintenance and to pay off outstanding bonds. Almost $6.5 million was collected on the bridge last year.
"We have been sensitive to the issue, but the bond contracts require us to charge tolls on all New York City bridges and tunnels," said Frank Pascual, a spokesman for the transportation agency. CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Giving Savings Bonds a Shot in the Arm

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FACED with dwindling sales, the Treasury moved suddenly last week to rejuvenate its savings bonds, still the world's most widely held security.
As of May 1, rates are higher, interest accrues faster, the risk of a big penalty is reduced and, believe it or not, the Government has even made things simpler. 
 "This is very positive," said Daniel J. Pederson, a private specialist who attributed much of the recent sales decline to the allure of stock funds. "Immediately, people who buy bonds will be getting an extra one to one and a half points" return.
So a $10,000 investment in savings bonds that previously would generate perhaps $450 a year will now provide $550 to $600, no small improvement for this most conservative security. Federal taxes are still deferred, of course, and like other Federal securities, savings bonds are free of state and local tax.
The terms on savings bonds bought before May 1 are unaffected by the latest changes. The interest rate on those is 85 percent of a combination of a short-term Treasury rate and a long-term rate.
Here is the new deal: The interest rate is 90 percent of the average yield for five-year Treasury securities over the preceding six months. These rates will be announced on May 1 and on Nov. 1 and will apply for the following six months. Savings bonds bought this month carry an initial interest rate of 5.68 percent.
Two years ago, the Treasury took away the guaranteed minimum return on savings bonds. Until May 1995, investors could rest assured that they would get at least 4 percent a year. Before 1986, the minimum rate was 7.5 percent. Since the variable-rate program began, sales have tumbled, probably for several reasons, including the lack of a floor, the overall decline in interest rates and the soaring returns available from competing investments like stocks and stock mutual funds.
Sales of savings bonds, which come in denominations from $50 to $10,000, fell from $17.5 billion in 1993 to $7.2 billion in 1995 and $6 billion last year. Still, ownership by 55 million Americans makes savings bonds the most widely held security.
Interest on new Series EE savings bonds, which are really zero-coupon securities because the return comes entirely from an increase in their stated value, will accrue monthly instead of only twice a year, and the interest will be compounded twice a year. This change eliminates the risk of an investor losing as much as five months' interest by redeeming a bond a bit too early, as was possible under the old system.
On the other hand, there is now a three-month interest penalty for redeeming bonds within five years, part of the Government's effort to raise the nation's woefully low savings pace, 4.2 percent of national output, less than that of many developing countries. Under the old rules, a buyer needed to hold bonds only six months to avoid an early-redemption penalty.
But the previous system had two tiers. Anyone who held bonds for less than five years received 85 percent of the average rate on six-month Treasury bills. Anyone who held bonds for longer received 85 percent of the rate on five-year Treasury notes.
With this in mind, Mr. Pederson, author of "U.S. Savings Bonds: A Comprehensive Guide for Bond Owners and Financial Professionals," suggested that people at least consider selling old bonds and reinvesting in the new, more attractive ones that will also earn interest for up to 30 years. One drawback to such a plan is that investors will have to report the interest earned so far and pay tax on it.
People who bought bonds many years ago should also dig those up. Holding bonds past their maturity date is a no-win proposition. Interest stops accruing, and an estimated $4 billion in savings bonds have stopped earning anything for their owners.
IN any event, since all savings bond returns are tied to the first business day of the month, it is almost always a good idea to buy as late in the month as possible and to redeem as soon as the proper month arrives. With careful planning, said Peter Hollenbach, a Treasury official, "you're getting about 59 days' " more interest than someone who times poorly.
In addition to tax deferral and exemption from state and local levies, the not-so-humble savings bond still allows proceeds to be applied tax free to college tuition, provided that household income is not too high in the year the bonds are redeemed. The tax break starts phasing out this year at $76,250 for a joint income tax return.
Because all Series EE bonds are marketed at half their face value and interest is pegged to market rates that change every six months, the time when they will reach full face value cannot be predicted. To provide some certainty for buyers of newly issued bonds, the Treasury said it would make a one-time upward adjustment to achieve the face value of any bond 17 years old that low rates had prevented from getting there on its own.
And the Treasury, which already has set up a home page for savings bonds on the World Wide Web (www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/ sav.htm), has further marketing efforts on the way. Later this year, it will introduce on-line buying with credit cards. Early in 1998, it will offer the first inflation-proof savings bonds, whose returns will be indexed to consumer prices.

The Stronger Dollar Chases Fewer Bargains Abroad

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
IF Americans picked their foreign destinations by the breaks they get when the dollar strengthens, there would be a flood of tourists to Turkey, Ecuador, Hungary and Japan this summer.
The dollar now buys nearly 80 percent more Turkish lira, making it easier to come home with a carpet; 25 percent more sucre for Panama hats in Quito; 20 percent more forints for Herend china in Budapest, and 20 percent more yen for a kimono in Kyoto. 
 During the last year, the dollar has risen sharply against most of the world's major currencies, a move spurred by the pace of United States economic growth, the continuing good performance of the stock market and the rise in American interest rates.
In reality, the jump in the value of the dollar does not translate into the same amount of savings for Americans abroad, as hotels and restaurants raise their prices and street vendors bargain harder. Inflation in some countries can also erase the benefits of a strong dollar.
"We haven't seen a terrible increase because of the stronger dollar," said Aylin Spears, a partner in Blue Voyage, Turkish Tours and Travel in San Francisco. Many hotels are setting their prices in dollars, she said, and inflation is rising quickly enough to erode the dollar's gains.
Even so, the big move of the dollar in the last year is still cutting prices overseas. Not that falling prices make much difference to American tourists. According to travel analysts, Americans do not seem to be swayed by such currency swings in the short run.
"We don't see these types of changes being significant in a span of 12 or 18 months," said James V. Cammisa Jr., a travel industry analyst in Miami.
So, if you are traveling to the 10 favorite foreign destinations for Americans, what's in store?
Among those top 10, only Japan is also among the 10 countries against which the dollar had its best rally over the last year.
Switzerland and Spain ranked high among favorite destinations (12th and 13th, respectively, in 1995, the latest data available) as well as among places where the dollar performed the best (gaining 17.55 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, in the 12 months through May 1.).
The dollar has appreciated in value -- but not as much -- against the currencies of France, Germany and Italy, which ranked fourth, fifth and sixth on the top 10 destinations list.
Britain, the third-most-popular destination, may be especially enticing, for those interested in seeing London with its first Prime Minister from the Labor Party since 1979. But tourists are unlikely to come for the bargains. Britain's economy has been rebounding -- a fact that did not help the Conservatives -- and so has the British pound.
In the last year the value of the dollar against the pound has shrunk 7.5 percent, lifting the price of Saville Row suits and tea and scones alike.
While rejoicing at the better values in Russia, Pakistan, South Korea and Sweden, as well as in Continental Europe, American travelers should not get too giddy. The deals are better now, but they are nowhere near what they were a decade ago.
In the early 1980's, the dollar was rushing toward record highs against the Japanese yen and the currencies of Europe. So while the 5.82 francs, 1.72 marks and the 126 yen to the dollar today look far better than the 5.18 francs, 1.53 marks and 105 yen of a year ago, think what you could have bought when the dollar equaled 10 francs, 3.45 marks and 262 yen in 1985.
This great downswing in the value of the dollar since the mid-1980's seems to have had more impact on visitors to the United States than on Americans tourists abroad. It was the sharp fall in the dollar that lead to a surge of travel to the United States at the end of the 1980's. And those foreign tourists were spending more here than Americans were spending abroad.
With that decline in the dollar, Canadian tourism to the United States shot up, rising 13.5 percent in 1987 and 77 percent from 1986 through 1991. But as the American dollar has rebounded against the Canadian dollar, the pace of Canadian tourism has fallen off. The annual number of visitors is down 21 percent since 1991, according to the Commerce Department's preliminary estimates for 1997.
Over time, however, a stronger dollar does seem to affect the choices of where some Americans go, especially if the country is already a favorite destination. Mr. Cammisa said the dollar's 60 percent rise against the Italian lira since September 1992 had clearly stimulated travel there. Commerce Department data show that in 1995, the number of Americans going to Italy jumped 12 percent.

Is Your A.T.M. Ripping You Off?

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
ASK Pat Bond about his visit to an automated teller machine near his home several weeks ago, and he will tell you how he was almost robbed -- not by a mugger, but by the A.T.M.
When Mr. Bond, a computer consultant in Bethesda, Md., who usually banks at a credit union in Virginia, punched in the amount of his withdrawal, the A.T.M. flashed a warning that it was about to deduct $3 more, the fee for using that machine. Riled, Mr. Bond hit the cancel button and walked away. 
 "The banks believe we have no choice but to pay these fees," Mr. Bond said. "Well, there is. I can still walk with my feet to a bank that doesn't charge fees."
Well, he can try.
On that day, to save the $3, Mr. Bond got into his car and drove 25 miles to his credit union. Since then, he has sometimes used his debit card at the checkout counter of the supermarket to get cash or driven to a local Citibank branch, which does not levy surcharges.
Such maneuvers are becoming increasingly common as more and more people are hit with sticker shock at the nation's cash machines, owned by banks and other companies, prompting countless on-the-spot decisions about just how much they are willing to pay for one of modern life's most cherished conveniences. To some degree, the future shape of the banking industry depends on how many people vote with their feet, and in which direction they head.
"Banks have discovered a new way to make money they didn't have before," said George L. Albright, president of Speer & Associates, a retail banking consulting firm in Atlanta. "In the past, no matter how high the fees on A.T.M.'s have been, most consumers went right on paying. We're heading toward a day when that won't be true anymore."
 For 25 years, the industry has trumpeted cash machines as street-corner liberators, freeing banks of a big chunk of their payroll costs and freeing consumers from the need to stand in line for a teller and the worry that they will be caught short of cash.
Americans have become hooked on the convenience. Last year, medium use meant 72 visits to the machines, according to Payment Systems Inc., a Tampa, Fla., consulting firm to the banking industry. Heavy users, who account for one-sixth of all A.T.M. card holders, averaged 156 visits to machines last year.
In the beginning there was no charge to use the machines, and even now it is the rare bank that imposes a fee on its customers for access to its own A.T.M.'s. But over the years almost all banks slapped on a $1 charge, known as a foreign-use fee, for going to another bank's machines. Now the levies are often $2, and climbing. One of those dollars still pays the foreign-use fee, which is split among the customer's home bank, the A.T.M.'s bank and the A.T.M. network -- Plus or Cirrus, for example. But the other money usually goes entirely to the bank whose machine was used. An exception is when an A.T.M. is placed inside a store, and the merchant may take 30 cents of the extra dollar.
That second or even third dollar, known as a surcharge, has not only riled Mr. Bond and plenty of other A.T.M. users; it has also caught the attention of Federal and state legislators, who are introducing bills to ban its imposition.
With the surcharges, A.T.M.'s have become so expensive to use that consumers can often get money cheaper from last-resort venues like check-cashing companies, places once frequented mostly by the financially unstable. No more. A New Yorker who makes a $100 withdrawal from an A.T.M. that levies surcharges typically pays some $2.50 in fees, including the foreign-use charge. That same person could use a check-cashing service and lose only 1.1 percent, or $1.10.
In fact, in this instance, A.T.M. users would even come out better by buying brand-name traveler's checks, which cost only 1 percent of the total, or $1.
The banks defend the surcharge on several grounds. They say they need it to cover the expense of installing and servicing A.T.M.'s in new "off-site" locations like shopping malls, theaters and department stores. They also say they need it to curb a good thing that has started to spin out of control: too many customers are using the machines too often to make tiny withdrawals, tying up the cash networks and adding to administrative and other costs.
But critics contend that the banks simply can not resist an easy chance to charge more money, particularly because most if not all of the surcharge, they say, falls directly to the bottom line.
"What this comes down to is people paying a double charge to use an A.T.M. and then not getting any extra benefit back," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, who heads the Senate Banking Committee and says he will soon reintroduce Federal legislation that would ban surcharges. "That's just not right." His first bill to ban surcharges failed to get out of committee in May 1996.
In any event, the extra charge of a dollar or two is turning into big bucks for the banks. Over the next 12 months, banks could ring up as much as $1.9 billion in revenues from the surcharges, according to the United States Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization in Washington. That is more than the 1996 sales of the Adolph Coors Company.
So much easy money is flowing in that A.T.M.'s may even become grist for pyramid schemes. Hundreds of investors nationwide have snapped up shares in the machines only to discover months later that they have been defrauded, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Last October, at the request of the S.E.C., a Federal judge placed the Western Executive Group and Cash Systems U.S.A. Inc., both of Gilbert, Ariz., into receivership after the two companies were accused by the S.E.C. of bilking more than 100 investors out of $4.5 million.
Western Executive was said by the S.E.C. to have offered investors full ownership of off-site A.T.M.'s at prices of up to $24,000 each, with promises of 17 percent to 20 percent annual returns over five years. But the money did not come from A.T.M. profits; it came from new investors, the S.E.C. said. Western Executive bought 119 A.T.M.'s and set up 41 of them, but only a handful were profitable, the S.E.C. said.
Charles R. Rietz, the former president of Western Executive, which also controlled Cash Systems, said the companies did nothing wrong. According to Mr. Rietz, Western Executive sold 203 A.T.M.'s at $23,000 each. And he contended that the companies "had some internal business problems which could have been handled on an internal basis, but the S.E.C. chose to see sinister things in our business situation."
A civil trial is expected early next year.
"The fact that you can get A.T.M. surcharges creates an opportunity for income," said David Bassham, a lawyer in the S.E.C.'s Los Angeles office. "A.T.M. schemes are a new type of fraud for us."
LEGISLATORS and consumer watchdog groups are worried about the impact of the new fees on the nation's 11,867 credit unions. Since many credit unions have only one cash machine, more of their customers are likely to visit other banks' A.T.M.'s. The groups fear that large numbers of credit union members will switch their accounts to banks or savings institutions that have extensive A.T.M. networks. That could cripple some already weak credit unions while giving virtual monopolies to large banks in certain markets.
"One thing that won't be good for consumers is for the big banks to get bigger and the small ones to get smaller," said Gail K. Hillebrand, a lawyer in San Francisco for Consumers Union, the Washington-based consumer advocacy group. "Fewer players in the market will leave consumers at the mercy of these bigger players."
That will give them the power, she said, to charge ever-higher fees and to possibly unleash new ones.
"And then there will be no place to run," she added.
Banks are already becoming more creative when it comes to levying fees. Two years ago, First Union, a banking company based in Charlotte, N.C., started charging some customers for putting money in the bank. Customers in North Carolina (and now in Virginia) pay 50 cents to use a counter deposit slip -- the kind found inside the bank and used there only for teller transactions. First Union says the charge is justified: customers who use counter slips tend to stall the teller lines and cause encoding errors, problems that would not occur if they used an A.T.M. instead.
But as controversial as A.T.M. surcharges are, they are not going to disappear any time soon. Even Senator D'Amato acknowledges that his bill to ban them is likely to go nowhere.
For one thing, notwithstanding the many Pat Bonds of the world, millions of other consumers don't notice, or don't care, when they are assessed extra fees. And some legislators say they will refuse to limit the amount of money banks make. Many of them say the consumer should pay for A.T.M. convenience; to avoid the fees, they say, A.T.M. users can seek out machines that don't charge them.
Even though foreign-use fees are almost universal, it is true that surcharges are not yet levied on A.T.M. users in every state. The surcharges are most prevalent in California, Florida and Georgia, where most banks levy them, and they are widespread in New Jersey. But Connecticut and Iowa have banned the fees on A.T.M.'s in their states, although banks based there can still impose surcharges on machines in other places. And in New York, only eight banks impose the fees. Two of the largest -- Fleet Bank and First Union -- are dwarfs compared with Chase Manhattan and Citibank, no-surcharge banks with A.T.M.'s on virtually every Manhattan corner. Both, however, charge foreign-use fees.
"Right now, it's true that New York has a lot of banks that do not charge surcharges," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who has a bill pending in the House that would require disclosure of any surcharges on every machine. "But that may not always be the case. What's important here is that most consumers don't know when they're being charged a hefty fee for using an A.T.M. that's not owned by their bank. I'm pushing for more disclosure."
THOSE hefty fees are likely only to increase. Consider these numbers: Some 45 percent of A.T.M.'s now levy surcharges, compared with just 23 percent eight months ago, according to the United States Public Interest Research Group. And the average surcharge nationwide was $1.15 in March, up from 97 cents last September.
Three states -- Arkansas, Mississippi and Wyoming -- have capped the amount that can be charged, although in Mississippi, the cap is scant comfort to consumer advocates. Banks there can pocket a surcharge of $2, or 4 percent of the withdrawal, whichever is greater. That means that for every $100 withdrawal, A.T.M. users can pay up to $5, including the $1 foreign-use fee. A.T.M. users in Wyoming can pay a maximum of $1 and in Arkansas, $2.
Although 93 percent of all banks and savings institutions charge foreign-use fees, according to Speer & Associates, and though, according to bank consultants, the average A.T.M. user shells out $72 a year in these fees, legislators have largely left those charges alone. That is because banks have argued convincingly that these fees are meant to cover the system's expenses. For each $1 fee, the bank that owns the cash machine usually gets 65 cents, while 10 cents goes to the A.T.M. network -- like Mac, Plus or Cirrus -- to which the machine is connected, according to banking consultants. That leaves 25 cents for the consumer's bank.
Seeing the margins on the foreign-use fees as too slim, several Texas banks in 1986 became the first to impose a 25-cent surcharge on transactions at their new A.T.M.'s at shopping malls, theaters and department stores. Not only did the surcharge quickly double to 50 cents; it also spread to A.T.M.'s at the Texas banks' headquarters and branches. Then other banks started imposing them.
The surcharges were primarily confined to the Sun Belt until last April, when Plus and Cirrus -- the nation's largest A.T.M. networks -- agreed to allow their banks to levy the extra fees in most places nationwide.
This year, the average A.T.M. user is expected to pay $155 in combined fees, according to industry consultants. The fees amount to a charge of around 2.5 percent on the average withdrawal of $87 from a Plus A.T.M., according to Bank Network News, a Chicago newsletter. That is more than twice the 1.1 percent charged by New York check-cashing outlets or by American Express for its traveler's checks.
The fees add up quickly, especially for A.T.M. users in areas with a limited number of banks. But even large cities can prove troublesome. Just try to escape a surcharge in California if you do not have an account at Wells Fargo or Bank of America, but you use their A.T.M.'s. Those two banks alone levy fees on 46 percent of the state's bank machines.
Ronald Bennett, a computer salesman in Reading, Pa., started cashing checks at the supermarket with his debit card as often as possible last year in order to avoid A.T.M. surcharges, but he still wound up using some A.T.M.'s and paying $120 in fees.
"You can't always make it to one of your bank's A.T.M.'s," he said. "The banks get money from the customers because we're an easy target. But when you're talking about $120 just to get my money from the bank, that's a lot. I could have paid my Internet bill for a year with that, not to mention several months of my phone or cable bills."
A.T.M. owners often levy heftier surcharges at machines in supermarkets, hotels or theaters, betting that many consumers will pay the fees instead of leaving their groceries at the checkout counter or missing the movie in order to drive to their banks.
Surcharges are highest in places where the consumer is almost sure to stay put. In an Atlantic City's casino, an A.T.M. transaction usually costs $4.
But not every machine in a prime location carries a surcharge. For example, some 500 of the 698 A.T.M.'s in New York owned by the EDS Corporation -- the country's second-largest A.T.M. owner after the Bank of America -- do not impose one, even though the machines are at Food Emporium and Pathmark supermarkets. Surcharges at the other EDS machines are 50 or 75 cents.
Telling the expensive machines from the free ones is often tricky. The New York Public Interest Research Group found in a survey in April that several bank machines did not disclose the surcharge until after the consumer had entered the amount of the withdrawal, forcing a quick decision about completing the transaction.
Others don't tell until the transaction is over, said Representative Schumer, who added that he became so concerned about disclosure that he made it the prime focus of the A.T.M. bill he sponsored in the House eight months ago. The bill is still in committee.
"The amount of the surcharge should be disclosed before you make the transaction, not on the statement afterward," Mr. Schumer said. "It should be on the screen or in a place where the consumer can clearly see it."
In criticizing A.T.M. fees, consumer advocates are particularly angry that customers are paying for a service that is saving the banks money. A teller transaction typically costs a large bank $1.07, compared with just 27 cents for the use of an A.T.M., according to Gemini Consulting, a management consulting firm in Morristown, N.J.
"From a conceptual point of view, it makes more sense to put the surcharge on teller service," said William Gregor, a Gemini senior vice president in Cambridge, Mass. "A few years ago, First Chicago and Citibank tried it, and they received a very negative response from the public. It's not something they're willing to try again."
Only a few banks are offering no-fee A.T.M. service as a way to attract depositors. But even then, strings are usually attached.
The Bank of New York, for example, requires A.T.M. users to keep at least $3,000 on deposit to escape foreign-use fees, which it then either waives or pays on behalf of the customer.
The hidden cost to the customer, though, is the lost opportunity to earn more interest on the $3,000 somewhere else. A savings account at the Bank of New York earns only 3.9 percent interest, or $119 a year.. A customer might be better off investing in a mutual fund and paying the fees. If the fund garnered only a 10 percent annual return, or $300, the investor would still come out $109 ahead, assuming the $72 paid in average foreign-use fees each year.
It is precisely that flow into high-yielding mutual funds that makes fees necessary, the banks say. With billions of dollars moving out of low-interest saving accounts into Wall Street's money market funds, banks say they can no longer afford to give anything away. On top of that, 50 percent of all households with checking or savings accounts are money-losers for banks, according to the First Manhattan Consulting Group, a New York firm.
"Plenty of people with accounts won't have a credit card or a car loan at the bank and yet they will come in and ask the teller to check their account balance for them," Mr. Gregor said. "The banks use A.T.M. fees to make up for these money-losing accounts. And there are plenty of them."
Unprofitable accounts aside, bank executives argue that A.T.M. fees are justified. The charges, they say, keep A.T.M. users from making numerous withdrawals, a habit that costs the banks 25 cents to 45 cents a transaction depending on the volume, according to Speer & Associates.
THE economics are relatively simple. Off-site A.T.M. machines are expensive to buy and install, easily running $110,000 for a machine that is heavily armored, not counting upkeep.
To break even without surcharges, an off-premises A.T.M. needs to make 3,000 transactions a month, according to Bank Network News. If surcharges are imposed, that same A.T.M. can break even after 500 transactions.
"We call the surcharge a non-customer-use fee," said Paul J. Levine, a spokesman for First Union, which has 64 A.T.M.'s in Westchester and Rockland Counties in New York. All levy $1.50 surcharges.
"We charge the fee because it wouldn't be fair for someone to use our network and not bear part of the cost of the system," Mr. Levine said. "We've had only a very slight decline in volume when we initiated the fee, much less than what we expected."
But some consumers, like Mr. Bond, are indeed voting with their feet, as inconvenient as that may be. They are using their own banks' A.T.M.'s and tellers and moving their accounts to banks with larger A.T.M. networks.
Others are still paying the fees but are increasing the amounts of each withdrawal, thus cutting down on the number of transactions.
Carrying huge wads of cash or planning a day around getting money are understandable responses, but they defeat the whole point of putting so much metal at consumers' fingertips. When the machines first opened for business, banks expected to benefit each time a machine displaced a human teller. But consumers were also supposed to be well served.
"The way A.T.M.s are set up now, consumers still have a choice," Mr. Gregor, of Gemini Consulting, said. "If Citibank decides to charge a $10 surcharge, you can always move to Chase. What you don't want to happen is for every bank in town to charge surcharges. Then it will be like living in the Sands casino. There's one game in town. And you're losing it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Where the Street Meets the Strip

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
ALL I needed to hear was that investment guru Howard J. Ruff was going to be at "The Money Show" this past week here, the gambling mecca of the Western world. I didn't care that I would be lunching with the legendary Louis Rukeyser. I was blase about partaking in seminars where I could quiz famous forecasters like Elaine Garzarelli.
I didn't even care that there would be tons of free advice on the next hot stocks, the inside scoop on interest rates, sample newsletters and lots of useless promotional knickknacks. 
 No. I just wanted Howard.
You see, Howard Ruff and I have had a thing since I was 13 -- only Howard doesn't know it. Howard, who writes the Ruff Times newsletter, is the reason I became a trader and spent six long years on the floor of the American Stock Exchange shouting my lungs out. His 1979 chef-d'oeuvre, "How To Prosper During the Coming Bad Years," so affected me that after only three chapters I was buying canned food and stockpiling it in the basement. The bad times never came but a particularly vicious Buffalo blizzard did, during which I was able to sell the entire hoard to my parents at inflationary prices.
He's still a Gloomy Gus. Addressing the extravaganza here as one of the keynote speakers, he argued that today's stock market is "thoroughly picked over." The only stocks he endorses are overlooked small-capitalization issues, like Brighton Technologies, a marketer of computers in China, and Red Oak Hereford Farms, a meat processor in Red Oak, Iowa.
For the three days of the meeting, a period when the Dow reassured investors by soaring nearly 3 percent, I was part of the trek of the faithful. Starting on Tuesday, about 9,000 investors from 50 states swarmed into Bally's Las Vegas, rubbing elbows with their favorite prognosticators, scouting for advice and comparing the track records of their gurus against competitors.
The impresarios of "The Money Show," Charles and Kim Githler, a husband-and-wife team out of Sarasota, Fla., have been producing investment seminars since 1981, but this is the Big One, bearing out that dictum from Kevin Costner in "Field of Dreams": "If you build it, they will come."
And have they ever. What Renaissance weekends are to East Coast intellectuals, this event is to small investors. The gatherings began modestly enough as run-of-the-mill conventions in San Francisco and Orlando, Fla., but they took a new turn when Las Vegas was added to the schedule, along with the occasional expert-packed cruise to the Baltics. This year, the promoters are expecting to accommodate a total of 45,000 by adding shows in Chicago and Seattle.
What accounts for this irrational exuberance? It can't be Bally's food (at $2 a banana, no one was buying), or the fact that attendance costs next to nothing. (Actually, you have to subscribe to one of 5 financial newsletters at $49 to $235 a year to get in. Air fare and accommodations are extra.)
For the real answer, look no further than the shelves of the nearest bookstore, groaning under the weight of financial self-help books.
"Of all the big financial shows, this one's the best," said Neil J. George Jr. chief economist for the St. Louis-based Mark Twain Bank, which just merged with the Mercantile Bank. "In three days, we can interact with 5,000 to 7,000 present and potential customers in our target market -- perhaps even teach them all about trading foreign currency, a main service of ours."
Certainly there's no letup in the lava-like flow of stock market information inundating America's investing public. As the Dow marches higher, turning gutsy investors into millionaires, individuals are managing more of their own retirement money. Women are no exception. Last year 1,950 advice-hungry women made the pilgrimage to Las Vegas, up 11 percent from 1995. And 1,542 attended the 1996 show in San Francisco, up almost 30 percent from the year before.
Most of the crowd is between 55 and 65, but regardless of age, there seem to be three types of attendees, according to veteran Money Show-goer Timothy Walker of Grosse Ile, Mich.: "Those who have a lot of money, those who think they have a lot of money and those who want a lot of money." His wife, Katherine, fitting right in with her Mickey Mouse T-shirt and sequined cap, adds, "And you can't tell who's who by the way they're dressed."
One common denominator is a penchant for research -- their own. Judging from a survey of the participants that was conducted before the event, you'll never see these people giving a blank check to their local brokers, or opening discretionary accounts. In fact, they remind me of the typical Home Depot shoppers -- the weekend do-it-yourselfers. They ask a lot of questions and virtually all subscribe to one or more newsletters. Seventy-five percent use discount brokers and many belong to investment clubs. The majority say they have dabbled in option, commodity, and currency trading.
And by now, many of them have learned one of the most appealing attractions of "The oney Show:" if you go to all the seminars and panel discussions, you're bound to find support for your point of view -- whether you are a bull, bear or fence-sitter.
Here's what the bulls were saying:
Frank Holmes, chairman and CEO of U.S. Global Investors, warned, "If you're not long, then you're going to be wrong." He's investing in Russia and in technology stocks.
Elaine Garzarelli, editor of The Garzarelli Outlook, sees the Dow hitting 7,600 this year. She likes consumer services, nondurables, technology, banking and insurance and she advises steering clear of iron, steel, aluminum, and housing stocks.
And Al Frank, editor of The Prudent Speculator, a newsletter, whose model portfolio has been ranked No. 1 one over the last 15 years with a 21 percent compounded annual return, expects a summer rally. He is partial to beaten-down technology stocks and bank stocks and thinks a small interest rate cut could nudge the Dow to 8,000 by year-end.
AND what of the bears?
Geraldine Weiss, publisher of nvestment Quality Trends, another newsletter, advises putting 30 percent of your money into undervalued stocks; the rest in Treasuries and certificates of deposit.
Stan Weinstein, editor of The Professional Tape Reader, mistrusts the technology sector, would avoid aerospace plays like Boeing, and sees the Dow tumbling to 6,200 by year-end. "Only 30 percent of the stock charts are technically healthy right now compared to 70 percent last year at this time," he said.
Sitting squarely on the fence was Bert Dohmen, editor of "Bert Dohmen's Wellington Letter." In his view, "the bear market has already started for many stocks," noting that 77 percent of Nasdaq stocks were 20 percent off recent highs. Still, he's bullish on real estate investment trusts, banks and European stock markets like those of Germany, France and England.
Got all that? Who could? Fortunately, for the financially challenged, there were less weighty distractions.
Take the Nasdaq booth, where a fantastic new Web site was being demonstrated by a representative wearing funky magenta-colored glasses festooned with verdant palm trees.
Then there was Jay Baker, a buttoned-down managing director of the American Stock Exchange, patiently explaining the workings of SPDR's, an index fund that mirrors the Standard & Poor's 500, pronounced "spiders," while next door the Princeton Research Group was promoting franchises of Hubbs Pubs, a restaurant chain featuring 99 beers from around the world.
In yet another booth, conservatively dressed representatives of Lucent Technologies, the equipment company that was spun off from AT&T last year in the largest initial public stock offering ever, kept trying to hand out copies of its annual report. Attendees, however, were far more interested in World Wide Web Casinos, a stock offering of an Antigua-based outfit enabling individuals to enter a virtual casino and gamble over the Internet.
And it wouldn't be Las Vegas without scantily-dressed show girls, in this case operating overhead projectors and otherwise doing their thing for the future of capitalism. James Dines, editor of an eponymous newsletter and a noted gold bug, is convinced that the presence of show girls raises the net asset value of anything he does. But even "The Money Show" has its limits. At last year's San Francisco show, he was instructed by management to send his models home in order to "go long" additional clothing in order to "cover their short positions."
The talk of this year's show was the stunning Catherine Curran, a 6-foot-1, 18-year-old Las Vegas native, who was earning tuition money for Dartmouth College, where she starts in the fall, by handing out information for the Ultimate Cigar Company, a purveyor of cigars that went public not long ago. It needs her help badly. The stock, which trades over-the-counter almost by appointment, ended the week at $1.50, or 50 cents lower than where it started the week and a far cry from the $9.75 it was fetching in December. Maybe it was just as well that there was no easy way to punch up stock quotes in the entire hotel.
So, in the final analysis, do attendees get anything out of this?
After 200 talks, panel discussions and exhibits, this former Wall Street professional was totally overwhelmed, so I imagined that most others walked away confused, too. But that was not the case. Despite the information overload, most attendees didn't seem to have any trouble filtering out the hype and the irrelevant. David Houck of Minneapolis, a retired controller for Archer Daniels Midland, has attended the show for eight years. He comes for the stock tips. Over the years he's used information from the shows to get into Merck at $29 (now $90.875), Honeywell at $29 (now $70) and John Deere at $40 (now $46.50).
Robert Arena, a mining equipment salesman, came from Price, Utah, to learn more about options trading. Last year he was inspired by the wisdom of Bernard G. Shaeffer and subscribed to Shaeffer's Option Advisor newsletter, but has since decided to look elsewhere.This year Mr. Arena listened intently to a presentation by Kenneth R. Trester, an options expert, and if he decides he likes what he heard, he'll subscribe to Mr. Trester's Complete Option Report.
Henry and Marge Hazenberg, from Kennewick, Wash., attended their third "Money Show" in order to check out the latest investment gadgetry. Last year they subscribed to a computerized, market-timing service called Vectorvest Prographics, a computerized charting software program that analyzes and ranks more than 5,500 stocks. The couple saw the program at the show and said it "helped them to make a lot of money."
On the other hand, Tom Krenick of Henderson, W.Va., is just happy to pick up free samples of all the different newsletters.
Some find money. Others find love.
The Githlers estimate that 40 percent of attendees are single. The couple know of 12 matches made through the events. Two part-time New Yorkers, Charles and Elizabeth Holmann. met at the San Francisco show three years ago and announced a merger a few years later. Mr. Githler explains it this way: for a relationship to work, people have to be compatible on every level -- and sometimes that includes being able to sit through hourlong economic seminars.

HEADLINE: Pariahs of the City: 24 Hours in a Cab

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
AT 4:11 A.M., Tasneem Khan carefully spread a green prayer rug across the linoleum floor in his apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. Dressed in jeans, a navy blue golf shirt and a white Muslim prayer cap, he was a study in contrasts. Softly murmuring prayers in Arabic, he turned his stocky frame toward Mecca. Slowly rocking back and forth, Mr. Khan, a 35-year-old Pakistani immigrant, readied himself for a grueling 12-hour-shift as New York's work horse, pariah and ambassador to the world.
Mr. Khan, his partner Sajid, and about 20,000 other Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi immigrants are the new face of New York City's $1 billion-a-year yellow cab industry. Jumping from only 7 percent of the city's 41,000 licensed taxi drivers in 1984 to more than 50 percent today, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the typical New York City cab driver is now more likely to be from the Punjab than from Long Island City. 
 But some New Yorkers aren't celebrating. As is common in the ritual of immigration in America, the newcomers are greeted with hostility. Fairly or unfairly, South Asian cab drivers are stereotyped by some customers as rude and unable to speak English, disparaged by fellow drivers as vicious competitors who cause accidents, and blamed for what some drivers say is a steady decline in wages and respect in what was once one of New York's prized working-class professions.
"They're part of making it worse," said Johnny Northern, who's been driving a cab since 1972. "Customers tell me they have a terrible attitude."
But 24 hours in the life of Mr. Khan and his partner, and interviews with dozens of South Asian cab drivers, reveal a group of immigrants hoping to follow the well-carved path of Russian Jews, Haitians and others who have driven cabs to gain an economic foothold in the United States. But the South Asian hacks face a new, unexpected obstacle in their scramble toward the middle class: strict new immigration rules.
On Urdu-filled CB radio channels and in Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants and garages, the talk is of deportation and confusion. How the law enacted last September and tougher political asylum regulations enacted in January 1995 will affect New York's South Asian community and the taxi industry as a whole remains unclear.
Mr. Khan, who took advantage of a 1986 amnesty law to get American citizenship, is one of the lucky ones. His 28-year-old partner, Sajid, who entered the United States illegally and spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his first name, faces possible deportation.
"Last month, everyone said the deportations would start on March 31, but nothing happened," said Sajid, whose family paid a trafficker $10,000 to smuggle him into the United States. "Everyone is afraid. I'm afraid too."
On Thursday, April 24, Tasneem Khan started off late. He had visited the family of his ill father-in-law the previous night, and awakened at 3:30 A.M., a half hour later than usual. A devout Muslim, he decided to catch the 4:41 A.M. bus instead of his usual 4:21 bus so he wouldn't have to rush or skip prayers.
He shares an immaculate one-bedroom apartment with his 27-year-old brother, Nadeem, who works in a newsstand in the World Trade Center. Their six sisters and parents are still in Lahore, Pakistan. The two brothers see each other for only a few minutes each day because of their conflicting schedules. Waiting in darkness and rain on the deserted corner of Madison Street and Cypress Avenue in Ridgewood, Mr. Khan boarded the Q58 bus for the 20-minute ride to his yellow chariot.
In an increasingly common practice, Mr. Khan and Sajid lease their cab for a week at a time. To get the most from their lease, the cab operates nearly 24 hours a day, seven days a week. While one man sleeps, the other drives.
At 5:05, Mr. Khan finds the cab parked on the corner where Sajid leaves it each night. He starts an engine that has been idle for no more than two hours. At 5:10, he is cruising west down the Queens Boulevard service lane, hunting for his first fare of the day.
Mr. Khan grew up in the city of Lahore in Pakistan. As a cricket player and athlete, he was depressed by the weight he put on when he first started driving a cab. Daily workouts after his 12-hour shift now keep him thin. After graduating from Punjab University in 1980 with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in business, he entered the United States in 1981 on a student visa.
He took a few courses but quickly ran out of money. After working in newsstands in Manhattan for five years, he met a Pakistani-American woman through a relative and married her in 1990. In 1989, he started driving a cab. He used his savings from driving to open newsstands in 1990 and 1993, but both failed at a cost of $45,000 in savings and bank loans.
 
A Fear of Deportations, And a Need for Immigrants
 Mr. Khan and other South Asian drivers estimated that as many as 30 percent of the Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Indians driving yellow cabs in New York City may be living and working under false requests for political asylum. Exactly how many South Asians could face deportation is unknown, but taxi fleet owners warn that fewer and fewer people are interested in working as cabbies. Taxi Commission officials say fears of large-scale deportations are probably overblown, but the loss of immigrant drivers could handicap an industry that has grown dependent on cheap immigrant labor.
"We are in the process of profiling how this new law will affect this business," said Diane McGrath-McKetchnie, the Taxi and Limousine Commission chairwoman. "I'm hoping it won't have any significant impact on the T.L.C., but I'm not sure about it."
At 5:17, Mr. Khan enters Manhattan, the borough where 80 percent of yellow cab fares begin or end, the commission says. For the next six hours -- at least half of his shift -- all of his fares will go toward paying $75 in fees to the Al-Ehram taxi fleet in Long Island City, Queens, from which he rents his cab and medallion. Over time, the value of a medallion has steadily risen to about $200,000, and so has the cost of renting them.
Only 35 percent of the people who own medallions actually drive cabs; most medallions are owned by large taxi fleets or investors who buy the medallions and rent them to drivers at a profit.
As Mr. Khan speeds down a deserted Second Avenue at 5:20 A.M., it is already filled with a handful of yellow cabs prowling for passengers. At one time, Mr. Khan had hoped to buy his own medallion, but now he says he plans to get out of the business. He attributes his thinning hair to stress and said the pay is not worth the hassle.
 
'We're Easy Targets,' Says a Driver Craving Respect
 Mr. Khan complains that taxi drivers are increasingly viewed with disdain in New York City. Passengers bark orders at drivers, he said, and don't treat them with respect. "We are treated worse than animals," he said, echoing other drivers' comments. "Cabdrivers are everyone's scapegoats. We're easy targets."
He turns onto 10th Street and parks at the corner of 11th Street and First Avenue. At 5:25 A.M., he rushes through an unmarked door and enters a nondescript storefront mosque for prayers. Mr. Khan tries to go every day for morning and afternoon prayers. If he has a fare, he will pray silently in the cab, as the passenger remains oblivious to what he is doing.
But Mr. Khan's religious beliefs defy stereotyping. He does not ask his wife to wear a veil and uses the money he earns to help put her through medical school on the Caribbean island Dominica. He deferred his dream of becoming a certified public accountant to support his wife's studies, and he criticizes Islamic fundamentalists. "There is nothing in the Koran that says women should not being educated," he said. "All my sisters are very well educated."
After prayers, Mr. Khan hunts for fares on the Upper East Side, picking up his first passenger at 5:59 at 95th Street and Second Avenue. As the sun begins to rise, he listens to the 6 A.M. BBC news for a reminder of home. As the city wakes, he begins speaking with driver friends over his radio. Tips on where passengers are and where traffic is snarled are exchanged.
The next three frenzied hours are spent shuttling passengers primarily from the Upper East Side and Upper West Side to midtown, where 42 percent of all yellow cab fares begin or end. He eats no breakfast, stopping only to buy a coffee at 7:10.
His one break is a fare to La Guardia Airport, after which he sits in a holding lot with other cabs from 7:38 to 8:25. Normally, he decides the wait for a fare is too long and heads back to Manhattan empty, but on this day he stays. During the wait, he stretches his legs and reads a newspaper. By 9:05, he has dropped his airport passenger off at the Plaza Hotel and is back in midtown hunting for customers.
There has been an effort to improve the performance of the taxi industry over the last four years. The previous T.L.C. chairman, Christopher Lynn, and Ms. McGrath-McKetchnie have made changes intended to improve service, like requiring all new drivers to attend classes on geography, courtesy and basic English. Last week, Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced efforts to enforce traffic laws and said that taxi drivers would be specifically targeted.
Ms. McGrath-McKetchnie said the number of serious complaints has dropped and for the first time that she knows of, the T.L.C. is receiving more letters praising cabbies for courtesy and professionalism than letters complaining of rudeness.
But cabbies complain of an increasingly competitive marketplace where car services are encroaching on yellow cabs. They say new regulations cost them time and money, and that the police frequently blanket them with expensive tickets. But Ms. McGrath-McKetchnie points to a sharp drop in robberies and yellow cab drivers killed on the job as evidence that the Giuliani administration's reforms have also aided drivers.
Many cabbies concede that their earnings rose slightly after a 20 percent fare increase in March 1996. The T.L.C. barred fleets and medallion owners from increasing the rents drivers paid for cabs by more than 14 percent to ensure that drivers received some of the increase. Despite accusations from drivers, T.L.C. officials say surveys have caught no fleets violating the cap.
Several American-born drivers blamed South Asians for making the business more ruthless. Cabbies complained of Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis cutting them off and risking people's lives simply to get a fare. "The Pakistanis, the Indians and the Bangladeshis, they're the worst," said Francisco de la Cruz, who has been driving a cab for 13 years. "They drive like crazy. But all those things they do I think they have to do in order to survive."
T.L.C. officials say they detect no more complaints about South Asians than any other group. Mr. Khan, who has been driving for the last six years, agrees that the business is becoming more and more ruthless, but says South Asian drivers are no worse than others and attributes tensions to the steadily increasing price of renting taxis and medallions.
Like many drivers, Mr. Khan says the Taxi Drivers and Allied Workers Union, which represents drivers, is ineffective. He believes South Asian drivers could be a powerful force if they could unionize.
From 9:30 on, nearly all of Mr. Khan's fares consist of taking business people back and forth across midtown. Usually stuck in traffic, the day is a slow grind. For lunch, he grabs a chicken sandwich at the Pak Punjab deli on Second Avenue and Third Street, a favorite of Pakistani drivers.
He returns to the mosque on First Avenue for prayers at 1:30 P.M. Three more monotonous hours in midtown and finally at 4:39, roughly 12 hours after he started, Mr. Khan's shift is over. It has been a slow day, but tonight will be special. His wife is returning for a visit after four months in Dominica. He has driven 117 miles, had 27 fares with no confrontations with passengers or the police. After paying for leasing the cab, leasing the medallion and for gas, he will take home $80. Mr. Khan earned $6 an hour for a 12 hours a day. His average tip was 89 cents.
During the shift change, Mr. Khan, his partner, Sajid, and other Pakistanis drivers drink tea, tell stories of the day and joke for 15 or 20 minutes. But by 5:20 P.M., Sajid is on the road and Mr. Khan is on the subway on his way to the gym. Within five minutes, Sajid picks up his first fare at the corner of Washington and Jane Streets. He crisscrosses the Village, gets a fare headed uptown and then settles into shuttling passengers up and down the Upper East Side.
Sajid is tall and imposing, but he is soft-spoken and almost shy. He praises the United States endlessly and is desperate to stay here. "Why not, if you work and pay taxes for 5 years or 10 years, you can get a green card?" he asked repeatedly. "I have never taken welfare. I have worked hard. I have paid my taxes."
Like other illegal immigrants, Sajid put his life and thousands of dollars in the hands of an anonymous trafficker for the age-old goal of a better life for himself and later his family. At 21, he flew from Pakistan to Canada, entering with false travel documents provided by the trafficker.
After several days, he was abruptly driven to the American border. The trafficker did all the talking and handled all the documents. Sajid still does not know exactly how he got into the United States, but he arrived in New York in 1990 at the age of 21 with only the name and phone number of a friend from his home village.
 
In Search of the Holy Grail: American Citizenship
 Seven years later, his homesickness has eased, but he often thinks of his parents, sisters, brother and friends in Pakistan during the long hours of driving. A high-school graduate, he comes from a small farming village of 1,800 in the Punjab in north Central Pakistan.
In a country with an average annual income of $500, the $10,000 his family spent to get him to New York is a fortune. Much of the last seven years has been a long struggle to repay his family, and most importantly, obtain the citizenship that will allow him to bring his family to America.
At first, he worked in gas stations, where he received $3 an hour for a 70-to-80-hour week. In December 1991, he started driving yellow cabs without having a work authorization. The T.L.C. began requiring taxi drivers to prove they had work authorizations only last year.
He saved his money for four years, but lost $14,000 on two different newsstands he opened in 1995. He married an American citizen that same year and now has conditional status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has allowed him to receive a work authorization. If officials rule that his marriage is valid after two years, he will be eligible for a green card, but he fears the I.N.S. will rule against them or that the marriage will fall apart.
"Each day my mother prays that I get a green card," he said. "If God wants to give me some help, I'll get the green card."
After the string of rides on the Upper East Side from 6 to 7:25, Sajid receives a rare fare -- a passenger bound for Forest Hills, Queens. He heads for La Guardia after hearing from friends on the CB radio that lines aren't long. From 8:31 on, he continually picks up fares that have him criss-crossing Manhattan from the Lower East Side to the Upper West Side to the World Trade Center to Washington Heights.
But at 12:16 A.M., his luck abruptly ends. He is unable to find a fare for the next half hour. Dozens of cabs circle bars, clubs and movies theaters in the East and West Villages, desperate for customers. Just before 1, he gives up and heads for the highlight of his day -- dinner at his favorite low-cost Pakistani restaurant.
In a scene reminiscent of any diner, Sajid and his cabby friends talk business and tease each other. The conversation is light, but the front page of the current issue of The U.S. Asia Times features a front-page article about 71 illegal aliens being arrested in a New Jersey perfume factory.
Most South Asians are here legally, but among the illegal immigrants and the 17,000 or so nationwide who are seeking political asylum, stories like this cause widespread unease.
 
The Odds Are Long For Asylum-Seekers
 Since political asylum rules were tightened in January 1995, I.N.S. officials say they have processed nearly 200,000 backlogged cases.
Last week, officials began sending letters to 110,000 of the asylum seekers, informing them of impending interviews and asking them to give their whereabouts.
Officials say they hope to process all of the backlogged cases within the next 18 months, which could mean the loss of thousands of work authorizations and some deportations.
"We have about an 80 percent rejection rate," said Brian Jordan, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington. "Most people don't show up for the asylum interviews."
Robert Deming, a cabdriver for 16 years and a teacher at the Master Cabby New York Taxi Academy in Queens, said he has nothing against immigrants, but believes some taxi jobs must be opened up to poor Americans -- especially those who may be cut off welfare. "This is not xenophobia," he said. "I just want to see Americans supporting themselves."
With a good night already under his belt, Sajid decides to call it quits at 2:34 A.M., an hour earlier than usual. He turns on the "Off Duty" light at and heads over the Queensboro Bridge.
All together, he had driven 119 miles and had 24 fares. After paying for his expenses, he will take home $100 for a 10-hour shift. He has earned $10 an hour. His average tip was $1.04.
On the way home, Sajid bought himself a treat -- a $25 prepaid phone card to call his best friend in Pakistan.
At 3:10 A.M., he locks the door to his cab and heads for the one-bedroom apartment he shares with another Pakistani immigrant. The man, who pumps gas, just received his cabdriver license. A few miles away, Mr. Khan will soon be rising and searching for his green prayer rug. For now, the cycles and rhythms of the taxi industry, the city and American immigration roll on.

HEADLINE: The Myriad Sides Of Rent Regulation

 BODY:
THE 54-year-old rent regulatory system has grown so complex that in a 50th-anniversary report on it in 1993 the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal took 26 pages to provide a glossary of terms.
Legally, the continuation of regulation in New York City depends on a periodic finding that a housing emergency, defined as a citywide rental vacancy rate below 5 percent, still exists -- as it likely always will barring an almost unimaginable pickup in new construction, or a change in the way the rate is calculated. The periodic vacancy survey counts only "nondilapidated" rental units, and includes public housing and other governmentally assisted units, which almost always have low vacancy rates, in the calculation. 
 But the 1993 state report also states as the mission of regulation the "broad social goal" of maintaining "an adequate supply of decent affordable housing for approximately 2.5 million New Yorkers."
It is at this ideological level that the deepest split occurs. Foes of regulation say that the broad social goal would be better accomplished by a freer market, which they say would increase the housing supply, loosen the rental market, and improve existing housing through greater investment. But those who want to retain regulation say that other factors more than regulation restrain new construction, and the more important need is to safeguard the occupancy of tenants at a time of housing shortage, and prevent what they expect would be a mass exodus of middle-income people.
But the ideological issue has receded in interest before the practical issues involved in possibly far-reaching change in housing law. This year State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican Majority Leader, says he will let the rent laws expire unless the Assembly agrees to a plan that would end regulation entirely by some fixed date for all but the elderly and handicapped. The political debate that he has set in motion has obscured the issues on which negotiation may well turn.
The pricing system gets the most attention. Most regulated apartments in New York City are rent-stabilized; tenants have leases, and landlords are obliged to offer renewal leases at a rent no higher than prescribed by a quasi-governmental body, the Rent Guidelines Board.
There are still about 70,000 rent-controlled apartments in the city -- those that were built before World War II and have been continuously occupied by the same tenant or a legal successor-tenant since 1971. In many cases these tenants are now paying more rent than rent-stabilized tenants of long occupancy, because renewal-lease increases in stabilized apartments are usually well below the 7 1/2 percent a year allowed for rent-controlled apartments.
Negotiations on the pricing system could involve either occupied or vacant apartments, or both. In its purest form, "vacancy decontrol" would allow owners to charge a market rent when renting out a vacant apartment, and then to offer, or not offer, subsequent renewal leases with no control on price except market forces. In limited circumstances this already happens.
Most recently vacancy decontrol was applied to apartments in which the first legal rent after a regulated tenant departed was $2,000 a month or more. Negotiations could involve this threshold being lowered.
Decontrol also applies currently to occupied apartments, if the tenant pays $2,000 or more a month and has gross adjusted earnings of $250,000 a year for the two years before the expiration of the lease. The $250,000 threshold could be lowered. Plainly, the rate at which the housing stock is deregulated would be quicker if it applied to apartments with tenants in occupancy. But it would also be more painful to tenants.
BEYOND prices, two other aspects of the regulatory system are notable -- their effect on occupancy rights and building operations.
Current law, for example, obliges landlords to offer renewal leases to a broad array of occupants -- not just a spouse, but any family member, broadly defined. Watering down succession rights -- for example, by limiting them only to spouses of deceased residents -- would also speed deregulation, but even more, in owners' minds, restrict the current potential for abuses -- at the cost, say tenant advocates, of forcing family members out of their long-term housing.
Rent law also has a powerful impact through its effort to keep owners from worsening building services or conditions. If a landlord is found to have reduced a service that was provided on a certain "base date," the tenant's rent can be reduced and the service may have to be restored. Protection is the intent, but the side effect can be to dampen the incentives to improve efficiency and thus lower operating costs. Several other laws govern building conditions, but the state regulatory system provides the immediate threat of rent rollbacks.

HEADLINE: Imperfect Measures;
Tests, Too, Have Their Failings

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
NEW York's Education Commissioner and Governor offered opposing views last week on an issue that goes to the heart of educational quality and opportunity in an increasingly diverse America: should the state offer its college-preparatory Regents examinations in languages other than English?
The Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, was concerned that English-only Regents exams -- which New York uses to award merit scholarships -- don't fairly test the math or science skills of the state's many immigrants. But the controversy over his proposal to offer test booklets in Spanish, Haitian Creole, Russian and Chinese is only one of many cases questioning the enormous and increasingly contentious role that testing plays in American education. 
 From S.A.T. college-admission tests to President Clinton's proposed national tests for reading and math, from public schools in New York to public universities in Mississippi, this is the golden age both of testing and of disputes over how schools test, what tests measure and how fair they are.
At a time when education is seen as the essential route to opportunity, it is not just the details of specific tests that are at issue, but the nature of what the writer Nicholas Lemann calls America's evolving meritocracy, and what the legal scholar Lani Guinier calls America's evolving testocracy: the network of standardized tests that determine access to scholarships and the best schools and colleges.
"As access to educational quality, who gets a limited number of places in schools and jobs, becomes more competitive, we're seeing many of the big social issues in American life played out on the playing field of tests," said Robert Schaeffer, a spokesman for the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, or Fair Test, which is critical of the reliance on standardized tests.
 
A Search for Standards
 Across the country, educators increasingly depend on standardized tests even as challenges to their use spread. Current controversies include the following:
* In New York, supporters of Commissioner Mills's proposal say immigrants should not be penalized since the Regents are used for both high-school graduation and merit scholarships, and students would still have to pass an English Regents test. Critics say testing in other languages would deter students from learning English.
* In Mississippi, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last month that the state's five white public universities continue to discriminate against black students by using ACT college-admission scores to award scholarships. Of almost $6.9 million dispensed in 1992-93, $6.6 million went to whites.
* Mr. Clinton, in an effort to raise academic standards, has proposed what would be the first national tests, a reading test for fourth graders and a math test for eighth graders. They would not be mandatory.
* Despite persistent claims that standardized tests are culturally biased in favor of white males, the bans on affirmative action in California and Texas now have the potential to make those states, two of the nation's most diverse, more reliant on standardized tests than ever.
The role of standardized testing in American life is not a new issue. For decades many experts have argued against overreliance on what Ms. Guinier calls "one size fits all" paper and pencil tests. Many critics prefer systems in which students build portfolios of their work, or tests like the revised National Assessment of Education Progress, released last week, which has multiple-choice questions but also asks for written analyses of scientific experiments.
Why then are traditional multiple-choice tests more influential now than ever before?
In higher education, when the best colleges and professional schools are deluged with applicants, standardized tests like the S.A.T. are still seen as a cost-effective and time-effective way to sort applicants. Even if schools wanted to downplay test scores, the near hysteria about rankings like those in U.S. News & World Report's annual college guide, which penalizes colleges for low S.A.T. averages and rewards them for high ones, would argue against it.
In elementary and secondary education, the sense of urgency about improving educational quality has led lawmakers to insist on "objective" measures of performance as a way to gauge how effectively tax dollars are being used.
And the argument over affirmative action is regularly framed in terms of racial or ethnic preference versus merit -- with merit defined by grades and supposedly objective tests.
Many political and business interests agree that better measures of performance are needed, and that schools and students won't improve without a way to adequately assess their performance.
Diane Ravitch, a senior research scholar at New York University, said standardized tests have become increasingly valuable as looser grading standards have made high-school grades less useful.
"Tests shouldn't be the only thing," she said, "but a real meritocracy replaces inherited privilege with merit, so a poor kid with good test scores can in fact do better than a rich kid with bad test scores."
 
Mirroring Society Too Well
 But Mr. Lemann, who is writing a book on meritocracy in America, said standardized testing like the S.A.T. tended to reproduce, not negate, family background; for as long as there have been such tests, well-to-do children from families with high levels of education have done much better than poorer ones.
He argues, however, that there are limits to tests' power as arbiters of opportunity. Higher education in America is available to almost everyone, even if Harvard and Yale are not, so low test scores do not rule out a college education as in countries with make-or-break national examinations. And while success in some professions -- law, for example -- is closely linked to attending elite schools, in many other fields -- business and entertainment, for example -- it is not.
Still, like Ms. Guinier, he argues for a more sophisticated analysis of what tests measure and their fairness.
Ms. Guinier and a colleague at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Susan Sturm, argue in a widely circulated paper, "The Future of Affirmative Action: Reclaiming the Innovative Ideal," that the question least addressed in the national debate about affirmative action and merit is what standardized tests measure and how well they do it.
They maintain that when almost two-thirds of the people entering the work force are projected to be women and members of racial minorities, the tests in use are becoming less and less reliable and fair in apportioning educational opportunity. "The existing meritocracy creates a modern-day aristocracy that gives further advantages to the already advantaged and creates barriers for those who are not," they wrote.
The issue traverses often hidden fault lines of economic class. If tests like the S.A.T. often serve to a large degree as proxies for class, radically de-emphasizing them could dramatically redefine who gets into Harvard or Berkeley -- to the disadvantage of the largely privileged students who are admitted now.
Still, Mr. Lemann says, it's essential to remember that while tests matter, the larger issues of education and equity matter more. "You can't fix education by fixing testing," he said.

HEADLINE: Caribbean Blues;
Drugs! Aliens! Washington, Wake Up

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BRIDGETOWN, Barbados

 BODY:
IN the fifth year of his presidency, Bill Clinton is finally venturing into the United States' backyard, traveling to Mexico, Costa Rica and Barbados this week to meet with the heads of Caribbean nations. But as he opens what the White House grandly calls a "new dialogue," the discussion is likely to be defined, as always, by a decades-old dependency on one side and cold strategic considerations on the other.
In a region where the United States' main concern has forever been its own security, what is new is that with the end of the cold war, the threat of the drug trade and increased illegal immigration has replaced Communism as the Caribbean nations' basis for claiming American attention. 
 While the Clinton Administration's main objective is to rally support for its war against drug cartels, the small, vulnerable nations of Central America and the Caribbean are telling the United States that its lack of interest in the region has made the drug trade attractive for residents.
"The problem is that the United States has virtually ended its aid to us," said the Prime Minister of St. Lucia, Vaughan A. Lewis. "Not 'virtually,' " he added. "It has ended its aid to us for all practical purposes."
During the 80's, the Reagan Administration was a muscular presence, dispensing money, guns and advice with stunning prodigality, rewarding friends and punishing enemies. The resulting dislocations, including civil war, left the region more dependent than ever on the United States, which nevertheless in this decade has seemed less and less interested in developments to its south, and increasingly willing to let others -- the European Community in the Caribbean, the Scandinavian countries in Central America -- pick up the slack. During his first term, Mr. Clinton's most visible gesture there was an 11 hour visit to Haiti.
 
A Self-Defeating Policy
 "The U.S. interventionist policy in Central America in the 80's is fast turning into indifference," Sweden's Deputy Foreign Minister, Pierre Schori, warned last December in a speech that marked the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.
"This not only lets the peoples of the region down, but it is also a self-defeating policy," Mr. Schori said.
"Migration, and particularly the illegal immigration to the United States, grows," he said. "So does the drug problem. This is a visible result of the instability and lack of development."
But where Washington responded with displays of might in the 80's, whether in Nicaragua or Grenada, the Caribbean Basin is now of strategic value only to drug traffickers with bankrolls that exceed the budgets of many countries in the region. The result, Ivelaw L. Griffith, an expert on Caribbean security issues, wrote in a recent essay published by the National Defense University in Washington, is that "security today means an economic and political response, with the military playing only a supporting role."
 
Wanted: Trade, Not Aid
 But even as the drug threat has grown, in the form of marijuana farming and the shipment of cocaine, Washington's willingness to take the steps needed to counter it has faltered. Aid to El Salvador has declined to less than $50 million a year, from more than $1 billion at the height of its civil war. In the Caribbean, American economic aid has fallen 90 percent, to $26 million in 1995 from $226 million a decade earlier.
Whether they speak English, Spanish, French or Dutch, the region's leaders recite a familiar mantra: what they really want is "trade, not aid." But on that front, Washington has been just as parsimonious.
After the United States joined Canada and Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, Mr. Clinton promised the small economies of the Caribbean Basin similar access. But Congress has refused to go along, while doing away with low-interest loans for development projects in the region and forcing the closing of the regional office of the Agency for International Development in Barbados.
At the same time that Washington is pressuring the countries to step up drug interdiction efforts and to allow United States ships and planes to use their waters and airspace, it is essentially leaving their small, vulnerable economies to fend for themselves.
Here in the Eastern Caribbean, Grenada provides perhaps the most dramatic example of the United States' reduced interest. To much domestic acclaim, President Reagan sent more than 2,000 troops in October 1983 to overthrow a pro-Cuban Government; he promised a "special relationship" that would transform an island of 100,000 people into a prosperous democratic state.
During Mr. Clinton's first term, though, the American Embassy in Grenada was downgraded to legation status as part of what Washington called an effort "to shift resources to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union." Responding to that blunt reminder of its strategic insignificance, the Grenadian Government renewed its relationship with Cuba last month. It also plans to sell Grenadian passports to Chinese and Indians eager to leave Hong Kong.
"We are in trouble, we have a lot of needs, and we have not been getting support from our traditional friends," said Prime Minister Keith Mitchell.
The challenge facing the leaders who will meet with Mr. Clinton is to convince him that their nations still have "a strategic, geopolitical importance for the United States," as El Salvador's President, Armando Calderon Sol, put it in a recent interview.
He added, "If we cannot convince people in the United States of that thesis, then I must insist that the problems of the Mayan peoples of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are going to be in Arizona."

HEADLINE: The World;
Why Blair's Victory May Not Travel Well in Europe

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
AFTER Tony Blair's election victory for the Labor Party in Britain last week, the rest of the leftists in Europe found new reason for hope. Elections will take place in France at the end of this month, in Germany next year and soon after in other places across the continent where Socialists and Social Democrats have found themselves frozen out of power in recent years.
"We can do it, too," was the refrain, followed quickly by, "Of course, we would never think of doing what Labor did in Britain." Labor's sin, as some of its continental cousins see it, was adopting the pro-business, anti-government, tax-cutting philosophies that conservatives everywhere insist are the only way to compete in the global economy. 
 "The real winner of the British elections is Thatcherism," headlined the weekly L'Express in anticipation of a Labor landslide, referring to the distasteful (to continental leftists) ideology that former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her successor, John Major, used to transform the British political landscape and economy.
Thatcherism may have made the rich richer and the poor poorer, as its critics charge, but in income disparity Britain is little different from France or Germany; all have been subject to the same inexorable global economic forces. Britain, however, has distinguished itself from other countries in Europe in its change of thinking across the political spectrum about the welfare state.
No one doubts that Mrs. Thatcher and her party changed Britain in their 18 years in power, and that Tony Blair's New Labor now accepts most of those changes.
And no one doubts that economic change of some kind is badly needed on the continent. Unemployment in Britain is only 6.1 percent, but it is 12.8 percent in France, 12.1 percent in Italy, 11.7 percent in Germany and almost 22 percent in Spain.
But achieving consensus in European countries on what to do about it is all but impossible, in part because the party political spectrum is much more fragmented than in Britain, and because in most countries on the continent, proportional representation imposes a need for coalition government and broad agreement.
 
No Consensus
 Mrs. Thatcher absolutely despised consensus, and because of the British electoral system she won healthy majorities in Parliament even though her Conservatives never won a majority of the popular vote. Thus she was able to break the stranglehold that British labor unions had over the economy when she arrived in power, and she legislated flexibility in British hiring and firing practices. She was also able to cut British income taxes to a top rate of 40 percent -- about what Americans in the upper tax brackets pay on some of their income, but far less than what the richest pay in France (54 percent) or in Germany (53 percent).
Two decades later, Mr. Blair has accepted most of these Thatcherite prescriptions as essential for Britain to compete effectively in the new global economy.
Here in France, though, there is no such consensus. President Jacques Chirac keeps saying that businesses would hire more people to work for them if they didn't have to pay high payroll taxes that usually add 50 percent to the cost of every salary.
But according to public opinion polls, most people in France -- and not just the Socialist opposition -- oppose cutting these taxes if it means reductions in the generous unemployment, pension and health care benefits that everybody in France has thought of as a right, not a privilege, for 50 years. So far, nothing much has happened -- and that is one reason Mr. Chirac called for new elections.
 
Paralysis
 Paralysis is also the rule in Germany. "What is wrong with our country?" Roman Herzog, Germany's President, asked in a speech last weekend contrasting Germany with the United States and other countries that seem to have made the transition to the new global economy more easily.
"In brutal terms, the loss of economic dynamism, the paralysis of society," he answered. "Instead of producing decisions," debates turn into rituals," he went on. "At the end, the problem is usually put off. The status quo prevails. Everybody waits for the next subject."
Change is not totally impossible; in both Sweden and Germany, widespread sick-leave abuses have led to changes in the rules so that now you have to be sick for more than a day or two before you can start collecting sick pay. The number of illnesses suddenly fell dramatically in both countries. But it took 20 years of wrangling between store owners, retail clerks' unions and political parties right and left before Germany could agree last year on such a simple thing as a change in the country's tightly controlled store opening hours, and then it was only minimal.
To reduce unemployment, French Socialists and German Social Democrats prefer to keep regulating working hours, shortening them without cutting salaries. Critics say all that will do is spread work among people who already have it, without creating desperately needed new jobs for young people.
In both Germany and France, opposition parties say they will not go even halfway down the British road. They will not shift the burden of economic adjustment from the rich to those least able to pay -- salaried employees and workers. In Britain, such workers have little job security, but in the post-cold war global economy, they have an easier time finding jobs than their unemployed colleagues on the continent. Companies that find it too expensive to produce automobiles or refrigerators or anything else in France can build factories in Britain, Ireland, Poland or Hungary, or even farther afield.
In the interest of social peace, continental societies have long chosen to subsidize unemployment at public expense rather than send workers off on their bikes looking for jobs, like the British do. But meeting the tough anti-inflationary criteria set for the new common European currency planned for 1999 -- the Euro -- means that France, Italy, Spain and Germany can no longer easily rely on public borrowing to finance their welfare states.
The Euro may usher in a new era of prosperity, but those who would enjoy it have to endure a little pain first. Britain has already endured the pain. With its low unemployment rate and its budget deficit under control, Britain could easily meet the criteria for the Euro, if Mr. Blair chooses to join. Leaders in France and Germany, which aren't so sure of qualifying, may soon have even more reason to envy him.

HEADLINE: This Panel on the Media, The Media Want to Stop

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 2

 BODY:
Press freedom groups, concerned that the United Nations might be drawn into a renewed campaign for worldwide regulation of the news media, are lobbying against efforts to convene a world conference on communications gaps between developed nations and the third world.
The issue is expected to come up in two weeks when the General Assembly's information committee meets here. Although the United Nations information department refused to put what the third world calls a "new world information and communication order" on the formal agenda, a number of developing nations, led by Nigeria and Algeria, want to reopen the debate at the session. 
 The executive director of the Virginia-based World Press Freedom Committee, Marilyn Greene, said today that while media organizations do not deny that there are inequalities, it is not up to governments to decide what to do about them.
"Governments have no role in dictating to the press what the role of the press will be," she said. "That's what this whole thing is about."
When the remnants of the Nonaligned Movement met in Nigeria last September, officials from dozens of countries agreed that "the struggle for the new world information and communication order should be intensified in spite of the end of the cold war."
They reiterated familiar themes: Western domination of international news, biased reporting of third world events and a dearth of "zeal" among their own journalists "to serve the interests of member states of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries and other developing countries." Technological advances in communications in recent years have widened gaps, the officials said.
Some developing nations want to convene a "world seminar" in 1998 or 1999 with the help of Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
But the agency is not interested; in fact it actively opposes the idea. Its last foray into the subject cost it dearly. After a first attempt to establish something called a "new world information order" under Unesco's auspices in 1976, ensuing debates polarized its members, paving the way for the United States and Britain to withdraw in the 1980's.
At an international conference on global communications sponsored in April by the United Nations information department and the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, poor countries' access to high technology and journalists' use of information systems were discussed, said Anders Wijkman, assistant administrator of the United Nations Development Program, who attended the event.
Representatives of several press freedom groups, hearing that the meeting would lend support to the proposed world seminar, declined to attend and asked Leonard R. Sussman, senior scholar in international communications at Freedom House, to voice their objections in a speech to the conference.
In an interview this week, Mr. Sussman said he had told the conference that developing nations had genuine concerns about the news media in industrial nations and the runaway lead they enjoy in global communication technology. But these, he explained to participants, are separate from the desires of some government leaders to disguise control of the media as a universal cause.
"There are valid objections to the way the news is handled in the West and elsewhere," Mr. Sussman said in the interview. "But there are also some very bad cures for that. And it is these bad cures that I now see coming up in somewhat sugarcoated form."
This week, to coincide with World Press Freedom Day on Saturday, Freedom House published a study of press laws around the world by Mr. Sussman. He found that 43 countries, some of them democracies like India and Colombia, were contemplating or had introduced new legal restraints on the press. Sixty-six of 187 countries surveyed annually were rated more restrictive last year than the year before.
Leading the campaign for a new order is Nigeria's ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, who this week was listed among the 10 worst enemies of the press by the Committee to Protect Journalists. "Abacha escalated his vicious tactics to decimate the country's once thriving independent press and drive scores of journalists into exile," the committee said.
The other nine on the list are: Antar Zouabri, a leader of the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, who has made the killing of journalists a matter of policy and who ranked first among the enemies of the press; Presidents Jiang Zemin of China and Fidel Castro of Cuba; Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey; President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus; Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia; President Suharto of Indonesia; Gen. Than Shwe of Myanmar, and President Sali Berisha of Albania.
A number of diplomats and journalists from the developing world said this week that they did not believe the call for international regulation of the media stood much of a chance, in part because some of its advocates are people like General Abacha and other military rulers.
Bhaskar Menon, an Indian who publishes International Documents Review, a weekly guide for watchers of the United Nations system, says the world has changed too much to revive the regulation idea.
"I think it's a dead horse for several reasons," said Mr. Menon, who worked in the United Nations information department during the first battle over a new information order.
"One is that there isn't the political head of steam behind it that there was last time around. In the 70's, the whole atmosphere was different. The cold war was on. Developing countries, after the OPEC action to raise oil prices, felt that they had a chance to really make a change in the way the world was structured.
"I don't think that you can complain that events in other countries are not covered in the media. They are covered very well. The attitude of Western journalists has changed remarkably."

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Opposes Use Of Sampling In Next Census

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
The Senate Appropriations Committee dealt a serious setback this week to the Census Bureau, ordering it not to spend money developing statistical tools to estimate how many people are missed in the census for 2000.
The committee's action, if it is upheld by the Senate and survives a veto from President Clinton, would keep the bureau from doing what it says it must do to have an accurate census and avoid the kind of huge undercount that occurred in 1990. 
 The bureau would be barred from doing a practice run on its sampling methods next year, and it might have to abandon the long form that it had planned to mail to one household in six.
"Any delay causes us problems," Martha Farnsworth Riche, director of the Census Bureau, said on Thursday, a day after the committee vote.
Acknowledging that the committee vote "reflects a concern a lot of people have," Dr. Riche said she hoped that some lawmakers would change their minds "as the debate goes on and people become more informed" about the bureau's plans.
The prohibition on sampling was inserted into a bill providing about $8 billion in emergency relief for flood-stricken communities in the Midwest. The vote against sampling was 15 to 13, mainly along party lines, with Republicans mostly against and Democrats mostly in favor.
The full Senate may consider the measure as early as Monday.
President Clinton will veto any measure that bars the Census Bureau from using sampling, said Franklin D. Raines, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. "Without sampling, the cost of the decennial census will increase as its accuracy, especially with regard to minorities and groups that are traditionally undercounted, will decrease," Mr. Raines said in a letter to Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the appropriations panel.
An aide to the Republican majority on the panel said the Republican senators did not necessarily have ironclad opinions but "need more information." Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, also opposes the use of sampling, some people who have followed the debate said. A call to his office seeking comment on the issue was not returned.
In general, political analysts think that traditional census head-counting, without the use of sampling, tends to miss members of minority groups in big cities -- people who usually vote Democratic.
The rider in the emergency-relief bill says the Census Bureau may not use money "to plan or otherwise prepare for sampling." Strictly speaking, the prohibition affects spending only through the end of the current fiscal year, on Sept. 30.
But given the measure's broad prohibition, bureau officials fear that they will not be able to use innovative sampling techniques and that they will not even be able to use the regular long form in 2000. Because the demographic, housing and social and economic data collected on the long form are used to draw a picture of the general population, even though the form is mailed to only one household in six, use of the form amounts to sampling.
The 1990 Census is widely acknowledged to have missed several million people, many of them members of minority groups and many of them people who did not want to be counted for one reason or another.
To avoid a similar undercount in 2000, the Census Bureau proposes to use statistical sampling: once it had counted 90 percent of the households in a given area, it would use that data to calculate what the remaining 10 percent of the households would presumably be like.
Census officials have estimated that the next census will cost $4 billion. Without sampling, Dr. Riche said, it could cost as much as $1 billion more -- and be less accurate.
The arguments for and against sampling are constitutional, practical and social as well as political. The Constitution refers to an "actual enumeration," and some people question the constitutionality of sampling -- an issue the Supreme Court has pointedly left for another day.
Some people wonder how accurate sampling is. Still, it tends to be favored by local government leaders whose communities' Federal aid depends on how many people live in their areas.
If the sampling technique planned for 2000 had been used in 1990, California would have gained a seat in the House of Representatives, at the expense of Wisconsin.
In the Appropriations Committee vote on Wednesday, Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin went against his fellow Democrats and opposed the use of sampling. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, whose state's population includes a large number of minorities, split with her fellow Republicans and voted for sampling.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Is Booming After City Reinvention;
Gambling Still Reigns at the Family Resort

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
Elvis, who tested the seams of his jumpsuit here when this desert city's biggest nongambling attraction was a few over-the-hill superstars, is truly dead.
Now a fake volcano spouts flames into the night, 18th-century sea battles rage across massive concrete lagoons, and dolphins give birth in hotel pools that are smack-dab in the middle of the sun-scorched Mojave Desert. Magicians no longer saw their assistants in half; instead, the beautifully tan Siegfried -- or is it Roy? -- impales himself on what appears to be a giant thumb tack. 
 Bright lights, once the famous Strip's trademark, will not cut it in 1997. A lumpy Empire State Building and a chunky Statue of Liberty, facades at one of the newer theme hotels, share a neon skyline with a black-glass Great Pyramid, a fairy tale castle and even a water theme park. Soon a half-scale Eiffel Tower will sprout from signs for $10 surf-and-turf dinners, the new Las Vegas ascending from the old.
"I love it," said Danny Torres, a 13-year-old from the San Francisco Bay area, after seeing his first showgirl in the lobby of the Las Vegas Hilton on a recent weekend. In the new Las Vegas, tourism, hotel construction and the population are booming as civic boosters trumpet once-unheard-of ideas: come to Las Vegas and bring the children; come and retire, come and build a plant. Las Vegas is not just for gamblers anymore, the ad writers promise.
But in this city, which almost invented sleight of hand, it is natural to question how a trick is done. The people who know Las Vegas, the people who run the blackjack tables, pour the drinks and dance behind the beads and feathers, say the new Las Vegas is powered by the same machine that pushed the old one. Gambling dictates the future here.
The rest is sideshow, however grand, however loud.
"It is still a very adult Disneyland," said Ann Yendrek, a Las Vegas greeter who stands with one spiked heel planted firmly in the city's future, the other in its past. A 6-foot vision in fishnet tights, top hat and tails, she welcomed people to a boxing match at the Hilton in a voice that could make centurions at Caesars Palace throw themselves on their swords.
Aging gamblers, although accustomed to such sights, still contemplated her through a veil of cigarette smoke, even as Danny and others his age gazed at her in what seemed to be awe. Like Las Vegas wants to be, she was all things to all men.
Gambling made Las Vegas, but the city has tried hard to alter its glitter-speckled image of limousine-riding big shots, stone-eyed card players and forlorn losers with pawn shop tickets in their pockets. It is popular to talk about family entertainment and economic diversity in what has become the nation's fastest growing metropolitan area.
It is so popular that Steve Wynn, a leader of the Las Vegas resurgence, is more than a little weary of talking about it, because there is no great secret to this city's success.
"A larger version of the same game," said Mr. Wynn, chief executive of Mirage Resorts, which includes the Mirage hotel and casino and a prototype of the new, family-style hotel-casinos, Treasure Island.
"The pitch," he said, "has been modified."
Las Vegas is booming because the gambling industry is booming, because -- now that slot machines ring on Mississippi's Gulf Coast, on the New Orleans riverfront and on Indian reservations across the country -- the most over-the-top city in America has been forced to become more sensational, more accommodating. Four huge hotels have opened in the past year, and some $6 billion in hotel and casino construction is planned for the next three years. Last year, hotel occupancy rates here were around 90 percent.
"If you build it, they'll come -- if it's good enough," Mr. Wynn said.
The Las Vegas Hilton, for example, is building a virtual casino, a star ship with slot machines. It used to be Sammy Davis Jr., doing "Candy Man."
The need to be bigger and better feeds this new construction, this employment boom, so Las Vegas grows, said entrepreneurs and experts on city planning here. Some 3,000 people move to Las Vegas each month, most of them in construction, casino work or service jobs related to gambling. Suburbs have sprung up like tent cities in the desert.
"Las Vegas has shown a great deal of agility," Mr. Wynn said. "It has met change and seemed to thrive on it. That shows no sign of abatement."
"But," he added, "it is what it is."
A place to pay your money and take your chances.
"I don't come for the show," said 70-year-old Ralph Beahler, waiting for luck to smile on him, one rattling token at a time, at the $1 slots.
Mr. Beahler, a retired aircraft worker from Seattle, said he has been coming here since 1945, when he was on furlough from the Navy. It was not much fun then because he did not have any money to risk. It is that thrill, of risking a little and winning a lot, maybe enough to change his life, that brings him back.
Luck is the only magic he is looking for. What does it say about America when Las Vegas is the nation's fastest growing city?
"It tells us gambling is a very successful business," said Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a public-policy research organization in Washington.
Earl Shorter learned it early, in the back room of his Aunt Ida Lee's little nightclub in Louisiana, not far from Lake Providence.
Every Saturday night, "depending on who the sheriff was at the time," Mr. Shorter said, men gathered there with fistfuls of $1 bills and played craps. The dice tumbled across the floor, and something grand -- a palpable excitement -- swirled like mosquitoes around the room.
"I saw how people were fascinated by this game," said Mr. Shorter, a 68-year-old dealer at the craps table in the Mirage casino. "And I knew it was a business that was here to stay."
Now you can play quarter slots in Tunica, Miss., and bet the house payment in Marksville, La. Instead of being hurt by that influx of gambling, Las Vegas has prospered from it, said Mike Clauretie, a real estate professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
"You have many states that have now said gaming is O.K.," he said, adding that the nationwide acceptance of gambling has lifted the taboo once associated with Las Vegas.
People who live here do not wonder why anyone would fly across the country to gamble in the desert when most people now live within driving distance of legalized gambling.
"If you see your first baseball game on a sandlot, sooner or later you'll want to see the World Series," said Don Payne, a historian.
So instead of shrinking, Las Vegas exploded with color and choices. The casinos, more or less assured of keeping a certain number of hard-core gamblers, also reached out for the tourists who may gamble only a little or not at all. People line up by the hundreds to see the volcano explode outside the Mirage or to see the mock sea battle, complete with pirates and booming cannon, at Treasure Island, which makes only about half its money from its casino.
Las Vegas lured better restaurants -- including expensive places like Wolfgang Puck's Spago -- to supplement the conventional cheap buffets. Casinos opened bigger and better arcades as baby sitters for older children while parents played their own games. "You can send the kids their way, then sit, relax and lose lots of money," said Oscar Torres, who brought his family here from the Bay area for a short vacation. Danny Torres is his nephew.
No other state has come close to matching Nevada's population growth, and Las Vegas is the overwhelming destination of the newcomers. From July 1, 1995, to last July 1, the state's population increased 4.5 percent, some 70,000 people, the Census Bureau said. Since 1990, Nevada's population has grown more than 33 percent; the nation as a whole grew just 6.7 percent. The population of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and the unincorporated area of the Strip, is expected to grow by another 300,000 by the year 2000.
The growth has brought the usual downside. Gridlock brings traffic to a dead stop at 3:45 P.M. on a weekday, two blocks off the Strip. Crime, including gang violence imported from Los Angeles, is at a record high. The county's court dockets are filled with lawsuits against builders for shoddy construction. Water remains a long-term concern.
Economic diversity is still more a dream than a reality.
Several companies, from Levi Strauss to Ocean Spray, have opened plants or distribution warehouses here. But those jobs, in the hundreds, disappear into the massive gambling work force.
"No, I don't think people say to themselves, 'Gee, let's go live in Las Vegas,' the way they used to say, 'Let's go live in California,' " said Mr. Downs of the Brookings Institution. "I don't think it has that same kind of attraction or aesthetics. People are moving there specifically to work in these businesses," gaming and construction.
Heather Richardson, a 21-year-old hotel clerk here, said she left Saratoga Springs, N.Y., because she heard there were good jobs available in a city where the living was affordable and taxes were low. Nevada has no state income tax.
"The money and atmosphere -- I love it," she said. Even hotel maids here make $10 an hour.
No one seems to care that there are mountains here but no trees, or that the landscape is what some people would call downright ugly. People keep coming. The work is steady and the weather is good, except in the summer, when the sun bores down like it is angry at the world.
Away from the fancy part of the Strip, as the city begins to peter out into Federal stockades, military bases and older casinos, the old Las Vegas hangs on.
A sign outside the Poker Palace promises a "$3.99 Easter ham dinner." The pawn shops are open at 10 A.M. on Sunday, for the people whose luck was sleeping. In a Superpawn, a young man is trying to hock his CD's for traveling money.
Maybe the secret is to just keep trying, as Las Vegas has.

HEADLINE: A Divided Jersey City Prepares for an Election

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, May 3

 BODY:
Voters here, by most accounts, are an unyielding and unforgiving lot. In nearly three decades, no mayor has been elected to two successive full terms. But this is politics at its most pragmatic, and candidates are more likely to be judged by what they can deliver than by where they have been.
So few eyebrows were raised when a former Jersey City Mayor, Gerald McCann, still on parole from a Federal bank fraud conviction, made it known that he would be seeking his old job in next month's election. Mr. McCann was forced from office in 1992, shortly before going to the penitentiary. 
 And it seemed more from concern for the city's image than from moral indignation that people of differing political allegiances breathed easier when Mr. McCann was thrown off the ballot. The courts found him ineligible to run for office because he remains under supervised release, the Federal system's equivalent of parole.
But even after he had left the race, the former Mayor appeared to be hovering over the election like Banquo's ghost. Mayor Bret D. Schundler, who is seeking a second full term, had to be reminded during an interview that he was no longer running against Mr. McCann, a combative, strong-willed Democrat who helped jump-start the city's waterfront development during the 1980's.
With the field narrowed, the election on May 13 will be a referendum on Mr. Schundler's performance after more than four years of presiding over New Jersey's second most populous city, after Newark. It will also be a test of whether the young Mayor, once considered one of the Republican Party's brightest hopes, has recaptured some of the popularity he lost when he began making frequent out-of-town trips only months after his spectacular showing in the 1993 election.
The city Mr. Schundler runs is marked by stark contrasts, leading James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, to describe it as "a microcosm of our two-tier economy nationally."
The upper tier is represented by the gleaming office towers along the waterfront, which are occupied to near-capacity by employees in the financial services, insurance and real estate industries. From 1992 through 1995, more than 10,000 new jobs were created in Jersey City, accounting for 91 percent of the total employment growth in New Jersey's six biggest cities, according to a study by Professor Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca, a Rutgers economist, that was published in October.
Some of these workers live in new luxury apartment complexes facing the Manhattan skyline, but many are nonresidents whose offices were transferred here.
Virtually unseen by these workers as they make their way home by ferry or PATH train is the other, grittier multiethnic tier, which has lost more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs since 1975, 350 of them as recently as April 14, when a Mueller's pasta plant closed. Overall, unemployment in the city averaged 11 percent last year; the schools have not been allowed to operate autonomously since they were taken over by the state in 1989, and most job-seekers lack the education or skills to compete for office work on the waterfront. This Jersey City is trying to remain solvent in the face of an ever-shrinking property-tax base.
With Mr. McCann out of the race, Mr. Schundler will face only two opponents, both Democrats. Jaime Vasquez, a 12-year veteran of the City Council, has been a persistent gadfly but has not raised enough money to pose a serious challenge. The other candidate, Jerramiah T. Healy, former chief judge of the Jersey City Municipal Court, has the support of the Hudson County Democratic Party but has never before sought elective office. He has raised $240,000 to Mr. Schundler's nearly $1 million.
Mr. Schundler dismisses the candidacy of Judge Healy, 46, as inconsequential. But given that only 7 percent of the voters are registered Republicans and that the last Mayor to win a second successive four-year term was Thomas J. Whelan in 1969, it is possible that Mr. Schundler will be forced into a runoff. In the most recent Jersey Journal poll, conducted in early March before the campaign was under way, Mr. McCann drew 12 percent, to 38 percent for Mr. Schundler, 11 percent for Mr. Vasquez and 6 percent for Mr. Healy. The other respondents were undecided.
The powerful Hudson County Executive, Robert C. Janiszewski, recently raised $100,000 for Mr. Healy at a benefit dinner, but even some of the judge's supporters have wondered just how much enthusiasm Mr. Janiszewski has mustered for his fellow Democrat.
Publicly, at least, Mr. Janiszewski contends that Mr. Schundler is vulnerable. "The people here don't consider their neighborhoods safe, their schools good or their taxes low," he said recently. "That's a prescription for questioning what the incumbent has done."
Mr. Schundler, a former Wall Street bond trader with the build of the school linebacker he once was, became the city's first Republican Mayor since World War I by beating 18 candidates in a special election in November 1992 to fill the remainder of Mr. McCann's term. Six months later, Mr. Schundler won a full term with 68 percent of the vote, thanks in part to a large decrease in property taxes.
Initially, the Harvard-educated Mayor, now 38, twinkled in the Republican firmament, along with New Jersey's new Governor, Christine Todd Whitman. Some of that luster dimmed, however, as Mr. Schundler went on the road to promote House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract with America and to crusade for school vouchers.
In 1995, Mr. Schundler ran his own candidate against Mr. Janiszewski, and was defeated by a ratio of 3 to 1 when the Democrats successfully tarred him with the Gingrich connection. He also irritated Mrs. Whitman with an ill-fated effort to impose a payroll tax, and the two remain distant.
Judge Healy, a plain-spoken Jersey City native who recently serenaded a crowd of elderly people with a rendition of "Under the Boardwalk," is also running as much against Mr. Gingrich as against Mr. Schundler. He has portrayed the Mayor as a carpetbagger surrounded by people who "look down their noses at the folks of Jersey City." The Mayor was raised 15 miles away, in the affluent suburb of Westfield, but has lived in Jersey City since he was 25.
"In a lot of ways, Jersey City is a very provincial town," said Thomas A. DeGise, the president of the City Council, who is running for re-election on the Schundler slate. "If you didn't go to one of the high schools here, you're not cool."
As a former prosecutor, Mr. Healy has called attention to Mr. Schundler's poor relationship with the Police Department, blaming it for low morale among the ranks, a crime rate that is worse than New York's and an increased murder rate since his first year in office. (True enough, but a recent analysis of crime statistics by The New York Times found that the violent-crime rate in Jersey City declined 17 percent from 1993 to 1996.)
"The police have been angry at me for years," Mr. Schundler acknowledged, shrugging off the animosity as a predictable reaction to some of the tough measures he has imposed, including deploying more officers on the street and making them work 14 days more a year.
Mr. Healy has also accused his Republican rival of focusing on trivial matters -- dotting sidewalks with concrete planters, for example, or issuing a policy on stolen shopping carts -- while not working hard enough to lure more investors to Jersey City.
"If you look at where we're located and what we have here, the development that's gone on in the last four years has certainly been negligible," Judge Healy said.
In defense of his record, Mr. Schundler cites, among other projects, the opening last year of a printing plant for The Daily News of New York, which added 700 jobs; plans for two new hotels, and a big spurt in new housing. One of the area's biggest developers, the Applied Companies, for example, is planning to break ground next year on 1,200 condominiums and townhouses in the luxurious Port Liberte complex on Caven Point, said Joseph Barry, the company's chief executive officer.
Mr. Barry said that Mr. Schundler does not let politics interfere with business decisions, a rare trait in Hudson County. "But sometimes he doesn't understand how much the city has to get involved," Mr. Barry said. "He's learning that. His people are very competent and honest, but he needs more staff."
Leaders of the city's merchant associations also give the Mayor high marks, saying he has encouraged them to upgrade their shopping districts through a combination of private and state funds.
But even Mayor Schundler concedes that some voters may not be happy with his plan to plug a budget hole by selling a 19-acre site south of Liberty State Park -- including five playing fields and a 5,000-seat stadium -- to the Jersey City Board of Education. The city owns the site, and the fields are already heavily used by school teams.
Mr. Healy has labeled the plan "a dirty deal," and "an outrage, a boondoggle and a scam" because the sale will be financed through bonds, and taxpayers will be paying debt service on property they already own.
But Mr. Schundler describes his plan as an ingenious alternative to the unthinkable prospect of raising property taxes. Once the ball fields are in the hands of the schools, he points out, the state will incur part of the cost of keeping them up.
"If I didn't need the money, I'd give them to the schools for free," he said. "The fact is I do need the money. And any way I can reduce the overburden on the property-taxpayers of this city, I'm going to do it."

Grueling Race Reborn After 8-Year Absence

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
It has been an eight-year hiatus for the Worrell 1000, a grueling catamaran race along 1,000 miles of coastline from Florida to Virginia. But now it's back, with 13 teams expecting to push off from the beach tomorrow at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The realists among them are expecting the worst.
"You never want to enter this race with a lackadaisical attitude," said Randy Smyth, a two-time Olympic silver medalist who has won the Worrell 1000 twice. "I try to do as much preparation as I can. But you have to accept that you're a human being. In this race, you can't be overconfident." 
 The fleet of 20-foot catamarans, each with two crew members, is scheduled to finish the 13-day ocean marathon May 17 at Virginia Beach. At least one other team member is required to follow along on shore to manage gear and supplies for the twin-hulled sailboats.
With 12 checkpoints along the way, the schedule calls for mostly daylight sailing. But two overnight stages are built into the race. Lightning storms, gale-force winds and shoals lined with sandbars and rocks are common obstacles along the way. But unexpected hurdles at night are often the most terrifying of all.
"In 1987, we crashed into a shark at midnight off the coast of Georgia," the 42-year-old Smyth said. "The coastline was all dark and swampy, and we saw no lights. The impact kicked back our boat's daggerboard, which sliced a three-foot hole through the bottom of the hull. We were very unhappy." The team guided the broken boat back to shore and withdrew from the race.
Smyth and a former crewmate, Jay Glaser, still hold the race record of 99 hours 45 minutes, set in 1985. Smyth is sailing this time with 25-year-old Jason Sneed, his neighbor in Fort Walton Beach, Fla.
The race has attracted other world-class yachtsmen too. They include Gerard Loos, a European multihull champion from Holland, and Vladimir Kulinichenko, a native of Ukraine who is a veteran of two Whitbread Round the World campaigns and is now a sailmaker in Tampa, Fla. Other Worrell 1000 competitors include sailors with jobs as varied as a computer engineer, an upholsterer, a dental technician, an executive chef, a graphics designer and a private investigator.
As a sailmaker and veteran Tornado Class sailor, Smyth knows about the long, exhausting hours strapped in a catamaran's trapeze harness. The gear allows him to leverage his weight out over the side of the cat for better sailboat performance. But the stance is as unnatural as rappelling down a cliff on the end of a rope.
Smyth has learned to bag his lunch -- maybe a peanut butter and jelly sandwich -- in plastic and fasten it to the mast's rigging so it's within arm's reach. And he knows that he will constantly be doused with sea water on the trampoline-like deck of the open catamaran. Smyth wears a drysuit, a one-piece waterproof garment, most of the time.
Michael Worrell, a restaurateur from Virginia Beach who started the competition in 1976, said recently that sailors hounded him to resurrect the defunct race. For business reasons, he sold rights to the race in 1987. Two years later it fizzled out in an economic downturn.
One of the more zealous among the competitors this time is Al Levine, a fire and burglar alarm technician from Centerport, N.Y. Levine has spent the last five years raising money for cancer by putting himself out on the proverbial limb.
In 1992, he tried sailing up the coast by himself, and nearly died trying. His trapeze hiking line broke, and Levine had forgotten to clip into a safety line. He fell into the water and watched as the boat sailed away. He swam from noon until dusk.
"I got lucky because the wind was blowing on shore," he said recently. "I got to a barrier island off Charleston, and said, 'Jesus, God, you put me ashore, but there's nothing here.' I looked around, and couldn't find anyone.
"I was getting crabby by then," he added. Eventually, Levine said he flagged down a passing motorboat.
He's determined to try raising money for cancer again. But this time, it will be in the Worrell 1000.
 
MAKING WAVES
Seventeen superyachts are expected to gather in New York Harbor May 17 for the start of a 3,000-mile race from Sandy Hook, N.J., to England. The Atlantic Challenge Cup regatta is being organized in part by the New York Yacht Club. The 85-to-192-foot yachts participating will be docked ahead of time at Chelsea Piers, at 23d Street and the Hudson River in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: A Move to Restore Benefits to Some Immigrants

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
President Clinton forced reluctant Republicans to restore disability and health benefits to several hundred thousand legal immigrants as part of the budget agreement announced this week.
Budget negotiators said the agreement would provide $10 billion over the next five years to aid the immigrants, whose benefits were cut by the welfare bill that Republicans pushed through Congress last year. The immigrants' plight had become a source of increasing political embarrassment for the Republicans and for Mr. Clinton, who signed the welfare bill on Aug. 22. 
 In addition, Administration officials said, the budget agreement would provide $4.5 billion for new initiatives to move people from welfare to work. Some of the money is intended to create jobs for able-bodied adults who, under the welfare law, may receive food stamps for only three months in any 36-month period unless they are working.
In December, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the welfare law would save $55 billion from 1997 to 2002. So the budget agreement, by restoring $14.5 billion, would wipe out slightly more than one-fourth of the expected savings.
Clinton Administration officials described the restoration of benefits for immigrants as "a pretty significant victory for us." And a Republican on Capitol Hill said "a lot of Republicans will be upset" by the proposal, but he predicted that they would "swallow hard" and approve it as part of a far-reaching plan to balance the budget and cut taxes.
Under the new welfare law, legal immigrants who have not become citizens are generally ineligible for food stamps and Supplemental Security Income, a form of cash assistance for poor people who are aged, blind or disabled.
Some of the immigrants losing benefits are nursing home residents. Many have been in the United States for more than 15 years. Some fled persecution in Russia, Cuba or other countries.
The budget agreement would allow the Government to provide Supplemental Security Income to noncitizens who were in the United States before Aug. 22, 1996, and who were either receiving disability benefits at that time or became disabled at a later date. The agreement is expected to help two-thirds of the 500,000 immigrants facing loss of Supplemental Security Income benefits. It would not help new immigrants, and it would not restore food stamps for any immigrants.
Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, who is chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he was disappointed that the budget negotiators could not find a few billion dollars more to preserve benefits for all immigrants.
The Government had already sent notices to many immigrants informing them that they might lose Supplemental Security Income benefits this summer. At first, Congressional Republicans categorically rejected Mr. Clinton's proposals to restore money cut by the welfare law.
But Congressional Republicans came under pressure from many quarters. Republican governors, including George E. Pataki of New York, appealed for help. Large groups of immigrants filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the ban on benefits for noncitizens.
And Hispanic groups cited several cases in which they said immigrants had committed suicide because they were distraught at the prospect of losing benefits.
Advocates for immigrants and refugees and officials in states like New York, California and Florida, with many noncitizens, welcomed the agreement. "This doesn't help everybody who needs help, but it is an important first step," said Cecilia Munoz, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization.
The Congressional Budget Office had estimated that the restrictions on benefits for immigrants would save $24 billion from 1997 to 2002. The restoration of $10 billion, as envisioned in the budget agreement, would undo more than 40 percent of those savings.
Administration officials said the agreement provided $2.5 billion over the next five years for grants to the states to help create jobs for welfare recipients in areas with high levels of poverty and unemployment. Also, they said, the agreement includes $500 million for tax credits for businesses that hire long-term welfare recipients.

A yearlong party starts today, honoring the 100th anniversary of the melding of more than 40 local governments into the huge and populous municipality known as New York City.

HEADLINE: AT&T Takes Lead on a Plan To Cut Long-Distance Rates

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Residential long-distance telephone rates will fall significantly in the next several years under a new plan negotiated by the AT&T Corporation and the Federal Communications Commission, officials said today.
AT&T, the nation's largest provider of long-distance service, said that it would cut residential rates by $500 million in the year beginning July 1, the first substantial cut in long-distance charges in the 1990's. That translates into reductions in residential long-distance bills of 5 percent to 15 percent, the company said. 
 Sprint and MCI Communications, the two other major long-distance carriers, are expected to follow but have not yet announced the size of their reductions, F.C.C. officials said.
The rate reductions are the last major piece of a complex compromise hammered out over several weeks in intense negotiations between telecommunications lobbyists and F.C.C. officials.
The regulatory agency is to issue new rules this week that will begin to change the economics of the nation's telephone business. It will also create a multibillion-dollar fund to connect schools, libraries and health care centers to the Internet.
Reed Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman, called the pledge by AT&T to cut household long-distance charges "a huge breakthrough."
"We have been in a firefight with AT&T behind closed doors, and now the smoke has cleared," Mr. Hundt said in an interview. He said that over the next five years, after major carriers reduced their rates, 85 percent of households would see their phone bills go down and that rates for the other 15 percent would remain about where they are today.
The rate reductions by AT&T will apply to households that do not subscribe to discount packages for long-distance usage, roughly half of AT&T's 75 million customers. The cost of long-distance calls placed during the day and evening will fall by 5 percent, while late-night and weekend charges will decline 15 percent, the company said.
Mr. Hundt estimated that long-distance charges would fall by a total of $30 billion in five years.
AT&T and the other long-distance companies will get a windfall as a result of the broader plan that the communications commission is preparing to issue this week.
Access charges -- the fees that long-distance companies pay local phone exchanges for access to their customers -- -- would fall $1.7 billion in the first year of the F.C.C. plan. A large portion of that money will be reflected in lower rates, in part because the companies hope for much larger reductions in access charges in the future and in part because Mr. Hundt threatened to seek new regulations on long-distance rates if the companies did not use at least part of their savings to benefit consumers.
Although several elements of the new regulatory plan are still in flux, F.C.C. and industry officials indicated that the commission was likely to take a number of steps this week:
*It is expected to create a relatively small "universal service fund," of $3 billion to $4 billion a year, to begin paying for basic telephone service for poor, disabled and rural customers, as well as for wiring schools, libraries and isolated health care centers. The money will come from higher charges for additional phone lines in homes and businesses, as well as from new levies on wireless telephone and paging services.
*It is likely to shift roughly $4 billion in long-distance access charges, now based on per-minute rates, to flat monthly charges, which would benefit many heavy long-distance users and Internet surfers. The losers will be small businesses that make few interstate calls.
*It is expected to increase the cost of second residential phone lines by $1 a month, from $3.50, and to raise the cost of multiple business lines by $1 to $2 a month, from $5.50.
Despite all the tinkering with the plan in the last several weeks, Mr. Hundt has stood firm to avoid an increase in the cost of basic local telephone service.
Consumer advocates cheered today's announcement. Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said the plan marked the first dividend from the sweeping Telecommunications Act passed Congress 18 months ago.
"This is the first big long-distance rate cut for the average consumer in many years," he said. "We're hoping it's the first stage of cutting all the fat out of the pricing in the telephone system, both long-distance and local."

HEADLINE: New York City Celebrates A Century of Uneasy Unity

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
The Mayors of Brooklyn and New York vetoed the idea, only to be overridden by the State Legislature. Preachers in Brooklyn railed against it. The State Senate defeated it, then changed its mind.
Clearly, the welding of the modern New York City from more than 40 local governments a century ago was not easy. But as the city begins a yearlong 100th birthday party for itself today, there is a strong view that it was historically inevitable. Ruth Abram, president of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, sees the creation of the new city as a direct reaction to social, political and economic strife that had torn America since the Civil War. 
 "This deep-seated yearning for union may explain why the opponents of the consolidation of New York simply could not prevail," she said.
To be sure, there are other views, not the least being that consolidation represented a last-ditch effort by the ruling elite to cement its power in the face of waves of immigrants.
But the importance of Gov. Frank S. Black's signature on what is known as "Chapter 378 of the Laws of 1897," a three-inch thick document dated May 4, 1897, is incontrovertible.
It redefined New York from being just Manhattan and the Bronx, both then part of New York County, to include the other three boroughs -- Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island -- which were already separate counties.
The effect was an unprecedentedly large American city of 359 square miles, one whose population had instantly rocketed to 3.4 million from 2 million.
Only London, of all the world's cities, was larger. Chicago, proudly resurgent after its 1871 fire, no longer threatened to become the nation's first city.
Indeed, the new city suddenly had more people than any of the states abutting the Atlantic Ocean, and more than the rest of New York State.
"Consolidation is a tame word for such a magnificent moment," Robert Caro, the historian, said. "What we're celebrating is the moment the city received critical mass."
"It instantly created the greatest metropolis in the Western Hemisphere at the time," said Kenneth T. Jackson, chairman of Columbia University's history department. "Without this, New York would have been much less of a grand spot."
But from the perspective of some urban planners, the occasion marks nothing so much as a stalled, not to say failed, dream. Mr. Caro noted that Robert Moses, the great builder of this region's infrastructure, was one of the last to think expansively of connecting the city to great reaches in the suburbs and beyond.
Others go so far as to suggest that the lack of a mechanism to enlarge New York -- perhaps by including ever more boroughs -- has made the current city something of a museum piece at a time other American cities are pushing their boundaries farther and farther outward.
"New York was designed as a regional government," said Robert Yaro of the Regional Plan Association. "Within a generation, it was clear this region had gone beyond the five boroughs. There was and is a need for elastic boundaries."
 
Debates Will Continue Beyond the Events
 The debates will continue well beyond the flurry of events that begin today with a small ceremony at 2 P.M. at the Museum of the City of New York, where the Charter is being displayed for what is thought to be the first public exhibition of the document. An event at 11:30 A.M. tomorrow at City Hall will include as many 100-year-old New Yorkers as can be rustled up, as well as a big birthday cake.
More events will follow next year. There will be museum exhibitions, lectures, seminars and an official tourism campaign. A 10-hour documentary on New York history, produced by Ric Burns, will be shown on the Public Broadcasting System. The Board of Education plans special courses on New York City history.
The Convention and Visitors Bureau has created a logo and plans a national ad campaign for "New York History Year."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani boasts that the celebration comes at a time when New York has bounced back, citing lower crime and increased tourism. "This is a very wonderful time for the city," he said. "At the time of our hundredth birthday, we are witnessing a great renaissance."
Plans for a performance of the "Jubilee March of the Greater New-York" by W. C. Parker, believed to have been performed only once, have been reluctantly postponed until Jan. 1, 1998, the centennial of the date on which consolidation became effective.
"Put it this way," explained Schuyler G. Chapin, Commissioner of Cultural Affairs. "The piece cannot be learned overnight."
Nor can the many questions still swirling around consolidation be easily answered. The basic arguments of proponents were that greater population would increase business opportunities, lead to lower taxes because of economies of scale and create employment through more extensive public works. The Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York was the strongest supporter.
"Consolidation was pushed by people who wanted to have a business-led development of the region," said David C. Hammack, a professor at Case Western University and a respected student of the period.
 
Hard to Exaggerate The State of Disorder
 Mr. Hammack said that it was hard to exaggerate the disorder of New York at the end of the 19th century. All of Manhattan south of Canal Street was a smelly traffic jam of horse-drawn carts. Brooklyn and the Bronx lacked paved roads. Queens and Staten Island were agricultural lands desperate for development money.
But to 19th-century reformers, cleaning up politics was as urgent as improving the physical structure of the city. Instead of 40 separate municipalities, it was felt one city would be easier for legislative and journalistic watchdogs to monitor for corruption. Moreover, a specific problem in a single locality might be repeated elsewhere. As a current example, Mr. Hammack cited the way the tragic fire at the Happy Land Social Club, in which 87 people died in March 1990, led to a crackdown on such establishments all over the city.
On the other side, some of the opponents were people content with smaller, more localized government. Some distrusted the repeated arguments that they would pay lower taxes. Brooklynites, in particular, did not want to lose an identity whose roots extended into the 17th century, almost as far back as Manhattan's.
Some of this opposition was rooted in nativist disdain of immigrants. "We don't need the political sewage of Europe," proclaimed Richard Salter Storrs, a prominent Brooklyn Congregationalist minister.
There are questions about what if any difference consolidation made in the lives of ordinary people. "For the average person in New York in 1897, working-class tenement dwellers, it's not clear to me it made much difference," said Daniel Czitrom, a Mount Holyoke College history professor who is writing a book about the period.
But the issues surrounding consolidation have never vanished. Robert R. Macdonald, director of the Museum of the City of New York, says he intends to use the anniversary as an opportunity "to think about New York -- past, present and future."
He wants to examine why people have always left New York, even as others have come. Why, he asks, do people in Queens and Brooklyn still refer to Manhattan as "the city"? Why does New York City charge tolls on some of the bridges within its city limits, something Mr. Macdonald believes may be unique?
All these questions come down to municipal identity, something people in this city either take for granted or joke about.
Robert A. M. Stern, the architect, noted that the competition with Chicago was important. That city had just staged the Columbian Exposition in 1893, an enormously influential event New York was first supposed to host, then botched because it could not come up with a site.
Chicago's population, already 1.7 million, seemed to be growing faster than New York's, a particular annoyance because the Great Lakes economy had been stoked by the Erie Canal, financed by New York capitalists.
Even more important, Mr. Stern said, was the establishment of "the centrality of New York," which he said was reflected in the new homes of such grand institutions as the New York Public Library, whose founder, Andrew Haswell Green, was also the most prominent mover behind the new city.
But what Mr. Stern called "a grand civicism" was not without its darker side. "The old WASP establishment was recognizing that for the first time it wasn't in the driver's seat," he said. "This was a last-gasp attempt to impose the Anglo culture on the whole city."
Consolidation is also an example of the sort of forward thinking, often not a little grandiose, that has long characterized the city. Mr. Burns, the film maker, points out that in 1811, the city mapped the whole city in grid pattern, even though it was almost entirely farmland. Then in 1857, it created Central Park when the site was the northern point of habitation. From 1924 on, Robert Moses, holding a succession of state and city jobs, remade the parks, roadways and bridges of the metro area.
"This city was created by great extra-territorial thinkers," Mr. Burns said. "It was done on a macro-cosmic scale."
It is the sense of grand design that Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society, suggested is lacking today, although he thinks great ideas are urgently needed in areas from new rail tunnels to parks. "It's no longer fashionable or encouraged to have grand visions," he said. "If being so huge is to be worth it to New Yorkers, then massive new visions for the future have to be articulated."
Whether this means an even bigger city, or just better means of regional cooperation, is unclear. Mr. Yaro points out that three of the state's largest cities are now in the process of moving many governmental functions to the county level.
"Buffalo, Utica and Syracuse are saying their cities don't work anymore," Mr. Yaro said. "Their metropolitan regions are much bigger, and they don't have the tax base."
As a collection of counties, New York City is clearly different than cities that are smaller than their counties. But Mr. Yaro noted that cities like Houston, San Diego and Phoenix have become the nation's trend-setters in continually expanding their boundaries so as not to lose their populations.
At the same time, Mr. Yaro said, the fact that one-third of the region's population resides in the city, an effect of consolidation, guarantees the city more political clout. By contrast, he said, the proportion is one-tenth or less in Detroit, Boston and other cities. "This means New York hasn't been marginalized," he said.
The question before New Yorkers is whether they can keep the spirit that prevailed when the city came together as one a century ago.
On Jan. 1, 1898, The New York Tribune proclaimed, "The sun will rise this morning upon the greatest experiment in municipal government that the world has ever known."

A Compromise for 2002: Balancing the Federal Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
President Clinton agreed on Friday to a compromise plan with Republicans to balance the Federal budget by 2002. Whether the plan will be enacted as written remains unclear, and murkier still is the question of whether it would actually eliminate the deficit in five years.
But as a political document, the agreement was quite an accomplishment, encompassing compromises on sweeping ideological issues like the size and role of the Government (it will get slightly smaller) and on specific programs. 
 Mr. Clinton gave up $58 billion in spending on domestic programs, $12 billion more than he wanted, but got money for his main priorities, including health insurance for poor children, restoring welfare benefits to legal immigrants, expanding the Head Start program and providing tax breaks for college students. Republicans got the tax cuts they have been clamoring for, including breaks for families with children and a reduction in the capital gains tax.
Where's the pain? Most of it was masked by a rapid decline in the size of the deficit, which this year is running at $75 billion, the lowest level in more than two decades, thanks largely to a booming economy.
"Under this budget agreement," said Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader, "official Washington must learn to make do with less, while Americans will keep more of what they earn, and they will be able to save it and invest it in their own families." RICHARD W. STEVENSON

U.S. Economy Keeps Booming

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
The economy has been chugging along recession-free for more than six years, but it is now roaring down the track. Economic output grew 5.6 percent in the first quarter, the strongest performance since 1987, the Government said last week. The momentum carried over into April, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent, the lowest rate in 24 years. 
 Remarkably, inflation has remained contained. But with the jobless rate so low, employers will likely raise wages to attract workers, putting upward pressure on prices. The result will almost certainly be more interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve to cool things down. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

HEADLINE: In Budget Battle, Advantage Goes to G.O.P. Chairmen

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
With a broad agreement in hand that promises a balanced budget, the deal-making has shifted from President Clinton and Republican leaders to a new set of negotiators, the Capitol Hill tax writers and appropriators who will make it law.
For weeks, leaders of both parties have wrangled over the budget, but in the next few months, control of that process will rest solely with the Republicans who control Congress. And it is at this point that interest groups will turn on the real pressure. 
 Much of what happens next will depend on the guidance of four Republican committee chairmen in the House and Senate, each of whom brings a different style, temperament and agenda to the table.
And none will attract more attention than Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, who will have considerable control over important issues like the size of cuts in the capital gains tax and the estate tax.
Mr. Archer, who represents one of the nation's six wealthiest districts and who prepares his own tax returns, will have the principal responsibility for writing some of the most sweeping Federal tax cuts in recent history.
He has already made his presence felt. Budget negotiators said that as their talks reached a crucial point this week, Mr. Archer stepped in and flexed his political muscle by insisting that his committee have the largest say on the size of certain tax breaks, a move that temporarily stalled a final agreement.
After more than a quarter-century on Capitol Hill, Mr. Archer is the longest-serving Republican in the House of Representatives. He is a savvy veteran of budget fights and one of the most passionate anti-tax crusaders in Washington.
"Crucial tasks lie ahead," Mr. Archer said. "The Ways and Means Committee will write the policies and determine the details necessary to carry its part of the budget resolution into law."
In his radio address today, President Clinton asked Congress to approve a balanced budget plan worked out in negotiations with leaders of the Republican-led Congress.
 "Let us now reach across party lines and seize our chance to balance the budget," he said of the plan reached on Friday to balance the budget by 2002 and cut some taxes.
 Under current budget rules, whenever Congress makes a tax cut, the resulting loss in revenue must be made up by either raising another tax or by cutting entitlements.
The negotiators agreed to offset $50 billion of the proposed tax cuts by renewing the airline ticket tax and airport fees -- which would generate about $30 billion in revenue -- and by closing some tax loopholes.
The rest would have to be taken from entitlement programs. Senior Democratic aides with the Ways and Means Committee have said that Mr. Archer has already informed his Republican committee members that he is considering making up some of the money by trimming the low-income housing credit. The program, which gives tax credits for investments in low-income housing, could provide up to $17 billion in savings, Democratic aides said.
The Constitution dictates that all tax legislation must originate in the House of Representatives. And because the Ways and Means Committee is the tax-writing panel for the House, its chairman has traditionally exercised wide latitude over what legislation gets beyond the committee and the size of any tax cuts.
Spending plans also originate in the House, and that means that the Appropriations Committee and its chairman, Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, will share the spotlight.
Mr. Livingston talks tough and is given to boisterous, arm-flailing outbursts, but he has also shown a knack for rigorous fiscal belt-tightening. In the previous Congress, the so-called "cardinals" who controlled the 13 appropriations subcommittees under his direction saved $50 billion by cutting spending on social, housing and education programs. They killed nearly 300 such programs. Mr. Livingston has said he does not expect deep cuts in discretionary programs other than defense this year. But he warned of some cuts this week.
Both Mr. Archer's and Mr. Livingston's tasks will be complicated, but not stopped, by the senior Democrats on their committees.
"I do not believe a majority of the Democrats in this caucus are going to vote for this turkey," Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the Democratic leader on the Appropriations Committee, thundered after Administration officials floated the tentative plan at midweek.
Even after seeing the sweetened finished product, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, was still unconvinced. "The people who benefit from the tax cuts are not my constituents," Mr. Rangel said.
In the Senate, which usually looks to the House appropriations bill as its spending blueprint, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the Republican chairman of appropriations, will hold sway over spending.
Mr. Stevens is often hot-tempered and eager to battle the Democrats over spending.
The Finance Committee, led by Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, will help with tax-writing on the budget.
Mr. Roth is a kindred spirit to Mr. Archer when it comes to cutting taxes. He and former Representative Jack Kemp co-wrote the 1981 Kemp-Roth tax-reduction bill. He was named chairman of the Finance Committee in September of 1995.
Robert D. Reischauer of the Brookings Institution, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the greatest problem area for these men might be Medicare payments. Under the agreement, projected spending on Medicare would be reduced by $115 billion, or 8.5 percent, in the next five years, mostly by cutting payments to medical providers and increasing many Medicare premiums by $1 a month.
"Here you can expect to see the Ways and Means, Finance and Commerce committees struggle," he said. "They are going to be under immense pressure from the provider interests. The only significant blood that has been drawn in this budget deal is from hospitals, doctors and other medical providers."
In the new lineup, it is Mr. Archer who will have the most control and command the most attention.
Chosen in 1970 to succeed Representative George H. Bush in the reliably Republican, highly affluent Seventh District of suburban Houston, the affable and quiet-spoken Mr. Archer has always shown a zeal for tax-cutting.
"The less taxes the better; the smaller Government the better" is a favorite political mantra of Mr. Archer, a 69-year-old lawyer who boasts of his frugality and of paying cash for his houses.
Mr. Archer took a back seat to Speaker Newt Gingrich and others in the bruising budget fights of the last Congress. But in late December, he went to the White House for a one-on-one meeting with President Clinton that both men described as a "courtesy call" and not a budget negotiation.
Still, Mr. Archer's visit gave notice to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gingrich and all other interested parties that he was an important player.
The Clinton Administration and the Republican budget negotiators have agreed on how much they should cut taxes, a maximum of $85 billion in the first five years and about $165 billion in the ensuing five years. They have agreed to cut the capital gains tax and estate taxes, and to implement a $500-per-child tax credit, an Administration-backed tuition tax credit, credits for companies to clean up abandoned industrial sites and a tax break of some sort for District of Columbia residents.
But officials involved in the first round of the budget talks said that one of the last sticking points was Mr. Archer's demand that his committee have the right to set the size of the various proposed tax cuts.
That impasse was broken when Republicans agreed to guarantee that $35 billion of the tax cuts would go toward the Administration's tuition tax credit plan and that Mr. Archer's committee would decide how the remaining $50 billion in tax cuts should be appropriated.
Mr. Archer has been one of the most vocal advocates of reducing the capital gains tax and the Federal inheritance tax. But he has been ambivalent about the $500-per-child tax credit. Mr. Archer is also one of the leading proponents in Congress of replacing the Federal income tax with a national sales tax, although that issue is not part of the current package of tax proposals.

HEADLINE: Opening a Window to the Inner Souls of Artists, in a New Novel

BYLINE: By MARJORIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
FERNANDA EBERSTADT grew up with a gold Marilyn Monroe silkscreen by Andy Warhol in her parents' Victorian living room on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Warhol was a close friend of her parents, Frederick, a fashion photographer, and Isabel, a writer and the daughter of the poet Ogden Nash. 
 One summer when she was 16, Warhol employed Ms. Eberstadt at his "Factory" to write for Interview magazine. "The Factory was my intensive introduction to the New York art world's ruthless merchandising of talent," Ms. Eberstadt recounted in a recent interview.
Although not a painter, art is important in her life. "Eberstadt loves art, all sorts of art," said Roxana Robinson in a very favorable critique in The New York Times Book Review on March 30, "and writes about it with joyful comprehension."
Religious imagery, like her childhood collection of icons from trips to Europe, resembles the art created by the protagonist of her third novel, "When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth" (Knopf).
The figure, Isaac Hooker, 26, from a provincial New Hampshire town, is a Harvard dropout writer who becomes an artist in the 1980's glitzy art scene in New York. He finds a benefactor and a lover in the wealthy Dolly Gebler, who runs an arts foundation with her husband, Alfred.
Speaking in Huntington, near where her father grew up at Target Rock, Ms. Eberstadt said the Geblers were not based on her parents. But in the book, New York's high society art world becomes a metaphor for the relation of art to religion.
"Unlike other forms of culture," she said, "art has become a commodity, and it has a religious side. People trade art, but they also worship it."
A sequel to "Isaac and His Devils" (Knopf, 1991), "Sons of Heaven" is as much Dolly Gebler's story. She is a woman who sees artists as messiahs. "She had acquired the belief that money must redeem itself from its gross origins and be converted into the immortal tender of lasting works," the writer said.
By the novel's end Isaac offers "a cautionary tale to young artists, don't come out of nowhere and burn too bright, learn to last."
"Jean Michel Basquiat," Ms. Eberstadt said, "was an artist who began his career sleeping in a cardboard box and spray painting graffiti in subways and who died at age 28 from a heroin overdose. I remember seeing him once at a party. I've never forgotten it. He was blocking a staircase, making out with a blond girl. No one could go up or down the steps. There was such magnetism about him. He was so magical."
Although Isaac may seem like "a white Basquiat," Ms. Eberstadt said, she invented him more from sources like Samuel Johnson. In 1982, Ms. Eberstadt was one of the first women to graduate from Magdalen College at Oxford, achieving the highest degree awarded that year in English literature.
"Oxford was a revelation to me," she said. "I had been an alternately wild and dowdy teen-ager, daydreaming, morbid, overshadowed by hipster parents and a brilliant older brother, Nick, who, modeling himself after our paternal grandfather, had become an economist at Harvard."
Religious overtones pervade not only her fictional world. "Consciousness of divine presence is a tune that always runs through my head," she said. "Sometimes a drone, sometimes in perfect pitch."
Art, words and religious imagery collide in a brilliant burst of color, texture and truth in "When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth." The title, taken from Genesis, is a nod to the biblical metaphors of another period. "Throughout the book," Ms. Eberstadt said, "there are many references to the Old Testament's time of excess before the Flood, when the heavenly creatures mated with the earthly." It is also the title of Isaac's first series of allegorical drawings.
Dolly is an example of "how a patron can kill an artist's work by becoming too proprietary." She provides Issac with the luxury of time and paint at her summer home on the North Fork, Goose Neck, and converts him into a salable success in SoHo, but at the same time jeopardizes his creative vision.
Ms. Eberstadt wrote part of the novel while in a rented house in Southold. Her descriptions of driving between the East End and Manhattan combine wit and lyric: "Then like a musical composition introducing a new motif, the first burst of farmland asserted itself, vying with shopping mall."
The view across the Peconic from the North Fork becomes "a benign semi-sequesteredness, a blurred ambidexterity of land and sea."
But the center of the book, Ms. Eberstadt, said is not so much a satire of what occurs when a hefty price tag is placed on artistic vision as much as it is a story of revelation, and where it comes from and how it disappears. "If you inflate a living artist's reputation," the writer said, "the exposure can destroy the work."
To prepare, Ms. Eberstadt, enrolled in a drawing class in London, where she and her husband, Alaistar Bruton, a British political journalist, and their daughter Maud, 2, named for the Tennyson poem, live in addition to New York.
The couple met in 1992 in Istanbul, where Ms. Eberstadt was on assignment for The New Yorker, and were married the following year. She also writes literary criticism and essays.
"The drawing class was the most physically demanding experience I have ever had," she said. Writing about painting was probably the most challenging, she said, because painters and writers see the world so differently.
The only thing clear in Ms. Eberstadt's alternately solemn and wild childhood was that she would be a writer. Her parents were a mixture of uptown high society and downtown funk, she said. As patrons of avant-garde theater, film and music in the 60's, their parties went down in social history, and her mother's dresses of feathers, vinyl and fur hang in the Museum of the City of New York.
"Very early," the writer said, "I saw writing as my job. School always got in the way. I just never got it, was never good at it."
But her parents always took her writing seriously. "Even before I was old enough to write," she said, "my mother used to write my words down."
At 11, Ms. Eberstadt dropped out of the Brearley School. "That year we lived in the Bahamas," she said, "and I completed my first novel. I read and read and read, everything, including the entire Bible. I made intricate lists of the characters' genealogy."
Growing up without parental guidance or boundaries for religion, sex or drugs was scary, she said.
Words were the only sure thing she knew. "I remember always having a fascination with words and playing word games with Papa [Ogden Nash]," Ms. Eberstadt said. " Words, words in love with them, wanting to swallow the dictionary. We spent summers in New Hampshire, and every day he would read out loud what he had written that morning. He also read out loud "The Hobbit," wonderful old fairy tales and books by Lloyd Alexander, to me, my brother and our cousins. He was a very gentle, sweet mild man with a beautiful gentle voice."
"Sons of Heaven" is written not so much as a satire on pretentiousness in the New York art world as a lush kaleidoscopic "journal to God," she said.
"Isaac," Ms. Eberstadt wrote, "was learning to paint in a way that showed the faith, the tenderness, the suffering in things. To capture the inner radiance. Which meant learning how to see with the heart's inward eye. Painting to make people believe."

HEADLINE: Coalition to Gather Food in Drive on Hunger

BYLINE: By LINDA TAGLIAFERRO 

 BODY:
SAYING that unemployment, budget cuts and welfare changes are straining hunger-relief efforts, a coalition of groups is planning to participate, for the first time, in the third Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive, on Saturday.
The drive is being organized by the National Association of Letter Carriers as part of a national effort. 
 The Long Island groups include Help for the Poor, the Interfaith Nutrition Network, Island Harvest, Long Island Cares and the Long Island Volunteer Center. A spokesman for the agencies, Msgr. Thomas Hartman of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, said:
"Long Islanders more readily associate hunger with New York City. But in fact there are 600 soup kitchens on the Island. The need for food will be even greater when welfare reforms come through. The nature of this need cries out for all the agencies to help each other."
Lynn Needleman of Long Island Cares, a food bank that started in 1980, said that when Long Island suffered through a recession in the 1990's she noticed that her agency was increasingly helping recipients from the middle classes.
"Unemployment figures can be misleading," Ms. Needleman said. "Even if unemployed workers find new jobs, they may be offered lesser salaries. After they pay their rent or mortgage, many people are finding that they are in need of food."
Social agencies today, she added, are frequently sought out by people who had been donors, meaning that donations have decreased while the demand has increased.
Based on her experience, she said, at least 300,000 Long Islanders need food.
Contributors are asked to leave new nonperishable foods in cans or plastic containers in bags near their mailboxes for letter carriers to collect. The items will be taken to warehouses for sorting for the charities.
All post offices on Long Island will also have donation bins.
The chairman of the drive for the letter carriers, Rick Hubert, said, "We are looking for staple foods such as pasta, soups, tuna fish, cereals and vegetables."
In 1995, Long Island led the nation in donations, with 1.4 million pounds. Last year donations reached 1.9 million pounds, and the goal for Saturday is two million pounds.
More than one million postcards are being delivered on Long Island to notify residents about the drive.
"There will also be 26,000 posters announcing this event," Mr. Hubert added. "The letter carriers' union has 5,000 active members on Long Island. And they look forward to this drive every year. They start planning in November, and some workers even come in to help on their days off."
The Long Island district manager for the Postal Service, Thomas Rossati, said:
"This is a cooperative effort, and we're utilizing our people to network, to facilitate the spirit of giving on Long Island. Our drivers, clerks, supervisors and mail handlers will all facilitate this phenomenal effort."
Linda Breitstone of Island Harvest thanked a number of companies and organizations for their assistance.
"Lilco gave us volunteers and their media expertise," Ms. Breitstone said. "Danny Lehner, who owns Inflight Newspapers, managed to get a donation of a forklift for us. Waldbaum's and King Kullen are donating hundreds of thousands of plastic bags, and Jack Price of Price Paper is giving us an additional 5,000 bags. The Nassau County Bar Association's We Care Fund donated $3,000 for milk crates."
Warehouses are needed, and Picone Realty is donating the use of one in Calverton. Reckson Associates, the real estate giant, is donating the use of a warehouse in Hicksville for two months.
"This is a huge donation," Ms. Breitstone said, "because the site contains over 175,000 square feet, and there are 12 loading areas."
People who want to volunteer to help can call the Long Island Volunteer Center at 294-5482.
"We have to make sure that we don't send baby food to senior citizens or gourmet foods to children," Ms. Breitstone said. "This is a massive effort, and we need the warehouses to store the food until it can be delivered to the respective agencies.
"I used to have a faceless concept of who these needy people were, and then I realized that they're all my neighbors and just like me. We would all want someone to reach out to us, and we should all reach out to them now."
Information about the food drive is available from Island Harvest at 294-8528 and Long Island Cares at 435-1936.
In a related collection, a group called Rock and Wrap It Up! is gathering food for the remainder of the school year on Thursdays and Fridays at George Hewlett High School in Hewlett.
Hewlett is the first school in what the group hopes will be a national effort to raise food for the needy. The organization was started by Syd Mandelbaum of Lawrence, who began by collecting leftover food from musical groups at rock concerts.

HEADLINE: DEVELOPMENT;
Taking the State Master Plan Beyond Paper, Into Action

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
When the New Jersey Development and Redevelopment Plan was adopted in 1992, it was widely hailed as a pioneering blueprint for managed growth, one of the most advanced of several statewide efforts in the country. The plan, which was nonbinding, offered local governments the tools they needed to turn the tide of suburban sprawl, concentrate development in town and city centers and preserve vanishing farmland and open space.
Five years later, the only thing that seems to have changed in New Jersey is that not too many people are excited about the state plan anymore. Farms are still disappearing at a rate of 10,000 or so acres a year, developers are still happy to show towns just how permissive their zoning ordinances really are and cities are still complaining that all the economic development is going to their suburbs. Only about 5 percent of towns have tried to make their own master plans consistent with the principles of the state plan. And despite the fact that state put the plan together based, among other things, on suggestions from each of the 567 municipalities, most local governments don't seem to know quite what to do with it. 
 Now, in accordance with state law, the plan-making process is about to begin all over again. Later this month, the staff of the State Planning Office expects to finish a draft of a new version of the plan. The draft will be sent to every local and county government, and for the next two years, state and local officials, developers and environmentalists will work out the details, tussling over the definitions of "environmentally sensitive" and "town center" and expanding "principles" into "key concepts."
But critics of the plan say that without any enforcement power and without sufficient state money to help towns achieve the plan's goals, the next version is not likely to change (or preserve) the landscape too much more than the present plan has.
"The state absolutely must get more proactive," said Barbara Wolfe, a former mayor and current planning board chairman in East Amwell, a Hunterdon County township that is trying to hold on to its largely agrarian identity. Without state-imposed tax incentives and penalties to keep growth where it should be, the township has very little leverage, she said. And without the state backing it up, she said, East Amwell dare not tighten its zoning for fear of sparking lawsuits from farmers and other landowners whose property values would plummet if a 30-acre tract zoned for 10 homes was suddenly allowed only one.
On Monday, the New Jersey Audubon Society and the state Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs started a petition drive for a state plan that would make areas designated "rural" or "environmentally sensitive" not just places where local governments might want to consider discouraging development, but also places where the state will not tolerate development.
In New Jersey, with its fierce tradition of home rule (not to mention a powerful builders' lobby), such a proposal is about as likely to win broad support as a turnpike toll increase. But Bill Neil, the Audubon Society's Assistant Director for Conservation, said that extreme situations demand extreme solutions.
"The voluntary people have had their day," he said. "They've had a model out there for five years and it hasn't worked."
Thomas Dallessio, the Public Affairs Manager for the State Planning Commission, which is coordinating the plan revision, said, "If the public truly believes that there's a role of state government to limit the development in rural areas, they need to let us know."
The current state plan is a 185-page book of land-use guidelines accompanied by volumes of technical papers. It gives chunks of land one of five planning designations, from densely populated urban districts to environmentally sensitive, off-limits areas. It encourages local governments to designate "centers," concentrate public investment in sewers and roads in those centers and discourage growth outside the centers.
The state has passed laws to make the plan work better. One passed last year allows landowners to transfer density from parcels in low-growth areas to parcels better suited for growth, even if they are not contiguous. And in 1995, Governor Whitman ordered state agencies to use the state plan as the basis of their decisions whenever possible -- giving preference, for example, to sewer permit applications or requests for street upgrades within town centers.
In the next version of the plan, Mr. Dallessio said, the commission hopes to include specific goals -- to preserve a certain amount or percentage of farmland or natural habitat, for example.
But whatever happens, Mr. Dallessio said, will be the product of statewide consensus. "That's the beauty of the process," he said. "We cannot mandate from the state what planning gets done on the local level. The public will implement the plan because the public helped write the plan."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 4 about the state master plan paraphrased the position of Bill Neil, the Assistant Director of Conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, incorrectly. He did not say that problems with enforcement of the state plan had created extreme situations requiring extreme solutions. A letter explaining the society's position appears today on page 19.

HYSTORIES
 Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Culture.
 By Elaine Showalter.
 244 pp. New York:
 Columbia University Press. $24.95. 
 The theories of Sigmund Freud are the crabgrass in the lawn of cultural criticism. Scientists, philosophers and research psychologists have been trying for decades to dynamite the tenacious stuff, poison it or pull it up by its roots, but it keeps coming back. The plump and juicy metaphors of Freudian analysis are just too appealing to many literary critics, because they account nicely for any topic under scrutiny -- on a post hoc basis, that is. The fact that three Freudians will analyze the same person or phenomenon in three different ways never fazes Freud's supporters, any more than does the fact that three movie critics will review the same movie in three different ways. But that is precisely why Freudian metaphors appeal to literary critics and exasperate scientists, and why this book will do the same.
Elaine Showalter, a professor of English and president-elect of the Modern Language Association, has written a spirited Freudo-literary analysis of what she calls hysterical epidemics and what social scientists call emotional contagions or mass psychogenic illnesses. Her six examples are chronic fatigue syndrome, gulf war syndrome, recovered memories of sexual abuse, multiple personality disorder, satanic ritual abuse and alien abduction. She knows full well that throwing the first three into the mix will "infuriate thousands of people who believe they are suffering from unidentified organic disorders or the aftereffects of trauma." She braves not only their wrath, but also that of the feminist therapists and writers whose "credulous endorsements of recovered memory and satanic abuse" have contributed to these epidemics. This attitude alone is worth the price of the book.
It may seem odd and unduly provocative that a scholar who has written about misogynistic attitudes in medicine would retain the word "hysteria," laden as it is with muddled meanings and antiwoman baggage. But Ms. Showalter wants to reclaim "hysteria" as a universal human response to conflict, anxiety or sexual desire. When these strong feelings cannot be expressed directly, she argues, they are transformed into a vast and shifting array of physical symptoms or delusional beliefs. Hysteria is a culturally permissible language of distress, used by those who are otherwise mute or silenced. A man who cannot admit he is afraid can legitimately complain of having a headache; a woman who is afraid to acknowledge her sexual fantasies can legitimately claim she was abducted by aliens who subjected her to "probes."
Hysteria becomes epidemic, Ms. Showalter maintains, through the spread of culturally fashionable narratives, which she calls "hystories." A hystory is picked up by the news media, talk shows, self-help books and the Internet; named and validated by medical or psychological experts; and given a congenial reception by society. "Multiple personality disorder," for example, was sparked by the media's obsession with sensational cases, like that of "Sybil"; endorsed by psychiatrists, who then went looking for it in their patients; perpetuated by the growth of professional groups, journals and treatment centers devoted to it; and welcomed by feminists who saw it as the ultimate consequence of women's victimization and loss of self.
Some aspects of these epidemics do lend themselves beautifully to literary study. For example, Ms. Showalter traces the similarity between popular forms of women's pornography, such as the "soft-core rape fantasies of bodice busters," and the erotic scenarios of women who say they have been abducted by aliens. And she shows that when therapists and doctors express surprise that their patients independently tell the same story -- of what an alien looks like, of "memories" of a ritual massacre of babies and goats -- they are failing to recognize how common these "plot lines" are in our culture.
The "hysterical narrative," Ms. Showalter tells us, has become a growth industry in literary criticism, emerging "at the busy crossroad where psychoanalytic theory, narratology, feminist criticism and the history of medicine intersect." Normally I would think it unfair to fault her for staying in the ethereal territory she knows and not moving on down the road. But the Freudo-literary tradition is not just an intellectual exercise for the flexing of academic muscles; it has had powerful and pernicious effects on people's lives. Indeed, discredited Freudian theories and invalidated methods, along with the widespread ignorance of the difference between scientific research and clinical/literary opinion, have contributed to three of the very epidemics she discusses -- recovered memory, multiple personality and satanic ritual abuse. This is why Ms. Showalter's approach, while often informative, suffers from three fundamental flaws.
The first is that it loses its grounding in the circumstances and realities of people's lives. Sometimes a headache is a "language of distress," and sometimes it's a tumor. Because Ms. Showalter sees hystories as an unwitting collusion between troubled victims and sympathetic experts who offer a clear reason for the patient's unhappiness (it's all due to your dad, the aliens, a yet-unnamed disease, a government conspiracy), she allocates no blame to either side. "Hystories are constructed," she writes, "by suffering patients, caring psychologists, dedicated clergy, devoted parents, hardworking police, concerned feminists and anxious communities."
Indeed, but such narratives are also constructed by vested interests protecting their professions and incomes, ignorant psychologists, greedy opportunists who see a way to make a fast buck on the insecurities of the vulnerable, ideologues of the right and left, and clergy and politicians drunk on the elixir of moral righteousness. By not also identifying the venal motives that support epidemics, let alone their economic, social and political supports, Ms. Showalter implies that they are merely psychological phenomena, reflecting people's efforts in scary times to reduce anxiety. So they are -- but they are also big business.
Second, while Ms. Showalter correctly alerts us to the medicalizing of problems caused by strong emotions and psychological stresses, she overlooks an equally common diagnostic error: the psychologizing of problems with organic causes. Until the bacillus that causes tuberculosis was identified, TB was thought to be a result of having a "tubercular personality." Until the bacterium that causes peptic ulcers was identified, ulcers were said to be caused by repressed anger -- still a favorite psychoanalytic culprit. In California, a woman spent 12 years in therapy, her muscles getting steadily weaker until she couldn't lift her hand to brush her teeth. The psychiatrist said that her problem was her "repressed rage" at her parents; she turned out to have myasthenia gravis, a progressive muscular disease.
In this context, Ms. Showalter's discussion of gulf war syndrome is both informative and limited. "War makes people sick," she says succinctly. The sickness has had different names -- shell shock, war neurosis, post-traumatic stress disorder -- and taken different forms, but it is caused by the terror, stress and unpredictability of battle. After World War I, she writes, men across Europe complained of "limps, loss of voice, paralyzed limbs, headaches, amnesia, incapacitating insomnia and emotional distress." An English military doctor, not wanting to accuse British soldiers of being "hysterical" (i.e., weak and womanly), suggested that the symptoms were caused by the physical or chemical effects of exposure to an exploding shell; hence the term shell shock. Today, as then, Ms. Showalter argues, veterans are hostile to the idea that any aspect of their suffering might be psychological.
By tracing the similarity of veterans' symptoms -- so vague, so diverse -- across time, Ms. Showalter makes a convincing argument that emotional contagion and panic are a big part of gulf war syndrome. For example, some veterans attribute their babies' respiratory problems to the syndrome, but studies find the rate of these infants' problems to be no higher than usual.
Yet, as recent news reports have shown, it is not irrational or hysterical for veterans to believe that they might have been exposed to chemical toxins in the gulf war and that the Government has been lying to them. (Government agencies do not have a sterling record of voluntarily revealing their deadly blunders.) Similarly, although many of the people who claim to have chronic fatigue syndrome are probably suffering from depression and other normal maladies of modern life, it is unlikely that all of them are. In the absence of medical certainty, the belief that all such symptoms are psychological in origin is no improvement over the belief that none of them are.
Finally, the deepest flaw in Ms. Showalter's book stems from her confusion about the difference between the empirical tradition of psychology and the literary one of Freudianism, and her persistent mistaken equation of psychotherapy with psychoanalysis. She acknowledges the devastating new criticism of Freud and his work, agreeing that he pressured his patients "to produce narratives congruent with his theories," thereby eliciting "confabulations rather than actual memories"; and that his treatment of Dora, the classic case of hysteria, was bullying and unethical. But then, in a dazzling non sequitur, she attacks the critics who made the world aware of Freud's failings as "anti-Freudian zealots," concluding that "whatever the assaults of academics and renegades, artists and writers will continue to cherish Freudian insights." This is like saying, "Whatever the evidence of biologists and physicians, artists and writers will continue to think that repressed anger causes ulcers."
The Freudian-literary alliance thus perpetuates a fuzzy-headed antipathy to evidence and logic in the name of post-modern relativism and "narrative analysis": if all stories are equally therapeutic and valid from the storyteller's point of view, who am I to judge them? In the final analysis, so to speak, that is the attitude that contributes most to the spread of hysterical epidemics. "I have no idea if my client was really subjected to satanic ritual abuse," one therapist told her colleagues at a conference. "My job is to believe her." This is nonsense. Therapists don't have to believe their clients, or believe that there is only one truth, in order to teach their clients to think critically about their lives, to look for the evidence for their beliefs and to examine many reasons for their unhappiness.
Ironically, Ms. Showalter makes a vigorous case that not all narratives are equally therapeutic or true, that we must rely on clear thinking and evidence to protect us from the lure of emotional contagions and irrational beliefs. For all the problems I had with the specifics of her argument, therefore, I am grateful for her resounding call to arms against the witch hunts, delusions and follies of our times.

PROMISED LAND,
 CRUSADER STATE
 The American Encounter
 With the World Since 1776.
 By Walter A. McDougall.
 286 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $26. 
 In the 1990's the United States does pretty much what it pleases in world affairs. No longer do conflicts with Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union compel one choice rather than another. No longer does another superpower's possible reaction have to be taken into account; all rivals for global reach have fallen by the way.
Like a successful businessman when he retires, the United States is faced for the first time in a long time with the question of what it wants to do. It isn't just that we wonder whether to intervene in one trouble spot or another abroad, or whether to extend NATO's boundaries. It's that we haven't decided what foreign policy goals we think we can achieve, or that we think we ought to be trying to achieve, now that we can more or less do as we like.
The United States does have foreign policy traditions to guide it. But they sometimes contradict one another. Another problem, according to Walter A. McDougall, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, is that Americans persist in being mistaken as to what their traditions are. In "Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter With the World Since 1776," he sets out to disentangle, clarify, restate and reassess the fundamental principles of American foreign policy. He is aware that others have been down this path before him: that explanations, though made clearly, have been almost immediately muddled, ignored or forgotten. So it is on a note somewhere between weariness and exasperation that he writes: "Let us try, one more time, to set the record straight." And he does so vividly and powerfully in this first-rate book. Mr. McDougall's sensible account of American foreign policy from Washington to Clinton tells it as it is, and as it was.
Mr. McDougall explains that the United States in the first century of its existence pursued four sound but misunderstood doctrines in the realm of foreign affairs. The first was to build a uniquely good society: the city on a hill, setting an example for the rest of the world. Mr. McDougall claims that it was in this respect -- in domestic policy -- that the Founding Fathers intended us to be exceptional. According to him, they did not expect us to be exceptional in foreign policy. In a dog-eat-dog world, they themselves played as rough and tough as anybody else, and meant for us to do the same.
The second doctrine was to contract alliances with other countries only on a temporary basis. The Founding Fathers warned that we can't entirely rely on allies. Allies don't share our particular domestic politics and interests. Over the long term, therefore, America must play a lone hand. This is unilateralism, Mr. McDougall points out, not isolationism.
The third and fourth of our original doctrines were to expand within the Western Hemisphere and its oceanic approaches, and to forbid the European states to do so. Of course, in the 19th century we weren't powerful enough to effectively warn off the Europeans, even within our own hemisphere; but Secretary of State John Quincy Adams was shrewd enough to realize that in their own interest the British, though gnashing their teeth the whole time, would do it for us.
These four doctrines take us to the 1890's. Mr. McDougall approves of them all because they showed such a keen realization of our limitations and of the realities of the world in which we lived. But in the 1898 war with Spain, we started to go wrong. Those in the realist tradition, Walter Lippmann and George Kennan among them, have thought so too. Where Mr. McDougall departs from them is in what he thinks President William McKinley and his colleagues did wrong. He argues that their mistake was to crusade to free Cuba. His basic theme is that in foreign policy the United States should not try to right the wrongs done by others to others.
What he approves of is what many have deplored: the taking of the Philippines and the acquiring of coaling stations to project American naval power across the Pacific. But he doesn't believe the United States should have pretended to be acting unselfishly. He can justify the policy of imperialism but not the hypocrisy in which it came wrapped.
Mr. McDougall discerns the emergence of three more American policy doctrines in the century between McKinley's 90's and ours, and finds them more of a mixed bag than the previous five. Wilsonianism, by which he means the preaching and launching of crusades to change the politics of other countries, he regards as an almost unmitigated disaster. On the other hand, he approves of our defense of the balance of power in Europe and Asia, in the two world wars and the cold war. But he has no sympathy at all for the policy he calls "global meliorism": the attempt by our Government to bring market economies and other elements of our domestic polity to foreign countries. These, he argues, are things they must do for themselves. Taking his stand with those like George Kennan and J. W. Fulbright, who have urged that we cut back on what they perceive as overcommitment on our part, he stresses the limitations of our wisdom, of our power and of our ability either to understand or to change others. He recommends that our Government "abolish all its do-gooder agencies."
Maybe Mr. McDougall is right in arguing that we can't remake other countries. But what if it is in our vital interests to do so? What if it turns out that unless we see to it that Mexico achieves honest, effective government and fairly distributed wealth, tens of millions of Mexicans in the next century will flood across the frontier and bring down the southern United States in chaos? Or what if we must force other countries to put environmental concerns ahead of enriching themselves in order to keep them from poisoning our part of the planet as well as theirs? Or if, in our own interests, we need to keep murderous fanatics in the Balkans or the Middle East from behaving like themselves?
In other words, what do we do if we find -- as I think that we will, more and more, in the years to come -- that to protect ourselves and our interests we have to do what Mr. McDougall tells us we can't do? That the author can't, or at any rate doesn't, answer the question reflects no discredit upon him. That he doesn't ask it is perhaps a shortcoming.

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Factions Weigh In on Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
There must be a reason so many of the World Wide Web sites about Hong Kong open with a scene of that city's skyline.
Not that there is anything tedious about the view south from Kowloon toward downtown Hong Kong. Despite the prohibition on big blinking lights (to avoid distracting airline pilots), Hong Kong's panorama of steel and glass has long been one of the more beautifully crowded urban vistas. 
 But as the jewel of the British Empire prepares to be remounted in a Chinese setting, Hong Kong's skyline may be one of the few aspects of the place that is certain not to be changed after sovereignty shifts to Beijing on June 30.
And the fact that perhaps not everything is up for grabs may be a comforting thought to Web designers of all political flavors.
As put in a candid and readable essay on the American Chamber of Commerce's Hong Kong site: "In Hong Kong, there is widespread cynicism about the real intentions and agenda of the British colonial rulers in the final days of the transition. Paradoxically, there is also concern that Hong Kong will become a de facto colonial outpost of P.R.C. interests, with less autonomy than hoped and agreed."
P.R.C. stands for People's Republic of China, and China's official Hong Kong Web site, when it can be reached, makes quite clear the view that the territory should have been part of the P.R.C. a long time ago.
But beyond the flattering portraits of China's hand-picked leaders for the new Special Administrative Region, the press releases showing popular support for cutbacks in civil liberties and the clock counting down to the hand-over, the most interesting thing about the official China site is its roster of advertisers.
One day last week Intel, I.B.M., Eastman Kodak, Microsoft and U.S. Robotics all offered "warmest wishes for the prosperity of Hong Kong." Bay Networks and Oracle went further, "commemorating the return of Hong Kong to the motherland."
The ad for Mitsubishi Motors, a Japanese company, was pointedly different, "commemorating the return of Hong Kong to China."
Whether or not China is the motherland appears to be of little concern to the British Government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which runs a Web site that is almost wry in its resigned but dubious attitude about the hand-over.
Hong Kong's civil authorities are much more enthusiastic. The Hong Kong Government and Trade Office's in San Francisco has a Web site that offers a wealth of business information and gives the impression that the hand-over will be little more than an administrative detail. Likewise, the Hong Kong Tourist Association assures visitors that English will remain on street signs and that visa requirements will not change.
The Hong Kong Government's information site offers next to nothing of the territory's history, but includes a long section dedicated to explaining "myths and facts" about the change-over.
For example, fact 16 says (in part) that "public demand for the democratic process to stay on course and develop after 1997 will be irresistible."
That is not much comfort to those who fear Chinese rule.
Emily Lau, a pro-democracy Hong Kong legislator who is almost certain to lose her job after the change-over, runs a site that is half personal campaign literature and half general human rights advocacy. The Hong Kong Democratic Foundation, which appears to be more libertarian think tank than political action group, also has a site.
The Hong Kong Democratic Party and pro-democracy groups called Frontier and the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in China, among others, run extensive Chinese-language sites.

All About Maggie

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
There are only two facts to keep in mind about the British election: The winner was Margaret Thatcher. The loser was Margaret Thatcher. Everything else is just commentary.
How so? The ultimate triumph in an ideological war is when you convert your opponent, and if there is one theme that ran through this election it was the degree to which the British Labor Party has been converted to the basic principles laid down by Mrs. Thatcher since 1979, when she began transforming Britain from a sluggish welfare state to a fast, market-driven economy. Almost all the principles of Thatcherism -- breaking the unions, privatizing state industries, lowering income taxes, catering to the bond markets, improving competitiveness for a global economy, and fiscal austerity -- were shared by both Conservative and Labor candidates. Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, had it right when he remarked that Labor's Tony Blair and the Conservatives' John Major were engaged in "synchronized swimming." 
 It was by adopting the basic economic principles of moderate Conservatism that Mr. Blair was able to win back, in a landslide, the working-class voters who had abandoned Labor-socialism for Thatcherism in the 1980's. The Sunday Times reported that at a Blair rally in Leicester a heckler from the old socialist wing of Labor shouted at Mr. Blair, "You're a Tory!" (a Conservative). A Blair campaign aide responded by directing his staff toward the heckler: "Try to get the cameras on him. He's worth a thousand votes."
Mr. Blair is not alone. Mrs. Thatcher's basic model is being mimicked all over the globe now, and for that reason she belongs in the pantheon of great revolutionaries of this century. Mrs. Thatcher should be remembered as "The Seamstress of the Golden Straitjacket." The golden straitjacket consists of all the Thatcherite principles that a country has to adopt today if it wants to tailor its economy to the demands of the local and global markets. But what happens when a country puts on the golden straitjacket is that its economy grows and its politics shrinks -- all political choices are reduced to Pepsi or Coke, nuances of style, tone and substance.
That's why politics in every industrial democracy today consists of two trends: There is anti-straitjacket politics, which is Buchanan in America, or the Communists in France. They refuse to put on the Thatcherite straitjacket, because they believe their countries will lose their identities or their workers will be too tightly squeezed. Or there is straitjacket politics, which is Labor and Conservatives, Democrats and Republicans: They agree that the straitjacket is the only way to survive economically, and what they fight about is how much, if at all, to adjust the straitjacket to ease the pain on those most pinched by it.
Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party lost this election because while they had the big things right on the economy, they lost sight of the many adjustments that were needed to sustain the political base for their economics. They were unwilling to adapt the straitjacket at all. Mr. Major was quoted in one campaign diary as complaining that he was "bored to death saying his mission was to help the have-nots." It showed.
Exit polls found that a key reason voters switched to Labor was their concern about the widening gap between rich and poor in this country. They know they need Thatcherism to thrive in a global economy, but they want more social checks built into it to reduce the cruelty of markets and to preserve a sense of community. And Mr. Blair played to that by promising to stop Conservative efforts to privatize communal institutions -- from public education to health care to the London subway. Mr. Blair says he will invest more in these institutions, establish a minimum wage and maintain fiscal discipline.
Just as President Clinton has tried to come up with a kinder, gentler Reaganism, Mr. Blair has promised a kinder, gentler Thatcherism -- a straitjacket with elbow room and padded shoulders. Many would argue that President Clinton failed to find that new synthesis -- that market forces were simply too powerful -- so he was reduced to volunteerism summits and balanced budgets. Mr. Blair will now try his hand. This is a big experiment. If he can succeed -- a big if -- he can be as much a model for others as Mrs. Thatcher was in her heyday.

TV Makeover in Romania: It's Not Just Cosmetic

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania

 BODY:
On Anca Toada's first day back at her former television station, she received what in the old days would have been a routine though unwelcome telephone call. The parliamentary protocol officer demanded that the nightly news remind legislators to show up for the next day's session.
Ms. Toada, once a prominent news anchor who, with her crisp look and smart presence, is as familiar to Romanians as Diane Sawyer is to Americans, curtly refused. 
 "I told him television wasn't responsible for keeping the legislature's day book," said Ms. Toada, who quit her job as anchor in disgust three years ago and has returned as the national editor at the station for what she hopes will be a new era in Romanian broadcast journalism.
Several months into remolding the news programs on the Government-financed television station, Ms. Toada, 29, and her boss, Alina Mungiu, 32, are counting the small victories. The big ones are coming hard.
In few other countries in Eastern Europe was television so heavily manipulated by the Government, and so much despised by viewers, as in Romania when it was ruled by the Communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.
Turgid pictures and droning coverage of the dour Mr. Ceausescu and his iron-fisted wife, Elena, provided much of the fare. Pseudo-cheerful folk dances provided ersatz contrast.
For some heady days during Mr. Ceausescu's violent overthrow in December 1989, it seemed that TV Romania, as the station is known, might become a model of freedom of speech. The news studio broadcast the revolution live. But after a street battle that spilled into the lobby of the station, the forces of another Communist, Ion Iliescu, took
over the Government -- and the station.
For seven years, Mr. Iliescu's television was not much different from Mr. Ceausescu's. Perhaps nowhere else in Eastern Europe had Government television changed so little after the fall of Communism.
One of the first pledges of the new President, Emil Constantinescu, a staunch anti-Communist who defeated Mr. Iliescu last November, was to give TV Romania a free hand.
But Ms. Toada and Ms. Mungiu are finding that old habits persist. The parliamentary committee in charge of the communication media demanded that all news conferences of political parties be broadcast, no matter how much propagandizing there is.
When Ms. Mungiu moved into her corner office soon after Mr. Constantinescu's victory, she discovered a telephone, decorated with a decal of the national emblem. A holdover from Communism, it served as a hot line from the presidency and Parliament, an easy way for politicians to badger editors while the news was still on air. In April, in another small victory, the line was finally cut.
Ms. Toada, who started as an idealistic young reporter after Mr. Ceausescu's ouster, rose to be the star news reader on TV Romania. She abruptly quit in 1994 when she became so embarrassed by the propaganda that passed as news that she said she was "ashamed to go out."
"On one occasion I had to read seven pages from the Foreign Ministry on why they were upset with the Hungarians," she said.
Ms. Toada went to France for a while and came back to Romania to work at a small commercial channel. When Ms. Mungiu, a prominent anti-Iliescu journalist who recently completed a year's study at Harvard University's government department, was appointed news chief, Ms. Toada decided to return to TV Romania with expanded editorial responsibilities, although she still sometimes appears as anchor.
"I returned because public television has to regain its credibility and prestige," she said, as she looked over the story list for the next newscast. (It included coverage of King Michael, who had been barred from entering the country by the previous Government.)
For the most part, Ms. Mungiu and Ms. Toada said, many of the reporters and editors at the station were holdovers from the Ceausescu era, trained to be subservient to the Government and, in the cases of some, to report to the domestic intelligence services.
Many viewed their calling in life as keeping Mr. Iliescu in power, or at the very least faithfully reporting his policies, Ms. Mungiu said. The station's correspondent covering the Balkan war, for example, invariably appeared on camera wearing a Serbian military uniform. The Iliescu Government backed the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
But, Ms. Mungiu mused, the Communist training also taught people to be "very opportunistic." When she took charge at the station, the anti-Milosevic street demonstrations in Belgrade had been in full swing for a week, but not a word or picture had appeared on the news in Romania. After Ms. Mungiu assigned the reporter to go back to Serbia and cover the protests, he did so, she said, using the same compliant behavior he learned in the past.
Extremely low salaries presented another problem: an ingrained tradition of accepting gifts to supplement poor pay.
"There was a big fuss when we said reporters could not accept presents worth more than 10,000 lei" -- about $1.25, Ms. Toada said. "One reporter got up and said, 'I.B.M. offered me a personal computer and I accepted it because I can't afford it on my salary.' "
For much of what they want to do -- carry live broadcasts, raise salaries -- the two editors are hamstrung by limited financing from the Government, a legacy from the Communist era that is difficult to change as Mr. Constantinescu tries to salvage the Romanian economy, Ms. Toada said.
"A rich television is an independent television," she said. "A poor television station can be exploited."
For TV Romania, 70 percent of the budget comes from the Government and 30 percent comes from viewers' license fees.
Ms. Mungiu was able to attract a new face as anchor for the nightly news, a sprightly, 22-year-old computer programmer, Andreea Gheorghita. But the studio where she delivers the news -- the same place where the December 1989 battle went on -- feels much like a dungeon. The walls are painted black, and the lighting equipment is more than 20 years old. The result does not put Ms. Gheorghita in her best light on camera. Some money was actually found in the budget for new cameras.
"They are the latest, and very fine quality, but they are designed for cold light and good makeup," Ms. Toada said. "We had hot lights and cheap makeup, which when you put it on tends to melt."
Another small victory: the makeup was improved, helping Ms. Gheorghita live up to her potential.

HEADLINE: Worldwide, People Live Longer, Often in Poor Health, U.N. Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 4

 BODY:
Medical advances mean more people around the world are living longer lives, but bad habits mean they are not necessarily healthier and happier ones, a new United Nations report said.
The World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, warned that what it calls "diseases of the rich" -- cancers, heart attacks, strokes and other illnesses in which diet and lack of exercise are often believed to play a part -- are on the rise in poorer countries. The increase, it said, could be attributed to longer lives and changing life styles. 
 "Longer life can be a penalty as well as a prize," the group said in its World Health Report 1997. "A large part of the price to be paid is in the currency of chronic disease."
Thanks to medical progress, life expectancy is averaging 64 years in third-world countries and reaching 80 years in some industrialized nations, the report said. But it added that millions of people throw away the chance of a healthy old age because of sedentary life styles, bad diet, smoking and alcohol abuse.
Trying to improve the health of the elderly is of crucial economic importance, it said. In the next 25 years, the population of people older than 65 is likely to grow by 82 percent, compared with 46 percent in the working-age population and only 3 percent in newborns.
Still struggling with ailments linked to poverty, third-world countries are now facing the added burden of increased rates of heart disease and strokes, which killed 15.3 million people last year and are already the leading cause of death in many industrialized nations.
Cancers killed 6.3 million people worldwide in 1996, and there were 10 million new cases reported, not all of them fatal. The number of cases is expected to at least double in most countries in the next 25 years, the report said.
The agency said the increase in cancer was caused in part by the elimination of other fatal diseases, which lengthened lives and increased the odds of getting cancer. But it also said much of the cause was diet and, above all, cigarettes.
Smoking is on the increase throughout the third world and accounts for one in seven cancer cases worldwide, it said.
Long the leading cancer killer among men in industrialized countries, lung cancer is now the top cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States, killing 375,000 of them in 1996. The number of cases among women in the European Union is expected to increase by a third in less than 10 years, it said.
The agency said the risks of getting cancer in third-world countries were smaller but growing. The reasons for the rise are unclear, it said, although the main factor appears to be longer life expectancies.
The report also said that from 1995 to 2025 the number of people with diabetes will grow from 135 million to 300 million, with a resulting increase in kidney failure and blindness, a rise it again attributed to more sedentary life styles.

HEADLINE: Roll Film! Action! Cut! Edit, Edit, Edit.;
Turning Rough Takes Into Summer's Big Hits

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
Jan De Bont, the director of "Speed 2: Cruise Control," a mega-budget action sequel due this summer, was at a film lab in Los Angeles at 7 A.M. last Thursday, to review color corrections.
It was the start of a 15-hour day, about the 60th consecutive workday for Mr. De Bont since filming ended in late February. From the lab, he drove to a Hollywood scoring stage where a 70-piece orchestra was recording music for "Speed 2." 
 The director had a working lunch in an editing suite in Santa Monica, returned across town to the scoring stage, then hurried back to the editing suite. There, he reviewed film of computer-generated effects shots generated by two specialty companies for the film, which stars Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric and is set on a hijacked cruise ship instead of the can't-stop bus of the original 1994 "Speed."
"By that time it was 10 o'clock, you're exhausted and have to go to bed," Mr. De Bont said. "At the end of each day, I have a major headache."
These are Hell Weeks in the movie business, the frenzied period before the release of summer blockbusters, when armies of workers perform the technical tasks that go by the name of post-production: editing, scoring, sound mixing, digital effects.
Little understood outside the industry, post-production is essential if raw footage shot on a set is to be alchemized into a polished movie. The laborious process has traditionally taken longer than the 20 or so weeks of actual filming on a major studio release.
But in recent years, the incentive to crunch post-production schedules has increased as studios, like Oklahoma claim jumpers, advance the release dates of movies to avoid competition from other films, or to earn a quicker return on investments. And digital technology has given some studios the impression -- falsely, according to many involved -- that the pace can easily be quickened.
The panic is greater than ever this year, as the major studios plan to release 15 or more films, many heavy with digital effects, between mid-May and August.
Post-production for "Speed 2" was squeezed to 15 weeks when the release date was advanced from late July to June 13. "It's enormous pressure," Mr. De Bont said. "You have to double the crew size."
The director said 20th Century Fox, the distributor, was worried that movies opening later in the summer would have little chance to find audiences or even theater screens.
Post-production is also causing migraines for the $180 million "Titanic," the most expensive movie ever made. Workers on the film, which is directed by James Cameron, say its July 2 release date cannot help but be pushed back by the demands of editing miles of footage.
"We're going to bring in the tents and the cots," said Gloria Borders, the general manager of George Lucas's Skywalker Sound in northern California, who plans to hire 50 sound editors next month instead of the customary 6 to work on "Titanic." "It'll be like going to work on Desert Storm."
Still, not all summer "event" movies are producing the same kind of stress as "Speed 2" and "Titanic."
"Men in Black," a $90 million science fiction adventure comedy starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, finished filming last July and has had a comfortable post-production schedule. "You can speed up post-production, hire more guys and stay up 20 hours a day," said Barry Sonnenfeld, the director. "But you won't do as good a job."
But an 11-month post-production such as that for "Men in Black," which will open July 2, is a luxury almost unknown in the summer-movie business today.
Instead, at special-effects shops like Mr. Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic, in editing rooms at Hollywood studios, and at independent "post" houses throughout the Los Angeles area, the same work habits common to Silicon Valley prevail: 80-hour weeks, catnaps on office cots, trips home lasting only long enough to assure spouses that the film worker has not run off.
Although there is a general sequence to post-production, the tasks overlap, particularly on films with shortened schedules.
Ideally, once the director has shouted, "It's a wrap!" an editor reviews the multiple takes of each scene and splices them together. A rough version of the film then goes to a composer, who writes a score; to digital-effects houses, which insert computer-generated aliens or tornadoes into filmed scenes with actors, and to sound editors, who clean up background noises and re-record muddy dialogue with the actors in a studio.
Finally, sound mixers marry the many tracks of dialogue, sound effects and music together.
In these high-speed days, these tasks routinely are shortened by hiring more people and renting more equipment, dividing up the work among teams. The problem then is coordination: with many tasks proceeding at once, changes made by one team must be instantly accommodated by the others.
Like the end man in a game of snap the whip, those at the tail end of the post-production process, like composers and mixers, find it hard to hold on for the ride.
"While we're working, every day they're cutting," said Chris Ward, a music arranger on "Speed 2," who must revise the score to fit each newly edited scene. "It makes the process a little crazy."
"Everybody is frantically trying to get pictures into the marketplace," said Ron Burdett, chairman of the International Teleproduction Society, a trade group of 300 companies in the United States involved in the technical end of film-making.
No statistics on post-production are kept, but the number of workers in both production and post-production in Los Angeles climbed to 30,000 last year from 22,000 in 1993, according to the American Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
Not all are pleased with this situation. "People are working more consecutive days and longer days, to the point where it has serious health ramifications as well as serious home-life ramifications," said Ron Kutak, executive director of the Motion Picture Editors Guild.
The risk of long days was dramatized in March by the death of an assistant cameraman, Brent Hershman, who drove into a telephone pole after a 19-hour workday on a set near Los Angeles. Petitions to limit days to 14 hours have been signed by many post-production workers as well as those involved in shooting.
But the campaign for a 14-hour day remains controversial in an industry where most workers are freelancers who welcome the chance to earn overtime. "I think more people are opposed to capping hours at 14 hours a day than in favor of it, even in the wake of this tragic accident," Mr. Kutak said.
Sitting amid the technical clutter of his trade in his temporary "offices" in a post-production house in New York, Mr. Sonnenfeld said recently that the pressure to shorten post-production is driven in part by the studios' need to recoup high costs. "More and more films rely on visual effects, and they cost more money," said Mr. Sonnenfeld, whose films include "Get Shorty." "Because they cost more, they have to be released sooner because of the carrying costs of the money."
Several studio executives disputed this. "We try and make our films as economically as possible, but we don't try and finish a movie quickly in order to recoup our investment," said David McCann, senior vice president of post-production for Walt Disney Motion Pictures and Television. The post-production schedule for Disney films -- 22 weeks for most live-action films, 26 weeks for musicals or films with visual effects -- has not changed in a decade, he said.
Others in Hollywood said the studios that most often squeeze post-production are Warner Brothers, Fox and Paramount, the ones best known for big-budget action movies.
Post-production crews working on "Titanic" are being told to aim for a late-July release, even though the two studios making the movie, Paramount and 20th Century Fox, have not yet announced the expected delay. The July 4 weekend is one of the year's busiest moviegoing periods; when "True Lies," Mr. Cameron's last movie, missed its July 4 opening in 1994 and was delayed until late July, the estimated loss was $30 million, according to Steve Newman, the film's former publicist.
Mr. De Bont said that when he started making "Speed 2" for Fox last year, the studio set an approximate release date of late July. When the studio decided to open in early June, it figured the overtime and other expenses to rush out the movie would be close to $5 million, including $3 million added to the approximately $15 million budget for computer-generated effects. Other costs included renting three sound-editing stages instead of one, additional computer work stations, and overtime for almost all involved.
But the expense is justified in the studio's eyes, the director said, because of the potential gain in ticket sales if the movie can be established as an early hit, setting up a long summer run.
To make the earlier opening, Mr. De Bont had to give up a 10-week grace period that is granted directors as basic editing time, under rules laid down by the Directors Guild. "I had to basically make a cut in 4 weeks, otherwise nobody else could start anything," he said.
And the omnipresence of computers, once billed as a time-saving boon, has not helped much.
In the old days -- three or four years ago -- editors cut and spliced strips of celluloid on motorized machines like the Moviola. Now, at Sound One, the largest post-production house in Manhattan, which fills six floors in the Brill Building, several Moviolas gather dust in a corridor, as quaint-looking as foot-treadle sewing machines. Today the process is almost all digital.
Once film is shot and processed by a lab, it is scanned by a computer and converted to digital files. Almost all picture editing now is done at computer work stations made by one of two companies, Avid Technology and Lightworks.
"Directors are given the Avid and told, 'Because of release schedules we want you to deliver your cut in four weeks,' " he said. "Studios made large investments in electronic editing systems and they were sold a bill of goods because they were told films could be cut faster. Films cannot be cut faster because human beings don't think any faster."

Chart: "It's Crunch Time for Movies"
When the cameras stop rolling, post-production work begins. In "Speed 2: Cruise Control," this polishing time was cut by about three weeks. Here are the steps that must be completed before its June 13 release.
 
Editing
Film editors make a "rough cut" for the sound and visual effects specialists while editors continue to work on the final cut.
 
Visual Effects
While filming is going on, artists build computer models of elements, such as the ship. These visual effects must later be integrated into the film.
 
Sound
New sound effects, dialogue and music enhance or replace the sound recorded during filming. These sounds are blended to fit the action.
 
Processing
The original negative is spliced. Dust and scratches are removed, color is corrected and the sound track is attached to the film before thousands of prints are made to be rushed to theaters. (Sources: Glenn Salloum, associate producer of "Speed 2"; 20th Century Fox [movie stills])

HEADLINE: Lobstermen See Threat in Whale Protection Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

 BODY:
Federal fishing authorities have thrown Maine's lobster industry into an uproar by proposing costly changes in lobster traps to insure that whales can easily escape if they become entangled in the ropes.
During a week of hearings in Maine ending on Friday, indignant lobstermen packed the halls to protest the proposed rules, which are intended especially to protect right whales, the most endangered of all the world's large whales. 
 The angry fishermen in one Portland high school auditorium alone easily outnumbered all the right whales found in the North Atlantic, where fewer than 300 of the great mammals survive.
Most of those right whales bear rope scars telling of narrow escapes from fishing gear, scientists at the National Marine Fisheries Service say, and every few years a right whale dies in the Atlantic Ocean after becoming entangled with lobster pots or gillnets.
As rare as these accidents are -- and they are almost unheard of along the coast of Maine -- when combined with the number of whales injured by ship propellers or by other causes, they are enough to threaten the species' survival. So last month, the agency said the Federal law protecting marine mammals gave it no option but to change the way the lobster industry operated.
But the industry, supported by many scientists and by state officials, argues that the proposal, which calls for the fishermen to use breakaway lines that would come undone when an entangled whale tugged forcefully on the ropes, is unworkable and too expensive. Lobster traps would have to be attached to buoys with sinking lines that would break under 150 pounds of pressure.
"Basically, it is overkill," said Dan Fernald, a seventh-generation islander from Somesville who runs about 400 lobster traps.
"When I vote, I usually vote Green Party," he said. "I am very environmentally conscious, as a lot of fishermen are. But it is not the fishermen who are hurting the right whale."
Like other lobstermen, Mr. Fernald, who said he had never seen a right whale, said that the sinking lines would chafe and snag on underwater rocks and break under the ordinary stresses of waves and wind in the violent waters off Maine. The modifications and the loss of gear would cost thousands of dollars and would put many independent fishermen out of business, they say.
And they seethe at the agency's own admission that it is "difficult or impossible to demonstrate conclusively" that the modifications would solve the whales' problem.
"In most parts of Maine," said Robin Alden, Maine's commissioner of marine resources, "it simply would not be possible to go lobster fishing using the gear required by the rule."
The fishery agency estimated the cost of the changes at $12,000 a boat. The state estimated that the whole industry would end up spending $40 million to $70 million.
Maine's two Senators are demanding that the agency overturn the rules and are threatening to rewrite the Marine Mammal Protection Act if that is what is needed.
"I am completely astounded by and extremely disappointed in the agency's efforts to date," said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, chairwoman of the Senate subcommittee that supervises fisheries. "This rule fails on nearly every major count by which a reasonable person would measure the actions of a Federal regulatory agency."
The widely held view in Maine is that few right whales are ever at risk in waters near the state's rocky shoreline, where its lobster boats work. None of the areas designated by the Federal fisheries agency as critical habitat for the species is in Maine's waters. Although large whales pass through the Gulf of Maine and, at times, through the state's waters, only about 30 of the 10,000 sightings of the whale were in waters within three miles of Maine's shoreline, plus 60 more seen 3 to 12 miles from shore.
Restrictions have also been imposed on lobstering off Massachusetts, but the debate over them has been much more intense in Maine, where the lobster is far more important to the state's economy. Maine's lobstermen argue that it is one thing to restrict operations in the whale's critical habitat areas off Massachusetts, but quite another to impose changes in Maine's waters, where the whales transit more briefly.
"Relatively speaking, the incidence of right whales is low in Maine state waters and the near-shore Gulf of Maine, where more than 90 percent of the lobster gear is fished," Ms. Alden said.
But Nancy Foster, deputy assistant administrator of the fisheries service, said that the agency had no choice under the law but to take action that would cut injuries and deaths among right whales to a third of current levels within six months.
That meant one of two things, she said: modifying the gear or prohibiting it from certain waters.
"Inaction is not an option, nor can we take action in some places where these whales occur but not in others," she said. Her testimony drew jeers from the crowd in Portland.
Jennifer Atkinson, a staff lawyer for the Conservation Law Foundation, a New England environmental advocacy group, said it was important to bring the lobstermen into the effort to conserve right whales.
"They can act as the 'eyes and ears' for the whales at sea," she said, and they must be kept at the bargaining table as an effective conservation plan for the whales is devised.
But the opportunity for reasoned discussion, she warned, "has been all but lost in the scramble to create a solid wall of state opposition to this proposed Federal action."
Bob Bowman, a whale expert who is a research associate at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, agreed with the agency that modifying fishing gear and methods was the best solution in the long run. But he agreed with the lobstermen that it made little sense to rush changes into effect without tests proving that they were effective and practical.
Mr. Bowman is the only person in Maine with the necessary Federal authorization to disentangle a whale in distress. It is a tricky process, dangerous for man and whale alike, but he said that if it was done correctly, the animal usually survived and the gear was recovered.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Mexico Wrangle: Closeness Breeds Friction

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 4

 BODY:
A labor leader unintentionally insulted President Ernesto Zedillo during May Day ceremonies here, showing something about how rocky relations are between the United States and its southern neighbor.
Whistles and catcalls forced Victor Flores, the head of Mexico's main labor congress, to cut short his speech to an auditorium filled with workers after he accidentally addressed Mr. Zedillo as "the President of the United States." 
 Even though it was an obvious slip, Mr. Flores's remark rankled the workers because to them it suggested some American encroachment on Mexico's sovereignty and identity. His gaffe was especially conspicuous because President Clinton is to arrive here on Monday for his first visit to Latin America since he took office, a visit regarded by Mexicans as long overdue.
The episode reflected how vulnerable Mexicans continue to feel to United States power and how deeply they distrust Washington's intentions.
Recent events have shown that even when the two Governments want to get along, turbulence is the normal state of relations. The peculiar logic of the marriage of geography and convenience between the United States and Mexico seems to be that the closer the relationship gets, the more tensions arise.
In many ways, ties across the 2,000-mile border have never been stronger. Presidents Clinton and Zedillo like each other. They are both relatively young leaders who studied at Yale University, both aspiring reformers whose ideas have been sharply tempered by political realities at home.
Through sessions of a commission set up in 1981, Cabinet members from the two countries meet regularly to jaw over disputes. For a commission meeting on Monday, eight Cabinet secretaries from Washington will come to Mexico along with President Clinton.
In addition, the Clinton Administration has gone much further than recent American Governments in heaping praise on Mexico's President and his Government.
In comments last week, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin pointed to "the quite remarkable political courage and resolve of the Mexican leadership." Barry McCaffrey, the retired general who heads the Administration's anti-drug efforts, spoke of "unprecedented cooperation" on narcotics issues.
Mr. Zedillo has responded in kind, recently calling Mr. Clinton "the American President who has shown the most respect for Mexico."
Despite the friendliness, relations between the countries are more tense and abrasive than they have been in at least a decade.
There are sharp divisions over the war against increasingly powerful Mexican drug cartels and the presence of an estimated two million illegal immigrants from Mexico in the United States.
Although the North American Free Trade Agreement has increased cross-border trade to record levels, sticky disputes have arisen about trucking, several agricultural products and the move by the United States to punish some Mexican companies doing business in Cuba.
Anti-Washington feeling surged here after the bitter debate in the United States Congress this spring over whether to recertify Mexico as an ally in the drug war, and because of a new American law to curb illegal immigration. Anti-Mexican feeling in the United States is growing in parts of the Southwest and California.
The inequality between the world's most powerful nation and Mexico, which is struggling out of an economic depression in the midst of a disorderly transition to democracy, makes for chronic differences of view.
"The tighter the connection between the two societies, the greater the friction," said Peter H. Smith, director of Latin American studies at the University of California at San Diego.
Part of the problem, Mr. Smith said, is that "the issues that continue to bedevil the relationship, like drugs and immigration, are not ones that can be resolved easily by cooperation between the two Governments."
"They respond to the classic incentives of supply and demand and resist Government action," he said.
Mexicans complain that despite their country's strategic importance for the United States, Washington's policies are increasingly determined by the vagaries of domestic politics on drugs, immigration and trade.
"America's ignorance and disdain for learning the ways and customs of its neighbor seems to be endless," said Jorge Montano, who served for two and a half years as Mexico's Ambassador in Washington. "The way they deal with us is by turning us into one more item on the domestic agenda."
At the same time, many Mexicans are intensely ambivalent about the United States. The mixed feelings were abundant one holiday afternoon last week at a bustling McDonald's restaurant in a middle-class neighborhood where scores of families took their children for a distinctly American-style lunch.
"It is not easy for us to be the weak ones," said Maria Guadalupe Ramirez Ornelas, a high school teacher. "We become Americanized. We bring our children to eat American fast food. But underneath, there is a lot of rancor."
Francisco Olivares, 23, an accountant, said: "Mexicans in general are always going to have doubts about the United States. We don't know whether the Americans' intentions toward us are really healthy."
Opinion surveys conducted from June 1996 to May 1 of this year among city-dwelling Mexicans by the United States Information Agency reflect the conflicted views. About half those polled have a high opinion of the United States and about half have a poor one.
According to the polls, about two-thirds of Mexicans think relations are good. But only 38 percent think the United States treats Mexico more fairly than it did five years ago. Seven in 10 Mexicans approved of United States efforts to help Mexico fight drug trafficking and solve economic problems. But 6 in 10 said the United States wielded too much influence in Mexican affairs and expected Mexico to bow to United States wishes.
Mexicans are largely enthusiastic about President Clinton, giving him a 69 percent favorable rating in a May 1 poll.
However, the customers at McDonald's were concerned that President Zedillo had not been an especially forceful President, and they worried that he might yield to pressures from Mr. Clinton.
For Mexicans, one of Mr. Clinton's most signficant meetings will be the 15-minute sessions scheduled for Tuesday with leaders of the two major opposition parties. It will be first such meetings for an American President.
But Foreign Minister Angel Gurria said the major impact of the visit would come from the mood and body language, "the image and feeling President Clinton will take away about what Mexico can represent for the United States and vice versa."
"Just the fact that the President of the United States is visiting Mexico already makes the visit a success," Mr. Gurria said.

HEADLINE: Glick Joins Borough Race In Manhattan As 5th Entry

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
In an atmosphere similar to an old-fashioned political rally, Deborah J. Glick, an Assemblywoman from Greenwich Village, yesterday became the fifth candidate to officially enter the Democratic primary for Manhattan borough president.
Ms. Glick is widely considered to be one of two leading contenders in the Democratic primary, along with City Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, of central Harlem and the Upper West Side. The incumbent Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, is running for mayor. 
 The others seeking to succeed Ms. Messinger include two members of the City Council -- Adam Clayton Powell 4th of East Harlem and Antonio Pagan of the Lower East Side -- and George N. Spitz, a retired state auditor with a reputation as a political gadfly.
While her rivals announced their candidacies on the steps of City Hall, Ms. Glick stood on a stage in the ballroom of the Sheraton New York Hotel, surrounded by a dozen politicians and facing more than 150 cheering supporters holding placards with the Assemblywoman's name emblazoned in aqua letters.
"As borough president, I will lead and advocate for the diverse interests of Manhattan communities," said Ms. Glick, 46, the first open lesbian to win election to the Assembly. She said that she would "work to unite people and neighborhoods behind a common agenda: making Manhattan a better place to live and making city government more responsive to our needs."
The Democratic primary, which is tantamount to election in Manhattan, has already become a crowded, contentious affair with the candidates seeking to portray themselves as capable of winning broad-based support.
Ms. Glick's opponents have taken pains to cast her as a one-issue candidate, suggesting that she is most responsive to issues concerning gay New Yorkers.
At yesterday's announcement, Ms. Glick was clearly attempting to distance herself from that image, with speaker after speaker on the platform praising her record on economic development, mass transit and environmental protection issues.
In her remarks, she cast herself as a champion of Manhattan neighborhoods and residents, rather than developers.
"The people of this borough deserve someone in public office who is on their side," she said. "Someone who has stood up to developers who've gone too far by trying to take another piece of our sky and another stretch of our riverfront."
Ms. Glick, having amassed nearly $500,000 in contributions so far, has raised more money than any of her opponents, and her political consultant, Hank Morris, said her campaign would likely raise the $1 million limit under the campaign-finance laws.
How Ms. Glick will do in Manhattan's racial and ethnic political calculus remains to be seen. Ms. Glick, who is white, is expected to do well among liberal white voters as well as gay Manhattanites. Ms. Fields, who is black, is expected to do well among black voters and is campaigning heavily for liberal white votes.
Mr. Powell, whose mother is Puerto Rican and whose father was a black political icon, is expected to draw some support from black voters but more heavily from Hispanics. But he is generally expected to share that Hispanic support with Mr. Pagan, who is Puerto Rican and gay.
Last week, Ms. Fields's campaign received two high-profile endorsements, from former Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Yesterday, Ms. Glick brought out her own political guns with speeches by Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, the first Puerto Rican woman elected to Congress, and Representative Jerrold L. Nadler.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
To Win Half the Time Has Become a Noble Goal

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
Major League Baseball, making a parody of parity, saw 11 of its 28 teams, including the Mets and the Yankees, enter play yesterday residing in the vicinity of .500.
In baseball, .500 for a team is roughly the equivalent of a batter hitting .250, and in either instance it's certainly nothing to get excited about. Yet for too many teams, it's really all that is left. And because inflation is what it is, and because the expanded playoffs are what they are, .500 is now viewed by far too many clubs as the doorway not only to respectability, but also to contention, as something to shout about and applaud. 
 The heretofore anonymous Pittsburgh Pirates are being praised these days because of their 15-14 record. A pulse was detected in Flushing on Saturday night when the Mets climbed to 14-15 and stirred the slumbering interest of the die-hard fans still left to them.
The Yankees? They could only hope their perch at 16-14 after yesterday's victory will keep George Steinbrenner's harsh glare off them and on poor Concerto, his Kentucky Derby loser, for just a little longer.
Sadly, for baseball purists, low rungs in the standings don't necessarily bury teams anymore. Just ask the Chicago White Sox. Losers of 18 of their first 27, the Sox were just five games out of first place when they awoke yesterday morning. The Chicago Cubs, losers of 21 of 28, were within eight and a half games of first place.
If the Pirates keep it up, they can end up leading the National League Central. As it is, the Central divisions in both leagues combined had just 2 teams out of 10 above .500 at the conclusion of play yesterday. Alas, this is not 1973, when having teams make the post-season while barely clinging to a winning record -- as the 82-79 Mets did -- raised eyebrows. These days, all .500 does is raise hopes. Mainly false hopes.
Such is the plight of the Mets, a team trying not to founder in the wake of the Atlanta Braves, the one franchise above all others that will simply not allow room for mediocrity in its division.
The Mets, no fools, don't talk in terms of catching the Braves. Nor do they walk any longer with the kind of wild-card swagger that embarrassed them two years ago. Rather, the Mets talk of taking baby steps, of reaching .500 because, outfielder Carl Everett said: "From where we've been, that's a start. You can't go farther if you haven't been there yet."
The Mets haven't been there at this late date in a season since 1994. Yesterday, they tried to write history, having climbed within a game of .500 thanks to 8 victories in their previous 11 games. But, alas, the club that has gallantly, and rather surprisingly, come back from a 3-9 start to the season despite all sorts of medical calamities, could not reach that level.
Instead, the Mets lost, returning to early season form in an 8-2 defeat at the hands of Todd Stottlemyre and the St. Louis Cardinals at Shea Stadium. And with one loss, one could almost feel the weight falling back onto the Mets' shoulders.
"Being one game under, I wanted to throw six or seven good innings, but unfortunately that didn't happen," said Mark Clark, the Mets' starter, who ultimately pitched four poor ones (eight hits, six runs) before a line drive off his pitching hand forced him from the game.
Manager Bobby Valentine didn't fret over missing the brass ring. "Five hundred is not a goal right now," he said. "We're just trying to play good baseball. I like what we've been doing. I hope we can keep on doing it."
The Mets had just won two from the Cardinals, snapping St. Louis's five-game winning streak. They have pulled together a respectable starting staff despite the continued loss of Pete Harnisch, Jason Isringhausen, Bill Pulsipher and Paul Wilson. They have managed to resuscitate Carlos Baerga's bat and, thus far, have survived the first disabling injury of Lance Johnson's career.
Yet the victory the Mets needed to prove something to someone, anyone, proved elusive. And the kind of Bronx cheers that have relocated to Flushing remain close to the surface, as a reminder that there are still questions for this team. Indeed, "Ordonez, you stink!" and "Everett, you bum!" could be heard yesterday as the leather lungs among the crowd of 17,652 got louder as a bad day got worse and worse.
Because yesterday deteriorated so completely, the Mets woke to a harsher reality today, knowing that their pursuit of respectability must now hit the road, where they play 16 of their next 22 games. That hunt begins tonight in Colorado, where the Rockies -- one of the elites -- wait.
"We want to get to .500, but it's not a .500 thing -- we know we're better than .500," said Todd Hundley, reflecting the confounded nature of such a chase.
"We're going to get there," said Butch Huskey, trying to make a wistful statement sound like a promise. "We really needed the win. It would have been big. But it's not the end of the world."
Just the end of the dream, for now. The only dream teams like the Mets get to entertain these days.

HEADLINE: Beckoned by Promise, Felled by a Short Cut;
Plight of Four Polish Immigrants Comes to Light After a Fatal Fire

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
Jan Kamieniec moved into the house in Maspeth, Queens, because the price was right: $250 a month for a room and kitchen privileges in someone else's third-floor apartment.
He could have afforded something better and safer, his friends and sister said. His hourly wage making stone counter tops had risen in recent years to more than $10 from $6.50. 
 But Mr. Kamieniec, 43, was supporting an 80-year-old mother he had left behind in Poland in 1991 and was trying to save for the future. The bargain rent helped.
Janusz Kosmowski, 39, paid even less, but all he got was a space in the cellar.
Neighbors disagreed about whether he stayed there occasionally or regularly, for nothing or for a token pittance. But they concurred that he had hit tough times, and that the balm of alcohol was making them tougher still.
"I can't figure out how it happened," his wife, Jadwiga, said after the fire, in an interview in her apartment in Pisz, Poland, where a faux Persian carpet on the living room floor and terra cotta tiles in the bathroom were measures of how much money Mr. Kosmowski had sent home during a decade in America. "I thought everything was all right."
Mr. Kamieniec, whose fortunes seemed to be rising, and Mr. Kosmowski, whose luck was ebbing, were among four Polish immigrants killed two weeks ago when flames engulfed 60-01 56th Road in Maspeth.
Both were living on the cheap in a house that had been sliced and diced to accommodate more tenants. The fire drew attention not only to such illegal conversions throughout Queens, but also to the immigrants who rely on these makeshift, dangerous accommodations.
The stories of the dead men, and of scores of Polish immigrants like them in Maspeth, are varied. They are dreamers tripping on obstacles they cannot control and drifters hitting snags of their own making. They are ascetics essentially volunteering for deprivation so that far-away relatives can know glimmers of luxury, and they are vagrants with no other choice.
They are, in other words, like millions of immigrants before them and millions since, beckoned by a promise that turned out to be more complicated than they had imagined.
A problem almost all of them face is finding inexpensive shelter. Basic one-bedroom apartments cost $700 to $800 a month, and the landlords of those legal units do not want to rent to groups of single men who plan to share the space. So the men burrow into illicit corners and cubicles.
"It's either that or living in the park," Teresa Vavak Sanchez, a Polish-American social worker in Maspeth, said. "A lot of the guys, what happens to them is they break down emotionally and start drinking. Then their lives really go to ruins."
Mr. Kamieniec, Mr. Kosmowski and Frank Glowacki -- who owned the house and was socializing with Mr. Kosmowski in the cellar when the fire started around 9:20 P.M. on April 20th -- were all drunk when they died, according to autopsy results.
Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the New York City Medical Examiner, said he could not release specific blood alcohol levels, but described the three men as "far beyond what would be considered impaired for the purposes of driving a car."
The fourth victim, Kazimierz Cielas, 41, who shared the cellar with Mr. Kosmowski and also died there, was sober, his autopsy showed.
But Mr. Cielas's acquaintances said that he, along with Mr. Kosmowski, drank frequently, a fact these acquaintances characterized as a cause, or perhaps consequence, of the men's diminished fortunes in recent years.
Like Mr. Kosmowski, Mr. Cielas had come from Pisz, also in 1986, and he, too, had left behind a wife. He told her he would be back as soon as he had earned enough for a car, according to his mother, Anna.
But months turned to years and years to a decade, and her son did not return, Mrs. Cielas said. She, like Mrs. Kosmowski, expressed ignorance of just how badly he was living in Maspeth.
"Oh, God, how could I imagine it: all those people living in a black hole in the basement?" Mrs. Cielas said in her apartment in Pisz.
Mr. Glowacki, 44, was an immigrant of much longer standing. He lived with his wife, Barbara, and two children, ages 13 and 9, in Port Chester, a suburb in Westchester County.
Barbara Glowacki said that he had come to America in 1971 and, over the years, had owned and operated Polish delicatessens in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. When he bought one at 60-01 56th Road in Maspeth in 1984, Mrs. Glowacki said, it came with two stories of housing above it. She said she knew little about her husband's dealings as a landlord.
According to city records, there should have been only two apartments, one on each of the upper floors. But former residents of the building, which was demolished after the fire, said that the third floor had been illegally split into a two-bedroom apartment with a rent of $650 a month and a one-bedroom apartment with a rent of $550. Mr. Kamieniec subleased a room from a Polish couple in the larger apartment.
Mr. Glowacki never registered the building as the de facto multiple dwelling it had become, which would have required him to install a fire escape. When flames swept up the staircase, tenants had to fling themselves and their children out of windows. Mr. Kamieniec, who was on the third floor, did not escape.
In the cellar, where the other men died, partitions had been illegally erected and a common kitchen and bathroom had been illegally installed, city officials said. Here, too, there was only one way out, and it, too, was blocked by fire.
But if the men who perished in Mr. Glowacki's house were not, as a group, completely unwitting victims, Mr. Glowacki was not a simply portrayed villain. Neighbors said that he provided cheap -- and sometimes free -- housing to people with no other options.
"None of us are perfect," Mrs. Glowacki said in her Port Chester home last week. "We all have good and bad sides of us. We all have faults. But Frank was a good person. He was a gentleman."
He was also not the only landlord in Maspeth whose property had been illegally converted. Across the street and less than 100 yards from his house stands a three-story brick building, at No. 60-30, that is infamous in the neighborhood because of the combination garage and pigeon coop behind it. This two-story shanty has been carved into a dreary warren of five rooms, many without windows, with a squalid common kitchen.
Neighborhood residents said that men pay between $100 and $250 a month to stay there, although its owner, a Polish immigrant named Charles Mardula, said through a translator last week that the men lived there free and were all his cousins.
A visit to the structure last week found just one man, Jan Karpinski, 60, who said that three others had scattered when city inspectors descended on the neighborhood after the fatal fire. Mr. Karpinski was packing his belongings.
Speaking through a translator, he said that while the other men paid rent to Mr. Mardula, he did not, because he was helping Mr. Mardula renovate another building two blocks away. He said he knew Mr. Mardula from Mt. Zion Cemetery, where they both made headstones and dug graves.
"He's a hero," Mr. Karpinski said of Mr. Mardula. "He's helping us."
Although Mr. Karpinski's job at the cemetery pays $500 a week, he said it was important for him to spend as little of that as possible on rent and to send as much as $12,000 a year to his wife and 18-year-old daughter in Poland.
"I have no choice but to live like this," Mr. Karpinski said, without a trace of self-pity. "My daughter is in school. There is not much money in Poland and it's spent very, very quickly."
Mr. Karpinski left Grajewo, Poland, in 1990, as the mass migration of the 1980's petered out. Mr. Kosmowski and Mr. Cielas, by contrast, came from Pisz during the height of that emigration, when the economy in Poland was particularly bleak.
For many families, the solution to staggeringly high unemployment and abysmal wages was to send one breadwinner abroad, especially to America, where a meager salary in dollars could translate into significant buying power in Polish zloties.
In fact, one of Pisz's wealthiest neighborhoods is nicknamed "Reagan Land" because its houses were said to be built with money that Polish emigres made in America during Ronald Reagan's Presidency in the 1980's.
Mr. Kosmowski, who was 27 when he departed Pisz in 1986, had been a manager at a lumber mill and was leaving behind a wife and infant daughter. Mr. Cielas, then 30, had done odd jobs in construction. He was leaving his second wife and a 13-year-old son who lived with his first wife.
The men planned their trips separately, arriving in New York City three months apart. They found construction, carpentry and woodworking jobs, and apparently did well enough at first. Mr. Cielas sent back about $100 a month for child support. Mr. Kosmowski sent back much more -- apparently, thousands of dollars over the years.
That money helped purchase a new car for his wife and an 18-gear mountain bike for his 11-year-old daughter, Malgosia. In addition, Mrs. Kosmowski said: "I could afford to buy nicer clothes. We took vacations by the sea."
But at some point, both men's lives took a downturn. Their only recent employment, some neighbors said, was helping Mr. Glowacki smoke sausages in a shed behind the house.
Their lives here were making less sense than in the old days. Poland's economy had improved dramatically in the 1990's, and the dollar-zloty ratio was not nearly as favorable as it had been. Mrs. Kosmowski had employment of her own in Pisz as a town clerk.
But Mr. Kosmowski and Mr. Cielas stayed in Maspeth. Neighbors said it may have been a matter of stubborn pride; ironically, the less money Polish immigrants had, the less likely they were to abandon their dream.
"You don't go back empty-handed," explained a friend who declined to give his name.
Mr. Kamieniec, however, was doing better than ever.
In the rural town of Cewkowo, Poland, he had eked out an existence on a family farm. In America, his income grew steadily.
He had become so expert at polishing and carving granite and marble surfaces that on April 1, his boss at Granite Tops, a Mount Vernon, N.Y., company, had given Mr Kamieniec a big raise.
"You could tell he was really happy," Chris Sanzaro, the company's owner, said. "He was almost in tears."
Mr. Kamieniec, Mr. Cielas, Mr. Kosmowski and Mr. Glowacki were mourned in a special memorial service one week ago at Holy Cross Church on 56th Road in Maspeth. About 150 people attended, offering tearful prayers not only for the dead, but also for the living.
One beseeched Mother Mary in a Polish hymn.
"Oh Maria," he sang, "beg the Lord for plenty of mercy for your children, so the world will be better."

HEADLINE: Nothing Worth Mining Found on Bre-X Site

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, May 4

 BODY:
An independent consulting company has found no sign that there is gold worth mining at the Indonesian site discovered by Bre-X Minerals Ltd. of Canada, which had contended that it had found the gold strike of the century.
Moreover, the independent audit concluded that initial drilling results had been deliberately doctored in an elaborate scheme to make the finds appear far richer than they actually were. 
 The audit showed "trace amounts of gold," according to the report, released today in Indonesia. But there is "virtually no possibility of an economic gold deposit" at the Busang jungle site, on the island of Borneo, which a bit more than a month ago had been widely thought to contain from 70 million to 200 million ounces of gold, worth billions of dollars.
The consulting company, Strathcona Mineral Services of Toronto, had been hired by Bre-X to clear up confusion about the drilling results, after a prospective American partner for Bre-X, Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold of New Orleans, said that its preliminary tests indicated the claims of a vast gold deposit at Busang seemed false.
Strathcona concluded that the inaccurate estimates of the gold deposits had been based on "falsified data," and said that there had been "tampering with samples delivered to the labs."
"The magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values at Busang is of a scale and over a period of time and with a precision that, to our knowledge, is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world," Strathcona concluded.
The damaging report is likely to doom any chance Bre-X might have had to go forward with the project, which had made company officials millionaires without producing a single commercial ounce of gold.
Instead, the small company, based in Calgary, Alberta, is likely to be hounded by infuriated stockholders, both large and small, who have seen the value of their shares plummet since the first doubts were raised in late March about the validity of Bre-X's initial findings.
Several shareholder groups have already filed lawsuits in the United States and Canada against Bre-X. The Toronto Stock Exchange said it would halt trading in Bre-X stock when the session opens on Monday.
The chairman of Bre-X, David G. Walsh, said he was devastated by the consultant's report. "We share the shock and dismay of our shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there," Mr. Walsh said tonight.
"We are determined to gain a full understanding for the shareholders, for Bre-X's business partners and for others, of how the earlier data came to exist," he said.
Late last week, in apparent anticipation of a negative report by the consultant, Bre-X officials were talking freely about the need for large-scale bulk samples to accurately determine how much gold lies under the jungle floor at a difficult site like Busang. Bre-X had drilled 300 test holes over the course of more than two years in coming up with its initial results. Both Freeport's and Strathcona's testings were limited to a handful of holes. Bre-X is likely to try to defend itself by insisting that more thorough testing needs to be done.
Mr. Walsh had planned to release the results of the Strathcona audit before the opening of trading on Monday morning. The results were first disclosed in Indonesia today.
The scene at the Toronto Stock Exchange when Bre-X trading resumes could not be as frantic as it was a month ago when the doubts first arose about the deposit, if only because the stock has already lost more than 80 percent of its value.
On March 26, Freeport McMoran said that the seven test holes drilled near supposedly rich holes made by Bre-X had found only "insignificant amounts of gold." Within minutes after trading resumed the following day, the stock had dived to $2.50 (Canadian) a share from $15.50, with a volume of trading so great that it repeatedly knocked out the main computer at the exchange.
Freeport McMoran has repeatedly said that it would pull out of the project if it was not economically feasible to drill for the gold. Company officials reiterated that threat as recently as last Tuesday, when they held their annual meeting in New Orleans.
There was heavy trading in Bre-X on Friday as investors placed their last bets on whether there really was gold at Busang, believers buying up cheap shares and disbelievers dumping whatever they could while the stock still had some value.
The mystery surrounding Bre-X and its tenuous grip on the Busang site has puzzled even the most experienced investors, including large mutual funds and pension managers who all seemed to have bought into Mr. Walsh's dream about Busang being El Dorado.
In March, one of Bre-X's chief geologists, Michael de Guzman, plunged to his death from a helicopter en route to a meeting with Freeport-McMoran officials who were reportedly seeking answers about the discrepancies in results between their drillings and those of Bre-X.
In February, Freeport, which has had a 30-year history of mining in Indonesia, beat out competing companies to win a 15 percent share of the Busang mine.
The company agreed to spend as much as $400 million building the mining site, but conditioned its participation on satisfactory results from its own testing.

HEADLINE: Culture's 2 Personas Face Off In a Shop

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
A small bookstore fights with its landlord, which wants to maximize its profits from a valuable storefront. The bookstore says it cannot pay such high rents and will close. The landlord says sorry, we're not in the business of subsidizing poor booksellers and prepares to rent the bookstore's space to a fancy boutique instead.
It's a familiar story, although this time the property owner is not some greedy slumlord but the Whitney Museum of American Art, which owns the building that for the last 20 years has housed Books & Company, the well-stocked, immensely comfortable bookstore that has long been on Madison Avenue but has never quite been of it. 
 The two institutions have had an unusually contentious relationship for the past few years, culminating in the Whitney's decision last week not to offer a lease at a below-market rent to a group of investors who were prepared to take over the store from its founder, Jeannette Watson. As a consequence, the store has announced its intention to close on May 31.
The Whitney has been widely portrayed as a villain, squeezing out one of New York's most respected and beloved bookstores to further its own economic ambitions. That's not entirely wrong, but what is it about this moment in history that gives museums such ambitions and creates a David and Goliath story in which a cultural institution is the Goliath? The struggle between the Whitney and Books & Company is very much a tale of a cultural institution behaving like a business, and of a business behaving like a cultural institution.
The Whitney, like most museums today desperate to maintain a steady stream of income in the face of declining government and corporate support, argues that if it is to fulfill its mission of mounting exhibitions and acquiring art it needs to gain as much money as it can from the property it owns. And Books & Company, which like most independent bookstores has been reeling from the impact of large bookselling chains, says it needs the subsidy of low rent to survive.
The institutions have traded charges and countercharges. The Whitney claims that Ms. Watson, who says she has been subsidizing Books & Company with cash infusions of as much as $100,000 annually in recent years and cannot continue, does not run the store in a sufficiently businesslike fashion. (There are no computerized inventory lists at Books & Company, and since its founding the store has sold books to established writers at deep discount, bringing their loyalty but cutting sharply into the bottom line.)
Ms. Watson and her manager, Steven Varni, claim that the Whitney misled them with promises that it would join with them in partnership to keep the store open, and that the museum fails to understand the value of having one of the city's most respected bookstores right down the block.
Ms. Watson, who plans to concentrate on a publishing venture once the store is closed, says she would cooperate with any viable plan to recreate the store in a new location with the support of other investors, or even to reconstitute it as a nonprofit foundation.
Whatever happens, alas, Books & Company is surely finished in its present location, two floors in an old brownstone whose creaky floors, exposed brick walls and simple, dark-stained bookcases bespeak an unself-consciousness that is entirely at odds with almost everything else on Madison Avenue today. Books & Company's strength may have been in the intellectual depth of its stock, but its greatest appeal was always the way the place felt: It is a store designed to wallow in, not to gawk at. From Books & Company to Prada may be only five blocks, but so far as sensibility goes, it is a million miles.
And from Books & Company to the Whitney is only about 50 feet, but it feels like two million miles. It is difficult to imagine two organizations with more different world views than this bookstore and its landlord: the laid-back bookstore that was created to replicate the casual, earnest ambiance of the idyllic bookstores of old, serving bibliophiles and caring little about how many people pass through its door, and the aggressive museum that has made audience-building, fund-raising and high-fashion parties its stock in trade.
If Books & Company were a museum, it would be the Frick Collection, not the Whitney. And if the Whitney were a bookstore, it would be Barnes & Noble, not Books & Company.
Books & Company has no computers; the Whitney was one of the first museums to establish a Web page. The staff at Books & Company ordered books on the basis of intellectual appeal; the Whitney plans its exhibitions with an eye to how much attendance they will bring. While Books & Company is technically a business, it is, of course, woefully unbusinesslike, while the Whitney, nonprofit institution though it is, could not be more corporate.
Books & Company could never have survived as a conventional business. It began when Ms. Watson, whose family founded the I.B.M. Corporation, decided in 1977 to realize her dream of an Upper East Side bookshop whose feeling would be casual but whose inventory would be as deep as a university bookstore's.
She found space in one of a small group of brownstones owned by the Whitney, which leased it to her at a modest rent, in part because the slow-moving 1970's were nothing like the 80's or the 90's in the New York real-estate market, and in part because the museum assumed that sooner or later it would be tearing the buildings down anyway. Indeed, a few years after Books & Company opened, the Whitney announced a plan to build an extravagant addition by Michael Graves beside its present building.
When wide-ranging opposition to the Graves building led to its postponement and eventual cancellation, the brownstones remained. Books & Company became all the more entrenched, and at a level of rent that seemed to be farther below the market with each passing year. The Whitney was giving the store what amounted to a de facto subsidy, and one that in effect became bigger every year as the potential rent of a Madison Avenue storefront continued to grow.
At the same time, other forces began to play havoc with both the book business and the structure of museums. Independent bookselling became more and more difficult as large chains grew powerful. Museums were facing a whole set of economic and social pressures of their own, and they tried to respond to the curtailment of government support by marketing themselves more and more aggressively to younger audiences eager for entertainment. This is a trend that the Whitney has often seemed to embrace with an enthusiasm that exceeded that of many more conservative institutions.
The cultural differences between the Whitney and Books & Company come down, in a way, to the words like "entertainment" and "audience," words that the Whitney found it could live with more comfortably than Books & Company could. For two years Ms. Watson and the Whitney negotiated over a possible partnership, but the cultural differences between them were ultimately unbridgeable: in the end, the Whitney wanted a business, and Ms. Watson did not.
The misunderstandings grew deeper in recent weeks, after Ms. Watson asked the museum to let her out of her lease at the end of May, even though it was to have run to October. The museum agreed and immediately began to seek higher-paying tenants for the space. When some investors who admired Books & Company offered to support the store if the Whitney would grant them the same favorable lease terms it had once offered to Ms. Watson, the museum refused, saying the die was cast, that it had traveled too far down the road toward maximizing its financial assets to turn back now.
That was the decision that sent shock waves through the city's literary community. "Subtract Books & Company from New York and New York loses a part of its soul," wrote Paul Auster, whose comments have been posted in the store's window, along with a lament by Norman Mailer over the store's expected end and Grace Schulman's statement that to close Books & Company would be "no less atrocious than to demolish a cathedral."

HEADLINE: Unesco Award to Imprisoned Chinese Journalist Angers Beijing

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 5

 BODY:
Unesco, an agency attacked by Western nations little more than a decade ago for its involvement in efforts to regulate the world's news organizations, is now under threat of retaliation from China because of a press freedom award it presented on Saturday to an imprisoned Chinese journalist.
Unesco's resistance to demands from China that it dissociate itself from the award to the journalist, Gao Yu, is unusual in the United Nations system, where the Chinese, ever vigilant for potential criticism, have frequently had their way in censoring or altering events. 
 In 1995, during the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, China did not allow the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader, to take any part in the celebrations, including an interfaith service at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York.
This weekend Ms. Gao, 52, who was sent to jail for six years in 1994 for reporting on how Communist Party leaders controlled Government decision-making, received the first Unesco/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize intended to honor journalists whose work brought risk or punishment.
As late as last week, Chinese officials were warning Unesco's Director General, Federico Mayor of Spain, that Beijing regarded the press award as "gross interference" in Chinese affairs that would damage relations between Beijing and the organization.
Chinese diplomats say Ms. Gao is a criminal, not a journalist. Mr. Mayor rejected repeated requests from China that the award be withdrawn and went to an international conference in Bilbao, Spain, on Saturday, to make the presentation himself.
Ms. Gao was represented by the World Association of Journalists, which had nominated her. The conference was sponsored by the International Federation of Journalists.
In a statement sent to the meeting by her family, who told her of the prize during a visit with her in prison, Ms. Gao called the award a mark of recognition that should be shared with all Chinese intellectuals. She quoted from the poet Pablo Neruda, who had written: "Deny me bread, deny me light, and spring. But never your laugh, for I would surely die." Ms. Gao added, "I think I have found Neruda's laugh from this faraway international conference hall."
The Chinese are expected to raise the issue of the award to Ms. Gao at a Unesco executive board meeting beginning on May 26. Rumors are circulating in Paris, where Unesco is based, that Beijing might withdraw from the organization or cease taking part in its activities. China could also close a Unesco office in Beijing.
In Paris, a Chinese diplomat, Zhao Changxing, told journalists that the award was "illegal." Calls to the Chinese Mission in New York were not returned.
Ms. Gao, a journalist of 20 years' experience with the China News Service and then the Economics Weekly in Beijing, also published some reports abroad, including in a Hong Kong magazine, Mirror Monthly, analyzing how the Chinese Government worked.
She was arrested in October 1993, two days before she was to leave China for a year at Columbia University. She had also been detained for 14 months after the violent suppression of the protests in Beijing in 1989.
The Unesco/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize is named for a Colombian editor, Guillermo Cano Isaza, who was assassinated in Bogota in 1986 at the offices of his newspaper, El Espectador. The attack was believed to be related to the paper's campaign against drug trafficking.The recipient of the $25,000 annual award is chosen by an independent panel of journalists.

HEADLINE: Growth's Limits in Latin America

 BODY:
When President Clinton meets Central American and Caribbean leaders later this week, he will find that some basic economic assumptions have changed. A few years ago, despite warnings from many economists, politicians in Latin America and Washington assumed that economic growth alone would take care of even the poorest Latin Americans. Many people believed them. They do not anymore. Growth has been too slow, and in Latin America, which has the largest gap between rich and poor, the gains have gone mainly to the rich, buying too many cell phones and not enough rice.
Because of inequality and high population growth, there are more poor people in Latin America than ever before. Market reforms have removed many disastrous policies and bureaucratic obstacles to long-term growth and possibly long-term relief for the poor. But Latin governments are now realizing that even with market economies, they need sound social policies and stronger education and health systems to reduce poverty on a broad scale. The Inter-American Development Bank is now focusing on such programs. Mr. Clinton will mention poverty, but the issue deserves more emphasis than it will get. 
 Latin America's economies have grown 3 percent a year in this decade, a welcome contrast to the sharp decline during the debt crisis of the 1980's. But many forget that from World War II to 1980, Latin America grew 5.5 percent each year. Its swift population growth requires economic growth of at least 6 percent.
The picture is not uniformly bleak. Several countries have reduced poverty since 1990, mainly by taming inflation, which is hardest on the poor. Brazil is the most recent success. But this is a dividend that only pays out once. To sustain the decrease in poverty levels, countries would do well to copy Chile's example. Chile has not only enjoyed steady growth but has moved to attack poverty in ways the market cannot. Among its important initiatives have been reforms in the education system, including special emphasis on better elementary schooling for poor children. Bolivia has also made important reforms. Social security is now more accessible to the poor, and new banks specialize in very small loans.
Other nations have been less innovative. In general, Latin countries need to invest much more than they have in basic health and primary education, which have been slighted in favor of universities and high-tech urban hospitals that largely help the middle class. They should also focus on women and girls, who are the poorest. Many needed reforms, such as widening access to credit or land titles, cost very little.
These reforms would benefit the United States as well. Middle-class Latin Americans will be less likely to emigrate. The wealthier people become, the more they will buy American exports. The United States now exports more to Central America than it does to the whole of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Clinton will hear complaints next week from leaders who have watched with dismay as the United States shifted its trade and investment to Mexico after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The World Bank estimated that the Caribbean could see Mexico take over a third of its exports to the United States. Mr. Clinton should renew efforts in Congress to give hard-hit exports from the Caribbean the same entry to the United States that Mexico enjoys.
The United States is also $20 million in arrears to a special fund at the Inter-American Development Bank that finances anti-poverty projects in Latin America's five poorest countries. Congress should promptly pay off that shortfall.
Mr. Clinton has a lot to talk about during his journey, including migration, environmental protection and drugs. But he should make time to talk about fighting poverty. Washington played a major role in persuading Latin America to institute free-market reforms. It can now usefully promote a second wave of reforms to extend the market's benefits to the poor.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances on Report Of Unemployment in Germany

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a 38-month high against the mark yesterday and settled mostly stronger in other foreign exchange dealings on leaked Government data from Germany showing persistently weak employment.
But the dollar was slightly lower against the yen, reflecting trader reluctance to sell the Japanese currency ahead of potentially market-moving trade data to be released by Japan this week. 
 A late afternoon surge in the United States stock market also contributed to the dollar's strength.
But currency traders said the lack of volume in foreign exchange market exaggerated price movements, so they did not read much significance into the dollar's behavior. Financial markets in Tokyo and London were closed for holidays.
"There wasn't a whole lot to get your teeth around today," said Tom Hoge, vice president of corporate foreign exchange trading at the Bank of New York.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7386 marks in Asian dealings, the strongest since February 1994, before settling in New York at 1.7324 marks, up from 1.7293 Friday.
Against the yen, the dollar initially rose as high as 127.08 yen before dropping to settle in New York at 126.53 yen, down from 126.57 yen Friday. The pound rose to $1.6228 from $1.6210.
The broad strength of the dollar early in the trading day was partly an extension of its rally Friday on healthy United States employment data. Traders said news from Germany suggesting more economic anemia was a further reason to buy dollars and sell marks.
Over the weekend and yesterday, parts of the German Federal Labor Office's April unemployment report were disclosed by the local German news media, showing joblessness remained at record highs.
Although the leaked reports said the overall unemployment rate fell to 11.3 percent, from 11.7 percent in March, the data still showed 4.35 million Germans were out of work, a postwar record for the month. The official employment report is scheduled to be released today.
The dollar's decline also reflected some fear that official Japanese data to be released today would show a further widening of Japan's trade surplus with the United States.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Recover From Early Losses

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities turned mixed yesterday, erasing early losses when bonds followed stocks higher.
With little data from which to set strategy yesterday, most investors assumed defensive postures while waiting for details of the balanced-budget agreement President Clinton and Congressional leaders announced on Friday. Most simply wanted to get through this week's Government quarterly refunding quickly, because absorbing the added supply burdens the market. 
 The 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1/32 yesterday to a price of 96 28/32 to yield 6.88 percent, unchanged from Friday.
Bond prices climbed more than three and a half points last week after the Government released a spate of statistics suggesting that consumer prices were in check and that the economy might be losing steam.
The budget agreement also helped the market, because if the deficit were to shrink, the Government would have to sell fewer bonds, making existing securities scarcer and thus more expensive.
Kim Rupert, an economist for MMS International in San Francisco, said that supply was playing a role in the day's trading as the market built in concessions before this week's quarterly refunding, which starts today with the sale of $17 billion of three-year notes, followed tomorrow by the sale of $12 billion in 10-year notes. She said that the issuance of corporate debt was also expected to build this week, given the improved market conditions.
Comcast Cellular, a unit of the Comcast Corporation of Philadelphia, plans to sell $900 million of 10-year notes in a private sale through Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette; Dominion Resources, a utility holding company based in Richmond, plans the private sale of $800 million in five-year and 10-year notes through Lehman Brothers.
"I don't think supply should be a problem for the market," Ms. Rupert said, in part "because the market is in a much better mood, psychologically."
"Besides," she continued, "the budget outlook suggests that supply is going to be reduced looking forward."
At yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of $14 billion in new three-month and six-month bills, results were better than expected, with rates dropping eight basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the previous auction, for both maturities.
For a three-month bill, the average rate was 5.14 percent; the six-month issue was at 5.37 percent.
Investor demand was strong. For the three-month maturity, the bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with the number of securities available, was 8.54 to 1, better than the average 6.12 to 1 over the last four auctions. For the six-month issue the bid-to-cover ratio was 6.22 to 1, compared with the four-week average of 5.90 to 1.
Noncompetitive bids were also strong, totaling $1.52 billion for the three-month bill and $1.29 billion for the six-month issue. Both were better than their respective four-week averages of $1.42 billion and $1.14 billion.
"While the bulk of recent gains seems to be past," said David Cole, fixed-income analyst with Technical Data, "the newly regained constructive views will have traders supporting the market on brief pullbacks. That should allow Tuesday's three-year note offering to proceed without too much difficulty. Trading volume in the when-issued note has been average, suggesting that the dealer community is well prepared to absorb supply."
In when-issued trading late in the day, the three-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.41 percent; the 10-year was at 6.66 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.701	97.285	Discounted Rate	5.14%	5.37%	Coupon Yield	5.28%	5.60%	High Price	98.703	97.295	Discounted Rate	5.13%	5.35%	Coupon Yield	5.27%	5.58%	Low Price	98.701	97.285	Discounted Rate	5.14%	5.37%	Coupon Yield	5.28%	5.60%	Accepted at low price	45%	15%	Total applied for	$62,971,552	$44,176,022	Accepted	$7,041,342	$7,106,962	Noncompetitive	$1,520,948	$1,285,505

HEADLINE: Ford Sales Fell 4.3% in April as Big 3 Lost Share to Foreign Makers

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 5

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 4.3 percent last month, as the Big Three American auto makers lost ground to Japanese auto makers that benefited from favorable exchange rates.
The Big Three sold 73.3 percent of the cars and trucks purchased in the United States in April, down 2.1 percentage points from April 1996. Their loss was mostly Japanese auto makers' gain: they picked up 1.2 percentage points of market share, while German auto makers gained another seven-tenths of a percentage point. 
 With the strong dollar holding down the cost of imported cars and car parts, Japanese auto makers have been able to keep prices virtually steady since the current model year began in October. American auto makers, meanwhile, have continued raising prices. Japanese auto makers have also introduced many popular new models, particularly small sport utility vehicles like the Honda CR-V.
Wall Street analysts said those factors had been helping Japanese auto makers since then. April was "another strong month for the Japanese car companies," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
But for the auto industry as a whole, April sales were weak, particularly compared with the torrid pace of March sales. Sales last month fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.3 million, down from 15.7 million in March. Analysts and economists said that the size of the drop was misleadingly large because the Commerce Department's seasonal adjustments might have understated sales in April.
Analysts said that the sharp drop-off in the sales pace was probably a short-term one, and that they expect sales to pick up again this month unless labor problems get in the way. April was "a pothole in the expansion" of the economy, said David M. Garrity, an analyst with Smith Barney.
While the particularly weak April sales pace is unlikely to continue, it is still a harbinger of slower economic growth, economists said. "The second quarter is going to be much weaker than the first quarter," said Diane C. Swonk, an economist with First Chicago NBD Corporation.
While sales last month were partly hurt by three strikes that have left about 31,000 members of the United Automobile Workers union off the job, analysts said that the strikes would have more of an impact in May. "The worst of the strike effect is still ahead of us," said Ms. Swonk, who noted that dealers are expected to run out of the most popular models later this month.
The union is on strike at two General Motors Corporation assembly plants, one in Pontiac, Mich., and one in Oklahoma City. A strike at a Chrysler Corporation engine factory in Detroit has shut down a number of other factories nationwide.
Ford said today that its car sales fell 10.7 percent and its sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans rose six-tenths of a percent compared with the corresponding period a year ago.
Ford's giant sport utility vehicle, the Expedition, continued to prove popular, with more than 21,000 sold in April. Sales of the Ford Escort increased 8.4 percent, to 20,954. But many models posted declines.
Ford and Mercedes-Benz were the last auto makers to report their April sales. Mercedes said today that its sales rose 23.1 percent in April, to 9,229.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Famine Strains Quality of Mercy

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
One of Kwan Young Bom's brothers was killed fighting North Korea in the Korean War and another lost some fingers. But standing outside Seoul Station, where volunteers were collecting money for North Korean famine relief, Mr. Kwan explained why he had given a donation.
"When I was a child, Korea was a very poor country and we suffered together, North and South," said Mr. Kwan, 61. "We should help North Koreans more than the refugees in Africa." 
 Like a growing number of South Koreans, Mr. Kwan is willing to overlook North Korea's past to save its people from famine. But for South Korea the line between humanitarian concerns and political realities is a tough one to draw. Should South Korea feed an enemy that vows to destroy it but is also its brother?
How South Korea answers this question is likely to affect the world's response to the food shortage in the Communist North, which is said to be already claiming lives. If South Korea and other wealthy neighbors of North Korea like Japan do not give aid, it is unrealistic to expect the rest of the world to do so in a big way.
So far, South Korea has seesawed from impulsive generosity to cool stinginess and seems to have settled on aid in controlled doses. Worried about being perceived as insensitive, it is about to make another donation, probably $10 million worth of corn, through the United Nations World Food Program.
But South Korea and the United States are trying to entice North Korea into peace negotiations by offering food. Too much aid too soon could let North Korea off the hook and feed its 1.1 million-member army.
Seoul is also trying to keep private donations in check. "Last year they went out preventing people from trying to give aid," said Stephen Linton, chairman of the Eugene Bell Foundation, an American nonprofit group.
This year, he and others said, some restrictions have been lifted. But Seoul, which does not let citizens have contact with North Korea, requires that all donations be funneled through South Korea's Red Cross, which, fund-raisers complain, is slow and costly. And they say the Seoul Government is discouraging outdoor fund-raising rallies.
"Such rash moves for sentimental reasons might mislead the North," the Government's Unification Minister, Kwon O Kie, said.
The Government is also discouraging corporate contributions, fearful that South Korea's giant companies will try to outdo one another -- not out of genuine humanitarian concern but to win the inside track on doing business in the North in the future.
Political considerations have also stopped the flow of aid from Japan, which has a stockpile of surplus rice, some of it rotting from age, that is large enough to wipe out all of North Korea's food shortfall.
But Japan is not offering aid because of reports, still unconfirmed, that North Korea kidnapped Japanese citizens, including a 13-year-old girl who vanished 20 years ago.
The World Food Program of the United Nations has raised only $34 million of the $95 million in food aid it is seeking for North Korea. "Time is running out," a spokeswoman said.
Catherine Bertini, executive director of the World Food Program, said that on a recent visit to North Korea she saw few children with distended bellies, a sign of starvation. But many children were lethargic and stunted in growth. "Children who we thought were 2 years old were actually 4," she wrote in the Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper.
The famine is a result of two years of flooding that devastated farmland in North Korea, and of the nation's economic collapse. One reason the floods were so damaging is that North Korea cleared trees from mountains to get firewood and to make space for crops.
Most agree that the biggest reason for the dearth of aid is North Korea's belligerence. When South Korea shipped 150,000 tons of rice in 1995, North Korea never said thank you. Instead, it insisted that the South Korean ship hoist the North Korean flag and arrested a crew member as a spy for taking photographs of the harbor.
Lack of access to the secretive North means there are virtually no photographs of pitiable children to tug at donors' hearts.
It also leads to doubts that the problem is as bad as advertised. South Korean officials point out that China and Russia do not think people are dying of hunger. Officials in Seoul say North Korea might be appealing for aid to save the money it usually spends on grain imports.
Others say North Korea should help itself first before asking others. On April 15, it staged an elaborate celebration for the birthday of its "Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, unveiling a huge new statue and flying in entertainers from many countries.
"Why should they spend $100 million to $200 million to celebrate a dead man's birthday?" a senior South Korean official said.
There is also fear that food aid will be diverted to the military. Some point out that if North Korea cut 5 percent from its military budget, estimated at $5 billion or more, it could buy enough grain to alleviate the famine.
Seoul and Washington make a distinction between "humanitarian aid," meaning small-scale assistance offered through organizations like the World Food Program, and bilateral aid, in which larger amounts of food are shipped directly to North Korea.
The two Governments say the food aid will not be tied to politics. The United States has donated $25 million through the World Food Program. South Korea is expected shortly to announce a new contribution on top of $6 million offered two months ago.
But the World Food Program appeal would raise enough money to buy only 200,000 metric tons of grain, less than 10 percent of what it estimates is a 2.3 million ton shortfall in North Korea.
So the big donations will have to be directly from governments. And for that, the United States and South Korea have insisted that North Korea agree to enter negotiations aimed at forging a peace treaty to replace the fragile armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.
If the North takes part in the talks and agrees to some interim measures to reduce tensions, South Korea would provide hundreds of thousands of tons of grain, an official said.
But at recent talks in New York, North Korea balked at taking part in the talks unless it was guaranteed 1.5 million tons in advance. "The North had the wherewithal to open that gate and they just didn't," an American diplomat said.
But while the South Korean Government waits, private citizens are stepping up aid.
"You see this new fervor -- incredible," said Dr. Lee Yoon Gu of World Vision International, an aid group based in California. "The whole national sentiment is there now, despite all the political anxieties."
The South Korean Red Cross said it has collected about $3.5 million since 1995, but nearly a third of that came in April alone.
Roman Catholic and other religious groups and students have been most active. The Buddhist Sharing Movement Center hopes to get 100,000 people to agree to skip lunch every Friday and donate the money saved to famine relief. Some students at Seoul National University ate only one bowl of corn soup a day for four days to experience hunger.
One factor for the increased flow is that a few weeks ago the Government began allowing the private aid to include rice, which had been banned because it is easier than other foods to stockpile for the military. It is also letting aid groups arrange their own food purchases, though the final delivery must still be made by the Red Cross.
"If we give the money to the South Korean Red Cross it takes at least two months to deliver to the North," said Jung An Sook of the Buddhist Sharing Movement. She said the Red Cross paid five times more than it needed to because it bought flour in South Korea rather than in China.
The private aid is not likely to be enough to eliminate the need for government assistance. So if North Korea does not agree to take part in peace talks, Washington and Seoul might face a big decision: whether to let North Korean people starve to punish them for the actions of their Government, over which they have little control.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Proposes That New York Help Immigrants Become Citizens

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
In a reflection of the rising political and economic influence of immigrants in New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will call this week for the creation of a city agency to recruit and assist legal immigrants who want to become citizens.
Mr. Giuliani's aides said yesterday that the Mayor would propose spending $12 million to set up six offices around the city to help immigrants at every stage of the naturalization process, from filling out forms to preparing for citizenship tests to negotiating the complicated bureaucracy of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The money will be included in the budget plan he will make public on Thursday. 
 The Mayor said he would discuss the program in a speech on immigration policy to the American Jewish Committee in Washington on Wednesday. It is the latest in a series of speeches Mr. Giuliani has given on the topic ever since Congress passed a welfare bill last year to severely restrict benefits to immigrants living in the United States.
Mr. Giuliani warned that the cut in Federal money could be expensive to New York, because the city would be forced to make up for the lost aid. Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that New York would be spared some of those costs because of a deal reached last weekend between President Clinton and Republicans restoring some of the cuts, and that his citizenship program would save the city more money by helping as many as 60,000 immigrants in New York City become citizens by the end of 1998.
Though unusual, the city's plan is not unique. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman proposed spending $2 million to help some poor immigrants in New Jersey become citizens, and similar efforts have been started in California and Florida. But national immigration advocates said Mr. Giuliani's plan appeared to be the most ambitious effort by a local government to assist immigrants, and was particularly striking at a time when many Republicans have been associated with anti-immigration policies.
That Mr. Giuliani decided to provide money for the program, and highlight it at the start of a week that traditionally has been marked with leaks about budget proposals, is the latest indication of the extent to which immigrants have become part of the political and economic culture of New York.
It is also the latest effort by Mr. Giuliani to stake out pro-immigration policies as a central part of his political identity, distancing himself from Republican policies and appealing to the rising number of naturalized citizens who will be eligible to vote this November, when Mr. Giuliani is up for re-election. In recent months, Mr. Giuliani has lobbied Republicans in Washington, filed lawsuits against the Federal Government and formed a coalition of well-known Americans to extol the virtues of immigration.
Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigration advocacy group in Washington, said: "When he started speaking out on this, a lot of people were sort of scratching their heads and saying, 'What the hell is he doing? Is he going to become a Democrat?' I think in many respects he's emerged as one of the leading champions on immigration."
Mr. Giuliani described his efforts as "a matter of fairness."
"If people are allowed into this country legally," the Mayor said, "and they are expected to pay taxes at the same level as everyone else, they should be treated the same way as everybody else. The only way we can absolutely assure that in the future is to make them citizens."
But there is clearly a budgetary motive in the Mayor's proposal. City officials say that under the welfare law pushed through Congress by Republicans last year, at least 150,000 immigrants in New York City would have lost food stamps and disability payments. That would have forced New York City to spend $76 million to replace cash benefits for those losing disability money in the fiscal year starting July 1.
The agreement struck by Mr. Clinton and Republicans to eliminate some of those cuts, however, means that city officials are now recalculating both the cost of the Federal welfare revisions and how the new program will work. Mr. Giuliani said one effect is that his program will seek to help immigrants beyond those in danger of losing their benefits, and his aides emphasized that they viewed the office as a permanent addition to the city government.
City officials estimated that 1.2 million of the city's 7.3 million residents were legal immigrants.
The money for the program, $11.8 million, will be included in Mr. Giuliani's 1997-98 executive budget, which he will present to the City Council on Thursday.
The city would hire 100 people, who would work out of offices in the Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. City Hall officials said immigrants would be recruited by mail and at-home visits.
Mr. Giuliani's aides likened the workers to social service caseworkers. They said that in addition to helping immigrants fill out forms, the workers might refer them to lawyers or helping them be fingerprinted, among other things.
The new agency would be in the Department of Youth and Community Development.
If the office is successful, it seems certain to create new problems for the I.N.S., which already has backlogs up to 10 months in its New York City office. Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights Project of the National office of the American Civil Liberties Union, praised the New York plan, but said it demonstrated the deficiencies of Federal policy.
"It's unfortunate that the I.N.S. has made the process unnecessarily cumbersome and difficult so cities have to step in and help," he said.
Russell A. Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the I.N.S., said the agency welcomed Mr. Giuliani's plan. "The reality of the situation is we are the biggest supporters of citizenship there is," he said. "We are delighted that individuals who have not actively pursued citizenship are doing so.
"Granted, it does present a significant challenge for us."

HEADLINE: Dow Hits Another High and Small Stocks Join Surge Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market rallied across the board yesterday as the Dow Jones industrial average soared to a high and stocks of smaller companies continued a resurgence that has seen them climb almost 8 percent in a little more than a week.
The Dow jumped 143.29 points, or 2.03 percent, to 7,214.49, outstripping its former high by 129 points. The Dow has now recovered the ground it lost in the March-April selloff and much more. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, also hit a high, finishing at 830.29, up 17.32 points, or 2.13 percent. 
 But even more spectacular was the performance of small-capitalization stocks, which have sharply underperformed their bigger brothers the last year and fell far steeper in the recent selloff that pushed the Dow down 9.8 percent.
The Russell 2000 small-cap index rose 2.4 percent yesterday and is up 7.1 percent since April 24.
The stock market's rebound so quickly after the Federal Reserve set off the selloff in March by raising short-term interest rates may soon have investors wondering if the current rally represents "irrational exuberance," as the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has worried.
"This comes as somewhat of a surprise," said Byron Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "There was a lot of negative sentiment out there."
The reasons for the sharp rise were much the same as those behind the rally all last week: a surge in the economy to a 5.6 percent annual growth rate and improving corporate earnings balanced by the lack of signs of inflationary pressure and the belief that the economy was beginning to slow. This picture led investors to think that the Fed now might have to raise short-term interest rates only once more to nudge the economy down to a pace of 2.5 percent growth and keep inflation in check.
Mr. Wien said that because sentiment had been so negative, particularly because it had been feared that the Fed would raise interest rates several more times, the stock market was primed to soar on surprisingly good news. And that, he said, came when bond investors did not sell and push interest rates higher last week even after the Government said the economy grew at its fastest rate in nine years in 1997's first quarter.
Added to that impetus was the deficit-reduction agreement reached last week between Congressional Republicans and the White House. The deal promises a reduction in the capital gains tax.
Such a move should encourage investment in the long term and, in the short term, keep investors from selling until they know what the effective date of the tax cut will be.
Also adding a spark to the market at the end of the day was a report that a jury in Florida had found in favor of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings, in a tobacco liability case. The jury decided that the company had not acted negligently and had not made a dangerous, defective product that caused the death of a smoker. RJR Nabisco stock, which had been down 1 1/4, wound up rising 3 1/8, to 32 5/8. Philip Morris, one of the 30 Dow stocks, finished up 4 1/4, at 44 1/8, after being as low as 38.
Along with small-cap stocks, technology issues also did well. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 2.6 percent, or 33.91 points, to 1,339.24.
But the sectors that were lagging behind the Dow still have a way to go to catch up. The Nasdaq index is up just 3.73 percent on the year, while the Dow is up 11.88 percent. The Russell small-cap index is still down five one-hundredths of a percent for the year despite its furious rally.
Claudia Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential Securities, said there were several reasons for the rebound in small-cap stocks. One is the promise of the capital gains tax cut, which tends to favor small caps more than bigger stocks because the small caps can appreciate more, making the tax break even more attractive.
In addition, she said that the stark underperformance of small caps the last year was beginning to attract investors who believe the issues are ready for a rebound as the rally in bigger stocks appears to be becoming overextended. And she said there probably was a lot of betting on stocks in the Russell index ahead of a reformulation of the index the end of next month.
But Thomas McManus, a strategist at NatWest Securities, warned against too much euphoria over small-capitalization issues. He said that investors should beware that the current rally is coming after two disappointing quarters of earnings for these companies.

HEADLINE: Bre-X: From Rags to Riches, Back to Rags

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, May 5

 BODY:
The American and Indonesian companies that only a few months ago were fighting for the right to help Bre-X Minerals Ltd. of Canada mine in what had been touted as this century's richest gold strike walked away from the project today and left Bre-X on its own to defend what is being called one of the scams of the century.
The small rags-to-riches-to-rags company, based in Calgary, Alberta, now faces the fallout from a devastating report concluding that the Indonesian mother lode at Busang was nothing but a fabulous tale backed by false hopes and counterfeit data. 
 The finding is likely to wipe out whatever value is left in Bre-X's battered stock. It will also cast a shadow over Canadian wildcatters and miners, making it difficult for small companies to build the trust needed to raise capital for future projects.
"I've never seen a fraud on this scale," said James R. Moffett, chairman of Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold of New Orleans. That company, Bre-X's former partner, officially withdrew today. At the same time, Mohamad (Bob) Hasan, an Indonesian businessman and confidant to President Suharto, announced that he, too, was pulling out of the Busang project.
"The good guys will go on while the bad guys fall by the wayside," Mr. Hasan said in Jakarta. "Life goes on."
Strathcona Mineral Services of Toronto, an independent consultant, had been hired by Bre-X in March to clear up doubts about the company's estimate that the Busang discovery contained 70 million to 200 million ounces of gold, worth $70 billion.
Instead, Strathcona concluded that "there is virtually no possibility of an economic gold deposit" on Bre-X's Busang site in Borneo. Furthermore, Strathcona confirmed the suspicion of many experts that drilling samples had been tampered with to inflate gold estimates. The report was released early today in Jakarta, late Sunday evening in New York.
The falsification of samples was done "on a scale and over a period of time and with a precision that to our knowledge is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world," the Strathcona report said.
"The gold recovered in samples submitted by Bre-X has originated from a source other than the southeastern zone of the Busang property," it concluded.
"The report didn't say salted but that's just a nice way for them to avoid a lawsuit," said Sam Romberger, a professor of geology at the Colorado School of Mines. Salting is the mining-industry phrase for lacing drilling samples with particles of gold from a source other than where the drilling had taken place.
Professor Romberger said it appeared to have been a not very sophisticated attempt at fraud, in part because the gold used to salt the samples had characteristics clearly showing it came from someplace else.
One important question not addressed by Strathcona is specifically who is responsible for the actions that took in thousands of big and small investors.
To the groups of shareholders who have already filed several class-action suits against Bre-X, the answer seemed clear. "We've been pleading conspiracy to defraud all along," said Harvey T. Strosberg, a lawyer from Windsor, Ontario, representing about 100 Canadian investors.
Suspicion is also being directed at one of Bre-X's chief geologists, Michael T. de Guzman, who worked most closely in gathering the hundreds of core samples on which Bre-X's rosy estimates were based. However, Mr. de Guzman died in a mysterious fall from a helicopter in March. Local police authorities said notes found in the helicopter indicate that Mr. de Guzman committed suicide because he was suffering from hepatitis B, something his family says it doubts.
Larry Waite, director of enforcement at the Ontario Securities Commission said, "The new developments are obviously of interest to many regulatory authorities, including us." And the commercial crime unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is studying the Strathcona report to determine if a criminal investigation is warranted.
In Indonesia, the Minister of Mines and Energy, Ida Bagus Sudjana, told reporters that the Government would take legal action against Bre-X. "Every law breaker must be punished," he said.
While the accusations are being sorted out, trading in Bre-X shares have been suspended on every exchange where they are listed, including the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Trading will resume Tuesday.
After Freeport raised doubts in March about the validity of Bre-X's glowing forecasts and the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. de Guzman, the company's stock plummeted.
It once traded for more than $20 a share in both Canadian and American dollars after a 10-for-1 stock split. Before the Freeport report, it was valued at $15.50 on the Toronto exchange and $11.375 on Nasdaq. Last Friday, the stock dropped to $3.23 in Toronto and $2.375 on Nasdaq.
The company's chairman and chief promoter, David G. Walsh, was in Calgary today expressing shock and disappointment at the findings and promising to get down to the bottom of the mystery. His chief of exploration, John B. Felderhof, was at his beachside home in the Cayman Islands insisting that neither he nor anyone on his staff had been involved in fraud.
"I personally still believe that there are significant amounts of gold at Busang," he said in a statement faxed from the Cayman Islands.
Mr. Walsh and Mr. Felderhof became millionaires as the gold fever pushed up the price of the Bre-X shares. They managed to keep tenuous control of the Busang property in spite of stiff competition from larger companies. They also survived the political intrigue that accompanies doing business in Indonesia.
Investors who bought into Bre-X early and sold before the problems emerged in March made millions of dollars, even though the company never turned a profit. However, stockholders who held their shares until Bre-X's drilling estimates were questioned lost more than $3 billion in total.
"I guess I should have sold it all but I was a bit dumb," said Aksel Gustavsen, 79, a retired farmer now living in Calgary, who has been on the Bre-X roller coaster. He said that in the good times he made about $150,000 buying and selling the company's stock. When Bre-X crashed in March, the value of his remaining shares lost about $10,000 of their value in a few minutes.
"A lot of people have lost their bread-and-butter money," Mr. Gustavsen said. "This shouldn't happen in the land of Canada."

HEADLINE: U.S. READIES RULES OVER PREFERENCES AIDING MINORITIES

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will announce a new approach in the awarding of Government contracts that may suspend race-based preferences for some minority-owned businesses while making available billions of dollars in Federal contracts for others, officials said today.
The new effort reflects a commitment within the Administration to preserve some affirmative action programs while complying with court rulings that severely limit them. 
 The revised approach, in proposed Justice Department regulations to be issued later this week, will substantially change the rules for awarding Federal contracts worth $200 billion a year.
It will rely heavily on an ambitious industry-by-industry review, already under way at the Commerce Department, that is intended to determine where minority groups may actually be experiencing discrimination in the awarding of Government contracts.
While some minority-owned businesses may well benefit from the findings, the review may also determine that minority groups are over-represented in some areas of Government contracting. In those cases, officials said, preferences will be scaled back, suspended or eliminated.
Specific winners and losers under the plan will not be known until later this year, when the review is complete.
The proposal is a response to a 1995 Supreme Court decision, Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena, which drastically limited the ability of Federal programs to award benefits on the basis of race or sex. The case involved a white-owned Colorado company that lost a Federal highway guard-rail construction job to a Hispanic-owned business that had submitted a higher bid.
In a 5-to-4 vote on that case, the Supreme Court ruled that race-based preference programs were constitutional only in response to quantifiable evidence of discrimination against an affected party. There is no across-the-board entitlement, among all members of a minority group, to Government preference based solely on historic discrimination, the Justices said.
The Administration has been struggling for the last two years to find a way to comply with that decision while preserving affirmative action programs that are strongly supported by important Democratic constituencies: blacks and other minorities, as well as women.
Businesses that are owned by minorities, or that for other reasons qualify as economically disadvantaged, now account for 6.6 percent, or $11 billion, of annual Federal procurement of goods and services, from paper products to engineering studies.
President Clinton, in a 1995 speech that followed an intensive internal Administration review, vowed to "mend" affirmative action but not "end" it. He promised to establish legal measures to help disadvantaged businesses to compete fairly with more established companies without imposing "reverse discrimination" on white-owned concerns.
Administration officials, who insisted on anonymity because the new proposed regulations have not yet been published, said the rules were an effort to find a "narrowly tailored fix" that could pass the Supreme Court's rigid standard while meeting the President's goal of keeping some preferences intact.
"These programs are in legal jeopardy," a senior official said of minority set-asides and other race-based preference programs. "We see this as a way to do affirmative action right and break down some of the discriminatory barriers. The whole effort is to use affirmative action where it's warranted."
In an effort to meet the requirements that the Supreme Court laid out in the Adarand case, the Administration has undertaken the vast review of industry statistics, census data and Federal procurement spending to determine where minorities have suffered apparent bias.
The Government is looking at 80 industries that account for the bulk of Federal procurement to determine where there are discrepancies between "capacity" (the number and size of qualified minority businesses) and "utilization" (the dollar value of Government contracts that those business win).
The Administration will use significant disparities between the two as evidence of discrimination. In those cases, Government agencies will be permitted to give minority businesses, or contractors that employ minority subcontractors, a bidding bonus or other form of credit.
Under the new rules, the maximum bonus for a minority business would be 10 percent, meaning that the company's bid would be reduced by as much as 10 percent in the determination as to which bidder gets a particular contract.
The industry-by-industry review will not be completed until October, when the new rules, after a period for public comment, are scheduled to take effect.
Richard L. Hayes, a Labor Department official on loan to the White House to oversee writing of the affirmative action guidelines, said there was no way to predict which minority businesses would benefit and which might suffer until the review was finished.
"It's still a big mystery what the impact will be," Mr. Hayes said. "We think these rules will meet the test of the Court, we think we have fixed the programs, and we think we have a system that is constitutionally defensible. Now the test is to implement the system, and that's our goal."
Christopher Edley Jr., a civil rights specialist at Harvard Law School, said he hoped minorities would benefit from the review by qualifying for additional help in winning Federal contracts.
But Mr. Edley, a former senior White House aide who directed the review of affirmative action programs during Mr. Clinton's first term, said the Administration was committed to "let the chips fall where they may" if statistical studies now under way did not prove discrimination.
"This new system will allow us to use tools to remedy discrimination when it is present but to turn off preference programs when sufficient progress has been made," Mr. Edley said.
He added, however, that he expected the review to demonstrate conclusively that minorities were markedly under-represented in many sectors of Government contracting.
"One of the benefits of this exercise is that it will help force attention into those areas where progress has been little or nil," Mr. Edley said. "And that's all to the good."

Software on Queens

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The Queens Economic Development Networking Council has developed a computer program that will offer detailed information on all of Queens's 58,000 businesses: what they are, their location, number of employees, annual sales, and where their competitors and suppliers are.
The program, which will be available free at the borough president's office and the Jamaica Business Resource Center, was financed by Chase Manhattan Bank. It will rely on a mapping program created by Database America, a Montvale, N.J., company. 
 "We want to give businesses another resource," said Steven Lewandowski, executive director of the networking council. "This is the first initiative in any of the boroughs doing a demographic overlay of all of their businesses."
The networking council was created in January 1996 to identify businesses in the borough that were considering leaving or closing, to try to persuade them to stay.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
WHEN Mike Higgins, 61, sold his wine shop in Oakland, Calif., last year, he retired to Oregon, an easygoing, sparsely populated state, where personal freedom is still highly valued and everyone works hard not to step on anyone else's toes.
Or so he thought. 
 "I love it here," he said of the little town of Jacksonville, where he chose to settle, "although I especially miss my old wine-tasting friends and the customers at my shop, Vino!"
To keep alive the memories of his wine merchant days, Mike Higgins decided to apply for a license plate for his car that would read VINO.
Back came a letter from the Oregon Division of Motor Vehicles turning him down. Why? Because in the Oregon agency's opinion, "vino" means "wine," and "wine" is a "drug-related word."
Mr. Higgins, who had seen many wine-related license plates in California, appealed. On Nov. 19, he testified at a State Transportation Department hearing in Medford, Ore. He asked permission to use INVINO, VINO or WINE on his license plate.
Administrative Law Judge Teresa Hogan turned him down. VINO, the judge ruled, "would cause public offense or embarrassment to the state."
Further, Mr. Higgins's driving around with WINE or VINO on his license plates "could convey the message that the state condones the use of alcoholic beverages by drivers" and "could well offend those citizens who have been victimized by intoxicated drivers."
"Wine" is banned from display on an Oregon license plate under a motor vehicles regulation defining drug-related words as those "which by denotation or connotation refer to any intoxicating liquor or controlled substance or their use."
Other no-nos under Oregon rules: "words of a vulgar nature, sex-related words, excretory words, words related to intimate body parts and ethnic words."
"To include 'wine' as part of a definition of drug-related words, while permitting 'smoke' and 'cigar' reminds me of Humpty Dumpty," Mr. Higgins said. "Humpty Dumpty said, 'When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.' "
Poking around in the state's files, Mr. Higgins discovered that a Champagne enthusiast was denied the use of 'bubbly' and an orthopedic surgeon was denied 'joint,' which might have referred to his work or to a way of relaxing from his work.
Until 1993, Mr. Higgins learned, the Oregon motor vehicles agency also banned words of a religious nature. That November, an Oregon court held that "the regulations prohibiting issuance of a custom license plate with the word 'pray' are contrary to the free speech clause of the First Amendment," and ordered the plate issued. The state chose not to appeal.
Mr. Higgins found the Motor Vehicles Division's ruling in his case ironic in light of Oregon's efforts in other contexts to promote its important wine industry. He mentioned the Oregon Winegrowers Assocation, the Wine Advisory Board, the State Wine Cellar and a state-published brochure, "Discover Oregon Wineries."
The Oregon Transportation Department, Mr. Higgins noted in a conversation, "even erects directional signs along state highways, which display those offensive, embarrassing words 'wine' and 'winery' for all to see."
He observed that wine has an important and honored place in the history, literature, art, religion and culture of Western civilization, and in the economy of Oregon. The motor vehicles agency, he added, "should remove wine from this hurtful and unnecessary association with illegal drugs, vulgar words and words that ridicule an ethnic class."
Undeterred by the state's rulings, Mr. Higgins plans to continue his crusade for the license plate. "I am placing my faith in the First Amendment and the judicial process," he said.
"It will involve considerable expense to me," he added, "but 'wine' and 'vino' will appear on Oregon license plates."
In rejecting Mr. Higgins's contention that the motor vehicles regulations are an unconstitutional infringement on the right of free speech, Judge Hogan cited two California rulings that custom license plates were a "non-public forum," subjected to "a degree of regulation greater than that permissible with respect to pure speech."
O.K., so what kind of plates does California issue to its wine lovers? Well, there are plenty of "vino" plates: VINO 1, VINO 2 and VINO MIO, to name a few. Under "wine," there are WINE JUG, WINE OHH, WINE 4U, WINE 4ME and WINE 4US. There is WINE 2GO and there is WINE SAP. Others are WINE WMN, WINE WIZ and WINE SNB, which surely refers to that despicable fellow, the wine snob.
There is even a WINE 911.
A white wine fan has CHARDNY, and what appears to be a trendy gang displays MERLOT 1, 2, 3 and 6.
Bourbon has its license plate partisans, and on a somewhat earthier plane, so does beer. Consider BEER GUT, BEER HOG, BEER HAG, BEER KEG, BEER LVR and BEER ME.
Zinfandel, the grape that California has adopted as its own, turns up frequently, often in a play on its resemblance in sound to "sin"; ZINNER and ZINFUL, for example.
There is a bit of zinfandel in Oregon, but not much. Which is just fine with Mr. Higgins because, in what must be disdain for most things Californian, the Oregon Motor Vehicles Division has allowed him a plate that reads ZIN.
 
TASTINGS
Palmer Vineyards Select Reserve 1994 (Long Island North Fork). About $20.
 
Dan Kleck, winemaker of the Palmer Vineyards, produced only 235 cases of his Select Reserve, which is a pity because this is just the kind of wine to show what remarkable things are happening on Long Island's East End these days. This wine is rich in the California style and elegant and restrained in the Bordeaux style. It is, in fact, a Bordeaux-style wine and can hold its own with almost any high-profile wine from that part of France. It derives its relatively meaningless name from the fact that a wine with a varietal name is supposed to contain at least 75 percent of that variety. In this case, the blend is 58 percent cabernet sauvignon, 34 percent merlot and 8 percent cabernet franc, all of it from Palmer Vineyards in Aquebogue, N.Y. Each varietal was fermented and barrel-aged separately. The blend was made in May 1996.

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
THERE is hope for the millions of women who worry about getting breast cancer. A fatalistic attitude that either you will get it or you will not is no longer justified. There is fast-growing evidence that simple adjustments in the way one lives can help reduce the risk of developing this increasingly common disease.
You have no doubt heard about the risk factors for breast cancer that you can do little or nothing about: starting to menstruate at a young age, entering menopause at a late age, never having had a child or having a first birth after the age of 30, having a mother, sister or maternal aunt who had breast cancer and inheriting one of the genes that are now known to account for familial breast cancer. You may have been bombarded as well by claims, thus far wholly unproved, that environmental contaminants may be causing the rise in breast cancer, which now strikes one American woman in eight sometime in her life. 
 Just three years ago, the Wellness Letter of the University of California at Berkeley stated, "There's no way to prevent breast cancer at this time." But new research has given the lie to this belief.
It is time to focus attention on the things you can do to lower your risk of developing breast cancer: what and how much you eat, how you move your body and whether you smoke cigarettes. While the importance of such factors is not as firmly established as that for cancer genes and menstrual history, the accumulating data have convinced many experts that behavioral adjustments are more than justified.
In addition to reducing your chances of getting breast cancer, they are likely to lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lung cancer and arthritis.

Exercise Protects
The first hint that exercise may help prevent breast cancer came from a study of Radcliffe graduates by Dr. Rose Frisch of Harvard University. In the preliminary study, which did not take other possible influences into account, Dr. Frisch found that those who had been physically active as young adults were less likely to develop breast cancer.
Then, just six months after publication of the Wellness Letter statement, Dr. Leslie Bernstein of the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles, who had conducted a detailed study of more than 1,000 women, reported that those who exercised 3.8 or more hours a week were less than half as likely to develop breast cancer as inactive women. The largest reduction in risk, 72 percent, was among the most active women who had had at least one full-term pregnancy. The study prompted experts to conclude that moderate but regular physical activity might be "the first controllable risk factor" for breast cancer.
Last week, researchers from Norway added to the growing evidence from a dozen studies that regular physical activity might help prevent breast cancer. In the study of more than 25,000 women, followed for an average of 14 years, researchers found that those who exercised at least four hours a week were 37 percent less likely to get breast cancer than the least active women. In conducting the study, the researchers, from the University of Tromso and the Cancer Registry of Norway in Oslo, took into account all factors known to influence breast cancer risk except economic status and smoking. Benefits resulted both from leisure-time exercise and job-related physical activity. The greatest reductions in risk were seen among lean women, those under 45 and those who exercised regularly for at least three to five years.
Exercise is believed to protect against breast cancer mainly by decreasing the amount of estrogen a woman produces in her lifetime. Exercise may delay menarche, reduce the frequency of ovulation, curb obesity in general and especially the accumulation of abdominal fat (which produces estrogen), reduce insulin levels and activate the immune system.

Diet, Weight and Smoking
As with exercise, the diet linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer can help protect against many other serious diseases. Vegetables and dietary fiber are protective, but meat may be a hazard. In a study of more than 600 women by Dr. Jo L. Freudenheim and colleagues at the State University of New York at Buffalo, premenopausal women who routinely ate the most vegetables had a 54 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer than women who ate the fewest. A study by Dr. Paolo Toniolo of New York University Medical Center linked frequent consumption of red meat to an increased risk of breast cancer. Other sources of protein had no effect on risk.
A diet low in fat but rich in fiber, as found in unrefined carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables, also appears to protect by reducing the level of circulating estrogens, according to studies at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Add to such a diet the frequent consumption of fermented dairy products (yogurt, cheese, buttermilk) and a study in the Netherlands found a 77 percent reduction in breast cancer risk.
Researchers are still hotly debating the role of dietary fat in breast cancer, but the predominant evidence suggests that too much saturated fat (the kind found in meats and dairy products) is harmful and that polyunsaturated fats (in most vegetables oils and margarines) may be harmful. One recent study of more than 6,000 women directed by Dr. Celia Byrne of Harvard Medical School linked the consumption of full-fat salad dressings, chicken skin and regular -- as opposed to lean -- ground beef to increased rates of breast cancer. But there are suggestions from studies in Spain and Greece that frequent use of mono-unsaturated fats like olive oil and canola oil may be protective.
Another question that is the subject of heated debates is the effect effect of alcohol on breast-cancer risk. Some researchers believe any amount of alcohol is harmful, but others say the increased risk associated with one drink a day is negligible, if it exists at all, and point out that a glass of wine each day appears to protect against heart disease.
Then there is the issue of body weight. In a study of 654 women in Tampa, Fla., a weight gain of 10 pounds after the age of 30 was linked to a 23 percent increase in breast cancer later in life, and a gain of 20 pounds was associated with a 52 percent increase. And Dr. Regina Ziegler of the National Cancer Institute found in a study of 1,500 Asian-American women that a recent weight gain following immigration was a strong indicator of an increased risk of breast cancer.
This means that women who quit smoking should strive to avoid gaining more than five or six pounds. Smoking can greatly increase breast cancer risk among women whose bodies produce a slow-acting version of an enzyme, N-acetyltransferase, that detoxifies carcinogens in cigarette smoke. A study by the State University of New York at Buffalo found a fivefold increase in risk among women with this enzyme who smoked more than a pack a day.

HEADLINE: Crawfish Wars: Cajun Country Vs. China

BYLINE: By DONNA ST. GEORGE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, La.

 BODY:
THEY glisten, boiled bright red, heaps and heaps of spiced whole crawfish spread across a dinner table deep in the heart of Cajun country. It's a weeknight at Dwight Landreneau's house, not a weekend, but zydeco music fills the room, and someone has popped open a beer.
Only in crawfish season is such a feast possible. 
 "This is the best time of year," Mr. Landreneau declared, presiding over 60 pounds of the piping hot crustaceans, with his wife, three daughters, mother, sister-in-law and nephew. "Heck, we boiled crawfish here three times last week."
The Landreneaus are deeply rooted in this southern Louisiana region of rolling farmland and backwater bayous claimed and cultivated by their Cajun ancestors. For them, the glory of crawfish -- as Louisianians call crayfish -- is as much about taste as it is about tradition and culture. But even in this season of plenty, they and others fear that this hard-shelled symbol of their heritage is slipping away.
Louisiana's crawfish industry is in the battle of its life, its position as the country's leading purveyor of the delicately sweet meat threatened by a flood of less-expensive imports from China. Desperate to hang on to a living and a way of life, the industry has petitioned the Federal Government for an import tariff. A final decision is expected in September.
In the meantime, even many well-known Louisiana restaurants that cater to visitors in search of local flavor have come to serve Chinese crawfish in the region's most celebrated dishes: crawfish pie, bisque, etouffee and gumbo. And at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, which ended on Sunday, the rich sauces and thick breadings of Cajun fare were often lavished upon the Chinese imports rather than the local crawfish.
"The sad part is that a lot of people don't know the difference, because they've never tasted crawfish," said Paul Prudhomme, the Louisiana chef credited with igniting the Cajun cooking craze in the 1980's.
The success of imported crawfish in a state so dedicated to its cuisine has had everything to do with cost. Although prices for the Louisiana meat, which are seasonal, have dropped in the last two weeks, one jazz-festival chef noted that when he ordered peeled crawfish tails, the choice was either the Chinese import, at $3.50 a pound, or the Louisiana meat, at $8.
"This strikes at our culture, our food and our jobs," said Mr. Landreneau, an aquaculture agent for the state's Cooperative Extension Service. He added: "The crawfish industry is not major corporations. It's not Xerox. It's not Monsanto. It's individual families."
But on the opposite side of the issue, Chinese exporters point out that American consumers have benefited from the imports, with both lower prices and a steadier supply. "I think the reality is that they don't want to face the competition," said Bill Brutocao, a lawyer in Pasadena, Calif., who represents many of the Chinese exporters. "They don't like the idea of not having a monopoly."
In the rural hamlet of Church Point, La., where the land is luminously green by early spring and the warm air is dense with humidity, Larry Miller is a farmer -- one of about 1,500 who raise crawfish so that they can be boiled and fried and sauteed in kitchens all over America.
Mr. Miller cultivates crawfish the way others grow corn or wheat. He plows his land to create ponds, floods the ponds with aerated water and coaxes the best harvest he can from 100 acres. In the last few years, however, the crawfish market has changed drastically. Gone are the days when he could fish his ponds in a flat-bottom boat into late May and still make a profit. Now, he drains his land in April, giving up even as the season is at its peak.
"The price gets real low," said Mr. Miller, a tall, quiet man with graying hair, as he steered his aluminum craft toward one crawfish trap and then another in his farmland pond in early April. "It gets to where it doesn't pay to fish."
Part of the grim economic equation has to do with the abundance of Louisiana crawfish at season's peak. But the more troubling issue for farmers is the deluge of imports, which are often cheaper by half.
Nearly all the Chinese crawfish is peeled tail meat, frozen, in one-pound plastic bags, competing with peeled Louisiana tail meat. Both are used in etouffees (rich stews, with the tails smothered in a brown sauce), Cajun popcorn and other prepared dishes.
"If you've got a housewife," said Mr. Miller, "and she's trying to feed five kids on a budget, there's no question which she's going to buy."
The numbers bear him out. Sales of the Chinese imports skyrocketed from $3.2 million in 1993 to $35.7 million in 1995, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the International Trade Commission. By then, Chinese imports accounted for 80 percent of the United States market for tail meat, compared with 25 percent in 1993.
Louisiana crawfish are also sold live or already boiled whole. And farmers like Mr. Miller contend that those markets have declined in this era of heavy imports.
Uncertain about the future, Mr. Miller has supported his fellow farmers in their petition for a tariff on the Chinese product. Their goal, they say, is not to stop imports but to make competition fairer.
As Dexter Guillory, a crawfish processor in Eunice, La., said: "There's room for crawfish tail meat besides Louisiana's. But we want part of our own market."
Louisiana loved crawfish even when the rest of the country hardly knew what it was. Nowhere was the ardor stronger than in Cajun country, this sprawling land of swamps and bayous west of New Orleans.
Enola Prudhomme, an acclaimed Louisiana chef and a sister of Paul Prudhomme, remembers the glee that followed heavy storms at her family's farm near Opelousas, La., in the 1940's. Crawfish would flood from the swamps into nearby fields and ditches. "You could come home with sacks of them," she recalled.
The golden era for crawfish began in the late 60's, when the commercial market expanded and farmers started raising them in ponds. They soon discovered that crawfish was an ideal rotation crop for those who grew rice. As the market expanded, so did the cuisine. Crawfish was made into pies and bisques and puffs and casseroles. It was served over fettuccine, mixed with eggplant, stuffed into sausage, baked in bread, rolled into sushi.
If the world of food is divided into salty and sweet foods, crawfish "is the candy of the salty world," Mr. Prudhomme said. "It has a very sweet, creamy, twice-as-rich-as-lobster taste."
"You know how lobster tastes better with butter?" he added. "Crawfish tastes like that naturally."
This deep appreciation is perhaps best demonstrated in Louisiana's sacred rite of spring: the crawfish boil. At heart, it is a big party in which 24-gallon pots of spicy, bubbling water are filled with live crawfish that cook until they turn a perfect shade of red.
"Everyone has their own secret recipe for how much lemon juice goes in the water and how much cayenne pepper and how much vinegar," said Dr. Jules d'Hemecourt, a professor of mass communications at Louisiana State University, who also studies Cajun culture. "It's a point of pride."
At crawfish boils, friends and relatives -- a handful or a hundred -- gather around newspaper-covered tables on which steaming shellfish are heaped into piles along with boiled side courses: corn on the cob, whole potatoes and onions and sometimes cabbage or Cajun sausage.
People dig in with bare hands -- beer on the table, music playing, stories unfolding.
"It's the thing to do on Friday afternoon," said John Ed Laborde, the Mayor of the Cajun-country town of Marksville, La. "But," he added with a chuckle, "any day is legal."
Chinese crawfish arrived in noticeable quantities in Louisiana in 1991. At first, people laughed. Crawfish is to Louisiana what wine is to France. Who would buy a substitute from China? "In the first couple of years, there was a lot of resistance to the Chinese product," recalled Mr. Guillory, the processor, who owns Riceland Crawfish Inc. in Eunice. "But over time, people tried it. And it wasn't as good as the Louisiana crawfish, for a lot of reasons. But it was good enough, for $2 a pound."
The question of whether the import is as good as domestic crawfish has been hotly debated.
Some critics describe it as tougher and more rubbery. "It doesn't cook the same, and the texture's not the same," said Melinda LeBlanc of Breaux Bridge, La.
But others call the Chinese product a dead ringer when it is deep-fried or cooked into a etouffee or stew. Then, it's very hard to tell the difference, said Pierre Hilzim, the president of Kajun Kettle Foods Inc., a New Orleans company that prepares food for national restaurant chains.
With that reasoning, many restaurants in Louisiana and the country, including New York, have opted for Chinese meat.
For the last several years, "Louisiana may have been $11 a pound, where the Chinese has been $4.50, less than half," said Gerald Faulk, the owner of Acadia Parish, a Cajun restaurant in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. "In order to stay in business, you have to look at that."
But at Prejean's Restaurant in Lafayette, La., where a 14-foot stuffed alligator graces the dining room, James Graham, the executive chef, considers himself one of a few restaurateurs "lucky enough" to be able to use Louisiana meat. He buys peeled Louisiana crawfish tails in bulk -- thousands of pounds -- in season, when prices are lower by several dollars a pound, so that he can remain loyal to Louisiana at a relatively low cost. But many chefs don't have the resources for such bulk buying, he said, adding, "Your chef's job is at stake."
Gail Troncoso, who with her husband, Ken, has catered at the jazz festival for 13 years, said that she buys more Chinese meat than Louisiana meat but that her Louisiana vendor has said his business has not been hurt by the imports.
In grocery and seafood stores, the two products look nearly identical, except for three words on the bag in small print: "Product of China."
"People sympathize with us, but the bottom line is price," concluded Harold Benoit, a co-chairman of the Louisiana Crawfish Coalition, a group of farmers, fishers, processors and suppliers formed to fight the low-cost imports.
"It's like anything else," he added. "There are very few people who won't drive a Nissan or a Toyota."
On the other side of the crawfish question are people like Elton Bernard, the owner of Bernard's Cajun Crawfish in the New Orleans suburb of Marrero. Last year, he supplied stores and restaurants with four million pounds of Chinese crawfish.
Mr. Bernard, of Cajun heritage, has little sympathy for the outcry from Louisiana's crawfish community. He points out that Louisianians export many of their biggest crawfish to Sweden, where the crustaceans command a premium price. They should not complain, then, when they are on the other side of the trade table, he said.
Mr. Bernard also argues that the crawfish industry has not been nearly as hurt as it has portrayed itself, emphasizing that most farmers have other crops and that fishermen -- there are 1,100 of them -- often have other seasonal jobs.
In China, Mr. Bernard said, 27 processing plants produce tail meat for his company. Workers get housing and other amenities and are paid the equivalent of 15 cents an hour, he said, or $9 for a 60-hour workweek.
American-made items can hardly compete with such low labor costs, he acknowledged. "But it isn't just crawfish," he said. "Ninety percent of what you buy in stores -- you look at the little stickers and they say, 'China': jewelry, fireworks, Nike shoes."
The way he sees it, Chinese crawfish has been good for consumers, who have saved money, and good for Louisiana cuisine, because people cook it more. "People have learned how to cook more dishes," he said, "and how to eat crawfish tails three times a week instead of one."
The battle is far from over, but the Louisiana crawfish industry has won the early rounds.
On March 19, the Commerce Department issued a preliminary ruling that Chinese crawfish imports should be subject to a tariff averaging 110 percent of the point-of-entry price. The proposed levy, which the International Trade Commission will review and could reject, is intended to help Louisiana producers.
It was not quite the twofold or threefold tax that crawfish farmers had hoped for. But as Mr. Benoit, of the crawfish coalition, said, "It is adequate to let us compete."
Mr. Benoit figures that such a tariff, based on an average point-of-entry cost of $2.50 a pound, would raise the wholesale price of Chinese crawfish to at least $5.25 a pound, roughly equal to production costs of Louisiana crawfish.
On the contrary, Mr. Bernard, the importer, predicted that a tariff would not end up being imposed. "They can't prove they lost all that money," he said.
In Cajun country, though, word about the proposed tax has relighted the hopes of farmers, processors and fishers. "Taking crawfish out of Louisiana," Mr. Landreneau mused, "would be like taking the barbecue out of Texas."
 
Changing a Way of Life
CRAWFISH are delivered from swamp to dinner table by two kinds of people. There are farmers like Larry Miller, who raises them in ponds. Then there are fishermen like Clyde Peltier, who sinks traps in the wild.
During crawfish season, from late January through June, Mr. Peltier is out on his 19-foot aluminum fishing boat every weekday morning before the sun rises, gliding through the 800,000-acre wooded swampland known as the Atchafalaya Basin, in south-central Louisiana. It is a primitive-looking place, where gnarly cypresses rise from still water, limbs broken and draped in moss, and where alligators lurk beneath the surface. It is also a prime breeding ground for crawfish. And in 20 years, Mr. Peltier says, he has trapped 100,000 pounds of them there.
In good times, Mr. Peltier simply would go out every day and trap what he could. When the day was done, he would sell his crawfish for a decent price and go home. But now, processors don't want all his crawfish, because they aren't able to sell them all. So, they essentially limit how much Mr. Peltier can catch.
"Instead of catching 40 sacks, we might only catch half that," he said. "And with the Chinese meat on the market, our price is way down. I would estimate my income is down 30 to 40 percent every year since the Chinese crawfish came to Louisiana."
But for Mr. Peltier, the problem is larger than economics. It's about loyalty to Louisiana -- and to a Louisiana way of life. "I've been doing this 20 years," he said. "But there are fathers and grandfathers who have been doing this, golly, for generations."
At L. T. West Inc., a processor in Mamou, La., Craig West is part of one of those families. His father, Harry, raised crawfish on the family farm and then opened one of the first processing plants in the early 1970's.
Craig and his brother, Troy, grew up fishing for their father after school, doing well enough so that Troy remembers paying for his dog, Duke, and his first shotgun with crawfish proceeds. As adults, the West brothers followed in their father's path, with crawfish farming and, later, processing.
Three years ago, the Chinese competition hit them hard. "If we got our crawfish for free, we couldn't sell at a price that low," Craig West said.
The Wests have made do by shifting their focus to live crawfish -- and by seldom processing tail meat. But the live market has been flooded by processors who have taken the same approach. "We're struggling, just hanging on by a very thin layer," Craig West said. "It's going to kill the industry."
For now, the Wests are facing some grim choices. "Somebody's going to have to get a welding job or something else," Craig West said. "With this Chinese thing, we both can't stay here. One of us is going to have to leave the farm." DONNA ST. GEORGE

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Japan Stocks, German Views And British Rates Hurt Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday, dragged down by a Japanese stock rally, remarks by a Bundesbank official and a rise in British interest rates.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 125.40 yen, down from 126.53 yen on Monday and at 1.7228 marks, down from 1.7324 marks. The pound rose to $1.6337 from $1.6228. The dollar also fell against the Swiss franc, the French franc and the Italian lira. 
 The dollar began falling in Asian trading after the Nikkei index of 225 issues surged 3.4 percent to its highest level since December.
"There's a desire to be back in Japanese assets," said Alfonso Alejo, senior proprietary trader at the Sakura Bank. "The dollar seems to be real heavy."
The dollar's decline accelerated after Ernst Welteke, a council member of the Bundesbank, said, "We couldn't be enthusiastic if the dollar continued to rise." Reports also quoted him as saying that the central bank did not want the dollar to rise to 1.7350 marks, and that an exchange rate of 1.70 marks would reflect economic fundamentals.
"Welteke made a strong dollar-capping statement," said Andrew Hodge, currency strategist at Bank Brussels Lambert.
While Mr. Welteke expressed concern over a stronger dollar, he also said he did not expect the Bundesbank would act to stop its rise.
A spokesman for Mr. Welteke, Hans-Peter Basler, later said that Mr. Welteke did not mention a specific target exchange rate for the dollar. "He said he was happy with a dollar around 1.70 marks," Mr. Basler said. "A couple of pfennigs here and there around that level wouldn't make much difference."
The dollar slumped against the British pound after the new Labor Government raised interest rates a quarter percentage point and gave the central bank independence in setting rates in the future.
Higher British rates bolster the pound by making deposits and bonds denominated in the currency more attractive. Giving the Bank of England independence in setting monetary policy is also expected to help the pound as the central bank has in the past called for more and bigger rate rises than the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Marriott International is switching to a much broader reward program for its frequent guests.

BYLINE: By Paul Burnham Finney 

 BODY:
WITH frequent-travel awards practically a second national currency, Marriott International is scrapping its popular 14-year-old Honored Guest Awards program and starting a much broader one called Marriott Rewards.
The hotel and resort chain's nine million frequent-guest members will now be able to earn and use points at some 1,000 hotels worldwide. That's an increase of 700, thanks to the inclusion of the budget Fairfield Inns and Courtyards, as well as Marriott's suites, conference centers and time-share villas. 
 Even though luxury hotels tend to look down their noses at frequent-guest incentives, Marriott is using its leverage as controlling owner of the Ritz-Carlton chain to bring eight Ritzes into the program. And they are some of the chain's best hotels -- in Atlanta; Maui, one of the Hawaiian Islands; Kansas City, Mo.; Marina del Rey, Calif.; Naples, Fla.; Philadelphia, and St. Thomas, V.I.
This fall Marriott will add its newest brand, Executive Residences, to the program. And in all likelihood the company's 230 longer-stay Residence Inns and 150 newly acquired Renaissance hotels will join the Marriott Rewards crowd next year.
 
Saving Lives Aloft
Right now, AMR's American Airlines is installing fixtures on 278 aircraft -- about 40 percent of its fleet -- to hold defibrillators, the medical devices for reviving victims of sudden cardiac arrest
. "Two to three dozen times a year we'll make an emergency landing because a passenger is experiencing a heart problem," said John Hotard, an American spokesman. "Even that won't be soon enough if your heart stops."
That's why defibrillation aloft rather than on the ground can be truly lifesaving. "For each minute that it's delayed, the chance of survival decreases 7 percent," said David K. McKenas, the corporate medical director for the airline. More than a thousand people a day in the United States suffer sudden cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart Association.
Only three carriers worldwide -- Australia's Qantas Airways, the Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic and Air Zimbabwe -- now carry defibrillators, which administer an electric shock to the victim's heart. American's devices, which will be initially installed in aircraft that fly over-the-water routes far from land, are about the same size and weight as a laptop computer. They include printed and voice prompts, but American is training 2,300 cabin attendants to operate them.
By July 1 approximately 300 defibrillators on American's planes and at its hubs and other key locations will be ready to go into action.
 
Beating Hotel Inflation
With hotel space tight and rates escalating, business travelers -- particularly those who work for smaller companies or are self-employed -- can beat inflation by booking through hotel discount services.
One that many travelers have found to be reliable and worthwhile is Quikbook, which is based in New York and has a toll-free number (800 789-9887) and World Wide Web site (www.quikbook.com). For example, a single at Loews New York that costs $235 at the standard rate is available through Quikbook for $129. And if you shop around, that's anywhere from $10 to $96 lower than the rates of competing discounters. At the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco, Quikbook can bring in a single with a $245 regular rate for $150. Such deals are available at about 100 upscale hotels in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington.
There's no magic in Quikbook's method: it simply passes along a volume discount of 40 to 60 percent that it negotiates with hotels, just as companies do to obtain lower corporate rates. Quikbook does not nickel-and-dime its clients with membership fees and charges for canceling or changing reservations. And there is no prepayment -- guests only need to provide a credit card number that is not used until they check in.
Other nationwide discount services include Hotel Reservations Network (800 964-6835), Room Exchange (800 846-7000) and Central Reservation Service (800 548-3311).
 
Long-Haul Luxury
One of the few things that can help make up for the mind-numbing boredom of long overseas flights is the high quality of service, if the latest Zagat Airline Survey of 10,000 frequent fliers is any guide. Of the 10 top-rated airlines, 7 fly long-distance Pacific Rim and trans-Pacific routes. The winners (in the order they were rated), with only one United States carrier among them, were: Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Swissair, Midwest Express, Japan Airlines, Thai International Airways, All Nippon Airways, Qantas, Air New Zealand and S.A.S..
Most of the survey participants were business travelers and travel industry professionals who were not likely to be flying in the back of the bus. They might have taken a dimmer view of their airline favorites sitting in a cramped 3-4-3 (or worse) configuration in economy class.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 10.83, to 7,225.32, but Most Indexes Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average struggled to another new high, but most stock measures dipped yesterday as investors secured some profits from the market's stunning rebound of recent weeks.
The Dow pulled back into positive territory just before the close, rising 10.83 points, to 7,225.32, after surrendering an afternoon gain of 55 points. 
 Broader indicators edged lower on heavy volume, with the technology-laden Nasdaq market snapping a six-session winning streak.
"With the explosive gains over the past six days or so, it's normal to see some profit taking," said Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Company of Greenwich, Conn. "To expect that type of explosive mood to continue, one would have to be extremely bullish."
On Monday, the Dow surged by 143.29 points, or 2.03 percent, shooting above 7,200 for the first time. It closed at 7,214.49.
The mood dampened yesterday, however, as investors considered whether a market that seemed overpriced at these levels in March has more potential to move higher now.
Notably, stocks were pressured throughout the session by the bond market, where interest rates edged higher amid indications of strong retail activity. The report on chain store sales also suggested that April's retail sales were hurt more by the weather than waning consumer demand.
That countered last week's burst of enthusiasm that the economy would slow enough to keep inflationary pressures under control, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore.
Investors have been worried that the Federal Reserve, trying to protect against rapid inflation by slowing the pace of borrowing and spending, will raise interest rates too aggressively and hurt company profits.
The central bank raised one of its key lending rates in late March, fueling the market's steep selloff, and is widely expected to increase rates again at a May 20 policy meeting.
Reinforcing the optimism that the vigorous economic pace may be slowing, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders to United States factories slipped 1.6 percent in March, the largest drop in seven months.
The number of advancing issues was about even with decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 603.7 million shares, the seventh-busiest day in the exchange's history.
The Standard & Poor's 500 list -- up nearly 65 points, or 8.5 percent, over the previous six sessions -- fell 2.48, to 827.76, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.66, to 430.77. Both measures closed at record highs in Monday's rally.
The Nasdaq composite index, which rose more than 5 percent in the prior two sessions and nearly 11 percent in the previous six, fell 10.94, to 1,328.30. Among the bellwether technology issues that led the recent Nasdaq advance, Intel fell 4 1/2, to 158. Intel's stock was hurt by reports of a possible flaw in its new Pentium II chip.
Cisco Systems fell 1 1/8, to 57 3/4, in advance of an earnings report. The stock had rallied for several previous sessions.
Prominent among the Dow's gainers were cyclical issues, which are more dependent on the economic pace and had not risen as sharply in the recent rally. Du Pont rose 2 1/4, to 110 1/4; Alcoa rose 1 3/4, to 72 3/8; General Motors rose 1, to 58 5/8, and Union Carbide rose 1, to 49 3/4.
Philip Morris was the Dow's weakest issue, falling 2 3/8, to 41 3/4. The cigarette maker's stock surged Monday on news that a Florida jury had cleared RJR Nabisco of liability for the death of a lifelong smoker. RJR also gave back part of Monday's big gain, falling 2 3/8, to 30 1/4.
Among other issues, America Online, fell 2 1/2, to 49. The stock retreated after jumping 9 percent on Monday in advance of its earnings report.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Declined 1.6% in March

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Orders placed with factories fell 1.6 percent in March, the largest decline in seven months, indicating that the manufacturing economy might be cooling.
Today's report from the Commerce Department also showed that inventories increased two-tenths of 1 percent in March after having risen four-tenths of 1 percent in February, suggesting production may have outpaced demand. 
 In a separate report, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey of purchasing managers found that they expected corporate revenue to rise 7 percent this year as the economy continued to grow solidly with only modest inflation.
The Commerce Department said much of the 1.6 percent decline in March factory orders was caused by weaker demand for aircraft, autos, electronics and industrial hardware. In February, orders rose a revised four-tenths of 1 percent.
"If orders and shipments fail to rebound next month, then the alarm bells should start ringing -- but not just yet," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York.
The March decline was the largest since a 2.1 percent drop in August 1996. It may set the stage for somewhat slower economic growth in the second quarter; in the first quarter, the economy expanded at a 5.6 percent annual rate, the fastest pace in more than nine years.
Many economists expect Federal Reserve policy makers will raise the overnight bank lending rate again at their meeting later this month. In March, concerned about the pace of economic expansion, they increased the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
Taking a different view, Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said factory orders fell in all major categories in March. It was an "unmistakable sign" of less rapid economic growth, he said. "The economy is already slowing down, and the Federal Reserve doesn't need to hit the brakes any harder," he added.
Outside of the volatile category of aircraft and other transportation equipment, factory orders decreased 1.2 percent during March. Excluding the military industry, they declined 1.4 percent.
 By category, orders for durable goods, which are made to last three or more years, declined 2.6 percent after having increased 1 percent in February. In an advance report on April 29, the Commerce Department had said orders for durable goods fell 3 percent in March.
 Orders for nondurable goods, like food and clothing, decreased three-tenths of 1 percent in March.
Shipments, a gauge of current demand, fell one-tenth of 1 percent during March. Unfilled factory orders, a measure of pent-up demand, decreased four-tenths of 1 percent.
The purchasing managers' prediction that corporate revenues would rise 7 percent this year represented an increase from the previous survey, last December, when they put 1997 revenue growth at 5.4 percent. In 1996, revenues grew 4.9 percent.
The latest semiannual survey found that the purchasing managers expected no major slowdown in business conditions later this year. About 48 percent of the managers said their companies would have more business in the second half than in the first half, while 13 percent expected weaker business conditions and the remaining 39 percent expected no change. Seventy-five percent expected higher business output this year.
The managers said they expected the prices of the goods they buy for their corporations to rise seven-tenths of 1 percent this year, a signal that inflation is not likely to accelerate sharply. In the December survey, they had predicted no change in those costs this year.
The managers also expect the costs of labor and fringe benefits to rise a net 2.4 percent this year, below the 2.8 percent increase in employment costs that they expected in the December survey.
The survey found that manufacturers increased production capacity 5.3 percent in 1996 and are likely to add a further 4.9 percent this year. Newer, more efficient plant and equipment often permit corporations to cut product costs, reducing the threat of inflation.

HEADLINE: California to Let Small Customers Pick Their Power Suppliers in '98

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
California regulators said yesterday that they would speed up a plan to allow utility customers to buy electricity from any supplier of their choosing by 1998.
The decision by the California Public Utilities Commission is expected to put pressure on a number of states, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, that are also in the process of deregulating their utility markets. 
 California has become a model -- the first state to devise a system allowing in outside, low-cost producers while at the same time protecting local utilities that will still transmit power and maintain the distribution system.
Under an earlier timetable put into effect by the State Legislature last fall, large industrial and commercial customers would have been able to buy their own electricity beginning in 1998, with smaller customers getting that right by 2002.
The commission, however, recently began to favor opening the market to everyone more quickly. Its administrative law judge recommended the faster pace in a decision on March 12.
"They reached a consensus to move fast," Steve Kline, vice president for regulation of Pacific Gas and Electric, the state's largest utility, said in an interview. He said that his company, a unit of the P.G.& E. Corporation, and other utilities supported the commission's decision.
The decision comes amid growing criticism by consumer advocates, who have said that larger industrial and commercial customers, many of which have already received big rate reductions from their utilities, would get further breaks under deregulation.
The State Legislature, however, has worked out an elaborate financing mechanism under which smaller residential and commercial customers will get a rate reduction of 10 percent beginning in 1998.
Thus, smaller customers who decide to do nothing and still get their power from the state's major utilities in 1998 will be guaranteed a rate reduction of 10 percent.
Also, customers who want to take their chances with an outside supplier and and are not satisfied will be able to go back to their utility after giving adequate notice.
Some pilot programs, where customers are getting experience with choosing their own power supplier, such as one now in progress in New Hampshire, have found that many customers become confused by all the different pitches made by marketers and decide to stay with their utility.
California's millions of customers can expect to be deluged by phone calls from telemarketers and to receive numerous mailings from power marketers. About 1,000 marketers ranging from sales subsidiaries of utilities to independent power producers to small entrepreneurs have contacted the commission about setting up shop in the state.
"Consumers will have trouble eating their dinner," Mr. Kline of Pacific Gas and Electric said. "On top of the current load of phone companies that are calling, you will have a bunch of power marketers."
Customers will be able to put in requests to buy from other sources beginning on Nov. 1. Those who will want at least half their load supplied from renewable sources will be processed first.
Marketers of electricity are expected to try to put together larger groups of customers -- for example, around a town government or a complex of buildings -- to make it worth their while since it will be difficult to make money chasing individual small customers.
California was one of the first states to begin the complex process of deregulating its utilities beginning in 1995.
A variety of interests in the state -- utilities, large industries, groups representing smaller consumers, and the independent power producers -- sought to work out their differences and to a degree succeeded in fashioning a compromise that became the basis for the current plan.
One of the hardest issues was how to deal with the $20 billion to $30 billion of what are called stranded costs. Under competition, many power plants of utilities will no longer be economical, and past contracts signed with independent power producers guaranteeing them high prices cannot be continued.
The question was how to pay back the utilities for such costs. The Legislature worked out a mechanism that resembles a Rube Goldberg contraption.
To reimburse part of the stranded costs, the state will issue bonds to be paid off through special fees charged to the smaller residential and commercial consumers using electricity.
Once the utilities get the money from the bonds, they will be able to reduce rates by 10 percent for smaller residential and commercial customers. In effect, these customers will finance their own rate reduction.

HEADLINE: BRITAIN'S NEW TACK: THE BANKER;
Veteran Governor to Have Freer Invisible Hand on Rate Policy

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
It's Eddie's show now.
Britons used to refer jokingly to the polite public sparring over interest rate policy between Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Edward A. J. George, the governor of the Bank of England, as "The Ken and Eddie Show." 
 Thanks to Gordon Brown, the new Labor Government's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. George, 58, a solid central banker with a reputation for reliability and toughness, should have more leeway in adjusting interest rates to try to achieve greater price stability without Government interference.
Mr. Brown, as he announced yesterday, is giving Mr. George and the Bank of England full operational independence, something the bank has quietly but unofficially wanted for many years. It is eager to insure that "the right decisions are taken on interest rates," as one insider put it yesterday.
Eddie George, as the 35-year veteran of the Bank of England is generally known, was appointed governor for a five-year term that began July 1, 1993. He is expected to use the bank's greater independence to continue pursuing a vigorous anti-inflation policy that to his delight the Government gave the Bank of England as a mandate when he was appointed.
But there has been friction between the bank and the Government over when to raise interest rates and by how much. In the weeks before Britain's general election last Thursday, for example, Mr. George was apparently eager to raise interest rates to head off inflationary pressure, but the Conservative Government balked at such a measure just before an election.
Nevertheless, the views of Mr. George, who has managed to preserve a reputation both for loyalty and for skepticism, became widely known. Unlike some previous bank governors, Mr. George has made his own way in life. The son of a postal clerk, he won a local government scholarship to Dulwich College, a respected London secondary school, from which he went on to study economics at Cambridge University. After graduating in 1962, he joined the Bank of England, rising first on the international side and then through its markets division.
The greater independence being given Mr. George and the Bank of England is expected to bring Britain more into line with American and German central banking traditions. The Federal Reserve Board and the Bundesbank have both long enjoyed greater freedom from political interference. Until now, Mr. George and his colleagues have advised the Treasury on rate policy. Now through a proposed monetary policy committee, they should be freer to carry out those policies themselves.
"It's the establishment of a Federal Reserve-type system," said Geoffrey E. Dennis, a British economist who is a global emerging market strategist at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. He expects Mr. George to continue to try to squeeze inflation out of the British economy. "From the tone of those meetings," between Mr. Clarke and Mr. George, "he's come across as pretty tough, showing all the signs of being a a very tough central bank governor," he said.
Particularly since the pound was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, Mr. George has been cautious and is very likely to use the new independence to argue that there must be much greater convergence of national economic policies before Britain can seriously plan to join the European Monetary Union. "Our concern," Mr. George said in a speech last month to the Foreign Bankers Association in Amsterdam, "is that premature monetary union," between countries with insufficiently convergent economic policies, "would put European prosperity at unnecessary risk."
Not that Mr. George is an isolationist or a Euroskeptic. Early in his career at the Bank of England in the mid-1960's, he attended Moscow State University to learn Russian and worked on Eastern European matters. He also worked three years in Basel, Switzerland, at the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank, and two years at the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
The Labor Government, however, is not giving all the cards to Mr. George, a keen bridge player. Under the prospective changes outlined by Mr. Brown yesterday, a monetary policy committee would be set up; it would include Mr. George; Howard Davies, the deputy governor; a second deputy governor, who has yet to be appointed; two other senior Bank of England executives, and four other officials appointed from outside the Bank of England.
By proposing greater independence for the bank, the Labor Government is effectively saying it will not be so directly involved in monetary policy. If so, it would end several decades when successive governments -- both Conservative and Labor -- have frequently meddled with interest rate policy, often to improve their short-term political fortunes without much regard for the longer-term economic consequences.
That, as Mr. George said in his speech in Amsterdam last month, has left Britain with "a fairly checkered monetary history since the Second World War," often contributing to Britain's "exaggerated boom-bust economic cycle."

HEADLINE: GTE Discloses 3 Big Deals In Growth Bid

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Bidding to become a major operator of corporate data networks, the GTE Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $616 million in cash to acquire the BBN Corporation, one of the nation's biggest Internet service companies.
The acquisition announcement was part of three deals so far this week that are meant to reposition GTE, the nation's largest local telephone company, as a leader in data networks with a national reach. If the friendly takeover is approved by shareholders of both companies, GTE will be set to open a new round of fierce competition against the big long-distance companies, including the AT&T Corporation. 
 "We are undergoing very dramatic, fundamental change in our industry," Charles R. Lee, GTE's chairman, said yesterday in an interview. "We are becoming a nationwide provider of telecommunications services -- voice, data and video."
Besides the BBN deal, GTE on Monday announced a $485 million agreement to buy 25 percent of a new national fiber optic network being built by the Qwest Communications Corporation, a unit of the Anschutz Corporation. Yesterday, GTE said it had also formed an alliance with Cisco Systems Inc., the leading maker of data networking equipment, to develop new products and services and buy as much as $1 billion in products from Cisco over the next five years.
"They are targeting the bread and butter of business networks, like Exxon connecting all its gas stations or Merrill Lynch connecting all of its offices," said David Goodtree, an analyst with Forrester Research in Boston. "These are contracts that range from thousands of dollars a year to tens of millions of dollars a year, and local telcos don't play there -- until now."
Mr. Goodtree said that AT&T is the leader in running national corporate networks, with about 60 percent of a $12 billion market, followed by the MCI Communications Corporation, the Sprint Corporation and Worldcom Inc.
In BBN, GTE is acquiring Internet expertise but not huge market share. The deregulation and consolidation of the telecommunications industry have left the company a burly midget in an arena of giants. BBN stagnated recently as it scraped for capital to expand its already-extensive network.
"It's obvious that we don't have global scale or reach or the necessary financial resources to compete going forward," said George H. Conrades, BBN's chairman. "Together we are an almost perfect strategic fit -- our technology and their resources."
A former I.B.M. executive who has been with BBN only three years, Mr. Conrades provided no details of his future plans yesterday.
GTE will offer BBN's stockholders $29 a share and would assume BBN's debt of about $70 million.
In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of BBN soared $6.25, to $28.875, while GTE shares lost $1.125, falling to $45.
Some investors sold their GTE stock on the company's forecast that as a result of the BBN and Qwest deals it no longer expected to meet Wall Street's estimates for 1997 earnings. Analysts polled by First Call Inc. before the merger announcement had been predicting full-year earnings of $3.18 a share.
But GTE said yesterday that it expected 1997 earnings to be "flat to slightly positive" relative to the 1996 figure of $2.92 a share. A person close to the company said that the 1997 figure would be no more than $3 a share.
Separately, BBN announced its financial results yesterday for the quarter that ended March 31. The company lost $12.2 million, or 58 cents a share, on revenue of $95.9 million -- an improvement over the comparable period last year, when the company lost $29.1 million on sales of $60.8 million.
Mr. Lee said that the deals announced yesterday would enable GTE to demonstrate consistent annual earnings growth of 13 to 15 percent by 1999, up from the 10 percent target the company had adopted in recent years. He predicted that in 2001 the company will have annual revenue of at least $34 billion, up from 1996 revenue of $21.3 billion.
Wall Street was also concerned that GTE may have to sweeten its offer for BBN to fend off a rival bid from AT&T, which currently carries most of its own customers' corporate private data traffic but subcontracts much of its Internet business to BBN's network. AT&T, however, said it had no plans to bid for BBN.
"No, we're not going to do it," said Mike Miller, an AT&T spokesman, adding that AT&T considers its own network sufficient for its needs. "It's not true."
Mr. Miller, however, called back a short time later to say that AT&T's policy was to decline to comment on market rumors.
But if GTE succeeds in buying BBN, it would complicate AT&T's data-networking business. BBN, one of the inventors of the Internet by dint of having built and managed the predecessor Arpanet for the Pentagon in the 1960's and 1970's, now carries most of the network traffic for AT&T's Internet service, among other clients.
BBN's three-year contract with AT&T runs through the summer of 1998and has a value of $120 million. And though AT&T has an option to legally withdraw from the deal if BBN changes hands, Mr. Miller, the AT&T spokesman, said his company had not yet decided whether it would exercise that option.
GTE is not the first telephone company to buy a big Internet operator. In April 1996 MFS Communications, a competitor in many cities to the local telephone company for business customers, bought Uunet Technologies, a company that was similar to BBN, only bigger. Later that year MFS was acquired by Worldcom, the fourth-largest long-distance carrier.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So how weird is this? The Clinton Presidency that began with such grandiose designs has become so becalmed, so shrunken, so defeated, so aimless, so anomic, so technical that George Bush now looms as a giant who bestrode the earth.
Clinton White House reporters tell me they "envy" my time covering Mr. Bush, that he seems more "interesting." The Bush domestic policy, known as "status-quo plus," suddenly looks retroactively ambitious, compared with Clinton drift. 
 "It turns out that was an activist Presidency," says Michael Duffy, a Time reporter who co-wrote a book on the Bush years called "Marching in Place." "After briefings with Erskine Bowles, you begin to yearn for five minutes of good, old-fashioned abuse from John Sununu."
Compared with the listless President hobbled by crutches and investigations, paralyzed by the fear of offending anyone, his 72-year-old predecessor appears the master of his fate -- skydiving and holding up rabbit ears behind his wife's head at the Gerald Ford museum rededication.
Mr. Bush laid the groundwork for the new budget deal. And Points of Light, much mocked by Democrats in '92, is practically all that remains of Bill Clinton's social policy.
I faxed the ex-President in Houston to tell him he was looming large.
"Looming Large? With whom, for whom?" he faxed back, in one of his famous free-form letters ("self typed I might add"). He requested that I read the note and then "eat it."
Before addressing my questions, Mr. Bush asked about a biting description of him in '88. "But why am I like every girl's first husband? Unfair!"
I wondered if he was appalled that Mr. Clinton was reduced to purloining conservative premises.
"I'm glad about that," he faxed back. "Volunteerism, less government, China, Haiti boat people, Nafta -- I like it that our policies made some sense to those who came along after me. . . . We did leave a very strong economy in 1992, but didn't your colleagues want 'change' and wasn't I, to them, 'out of touch'?"
I was curious about the deeper meaning of those rabbit ears.
"Fun, strictly fun, and I don't have to worry now how the press corps will analyze this. I used to. But now, I am free at last -- make that relatively free at last. I don't want the Washington/NY corps charging down to Texas and Florida saying to my boys 'Defend your old man/Has he lost it these days?' Yesterday at a Maui photo op, the Silver Fox rabbit eared me -- couldn't even let me go one up without retaliation."
So what did he learn at the conference on his Presidency at Hofstra?
"I learned there are some real whacko professors scattered out around the country. Mistakes? I wish I had been a Reaganesque communicator -- but then do I?; for life is good now, it really is."
He said he had not expected so much fascination about his jump at 12,500 feet out of a plane.
"The only fear I felt was fear itself . . . but once in free fall it was heaven. I'd do it again but I'm not sure this second one wouldn't be written off by the wispy libs and oh so serious pundits as 'Look at the old guy, trying to garner more good press.' "
Asked about Bob Dole's comment that he had considered asking Mr. Bush to help pay off Newt Gingrich's debt, he said he "probably would have if asked."
Did he give any advice to Mr. Clinton at the volunteerism summit? "Are you kidding?" he asked.
As for Democrats arguing, at news of the Clintons auctioning off the Lincoln Bedroom and Air Force One, that both parties did that sort of fund-raising, Mr. Bush noted: "Everybody did not do it. Honest!"
He said he missed some things about Washington -- the White House staff and Camp David. "To some degree, I miss making decisions that matter. But, BPB and I are both very happy. I have no desire to shape history -- none. No memoirs lie ahead. Only the Scowcroft-Bush treatise, which will interest foreign policy wonks and name droppers. I think it will be OK, though I expect some critics will trash us. It will say what it was like dealing with Gorby, MT, Mitterrand, Major, Mulroney, Kaifu and Miyazawa, the guy I threw up on! It will explain why I think Saddam Hussein is a really nice guy and why I regret not 'letting sanctions work.' No, no -- wrong book."

HEADLINE: BRITAIN'S NEW TACK: LABOR'S INITIATIVE;
BRITAIN SHIFTING MONETARY POLICY TO CENTRAL BANK

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 6

 BODY:
Britain's newly elected Labor Government, signaling a historic change in economic policy, granted control over interest rates to the central bank today, a move that cheered its opposition, European leaders and financial executives, some of whom had been skeptical of Labor's resolve.
Only five days after a landslide victory in which Britain took on faith the Labor pledge to abandon its Socialist cloak and continue the free market policies of the defeated Conservative Government, Prime Minister Tony Blair, in a single masterstroke, sought to bolster his credibility and ease concerns that a trend of economic growth would be reversed. 
 By giving the Bank of England the power to set short-term interest rates, Mr. Blair instantly removed politics from interest rate decisions and went further than either of his Conservative predecessors, Margaret Thatcher or John Major, had been willing to go.
Enhanced power for the central bank had not been part of Labor's agenda and had not figured in the campaign. Whatever the political significance of the move, the change clearly gives Mr. Blair somebody to blame should the robust British economy stall.
It also gives Mr. Blair some degree of support from European leaders who want Britain to move closer to integration with Europe. While Mr. Blair has repeatedly said that it is unlikely that Britain will join with Europe in the first wave of monetary union, scheduled for 1999, today's action was clearly a nod toward the Continent. Early in the week, the Labor Government formally embraced a European Union package of worker protections that the previous British Government had opposed.
Today's move came as the Government said it would raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 6.25 percent, as a means to dampen consumer spending, rising wages and inflation.
The higher rate had been anticipated for months but had been put off during the election campaign. The surprise came in the swiftness of the decision to let the central bank set rates from here on. Announced in late morning, the decision set off rallies in the stock and bond markets in London and helped the pound strengthen against both the dollar and the German mark.
"It will insure that decisions are taken for the long-term interests of the economy and not on the basis of short-term political pressures," said Gordon Brown, the newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer who announced the decision today.
Unlike the Federal Reserve in the United States or the Bundesbank in Germany, the Bank of England has never had complete freedom to set short-term interest rates. Rather the Government controlled both budgetary and monetary policy by setting Government spending and a target rate of inflation. While the Bank of England advised the Government on how best to meet the inflation goal, the ultimate say over interest rates rested with the politicians.
Now, the Government will still set a target inflation rate, currently 2.5 percent. While some consider it a fine point, retaining that degree of political involvement means that Britain still does not meet the definition of central bank freedom envisioned by Europe's plan for monetary union and the creation of a single currency.
"This is a welcome move; while the objectives of monetary policy are a proper matter for Government, the technicalities and detail of monetary policy are for central bankers, and not for politicians," said Sir David Walker, chairman and executive director of Morgan Stanley Group (Europe) P.L.C., who is a former senior official at the Bank of England.
The actions continue a shower of initiatives intended to solidify the Labor victory last week that was based on support among business, women, minorities and the middle class.
Since the election, Mr. Blair has said he intends to bring a gradual end to Britain's estrangement from Europe and to strengthen the social safety net for the working poor and the long-term unemployed.
The Government has announced plans to revive the minimum wage, which was abolished by the Conservatives, and told the European Union this week that it would sign the so-called Social Chapter to the treaty on European unity, which provides a modest level of worker protection.
Domestically, business executives have worried that the economy, which had a 3.3 percent rise in first-quarter gross domestic product, was overheating. "My judgment is that we have inherited a situation in which, in the absence of corrective action, inflation will overshoot the Government's inflation target next year," said Mr. Brown, the Chancellor.
Labor has adopted the 2.5 percent inflationary target set by the Conservative Government; the inflation rate in March was 2.7 percent.
The swift increase in interest rates, a move normally associated with prudent fiscal policies, was cited by Labor Party spokesmen as proof that the party meant it when it said it had broken with its "tax and spend" reputation .
"It shows we will shrink from no decision that helps the long-term prosperity of Britain and its people," aides quoted Mr. Blair as saying today, his 44th birthday.
The interest rate increase prompted commercial banks to raise their base lending rates to 6.25 percent, in line with the increase, while rates on home loans rose to 7.6 percent. Since most mortgage loans here have adjustable interest rates, the rise would add about $27 to monthly payments on a mortgage of $128,000.
The decision to endorse the Social Chapter goes a long way to soothe relations with Europe. Ties with the Continent had been strained by the bickering in the Conservative Party, where many members used the prospect of European integration as a political punching bag. In addition there have been trade disagreements, such as the episode involving "mad cow" disease that resulted in severe restrictions on British beef exports to the Continent.
The main beneficiary of the decision on the Bank of England is Eddie George, a 58-year-old, chain-smoking economic technocrat who was appointed to a five-year term as governor of the bank in 1993. A nonpartisan economist who has spent his entire career at the bank, Mr. George advocates greater integration with Europe and is likely to pursue a tight monetary policy.
Under the new rules for setting interest rates, a committee of nine that comprises the bank's governor, two deputy governors, four outside members and two chosen by the governor, will set the interest rate by majority vote. Minutes of the meeting will be published six weeks after decisions are adopted. "The whole thing is very forward- looking and is positive for the U.K. markets," said Tim Fox, an economist at Standard Chartered bank.
But one prominent critic, Kenneth Clarke, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, said giving the Bank of England control over interest rates was "unwise and precipitate.," He added, "What you are going to see is, undoubtedly, tighter monetary policy than you might otherwise have."
The fiscal measures announced today were seen by many business executives as necessary to slow an economy that is growing at a rate of nearly 3 percent -- largely fed by its service sector even as manufacturing lags behind.
"Anything that keeps the economy on a keel is obviously welcome," said Martin Coleman, head banking analyst at Merrill Lynch here.
The Chancellor, Mr. Brown, told reporters that controlling inflation is seen as a crucial issue. "Price stability is an essential precondition for the Government's objective of high and sustainable growth and employment," he said.
The rise in interest rates was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry. "The move will enhance the credibility of the U.K.'s monetary policy," the group said in a statement. It strongly suggested, however, that it expected the Government to move toward a modest tax increase if further tightening was necessary -- something the Prime Minister has vowed not to do. The business group wants the Labor Government to avoid further increases in interest rates, which would tend to bolster the already-strong pound and make British exports more costly.

Bond Prices Drop Slightly For 2d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were slightly lower for a second day yesterday, as the market had difficulty absorbing the first of two legs of the Government's quarterly debt refunding this week.
Weakness in the dollar has also undermined prices. A strong dollar makes investments denominated in the United States currency, like Treasury securities, more attractive to foreign investors because of the potential gains in currency translation. 
 The decline in bond prices came despite weaker-than-expected reports on weekly retail sales and on factory orders, which normally would be bullish indicators for the bond market.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to 96 26/32, yesterday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, was 6.88 percent, unchanged from Monday and Friday.
Analysts had expected strong demand for the new three-year securities, figuring that investors were still optimistic after last week's rally in the bond market.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said another reason for the expected strong demand was the fact that the size of the refunding was significantly less than the February total.
But instead of coming in strong, demand was surprisingly slack.
"The unexpectedly weak or lethargic auction left a sour taste in many investors' minds," Mr. Chan said.
The bid-to-cover ratio, or the total amount of bids made versus the total amount of securities available, was 2.08 to 1, the lowest of the last four quarterly auctions and lower than the 2.63-to-1 average from August 1988 through now.
The average yield for the new three-year note was 6.438 percent, up from 5.997 percent at the last refunding, but lower than the 6.442 percent some traders expected. The Government plans to sell $12 billion of 10-year notes today, and in when-issued trading yesterday, they were offered at a price to yield 6.66 percent.
Mr. Chan said investors failed to cheer yesterday's slightly weaker-than-expected economic reports primarily because "much of the caviar had already been consumed during the past several days, when yields moved significantly lower."
In general, signs of economic weakening are favorable for the bond market because they lessen concerns about inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
"We truly needed an outsized decline in factory orders to capture the attention of the remaining buyers," Mr. Chan said.
Mr. Chan said that the market was weighed down after comments from Gail Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board, were reported; in a speech at the National Association of Purchasing Management convention she said that an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve on May 20 was all but guaranteed.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Average Price	99.831	Average Yield	6.438%	Low Price	99.801	High Yield	6.449%	High Price	99.852	Low Yield	6.430%	Accepted at low price	13%	Total applied for	$35,363,531	Accepted	$17,000,851	Noncompetitive	$967,000	Interest set at	6 3/8%

HEADLINE: Not One of Your Big Jump-Starts;
G.M. Is Trying to Make a Go Of Its Electric Car

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., May 6

 BODY:
It has been five months since General Motors introduced the country's first mass-produced electric vehicle in Southern California and Arizona, and demand is just about what the company said it would be: lackluster at best.
The world's biggest auto maker has found just 176 takers for its New Age $34,000 two-seater, known as the EV1. Hoping to stir up consumer interest, it cut monthly lease payments by $100, or 25 percent, last Friday for the zippy little coupe, to a range of $399 to $549. But for that, a car shopper could get a sporty Honda Prelude. 
 For years car makers, including General Motors, tenaciously fought California's mandate that they build zero-emission vehicles, warning that battery technology was not up to snuff and that there was only a tiny market for something as costly and inconvenient as an electric car. The EV1, for example, not only runs out of power every 70 to 90 miles but also requires an hour or two to be recharged.
So is G.M. simply fulfilling its unenthusiastic prophecy?
In its view, quite the contrary. Rather, the company is carefully managing the initial leasing of EV1's -- the cars are not available for purchase -- to make sure the first batch of customers like what they get. The result has been that many EV1 drivers tend to be electric car enthusiasts who have been wanting for such a vehicle for years.
G.M.'s first step is to screen potential EV1 drivers, sending electricians to their homes to figure out how to wire up a recharger (at an extra $1,000), and warning of the dangers of being stranded in the mountains. To make sure they get the point, it does free calculations of would-be customers' commuting routes and provides a map of public charging stations, which remain sparse. For good measure, it points out that EV1 drivers can expect an endless stream of curbside gawk.
G.M. talks roughly 80 percent of applicants out of taking possession of an EV1. But those who make the grade -- mostly well-to-do males -- get the royal treatment. The 25 Saturn dealerships marketing the EV1 in metropolitan Los Angeles, San Diego, Tucson and Phoenix offer customer-pleasing extras more common to luxury cars, like life-of-lease repair warranties and 24-hour roadside aid. And they make monthly calls to buyers, similar to protective parents checking on a college freshman.
By hooking a small group of technology-minded devotees and pampering them at every step, General Motors not only gets good press and creates a mystique about the EV1, it also buys time to iron out kinks and find ways to broaden the vehicle's appeal, notably with new battery technology that will power it for longer distances.
"We passionately believe the enthusiasm of the initial owners is crucial to the success of the vehicle and the development of the market," said J. Joseph Kennedy, vice president for sales at Saturn.
And generally, buyers are singing the praises of the EV1.
"Everywhere you look on this car, there is technology that's extraordinary," said Marvin V. Rush, 43, of Los Angeles, a cinematographer for the "Star Trek" television series. He cited the EV1's system for partly recharging its batteries by capturing energy created by braking, actually a new use of an old technology.
"You can't argue that's not kind of neat," agreed Jeff Church, of San Dimas, Calif., a commercial pilot who was considering leasing an EV1 but was waiting for its price to fall. Mr. Church, who drives a Chevy Suburban, especially likes the EVI's powerful acceleration.
The EV1, developed at a cost of $350 million to satisfy California's push for less air pollution, also appeals to environmentalists and energy conservationists. Originally, California required that 2 percent of 1998 model cars sold in the state produce zero emissions; last year it backed off, though it still mandates 10 percent zero emissions by 2003.
So far, two other states, New York and Massachusetts, have said they want to require electric vehicles, with New York following California's original mandate. Last June, General Motors began working with Boston Edison to start developing charging stations to support electric vehicles in Massachusetts.
"The reason I like this car is I'm an eco-freak," said Rick Ostrov, a salesman at a dealership that carries EV1's here in Santa Ana. He drives a demonstration vehicle. "It's like a little rocket ship from the 21st century," he said. Even so, he added, the cars' limited range stops a sizable percentage of like-minded thinkers.
For all the plaudits, many doubts remain about the EV1. Some critics question the need for electric cars, arguing they will never be much more than souped-up golf carts and that cleaner oil-powered cars could be developed at half the cost.
John G. Rettie, editor of a monthly report on the California car market by J. D. Power Associates, an auto-research company in Westlake Village, Calif., said the market for electric cars was bound to remain minuscule as long as cheap gasoline was plentiful to power the gas-guzzlers now in vogue. Indeed, most people who lease the EV1 already own two or three gasoline-powered cars. And, Mr. Rettie added, "Southern California is one of the worst areas for an electric car because people drive distances that are so great."
Not surprisingly, interests with a stake in the status quo have joined in the attack. Anita Mangels, executive director of Californians Against Hidden Taxes, of Laguna Beach, which is financed by the oil industry, scorns the EV1 as a toy for the rich. "The cars are only being sold to high-earners," Ms. Mangels said. 'It's a product they wouldn't buy if they weren't subsidized." She estimated that lessees got an average subsidy of $7,500, including Federal and state tax credits, reductions in vehicle license fees and public spending for recharging stations.
And even with sluggish demand for electric cars, the EV1 will soon face formidable competition. The Honda Motor Company's electric version of a compact mini-van will be on the road this month, and the Toyota Motor Corporation's electric sport utility vehicle is scheduled to be introduced in the fall. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are farther behind, though Ford announced plans last month to build a prototype electric car that gets its power from a fuel cell rather than the old-fashioned lead-acid batteries that power the EV1.
There is also skepticism about G.M.'s long-term commitment. The auto maker halted its development effort once before, during a board room revolt in 1992. Most of the big car makers, reluctant to step up to California's zero-emission mandates, worked with lobbyists for the oil industry to push back the requirements.
For all the doubts, though, G.M. really seems determined. Expansion is being considered, Harry J. Pearce, the company's vice chairman, said through a spokesman, who would not say where. In addition to New York and Massachusetts, the areas that are most likely to be considered include several Southern states with mild temperatures and flat terrains that are less taxing on batteries.
Moreover, G.M. is busily perfecting and promoting its futuristic four-wheeler. Advanced batteries, which would nearly double the EV1's range to 150 miles for each charge, are to be introduced as early as this fall, and current drivers can have their vehicles retrofitted for a fee. After an introductory TV campaign featuring the EV1 being welcomed by animated home appliances, new commercials are being prepared for broadcasting in parts of the Southwest by the summer.
Whether G.M. is serious about the electric car or just trying to placate regulators, Mr. Rettie of J. D. Power says it stands to reap considerable benefits from its efforts. "It's a showroom stopper; its like a Corvette," he said. Besides winning bragging rights for being the first with an electric car, it should gain engineering expertise that will result in improvements in other cars, he said.
G.M. professes nonchalance about the slow sales. "We all knew going in that we were not going to see high volumes in this vehicle," said Mr. Pearce, the vice chairman. And as the auto maker steps up its marketing, others are joining to help. Some EV1 lovers recently staged an old-fashioned road rally, a freeway caravan across Ventura County in Southern California to show their gratitude to Price/Costco Inc., a chain of warehouse stores that installed battery-recharging stations at its outlets in the cities of Oxnard and Simi Valley. The retailer sees economic opportunity in catering to EV1 drivers.
Moreover, utilities are seeking to quell consumer concerns over the scarcity of charging stations. For $1,000, they already wire drivers' homes with a 220-volt outlet that repowers the cars' batteries in three hours.
Recharging stations that look like gasoline pumps are going up outside restaurants and malls, places where people linger for the 60 minutes needed for an 80 percent refill. So far, there are just 47 stations in California and 22 in Arizona, most at Saturn dealerships and utility offices. Local smog regulators are supposed to help pay for building another 150 sites in California by the end of the year. And last week, G.M. agreed to underwrite an additional 50 sites in Southern California the next two months.
For the first few years, at least, public chargers will not be metered and recharges will be free, said Edward Kjaer, director of marketing and sales for Edison EV, a unit of Edison International, operator of Southern California Edison. One potential customer calculated that a daily charge of the EV1 at home would cost him $16 a month compared with $60 a month he spends on gasoline.
David L. Hardin, an executive at Hawthorne Savings in Los Angeles, installed a recharging station at the the savings institution's office as a marketing device. "I'm more of a capitalist than an environmentalist," he said. "It's a great attention getter."
Even at low volume, the EV1 is proof California's mandate works, according to Jerry A. Martin, a spokesman for the state's Air Resources Board in Sacramento. "We're pleased with the introduction," he said. "It's two years earlier than we required." Regulators estimate that auto makers can make 14,000 electric cars a year. G.M. declines to release capacity figures for its EV1 plant in Lansing, Mich., where 100 workers assemble nothing else.
Like aficionados of other cars, EV1 fans started a club that had its first meeting at an Earth Day event in Torrance, south of Los Angeles, on April 19. "Twenty years from now, when we're all breathing cleaner air, I can say I had a hand in it," said Mr. Rush, the cinematographer, one of 18 people who attended.
Some drivers contend the EV1 fails to attain the 70 to 90 miles a charge cited by General Motors. But Eric J. Luebben, an engineer from Lake Forest, Calif., says the complaint is usually made by people with a lead foot. "You can easily achieve that mileage," he said. "You just can't jump on the throttle."
Mr. Luebben estimated he will spend $489 to power his EV1 for three years, compared with $7,592 he would have to pay for gasoline for his 13-mile-a-gallon Chevy truck. For maximum freeway mileage, he has determined that the wake of a pickup truck is the best spot to capitalize on the EV1's aerodynamic design. "You're going 65 with the energy of 45," he boasted.

Chart: "Do You Qualify?"
Anxious to create a cadre of happy drivers for its new EV1 electric car, General Motors is rejecting 80 percent of the customers who apply for leases. Here are some of the considerations:
 
FAVORABLE CHARACTERISTICS
--prefers a two-seater.
--owns another car and desires a second commuter car for errands and city driving.
--owns a home with a wired garage.
--able to pay $399 to $549 a month.
 
UNFAVORABLE CHARACTERISTICS
--lives in a condo complex with an inflexible homeowners association.

HEADLINE: BRITAIN'S NEW TACK: A GLOBAL TREND;
Divorcing Central Banks and Politics: Independence Helps in Inflation Fight

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
In granting more independence to the Bank of England, the new British Government is a late entrant in a trend that has seen nations give increasing autonomy to their central banks, distancing monetary policy from direct political control. The practice has spread across the globe in response to demands from investors in financial markets for proof that governments will remain committed to inflation-fighting.
Japan, whose central bank long operated under the direct authority of the finance ministry, is enacting legislation to give its Bank of Japan more autonomy, though not complete independence. France has removed its central bank from direct government control in recent years. Even developing nations like Chile and smaller countries like New Zealand that were once plagued with inflation have set up independent central banks as they battle to bring upward price spirals under control and stabilize their economies. 
 "It's all about credibility," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington. "There are a lot of studies that show that independence of central banks correlates very closely with achieving price stability."
The Bundesbank in Germany is generally considered the most independent of all central banks, and the model for nations seeking to insulate monetary policy from politics. The Federal Reserve also ranks high, although unlike the Bundesbank, which by law is focused solely on price stability, the Fed's mandate extends to supporting full employment as well.
New Zealand has won considerable attention for setting up an independent central bank where the governor is bound through a public contract with the Government to meet specified inflation goals, an innovation that has largely succeeded.
The trend toward independence is rapidly eroding the practice, common only a few years ago in nearly all nations except the United States and Germany, of regarding monetary policy as the responsibility and right of the government of the day. And it is accelerating at a time when global investors are also insisting on fiscal austerity, effectively stripping governments of their other traditional economic tool, using deficit spending to stimulate expansion.
The impetus for the change comes in part from a recognition that allowing politicians to set interest rates can yield bad policy, undermining efforts to keep inflation under control by avoiding the short-term pain that higher interest rates can cause. It also stems from a growing consensus among experts that low inflation is a precondition to achieving low unemployment and not necessarily an obstacle to that goal.
In the "imperfect world in which most central bankers ply their trade, political systems tend to behave myopically, favoring inflationary policies with short-run benefits and discounting excessively their long-run costs," Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, wrote in an article several months ago. "An independent central bank, given responsibility for price stability, can overcome this inflationary bias."
In Europe, the move toward central bank independence is being speeded by plans for monetary union among members of the European Union. The nations that would enter a monetary union, which encompasses a single currency and a single monetary policy to be set by a European Central Bank, are loosening government control of their central banks -- some faster than others.
France, which along with Germany would be at the core of a single currency, has severed many of the ties between the Government and the Bank of France, although economists said the bank had yet to develop a completely independent culture. Italy has moved more slowly.
The planned European Central Bank, scheduled to begin operation in 1999, will perform its duties with no direct control from any of the member nations. While the central bankers would be appointed by political leaders, the degree of power that would be ceded to the institution is so great that there are questions about whether citizens will ultimately get cold feet and postpone the move.
As they grant more independence to their central banks, more nations are setting explicit inflation targets, or encouraging monetary policy makers to do so. Canada, Sweden and Britain as well as New Zealand now set annual goals and expect monetary policy to be adjusted to keep inflation within those bounds. In Britain, for example, the current goal is 2.5 percent inflation.
"The setting of explicit goals promotes accountability, making it more likely that the central bank will come close to the target," Mr. Fischer said. "Accountability and the need to explain deviations from targets should promote transparency, allowing the public to understand the basis for monetary policy decisions and thus to form more accurate expectations."

HEADLINE: Brazil Awards Big Mining Stake To Group Bidding $3.13 Billion

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, May 6

 BODY:
The on-again, off-again privatization of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the Brazilian state-owned mining giant, proceeded today, with a group financed by the Nationsbank Corporation emerging as the winning bidder.
Nationsbank provided a $1.1 billion loan for the purchase, which was led by the Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional. The group is taking a 41.73 percent stake in the company for 3.34 billion reals, or $3.13 billion. 
 But the privatization -- the largest sale of a state asset in Latin America -- was completed only after the Government managed to throw out a last-minute injunction that had been granted today at the request of the mining company's workers. The auction proceeded late this afternoon and was completed in four minutes.
"No one believed in our proposal, but we were able to pull it together," said Benjamin Steinbruch, the chairman of Siderurgica Nacional. That company, Brazil's largest steelmaker, was itself sold by the Government to private investors in 1992.
Vale do Rio Doce, or C.V.R.D., was sold at a 20 percent premium above the minimum price of 2.782 billion reals.
"We're pleasantly surprised by the premium that was paid," the Planning Minister, Antonio Kandir, said.
The court order that the Government managed to overturn was the latest in an avalanche of legal obstacles erected by opponents to the sale, who argued that Brazil was selling off a piece of its natural wealth for a pittance. C.V.R.D. is the world's largest exporter of iron ore and the largest gold producer in Latin America.
Today's injunction actually interrupted the bidding after it began, and delayed its completion for several hours.
And the legal wrangling over the auction may yet continue. Brazil's highest appeals court raised doubts about the auction after its completion, and scheduled a session to discuss a lawsuit filed by a legal professor challenging the process.
The completion of the auction was greeted by a round of applause and the singing of the Brazilian national anthem on the floor of the stock exchange here, while the sale's opponents protested outside.
Last week, hundreds of people demonstrated nationwide in a bid to derail the sale of C.V.R.D., a company that spearheaded development of a large swath of the Amazon and helped put Brazil on the map of industrialized nations.
The winning bid beat out one by a group led by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and S.A. Industrias Votorantim, the largest industrial group in Brazil.
Siderurgica Nacional bought the largest block of shares, a 16.3 percent stake, for 1.3 billion reals. In addition to providing the financing, Nationsbank also purchased a 5 percent stake in C.V.R.D. for 400 million reals, through a company called Sweet River Investments Ltd. Vale do Rio Doce translates to "Valley of the Sweet River."
The investment is a big step for Nationsbank, whose Latin American operations are dwarfed by those of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the BankBoston Corporation, Citicorp and other foreign banks.

HEADLINE: WELFARE CRUCIBLE -- A special report.;
Cutting Welfare Rolls but Raising Questions

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
The welfare rolls are crashing through the floor here.
Caseloads have shrunk nearly 25 percent in the last year alone, and each month another 1,800 people leave the system. No major city has ever seen such startling declines, though many are now looking here with an envious eye and the hope of imitation. 
 But as Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin boasts of "our amazing success," the question is what has happened to the throngs of low-income women and children leaving the rolls.
Advocates for the poor, here and across the country, are quick to note that homelessness has been rising, and shelters overflowing, since the state's strict new work rules took hold. But those falling into such utter destitution represent only a small percentage of the 10,000 families leaving the rolls.
Many more seem to be working, in jobs they recently landed or secretly held in the past. Others, weary of the system's new hassles, have moved in with friends or family, or left the state.
Critics argue that the new system focuses more on penalizing the poor than on helping them. And state officials acknowledge that foul-ups in the complex new system have caused thousands of families to temporarily lose their benefits, often through no fault of their own.
The data are sketchy at best, and no one knows how many of Milwaukee's welfare poor have moved toward economic betterment, and how many have suffered an erosion in living standards that were already alarmingly low.
Still, the mere absence of obvious calamity is being seen in some quarters as a reason for cautious optimism -- a first, tentative suggestion that as welfare restrictions sweep the cities, many poor families will find ways to adapt.
"It's too early to declare victory, but the initial outcome is encouraging," said Mayor John O. Norquist, a Democrat who occupies a middle ground between Mr. Thompson, the Republican Governor who designed the new system, and local critics who have gone as far as calling it "genocide."
"Most people have underestimated the abilities of welfare recipients to work and care for their families," Mr. Norquist said.
Milwaukee is capturing unusual attention because it is the first city to enforce the kind of strict rules envisioned by the landmark Federal welfare law that President Clinton signed last August. Milwaukee's experiment had begun in March 1996, when the state imposed three new programs.
One tries to divert new applicants from the rolls. A second requires welfare recipients to work 35 hours a week for their benefits. The third aims to change the behavior of bureaucrats, not poor people, by privatizing many job-placement services and rewarding the most successful agencies.
The welfare rolls, which were already declining, suddenly went into a free fall. Statewide, Wisconsin's rolls have dropped nearly 60 percent from their peak a decade ago, and nearly half of the state's counties have cut their rolls by an astonishing 80 percent or more.
But the caseload reductions are most surprising in Milwaukee, the nation's 17th-largest city. With 617,044 residents, Milwaukee grapples with the concentrated poverty that bedevils other urban cores. A full 60 percent of the state's welfare recipients reside within the city limits, and their experiences have run the gamut.
Marla Spencer overcame her fear of rejection and landed her first job in a decade, folding sheets in a commercial laundry for $5.25 an hour. "My whole family's happy," she said, "and I'm the happiest of them all."
Toni Rogers landed in the state work program, quarreled with her boss and lost her benefits and her apartment. "She tried to talk to me like I was a dog or something -- dehumanize me and stuff," she said one night in a homeless shelter over a plate of cold spaghetti.
Angela Engel bounced between work and welfare, and found neither a happy solution. Her last job, at a press that prints adult magazines, left her watching color close-ups ripple down a conveyer belt all day. "It was nasty," she said.
But after returning to welfare, Ms. Engel found herself back on an assembly line, working for her benefits and being pushed to leave the rolls. "That's what they're pressuring you to do -- take anything, just to stay out of the system," she said.
Ms. Engel's analysis is apt. Wisconsin's drive to reduce its rolls is in part a preparation for an even bolder experiment. In September, it will become the first state to abolish cash assistance altogether and replace it with a more costly system of subsidized jobs for the needy. To keep that program affordable, the state needs to keep the number of participants low.
In the run-up, Milwaukee is framing the most important question in welfare policy: Can work really work?

The Rules
Hassles Nudge Many Off Aid
Inside the welfare office, a woman in a green power suit is pacing the floor. "Ladies and gentlemen, the state has never given you enough to support your family," she says. "It's sad, but the world looks at people on welfare as being lazy, sitting home having a bunch of kids."
She pauses, and then she gets personal. "I've been there," she says.
No one in Milwaukee comes onto the rolls without enduring a session like this, an anti-welfare lecture from a social worker with his or her own hardscrabble past. After the lecture, applicants must spend 60 hours searching for a job before receiving aid.
Since last year's start of the program, which is called Self-Sufficiency First, quarterly case openings have run between 7 percent and 31 percent lower than those of the previous year.
Privatization has played a large role. Fearing that career social workers would take a benign view of public aid, the state hired an outside company to run the program. The company, in turn, sought caseworkers for whom self-reliance was a matter of autobiography.
Becky Green, the upbeat woman in the power suit, tells her clients she became a single mother at the age of 17. Then she rejected welfare and worked everywhere from a McDonald's restaurant to a welding shop in order to get ahead. "We're telling them their destiny is their own," she said.
But while Ms. Green is seeking philosophical converts, there may be a simpler explanation for the program's effectiveness: the hassle factor. "A lot of people just say, 'The heck with it, I'll find my own job,"' said Jason Turner, the former state official who designed the program, and who recently left to start the Center for Self-Sufficiency in Milwaukee, a consulting business.
Once families get on the rolls, the hassles increase. About 12,000 of the city's 26,000 welfare families are now enrolled in the work program, called "Pay for Performance." In addition to spending 20 hours a week at a work assignment, they must spend 10 hours looking for a permanent job, and attend five hours of meetings on job-search techniques. For every hour they miss, their welfare checks are reduced by $4.25.
While other cities have run work programs for welfare mothers, none is as large or as strictly enforced. In other programs, a mother who fails to comply typically loses about a third of her grant. In Milwaukee, those who do not work lose their entire cash benefit, which is $517 a month for a family of three.
At its best, the work program produces stories like that of Ms. Spencer, a 37-year-old mother of two who had spent 19 years on welfare before getting the laundry job. She held her last job a decade ago, a two-month stint as a kitchen aide at a Chi-Chi's restaurant. Asked why she had not sought work since, Ms. Spencer, who has a 10th-grade education, called herself "lazy." But soon another explanation emerged: fear of rejection. "They say they're going to call you back but they never do," she said.
Last summer she was notified that if she did not report for a work assignment, she would lose her check. A private case management agency, hired by the state, assigned Ms. Spencer to spend 20 hours a week working for Goodwill Industries. Goodwill put her in the vast laundry it runs as a nonprofit business to train workers and provide jobs.
She spent four hours a day loading hotel sheets into washing machines the size of ballistic missiles. "I was happy because it gave me something to do besides sitting at home every day," she said.
Ms. Spencer compiled a perfect attendance record, and when a permanent job opened five months later, she was hired at $5.25 an hour. Taking a break from the factory floor, she told the story as if she still could not believe her good fortune. "Now my son can tell his friends at school that his mother works," she said.
But a more jaded view comes from Ms. Engel, who can be seen on the Goodwill floor in a favorite black T-shirt that warns, "I'm Gonna Kill Someone." At 32, she has tended bar, worked factory floors and survived a relationship with a man who beat her so badly that she still has a bald spot on the back of her head.
She was earning what she considered good money, $7.47 an hour, printing the adult magazines. But she quit after being put on the night shift, worrying that she would not be able to see her four children. "I figured I had them, I'm going to raise them," she said.
After years of hard jobs and hard living, Ms. Engel regards the work program as a waste of time. She sounded particularly annoyed at her case manager, who told her to wear high heels and a dress for an interview at a factory. "I'm like, 'Listen, little sister,' " she said, ' "I'm 10 years older than you. Don't tell me what to do.' "
Still, Ms. Engel concedes the rules are likely to have their intended effect, of reducing her stay on the rolls. "I can find something better out there," she said.
Thousands of others have come to the same conclusion. Skeptics say that since those who remain on the rolls are more disadvantaged, they will prove much more challenging to place. But so far the decline shows no sign of abating.
"The Milwaukee experience shows that it's far easier to reduce welfare dependency than anyone imagined," said Robert Rector, a welfare analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, a Washington research group. "There's no two-year time limit, there's no kicking people in the street. All there is, is a simple work requirement."

The Numbers
Many Disappear From Radar Screen
But no one knows where the recipients have gone. "The state doesn't want to know," said John Pawasarat, the director of the Employment and Training Institute at the University of Milwaukee at Wisconsin. "The goal is caseload reduction, period."
Mr. Pawasarat has sought some statistical clues, but by his own description they leave many questions unanswered. Examining 8,500 recently closed cases, he found follow-up information on 69 percent. They involved families still in the public aid system -- no longer receiving cash but still needy enough to be getting food stamps or medical subsidies.
The other 31 percent could have suffered any mix of fates. They might have made so much money they no longer qualified. They might have left the state. They might have moved in with relatives or become so defeated that they totally fell out of the system.
Of those for whom records were available, 68 percent were working. But, Mr. Pawasarat said, "My guess is that most of those cases were already working" -- legally or illegally -- even when they were on welfare.
Another 18 percent for whom records were available reported no income at all, other than food stamps or medical aid. But this finding, too, is ambivalent: Such women could be destitute, relying on the underground economy or living comfortably with relatives or boyfriends. The remainder of those in Mr. Pawasarat's sample had other forms of unearned income, like child support or disability benefits. Mr. Pawasarat is among the many people who have criticized the state for refusing to collect better data. But Governor Thompson said he did not need a study to know the program works. "We know the vast majority of them have jobs and are working, which is how it ought to be," he said. "They're doing better and they like it."
Asked for the basis of his assessment, Mr. Thompson acknowledged it was unscientific. "It's anecdotal evidence," he said.

The Chaos
System Crushed Under Caseload
So far, the Milwaukee experiment has proceeded under conditions that are nearly ideal. The city's economy is strong, with an unemployment rate of just 5.7 percent, low for an urban core. And the state invested an additional $10 million last year in day care and case managers for those in the work program, which was more than offset by nearly $30 million in caseload reductions.
Yet despite considerable investment, the system has been rife with bureaucratic errors, creating a series of ordeals for those who remain on the rolls. An average of 4,200 families a month lost income for rule infractions last year -- or one of every three families in the work program. While that alone represents a vast loss of benefits, an average of 36 percent of the penalties were later found to have been improperly applied. That means about 1,500 Milwaukee families a month were penalized even when following the rules. While the lost income was typically restored, the costs of waiting and worrying can run high, especially among poor families whose budgets leave little room for error.
Ms. Spencer, the model Goodwill worker, was sanctioned twice, though she had never missed a day of work. "One day they'll tell you you're getting a full grant," she said. "Then the next day they tell you you're sanctioned. I said, 'What is that?' "
In a Goodwill conference room, her complaint was echoed by all three of the other model workers chosen to talk to a reporter. "I was broke at Christmas," said Angela Marney, who lost her check in December after her case manager failed to punch her hours into the computer. "A lot of them ain't paying attention."
The problem has been particularly common for those who combine small amounts of welfare with private, part-time jobs. "We don't think that's anybody's idea of welfare reform -- punishing working people," said Pat DeLessio, a Legal Services lawyer who has handled many appeals.
Another group caught in the muddle are the disabled, and those with disabled children, who are often subject to conflicting interpretations of whether they can work. Of Glenda Johnson's three young children, one has cerebral palsy and another is being tested for cystic fibrosis. She sends them to physical therapy twice a week and applies medicine from a nebulizer four times a day.
After being told last summer to report for a work assignment, Ms. Johnson gave her caseworker a letter from her doctor. "It is important for their health and development that Glenda Johnson be at home for the care of her children," he wrote. "She should not be employed outside the home."
But her caseworker disagreed, and Ms. Johnson lost her benefits. They were reinstated a month later, when no one from the state appeared at her appeal hearing. Then early this year, Ms. Johnson received another notice, threatening to revoke her check unless she begins working 35 hours a week.
"I think it's unjust, but who am I?" she said. "I'm just a welfare recipient."
Once an error is made, it can prove daunting to correct. With average caseloads of about 370, the welfare eligibility workers are literally too busy to answer the phone. As a test, social workers at Community Advocates, a nonprofit group that works with low-income families, recently called 100 eligibility workers. After waiting a week, they had reached only 26 percent. "The system cannot handle the new mandates," said Ramon Wagner, the organization's director.
Governor Thompson acknowledges the problems. "Any time you turn a system around as much as we have you're going to make some mistakes," he said. "We don't like it, but there's nothing we can do about it."
But the state designed the system in a way that invited such errors. The issuance of checks became the last step in a cumbersome computer chain. Work records had to travel from on-site supervisors, to private case managers, to county eligibility workers. If any link was broken -- if a caseworker, say, was late in logging in records -- the computer system would assume the recipient had failed to work and withhold that month's benefits. The system was designed that way to emphasize the seriousness of the work requirement: the burden was on the recipients to prove they worked, not on the state to prove they had not.
But Mr. Turner, the former official, said the state reversed itself in March and "moved back to a mechanism where, when nothing is entered, they'll get a full check." He said the move was partly driven by negative publicity. "It just wasn't worth having the advocates running around with a case of someone not getting their check," he said.

The Casualties
Program Takes A Human Toll
Twenty blocks west of Milwaukee's downtown, a neon cross crowns a cavernous building where business is unusually brisk. "Joy House" is the largest of the city's homeless shelters. And in recent months it has drawn reporters from as far as Japan looking for those who have fallen through the cracks.
There's no doubt that homelessness has risen since the new laws took effect. The city's shelters were overflowing all winter, and churches took turns opening their doors to accommodate those without beds. The question is whether to consider the rise large or small in light of the vast changes under way.
Joe Volk, chairman of the Milwaukee Shelter Task Force, estimates that the number of homeless families rose by about 25 percent this past winter, compared with the previous year. On a given winter night, he said, that meant about 41 additional families were homeless. By the spring, Mr. Volk said, that number had declined to about 26 families a night.
Since such numbers represent a tiny percentage of the 10,000 families who have left the rolls, some analysts find the statistics reassuring. "That's a lot of caseload reduction without finding very many horror stories," said Mr. Rector, the Heritage Foundation analyst.
But Mr. Volk said that the single-night numbers might underestimate the problem: Over the course of a year, hundreds of additional families may find themselves homeless. What is more, he said, the numbers may continue to rise. "People don't become homeless overnight," he said. "They typically go through a period of staying with family and friends. I don't think we've seen the full effects yet."
Other statistics offer a mixed picture of the new law's effect on the most vulnerable. Mr. Wagner, the director of Community Advocates, said he expected sharper rises in reports of child abuse and neglect. While the reports rose 12 percent in 1996, to 10,168, they are still 4 percent below the level set in 1994.
"We thought there'd be a more dramatic impact," Mr. Wagner said, "that if a couple thousand families lost all their incomes, you'd really see the child welfare numbers shoot up. We haven't seen that."
But at the Hunger Task Force of Milwaukee, officials are troubled by the increased requests for food assistance. After remaining stable for several years, the number of people visiting food pantries rose 14 percent in 1996, to 42,000 a month. And the number of people receiving hot meals rose 20 percent.
"Right now we're having a pretty strong economy, and we're seeing hunger increase," said Rene Scherck-Meyer, a policy analyst at the task force. "Our concern is what will happen if there's a downturn."
She added that some of the increase could have come from other cuts, including the elimination in 1995 of a state welfare program for single adults.
As for the increase in homelessness, Mr. Rector, the Heritage Foundation analyst, argues that it is not necessarily a bad result. Many of the women arriving in shelters have drug problems that kept them from work. "If they wind up in a shelter, that's a good thing," Mr. Rector said, "because now they're going to have to start dealing with their problems. The previous welfare system would have let them sit there for five years."
That suggestion draws an angry response from Sherrie Kay, the director of Hope House, a shelter on the city's south side. "It's not going to cause you to get alcohol and drug treatment if there is no alcohol and drug treatment," she said. "Eviction is not part of any drug treatment program that I know of."
Opinions can be just as varied among the shelter residents themselves. Loretta Wright said she knew she would lose her benefits when she abandoned her assignment at a nursing home. But she was depressed because her brother had been murdered and her mother was terminally ill. Plus, she said, "I was really jacked up" on drugs.
She called her stay at Joy House with her two young sons a step in the right direction. "I'm here because I need to be here," she said. And she praised the new welfare law "because it wakes people up."
But others just get more beaten down. Amber Peck also realized she was forfeiting her check when she ignored her work notice last fall. But after years of depression and intermittent bouts of drug abuse, she could not bring herself to join the program. "I stay depressed all the time," she said.
After losing her check, Ms. Peck looked for a job and a cheaper apartment. Finding neither, she left her two teen-age children with a friend, and moved into Hope House. But she lost her spot there this winter after staying out all night with friends.
By the time a late winter snow storm hit, she was reduced to roaming the city with a shopping bag and sleeping on a church floor, either unwilling or unable to change. "It's my fault," she said, looking much older than her 47 years and sounding indescribably sad. "I knew they were going to do this."

HEADLINE: Military Ends Conflict Of Career and Religion

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SHIPROCK, N.M.

 BODY:
As a Navajo, Staff Sgt. Shawn Arnold always had trouble reconciling his Marine Corps career with his religion, whose ancient rituals clashed with military anti-drug policy.
Twice, he beat back courts-martial attempts over his use of peyote, a cactus with hallucinogenic properties that is central to worship in the Native American Church, which has four branches. 
 "You put on the uniform, you look at the American flag," said Sergeant Arnold, a member of the Native American Church of Navajoland, "but you don't really feel you are free because you can't practice your own religion."
But now, less than a century after Army soldiers helped Christian missionaries in an effort to stamp out Indian religions, the Pentagon is drawing up rules to allow American Indian soldiers to consume peyote, which contains the psychedelic drug mescaline, at religious ceremonies.
The Native American Church counts its total membership at 250,000 people in 50 tribes, or at least 1 of 10 Indians. Americans familiar with the counterculture of the 1960's and 70's may recall when hippies scoured the peyote gardens of southern Texas for buttons of "native LSD" to get high.
Relgious use of peyote is far different, say experts on Indian religion and military chaplains. "Our real opposition has been lack of understanding," said Frank Dayish Jr., president of the Native American Church of North America, who lives on this Navajo reservation. "I have grown up with peyote. Hallucinations, visions -- I have never experienced that."
Somewhat analogous to communion wine in Christian tradition, peyote is called "the sacrament" by Native American churchgoers. Drawing on pan-Indian traditions of the Plains, the ceremonies take place in teepees, where a fire is kept burning and drumming and chanting last through the night. As the Road Man, or leader, takes followers down the Peyote Road, the cactus buttons are sliced into pieces and eaten, or ingested as a tea. Though large amounts can induce visions or hallucinations, participants say the amounts taken are so small that the peyote only brings on a spiritual, introspective mood that puts them closer to God.
Such rituals go back 10,000 years, but American law has taken time to recognize their validity. After decades of being caught between laws protecting freedom of religion and those prosecuting illegal drugs, Indians who use peyote in religious ceremonies were given full protection by Congress in 1994, through amendments to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978.
Capt. Mel Ferguson of the Navy, executive director of the Armed Forces Chaplain's Board, who drew up the rules to comply with the 1994 legislation, said: "The Department of Defense does not make theological judgments on what is sacramental and what is not. D.O.D. is simply incorporating the laws of the land."
Under the new military guidelines, which were issued on April 27, peyote use is restricted to enrolled tribal members who are also members of a Native American Church. Peyote may not be brought on military vehicles, planes, vessels or bases. The celebrant must stop using peyote at least 24 hours before returning to active duty. Returning soldiers must notify their commanders that they have taken peyote. In some cases, they may have to notify commanders beforehand. The rules are expected to become final by July.
They will affect only a tiny fraction of the 1.4 million men and women in the armed forces. Of the 9,262 troops who are Indian, as few as 5 percent may be members of the Native American Church.
A legacy of misunderstanding and prejudice by the military may keep peyote use by Indians in the armed services underground for years to come, church members predicted. Last December, church members gathered in the Dayish family's ceremonial hogan here to relate their experiences to military chaplains.
Military veterans recalled hostile commanders who ridiculed their religious practices, denied promotions and blocked career paths that required high security clearances. Navajo parents complained that military recruiters still tell their children that they cannot enlist if they take peyote.
"I have been to many ceremonies for young people going into the service," said Harry Walters, a professor of tribal culture and religion at Navajo Community College, in Tsaile, Ariz., "and because it can be traced, they sit through the prayer service without taking peyote. It would be like a doctor treating you without giving you any medicine."
Robert Peregoy, a lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund, who helped negotiate the new rules with the Pentagon, said there were widespread misconceptions about the cactus. He said, "Medical journals show that peyote is not harmful, not habit-forming and does not cause flashbacks."
Support for the new law also comes from the Drug Enforcement Administration. In an early time of peyote controversy, from 1980 to 1987, the drug agency seized only 19 pounds of peyote compared with 15 million pounds of marijuana.
The turnabout in the Government's peyote policy can be easily seen on this reservation, where almost half of the nation's peyote is consumed, according to official sales figures maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety.
About a century ago, as Plains Indian tribes tried to adjust to new lives on reservations, religious advocates of peyote traveled north from the area of historic use, along the banks of the Rio Grande in South Texas. These peyote missionaries went through Oklahoma, Nebraska, the Dakotas and into Canada spreading its use. It was taken up by the Navajos in the early 1930's, a time when Federal agents ordered the tribe's herders to cut their flocks of sheep to avoid overgrazing.
"It was a very devastating time for the Navajos," Professor Walters said, "and at that time the Navajo started converting to the Native American Church."
Now, about 60,000 Navajos, roughly one-quarter of the reservation, attend peyote ceremonies in teepees or hogans. Membership in the church, whose central belief revolves around the sky as creator and the earth as mother, has risen rapidly as Indians seek grounding in traditional ways.
Sobriety, morality, diligence and a spirit of self-respect lead a list of Native American Church "values and principles" proffered by Mr. Dayish at his family compound here.
Professor Walters, a church member, said: "The use of peyote is not the large part -- it stresses the old traditional beliefs and values. It is popular because it addresses the issues of the times: alcoholism, unemployment, breakdown of the family."
But peyote use has become so popular that church members worry that the growing demand is causing a shortage. Albert Hale, president of the Navajo Nation, also has warned the church to police incidents of peyote use outside of religious settings.
The son of a Road Man of the Native American Church, Mr. Dayish credits his religion with helping him get through the Marines, through college and into a job as a procurement officer for an international mining company here. Reflecting on his comfortable home and on his family life, he said, "I attribute everything I have to my worship."
He was echoed by Sergeant Arnold, who said the peyote rituals, even practiced under fear of prosecution, helped him succeed in the Marines. "It helped me get through 18 years without drinking," he said from Quantico, Va. "It helped me get my college education off duty. It helped keep me focused."

HEADLINE: A Hong Kong-Based Chain Will Buy U.N. Plaza Hotel

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration said yesterday that it would sell the United Nations Plaza Hotel, at First Avenue and 44th Street, to a Hong Kong-based hotel chain, producing an $85 million windfall for the city and more than doubling the yearly tax revenue from the property.
The deal with Regal Hotels International ends City Hall's 21-year tenure in the hospitality business and fulfills a 1993 promise by Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the Mayor-elect, to relieve the city of responsibility for the 427-room hotel. 
 The city tried to sell the hotel in 1995 but failed because of a complicated ownership structure. But that failure turned out to be a boon, officials said, because the value of hotels has risen markedly amid a resurgence in New York's tourism industry. Mr. Giulani said the hotel's value to the city had been estimated at as little as $30 million not long ago.
"We actually took the hotel off the market some time back, when we didn't think it would realize enough profit for the people of the city," the Mayor said yesterday. "I think that was a very wise decision now. Sometimes you make those decisions and they don't turn out to be wise decisions."
Mr. Giuliani recalled that in the early 1990's, there was concern about a surfeit of hotels in New York, "that we had too many hotels, and that our occupancy rates were at some of the lowest levels ever."
"It's very hard to get a room in a New York City hotel now," he continued. "New York City now has too few hotels. People are buying them. People are building them. This translates itself into a lot more jobs in the hotel business."
Officials said that shifting the United Nations Plaza Hotel's ownership from public to private hands would produce annual city taxes of $6 million, which would increase to $9 million by the year 2010. By contrast, the city's total receipts from its share of the hotel's profits, rent payments and property taxes has averaged only $2.48 million over the last 10 years, despite a high of $4.4 million in 1996.
"What the Mayor has done here is really to unlock the equity in the hotel," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "It's a classic example of smart privatization."
Under the deal, Regal Hotels will pay $102 million. After debt reduction costs and a $1.53 million fee to the city's financial adviser, J. P. Morgan Securities, the city will keep $85 million.
The sale is the latest good fiscal news for the Mayor, who issues his next budget tomorrow. Last week, Mr. Giuliani announced that the city would end its fiscal year on June 30 with an $800 million surplus, largely because of the boom on Wall Street.
The hotel has been managed by the Hyatt chain under a contract with the United Nations Development Corporation, an agency created by the city and state during the Lindsay administration. Last year the occupancy rate was 76 percent, just below the citywide average, and the average room rate was around $200, about $50 above the city mean, people familiar with the property said.
The hotel occupies the upper floors of two of the three office and apartment towers in the United Nations Plaza complex, across First Avenue from the United Nations itself. The city owns the land and one of the buildings housing the hotel. A private landlord owns the other building.
Regal Hotels has been on a buying spreein the last two years, with purchases including hotels in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago and Boston.
Douglas M. Pasquale, president of the company's United States holdings, said Regal had been looking for a New York property for two years. "We're an international brand," he said, "and we want to have a presence in international gateway cities, and there's really in our view no city more important, particularly in the United States. The tie-in with the U.N. will give us exposure to important dignitaries from across the world as we continue to expand."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says the Next Budget Includes Package of Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Laying a cornerstone for his re-election campaign, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that his next budget would include a new package of tax cuts for New York City residents.
Mr. Giuliani said in an interview that the package, which he is to present when he announces his budget tomorrow, would include cuts in the city's income tax and the property tax for co-ops and condominiums, as well as a tax credit that is intended to encourage people on welfare to find jobs. 
 The proposed tax cuts would total $47 million in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1. Their value would climb to $700 million annually in the year 2001, Giuliani administration officials said.
The Mayor said his aides were still working out the details of the cuts, so he was not yet prepared to say how they would affect residents at various income levels.
The Mayor clearly hopes that the tax cut package will help him leave as a legacy of his term a spate of such reductions. But the plan faces many hurdles because he wants to use increased state aid that has not yet been approved to make up for the lost revenue from the proposed cuts.
The Republicans who control the State Senate, for example, reacted coolly to the package, saying they doubted that they could agree to increasing aid to the city to the level that the Mayor would need to lower taxes as much as he proposed.
Even so, if the plan founders, Mr. Giuliani can take credit for pushing the cuts while blaming state officials for their defeat. In the interview, the Mayor acknowledged that it was often difficult to wrest more aid from Albany, but he said he believed that Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders would respond positively to his proposal.
"You never get all that you ask for, but I think that by putting it on the table, we will get something substantial out of it," the Mayor said.
In fact, he said, one theme of his budget speech would be a call for the state to correct what he contended were historic inequities in how it treats the city. He reeled off a list of grievances that he and his predecessors have long harbored: the city, he said, received less money for education, transportation and other programs than it deserved.
The Mayor in particular criticized two agencies that have long been targets of his ire, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is led by the Governor and runs the subways, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the city's two airports and is jointly controlled by the two state governments.
In the interview, Mr. Giuliani also said he had decided how to allocate an $800 million surplus that the city is expected to have at the end of its fiscal year, largely because the boom on Wall Street has created new tax revenues. He proposed spending $320 million, or 40 percent of the $800 million, on new programs, mostly for education and law enforcement.
He would spend an additional 42 percent to address the city's long-term budget problems by paying off more of the city's debt. He would use the other 18 percent to make up for lost revenue from an earlier package of tax cuts for city residents that he proposed in January.
The first package of cuts includes a proposal to eliminate the city's 4 percent sales tax on clothing under $500. The Mayor wants to make up for the lost revenue from that package, about $250 million, with money from the city's own budget.
But the second package of tax cuts, the one that the Mayor described yesterday, is premised on receiving more state aid. In other words, the Mayor wants $47 million in new state money to make up for the lost revenue for the next fiscal year, increasing to $700 million in the year 2001.
Some independent budget analysts criticized both tax packages, asserting that the city should not reduce taxes when it faces large projected budget deficits in the coming years. The Mayor's aides say the gap for the next fiscal year is more than $1 billion, in a $34 billion budget.
Mr. Giuliani defended the plans, saying they would help generate new jobs in a local economy that continues to recover from a long recession.
The Mayor said the new state money for the second tax reduction package would come from a plan that the Governor first announced in January. It is intended to provide tax relief to localities around the state by giving them extra state aid if they do not raise property taxes.
When Mr. Pataki first issued his proposal, Mr. Giuliani and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, complained that it would give the city only 8 percent of the new aid, even though the city has nearly 40 percent of the state's population.
The Governor then modified the plan to raise the city's portion of the new aid from 8 percent, to 12 percent. And his lieutenants pointed out that the Governor had a separate plan that was intended to increase sharply state education aid to the city.
Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that for his plan to work, Mr. Pataki and the Legislature would have to agree to increase the level of aid from 12 percent, to 37 percent. The Mayor said he spoke to the Governor on Monday and believed that the Governor would consider raising the percentage.
The approval of the Governor and the Legislature is required for the tax cuts, even if state aid is not involved, because the city's power to tax is largely governed by Albany.
Mr. Pataki's aides did not respond yesterday to several telephone calls seeking comment. But the Republican majority in the State Senate, which is dominated by suburban and rural lawmakers, said it had problems with the Mayor's proposal.
John McArdle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, noted that the city already receives 70 percent of state aid for welfare and Medicaid, which pays for medical care for the poor. And he said the Senate majority was also supporting the Governor's plan to increase school aid to the city.
"Is this realistic, given other budget needs and areas that the city already benefits from?" Mr. McArdle asked about the Mayor's package. "Probably not."

HEADLINE: Babies at Risk

BYLINE: By Leah Hager Cohen; Leah Hager Cohen is the author of "Glass, Paper, Beans: Revelations on the Nature and Value of Ordinary Things."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
When my son celebrates his birthday later this month, he will be -- according to new studies on infant brain development -- pretty much over the hill, cognitively speaking. In other words, he's turning 1.
The findings, which caused such hand-wringing after the White House held a conference on early childhood development last month, say that most of the neural pathways that determine a person's ability to think have been established by a child's first birthday. The strength of these pathways hinges chiefly on the number of linguistic interactions between "care giver" and child during those initial 12 months. 
 Or to put it another way, not only are my son's current intellectual deficits now his for life; they're my fault to boot.
That, at any rate, is the cynical dismay with which many of my friends have received the news, a sort of thanks-I-was-hoping-another-sword-of-Damocles-could-dangle-over-my-head resignation. While it's unlikely that scientists intended their studies to fuel criticism of mothers who work outside the home, women aren't exactly nuts to worry that the studies may increase the pressure and blame they already feel. When it comes to motherhood, the public never seems to hesitate before leaping from scientific discovery to societal judgment.
Nor is the blame all external. I know working mothers who feel real guilt over their decision not to stay home. Even mothers who stay home have reacted to this news with some alarm; it's a report of what they may have already, irreparably, done wrong. When I offered to mail an article on the findings to my sister (who quit her job to stay home with four children), she said, not entirely in jest, "Well, hurry up. The baby's almost 6 months old."
Yet virtually none of my peers need worry. Even if they weren't conscious of how many words per day they uttered to their babies in that first year, their babies in all likelihood will turn out fine. As they themselves did, and their parents before them. Children of professional parents tend to do well in school, to be successful adults, and to provide socio-economically privileged homes for their children. That system was intact long before positron emission tomography showed us how the brain gets wired.
But the findings are bad news for one group: the quarter of American families with children under 3 who are living in poverty. In their book, "Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children," Betty Hart, an emeritus professor of human development at the University of Kansas, and Todd Risley, a psychology professor at the University of Alaska, show that the number of verbal interactions between parents and young children differs radically according to income, with more privileged families having the most and families on welfare the fewest.
The Hart-Risley study suggests that the problem is poverty itself. No other factor in their study -- sex, ethnicity, race, whether both parents work outside the home -- made a discernible difference. The children in financially impoverished homes simply didn't receive as much verbal stimulation. If the first year is crucial in brain development, then children of poverty are in real trouble, and intervention programs like Head Start begin too late to help.
As a nation, we have a purported commitment to providing equal opportunity for all. We also have a long tradition of not living up to that commitment. The findings on infant brain development should not amplify criticism of mothers working outside the home, but prompt a re-evaluation of the way we treat families in poverty. I was wrong when I said middle-class women needn't worry about the new findings. We all must.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a United States Government report published today about the disposition of assets looted by Nazi Germany during World War II.
The report documents one of the greatest thefts by a government in history: the confiscation by Nazi Germany of an estimated $580 million of central bank gold -- around $5.6 billion in today's values -- along with indeterminate amounts in other assets during World War II. These goods were stolen from governments and civilians in the countries Germany overran and from Jewish and non-Jewish victims of the Nazis alike, including Jews murdered in extermination camps, from whom everything was taken, down to the gold fillings of their teeth. 
 Our mandate from the President in preparing this report was to describe, to the fullest extent possible, U.S. and Allied efforts to recover and restore this gold and other assets stolen by Nazi Germany, and to use other German assets for the reconstruction of postwar Europe. It also touches on the initially valiant, but ultimately inadequate, steps taken by the United States and the Allies to make assets available for assistance to stateless victims of Nazi atrocities. . . .
The picture which emerges from these pages, particularly of the neutral nations, is often harsh and unflattering. Many profited handsomely from their economic cooperation with Nazi Germany, while the Allied nations were sacrificing blood and treasure to fight one of the most powerful forces of evil in the annals of history. At the same time, our team knew that if we were going to shine the bright light of history on other nations, we also had to look carefully at America's role, and the study does so. . . .

Major Conclusions And Policy Implications
First, the massive and systematic plundering of gold and other assets from conquered nations and Nazi victims was no rogue operation. It was essential to the financing of the German war machine. The Reichsbank itself -- the central bank of the German state -- was a knowing and integral participant. It was the Reichsbank that knowingly incorporated into its gold reserves looted monetary gold from the Governments of countries occupied by the Nazis. Judging by German reserves at the beginning of the war, the majority of the gold was looted from central banks. It is also evident from the documents we have uncovered and reviewed that some amount was confiscated from individual civilians, including victims of Nazi atrocities, and incorporated into Reichsbank gold stocks. It was the Reichsbank that assisted in converting victim gold coins, jewelry and gold fillings into assets for the SS "Melmer" account. The Reichsbank organized the sale or pawning of this concentration camp loot, and the resmelting of a portion of this gold into gold ingots -- with their origins often disguised and therefore indistinguishable by appearance from that looted from central banks. . . .
Second, in the unique circumstances of World War II, neutrality collided with morality; too often being neutral provided a pretext for avoiding moral considerations. Historically a well-established principle in international law, neutrality served through centuries of European wars as a legitimate means by which smaller nations preserved their political sovereignty and economic viability. But it is painfully clear that Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and other neutral countries were slow to recognize and acknowledge that this was not just another war. Most never did. Nazi Germany was a mortal threat to Western civilization itself, and had it been victorious, to the survival of even the neutral countries themselves. . . .
The amount of Germany's gold reserves before the war was well known. Clearly, the evidence presented in this report is incontrovertible: the Swiss National Bank and private Swiss bankers knew, as the war progressed, that the Reichsbank's own coffers had been depleted, and that the Swiss were handling vast sums of looted gold. The Swiss were aware of the Nazi gold heists from France of Belgian gold as well as from other countries. . . .
The liquidation of hundreds of millions of dollars in German assets was neither promptly nor ever fully implemented. The Swiss raised one objection after another, arguing over exchange rates, insisting that German debt settlements be included, and demanding that the U.S. unblock assets from German companies seized during the war but which the Bern Government claimed were actually Swiss-owned. They refused to make an exemption for the assets of surviving Jews from Germany and heirless German Jewish assets, and continued to make them subject to liquidation. They refused to recognize any moral obligation to return looted Dutch gold when evidence became available after the conclusion of the 1946 negotiations. U.S. negotiators concluded by 1950 that the Swiss had no intention of ever implementing the 1946 Washington accord. Secretary of State Dean Acheson remarked that if Sweden was an intransigent negotiator, then Switzerland was intransigence "cubed."
Over a six-year period, before the final 1952 settlement, the Swiss Government had made only a token 20 million Swiss franc advance ($4.7 million then or $31 million today) for resettlement of stateless victims. Finally, in 1952, after a lengthy and frustrating effort, Switzerland and the Allies agreed to a total payment of only $28 million -- far less than the agreed 50 percent of the value of German assets in their country. The amount of German assets in Switzerland after the war ranged between press accounts of $750 million, U.S. and Allied estimates of $250-$500 million, and Swiss estimates of around $250 million. . . .
Nonetheless, the report raises serious questions about the U.S. role. American leadership at the time, while greater than that of our Allies, was limited. There was a demonstrable lack of senior-level support for a tough U.S. negotiating position with the neutrals. Moreover, there was an even greater lack of attention to insuring implementation of negotiated agreements. Because, for instance, the U.S. Government decided to unblock frozen Swiss assets in the U.S. soon after the signing of the 1946 accord, and, over the objections of the Treasury Department, decided not to pursue sanctions, most leverage was lost before Switzerland had met its obligations. Finally, neither the U.S. nor the Allies pressed the neutral countries hard enough to fulfill their moral obligation to help Holocaust survivors by redistributing heirless assets for their benefit.

Timing Set for Possible Cut In Gains Tax to Take Effect
Though Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill fell back into disagreement over details of their Federal budget plan, the Republicans did answer one important question about the deal, saying that yesterday would be the effective date of any reduction in taxes on capital gains.
A statement from Bill Archer (above), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and William V. Roth Jr., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said no specific provisions of the capital gains tax changes had been decided. But the announcement of the effective date, after the close of the stock market, was good news for investors who dumped shares. [Page D24.] 

F.C.C. Moves to Shift Phone Rates
The F.C.C. moved to shuffle billions of dollars in telephone rates -- raising prices for some services and lowering them for others, as its effort to set the ground rules for the coming battle in telecommunications proceeded. [A1.]
 
Productivity Up; Wages, Too?
Productivity of American business, a critical factor in determining the nation's standard of living, grew at a stepped-up pace of 2 percent in the first quarter, the Government reported. But the report also contained signs of possible wage pressures. A separate Federal Reserve survey of regional economic conditions found generally moderate growth. [D4.]
 
The data prompted new fears of inflation -- and of an interest-rate increase by the Fed -- in the bond market. A weak Treasury auction hurt prices, too, and the 30-year bond yield rose to 6.96 percent from 6.88 percent. [D19.]
 
Viacom Loss Smaller Than Forecast
Viacom said that it swung to a loss in the first quarter, though the deficit was below analyst expectations as a strong performance by MTV and the release of the movie "Private Parts" offset a deterioration at the Blockbuster Entertainment unit. [D10.]
 
News Corp. Earnings Up Sharply
The News Corporation said that its quarterly earnings rose roughly fourfold, helped by the addition of New World Communications Group TV stations and the re-release of the "Star Wars" movie trilogy. [D10.]
 
Hostile Offer for Hospital Group
Vencor announced a $639 million hostile bid for Transitional Hospitals, which had rebuffed a private offer from Vencor and agreed to a lower, friendly deal with Select Medical. [D2.]

U.S. Faulted on Swiss-Nazi Dealings
A Government report concluded that the United States stood by as the Swiss failed to respect a 1946 agreement to return hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that the Nazis looted from European banks and Holocaust victims. The report also cited Swiss bankers' "indifference to the needs of the victims of the Holocaust and their heirs." [A1.]

HEADLINE: Another Disagreement, on Education, Afflicts the Budget Deal

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
For the second time since they announced a deal to balance the Federal budget, White House officials and Congressional Republicans found themselves in disagreement today over the details, with much uncertainty about the terms of tax relief for families with children in college.
Such tax cuts were one of the Clinton Administration's highest priorities. In announcing the budget agreement on Friday, President Clinton said it provided for the largest increase in education spending in 30 years. And Gene Sperling, assistant to the President for economic policy, said the Republicans had agreed to "education tax cuts of $35 billion for a $10,000 deduction and a Hope scholarship tax credit" worth $1,500. 
 But today Republicans said they were not so sure of the details.
While that issue festered, Republicans did answer one important question about the budget agreement, saying that today would be the effective date of the expected reduction in taxes on capital gains, the profits from the sale of securities and other investments.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a joint statement that sales of assets "on or after today, May 7," would be taxed at a lower rate. But the statement said that no other provisions of the capital gains tax changes had been decided.
Nor had final decisions been made on the President's education proposals. One chief Republican negotiator, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee, issued a summary of the budget agreement, and it said: "The plan makes no commitment to a specific $35 billion for education initiatives. The Ways and Means Committee will determine the size and structure of the tax relief package."
The document says the budget agreement simply provides for net tax relief of $85 billion over five years, including tax credits for children, a reduction in capital gains and estate taxes, and "relief for families who send their children to college."
Senate Republicans said they had endorsed up to $35 billion in tax breaks for higher education over the next five years, but not necessarily the full amount.
Christina M. Martin, a spokeswoman for Speaker Newt Gingrich, said the Speaker and the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, "gave their word that they would work to get as close to $35 billion as possible for education initiatives."
In general, the Republicans are resisting Administration efforts to lock in tax and spending details. On Tuesday, the White House and Congressional Republicans clashed over details of the budget agreement affecting Medicare -- specifically, the provisions to protect low-income beneficiaries against increases in premiums. This dispute remained unresolved today, despite efforts to work it out.
The White House has drafted a letter embodying the President's understanding of the budget agreement, and he wants Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to sign it. The letter, which begins, "Dear Mr. President," says, "The package shall include a $10,000 tuition deduction and the Hope credit as envisioned under the President's fiscal year 1998 budget, costing roughly $35 billion through 2002."
But Republicans have set about rewriting the letter, saying it does not reflect their understanding of the agreement.
In the 1996 campaign and in his budget this year, Mr. Clinton proposed two types of tax breaks for higher education: deductions and credits.
Under one proposal, families could take a tax deduction -- of up to $5,000 a year in 1997 and 1998, and $10,000 a year after that -- for college tuition and fees.
Mr. Clinton also proposed a tax credit -- a direct offset against Federal income tax -- of up to $1,500 a year for two years' tuition at a college or a training institute. Mr. Clinton refers to the tax credits as Hope scholarships.
While budget issues remained unresolved, the Senate voted today to grant a reprieve to 500,000 legal immigrants threatened with loss of cash assistance and health benefits under the new welfare law.
The bill, approved on a vote of 89 to 11, would continue Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid for such immigrants until Oct. 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, when they may get further relief under the budget agreement announced on Friday. The outlook for the legislation in the House is considered good, and it is favored by the White House.

HEADLINE: Governors Stress Tax Cuts and Austerity

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The nation's governors are calling for state tax cuts of $4.4 billion next year, the largest aggregate reduction in at least two decades, and are seeking to keep spending increases at their lowest level since 1993, state officials reported today.
The states generally remain in sound fiscal health, the report said, with most of them maintaining sizable pools of surplus money for a rainy day. 
 But those pools have been shrinking for the last two years, and states remain vulnerable to tightened Federal purse strings, rising Medicaid costs, a loss of sales tax revenue to new methods of retailing and the possibility of an economic downturn, the officials said.
"In spite of the fact that revenue growth is relatively good, governors are not spending this money," said Raymond C. Scheppach, the executive director of the National Governors' Association, which issued the report with the National Association of State Budget Officers.
"The focus," Mr. Scheppach said, "is on efficiency."
Budgets proposed by the governors for the next fiscal year, which in 46 states begins on July 1, provide for spending increases totaling only 1.4 percent after accounting for inflation. If agreed to by the legislatures, the spending increases will be the lowest since a 0.6 percent increase in 1993 and well below the 1.9 percent average of the last 20 years.
States have had considerable success in recent years in holding down increases in spending on Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. Most of the reduction has come from moving Medicaid recipients into managed care programs.
After increasing for years by double-digit rates, the states' Medicaid costs rose by only 3.3 percent in 1996 and have remained relatively restrained this year, with a projected rise of 7.2 percent.
Despite the additional freedom that the new Federal welfare law gives them to reduce benefits to recipients, "states generally are choosing to maintain cash assistance levels under welfare reform," the study said.
The greater trend, however, is toward austerity, which Mr. Scheppach attributed in part to voters' demand for smaller government and more tax cuts.
But that trend also reflects a growing awareness that state tax revenues do not accelerate as sharply as Federal revenues even in a period of sustained economic growth; this has forced states to keep their spending under control.
With Republicans holding the governorships of 32 states, the push for lower taxes has remained strong, although many of the cuts proposed for the coming year are a continuation of programs enacted over the last several years.
The report said 25 governors had proposed net tax cuts for the coming fiscal year.
By far the biggest is in New York, where Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, has proposed a $1.9 billion net reduction in the final year of his three-year tax-cutting program.
Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota, another Republican, has proposed an $851 million income tax rebate, and Connecticut, Iowa, Ohio and Massachusetts are among other states planning big income tax cuts.
In addition, Georgia and Missouri are planning to eliminate or phase out their sales taxes on groceries.
On the other hand, 10 states are considering raising tobacco taxes, with Florida deliberating an increase of 10 cents a pack on cigarettes, and New Hampshire 25 cents.
Mr. Scheppach said one worrisome development for states was the growth of retailing through innovative channels like the Internet. To the degree that on-line retailing takes business away from customary stores, it could eat into sales tax revenue, the primary revenue source for most states.
"The taxation of electronic commerce raises many issues for states," the report said, "including identifying who is responsible for tax collection and ensuring uniformity of tax treatment among states."

HEADLINE: Candidates Unite in Attack on Whitman

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 7

 BODY:
Often sounding more like allies than foes, the three men seeking the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey met in their first televised debate tonight, using the occasion to attack the policies of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman relentlessly, while keeping their criticism of each other at a minimum.
"The common goal here is to defeat Governor Christine Todd Whitman next fall," Michael Murphy, the former Morris County Prosecutor, said during the debate. 
 Trying to portray himself as the calm, common-sense alternative, Mr. Murphy, who is running without any endorsements from the party's county organizations, reminded the other two candidates -- James E. McGreevey and Robert E. Andrews -- to maintain their civility.
"Don't do the Republicans' dirty work," he said.
During a one-and-a-half-hour debate that was broadcast on cable stations around the state, the three candidates criticized the first-term Governor on everything from her fiscal policy to her education initiatives to her inability to control automobile insurance costs.
But with less than four weeks to go before the June 3 primary, when voters will select a Democrat to face the formidable Mrs. Whitman, none of the three candidates seized the occasion to break away from the pack.
Mr. McGreevey, a State Senator and Mayor of Woodbridge, pointed to Mrs. Whitman's proposed pension bond sale and accused her of "governing by gimmick." He said the Governor had allowed auto insurance companies to increase rates 11 times since she took office in 1994, "costing New Jersey motorists an additional billion dollars."
Mr. Andrews, a four-term member of the United States House of Representatives, said that the Governor had poorly managed state revenues. "I would balance the budget by spending wisely what we take in," Mr. Andrews said. "I don't think we've been getting our 20 billion dollars' worth."
While each of them discussed individual plans to deal with various issues, many of their responses to questions showed that they were in complete agreement with each other, and many of their proposed solutions to problems were short on specifics.
For example, all three said they would like to have the state pay for all-day kindergarten classes and preschool programs, but they were not clear about how to finance such programs. Mr. Murphy, however, did note that he had proposed a 25-cents-a-pack cigarette tax for education.
After the debate, which took place at the Edison studios of News 12 New Jersey, a public television station, the Governor's campaign manager, Tom Wilson, said he was not concerned about facing any of the three prospective Democratic nominees.
"I'll take any one of them," Mr. Wilson said. "I thought we saw the long and short of what the Democratic Party has to offer: long-winded rhetoric and short on substantive solutions."
Despite Mr. Murphy's appeals, Mr. Andrews and Mr. McGreevey did not let the entire debate go by without lashing out at one another at least once.
As the two candidates who have won support from party leaders around the state, Mr. Andrews and Mr. McGreevey are considered most likely to win the nomination, and so while they did not attack Mr. Murphy, they did attack each other.
Mr. Andrews accused Mr. McGreevey of lobbying on behalf of a corporate polluter, and for his part, Mr. McGreevey noted that Mr. Andrews had voted in accordance with Speaker Newt Gingrich in Congress.
Still, in the end, Tom Byrne, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, said he was pleased with the tone of the debate.
"The focus was on Governor Whitman," he said. "I'm happy about that. We are all keeping our eye on the ball."
Tonight's debate was one of two that are required of candidates who receive public financing in New Jersey's gubernatorial race. Two more public debates are scheduled, one for May 16 and another for May 22.

HEADLINE: 61 Arrested in Air Cargo Sting Near Kennedy

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
It was three years ago that undercover agents took over a trucking business in the gray world of car repair shops, fast-food restaurants and overgrown fields off Kennedy International Airport.
On the second floor, the agents peered at closed-circuit cameras and eavesdropped through microphones planted in the building. Downstairs, other agents -- described by James K. Kallstrom, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York, as "the type of people who can go up to Alaska and sell refrigerators" -- proved their bona fides to people who came peddling everything from Heineken umbrellas and automatic assault rifles to a $500,000 shipment of Sony camcorders and $3 million in commercial aircraft parts. 
 "We just sort of passed the word," Mr. Kallstrom said. "The thieves beat our door down to bring their criminal business."
Yesterday morning, law enforcement officials fanned out across Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island and arrested 61 people suspected in the theft of air cargo from warehouses around Kennedy Airport. Most of them had brought stolen goods to the undercover agents, who were posing as middlemen. The agents had spent up to $1 million to purchase goods worth $13 million wholesale, the authorities said yesterday in announcing the arrests.
Most of the suspects will face either Federal or state stolen property charges. A few will also face robbery charges.
Law enforcement officials said the sting exposed an important feature of the region's black market: that goods are stolen from warehouses near the airport and end up being resold at flea markets and small boutiques. And while a few of those arrested had ties to the Gambino crime family, the full list of arrests suggested that organized crime no longer has a lock on the business of air-cargo theft, they said.
"It's not just organized crime that rips off air cargo," said Richard A. Brown, the Queens District Attorney. "It's the casual thief, the independent, the airline employee, the truck driver, the baggage handler. There's a whole subculture."
Traditionally, the theft of cargo from airport grounds was the province of organized crime, especially the Gambino family, whose leaders were based in Howard Beach, just west of the airport. But in recent years, a crackdown by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, pushed thieves from the airport.
About 80 percent of the goods recovered in the three-year sting were stolen from off-airport warehouses, where air freight companies store merchandise before distributing it, officials said yesterday.
"There's an underground economy out there that creates a substantial demand for low-cost merchandise for retail," said Zachary W. Carter, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
The market for such things as cashmere coats, Digital computers, I.B.M. computer monitors and Intel Pentium computer boards was clear to investigators. But the authorities were less certain of the market for commercial aircraft parts.
Included in the $3 million of aircraft parts the undercover agents bought were a radio altimeter and a flight instrument amplifier, both valued at $40,000. Most of the stolen parts belonged to Continental and Pan Am airlines, officials said.
"Whether it be the drug dealer or the foreign military group or the airlines that are operating overseas, there is indeed a black market out there for stolen aircraft parts," Mr. Brown said. "You don't go out and buy a gyroscope or an altimeter and give it to your wife for her birthday."

HEADLINE: Help Hispanic New Yorkers Become Citizens

 BODY:

To the Editor:
We have read with interest your May 6 front-page article "Giuliani Proposes That New York Help Immigrants Become Citizens." In our report "Nuestra America en Nueva York: The New Immigrant Hispanic Populations in New York City, 1980-90," written for the Ford Foundation in 1995, and in conversations with city officials, we recommended that the city establish naturalization centers in high-immigrant areas. 
 We suggested aggressive naturalization and voter registration campaigns to make citizenship and voting accessible to Hispanic immigrants.
We also suggested that these centers deal with other services that immigrants need, like English as a Second Language programs. The newest Hispanic immigrant groups are characterized by low rates of naturalization, and the active Hispanic electorate in the city is a fraction of its potential magnitude.
The proportions of naturalized citizens among the Hispanic groups in the city range from 17 percent to 19 percent for Mexicans and Guatemalans to 24 percent to 26 percent for Colombians, Nicaraguans and Dominicans.
Political party organizations have lagged in efforts to naturalize new immigrants. It is in the interest of democratic pluralism that Hispanic people should naturalize and take a more active part in New York politics. We commend the Mayor for his efforts in this direction and urge him to go further and develop a comprehensive policy on the incorporation of immigrants and their children into the city's political, economic and social fabric.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Retreats a Second Day; Report on Intervention Cited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday for a second day after a Japanese news agency reported that the central banks of Japan, Germany and the United States were preparing to sell it in an effort to halt its two-year rally.
Officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations began planning yesterday for such action, the agency, Kyodo News, reported, citing an unnamed official at the International Monetary Fund. The report, although considered implausible by many traders, still hurt the dollar. 
 "Every day recently, there has been talk of intervention, and that is keeping the dollar under pressure," said Karl Halligan, chief currency trader at CIC Bank New York. While Mr. Halligan and other traders said central banks would probably be satisfied with "verbal intervention" alone, he said he had sold some of his dollar holdings nonetheless.
The dollar traded at 125.13 yen in New York, down from 125.40 on Tuesday. The dollar traded at 1.7212 marks, down from 1.7228.
The dollar did rise against the British pound, which tumbled late in the day after Bridge News reported that an unidentified British Labor Party official said that the pound should perhaps join Europe's exchange rate mechanism at a much lower level than its present value. The pound cost $1.6113, down from $1.6337, the lowest since March 21.
The dollar had risen to a four-and-a-half-year high against the yen and a three-year high against the mark in the last several weeks. That raised concern among Japanese and American officials over the growing United States trade deficit with Japan.
Many traders remained skeptical yesterday that concerted central bank dollar sales of the dollar were imminent. "I don't think real intervention is in the cards now," said Hillel Waxman, manager of foreign exchange at Bank Leumi Trust. "The dollar is already coming off on its own, and Japan and Germany don't want the dollar too much weaker."
That is because a strong dollar helps lift their exports by making them cheaper in dollar terms. The danger is that if central banks sell dollars, they will not be able to "control the damage on the downside," Mr. Waxman said. "Then, they would have to turn around and buy dollars. So jawboning is the way for central banks to go."

HEADLINE: Borderline Working Class;
In Texas, Labor Is Feeling Trade Accord's Pinch

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
Even after 15 years of work, Maria Consuelo Garcia made only slightly more than the $4.75 minimum wage stitching together Polo, Fila and Sassoon jeans in the Sun Apparel Inc. factory here. Seeing friends laid off at her plant and others, she kept her sewing machine whirring to beat her quotas.
But that was not good enough. Company managers said their costs were still too high. Early in April, Ms. Garcia and 297 others were let go. Though Sun Apparel had no comment, the Labor Department said that these workers, and 320 others about two years ago, lost their jobs because the company is bringing in more goods from Mexico, where garment workers usually get less than $1 an hour. 
 Such job losses to Mexico are accelerating, especially among workers already at the bottom in pay and skills, according to economists and Government statistics. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect at the beginning of 1994, the losses, mostly to Mexico but some to Canada, have grown by more than a third each year. The Labor Department total of 124,000 includes a record 7,600 jobs lost in April alone.
Administration officials say that lower trade barriers with Mexico and higher American exports still leave Americans with far more new jobs than they are losing. They say the layoffs are more the result of the peso's crash in late 1994 and the lowered cost of Mexican labor than of the trade agreement, which they say kept Mexico's market open.
"In a economy as strong as ours, Nafta certainly hasn't had the negative impact that critics feared," said Ira S. Shapiro, a senior negotiator for the United States trade representative.
[President Clinton underlined the importance of economic ties with Mexico, the nation's third-largest trading partner, on his visit there this week.]
But even as the nation as a whole is basking in nearly full employment, workers in areas where dominant employers have cut back because of Mexican trade can find themselves living through a depression. While a side agreement to the free trade accord guarantees retraining, the Government has no idea how many have found new jobs. Officials call some programs outright failures.
What is more, a study that the Labor Department itself financed says that the count of 124,000 workers who qualified for training understates the true job drain. Some major companies have refused to acknowledge that they shifted or lost jobs to Mexico.
Johnson Controls Inc. tried repeatedly to block benefits for 276 workers laid off at its Bennington, Vt., auto battery plant in 1994 and still disputes the Labor Department's finding that its employees qualified for training. The department's standards for counting losses are tight, with more than two of every five retraining applications denied. Many workers and employers do not know to apply for assistance. Though dozens of the 4,000 apparel plants in Los Angeles have closed, workers at no more than four of the factories qualified.
Mexican trade, however, like trade in general, is less likely to cost American jobs than to restrain wages, explained Alan B. Krueger, a former Labor Department chief economist now at Princeton. "Trade does create winners and losers," he said.
The damage is most visible here in El Paso, a border metropolis of 700,000 whose economy has already become fully integrated with Mexico's and whose workers are therefore willing to accept the minimum wage. Also visible here, given the stark limits of the Government's retraining effort, is a community's struggle to find solutions of its own.
With an average unemployment rate of 11.7 percent last year, up about two percentage points since 1994, El Paso has lost more than 5,600 jobs to Mexican trade over three years, more than anywhere else. Most of those laid off are of Mexican background -- a third to a half of them American citizens, most of the rest legal residents.
More workers are having to seek jobs elsewhere. The Census Bureau reports that in 1995, almost 15,000 more people left El Paso than arrived, up from a loss of 1,400 residents in 1993, the year before the trade pact took effect.
Although a few workers left for Mexico, far more hunt for a paycheck elsewhere in the United States. From the Texas Workforce Commission offices downtown here, weekly buses have carried hundreds of workers away to temporary jobs, many in slaughterhouses, in states as distant as Iowa, Nebraska and even Alaska.
About 1,500 who stayed in El Paso found that the retraining program left them with no new skills or jobs. After spending $18 million on the program here over three years, Washington is spending another $4.5 million to retrain many of these workers yet again.
As a political theme, anger over foreign trade, especially with Mexico, is already in national previews. The House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, considering a Presidential run in 2000, is preparing to use the trade issue as a weapon against Vice President Al Gore, a vocal defender of Nafta. The Administration's plan to extend the free trade pact to Chile is bringing further attention to how well the side agreement on labor has worked.
In El Paso, unemployed workers regularly picket city and state offices and camp out for weeks by border bridges, demanding better retraining and jobs. Rather than bashing Mexico, they and their organization -- called La Mujer Obrera (the Working Woman) -- attack American corporations and politicians.
The outcry has helped turn Mayor Larry Francis, who once owned plants across the border, into a trade agreement critic. "When Nafta started surfacing, I supported it," he said at his office, whose view includes the border and the factories beyond. He now scolds El Paso's border-hopping executives for bleeding away employment and pulverizing roads and bridges with their truck traffic but doing little that benefits the city.
The city's business people consider the Mayor a traitor. Veronica K. Callaghan, an industrial park developer who just finished a term as president of the national Border Trade Alliance, told him at a meeting several months ago that the Mexican maquiladoras -- twin plants that handle assembly, usually with parts made in the United States -- were still El Paso's major source of new jobs. "What's behind this?" she asked the Mayor. "It's just doom and gloom."
The trade pact's defenders say that exports to Mexico have fully rebounded since the peso's collapse and are now at their highest level ever. But labor leaders, some economists and the workers themselves say that freer trade with Mexico has speeded the skewing of American incomes, hurting low-paid workers with few skills the most.
"I lost my job, my health insurance and all my other benefits," one laid-off apparel worker, Romana Melendez, told a raucous labor rally in April on the tiled central square here. "It's an injustice."
The job losses, though spread across the nation, have been concentrated in industries like apparel, auto parts and electronics. Many of those jobs have gone to the maquiladoras, whose payrolls have expanded by 300,000 in two years, to more than 800,000.
In its sprawling industrial parks, Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, had 177,000 maquiladora jobs by the end of last year, the most of any Mexican city and a gain of 77,000 in two years, according to Twin Plant News, published here. American officials hope that the boom on the Mexican side will reduce illegal immigration.
Some of those jobs came from Johnson & Johnson, which laid off 110 El Paso workers who had been cutting fabric for surgical gowns, drapes and other materials. Their jobs were added to the company's payroll of 3,000 in Juarez, leaving only about 25 Johnson & Johnson employees in a sterilization shop in El Paso.
Import restrictions long kept the cutting jobs in the United States, the company said. But with the trade agreement, the shift to Mexico became essential. "All of our competitors in that business are there," a spokesman said.
El Paso, having marketed itself for decades as a low-wage haven, is responding to the loss of low-skill employment by having its schools train workers in metal stamping, plastic injection molding and other trades. These programs have helped attract several companies that make parts for the auto and electronics plants across the border.
Even these jobs are becoming vulnerable to competition, though. Juarez schools, like those elsewhere in Mexico, are likewise improving their training, and Juarez plants are doing more molding and stamping of their own.
"The employers coming in could be using El Paso as a trampoline," before jumping off to Mexico, said Cindy Arnold, a La Mujer Obrera organizer.
In the face of rising unemployment, those here with little schooling have few hopes. Even workers used to getting by on little more than the minimum wage are finding that their checks from the retraining program, which average $146 every other week, are hardly adequate.
For Ms. Garcia applied for retraining after losing her job at Sun Apparel, those checks will come at the cost of self-respect.
"I have 30 years of living in the United States," she said, "and I have never asked for welfare or food stamps. But right now, what am I going to do? All I want is a job."

HEADLINE: Efforts at Retraining Have a Blurry Impact

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
When President Clinton decided in 1992 to support the North American Free Trade Agreement, he said that a side accord on labor was crucial. The accord guaranteed retraining for those who lost their jobs to Mexico.
"Nothing like this has ever been found in a trade agreement before," Mr. Clinton has said. "It insures that workers on both sides of the border can benefit." 
 But finding workers who benefited in El Paso, which has lost more jobs than any other city to Mexico, is difficult. Nationally, the results of the training program are at best unclear, since the Labor Department has turned responsibility over to the states with scant monitoring of whether anyone gets jobs.
Department officials say that many who lost their jobs to Mexican trade are retrained under broader, older programs. Although these programs generally have high success rates, the officials do not know how many workers who qualified under the trade accord have actually found new jobs.
In El Paso, the Texas Workforce Commission spent $18 million from Washington retraining 1,500 workers over three years. Many workers say they were simply dumped into crowded English classes that were meant more for general adult education than serious workplace preparation.
The workers are eligible for two years of retraining, receiving unemployment checks for the first six months, then, under the trade accord, an added year of payments at the same level. But as their benefits expire, workers say that the program has left them without new marketable skills.
Irma Montoya was laid off in July 1995 after eight years as an assembler and inspector at a thermostat plant operated by the Robertshaw Controls Company. Robertshaw, a unit of Siebe P.L.C., was shifting jobs to Mexico, but Ms. Montoya's only "retraining" came in English classes that failed to give her enough proficiency for a new job. Now that her benefits have run out, she says, "I'm on a diet."
One morning in April, Ms. Montoya joined a restive group of 75 others to hear Texas Workforce Commission officials say how they plan to make amends.
"We know that the training you have received has been of no benefit to you," said Juan Garcia, a retraining specialist with the commission, as Ms. Montoya nodded.
Mr. Garcia, speaking in Spanish, explained that the state now planned to provide another year of support and training under a new program offering the technical skills that employers said they seek. The workers will receive improved English instruction at the same time. "Businesses are demanding you know English," even for jobs where it is not necessary, Mr. Garcia said.
After the session, Linda J. Williamson, a state training administrator, said that Washington had only asked whether workers had received retraining, not whether it was appropriate or resulted in jobs. "There are no performance standards," she said. In El Paso, she added, "The past program has failed, without question."
The new program, costing another $4.5 million in Federal money, was devised only under pressure from community groups and local politicians.
But even belated efforts to provide some technical training are falling short.
Arturo Robles was laid off a year ago by an El Paso plant that made automotive wiring harnesses. Some fellow workers stayed on the payroll several months longer only by training workers in Mexico to do their jobs.
Not until January, Mr. Robles said, did he get any technical training. But his class in basic electronics was meant for troubled, disruptive high school students and stressed discipline ahead of learning. Teachers in these classes, pointing to the layoff victims, told the students, "You'd better work or you'll end up like them."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The budget deficit problem will be back, with a vengeance.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
SOMEBODY up there must like Bill Clinton, Trent Lott and Newt Gingrich. The last-minute projection that the Federal deficit would be $225 billion smaller over the next five years than previously estimated smoothed the way to a painless deal on the budget and may have spared the leaders the embarrassment of ideological rebellions among the troops.
But this gift from the gods may yet prove to be poisoned fruit, for while the accord should balance the budget in 2002 (assuming no recessions along the way), there will be little time to savor the triumph before Washington is again choking on deficits. Indeed, by postponing the reckoning, the deal could make the awful task of bringing long-run order to the nation's fiscal house far more difficult. "We needed at least a beginning on containing entitlements," argued Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for Economic Development, "and we didn't get it." 
 This has been a hard few years for deficit pessimists. The buoyant economy has generated far more tax revenue than expected, while the accompanying decline in unemployment and welfare caseloads has reduced the cost of the social safety net. Even without an agreement to cut spending, the budget deficit would have fallen to $75 billion this year -- the lowest as a percentage of gross domestic product since the 1970's.
Accordingly, the once-Herculean task of balancing the budget in 2002 has been downsized to the proportions of a vigorous spring cleanup. The deal would reduce outlays by about $250 billion across five years -- real money certainly, but just 3 percent of Federal spending over the period, and smaller, in real terms, than several past deficit-reduction packages. And even this figure exaggerates the sacrifice involved since the deal includes up to $35 billion in tax breaks for college costs, $50 billion in capital gains relief and $50 billion in unspecified tax cuts.
So why the grousing? Jack Kemp, the supply-sider's supply-sider, argues that the Republicans caved in on taxes. He wants to eliminate all taxes on capital gains and inheritances and make payroll taxes deductible.
The heavy-duty keening, though, is coming from analysts who are looking beyond 2002. Two months ago the Congressional Budget Office forecast that the deficit would equal 2 percent of the G.D.P. in 2002. In 2007 the office estimated that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid outlays would total 10.3 percent of G.D.P. (up from 8.4 percent in 1997) and that the deficit would creep up to 3 percent of G.D.P.
By 2020, when the baby boomers are heading en masse to Florida, the big entitlements would account for 14 percent of G.D.P., and the deficit would reach 7 percent of G.D.P. Then things really get out of hand. By 2050 the deficit reaches 18 percent of G.D.P. -- meaning that unless policies change, Federal spending will be almost twice as large as revenues.
Of course, those estimates are now slightly dated. But that does not change the fundamentals. Indeed, Robert D. Reischauer of the Brookings Institution, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, argues that the deal paradoxically helps lock in the deficit trajectory. That's because some of the "solutions" negotiators came up with to achieve a balanced budget in the near term actually make it harder to overcome the longer-range problem.
The Clinton Administration had agreed to clip an extra 0.15 percentage point off the cost of living adjustments for Social Security, generating savings that would have continued to accumulate past 2002. The negotiators were also close to capping the growth of Medicaid spending.
But both hot potatoes were dropped when the $225 billion windfall was announced. "It was a missed opportunity," Mr. Reischauer lamented -- one that could have been used as the matrix for the more difficult choices down the road. By contrast, the tax cuts will swell in future years.
All that is left of the assault on entitlements is a one-time cut in the Federal bill for medical services, virtually all of which will come from providers. "If you're a Medicare beneficiary, this deal should make you very, very happy," he concluded.
Politics is, of course, the art of the possible. "Three weeks ago I was convinced there wouldn't be a deal at all," recalled Rudolph G. Penner, a managing director of the Barents Group. Besides, mediocrity sometimes conceals quietly gestating achievement. "I'm hopeful the terms of the deficit debate are shifting," said Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute.
Someday, someway, though, Americans will have to find a way to reconcile the baby boomers' demands for a comfortable retirement and cheap medical care with the next generation's unwillingness to cover the cost. While Washington has put the deficit to sleep, it is bound to come back rested and ready to wreak political havoc.

HEADLINE: The Stain of Nazi Gold

 BODY:
The honest excavation of history can bring sobering discoveries, as the American Government has now found in an examination of Nazi Germany's stolen gold and its redistribution after the war. No nation emerges unscathed from this investigation, including the United States, and many are disgraced. It is saddening but not altogether surprising to learn that morality and justice, especially the international obligation to look after the survivors of the Holocaust, were swiftly sacrificed to expediency when the gold was divvied up after the war. Remedying this failure, as the report rightly notes, is the unfinished business of World War II.
The extraordinary inquiry, which involved the declassification of nearly one million pages of documents, was initiated by President Clinton after Switzerland coldly rebuffed Jews seeking to recover gold and other assets their families had deposited in Swiss banks before the war. Under the determined direction of Stuart Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of Commerce, and William Slany, a State Department historian, it touches on wartime economic collaboration with Germany but deals mainly with the anemic postwar effort to restore gold and other valuables to the nations and peoples from which they had been stolen. 
 Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Argentina will want to take notice. The extent of their economic cooperation with the Nazis has been slowly unfolding in recent years, but Mr. Eizenstat makes clear they profited from their neutrality. Even as the threat of German invasion waned in the last years of the war, Sweden sold Germany iron ore and ball bearings, Portugal provided tungsten for steelmaking, Spain traded goods and raw materials and Turkey shipped chrome. Argentina defied efforts to prevent the transfer of German funds there from Europe.
Switzerland is properly singled out. Though helpful to the Allies as a base for spying, it served as Nazi banker, gold keeper and financial broker. Switzerland provided Germany with arms, ammunition, aluminum and agricultural products.
These countries made only a fitful effort after the war to return the looted gold and other assets they received in payments from Germany during the war. Here America bears considerable responsibility. It led the postwar effort to recover and distribute the gold. Yet only a small portion of the $580 million in gold stolen from conquered governments, worth some $5.6 billion today, was ever recovered. Even less of the millions of dollars in gold and other assets taken from individuals was returned.
Switzerland was aggressively unhelpful, resisting accounting and recovery efforts for years and not honoring agreements to liquidate German assets held in Switzerland. The American report estimates that as much as $400 million in German-looted gold remained in the Swiss National Bank at the end of the war, but no more than $58 million was returned.
The task of tracing and apportioning the gold and other assets was daunting, but American officials tolerated intransigence by other nations and accepted pitiful restitution agreements in the name of cold-war solidarity. Eager to obtain access to an Azores air base in the 1950's, Washington let Portugal surrender only about one-tenth of the German gold it held at the end of the war. Spain eventually returned just $114,000 in looted gold from a stockpile of $30 million. Turkey, which held $44 million in Nazi assets and $5 million in looted gold, made no restitution. Only Sweden paid up.
The victims of this dismal record were the survivors of the Holocaust and others left homeless and stateless by the war. Assets that could have been used to help them were never returned to the countries plundered by Germany. Worse still, gold and other valuables found in Germany that had been seized from millions of individuals and households across Europe were knowingly mingled with assets stolen from European governments by the Nazis. As a result, gold that should have gone to help individuals through relief and compensation programs ended up in European and American government vaults, where some remains today.
These matters remained too long obscured from public view, shielded by excessive secrecy and national pride. It is late to redress the wrongs, but every effort should now be made to return gold and other assets to those with a legitimate claim. Switzerland, after long delay, is finally making an effort to trace and return assets deposited before the war. Mr. Eizenstat and Mr. Slany have performed a high public service by digging for the truth.

HEADLINE: As Chrysler Strike Ends, Other Walkouts Loom in Auto Industry

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 7

 BODY:
The United Automobile Workers publicly agreed today to end its biggest strike against the Chrysler Corporation in 30 years, but further strikes seemed likely soon in the auto industry, notably against the General Motors Corporation.
Nearly 1,900 engine factory workers went on strike here on April 10, forcing Chrysler to shut down five assembly plants that needed the engines for pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees. The engine workers were alarmed by Chrysler's plans to buy certain drive-shaft parts from the Dana Corporation, based in Toledo, Ohio, instead of continuing to produce them here. 
 The agreement concluded today is subject to a ratification vote at noon on Friday by the engine workers, but approval is nearly certain given the union's history of tight discipline.
The pact calls for Chrysler to keep production of its next generation of the auto parts here, said Roger Barham, a shop steward at U.A.W. Local 51. Chrysler also agreed that the workers here would have the right to transfer with full seniority to a second engine factory under construction nearby, which will supplement the current factory's output of V-8 and V-6 engines, Mr. Barham said.
Chrysler officials declined to comment on the pact until it was ratified.
But people close to the negotiations said Chrysler had won the right to proceed with plans to buy at least some of the current generation of drive-shaft parts from Dana. Chrysler had guaranteed all along that existing engine workers would not lose their jobs, but the union had feared that overall employment would fall through attrition if the auto maker signed long-term contracts with outside suppliers.
Top U.A.W. and Chrysler officials actually resolved the engine parts issue in negotiations late Monday and Tuesday morning. But some technical details and other minor issues, like procedures for workers to follow in scheduling their vacation time, were not settled until early this afternoon, delaying the announcement of the settlement.
Chrysler, General Motors and the Ford Motor Company all reached three-year national agreements with the union last year, but Chrysler and General Motors have had trouble since in working out factory-level agreements with local units of the U.A.W. In addition to the Chrysler strike, workers at two General Motors assembly plants are on strike, and another local strike at a G.M. assembly plant has been settled.
People close to the union said today that the union's national leadership was now making it easier for factory-level union locals to win permission to strike. The U.A.W.'s worry is that General Motors, in particular, has been trying to reduce employment by buying more parts from outside supplierss and redesigning assembly lines, and the union is determined to resist many of these moves at the factory level.
General Motors executives have insisted that they need to continue cutting costs to stay competitive with foreign auto makers operating nonunion factories in the United States.
U.A.W. locals are not allowed to go on strike without permission from the union's national leadership here, partly because a strike at a critical auto parts factory can force the temporary layoff of workers at assembly plants elsewhere. Chrysler, for example, has temporarily laid off 17,000 union members because of the engine factory strike and has filed legal petitions in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio asking that these workers be declared ineligible for unemployment benefits because they are indirectly linked to the strike.
Worries about the long-term financial health of General Motors prompted the union to authorize only assembly plant strikes so far this year, instead of strikes at parts factory, which could cripple the company's North American operations.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities' Prices Tumble

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A disappointing conclusion to the Government's quarterly refunding of the nation's debt weighed down on the Treasury securities market yesterday, cutting prices sharply.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond dropped 31/32, to 95 27/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.96 percent, from 6.88 percent on Tuesday. For bond investors the loss amounted to about $9.96 for each $1,000. The second part of the Treasury auction, in which 10-year notes were sold, was received with similarly low demand as the first part, of three-year notes, on Tuesday. 
 Before the auction, dealers had maneuvered to make yields of the new securities more attractive to investors in hopes of drawing buyers to the sale. But among the factors discouraging buyers from entering the market yesterday were the dollar's weakness and fresh data suggesting that the Fed could again raise short-term rates to tame an economy that may not be slowing fast enough to suit the central bank. A weak dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury issues less attractive to foreign investors. Dave Shabelman, Treasury market analyst at MMS International in San Francisco, called yesterday's sale of $12 billion of 10-year notes weak, with the average yield at 6.740 percent, up from 6.374 percent in February and the highest since 7.016 percent in July 1996.
He said the bid to cover ratio, or the ratio of total bids to the total amount of the auction, was 1.86 to 1, with noncompetitive bids totaling $383 million. Both of those figures indicate weak demand. Over the 12 previous auctions, the bid-to-cover ratio has averaged 2.24 to 1 and the noncompetive bidding has averaged $465 million, he said.
Still, Mr. Shabelman said the overall market could get a lift next week from new economic reports on inflation and retail sales. "Expectations of friendly data next week could provide some support once supply is distributed," he said. He said a Fed report yesterday on regional economic conditions contained few surprises, showing a continuation of moderate growth in most areas.
Investors, some of whom had waited for the report to gain clues to the intentions of the Fed on interest rates for its meeting on May 20, generally found little to steer the debate either away. But with the policy-making meeting so close, the report received a bit more of attention than it normally would have, and the mood remained cautious. Investors are waiting for possible hints today when the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, gives a speech at New York University. Some traders said expectations for a rate increase had already been priced into Treasury securities with short maturities.
More bearish for the bond market was a Government report that productivity of American workers during the first quarter grew at a 2 percent annual rate, slightly less than expected, and that unit labor costs rose at a 2.7 percent rate. The rise in unit labor costs, which was considerably above expectations, could presage future inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Wage Pressures Accompany Growth in Productivity

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The pro ductivity of American businesses ultimately the main factor determining the nation's standard of living -- grew at an annual pace of 2 percent in the first quarter, the best performance in more than three years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.
The rise was less than most analysts expected after last week's report of a sizzling pace of economic activity during the winter. Still, such a solid productivity gain for an economy in its seventh year of expansion is clearly "good news," said Edwin R. Dean, associate commissioner for productivity and technology. 
 On the worrisome side, the report contained some unsettling evidence of wage pressures. That increased the already strong likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again at its policy meeting on May 20, some analysts said.
Hourly compensation at nonfarm businesses rose at an annual pace of 4.7 percent, while unit labor costs, another gauge of inflation pressure, edged up to a rate of 2.7 percent.
In a related development, a Federal Reserve survey of economic conditions throughout the country found fresh instances of rising wages during March and April even though overall "upward wage pressures remained generally subdued."
The anecdotal findings, compiled in anticipation of the central bank's meeting on May 20, resulted in a summary description of continued "moderate" expansion for the 12 district economies. New York, however, was singled out for retail sales, which show "considerable slowing."
A second Fed report today showed that consumers added to outstanding installment debt at a 2 percent annual pace in March, the smallest since September and less than one-quarter as fast as the average of the first two months of the year.
But it was the productivity report, published in midmorning, that prompted the most scrutiny and helped set the tone for a day of significant retreat in the bond and stock markets.
The 4.7 percent surge in hourly compensation, which includes benefits and pay, appeared at odds with the bureau's Employment Cost Index, which was reported last week. It showed only a small increase in wages and salaries that was more than offset by a sharp deceleration -- to virtually nothing -- in the rise of benefits.
Joseph Liro, an economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York, called this a "stunning" rise even allowing for the fact that the two statistical series differed in their treatment of overtime and in the constant shifting in the numbers of workers in high-paid and low-paid jobs.
Both sets of numbers could be "right," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust, but he also said it was possible that the Employment Cost Index, usually considered the more accurate gauge, failed to pick up wage pressure captured by today's report.
Diane C. Swonk, deputy chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, advised taking today's surge with "a grain of salt" and suggested it would not significantly affect the deliberations of the Federal Reserve.
"They're still struggling with growth," she said, referring to the unsustainably fast 5.6 percent pace of economic expansion in the first three months of this year and an unemployment rate that fell in April to its lowest level since 1973. She predicted the Fed, lacking evidence of significantly faster inflation, would content itself with one final tightening of credit this month.
 Unit labor costs, another gauge of inflation pressure, climbed at a 2.7 percent annual rate, today's report also showed, up from 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter but below the 3.3 percent pace recorded in both the spring and summer of last year. For the latest 12 months, the increase is 2.9 percent, the report showed.
The Fed's beige book survey, based on information collected before April 28, said the main exceptions to subdued wage pressures were in "areas and occupations where serious shortages" existed. Minneapolis, for example, reported more bidding up of factory pay, while the Boston, Cleveland and Atlanta districts had higher rates of turnover. Employers in the Dallas and Cleveland areas were relying increasingly on bonuses to attract workers.
New York and Chicago reported "further tightening" of their labor markets even though economic growth in New York, which includes northern New Jersey and a small piece of Connecticut, "has slowed from the brisk pace" of the preceding report covering a period through early March.
The Fed's tally of consumer credit showed a sharp reduction in growth -- to a 3.7 percent annual rate from 12.7 percent -- in credit cards and other revolving credit, the largest category, and a contraction, at a 3.3 percent pace, in automotive credit that came after a tiny increase in February.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Withdraws Tax Break for Developer of Coliseum Site

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has decided to withdraw a generous tax break originally promised to the builder that wins the right to develop the New York Coliseum site, one of the most prized pieces of real estate in Manhattan.
The move surprised the five teams of developers still vying to buy the site, some of whom complained angrily that the Mayor was changing the rules in the middle of the competition. Some developers said that without the tax break -- worth up to $50 million -- they might have to revamp their plans and consider lowering their bids. 
 The cancellation of the tax break is another indication that Mr. Giuliani is trying to scale back such incentives as the city's economy strengthens. The Mayor agreed five months ago to award the tax break to the winner of the Coliseum competition.
But in recent weeks he has contended that it is becoming easier for the city to retain and encourage business. Last month, for instance, when he announced a deal to keep Standard & Poor's in Manhattan, Mr. Giuliani said he was putting more pressure on companies to create new jobs in return for tax incentives.
Yesterday, the Mayor's aides said he had concluded that with a rebound in the real estate market, there was no longer any need to offer inducements to lure a developer to a site as valuable as the Coliseum.
"We don't think that it makes any sense to have a new building with luxury apartments get that tax break," said John S. Dyson, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Giuliani.
Senior officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that owns the site and is conducting the sale in cooperation with the Giuliani administration, said they supported the Mayor's decision to withdraw the tax break.
Mr. Giuliani and the City Council agreed in December to include the Coliseum site in a program that reduces property taxes for developers of expensive residential properties who also construct or rehabilitate low- and moderate-income housing, either as part of the residential properties or elsewhere in the city.
All the developers competing to buy the site have luxury apartments in their plans, which also include 750-foot towers, offices, retail space and hotels. The developers who wanted the tax abatement said they would build lower-income housing elsewhere in the city.
The agreement on the tax breaks drew criticism from some Council members and from Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President and Democrat mayoral candidate. She said the city was foolishly sacrificing tax dollars on a site that was easy to sell. Giuliani aides and Council leaders said at the time that considering the troubled history of the project, the city had to insure that it would go forward.
Mr. Dyson said the administration had calculated that the tax break would have been worth $30 million to $50 million over 10 years. Technically, the Mayor does not have the authority to unilaterally cancel the abatement without the Council's approval. Instead, he is requiring that the winner of the competition sign an agreement not to seek the abatement, Mr. Dyson said.
The withdrawal of the break is likely to inject a new dispute into the long-contentious effort to build on the Coliseum site, which is at the south end of Columbus Circle, one of the most poorly developed crossroads in New York City.
Last week, after a delay of more than two months, the transportation authority announced five finalists in the Coliseum competition. Four said they had been certain to seek the abatement. The fifth, Tishman-Speyer Properties, said it had not been planning to seek the tax break, apparently because of the requirement that it build low-income housing.
Donald J. Trump, one of the four developers who had hoped to get the tax break, said it was difficult to build new apartments without it. He added that the tax abatement program helped the city in many ways, particularly because it required developers to build low-income housing in return for the abatement
"It's doesn't make me happy because I am the king of tax abatements," Mr. Trump said. "It is a big change, a significant change, and it is coming very late in the cycle."

HEADLINE: BIG RESTRUCTURING OF PHONE CHARGES APPROVED BY F.C.C.

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
In the most sweeping effort yet to set the ground rules for a coming battle in telecommunications, the Federal Communications Commission took steps yesterday to reshuffle billions of dollars of telephone rates -- raising prices for some services and lowering them for others.
The new rules, which were approved unanimously, will generally keep a lid on local phone rates for consumers while lifting rates for businesses. Long-distance rates for all customers will decline by 5 percent to 15 percent, under a related agreement between the commission and the AT&T Corporation, the nation's dominant long-distance provider. 
 The commission's chairman, Reed E. Hundt, said in an interview yesterday that the new rules would deregulate the industry even as they promoted a cherished goal of the Clinton Administration: connecting the nation's schools and libraries to the Internet.
"What we did today is to realize the impossible dream of connecting every single American to the information highway, while figuring out how to pay for it," a jubilant Mr. Hundt said.
But some lawmakers and industry experts said that the F.C.C., in trying to appease all potential opponents of the plan, had fallen short of its stated mission: to strip decades of subsidies from the nation's telephone industry and move it closer to a free-market model.
"The commission is doing less, and postponing it longer, than people ever expected," said Scott Cleland, an analyst with Schwab Washington Research Group, an investment advisory firm.
Mr. Cleland said the commission had tackled only a fraction of the $23 billion in subsidies that undergird the telephone industry. And the commission deferred until next year the thorny question of how to provide affordable phone service to rural areas, which are expensive to serve.
Still, yesterday's rules were a historic step in unraveling six decades of Government regulation. And they elicited a generally approving response from consumer advocates and industry leaders.
"Our great fear was that as you opened telephone markets, there would be a big rate increase," said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of Consumers Union, a lobbying group in Washington. "This sends the right message that we want to put downward pressure on rates."
Robert E. Allen, the chief executive of AT&T, said in a statement, "The F.C.C. has crafted a good compromise that will result in tangible benefits for American consumers."
These are some of the main components of the F.C.C.'s plan:
*It will sharply cut the charges that long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies for access to their customers by $1.7 billion in 1997 and $18.5 billion over five years. Access charges are set artificially high so that local phone companies can charge less for residential phone service than it costs them to provide it.
*It will establish a relatively small Universal Service Fund of $4.65 billion. The proceeds will go to equip schools and libraries with high-speed connections to the Internet, to provide rural health care centers with phone service and to continue to serve rural customers while the F.C.C. devises a new system of rural subsidies.
*It will impose an additional fixed charge of $1.50 a month on second residential phone lines, and an extra $3 fixed charge on business lines to help the local companies recoup the lost access revenue.
*It will allow the local companies to charge long-distance carriers a flat monthly fee of $2.75 a line for every business customer. Analysts expect the long-distance carriers to pass along that charge in the form of higher long-distance bills.
The MCI Communications Corporation and other long-distance carriers had argued that the F.C.C. ought to slash access charges by $10 billion in one fell swoop. The regional Bell companies warned that doing so would force them to raise rates for local service.
In the end, Mr. Hundt sided more with the Bells -- reducing the charges by only $1.7 billion in the first year. He said that a more Draconian cut was unnecessary because access charges would fall naturally as new rivals invaded the markets of the local companies.
Even the more modest cuts in access charges did not mollify some companies. GTE and BellSouth both harshly criticized the rules, saying that they would lead to higher local rates.
For now though, the F.C.C. seems to have heeded the call of several senators from rural states who publicly warned Mr. Hundt in Congressional hearings not to raise local rates.
Mr. Hundt even got a bonus over the weekend when AT&T signed an agreement with the F.C.C. to pass along all the savings it derived from lower access charges to customers in the form of lower long-distance rates. Based on AT&T's market share, that would amount to $900 million -- or a 5 percent decline in daytime and evening rates and a 15 percent decline in night and weekend rates.
Yesterday, people familiar with MCI said it, too, would pass along savings of $340 million; Sprint is also expected to follow suit.
Despite the F.C.C.'s delicate balancing act, there were clear winners and losers in the rules. Residential customers with one phone line will see no upward spike in their monthly local bill and may even pay less over all, since their long-distance rates will drop.
But people who order a second line will pay an extra $1.50 a month charge, in addition to the $3.50 charge for each line that all customers now pay. Some Internet service providers complained that this could dampen use of the Internet, since many people use second lines for on-line connections.
Stephen M. Case, the chairman of America Online Inc., said he was worried that a few consumers would drop his service. But he said he was relieved that the F.C.C. ignored the requests of the Bell companies to impose a whole new set of access charges on Internet service providers.
Businesses with multiple lines will also have to pay more: $3 a month for each line over the $6 a line they already pay. In addition, they are likely to absorb the $2.75 in flat fees that long-distance carriers will be charged by local companies for every business line.
The decision to load the new costs on businesses provoked a storm of protest from lobbyists for business customers. A day before the rules were issued, Mr. Hundt capitulated to their request to lower the flat fee to $2.75 a line from $4.50 a line.
"Businesses are going to continue to underwrite too many costs, but I praise the F.C.C. for taking out the worst of anti-business regulations," said Brian Moir, a Washington lawyer who represents the International Communications Association, a trade group for business customers.
Clearly, the sweetest moment for Mr. Hundt came yesterday afternoon at the National Geographic Society in Washington, where he and Vice President Al Gore celebrated the schools and libraries initiative with a coalition of educators and librarians.
Yet some experts said it was precisely the extra money for schools and libraries that would make the F.C.C.'s rules difficult to sustain over the long haul. In effect, the Government is adding new costs at the same time that it is trying to squeeze out existing subsidies.
"The Universal Service Fund is simply too big to encourage competition and deregulation," said Thomas Duesterberg, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who specializes in telecommunications issues.
Sharon L. Nelson, the chairman of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission, said she was worried that the F.C.C. could wind up shifting the onus for rate increases to the states.
Mr. Hundt acknowledged that the F.C.C. faced a hard slog as it began the next phase of deregulation: determining the cost of providing affordable phone service to rural areas.
But given the whirlpool of competing economic, political and commercial interests that the F.C.C. escaped this time around, Mr. Hundt was allowing himself to savor yesterday's achievement.
"Unlike Houdini, we did not do this in a locked safe underwater," he said. "We did this in full public view."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Shifting Burdens"
Proposed changes in the fees phone companies charge customers and each other would shift costs away from long-distance callers and onto customers with more than one phone line, especially businesses. Here is a summary of the major changes announced by the Federal Communications Commission yesterday, most of which would take effect on Jan. 1. SETH SCHIESEL
 
Customers will pay lower long-distance rates, but higher monthly charges if they have more than one line
 
Long-distance carriers will pay much less to local phone companies, and will use the savings to lower their rates.
 
Local phone companies will be paid for access to their networks mostly in flat monthly fees, which more closely reflect their costs, instead of being paid mostly by the minute for calls.
 
SUBSCRIBER LINE CHARGES
Customers pay these directly to local telephone companies. Fees listed are maximums allowed; some companies may charge less.
 
AS THEY ARE NOW
 
$3.50 a month per line for residences and single-line businesses.
$6.00 a month per line for multiple-line businesses
 
UNDER THE NEW PLAN
 
Unchanged for single-line customers.
For additional residential lines after the first line, raised to $5.00 a month.
For multiple-line businesses, raised to $9.00 a month per line.
 
PER-LINE ACCESS FEES
Technically, these fees are paid by long-distance carriers. In practice, the cost is often passed on to callers.
 
AS THEY ARE NOW
$0.53 a month per line for all customers.
 
UNDER THE NEW PLAN
 
Unchanged at $0.53 a month for single-line customers.
Raised to $1.50 a month per line for additional residential lines.
Raised to $2.75 a month per line (all lines) for businesses with multiple lines.
 
PER-MINUTE ACCESS FEES
Long-distance carriers pay local phone companies a per-minute fee for calls they complete, and build the cost into rates callers pay.
 
AS THEY ARE NOW
 
An average of 2.8 cents per minute to the local phone company on each end of a call (a total of about $23 billion a year).
 
UNDER THE NEW PLAN
Reduced over 5 years to at least offset, in the aggregate, the increases in per-line access fees and subscriber line charges. The exact amount of the reduction is not yet known, but may be up to 80 percent of the fees now charged.
 
The F.C.C. also announced changes in the way money flows to the Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes service for rural areas and the poor. The fund would get the proceeds of a new tax, expected to be 1 to 2 percent, on phone carriers' total sales, both local and long-distance. Per-line access fees formerly turned over to the fund would be retained by local phone companies. (pg. D6)

HEADLINE: Caribbean Policy Has Gone Into Hiding

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Caribbean Blues," your May 4 Week in Review article before President Clinton's visit to Central America and the Caribbean, hit the mark in describing the aimless way the Administration and Congress deal with near neighbors. 
 It may be unfashionable to say it in our self-absorbed times, but United States involvement in these countries -- in which I took part -- carried with it a duty to help, which has not been discharged.
True, no grand threat exists, like that which drove President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress and President Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative. But as your article suggests, regional ghettos from which stream poor migrants and drugs (and the criminal semi-states that profit from them) should provide fear enough.
Instead, the organizing principle for policy -- support for democracy and economic growth -- has gone into hiding. Trade had been at the center of the Clinton policy; now the Administration vacillates about extending the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The region can't wait until 2005; its leaders press for Nafta-style arrangements soon. Among other virtues, a staged approach, focusing first on these small neighbors, is more likely to facilitate negotiating authority from Congress.
When Congress effectively killed foreign aid for these regions, it had strange results. To control narcotics, the United States gives millions to police and military but can do nothing to help these countries educate their people, grow crops or wisely use their environment, which President Clinton rightly described as key to long-term growth and stability.
Perhaps President Clinton's visit will serve as a wake-up call, prompting a sense of urgency and a more vigorous and coherent effort. Otherwise history will find a way to bring home the consequences in places north.

HEADLINE: TV SPORTS;
Olbermann Still Visible Despite a Forced Exile

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Keith Olbermann yesterday marked his ninth day of involuntary exile from ESPN's "Sportscenter" for a rap sheet of alleged naughtiness against the network that culminated on April 16, when he appeared on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" without ESPN's say-so.
Olbermann probably irked ESPN further by informing Craig Kilborn, the host, that Bristol, Conn., the bustling capital of the ESPN empire, was the most godforsaken place on earth. Such impudence! Why hasn't Boston Market dumped Olbermann as its spokesman and stripped him of his Chicken Carver rights? 
 All this occurs as Olbermann -- a witty, intelligent wisecracker, who recently linked the planned exhumation of Checkers, Richard Nixon's dog, to the woeful Chicago White Sox -- looks beyond his ESPN contract, which runs through Dec. 31.
Surely, Fox Sports Net would crave Olbermann's style and following for its sports news operation; maybe CNN/SI would, too. Perhaps ABC News would like him as Peter Jennings's heir apparent; why not keep the job in the Disney corporate family? It's not farfetched: Roone Arledge, the ABC News chairman, came from sports.
"Everything is up in the air," Olbermann said before his house arrest. "Right now, I can only talk to ESPN. I don't have a burning desire to leave, but five years is time to reflect, 'Do I want to continue doing this?' "
 Even if Olbermann cannot be seen on ESPN until at least Tuesday, he remains visible in his Boston Market commercials and in "The Big Show: Inside ESPN's Sportscenter" (Pocket Books), a new book co-authored with Patrick.
The book is an informative hoot, especially after you grow accustomed to the dueling typefaces that signify when Olbermann talks and when Dan Patrick, his "Sportscenter partner, talks. (Olbermann said he chose the typefaces, forcing Patrick into a bland, sans serif style.) The format offers the pair of scamps a platform to offer advice, barbs and behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and to explain why Olbermann cannot drive a car yet lives in a most godforsaken place without mass transportation.
Advising future sportscasters, they write: "Don't say, 'Welcome back.' The viewer didn't go anywhere: you did." Nowhere do they advise their brethren to ask for permission to make appearances on any network but their own.
Although they advise against doing infomercials, they do not caution against making commercials, as in Olbermann's Boston Market spots. (He insists he eats plenty of Boston Market chicken, which gets delivered to his Bristol desk.)
Who could guess that a job he took for money would mean something substantial to viewers, other than being aware of the second-chicken-for-a-buck deal? Usually, Olbermann specializes in phrases that connect meaningful pop culture ephemera to sports news, erudite stuff like "Niedermeyer: Dead."
But two words from Olbermann -- "Eat something!" -- to the waifish models in the commercials provoked a positive response from eating disorder groups.
Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for Boston Market, said: "A couple of groups have asked for copies to show to conventions."
The other impact of the ads? "They're very well paying," Olbermann said.
 
 
Channel 11 Is the Right Choice
 In the end, the smart path was taken: Channel 11, not Channel 31, has 40 Yankee games this season and 50 next year. "PIX offered certainty; BIS did not," said Joe Cohen, who runs the MSG Network, and controls 150 Yankee telecasts per season. MSG could not risk a deal with Channel 31, a weak UHF station that needs to upgrade its antenna strength.
Now, after six years of being paid by MSG to carry 50 games a season to maintain a free broadcast outlet, Channel 11 is paying a hefty per game fee. The station can now sell the advertising time, which it could not before, and promote its WB Network programming to the heavily male Yankee demographic.
Cohen would not say what Channel 11 was paying. But inflation and the Yankees' success surely drove the price above $147,000 per game, which is what Channel 11 paid for 75 games in 1990, when it last paid a rights fee.

HEADLINE: Fuji to Start Making Film at U.S. Plant

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 8

 BODY:
The Fuji Photo Film Company said today that it would begin manufacturing photographic film in the United States.
Fuji plans to invest $200 million in a plant in Greenwood, S.C., to make 35-millimeter color film. It will also expand capacity for color-photographic paper at the plant by 50 percent to meet growing demand. 
 Fuji is embroiled in a dispute with the Eastman Kodak Company, which has complained to the World Trade Organization that Fuji and the Japanese Government have conspired to limit the American company's share of Japan's market. Analysts said Fuji's plan to make film in the United States for the first time was unrelated to the trade fight.
Toshihiko Ginbayashi, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd., said Fuji's strategy had been to make photographic products in Japan, Europe and the United States. "This capacity expansion is independent of the W.T.O. problem," he said. Fuji will hire 100 workers, bringing the total at the plant to 1,200.
Kodak has about 70 percent of the American market for photo film and only about 10 percent of Japan's market. Likewise, Fuji has about 70 percent of Japan's market and 10 percent of the American market, a Fuji spokesman said.

HEADLINE: April Sales Show Retailers Still Lag Behind Economy

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Are American retail stores operating in the same economy as the rest of the country?
It would seem not, given the relative sluggishness of their sales this year. Yesterday proved no different when retailers reported their monthly same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least a year. The results were somewhat weak, lagging behind other recently released economic data. 
 The Goldman, Sachs & Company Retail Composite Index rose 3 percent in April over a year earlier, when it inched up a mere 1.5 percent. Given the extra shopping day that made April 1997 an easy comparison with April 1996, and the fact that certain companies have outperformed their peers each month, it would seem that too many stores continue to flirt with too few shoppers, dragging sales down for all.
As a result, many mutual fund managers, who in previous years filled their portfolios with retail stocks, have developed an aversion to the group. "I would say in general retail is not a terrific place," Diane Sobin, a portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds, said. "You have to be really selective."
Lower-priced stores outperformed other retailers last month, as they have all year. Ross Stores Inc. reported gains of 10 percent, up from gains of 9 percent a year earlier. The TJX Companies, a Ross peer, saw its sales rise 7 percent, but sales fell 2 percent at the Filene's Basement Corporation and 5 percent at Value City Department Stores Inc. The two stronger retailers have generally outperformed their weaker peers all year, perhaps underscoring that there is a player or two too many in the segment.
Department store results were mixed, with stores that cater to slimmer wallets faring better than the luxury segment. For example, Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a sales gain of 6.2 percent, and J. C. Penney & Company's sales rose 5.7 percent. The May Department Stores Company reported a 3 percent rise. Kohl's Department Stores, another lower-end department store and a unit of the Kohls Corporation, gained 9.5 percent, continuing that company's stellar run this year.
In contrast, Saks Holdings Inc., which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, reported that sales rose a mere six-tenths of 1 percent, and the Neiman Marcus Group, a unit of Harcourt General Inc., lost three-tenths of 1 percent.
Particularly poor performers were specialty clothing retailers, a group that has been hammered for years and still cannot seem to maintain long-term strength. Almost every specialty apparel store that Goldman, Sachs follows reported sales declines: Gap Inc. said its sales fell 6 percent, The Limited Inc. lost 5 percent, Talbots Inc. dropped a whopping 16.6 percent, and Eddie Bauer Inc., a unit of Spiegel Inc., reported a 2 percent loss.
Many analysts and retail executives cited cool weather for the poor apparel results. While the Midwest and Northeast have experienced some unseasonably cool temperatures, department and off-price stores were able to report strong numbers without special access to higher temperatures.
The soft retail sales figures are confounding when juxtaposed with other recently released economic data. Unemployment fell below 5 percent in April for the first time in nearly 25 years, and consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the six months ended in March, its highest rate since 1988. Economic growth was 5.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, well above forecasts. During the same period, productivity of American businesses grew at an annual clip of 2 percent, a three-year high.
There is additional evidence that would seem to bode well for retail sales. Consumer confidence in April, measured by the Conference Board's index, fell to 116.8 from 118.5 in March, but it had been close to an eight-year high. And consumer installment debt grew at a 2 percent annual pace in March, the smallest monthly rise since September. Analysts had been attributing torpid sales to consumer debt for months -- so by their logic, shoppers should be ready for another trip to the dressing rooms.
So what is the reason? One theory is that stores have slowly been raising prices to improve profit margins while weaning consumers from bargains. "I have a sense that there is a certain amount of inflation creeping into the economy, although I don't think people are seeing it as inflation," David Blitzer, chief economist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said. "There is slightly less sale merchandise out there, and consumers are doing what they have learned to do very well, which is bargain hunt."
Clearly, raising prices would be a lot easier if there were fewer players on the field to mark down prices when sales turn sluggish. "One thing about overcapacity," Mr. Blitzer said, "is you have to compete a little harder."
All of this makes retail stocks a tough sell. One portfolio manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said this week: "We generally look at things from the big picture, and retail has suffered from over-capacity for many years. If the Fed tries to slow the economy down, the longer term is not that great for retail. I won't let myself own the group."
Retail analysts tend to be more hopeful about the group. "We don't think that one should generalize that retail sales are slowing," Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said. "We are late in the cycle, and that is not the time when retail stocks outperform. The best time to buy the group is when you are coming out of a recession.
"Overcapacity is definitely one of the factors," Mr. Baum added. "But marginal companies don't go out overnight."

HEADLINE: Late Selloff Blunts Sharp Rise as the Dow Ends Up 50.97

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
If investors want volatility, they have it.
Following a drop Wednesday of 139.67 points, the Dow Jones industrial average responded through much of yesterday with a sharp rise -- at one point advancing nearly 130 points, or 1.8 percent. Other major indexes were also rebounding strongly, with the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks up almost 1.7 percent. 
 But all that came before a late afternoon selloff, in which the Dow and S.& P. gave up much of the day's gains. At the close, the Dow was up 50.97 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,136.62; the S.& P. finished at 820.26, up 4.64 points, or 0.57 percent.
Technology stocks fared better, and the Nasdaq 100 index, heavy with technology issues, held onto its gains, closing up 10.06 points, or 1.1 percent, to 919.35.
What remained of the early rally was led by I.B.M., up 5 1/4 a share, to 167 3/8; Intel, up 2 7/8, to 158 3/4, and Microsoft, up 1, to 116 1/2.
A drop in interest rates in the bond market bolstered financial stocks. The rate drop, with the yield on the 30-year bond slipping to 6.93 percent from 6.96 percent, erased part of the jump of 8 basis points on Wednesday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Also moving sharply yesterday was the dollar, which fell against the German mark and the Japanese yen, continuing a three-day slide. Currency traders debated whether that decline, with the dollar down 2.4 percent against the yen and 1.5 percent against the mark for the three days, signaled an end to the dollar's yearlong rally.
Audrey McNiff, a vice president in foreign exchange sales at Goldman,Sachs & Company, said that it was still too early to come to that conclusion, especially because the large flow of Japanese investment to the United States continues. The dollar's decline did not appear to have an impact on the stock or bond markets.
The recent sharp swings in the stock market -- there have been 13 100-point moves in the Dow up or down this year alone -- has led some analysts to wonder just what is going on.
"It has been such a strange market," said Melissa R. Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities. "It reminds me of a cartoon. Everybody rushes to the side of the ship and it tilts one way and then everybody rushes to the other side and it tilts the other way."
Whether it is rational or irrational, even bullish analysts like Joseph V. Battapaglia, the chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company, are surprised by the rush to new highs that the Dow and the S.& P. have made this week. He thinks that the prospect of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve when its policy-setting committee meets May 20 should have kept these indexes from setting new records.
"I am assuming there is one coming," he said of a rate increase, "and I felt that the market would not rally back to new highs with that in mind."
He said that he expects both smaller-company and technology issues to outperform the 30 stocks in the Dow in the near future. Both sectors have underperformed this year, especially small-capitalization stocks. While the Dow is up 10.7 percent this year, the Russell index of 2000 small-cap stocks is down three-hundredths of 1 percent. Yesterday, the Russell slipped 0.12 point, to 360.10.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs and one of Wall Street's most influential bullish analysts, has been issuing notes of caution about the near-term outlook for stocks.
In her most recent note to clients, she said that "hindrances to further dramatic price increases in the short term" include a May 20 rate rise by the Fed; the need for investors to become more confident about the outlook for 1998 corporate earnings, and the lack of details in the deficit-reduction package announced last week by the White House and Congressional Republican leaders.

HEADLINE: Trade Storm Imperils Caribbean Banana Crops

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MORNE PANACHE, St. Lucia

 BODY:
For 20 years, Alfred Prosper has earned a living growing bananas on a six-acre plot that he owns near here. He is not a rich man, he will tell you, and the work is hard, but he has always made enough money to feed his family and to hire half a dozen workers to help him.
But now Mr. Prosper, like thousands of other banana farmers throughout the Windward Islands, finds himself at the center of a bitter international trade dispute that threatens his livelihood. At the urging of Chiquita Brands, a unit of the American Financial Corporation and the world's largest banana producer, the Clinton Administration is seeking to overturn an agreement that guarantees small Caribbean banana farmers special access to the European Union market. 
 "Why is America doing this to us?" Mr. Prosper, 53, asked as his crop was being boxed at a weighing station here the other day. "This is a little place, and this is all that we know, and what we depend on. We have nothing else and we hurt nobody, but now they want to take even this from us."
Much as in neighboring Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one-quarter of the labor force in this country of 145,000 people is employed in the banana industry, either growing, processing or shipping the fruit. In contrast to Central America, where workers paid as little as $2 a day grow most of Chiquita's bananas, Caribbean banana workers are mostly independent growers who own the small plots they farm.
"We have avoided the strife and turmoil that has plagued Latin America precisely because we don't have a plantation economy and our distribution of income is better," said Rupert Gajadhar, who grows bananas on 15 acres and is the chairman of the St. Lucia Banana Growers Association. "What do the Americans want to do -- reduce us to another Haiti?"
The Caribbean banana industry has long had special access to the European market, but the current dispute dates back to 1993, when the European Union adopted a system of preferences that guarantees banana producers in current or former British and French colonies a share of the European Union market, which has the highest per capita consumption of bananas in the world. In turn, a quota was placed on imports of bananas grown in Central and South America, where American producers like Chiquita and Dole Food have led the industry for a century.
Those preferences are scheduled to expire by 2002, and are unlikely to be renewed even if the American attempt to eliminate the quotas for Central and South American bananas ultimately fails. But in a preliminary judgment in late March, the World Trade Organization largely endorsed Washington's position, which is that the quota system unfairly restricts the American companies' access to the European market. A formal ruling is expected soon.
Thomas F. McLarty, Mr. Clinton's special adviser for Latin American and Caribbean affairs, said the Administration's policy was based on national interest and belief in free trade. The Clinton Administration recognizes there are "very deeply felt concerns among those countries that produce bananas," but "there are much better ways to solve this problem than just letting it ride."
"In terms of our primary goal of fair trade, you can't have discriminatory practices and not exercise your rights," Mr. McLarty said in a recent interview in Barbados. "It gets to the very principle of how you conduct your business."
American military officials who are directly involved in combating the flow of cocaine and marijuana through the islands of the eastern Caribbean have expressed concern that broader American interests could be damaged if the Caribbean banana industry is crippled. Gen. John Sheehan, chief of the Atlantic Command, has warned that a likely result will be an increase in drug cultivation and trafficking and emigration from the region.
"If you start deteriorating the economic infrastructure in the region, it is going to become my problem," General Sheehan said at a forum in Washington last year.
Aware that their preferential trade arrangement is probably coming to an end by 2002 anyway, the governments of the Caribbean have been seeking help from London and Washington in an effort to become more efficient and develop new crops and industries. But the American attempt to accelerate the cutoff of market preferences, they argue, undermines such efforts.
"The W.T.O. has cut off some of the space we had to play with and to get ready for the big change we know is coming," said Patrick Joseph, a leader of the Banana Salvation Committee, a lobbying group formed by banana farmers here.
Theresa Alexander-Louise, an economist at the Windward Islands Banana Exporting and Development Company, a consortium whose headquarters is in St. Lucia, said: "We are used to coming back from natural calamities like hurricanes, flood or drought. But if the markets for our bananas are taken away, that will be a disaster greater than any hurricane we have ever experienced."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Sony Posts Huge Increases In Net for Quarter and Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 8

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation said today that earnings surged more than tenfold in its fiscal fourth quarter, helped by the weak yen and sales of its Playstation video game.
The company earned 12.34 billion yen ($99.5 million), or 23 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, up from 1.03 billion yen ($8.23 million), or 3 cents a share, in the 1996 quarter. Revenue rose 23.5 percent, to 1.4 trillion yen, or $11.82 billion. 
 The results of the consumer electronics giant were among the first of many earnings reports scheduled for the next two weeks that are expected to show that Japan's export-oriented electronics and automobile companies have largely recovered from the slump of the last few years. The turnabout is partly a result of the companies' restructuring and partly because of the weakening of the yen, which makes Japanese products more competitive overseas.
Some of the strongest companies, like Toyota, Honda, Canon and TDK, are expected to report extremely robust earnings. Even troubled companies should do better, with Nissan expecting to report its first consolidated profit in five years and Mazda hoping to break even.
Japan's consumer electronics industry over all is expected to report 82 percent growth in operating profits in the last year, almost entirely because of the weaker yen, according to estimates by ING Baring Securities. But some huge general electronics companies, like Hitachi and Toshiba, will see their earnings hurt by the severe drop in the price of computer memory chips.
Over all, analysts say, with Japan's years of rapid growth behind it, not all companies can prosper. The Japanese business world is dividing into winners -- mainly internationally competitive companies -- and losers, with stock prices diverging accordingly.
For its fiscal year ended March 31, Sony said its consolidated net income rose to 139.5 billion yen ($1.12 billion), a gain of 157.1 percent from the year before, surpassing its previous peak earnings set in the early 1990's before Japan's economy entered a prolonged slump. Revenue rose 23.3 percent, to 5.66 trillion yen, or $45.67 billion.
The yen's 15 percent year-over-year decline versus the dollar gave Sony a big boost; the company obtains about 70 percent of its revenue outside Japan. Had currency rates not changed, the company said, its revenue would have been the yen equivalent of $4.2 billion lower than reported, and its operating income would have dropped 6.9 percent rather than risen 57.4 percent.
Sony's earnings in the United States were dragged down by a substantial loss at the Materials Research Corporation, a company based in Orangeburg, N.Y., which Sony acquired in 1989 for about $60 million. Materials Research, which makes equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, appears to have lost more than $100 million; Sony said it might sell it.
Sony, however, has been helped worldwide by its Playstation video game. Some 13.5 million units have been sold worldwide since its introduction in 1995. Sales of video game hardware and software reached about 400 billion yen ($3.2 billion) last year, said Joseph Osha, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. That is roughly even with the expected sales of Nintendo, long the leader in home video games.
Sony's revenue in Japan, where the company was not helped by the weakening yen, still rose 15.3 percent, with sales of its mini-disk music system growing sharply and digital camcorders selling well.
Sony's movie business, which has been plagued the last few years by box office failures, cost overruns and management turmoil, registered an increase in sales of 37.8 percent, to 438.5 billion yen ($3.54 billion), partly because of currency rates.
While movies released by its Columbia and Tri-Star studios had "disappointing results" at theaters, the company said, this was more than offset by proceeds from television programs, videocassettes, movie licensing and by the box office hit "Jerry Maguire."
Sony does not provide a profit figure for the movie operation but said operating income for its entertainment business over all, which includes records, rose 20.8 percent, to 66.3 billion yen ($534.5 million). Sales of its music group rose 14 percent, to 585.0 billion yen ($4.7 billion).
But if the Hollywood business now seems to be stabilizing, Sony was hit by the loss from Materials Research. Without that problem, executives said, Sony would have seen its operating income from United States operations rise 40 percent instead of falling 4.5 percent, implying a loss at Materials Research of $116 million.
Sumio Sano, Sony's director of corporate affairs, said that "a sale is one of the options" being considered for the subsidiary, which is in the midst of a revamping to prevent further losses. But Kenji Tamiya, a senior managing director, said Sony would prefer to nurse Materials Research back to health.
Mr. Tamiya said Materials Research had fallen behind in technology, and that Sony's semiconductor strategy had changed.

A Report on Jobless Claims Aids a Rally in Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices recovered yesterday from Wednesday's selloff, helped by a report that showed initial claims for unemployment benefits remain at a five-month high.
The data suggested that the economy might be slowing enough to keep inflation at bay and the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. 
 As a result, short-sellers, who had bet that Treasury prices would continue to fall, surged back into the market to limit their losses. Short- sellers sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, pocketing the difference.
But if prices begin to rise instead of fall -- as they did yesterday -- these participants have to cover their short positions and buy back the securities to limit losses.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond ended yesterday up 11/32at 96 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.93 percent, from 6.96 on Wednesday. Bond prices fell sharply on Wednesday, hurt by disappointing auctions of new Treasury notes, and the yield rose 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
"You're facing a market that has done a good job whipsawing some traders, but hasn't really generated a lot of casualties," said Dave Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston. "There's a growing belief that the anomaly of the week was Wednesday's negative price action, which was merely an auction trade. There has been some solid buying through the session.
"There isn't a substantial bias to the upside from these levels," Mr. Burtnick continued, "but you've clearly left the bears in a tough position going forward."
In yesterday's weekly unemployment claims report, the number of workers applying for state jobless benefits for the first time held steady last week at a seasonally adjusted 347,000. Analysts had expected a decline of 13,000, to 334,000.
Traders said bond prices were also supported by the Federal Reserve, which came into the market as a buyer. The central bank bought $733.8 million of Treasury securities for its own account in what is called a coupon pass, a move that permanently adds cash reserves to the banking system. The Fed said it bought securities with maturities ranging from 2002 to 2007.
But the dollar continued to weaken yesterday, and that in turn limited bonds' gains. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
In the corporate market, the Ford Motor Company sold $500 million of 100-year bonds through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company. The bonds were priced at 98.591 to yield 7.81 percent, or about 85 basis points more than a 30-year Treasury bond.
Rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Duff & Phelps, the bonds are noncallable by the issuer.
The Norfolk Southern Corporation is expected to sell about $3 billion of bonds in four maturities next week.
Analysts said that the company would sell the debt in maturities of 5, 10, 30 and 40 years. The 40-year maturity will have an option that allows the buyer to sell it back to the issuer in seven years.
The proceeds of the debt sale will be used to pay for Norfolk's purchase of 58 percent of Conrail Inc. Last week, the CSX Corporation sold $2.5 billion of bonds to buy 42 percent of Conrail.
Two days ago, Moody's lowered its credit rating on Norfolk one notch to Baa1, its second cut in three months. S.& P. rates Norfolk AA- with a negative outlook.
Merrill Lynch & Company and J. P. Morgan will lead underwriters on the sale.

HEADLINE: Tiny Tribe in Remote Arctic Is Jolting Alaska

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: VENETIE, Alaska

 BODY:
From this log-built bogland village of barely 200 Athabaskan Indian souls, high in the Arctic Circle, deep in the Alaskan interior, a snowball began to roll.
It started small, here on the Chandalar River. In 1987, the tribal leaders of the Native Village of Venetie (pronounced VEEN-ih-tye) asserted their right to tax a contractor who was building a school here. The state fought it. It argues that under the laws governing Alaskan natives, the village's tribal government had authority over its own people, but not the power to tax or regulate their land. 
 Then it got bigger. The case advanced to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which ruled last fall that the natives had the right to tax businesses on their land, about the size of Delaware, because it qualified as "Indian Country," much like the reservations in the lower 48 states.
Now, the challenge that Venetie set into motion has such mammoth implications that the State of Alaska has apportioned $1 million for an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. At stake, alarmed state officials say, is the ability to tax and regulate not only Venetie's territory but also a total of 44 million acres of native-owned land -- or more than a tenth of Alaska. The total area almost rivals the 56 million acres occupied by Indian reservations in the rest of the country.
"We've used the word chaos to describe it," said Bruce Botelho, the Attorney General of Alaska. "This impacts primarily rural Alaska, but you're talking in excess of 200 communities who may have a claim that they're occupying Indian Country."
In their petition to the Supreme Court, which is to decide soon whether to take the case, Mr. Botelho and other officials describe the widespread uncertainty the state has been thrown into and predict a blizzard of litigation over myriad issues.
They include whether state taxes and motor vehicle rules still apply on native lands, whether state hunting, fishing and environmental rules must still be obeyed there and whether thousands of non-natives living there are now subject to tribal laws.
A particularly daunting prospect -- one that lawyers for the natives say is highly unlikely -- is that tribal governments could try to tax oil and gas drilling on their lands as well, state officials say.
"In practically every area of government," the petition asserts, "Alaskans -- native and non-native alike -- must now ask themselves the basic question: who is in charge?"
The people of Venetie, many of them increasingly disillusioned with the state government, have no doubt what the answer should be. They say they are simply asserting their control over land they have inhabited since thousands of years before the Supreme Court existed, the land at the core of their tribe's identity.
"Our forefathers claimed this country and said, 'This is our hunting grounds,' " said Larry Williams, a Venetie laborer. "Everybody knows it's true."
Eddie Frank, another villager, said, "If we don't fight, it's like turning our backs on our ancestors."
But legally, little about the Venetie case is simple. It is complicated both by the knotty laws governing native Americans that have troubled the Federal Government since 1776 and by a social experiment that was uniquely Alaskan: the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act, passed by Congress in 1971 to free up land for the building of the Alaskan oil pipeline.
Under the act, the Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts of Alaska relinquished their aboriginal rights to the land and received nearly $1 billion and title to 44 million acres, with the right to sell and develop the land. That land was transferred to state-chartered native corporations, which have rights like businesses or property owners, rather than governmental powers like taxation and regulation.
The idea was that the corporations would make profits through developing the land and pass on the benefits to the people. But in practice, results have been mixed, with widespread complaints that corporation officials have mismanaged money and taken too much for themselves. The act also created an an unwieldy bureaucracy that aid workers say has often hindered the very development it was meant to encourage.
Despite some economic improvement in the last few decades, many natives, who make up nearly one-fifth of Alaska's population, are still living in poverty, their alienation from state government mounting. They remain far more likely than non-natives to commit suicide, to require government aid and to drop out of school.
Venetie, too, depends partly on welfare and suffers from its remoteness; nearly 150 miles north of Fairbanks on the Yukon Flats, it is not accessible by road or rail, and the village runway remains rough dirt. Food in the village store costs double or triple what it would in Fairbanks, and there is little work to be had but seasonal construction labor.
Villagers say, however, that it has long been a proud place, and part of a proud people, the Gwich'in, who number several thousand and are spread across vast swaths of northeast Alaska into western Canada. Alcohol is banned here, and villagers' yards bear evidence of their labor: drying strips of moose meat, caches holding the thawing bodies of recently trapped foxes, wolves and lynxes, hidebound toboggans and carts for hauling wood.
Now, "We have a window of opportunity and we are trying to open the door to other tribes," said Walter John Jr., a member of the tribal government. "It's time people start talking about their rights."
Villagers, who are backed in the struggle by lawyers from the Native American Rights Fund, said they did not expect much concrete change if the Indian Country ruling stood. Already they are little interfered with by the state, they said. But in this community without zoning and without property lines, where the main rules villagers cite concern age-old requirements to use all of what you kill, they are used to a full freedom that they want to maintain, they said. The tax on the school builder, they said, was both an assertion of their sovereignty and a defensive move to protect the land against any future misuse by the state.
"We want to keep this land clean," said Ernest Erick, a tribal judge, "and protect it and the wildlife and the burying grounds -- these are the backbone of the Gwich'in people."
Back in the labyrinthine corridors of the law, the questions the Supreme Court would have to decide are more arcane than the balancing of freedom and control. In the appeals court ruling last fall, it found that the 1971 Claims Settlement Act did not rule out the possibility of "Indian Country" in Alaska.
That issue, Attorney General Botelho said, would be the crux of the state's argument: that Indian Country has never existed in Alaska and that the settlement act was not intended to change that.
Lawyers on both sides say it is impossible to predict whether the Supreme Court will take the case. If it does not, and the Indian Country decision stands, Alaska's delegation to Congress has said it will try to seek limits on Alaskan tribal sovereignty through legislation. Such a move, however, would risk touching off opposition not only from Alaska's natives but from native Americans around the country.
Rather, Mr. Botelho said, he hopes the state will enter a broad dialogue in an effort to resolve the divisions between native and non-native, rural and urban, divisions that have festered in recent years over such issues as who should get hunting and fishing preferences.
"We can do a lot together as a state government to heal the divisions in the state and the gap in our vision for what Alaska should be," Mr. Botelho said.
Venetie villagers' predict that what comes next will not be nearly so peaceful. So do their lawyers, who also argue that the state is exaggerating the case's potential effect and that at most, 22 million acres could be classified as Indian Country.
"The state has made it very, very clear it will no way, no how accept the notion of tribal power in Alaska," said Heather Kendall-Miller, a lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund. "If dialogue were in fact their interest, that dialogue would be occurring right now."
Regardless of the ultimate legal outcome, Venetie, like the mouse that roared, is proud of the effect it has already had on establishing Native American rights.
"Whether we lose or not," said Mr. Frank, a talented trapper and toboggan maker, "the state will be fighting everyone else now because the Circuit Court decision opened the door for that. Even a small tribe like us of 300 people really rocked the boat for the state, and it scares the heck out of them. It's going to be a long battle."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Choice: Press the Swiss, or Close Books

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May

 BODY:
A half-century ago President Truman faced the question of whether to force Switzerland to disgorge millions in Nazi plunder. In a decision that a Government report concluded on Wednesday was an enormous blunder, he decided that the United States had bigger interests at stake -- rebuilding Europe and fighting Communism -- and settled for token reparations for the victims of Nazism.
Today the Clinton Administration faces an eerily similar choice. While much of the Nazi booty was sold off or returned to German citizens, Switzerland's banks clearly benefited from a large amount of what remained, even if it has since been melted down, traded off, and buried in balance sheets. 
 Now the United States must decide how hard to press Switzerland to pay up, and at what cost to relations with a major trading and financial partner, one that is feeling bruised by the intense scrutiny of an ugly chapter of history.
That question leads to long pauses and clenched teeth here. "It's something we can't answer at this point," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, an Under Secretary of Commerce who headed the 11-agency study that concluded that Switzerland evaded its responsibilities for 50 years and that the United States failed to use the economic leverage it had over the Swiss to force different behavior.
"We haven't excluded any option," Mr. Eizenstat insists, measuring his words with care. "We're not suggesting that what the Swiss have done in recent months is sufficient. It is important that the Swiss and other neutrals have time to absorb these facts, and that we take a look at what action is forthcoming before making any definitive judgments."
Behind Mr. Eizenstat's comments is a debate within the Administration that echoes the disputes that broke out a half-century ago.
Then the Treasury wanted to freeze Swiss assets in the United States and threaten economic sanctions if Switzerland failed to return hundreds of millions of dollars in looted gold, stolen art work, and Nazi industrial properties that were falsely being operated as Swiss firms. It was overruled. The State Department won the day, warning that sanctions were the equivalent of economic war, and that Switzerland would react badly to "being bullied by the greatest power in the world."
Today the divisions are far blurrier. The Treasury, portrayed by Government historians as the hero of the 1946 argument, will not declare publicly whether it will stick to the same hard-line position and be willing to freeze part of the $86 billion in public and private funds that Switzerland invests here. That excludes Swiss investments in factories and other businesses.
But one senior Administration official marveled the other day, "It's the same conversation."
"It's just that 50 years ago we were worried about Nazis and Commies, and now the worry is that we want the Swiss to help root out drug dealers and money launderers. The issues are different but the trade-offs are just the same."
Clearly the Administration is hoping that no such confrontation arises. But if Switzerland fails to pass a national referendum, scheduled for next year, to create a major fund for Holocaust victims, their heirs, and other humanitarian causes, the political pressure to act will clearly rise.
The referendum's failure is a real possibility: Already nationalists in Switzerland are arguing that the United States is attempting to blackmail the Swiss. That echoes comments by the former Swiss president who complained last year that the United States and Britain were using the Nazi gold issue to destroy Switzerland as a financial center.
"On the one hand this report will help the referendum effort because it puts out the facts," said Thomas Borer, Switzerland's envoy on the Nazi gold issue, who is pleading his country's cause here this week. "But over time, it may engender a lot of negative feeling, especially from those who say this is just an attack on Switzerland. When does it stop? When do we say simply that we reached agreement in 1946, and this will not be renegotiated?"
The issue at hand is whether to re-open the 1946 agreement called the "Washington Accord." Under that agreement Switzerland turned over gold worth $58 million (or roughly $564 million at today's prices) to the Allies for distribution to central banks that were looted by the Nazis. But at the time the Swiss held more than $200 million -- some say the figure was closer to $300 million -- in gold that the Nazis had looted as they raced through Europe, then traded to the Swiss for war material. In short, the Swiss paid only a fourth or less of the gold that the report concluded that they knew was stolen goods.
Under the same agreement, Switzerland was supposed to liquidate and turn over to the Allies half of the non-gold assets the Nazis kept in Switzerland, which ranged in value from $250 million to $500 million at the time -- billions by today's measures. But Switzerland never delivered.
Some, led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, declare that the solution is simple: Force Switzerland to pay up now. "We should re-open all of this," he said on Wednesday.
But as a matter of logistics, law and politics, it is not that easy.
Many of the assets have seeped away over years of negotiations. Others were declared "exempt from liquidation" in subsequent negotiations.
The 1952 agreement to accept a token payment from Switzerland was motivated by the sudden urgency of stabilizing the West German economy against encroaching Communist powers.
That may have been "a bad bargain" for Holocaust victims, Mr. Eizenstat noted on Wednesday. "But it is a reminder that we participated in this. We accepted this."
And finally there is the question of alienating a partner, though not a particularly close one. Just a few weeks ago the Clinton Administration decided it would not impose sanctions on Mexico for its failures in cracking down on the drug trade because it feared jeopardizing future cooperation. Switzerland, officials note, has recently become significantly more cooperative in helping track the funds of drug lords and financial criminals.
"This will not be an easy decision," a top State Department official said today. "It was tough in 1946, and it will be tough this time, too."

HEADLINE: After Outcry, Agency Drops Housing Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Facing staunch opposition from public housing tenants and their advocates, the New York City Housing Authority retreated yesterday from a plan to seek a waiver from Federal regulations that restrict the rents it charges, the kind of people it houses and the way it spends huge but shrinking Government subsidies.
The authority, confronting deep cuts in Federal aid and searching for ways to survive an era of austerity, said the waiver from the Department of Housing and Urban Development would have been used experimentally in 16 of the city's 341 housing projects only to train and place welfare tenants in jobs, enabling them eventually to become more self sufficient and pay more rent. 
 Ruben Franco, the authority chairman, insisted that tenant fears that the authority would have used the waiver to raise rents, evict residents or sell, demolish or privatize some projects that house large numbers of impoverished welfare recipients were based on rumor and misinformation.
But he conceded that the plan, which had been strongly supported by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, could not have succeeded without wide tenant support, and he said the authority's three-member board, facing a May 19 Federal deadline, had decided yesterday to abandon the waiver application.
"Our initial interest in applying to participate in this pilot program was to provide greater economic opportunity and security to our most vulnerable residents," Mr. Franco said. "However, in a series of public and private meetings with our residents, I found much anxiety and strong opposition, caused in part by considerable misinformation about the program's purpose and confusion and concern about the deregulation provisions."
Tenant advocates, however, hailed the authority's decision as a victory for the city's 600,000 public housing residents and contended that the waiver would have conferred substantial powers on the authority to raise rents, change the ratio of poor to working-class tenants, remove Federal safeguards and radically change or even abandon its historic mission of providing housing for those with no place else to go.
"The idea that New York City, with the largest public housing program in the country, might seek to deregulate or change the conditions under which hundreds of thousands of people live was very frightening to people," said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society.
As for assertions that misinformation had alarmed tenants, Mr. Jones said the authority had only itself to blame. He said officials had known since last December of HUD's program to relax regulations for up to 30 of the nation's public housing authorities but had failed for months to communicate its intentions to tenants and had held only one public hearing -- last Tuesday night -- only to find wide tenant dissatisfaction with the plan.
"We began asking them in February when they were going to hold hearings to discuss all ramifications of the program," Mr. Jones said. "We never got a response. We think tenants and the entire public have to be involved in this issue. Any changes in this invaluable city asset have to be carefully looked at. They were trying to do it weeks before the deadline, and tenants were not sure what the deal was."
New York's Housing Authority, long the nation's largest and most successful public housing agency, has been hit hard by a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies from Washington in recent years. Moreover, welfare recipients, who make up 30 percent of the city housing residents, face large cuts and an eventual cutoff of aid under federally mandated welfare changes, which will, in turn, make it more difficult for them to pay rent.
Like housing agencies in Boston, Washington, Newark and other cities, the New York authority is grappling to cut costs and take in more revenue to make up for the dwindling Federal subsidies, 90 percent of which come from HUD.
Last December, HUD announced a Moving to Work demonstration project and invited 30 housing authorities from across the nation to apply for waivers from longstanding rules that limit rents, determine the mix of poor and working class residents in projects and restrict the ways that housing authorities spend money and run their projects.
Among other ways to generate money, the waiver would allow housing authorities to turn over some high-rise buildings to private managers, increase the number of tenants with jobs and charge tenants more than 30 percent of their income for rent, requiring only that rents be reasonable. Fixed rents are seen by some as a disincentive to work.
In addition, the waivers would let housing authorities use of their subsidies to establish job-training and placement programs for tenants who are welfare recipients and to provide them with transportation to jobs, day care and other benefits that would help them toward self-sufficiency.
Only the most successful housing authorities were invited to apply, and New York's authority, with a reputation for good management, was widely regarded as having an excellent chance of acceptance. While a March 18 deadline was originally set for the applications, the New York authority did not announce until April 9 that it intended to apply, and HUD put the deadline back to May 19. The city's announcement stirred opposition from some tenant advocacy groups, which expressed fears that the waivers might be misused.
Mr. Franco, in response, said the authority wanted the waiver to help train and place welfare recipients in jobs, saying it would be "something positive for the residents of public housing," and "not negative." He conceded that the authority might try to generate more money for its budget by raising the rents of some tenants who were paying far less than the 30 percent cap.
While residents may have been consulted privately, there was no public hearing until last Tuesday at the Fashion Institute of Technology at Seventh Avenue and 27th Street, where hundreds of angry tenants gathered and denounced the plan and the authority for failing to tell them of its intentions.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Defends Fed's Rate Policy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
Clearly stung by widespread criticism that the Federal Reserve had been too quick to raise interest rates six weeks ago, Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, aggressively defended the action last night, saying that failure to act would have constituted "a threat to the job security and standards of living of too many Americans."
Addressing head-on the argument that the Federal Reserve had put the brakes on the economy without clear evidence of accelerating inflation, Mr. Greenspan offered what for him was an unusually direct rebuttal, saying the quarter-point rate increase on March 25 had been a carefully calibrated form of insurance for an economy that has been growing steadily for more than six years. 
 "The Federal Reserve, of late, has been criticized as being too focused on subduing nonexistent inflation and, in the process, being willing to suppress economic growth, retard job expansion and inhibit real wage gains," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan during an awards dinner of the New York University Stern School of Business. "On the contrary, our actions to tighten money market conditions in 1994, and again in March of this year, were directed at sustaining and fostering growth in economic activity, jobs and real wages."
Mr. Greenspan did not say whether he would push for another rate increase when the Fed meets to consider monetary policy on May 20, although he warned that further rate increase might be necessary if the economy did not slow.
But his speech laid out a rationale for central bankers to take unpopular actions in pursuit of low inflation, especially when, as now, there is no clear political consensus to curb growth before inflation breaks out.
"Those who wish for us, in the current environment, to await clearly visible signs of emerging inflation before acting are recommending we return to a failed regime of monetary policy that cost jobs and living standards," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan's speech comes at a time when policy makers at the Fed, as well as economists generally, are struggling to explain why inflation has remained largely dormant despite a combination of strong growth and low unemployment that traditional theory holds would lead inevitably to rising wages and prices.
The economy grew at a 5.6 percent rate in the first quarter, its fastest pace in more than nine years, and unemployment in April stood at 4.9 percent, its lowest rate in 23 years. Yet wages are rising only modestly -- the Employment Cost Index for the first quarter rose just six-tenths of 1 percent -- and measures of overall inflation have remained subdued.
Mr. Greenspan has consistently advocated the need to fight inflation pre-emptively -- that is, before it infects the economy and becomes much more difficult to root out. But until the Fed's March meeting, Mr. Greenspan held off raising rates the previous year despite periodic surges in growth and a steadily declining unemployment rate.
In raising its target for the Federal funds rate to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent at the March meeting, the Fed took the smallest step it could to keep the economy from overheating. Still, the decision brought widespread complaints from many business executives and from politicians at both ends of the ideological spectrum that the Fed was exaggerating the inflation threat at the cost of jobs and economic growth.
They argued that the Fed had not taken sufficient note of fundamental changes to the economy, from the improvements in productivity generated by investments in technology to increasing global competition, that have combined to allow higher rates of economic growth while keeping wage and pressure increases in check.
"Raising interest rates in a pre-emptive strike against inflation risks damaging our economic growth and prosperity, and is unwarranted," said a letter sent to Mr. Greenspan last month by 59 members of Congress, most of them Democrats.
The rate increase -- or the threat of a protracted rise in rates -- was also cited as a reason for the stock market slump that began in March. The market has recovered sharply from the selloff as economic reports have indicated a moderation of economic growth -- data that have been interpreted by some analysts as making future rate increases less likely.
In his speech last night, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed carefully weighed both the costs of raising interest rates and the risks of not raising rates in deciding when and whether to act against inflation. In the case of the March meeting, he said, the balance tipped toward acting.
"In the same sense that it would be folly not to endure the small immediate discomfort of a vaccination against the possibility of getting a serious disease, it would have been folly not to take this small prudent step last March to reduce the probabilities that destabilizing inflation would re-emerge," Mr. Greenspan said. "The risk to the economy from inaction came to outweigh the risk from action."
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that there is a "substantial element of truth" in the argument that "conventional notions of capacity are becoming increasingly outmoded, and that domestic resources can be used much more intensively than in the past without added price pressures."
But he went on to say that "any inference that our productive capacity is essentially unlimited is clearly unwarranted."
Mr. Greenspan said that while there is "scant evidence of any imminent resurgence of inflation at the moment, there also appears to be little slack in our capacity to produce."
In the closest he came to a warning that the Fed might have to raise rates again this month, he added, "Should the expected slowing in the growth of demand fail to materialize, we would need to address any emerging pressures in product and credit markets."

HEADLINE: White House and Senate Clash On a Cash-Poor Loan Program

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
The White House has refused to give a Senate committee three documents on a popular small-business loan program that is running short of money, and Republicans responded today by accusing the Administration of simply trying to avoid political embarrassment.
Administration officials said the documents were memorandums to President Clinton or senior White House aides about problems with the loan program. They said the White House was holding on to them solely to protect the confidentiality of its decision-making process. 
 The fight over the documents comes at a time when Republican Congressional leaders have also complained that the White House is trying to hold back crucial records from House investigators examining Democratic fund-raising practices.
Republican senators maintained today that the Administration was using similar tactics in the unrelated tiff over who is to blame for a shortage in the lending program, which guarantees the repayment of commercial loans to small businesses.
The Senate Committee on Small Business asked for the documents after the Small Business Administration announced last month that it would lower the limit on the size of the loan guarantees to $500,000 from $1 million to keep the program from running out of money before the Government's fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.
Bankers and other lenders have asked both the Administration and Congress to find an additional $43 million to enable the agency to guarantee about $9 billion in loans this year.
Given the drive to eliminate the Federal budget deficit, any extra money would be hard to find, although neither Congress nor the White House wants to seem responsible for turning borrowers away from a program that both parties have hailed as a way to create jobs and nurture fledging businesses.
Administration officials said the problem had cropped up because Congress had slashed their original request for enough money to guarantee $11 billion in loans this year.
But the White House itself has decided not to push now for any extra money, which it could get only by cutting other programs.
Senator Christopher S. Bond, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, said Administration officials had failed to warn Congress about the shortage soon enough for lawmakers to find the money needed to meet the soaring loan demand.
Officials at the Small Business Administration denied that, but Senator Bond said he had "serious concerns" about their candor.

HEADLINE: Bruce Willis Drops Project, Leaving Town More Troubled

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: PENNS GROVE, N.J., May 8

 BODY:
While thousands of fans waited to catch a glimpse of the actor Bruce Willis as he opened a Planet Hollywood in France today, residents here in his hometown could talk of little but how he had just let them down.
Just two years ago, a mystery buyer spent $1 million on waterfront acreage in this tiny, hard-pressed borough, raising hopes and curiosity. The curiosity was satisfied: the buyer was Mr. Willis's company, Screwball Inc. 
 And the hopes grew. Mr. Willis had plans, big plans: a $50 million riverfront development to include a marina, a large cinema, a 90-room hotel, shops and much more.
But today, borough officials confirmed that the dream was dead: the actor had lost interest and planned to put the land up for sale.
Mr. Willis could not be reached today. He was at the Cannes Film Festival, which opened with a screening of his latest film, Luc Bresson's futuristic action movie "The Fifth Element."
But Stephen R. Spector, a lawyer for Screwball, said that company executives had told him that "the project is not proceeding."
"I can't believe he did this," said Carol Evans, 24, as she stopped to talk to a visitor in front of the red brick post office. "I was all excited that jobs would open up."
Like many people here, she said she was confused by Mr. Willis's abandonment. And she said she felt he was also abandoning his roots. "I want to know why," she said. "Why did he say, 'I'll forget where I came from?' "
Mr. Willis spent about $1 million in 1995 to buy 11 acres along the Delaware River and said that he planned to build on it. Mr. Willis's developers planned to draw thousands of people here, where the dozens of boarded up buildings and "for sale" signs are clues to its official distinction as the state's second most economically distressed municipality after Newark.
Today, the borough solicitor pulled Mr. Willis's development plans out of a cardboard box stored behind some chairs in the town's small courtroom. "They're now just old news."
"We're disappointed, but we want to stay positive," said the solicitor, Anthony J. Crescenzi. "A lot of people think there's a chance that he might change his mind."
Added Mayor Paul J. Morris, "We will see that property developed one way or another."
But the borough now has no prospective buyers for the land, most of which is a grassy, trash-strewn lot with a stunning view of the Delaware Memorial Bridge leading to Wilmington and a not-so-nice view of a rusted Delaware power plant.
Since the actor announced his plans, real estate prices have crept up and new businesses have opened in anticipation of the thousands of new visitors. Some residents near the property have found tourists in their front yards taking photographs of the "land that Bruce bought."
But some people here said today that they were not surprised that Mr. Willis had decided to pull out. They had watched for any sign of activity on the property and, so far, the only renovations had been to a huge gray stone house where Mr. Willis's father now lives.
"I just couldn't see it," said Adele Stalcup, who runs Bancos Deli at the foot of the weed-covered pier that Mr. Willis planned to rebuild so that a ferry could stop there. "The scale was all wrong. You can't take a $52 million development and plunk it into a nine-tenths of a one-square-mile town."
Jim Bundy, who was fishing today on the banks of the Delaware on Mr. Willis's property, was a little more bitter. "It had to happen," he said of the actor's decision to leave. "Good things don't happen here."
Indeed, the unemployment rate in Penns Grove is about 15 percent -- almost three times the current statewide rate of 5.5 percent. The borough's economy has been in a tailspin ever since the Du Pont chemical plant in neighboring Carneys Point began laying off blue-collar workers decades ago. The population is now about 4,800, down from 5,200 in 1990.
The project needed approval from both Penns Grove and the state of Delaware, since the state line runs along the low tide mark of the New Jersey bank of the river, and Mr. Willis's marina and pier would have been on the Delaware side.
Mr. Willis had started making a film, "The Broadway Brawler," in Wilmington earlier this year, a move that some of Penns Grove's residents said they believed was meant to win that city's support. But the filming was halted almost immediately because the producer and director left.
In early 1996, Mr. Willis met with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, leaving his limousine in front of the New Jersey State House while they discussed his plan. Pete McDonough, the Governor's press secretary, said Mrs. Whitman took the opportunity to tell Mr. Willis that she would do all she could to help insure that the project stayed on course and that the state and local government would cooperate to make the project a reality.
Yesterday, Mr. McDonough said, Mrs. Whitman was "disappointed that Mr. Willis has made a decision not to pursue the project and hopes that he will reconsider."
Mr. Willis grew up in Carneys Point, attended Penns Grove High School and even worked in one of the Du Pont factories before he found fame on the television series "Moonlighting" and through his "Die Hard" films.
Borough officials said today that Mr. Willis had stressed to them early in the project that his hope was to create jobs. The development company planned to hire local people and firms to do much of the work, Mr. Crescenzi said.
But while some business people said they were certain that the town could turn itself around with or without Mr. Willis, others were not so sure.
At Bobby's Place, a small supermarket that opened across from Mr. Willis's property last year, the owner, Christine Kern, said this afternoon that she may soon close up shop. Not a customer was in the store, despite the smell of Ms. Kerns fresh-baked doughnuts.
"I won't be able to stay here," Ms. Kern said. "There's not enough money to pay the bills."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S BUDGET PLAN: ALBANY;
A Familiar Complaint For an Election Year

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
After four years of relative silence on the subject, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani unleashed a surprisingly pointed attack yesterday on the many ways in which the state shortchanges the city, placing a demand for fairness at the very heart of his election-year budget.
Although he has occasionally taken Albany to task before, the Mayor for the first time actually began to echo the ancient cry of his predecessors, railing at the state's failure to give the city its fair share of money for education, transportation, health care and welfare. He was particularly critical of Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to recalculate the state's property tax formula, claiming it fails to recognize the city's importance to the rest of the state. 
 And, just two years after asking state legislators for less welfare and Medicaid money -- which would have allowed him to cut the city's share of spending in those areas -- he complained yesterday that the Governor plans to keep hundreds of millions of Federal dollars provided by the new welfare law, which the Mayor believes is due the city.
Mr. Giuliani's oratorical turnabout was the most striking element of his annual budget presentation, constituting a substantial portion of his speech to city officials and reporters, and aides said it was deliberately highlighted to convey the Mayor's growing irritation with spending formulas that he contends are tilted against the city. The speech was accompanied by eight charts on the subject, with titles like "Historical Inequity of New York City Share of State Education Aid," showing how the city loses more than $4 billion a year to a series of such imbalances.
"I want to make a very strong argument for our share of tax revenues," he said when asked about his new direction. "And I think it's important to put out on the agenda precisely how much we contribute to the economy of the state and areas in which we're not getting back our proportionate share."
Most of these inequities, of course, have existed for years, and Mr. Giuliani has until now chosen to suppress his frustration. His decision to speak out about them now, a few months before the end of his term and in a re-election year, reflects a series of calculations, some political, some purely practical.
At one level, the Mayor has been under attack by his political opponents for failing to achieve more in Albany, particularly after his decision in 1995 to ask for less. Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President and a candidate for mayor, said yesterday it was a bit late for Mr. Giuliani suddenly to begin requesting more money from the state.
"I'm glad that in the last six months of his term in office he has come to realize the gross inequities around which he ought to have been organizing coalitions," she said. "That ought to have been one of the first points in his annual Albany lobbying trips." Whatever dim memories a few voters may have of the 1995 incident, Mr. Giuliani will now be in a position to drown them out with a never-fail populist roar against the state capital.
The timing is also in his favor. The Mayor had to spend several years in the wilderness after endorsing Mr. Pataki's Democratic opponent in 1994, Mario M. Cuomo; he clearly felt constrained about pushing his relationship with the Republican Governor by asking him to rewrite the state's political rules in New York City's favor.
Now that he is in a sturdier political position, Mr. Giuliani is apparently willing to assume a few risks, particularly at a time when the Governor is himself beginning to consider re-election and is thus more concerned about his image in the city, aides said.
With the state enjoying a surplus of $1 billion to $2 billion, the Mayor is urging the Governor to revise his proposal to reduce state property taxes paid to schools. The Giuliani administration contends that the Governor's plan would primarily benefit rural and suburban areas, because city schools do not rely on property taxes as much as schools elsewhere in the state. He also said that the state plans to keep far too much of the $730 million in surplus Federal money flowing from the new welfare law, and that it should return three or four times as much to cities and counties around the state.
"It is natural that there would be the difference of opinion, because when you run a city, you focus on the needs of the city, and when you run a state you have to look at the entire state," the Mayor said. "I don't expect that we are going to cure every one of these, but I think that they offer perspective on why we should be getting more than 12 percent of the tax relief that is being given out all over the state. New York City is the engine that drives the entire economy of the state."
For good measure, the Mayor threw in assorted complaints about the benefits of the Port Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and he noted that New York State was one of only two states that require localities to split the costs of Medicare with them.
The Pataki administration seemed to know what was coming, having issued a news release on Wednesday defending its generosity to the city. Yesterday, the Governor said that critics should consider the impact of programs on the entire state.
"If we do it that way," he said at a Manhattan appearance, "if we stop 'upstate, downstate,' if we stop the suburbs against the city and recognize that we all do well if all parts of the state do well and we have to do what's right for all parts of the state, then we're going to continue to do very well as a state."
The Mayor, however, has the luxury of being concerned only with downstate voters. Although his aides had recently been boasting about their success using a new approach in Albany, the Mayor's sudden turn seems to indicate that the old songs still sound best in an election year.

HEADLINE: In Victory for U.S., Europe Ban On Treated Beef Is Ruled Illegal

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 8

 BODY:
The European Union's ban on hormone-treated beef is illegal, a panel of the World Trade Organization has decided, potentially giving the American cattle industry a big victory but also turning over new ground on issues of national sovereignty.
In a preliminary report, which has not yet been released to the public, the organization says that Europe's import ban on beef produced with growth-enhancing hormones is illegal because it has no scientific justification, according to American officials who have seen it. 
 If it is upheld, and experts on both sides said they believed that it would be, it is likely to set an important precedent for attacking scores of other trade barriers -- from Japanese certification of apples to European rules for poultry inspection -- that are based on health concerns.
The effects of the decision may not be directly felt because, through negotiation, the Europeans might be able to keep the ban, which has wide popular support, by making trade-offs in other areas. But it nonetheless reinforces the shift in emphasis toward international trade law and away from traditional unilateral decisions or bilateral trade agreements, even when internal policies are at stake.
And a ruling by the trade organization could someday cut the other way as well, calling on the United States to drop health or environmental regulations that have broad popular appeal but that do not pass scientific muster in an international tribunal. It was that very possibility that galvanized some American conservatives to campaign against the formation of the group three years ago, contending that the organization would imperil American sovereignty by subjecting United States regulations to a group consisting of representatives of more than 100 other countries.
Unlike many import restrictions, the European ban on hormone-treated beef was not erected to protect local farmers but rather to assuage widespread popular angst among European consumers over chemicals in food and it applies equally to European and non-European farmers. The United States was joined in its complaint by several other big beef producers -- Argentina, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- that also use growth hormones.
The issue before the three-member panel of the World Trade Organization was whether the beef ban, which was enacted in 1988, was grounded on any scientific evidence that the use of hormones might endanger health. American farmers routinely use five hormones, including progesterone and testosterone, to make cattle grow faster and produce more milk.
The overwhelming consensus among scientific experts was that there is no such evidence, and the five hormones used by American farmers were specifically approved by a standards-setting body within the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
United States Government officials who have seen the 60-page ruling by the trade panel said it firmly concluded that the European Union failed to satisfy the new standard for trade restrictions based on health.
"From our analysis, the preliminary decision comes down squarely on our side, based on the issue that food safety criteria have to be grounded on the basis of scientific principles," said one official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified.
European experts and diplomats said they were not surprised by the ruling, which was delivered to both sides shortly after midnight this morning in Geneva. The scientific consensus was simply too clear, they said.
Nonetheless, the ban on hormone-treated beef is grounded in powerful popular suspicions across much of Europe about chemical additives in food. European news media are full of reports about the decline in male fertility rates, with much of the speculation focusing on chemicals that people are absorbing from their environments. European foods routinely use fewer preservatives than American foods.
And when news reports periodically appear that cattle farmers in one country or another have been illegally using hormones, the reports generate angry popular outbursts and sometimes lead to brief but noticeable declines in beef consumption.
The issue of meat safety has become even more sensitive for Europeans in the last year, because of the furor over British cattle infected with "mad cow disease." Fear of contaminated beef prompted other countries in the European Union to block imports of British meat, igniting a bitter trade battle between Britain and the rest of Europe.
Today's decision is the first involving the agreement that restrictions based on health and safety of food products must be based on scientific evidence that they protect human health.
"The trouble with the W.T.O. agreement is that it does not provide for any measures that are based on consumer concerns," said Stefan Tangermann, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Gottingen in Germany. "It only provides for measures that are based on scientific concerns."
The ruling could also have a direct bearing on potential disputes in the future over genetically engineered crops, which raise some of the same political issues as hormone-treated beef. American companies are already marketing genetically altered corn that resists root worms and soybeans that are impervious to powerful pesticides, and both products have already generated intense political opposition in some European quarters.
The decision on the beef rules is almost certain to ignite a backlash among consumer groups and political leaders in much of Europe. The United States and the European Union both have one month to review the report and press for changes, but experts on both sides say the final decision is not likely to differ much from the preliminary report.
The issue is so sensitive, in fact, that European officials in Brussels have suggested they might well prefer to pay compensation to the United States rather than lift the ban, in the event that they ultimately lost the legal fight.
Many experts on both sides of the Atlantic said today that they expected the Europeans to seek some sort of negotiated solution that would allow them to keep their ban intact. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, a country can choose to maintain its restriction if it gives up something of comparable value -- by cutting tariffs on other products, for example.
The actual volume of American beef exports to Europe is relatively small -- about $250 million, or about 10 percent of America's total beef exports -- cattle industry executives say.
These executives expressed concerns today that their legal victory might not translate into practical benefits, if the European Union tried to negotiate an alternative to dropping the hormone prohibition.
"We do not feel that having the European Union pay compensation is an acceptable alternative," said Mark Armentrout, head of the international markets committee of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the owner of Mill Park Feedlot in Oakland, Iowa.
Mr. Armentrout said his association would be willing to accept requirements that beef be labeled as an American product, but he balked at using labels that would get into the subject of hormones.
"We are not willing to have some label that portrays it in a negative light," he said. "But in there somewhere there is room for negotiation."
European Union officials could not be reached today, because it is a holiday in Belgium, where the European Commission is based.
The United States and the European Union both have an opportunity to make comments about the preliminary report, and a final version will be issued in about a month. The European Union can then appeal to the World Trade Organization, but the organization's rules require that the report be approved unless there is a unanimous vote against doing so.
Since it was established, the World Trade Organization has become a very successful forum for the United States to vent its trade disputes. The United States has brought 25 complaints to the Geneva-based organization. Of those, four have been decided, all in favor of the United States.
The most recent was a preliminary decision last month against the European Union's restrictions on banana imports, which favor former European colonies and have been fought for years by American companies like Chiquita Brands International that own banana plantations in Central and South America.
But United States regulations have also come under attack from abroad. The same principle at stake in today's decision on beef -- the validity of internal health rules -- has been invoked in at least one instance, a pending case brought by several Southeast Asian nations. These countries, which include Malaysia and Indonesia, have filed complaints with the trade organization against American restrictions on shrimp that have been harvested in ways that do not meet United States environmental regulations.
And in a similar case, in June 1996, the United States agreed in a complaint brought by Venezuela and Brazil to change how it applies environmental rules to imported gasoline.

Since the World Trade Organization was established in 1994, the United States has brought 25 complaints against other nations' foreign trade restrictions. Four have been decided by the W.T.O. panels so far, all in the last six months and all in favor of the United States.
 
DATE: Dec. 1996
TRADING PARTNER: Japan
RULING ON TRAE PRACTICE: Against taxes on imported liquors.
 
DATE: Feb. 1997
TRADING PARTNER: Canada
RULING ON TRAE PRACTICE: Against postal rates for magazines that were higher on American magazines than on Canadian publications.
 
DATE: April 1997
TRADING PARTNER: European Union
RULING ON TRAE PRACTICE: Against a system of tariff preferences for bananas produced in former European colonies, which put American companies that produced bananas in Central and South America at a disadvantage.
 
DATE: May 1997:
TRADING PARTNER: European Union
RULING ON TRAE PRACTICE: Against rules prohibiting imports of beef and beef products from cattle treated with any of five hormones widely used in the United States but not in Europe. The W.T.O. held that the claimed health and safety purpose of the rules had no scientific basis.
 
Five other cases have reached negotiation settlements without a panel ruling, and a sixth, concerning a movie box office tax in Turkey, is considered to be near settlement. Seven are pending before W.T.O. panels and nine are in early stages of settlement discussions.
 
Complaints against the United States
Other countries have lodged 10 complaints against against the United States since 1994, three of which were later suspended or withdrawn. In three cases, concerning garment imports and environmental standards for gasoline, W.T.O. panels have rules against the United States, and a fouth case was settled on similar lines. A dispute over American environmental rules that keep out shrimp from some Southeast Asian countries is pending before a panel. The remaining two cases are in early settlement talks.

HEADLINE: In America;
President Houdini

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Don't ever bet against him. Bill Clinton appears to spend most of his time being pummeled by scandals and other problems. He seems always on the verge of being punched out politically. And then, somehow, to the amazement of his friends and the consternation of his enemies (or vice versa), he comes off the ropes to fashion some dazzling new triumph.
If he were really a boxer, the nickname stitched across his robe would be Houdini. 
 Mr. Clinton's latest big win is the bipartisan agreement to (allegedly) balance the budget by the year 2002. "A balanced budget with balanced values," said Mr. Clinton, which is a really peculiar notion when you think about it. Balanced values. (I imagine a kind of ethical free-trade zone in which people are encouraged to swap some of the things in which they have long believed. It's a concept most easily grasped by those who believe in nothing.)
In any event, the budget agreement was announced on Friday, and when you looked at Saturday's papers you saw that it was part of an extraordinary constellation of good economic news, at least for the short term. The economy was still expanding, inflation was still in hiding, the stock markets were still rising and the official unemployment rate had dropped to an astonishing 24-year low. Economists who had spent years insisting the sky would fall if the jobless rate dipped below 6 percent suddenly found themselves disoriented. Some took to their beds. Others thought the 4.9 percent figure in Saturday's papers was a misprint.
Bill Clinton had come off the ropes with a vengeance.
That's the good news. The bad news has to do with the regressive parlay in the ballyhooed budget agreement -- permanent tax cuts skewed to the rich that inevitably will blow huge holes in future budgets, and the continued willingness of cynical politicians to load the nation's sacrifices onto the backs of those who have the least.
As Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put it: "The problem is the juxtaposition of things like a 10 percent real reduction in the non-defense discretionary part of the budget alongside these big tax cuts for the wealthy. Budget cuts that might be reasonable as part of an everybody-shares-the-pain-for-the-long-term-good package are pretty hard to justify when not only is there no pain at the top, but there are windfall tax cuts."
Mr. Greenstein noted that if you looked ahead just a few years, to 2008 and beyond, the steadily increasing impact of the tax cuts would mean a net revenue loss of $400 billion to $500 billion a year. And that will be happening at the same time that the baby boom vanguard begins filling out its retirement forms. Try to imagine the budget cuts that will be needed then to bring Federal revenues and expenditures anywhere near a balance.
Americans in the second decade of the 21st century will not be happy when they look back at Houdini and his bipartisan budget balancers.
Meanwhile, Senator Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat from Minnesota, has decided that the time to get indignant is now. Mr. Wellstone suffers from the belief that there should be limits to the extremes of hypocrisy to which politicians will go.
He noted (as just one example) that he and other Democrats have been complaining loudly about the dilapidated condition of so many of the nation's public schools. "We were going to take a stand on this," he said.
But when the budget agreement was announced, a very modest $5 billion proposal to help renovate schools was gone. "Knocked out," said Mr. Wellstone ruefully. "It was abandoned."
Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of tax cuts was doable, but not $5 billion to renovate rotting schools.
That kind of betrayal of the interests of the very young and the politically weak is typical of the budget process, the Senator said. "It's deficit reduction based on the path of least political resistance."
He urged his colleagues to at least be honest about what they were doing. "Let's not have any more photo opportunities next to small children," he said. "We all love children in the abstract but we're not willing to invest in the resources they need. It's symbolic politics at its worst."

HEADLINE: Mr. Giuliani's Budget Challenge

 BODY:
The $34 billion budget proposed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani yesterday asked for little change in the way New York City's government runs and little sacrifice from New Yorkers. That is because the city, like the Federal and state governments, is rolling in cash from an improved economy, especially on Wall Street, and has no need for the austerity pushed by the Mayor when he first took office. Nevertheless, he is missing a rare opportunity to put the city's long-term finances in balance.
In one area, the Mayor did throw down the gauntlet. He demanded that Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature use their own surpluses to provide more equitable state funding for the city. His arguments deserve attention in Albany. 
 The case for greater equity lay in the Mayor's complaint that New York City contributes 45.4 percent of the state's revenues and has 38 percent of the state's schoolchildren but receives far less than that proportion in school aid and other programs. Mr. Pataki has promised to rectify the school aid formula but is putting it off. Moreover, Mr. Pataki's plan for property tax relief is still skewed heavily against the city.
The response in Albany has always been that whereas the city receives less than its fair share of school aid and other programs, it receives most of the state's money for welfare and Medicaid. But that is because the city's population is poor, and these programs go to individual recipients, not to the city at large. Running comfortably ahead in his own re-election campaign, Mr. Giuliani can afford to expend some political capital on making his best case in Albany. The timing is good, since the Governor and the Legislature are wrangling right now over how to spend billions of dollars that have turned up since Mr. Pataki presented his own budget in January.
As for the Mayor's budget itself, little is different from the plan he presented in January, except that an optimistic picture on revenues has become even more optimistic. Good economic times have given the Mayor over $1 billion more to play with than he anticipated last year. He has not used this money wisely. For the most part, the money is going for recurring expenses that will remain in the budget long after the current surplus is used up, leaving wide budget gaps in the future. The city might better use the money to retire some of the debt that has been squeezing the budget for years.
When times are good, prudent management would dictate relying less on gimmicks to balance the budget. Instead, Mr. Giuliani is using more gimmicks than ever -- one-shot revenues, asset sales, refinancing of debt -- to pay for ongoing expenses. Moreover, many of those expenses include wage increases and tax cuts that grow in the years ahead, so that the city will never escape from multibillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see.
Mr. Giuliani's priorities are not the problem, though the City Council should look carefully to see if some funding for libraries, cultural institutions and children's services needs to be added. The problem is that the Mayor is throwing everything he can into crowd-pleasing initiatives like tax cuts and more spending on sanitation and police rather than looking ruthlessly to save money in the delivery of services. The Mayor's tough and innovative approach in cutting costs in his first three years has been abandoned now that he is positioning himself for re-election. He can boast of many achievements, but this year he could have done better.

HEADLINE: White House Aide Pushed Plan Benefiting Chinese Shipping Concern

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8

 BODY:
During a tough battle last year over how a closed Navy base in Long Beach, Calif., would be used, a Clinton Administration official made what several people involved describe as highly unusual telephone calls to push for construction there of a container terminal that would be leased to a shipping company owned by the Chinese Government.
The calls were made last November to public officials interested in preserving some historic buildings at the old base, and their disclosure coincides with Federal investigations of whether the Chinese Government tried to make contributions to the Democratic Party last year. 
 The White House official who made the calls, Dorothy Robyn, a member of the National Economic Council, denied in an interview that she had been trying to exert any undue influence over the fate of what had been a major Navy base.
She said that her calls had been made at the request of the Mayor of Long Beach, that they had been intended merely to support the creation of new jobs in an area hit hard by Pentagon cutbacks and that she had never spoken about the project to the shipping concern, the China Ocean Shipping Company, or Cosco.
In the calls, Ms. Robyn urged the preservation officials -- from the Navy, the state and the local government -- to abandon efforts to save any buildings at the base and to allow them to be razed quickly, and the new terminal constructed. Some of those officials had been arguing that Long Beach ought to consider using some buildings for schools, recreation centers or other public uses.
There is no evidence that there was anything improper about the calls, but several officials who received them said it was highly unusual for the White House to intervene on behalf of one side in a local battle like this one, especially when the intervention benefited the cause of a business concern.
Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said earlier this week that the F.B.I. was conducting "a very extensive investigation" into whether the Chinese Government tried to buy influence in last year's elections. While Cosco has not been implicated in the investigation, Hongye Zheng, a senior Chinese Government official who advises the company, attended one of President Clinton's Saturday morning radio broadcasts at the White House last year, as part of a group organized by Johnny Chung.
Mr. Chung is a Chinese-American businessman in Los Angeles who raised $391,000 for the Democratic Party in the last election cycle and enjoyed unusual access to the White House. The propriety of some of those donations is now one subject of the Federal investigation.
Despite the Clinton Administration's push at Long Beach, the plan to pave over the 145-acre base remains stalled because of a court battle between the city and the Long Beach Port Commission, which favor the terminal, and private preservation groups, which oppose it. Several weeks ago a state judge ordered Long Beach to cancel its contract with Cosco and reconsider competing plans for the location, but the Port Commission voted again shortly afterward in favor of the terminal.
As part of the Federal base-closing program, the Government typically cleans up old bases and then hands them over to local governments after they are reviewed for their historical value, and after re-use plans are adopted by the local community.
The Long Beach city preservation officer, the California state preservation officer and a Navy preservation officer have already signed off on the destruction of the buildings at the former Long Beach Naval Station, and officials at the United States Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, who must also review such decisions, appear likely to give their approval soon.
But several of those officials said the White House pressure had been unprecedented.
"We'd never had a phone call like that in this office before," said Lee Keatinge of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. "There's no base re-use fight that's come close to Long Beach" for that kind of high-level involvement.
Ruthann Lehrer, Long Beach's preservation official, said: "It was made clear that this container terminal plan was the preference of the White House, not any of the other ideas some people were talking about. This was clearly not something that the White House wanted studied further."
Twenty-nine bases in California have been closed or cut back since 1988, and Long Beach has suffered huge job losses because of the naval base closing and layoffs at several large aerospace plants. The city has said it is pushing for the container terminal because it would create as many as 600 jobs.
The key telephone call occurred the day before the election last November. Ms. Robyn (pronounced ROH-bine) addressed about eight of the people involved in the Long Beach battle and said, as several participants in the conference call remember it, "I think this Administration has been very supportive of historic preservation, but in this case the national interest would be best served if this re-use plan proceeds."
Ms. Robyn called some of the officials two days later and reiterated that the national interest -- the creation of jobs -- demanded that the base be used as a shipping terminal and that the issue be closed quickly.
"I participated in a conference call at the Mayor's request and stated what the Administration's position was," Ms. Robyn recalled. "We said we support the community's re-use plan." That Cosco was the prospective tenant of the terminal was "totally irrelevant," she said, adding that she had had no contact with the company.
Ms. Robyn said she had been involved in such base closings before, but always to push a slow-moving Navy bureaucracy to hand over the sites quickly. She acknowledged that this was the first time she had stepped in when a community was divided over a re-use plan, and when intervention effectively favored one side over the other.
Cosco already operates from an 80-acre terminal at Long Beach's commercial port. Under the plan for the old naval base, the Port Commission would spend $200 million razing the existing structures and building the terminal. Cosco would pay about $14.5 million a year to lease the terminal, which would be used to accommodate a new generation of larger vessel that the company has started sailing.

HEADLINE: Westlake Journal;
A Perot Comes to Town But Then Leaves With It

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

 BODY:
For four years, Ross Perot Jr., son of the two-time Presidential candidate and a multimillionaire in his own right, has owned more than half the land in tiny, once peaceful Westlake, Tex., just north of Dallas and Fort Worth.
Now he has seceded. Along with him have gone the 2,500 acres on which he plans to build offices, housing and golf courses. And most members of Westlake's governing body, the Board of Aldermen, have seceded with their land, too, leaving the town of 250 residents torn to pieces. 
 "You've got a town where everyone is at everyone else's throats," said Pete Geren, a spokesman for Mr. Perot's development company and a former United States representative from Texas. "There are irreconcilable differences here."
The marriage between Mr. Perot and the town of Westlake seemed promising at the start. When he bought the Circle T Ranch in 1993 from the oilman Nelson Bunker Hunt, who was forced to sell it at the bargain price of $20 million after going bankrupt, residents rejoiced that a man with deep pockets had become the owner of 60 percent of the land within Westlake's borders.
"We wanted Perot here because he had the money and the forethought and the planning," said Don Gardner, a three-year resident.
Mr. Perot owns 25,000 acres throughout the United States, and he heads the industrial cargo park at Fort Worth's Alliance Airport, just a few miles from the edge of the Circle T. Cattle are still being raised on the property, which is also home to a herd of bison.
Mr. Perot, residents figured, would bring investment and, by attracting new residents, additional revenue, too, just as he had done elsewhere.
"But then," Mr. Gardner said, "we realized he wanted to use our money to build."
Mr. Perot had pledged he would not saddle Westlake with extra taxes. The ranch property, Mr. Perot's representatives pointed out, contained three municipality districts authorized to sell bonds, and thus could finance its own development.
As outlined by Mr. Perot's representatives, new businesses and residents on the Circle T property could have water, electricity and road improvements financed by bonds sold by the districts. The bonds would be paid off with special taxes assessed on the property owners.
But longtime residents of Westlake feared they would have to pay taxes, too, if newcomers later took control of the Board of Aldermen and sought to spread the burden.
The aldermen seemed to share residents' concerns. But after a transaction last December, residents were no longer sure the aldermen were on their side. In that deal, Mr. Perot bought an additional 500 acres from the Hunt family trust, on which an alderman lived. He paid a reported $10 million for the property, to go with the 2,000 acres he already had.
In a matter of months, four of the five alderman publicly backed Mr. Perot's financing plan, saying that they trusted him to deal in good faith. Many residents noted that the interests of the four aldermen were merging with those of Mr. Perot.
Were other town leaders, residents asked, hoping to sell their land for a princely sum to Mr. Perot? The Mayor, Scott Bradley, said Mr. Perot had offered to buy his property, which Mr. Perot's spokesman confirmed. The offer was rejected. Suspicions deepened. And the town split.
One man who had publicly questioned whether Mr. Perot's plans were in the town's best interests was Don Redding, a retired executive with International Business Machines and a member of the Planning and Zoning Board. In February, he declared that he would run for alderman himself. His candidacy did not last long. Four of the five aldermen voted to declare that Mr. Redding's neighborhood of 64 residents, Stagecoach Hills, had never actually fallen within the town's borders, denying him the right to run for office.
From then on, tensions between pro-Perot and anti-Perot forces worsened. Town meetings were shouting matches, with residents challenging and ridiculing board members. Government was in gridlock. It was a startling turnabout in a place where politics had been so dull that only 21 people showed up to vote in the town election last year.
Early this month, the board, on a vote of 4 to 1, dismissed Mr. Bradley as Mayor. Mr. Bradley, a former assistant district attorney in Dallas, had been a persistent critic of Mr. Perot's plans. In invoking legal provisions that permitted the Mayor's removal for incompetence, the aldermen cited problems with the board's minutes and with scheduling.
And there was another problem: Mr. Bradley had opposed the aldermen's move to prohibit Mr. Redding's candidacy.
"He behaved in a manner unacceptable to anyone else," Al Oien, an alderman and Perot supporter, said after the Mayor's ouster.
Even as Mr. Bradley was being ousted, Mr. Perot requested that the Circle T ranch be excluded from the town's boundaries. Three aldermen, blaming incessant fighting and facing an election in which pro-Perot forces were likely to lose their board majority, requested secession for land they owned, a total of 169 acres, adjacent to the Perot property.
Eleven other residents, with a total of 95 acres, broke away, too, complaining they were tired of the political fighting and the government's telling them what to do.
"This is about classic small-town governance issues," Mr. Perot said in a recent interview. "The founders of the city want to be left alone; they want to live their lives in peace."
That was the situation when 120 residents gathered in a meeting room adjacent to city hall, atop a day-care center in an office center, to watch most of the 41-year-old town's political leaders and its leading landowner secede, or, in the words of Texas, take part in a "disannexation." It had simply required a public posting of the landowners' intentions 72 hours in advance of the meeting, in addition to a majority vote of the aldermen and that of the Mayor. On the day of the secession vote, the board voted 4 to 1 to appoint a new mayor, Dale White, who is retired. With his support, the secession was a foregone conclusion. Mr. White's 22 acres were among those disannexed.
Some residents wept.
Mr. Bradley, the ousted Mayor, has vowed to fight, with the goal of putting the little town back together. He says he will challenge his dismissal in court.
For now, with Westlake a third the size it was last month, many residents feel betrayed by Mr. Perot. "We all went with him because we thought, 'This is Ross Perot, and he's going to do good,' " Mr. Gardner said. "But we found out the big boys play hard."
The day after the secession, the Fort Worth City Council voted to include Mr. Perot's property in its extraterritorial jurisdiction, which means that the city could make the land part of the city. Becoming part of Fort Worth, said Mr. Perot's spokesman, Mr. Geren, would open several options for financing development.

HEADLINE: Clinton, at Costa Rica Talks, Gives Pledge on Immigrants

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, May 8

 BODY:
After meeting here today with the leaders of seven Central American and Caribbean nations, President Clinton said he would seek to blunt a new law to restrict illegal immigration and compel deportations.
Mr. Clinton defended the thrust of the law, but said he would suspend one provision until Oct. 1 while he tries to persuade Congress to amend it. Administration officials said the President did not respond to a proposal by President Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador that he seek an amnesty proposed for some of the immigrants from this region. 
 At a summit meeting today intended to underscore the economic potential of this newly democratic region, Central American leaders laid out their concerns about the legislation. Mr. Clinton signed it last September during the Presidential election campaign, when illegal immigration emerged as a major issue.
The leaders said they feared the law would compel the return of hundreds of thousands of immigrants that the United States originally admitted temporarily as political refugees, before the cold war ended and wars subsided in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
It is the success of democracy here that makes these immigrants vulnerable to deportation.
Not only would their return strain job markets at home; it would deprive the migrants' home countries of the hard currency they send back to their families.
Mr. Clinton said he shared the concern about deportations. "There will be no mass deportations or targeting of citizens from any country," he said. "They will have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis."
But Doris Meissner, the Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner, acknowledged that without Congressional action to amend the law, "the level of removals from the United States will steadily increase."
She declined to specify what changes Mr. Clinton would seek, saying that could jeopardize discussions with Congress, which have begun.
Under the law, Mr. Clinton is able to exempt only 4,000 of the now illegal immigrants annually from deportation. It is that provision that he plans to suspend.
Ms. Meissner estimated that the total population of such Central American immigrants in the United States was "in the neighborhood of 300,000-plus" -- about 150,000 Salvadorans, 100,000 Guatemalans and 40,000 Nicaraguans. Those immigrants account for only a fraction of the five million illegal immigrants believed to be in the United States.
Under previous law, illegal immigrants were vulnerable to deportation. But immigration judges had wide latitude to grant exemptions, latitude that the new law restricts.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton also assured the Mexicans during his visit that he would seek to change a part of the law that would force illegal immigrants to return home while they waited for legal status, which could take years. That provision could affect many Mexicans, who are believed to account for 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the United States.
Mr. Clinton had previously suspended the provision on deportations, which was to take effect April 1, until August. He expressed confidence today that Congress would agree to amend it, suggesting that the United States bore some responsibility for the influx of immigrants because of its intervention in this region during the cold war.
After the meeting, some leaders said they were pleased with what they had heard. President Calderon Sol said, "There is time from now until September for a joint initiative with the Congress and to awaken more awareness within the Congress concerning this issue."
Leonel Fernandez Reyna, President of the Dominican Republic, said, "We understand that each case will be handled individually and in a humane manner, so we do think there will be a consideration." Mr. Fernandez attended elementary and junior high schoool in New York City, holds a green card and intends to live in the United States after serving as President, he said.
Mr. Clinton and the other leaders also agreed today on a parcel of modest law enforcement and trade programs, including an agreement to permit airlines to compete more freely for routes in the region.
