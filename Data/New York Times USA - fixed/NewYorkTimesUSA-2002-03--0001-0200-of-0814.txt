HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.

Opera

"ADRIANA LECOUVREUR." After "Tosca," it's the most famous opera about a diva. A century after the premiere of this enduring work by Francesco Cilea, Eve Queler and the Opera Orchestra of New York move from bel canto to verismo with the second in their season of three concert operas. Ms. Queler has a strong cast this time around: the role of Maurizio, first sung by Caruso, is taken by Marcello Giordani; the indomitable Dolora Zajick is the Princess, while Aprile Millo is the "humble handmaid" of art, Adriana herself, a role traditionally taken by the grandes dames of opera. Sunday night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $23 to $100 (Anne Midgette).

"DOCTOR FAUSTUS LIGHTS THE LIGHTS." Many of Gertrude Stein's writings are better known by their titles than by their contents, but her 1938 "Faustus" play has actually had a number of productions, both here and in Europe. Now Stanley Walden, a composer, has turned the piece into a new jazz opera, which will be given a workshop production this weekend by the Center for Contemporary Opera. Like Stein, Mr. Walden has a foot in both the United States and Europe; he has spent a number of years in Berlin, introducing American musical theater to German conservatory students, although in New York he may be better known for his work on "Oh! Calcutta!" Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Neighborhood Playhouse, 340 East 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 758-2757. Tickets: $25 (Midgette).

"L'ELISIR D'AMORE." Still basking in the afterglow of PBS's warm and fuzzy documentary about its octogenarian founders, the Amato Opera has mounted a new production of Donizetti's radiant comedy about requited love brought to fruition thanks to -- or in spite of -- a lovable traveling quack. The indefatigable Anthony Amato conducts, and Richard Cerullo, the company's resident designer, has produced period sets and costumes, including a paddle-wheel steamer to bring in Dulcamara (which, in Amato's tiny theater, should be quite a sight). Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; Sunday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $28; $23 for students, 65+ and children under 12 (Midgette).

"PORGY AND BESS." George Gershwin's great tribute to black American music returns to the New York City Opera this weekend, with previews tonight and tomorrow and a formal opening on Sunday afternoon. The performances begin the company's spring season. Tazewell Thompson directs. The sets by Douglas W. Schmidt are taken from a production originating at Radio City Music Hall in 1983. John DeMain conducts tonight, with Marquite Lister as Bess, Alvy Powell as Porgy, Angela Renee Simpson as Serena, Timothy Robert Blevins as Crown and Dwayne Clark as Sportin' Life. The matinee tomorrow is conducted by Richard Bado, with Alison Buchanan as Bess, James Edward Pierce as Porgy, Rochelle Ellis as Serena, Cedric Cannon as Crown and Robert Mack as Sportin' Life. Tomorrow night Mr. DeMain conducts again, with Marsha Thompson as Bess, Leonard Rowe as Porgy, Monique McDonald as Serena, Mr. Blevins as Crown and Mr. Clark as Sportin' Life. The opening on Sunday afternoon will have the same cast as tonight. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 1:30 p.m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $25 to $98 tonight; $30 to $105 tomorrow and Sunday; very few tickets remain on Sunday (Bernard Holland).

"RIGOLETTO." The soprano Ruth Ann Swenson's vocally lustrous portrayal of Gilda is the reason to see the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Verdi's "Rigoletto" in Otto Schenk's grimly effective 1989 production. In the title role, the baritone Juan Pons sings with intensity but with too much huffing and forcing of his voice. Though the tenor Marcelo Alvarez, as the Duke, has an essentially attractive voice and some zinging high notes, his singing is uneven and his legato sometimes rough. Denyce Graves provides some glamour in the small role of Maddalena. Marco Guidarini, in his company debut, gets a passably good but uninspired performance from the Met orchestra. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $30 to $190 (Anthony Tommasini).

"TOSCA." "Vissi d'arte," "I lived for art," sings Floria Tosca in this Puccini opera. Franco Zeffirelli's production at the Metropolitan Opera has been living for art since; its true-to-life replicas of the opera's venerable Roman settings evoke the originals more with every year. Now yet another cast has come in to occupy this familiar territory: Georgina Lukacs as the diva, Richard Leech as Cavaradossi, Carlo Guelfi as Scarpia, and the eminent Julius Rudel in the pit. Taken together, these four should make for a lot of loud if blunt music-making, which, depending on your tastes, could either bring across a resounding reading of the opera or provide a fitting rendering of what Joseph Kerman, the musicologist, famously dubbed a "shabby little shocker." Tomorrow night at 8:30, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: sold out, but returns may be available before the performance (Midgette).

"WAR AND PEACE," Prokofiev's epic four-hour operatic adaptation of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" has finally come to the Metropolitan Opera in a co-production with the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg. The project was spearheaded by the conductor Valery Gergiev, whose belief in this work comes through at every moment in this engrossing performance. The production by Andrei Konchalovsky offers some alluring silhouetted images and striking stage effects, like the burning-of-Moscow scene. But the set is dominated by a clunky rotating dome that slopes straight down into the orchestra pit, and it's unsettling to watch the singers negotiate the stage. The huge cast is splendid, especially Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Prince Andrei, Anna Netrebko as Natasha, Gegam Grigorian as Count Bezukhov and Samuel Ramey as Field Marshal Kutuzov. Saturday at 12:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: Sold out, but returns may be available before the performance (Tommasini).

Classical Music

ACADEMY OF ANCIENT MUSIC. Bearing one of the oldest names in the early-music field, and one of the most reliable, the Academy is conducted by its founder, Christopher Hogwood, in two Mozart piano concertos -- the C minor and the C major (K. 467) -- together with the D major Rondo (K. 382), all with Robert Levin playing the solos and extemporizing cadenzas. As if that were not enough, Mr. Levin also promises to improvise "in Mozart's style" on themes submitted by the audience. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $14 to $54 (Paul Griffiths).

BARGEMUSIC. This excellent series has had a rough season with, first, the terrorist attacks just across the way in Lower Manhattan and now a period of administrative upheaval, centering on a raise in musicians' pay. (And note the rise in ticket prices.) Still, with its view of the Manhattan skyline and its live, intimate acoustics, this remains one of the finest places in the city to hear chamber music. The concerts here were planned by the cellist Ronald Thomas, who is to be joined tonight by Randall Hodgkinson, a pianist, and Ida Levin, a violinist, in works by Beethoven, Dvorak and Roger Sessions. Tomorrow and on Sunday those performers are to be joined by Marcus Thompson, a violist, in works by Mozart, Faure and Ravel. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; $20 for students (James R. Oestreich).

BOSTON PHILHARMONIC. Benjamin Zander and this student orchestra have developed a cult following in Boston (with "60 Minutes" in tow) through performances of Beethoven and Mahler that some find revelatory. In a recent wave of recordings, most with the Philharmonia Orchestra of London, which is professional and then some, Mr. Zander's interpretations have tended to sound perverse in their zeal to make often dubious points. Tomorrow, at any rate, is an opportunity for cooler heads to judge the matter in Mahler's Ninth Symphony. The students, typically rehearsed to the teeth, will undoubtedly play beautifully. (Mr. Zander and the orchestra are to follow with a free concert and pep rally on Monday evening at Carnegie Hall, with audience participation.) Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $21 to $82 (Oestreich).

COLLEGIATE CHORALE. This venerable choir, directed by Robert Bass, is celebrating its 60th anniversary this season. With the Orchestra of St. Luke's on hand for support, Mr. Bass is leading his singers tonight in a hefty if oddly balanced program: Haydn's celebratory "Te Deum" and Mozart's sublime "Ave Verum Corpus" are to open the concert, and then the focus will shift to the world of opera. The soprano Kathleen Battle is to sing arias by Bellini and Rossini, and the choir will sing excerpts from Boito's "Mefistofele" and the "Va, pensiero" chorus from Verdi's "Nabucco." Ms. Battle then returns to sing a hefty selection of spirituals. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (917) 322-2140. Tickets: $15 to $75 (Allan Kozinn).

MANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC SYMPHONY. Gunther Schuller, who published a provocative book on conducting a few years ago, has the chance to demonstrate his ideas tonight when he conducts the Manhattan School students in Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony. The program also includes Lutoslawski's poetic Piano Concerto, with Jessica Bruser as the soloist, and Mr. Schuller's own classic "Seven Klee Studies." Tonight at 8, Borden Auditorium, Manhattan School of Music, 122nd Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 749-2802. Free. (Griffiths).

NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS. Clara Longstreth, the music director of the impressive New Amsterdam Singers, has won well-earned praise for her imaginative programming, which she continues with the chorus's all-20th-century offering this weekend, called "Spiritual Journey," which will be performed tonight and Sunday afternoon. There will be works by, among others, Poulenc, Messiaen, Rautavaara, Farkas and the New York premieres of Adolphus Hailstork's "God of Glory" and Judith Shatin's "Songs of War and Peace," the latter a commemoration of Israel's 50th anniversary. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 4 p.m., Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, Central Park West, at 65th Street, (212) 568-5948. Tickets: $18 (Tommasini).

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Prokofiev's Second Piano Concerto is a work of beastly difficulties, and the young Russian firebrand Arcadi Volodos seems just the man to grapple with it. Leonard Slatkin conducts an attractive program, also including Bartok's Romanian Folk Dances and Witold Lutoslawski's Third Symphony, a two-movement work from 1983 that draws inspiration from Classical symphonies, notably those of Haydn. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow and Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: today, $19 to $68; tomorrow and Monday, $21 to $82 (Oestreich).

PHILHARMONIA VIRTUOSI. The centerpiece of this program is likely to be a performance of the Schumann Cello Concerto, with Carter Brey, the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic. The program, to be conducted by Richard Kapp, the orchestra's founder and director, also includes Haydn's Symphony No. 100, Stravinsky's "Pulcinella" and Jose Bragato's "Graciela y Buenos Aires." Tomorrow night at 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $30 (Kozinn).

POLYHYMNIA. Even those who know choral music by the 15th-century Dutch master Jacob Obrecht are unlikely to know everything here -- selections from several Masses, the ceremonial motet "Quis Numerare Queat" and a "Salve Regina" -- and will need no further encouragement to seek it out. Those who don't know Obrecht's music are in for a rare and delightful immersion. The program, "Of Flanders Fair," is the work of a small and presumably elite group, performing in its eighth season. Tomorrow night at 8, St. John's in the Village, 11th Street and Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (917) 838-4636. Tickets: $15; $10 for students, 60+ and members of Early Music America (Oestreich).

"PUEBLO JOVEN." This oratorio by the tango master Astor Piazzolla and the poet Horacio Ferrer looks at the history of Argentina, with an eye to its economic and social landscapes. The work is to be performed by the Cosmopolitan Symphony Orchestra, with Katie Viquiera, a folk singer; Juan Villarreal narrating; and Pablo Zinger conducting. Filling out the program is a group of Piazzolla's instrumental works, including several New York premieres. They are to be performed by Triangulo, an ensemble in which Mr. Zinger is the pianist, with Marco Granados, flutist, and Gustavo Tavares, cellist. Sunday at 3 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $30 to $35 (Kozinn).

BRYN TERFEL. The renowned bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, who has come to town to rehearse the Metropolitan Opera's much anticipated production of Verdi's "Falstaff," which opens later this month, will give his only New York recital of the season on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall. There will be songs by Schubert, Duparc, Copland, Vaughan Williams and Roger Quilter and the premiere of a work by Jake Heggie, the composer of the opera "Dead Man Walking." Mr. Terfel's accompanist is the elegant pianist Malcolm Martineau. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $24 to $102 (Tommasini).

Dance

DONALD BYRD/THE GROUP. Mr. Byrd's gritty and energetic choreography is on display in a panorama of jazz dancing through the decades, a romp based on social dancing and a serious meditation on the state of art in America. Tonight at 7; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 12 and 5 p.m. New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $10 to $30 (Jack Anderson).

CHAMECKI AND LERNER. Performing in the 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Project's 92 and 42 Festival, the Brazilian modern-dance choreographers and dancers Rosane Chamecki and Andrea Lerner will present "Hidden Form," which chronicles a woman's attempts to confront her fears, and their 1997 "Antonio Caldo," a film and dance piece about the unpredictability of fate. Tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5552. Tickets: $20 (Jennifer Dunning).

COMPAGNIA ESPANOLA DE ANTONIO MARQUEZ. Mr. Marquez, who is from Seville, trained at and performed with the Ballet National de Espana and danced as a lead performer with Ballet Espanol de Madrid and Ballet Region de Murcia. He has received the Most Esteemed Professional Dancer award from the Spanish government. Tomorrow night at 8, the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6222. Tickets: $25 to $35 (Dunning).

CONSTRUCTION COMPANY: DANCE/MUSIC COLLABORATIONS. Three choreographers (Rajika Puri, Christopher Caines and Linda Seifert) will collaborate with three composers (Nora York, Anton Webern and Lois Dilivio). Tomorrow through Monday at 8 p.m., Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 924-7882. Tickets: $12; $10 for students and 65+. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office (Dunning).

DANCE AT THE 92ND STREET Y. The Y offers two informal programs this weekend. Skip Costa, Regina Nejman and Netta Terushalmy will perform today at noon in a free showcase of new dances and works-in-progress. Molly Rabinowitz will preview a dance with gymnastics equipment on Sunday at 3 p.m. The 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5552. Tickets: $10 (Dunning).

PAULA HUNTER. Sounds as if Ms. Hunter is doing her usual madcap thing in "The Unexpected," seven linked episodes that pop up in a woman's mind after a car runs into her house. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, Dixon Place, 309 East 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 532-1546. Tickets: $15 (Theater Development Fund vouchers accepted); $10 for students and 65+ (Dunning).

PAUL KAISER AND SHEELEY ESHKAR: "PEDESTRIAN." Miniature computer-generated pedestrians will interact with the real thing in three locations in New York City, through March 23. The outdoor sites are the Studio Museum in Harlem (144 West 125th Street) and 45 Rockefeller Plaza (51st Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas), where the free show goes on for 24 hours, seven days a week. The virtual street dodgers will also be seen at the Eyebeam Atelier in Chelsea (540 West 21st Street) in a free show that can be seen Wednesdays through Saturdays from noon to 6 p.m. (Dunning)

NANCY KARP AND DANCERS. Ms. Karp and her San Francisco-based modern-dance troupe, relatively unknown to New Yorkers, will perform excerpts from "Kalasam," inspired by a fascination with Indian dance and music that the choreographer shares with her composer and longtime collaborator Paul Dresher. Two other pieces will also be performed, set to music by Charles Amirkhanian and Bill Fontana. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+ (Dunning).

KENNEDY CENTER: JOFFREY BALLET OF CHICAGO. Washington is about as close as New Yorkers are likely to get to this former resident troupe, and the program is a nicely varied one. All three dances are classics: the company director Gerald Arpino's pretty, speedy "Kettantanz"; Agnes de Mille's "Rodeo"; and Antony Tudor's brooding "Lilac Garden." Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Kennedy Center, Washington, (202) 467-4600; outside Washington, (800) 444-1324. Tickets: $26 to $65 (Dunning).

MOISEYEV DANCE COMPANY. The mighty Moiseyev of Moscow will present its usual bill of gliding, galloping folk dances and exuberant folk music from Russia, with a newer repertory from nine other nations, including Spain, Japan, China, Mexico and the United States. Tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 2 p.m. Lehman Concert Hall, Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833. Tickets: $25 to $40 (Dunning).

NATIONAL DANCE THEATER COMPANY OF JAMAICA. Still going strong after 40 years, the troupe will perform classics and a New York premiere.

NEW YORK BAROQUE DANCE COMPANY. The audience, which is invited but not required to wear costumes, will join the dancers in an 18th-century ball. The evening will also include excerpts from Gluck's "Orfeo," Rameau's "Zephyre" and a version by Carlos Fittante of Corelli's "Follia." Tonight through Sunday night (and March 7 through 10) at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).

PEYARI DANCE PROJECT. Jen MacQueen has choreographed musical theater, industrial shows and children's touring shows in addition to concert dance. In "Be," which is set to music by composers and performers including Scott Joplin, Janis Joplin, Metallica and Corky and the Juice Pigs, Ms. MacQueen and her modern-dance company tackle the need to achieve spiritual and emotional fulfillment and to help others achieve it. Tomorrow and Thursday at 7 p.m.; Sunday at 1 p.m.; Monday at 8:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 6 p.m. Raw Space, 529 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).

HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE. The company's engagement as a whole is called "X," and because it features premieres as well as older works, that X can stand for the unknown. But it also stands for the troupe's celebration of its 10th anniversary, and guest dancers will add to the festivities. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-1515. Tickets: $20, except for tonight, a benefit for Dancers Responding to AIDS, when tickets are $40 (Anderson).

PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY. One of modern dance's great choreographic eclectics gazes on human foibles, sometimes lovingly, sometimes with amusement and sometimes with alarm. His repertory, taken from five decades of choreographic creativity, includes serious dances about the Great Depression and religious fervor, a spoof of psychoanalysis and tributes to the joy of movement and the tinkling sounds of old player pianos and music boxes. Tonight at 8; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $30 to $60 (Anderson).

TRINITY IRISH DANCE COMPANY. The troupe's home is Chicago, and its technique derives from that of traditional Irish step dancing. But its outlook is global, and its choreographers are not afraid to use old traditions in new ways. Its offerings range from a work inspired by a dream to pieces combining Irish dances with steps deriving from soft shoe and the swing era of the 1950's. Tonight at 8; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $38 (Anderson).

WORKS AND PROCESS AT THE GUGGENHEIM: ANDREW ASNES AND JOHN SELYA. Who else but these two goofy modern-dance and ballet choreographers would do a soft shoe in flippers? That is part of their new "Synch or Swim," which will be performed in a program that also includes a discussion of their collaborative process. Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m., the Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587. Tickets: $18; $12 for students and 65+ (Dunning).

HEADLINE: New Chief Says It's Go on Lincoln Center 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Reynold Levy, the new president of Lincoln Center, said yesterday that he planned to proceed on schedule with the organization's contentious $1.2 billion redevelopment plan and that he hoped the project would help make the center more inviting to audiences it doesn't usually attract.
 One of the goals of the plan is to redesign the central plaza and surrounding buildings to make them less imposing. In an interview, Mr. Levy said, "To the degree that the redevelopment plan will have people lingering a bit, I think that's a big plus for audience diversity." 
 Mr. Levy was unanimously selected yesterday by the center's board and will officially begin work on May 1, although he said he planned to begin meeting with Lincoln Center executives and board members immediately.
Given the fractiousness over the 10-year redevelopment plan and indications from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg that the city might not be able to keep to its commitment to provide $240 million over 10 years, it is clear that he has his work cut out for him. In the interview, also attended by the center's chairwoman, Beverly Sills, he presented himself as a patient conciliator who thought he could fashion consensus on issues like whether to build a new home for the New York City Opera, a subject that has already led to recriminations and staff turmoil.
Mr. Levy is president of the International Rescue Committee, one of the world's largest refugee relief organizations. Before that he was president of the AT&T Foundation, which specializes in giving to the arts, and he was also a senior officer in charge of government relations. He has also been executive director of the 92nd Street Y.
Some arts professionals have said the job of Lincoln Center president is a no-win position because of the complicated relationship between the center and the 12 often powerful independent arts groups that function on its campus. While Lincoln Center Inc. is the complex's landlord, it is also just one constituent among many that shape broad policy.
Nevertheless, Mr. Levy, a scholarly-looking, soft-spoken man of 57, said he didn't need more authority than the president's office already has. "It's very important that the constituent companies see Lincoln Center Inc. as serving them," he said.
"These companies have to live together in close proximity and work together in the interests of artists and audiences," he added. "I don't think it would serve anyone's interests to have a change of authority overriding the will of the others."
Rather, Mr. Levy said, he is excited about the job and undaunted by the prospect of trying to unite Lincoln Center's constituents. "Redeveloping this campus is a complicated, long-term task, so a lot of the reports of differences don't surprise me," he said. While he added that he thought those differences were natural, Mr. Levy also said that they had been exaggerated.
"On 90 percent of these issues there is total agreement," he said. "I wouldn't rule out the possibility of coming to an agreement."
In the past Ms. Sills has said she would step down when a new president was in place. Yesterday she declined to be specific about when that might happen. "I will stay for a smooth transition," she said. "I've not made it a secret that I'm leaving."
Mr. Levy said he was in no hurry to see Ms. Sills go. "I intend to learn as much and do as much with Beverly as I can while she's here," he said. "The judgment of how long she's here is entirely hers."
So far, the 11 groups participating in the redevelopment have been unable to agree on whether City Opera should stay at the New York State Theater, which it shares with the New York City Ballet, or move to its own new home, and whether Avery Fisher Hall, home of the New York Philharmonic, should be renovated or razed and replaced.
The City Opera is considering a move downtown to the site of the World Trade Center as part of a larger cultural complex. Ms. Sills, a former City Opera star, said she still hoped the City Opera would find a way to stay put. "I worry about the company," she said. "I think they will be able to raise the money to build a new house. What has to be asked is, can you get endowment money to maintain the house? There are a lot of practicalities that trouble me."
Mr. Levy said it was too soon for him to take a position on City Opera and other unresolved aspects of the redevelopment. His first task, he said, would be "an enormous amount of active, empathic listening."
"There are a lot of committed trustees and arts managers and administrators who put their lives into their companies and serving their audiences," Mr. Levy said. "I need to know what they're thinking and what motivates them. Also to develop warm and trusting relations."
Some arts professionals involved with the center have suggested changing the bylaws, which require board unanimity on every major aspect of the plan. Mr. Levy said he hoped that would be unnecessary. He also said he believed the redevelopment could move forward despite the large outstanding issues. "I think a great deal can be done without every i being dotted and every t being crossed," he said.
Although the events of Sept. 11 and a difficult economic climate will make raising money for the redevelopment a challenge, Mr. Levy said, he is optimistic about coming up with the money. He said he would begin fund-raising immediately after formally taking over in May.
"We have had the largest aggregation of wealth the country has ever seen," he said. "We have an enormous number of people who have taken care of themselves, of their families, who are looking to do something consequential and enduring. Lincoln Center offers the opportunity to participate in projects that will have meaning for decades."
While some arts professionals outside Lincoln Center question whether the institution can pull off its redevelopment, Mr. Levy suggested that everyone would get on board. "There does come a time when it is necessary to recognize that everyone is part of a continuous physical space," he said. "That is what should give rise to collaboration."

HEADLINE: U.S. More Wary on Bailouts Abroad

 BODY:
In the vast lecture hall where he taught introductory economics to hundreds of students at Stanford University, John B. Taylor would sing, dance and even dress up as a California raisin to show how government intervention can distort markets.
 Now, wearing a staid suit in a lavish Treasury office once occupied by Andrew Johnson, Mr. Taylor, the under secretary for international affairs, intends to bring the Bush administration's hands-off market-based philosophy to troubled countries around the world. 
 In the biggest crisis on his watch so far -- Argentina's default on much of its debt -- Mr. Taylor has essentially left American creditors to fend for themselves. "We don't want to be bailing out the private bondholders," he said in an interview. "Official resources are limited." 
Because research into the creditworthiness of emerging economies has improved, Mr. Taylor said, financial crises these days are less likely than before to spread beyond their country of origin. That means the rationale for the United States and other wealthy nations to step in and bail out countries like Argentina has dwindled. "You can't continue to have large, elephant-style packages," he said.
Instead of intervening after a crisis, Mr. Taylor argued, the United States and other governments should work to improve the flow of information between international borrowers and lenders. "What we have been trying to do is to find a way to add clarity to how these markets work," he said. Private-sector lenders would then feel more comfortable lending to them, and more money would flow at lower interest rates, he said.
The notion that financial contagion is a thing of the past gets mixed reviews from other experts in international economics. "It's probably premature to reach that judgment," said Edwin M. Truman, who served in senior international finance policy posts at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury during the Clinton administration and is now a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics. "It so happens in the Argentine case that it hasn't caused a lot of contagion," Mr. Truman said. "There will be other mistakes; there will be more contagion."
Mr. Taylor may have another reason for being reticent in Argentina's case. Strategic importance to the United States can make obtaining international aid easier, said Barry J. Eichengreen, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Turkey, which is a member of NATO, has received a steady stream of financial support. "If the country is Argentina, which is less critical from a political point of view, that becomes less of a motivation."
Mr. Taylor said his very first meeting as under secretary dealt with Turkey. He met with Horst Kohler and Anne O. Krueger, the director and first deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, and they decided that Turkey would not have to face many conditions or checkpoints while receiving aid from the fund. Instead, Turkey would mainly be held to targets for fiscal health before a new aid package began. The fund would become less of a back-seat driver for troubled countries pursuing economic reforms.
Not for the first time, academic pedigree may forge a close relationship between the Treasury and the I.M.F. In the 1990's, Professor Eichengreen said, it was common knowledge in economic circles that Lawrence H. Summers, who held Mr. Taylor's job and eventually became Treasury secretary in the Clinton cabinet, had taken courses from Stanley Fischer, who held Ms. Krueger's current job from 1994 to 2001. Now, Mr. Taylor works alongside his Stanford University colleague of eight years, Ms. Krueger.
In testimony before Congress two weeks ago, Mr. Taylor backed some of Ms. Krueger's ideas for limiting the chaos inherent in debt crises like Argentina's. He praised clauses written into bond contracts that, in the event of a default, would oblige creditors to accept majority voting on repayment deals rather than require unanimous consent. But he stopped short of endorsing "a larger role for the I.M.F. than the more decentralized market-oriented approach," in which the fund might serve as an arbiter or debtor-in-possession during a country's bankruptcy.
Mr. Taylor has also made revamping of the World Bank and its partner institutions a top priority. "The World Bank and the multilateral development banks have had too many roles," he said.
In his view, Mr. Taylor said, the only way to end poverty is to concentrate exclusively on programs that enhance the productivity of labor. He said he was pleased that President Bush had called for the World Bank to change its aid from loans to grants and to provide aid based on the potential for measurable improvements in productivity -- essentially, through a market.
The World Bank declined to comment on the administration's proposals.

HEADLINE: EchoStar Announces Smaller 4th-Quarter Loss 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: LITTLETON, Colo. Feb. 28 

 BODY:
A satellite television company, EchoStar Communications, posted a narrower fourth-quarter loss today, with net subscriber additions on the high side of analysts' expectations.
 The company, which operates the Dish Network and plans to take over its larger rival, Hughes Electronics, posted a loss of $42.9 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $184.2 million, or 39 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. EchoStar is based in Littleton. 
 Revenue rose 43 percent, to $1.15 billion from $805.4 million a year ago. The results exceeded analysts' estimates, which ranged from $1.06 billion to $1.10 billion.
Shares in EchoStar rallied sharply in response, rising $2.52, or 11 percent, to $26.12 a share on Nasdaq. 
Revenue for the full year was $4 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in 2000. EchoStar repeated that it expected revenue this year to rise by 20 percent to 25 percent, even though the economy is still slow.
EchoStar added 400,000 net subscribers during the quarter, a gain that was within analysts' forecasts of 350,000 to 410,000 additions. It ended 2001 with 6.83 million subscribers.
Net subscriber additions rose 11 percent from 360,000 in the third quarter, but fell 19 percent from 495,000 a year earlier.
Average monthly revenue per subscriber, a key measurement for satellite and cable companies, was $49.32 for 2001, up 8.8 percent from $45.33 in 2000. The company said it expected a modest increase in monthly revenue per subscriber.
Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $395 per subscriber, up 17 percent from $338 in 2000. EchoStar said it expected subscriber acquisition costs in 2002 to be consistent with those in 2001.
EchoStar's chief executive, Charles W. Ergen, said the regulatory review of the Hughes merger was proceeding as expected.
The $25 billion deal would combine the top two satellite broadcasters. The prospect of that step has raised concerns that it would eliminate competition in the satellite market and slow the two companies' efforts to offer local channels and other services in smaller and rural markets.

HEADLINE: A Swiss Vote on Joining U.N. Has a Good Chance This Time 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: SION, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Encompassing the majestic Matterhorn, the Great St. Bernard Pass and the upscale Zermatt ski resort, this ancient valley, known by the Romans as Vallis Poenina and now as Valais, is expected to vote on March 3 in favor of joining the United Nations -- but just barely.
 The decisive vote on whether to open Switzerland to the outside world will be close here in the heartland, which backed the overwhelming vote against a similar bid 16 years ago. 
 But an unusual government, banking, labor and industry coalition is trying to push this aloof Alpine enclave, which has long prided itself on independence, neutrality and armed preparedness, to ease away from its splendid isolation. Nationalists are pushing back, urging the country not to abandon neutrality.
In 1986, even as the Soviet Union was crumbling, the Communist threat still gripped Switzerland, which required every home to have a nuclear bomb shelter. Valaisans surpassed their countrymen in rebuffing United Nations membership, piling up an 83 percent "no." 
Now the Valais economy has shifted from its self-sufficiently agrarian base and, like Switzerland's as a whole, thrives on the three pillars of banking, insurance and services, bringing people into closer contact with the outside world, said Francois Dayer, chief editor of the daily Le Nouvelliste. "It's been a complete transformation," he said in his Sion office. "In 50 years, we've gone from washing our laundry at the fountain to the washing machine."
Yet, he concedes, the argument for neutrality still has a powerful attraction for the country's older, rural, often German-speaking population. 
The isolationist Swiss People's Party maintains that United Nations membership would cancel "direct democracy, neutrality and federalism," and that Switzerland would be dragged into military engagements and economic boycotts at the bidding of powerful nations. The arguments are rewarmed from 1986, but instead of Russia and China, the party leader, Christoph Blocher, points to the United States. 
"It's the large countries that have the say, and now it's the Americans," he said, invoking fears here that Switzerland will be forced to take part in an American-led response to terrorism. Opinion polls last fall found that more than 70 percent of Swiss saw the Sept. 11 attacks resulting from flawed American policies, especially in the Middle East.
"The anti-United States sentiment is very strong now," noted Chantal Balet Emery, of western Switzerland's Economie Suisse business federation, who agreed with some experts that such sentiments could tip the balance against joining. "People are afraid of U.S. overreaction," she said. "At the same time, they are afraid of terrorism, and realize we can't defend ourselves alone."
The federal government has countered that Sweden, Austria and Finland, United Nations members, have not abandoned their neutrality or independence. They argue that Swiss troops are already in the Balkans, even if only for logistical backup, and that Switzerland has observed most recent economic sanctions.
Promoting United Nations membership may also take some heat off Switzerland for banking practices that have enriched it. Europeans and Americans are pressing the Swiss to shed their banking secrecy and improve rules against money laundering, customs fraud and tax evasion. 
"Symbolically," Rudolf Stahm, a Swiss lawmaker, told the magazine L'Hebdo, "a 'yes' would soften our reputation as a 'bad guy.' "

HEADLINE: Budget for Port Agency Projects Stays High, With More Security 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved a $4.5 billion expense and capital budget for 2002 today that was about $100 million less than last year's spending plan, and reflected the loss of the agency's World Trade Center complex in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.
 But that loss was largely offset by $1.1 billion that the agency has already received from their insurance policy on the towers. The agency is also negotiating for a remaining $270 million that it claims it is due because of a variety of emergency expenses and losses from the attacks. 
 The budget also reflected some $120 million in additional security costs at the airports, bridges, tunnels and terminals that the agency operates, a 50 percent increase over the previous year's figure.
There was only minor trimming of the agency's ambitious, $14 billion, five-year capital construction program. And the port agency also decided to increase its reserves as a sign to the financial community that the authority is still strong financially and well able to cover the costs associated with its accumulated $7.2 billion in outstanding bonds.
"The world changed on Sept. 11," said Jack G. Sinagra, the chairman of the 12-member board. "This budget reflects new realities and new priorities. The region will be stronger, more secure and more prosperous as a result of the spending program approved today."
Agency officials said that in spite of the difficulties they faced in the last year, they would be spending $544 million over the next 18 months to restore PATH service to Lower Manhattan. In addition, work will continue to complete the Air Train system to connect Kennedy International Airport to subway and Long Island Rail Road lines. The agency will also continue a host of other airport improvements and begin planning for a permanent ferry terminal at Battery Park City and one at La Guardia Airport.
Gross operating revenues were $2.7 billion, up 2 percent over the previous year's gross but below pre-Sept. 11 projections of $2.9 billion. The 7,000-employee agency's net income from operations, or the accounting equivalent of profit, was $109 million last year, a steep decline from the $372 million net from 2000.
Expenses were $2.1 billion compared with $1.8 billion the year before and well over the budgeted 2001 amount of $1.9 billion.
Charles F. McClafferty, the chief financial officer of the Port Authority, said that activity levels at the facilities it operated reflected economic declines generally in the region as well as specific effects of Sept. 11. The 82 million air travelers last year at the three airports were down 11 percent from the 2000 levels, and the 2002 budget envisions that figure's declining to 72 million, Mr. McClafferty said.

HEADLINE: Europe Opens Convention To Set Future of Its Union 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
A European Union that has become increasingly distant from its citizens began an extraordinary effort today to create a more representative government as the 15-nation bloc expands across the Continent and absorbs as many as nine new members.
 A group of 105 parliamentarians, experts and governmental nominees opened a yearlong constitutional convention of sorts in Brussels that was designed to chart a more efficient and more democratic structure for the growing union. 
 "If we succeed, in 50 years' time, Europe will have changed its role in the world," said the convention's chairman, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president. "It will be respected and listened to, not only as the economic power it already is, but as a political power that will speak as an equal with the largest existing and future powers on the planet." 
Symbolic of European aspirations for a more perfect association, the convention began on the day that national currencies like the French franc and the German mark officially stopped circulating, replaced by a single European currency, the euro, in 12 of the member states.
Already creaking at its current size, the European Union is expected to expand to as many as 24 nations by the middle of 2004, as it takes in the poorer countries of formerly socialist eastern Europe, with the Balkan states and Turkey still to come.
But how such a vastly bigger European Union should be shaped and governed -- as a federation or as a confederation of different states, and in a way that small countries have a say and large countries have a stake and ordinary citizens feel some real connection to the bureaucrats in Brussels -- has bedeviled busy leaders for years.
So last December, at their summit meeting in Laeken, Belgium, European nations agreed to set up this convention, which has been likened to the American constitutional convention of 1787.
"If we fail," Mr. Giscard d'Estaing warned the delegates today, "each country will go back to the logic of a free trade area. None of us, not even the biggest, would have sufficient weight to deal with the big powers of this world."
In his opening address today, he switched from French to English to German, and, rather like the Pope at Christmas, greeted the assembled "ladies and gentlemen" in all 11 official languages of the European Union, and then in Polish as a gesture to the candidate states.
How to better share sovereignty between Brussels and the member states, whether to directly elect a "president" of Europe, whether to give more executive powers to the government-appointed European Commission in Brussels and more legislative powers to the European Parliament are knotty questions that go to the heart of Europe's future.
But the delegates will also grapple with how to make decision-making more efficient in a Europe where some nations want to move faster than others and France, for example, does not want to lose the old principle, enshrined in the early days of the union, of equality with a Germany that is now reunited and much larger.
Nor do smaller states, like Denmark, Finland or Ireland, want to be bulldozed by the larger states, so the smaller ones are likely to favor continued strong powers for the commission.
The convention could even try to draft a European constitution, which would try to put the last 50 years of stop-gap treaties into one, coherent document.
It will be the leaders of the member nations who will receive the recommendations of this convention and decide what to do. But it will be harder for the leaders to ignore the recommendations that emerge from this open process, and harder for them to maintain the European Union as a top-down affair, with little power given to the European Parliament.
For all the talk of Philadelphia in 1787, the dream of a "United States of Europe," which animated one of the European Union's founders, Jean Monnet, the French economist, has been dead for years.
The president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, said that the real aim of this convention "is not to build a superstate." European integration is unique, he said, and "the E.U. is unique in that it is a union of peoples and states."
But he supported the idea of a constitution for Europe, saying that such a document would mark "the birth of Europe as a political entity."

HEADLINE: Mr. Mugabe's Destructive Course 

 BODY:
An honest election in Zimbabwe next week could well end President Robert Mugabe's 22-year grip on power there. To prevent that, Mr. Mugabe has been doing all he can to deny a fair chance to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Voters have been arbitrarily disqualified, European and African election observers harassed and the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, implausibly charged with treason. Should the opposition win anyway, army officers have pledged to keep Mr. Mugabe in power. Repressive new laws permit the banning of public rallies and silencing of critical reporting. A fraudulent election could seriously harm not only Zimbabwe, but also many of its neighbors. These countries, especially South Africa, need to take a stronger stand against Mr. Mugabe's attempts to suffocate democracy. 
 Zimbabwe was once one of southern Africa's most democratic and prosperous countries. Today it is a wreck that threatens the region's stability and prospects. The economy has been contracting sharply for three years. Average incomes have fallen dramatically and famine threatens. 
 The European Union imposed sanctions on Mr. Mugabe and his close cronies after the head of its team of election observers was expelled. Washington has rightly banned American visas for Mr. Mugabe's inner circle. But the impact of these measures has been blunted by the failure of South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, and the 14-country Southern African Development Community to take strong action too. Mr. Mugabe is still shielded by misplaced deference from Mr. Mbeki and other African leaders who view him as a former icon of the African liberation struggle. 
The liberation Africa needs today is from deepening poverty, corrupt governments, shameful neglect by Western aid givers and the skittishness of foreign investors. Last month, Mr. Mbeki was in New York soliciting support for a farsighted international partnership designed to attack these problems head on, linking an African commitment to better governance with a call for greater international investment. By failing to take strong action against Mr. Mugabe's manipulations, Mr. Mbeki betrays the spirit of this promising initiative.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
S.& P. and Nasdaq Dropped for Month, but Dow Gained

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its biggest monthly drop since September, on concern corporate profits would rebound more slowly than expected.
 Intel and Walt Disney led the loss. 
 "It's hard to see where earnings increases are going to come from to sustain any kind of rally," said Wendell Perkins of Johnson Asset Management in Racine, Wis. 
The S.& P. 500 fell 3.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,106.73. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 21.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,106.13. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 20.39 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,731.49.
For the month, the S.& P. 500 dropped 2.1 percent, and the Nasdaq shed 10 percent. Both also fell in January. The Dow rose 1.9 percent, its fourth monthly gain in five months.
Stocks initially gained after a government report showed that the economy grew at the fastest pace in a year in the fourth quarter and an industry report showed that manufacturing in the Chicago area expanded in February for the first time since July 2000. For a second day, the rally faded on concern about how much profits would rebound and when.
Cigna, Kinder Morgan and PeopleSoft tumbled amid concern their accounting practices did not accurately reflect earnings.
"People are gravitating to companies in businesses they can get their arms around," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Trust and Savings in Chicago.
Disney slid $1.25, to $23. A Goldman, Sachs analyst, Richard Greenfield, said Disney might miss estimates for its second quarter.
Intel fell $1.34, to $28.55. Its shares trade at 54 times earnings, and some analysts said that makes them too expensive.
Kinder Morgan slumped $5.20, to $41, after a Prudential Securities analyst, Carol Coale, questioned the use of partnerships at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners "to enhance bottom-line earnings of the parent company," which is Kinder Morgan. She lowered her rating of the company. Kinder Morgan Energy fell $3.30, to $28.60.
Cigna declined $4.18, to $89.70. The company, a health insurer, said the Justice Department was investigating whether a New Mexico unit had accurately reported costs to collect Medicare reimbursements.
PeopleSoft dropped $2.77, to $29.07. The information service SEC Insight said the Securities and Exchange Commission might be investigating the company, which makes business software, or a competitor.
A company spokesman said it had not been told of an inquiry, and an S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after three reports showed better economic growth, fewer jobless claims than expected and a surge in regional manufacturing activity.
The losses wiped out some of the hefty gains of Wednesday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said an expected recovery would probably be moderate, suggesting interest rates would remain steady for months to come.
The reports yesterday prompted market players to raise the odds that the Fed might increase its benchmark overnight bank lending rate, currently at a 40-year low of 1.75 percent, as soon as the June policy meeting.
By late in the day, the price of a 10-year note fell 13/32, to 100 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.87 percent from 4.83 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond dropped 25/32, to a price of 99 13/32. Its yield rose to 5.42 percent from 5.36 percent.

HEADLINE: Cubans Set On Asylum Crash a Bus Into Embassy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
A bus carrying Cubans seeking to leave the island nation crashed through the gates of the Mexican Embassy in Havana late Wednesday. At least 21 Cubans remained inside the embassy today, Mexican officials said, adding that they did not qualify for political asylum. 
 After the blue and white bus rammed through the embassy's gate in the upscale Miramar neighborhood, the police battled with youths who tried to push their way into the compound behind the bus. An unknown number were arrested. 
 Hundreds of police officers with nightsticks and dogs were deployed to control the crowds around the embassy Wednesday night. Today the streets leading to the mission were blocked with government vehicles and patrolled by police officers and plainclothes agents.
The bus episode came after a day when small groups of people gathered outside the embassy on hearing rumors that the Mexican government was offering asylum. The rumors, Cuban and Mexican officials said, were based on a report from Radio Marti, a station financed by the United States government. It quoted Foreign Minister Jorge G. Castaneda of Mexico as saying, "The doors of the Mexican Embassy in Havana are open to all Cuban citizens, as is Mexico."
Mr. Castaneda made the comments on Tuesday night in Miami, where he was presiding over the opening of the Mexican Cultural Institute. He said today that Radio Marti had taken his words out of context and that he had been speaking in general terms about how the institute would welcome all visitors.
Mr. Castaneda said that 'radical elements in Miami" were angered that President Vicente Fox of Mexico had visited Cuba this month to reaffirm ties with President Fidel Castro. Those Cubans, he said, had sought to "use and twist these declarations about the Mexican Cultural Institute and, in effect, Mexico's traditional policy, to launch what we could call a small provocation."
The Cuban government blamed Radio Marti for the episode, accusing it of "cynically" twisting Mr. Castaneda's words. Mr. Castro drove past the embassy compound in a military vehicle about two hours after the bus incident, but he made no comment at that time. 
Salvador Lew, the director of the Office of Cuban Broadcasting, which oversees Radio and TV Marti, denied that there was any distortion. 
"We have on tape what he said and that was what we transmitted, not one word more or less," Mr. Lew said. "We made no comment. We transmitted his voice. If he now has repented, it is his right. But if he has bad memory I can give him a copy so he can hear it."
Mexican officials, hoping to avert a diplomatic crisis or a wave of refugees, said today that they were trying to persuade the asylum seekers to leave the embassy compound.
"They are, it appears to be the case, without employment and want to go to Mexico for economic reasons, so it will be very difficult that they will be given a visa," Mr. Castaneda said on the radio in Mexico City this morning. "We are not going to press charges, but we want to speak with them to see if they can leave the embassy in a quick and friendly manner, because in reality they have nothing to do there." 
A similar standoff at the Peruvian Embassy in 1980 set off the Marielboatlift, when 125,000 Cubans left the island.
President Fox now faces a delicate situation. As part of his goal of nudging Cuba toward reform, he also met with Cuban dissidents who have been advocating for human rights and democracy.
Mr. Castaneda sent his deputy foreign minister to Havana this morning to negotiate with the group and to obtain assurances from Mr. Castro that no reprisals would be taken. 
While Cuban officials continue to blame Radio Marti for the incident a State Department official said it was beside the point.
"The reason that 20 people are in the Mexican Embassy in Havana is not because of what the foreign minister said or what was reported," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It is because those people, like 11 million others, live in a country in which there are essentially no human rights. In countries where human rights are respected, you do not have incidents where buses crash into embassy gates as a way of people trying to get out of the country."

HEADLINE: 2 Clothing Retailers Post Gains 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Limited Inc., the second-largest United States clothing retailer, and its majority-owned Intimate Brands Inc. said their fiscal fourth-quarter profits rose as the companies controlled inventories and expenses.
 A 35 percent profit gain at Intimate Brands, the parent of the Victoria's Secret lingerie stores, bolstered Limited's net income by 37 percent to $326.5 million, or 75 cents a share, in the quarter, which ended Feb. 2. 
Limited's sales fell 11 percent to $3.14 billion. The company plans to buy the 16 percent stake it does not already own in Intimate Brands. 
 The companies kept their inventories down heading into the holiday season and controlled costs, which bolstered profit margins. They also benefited as shoppers paid full price for Limited's denim jeans and stretch fabric clothing, and Victoria's Secret bras and panties, analysts said. First-quarter sales will be hurt as consumers remain wary of spending in the recession, the retailers said.
The shares of Limited, which owns Express and Limited stores, fell 28 cents, to $18.01. Intimate Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works stores, fell 37 cents, to $19.33. 
The companies, which are based in Columbus, said per-share earnings in the first quarter will be little changed from a year earlier, as sales at stores open at least a year decline at Limited and remain unchanged at Intimate Brands. Profit this year will rise at a "low- to mid-single-digit" percentage rate, the companies said. 
Limited has 1,997 stores and Intimate Brands has 2,617 stores. Gap Inc. is the largest United States clothing retailer. Net income rose to $299.9 million, or 61 cents, at Intimate Brands. Its sales were little changed at $1.94 billion.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report Shows Rapid Aging Of Populations Around Globe 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
While many countries worry about a bulge in the number of restless young people with no jobs and too much time on their hands, the United Nations said today that the world's population is in fact steadily getting older everywhere.
 "The changes that are going on are not paralleled in any century before the 20th century," said Joseph Chamie, an American demographer who directs the United Nations population division. "We will see this trend accelerating in the 21st century." 
 Mr. Chamie introduced figures show aging as pervasive -- not just confined to rich countries -- and likely to have profound implications on economies in all regions.
If there were fears of instability generated by the idea of large numbers of unemployed young people becoming ready recruits for militancy or criminal activities, an older population raises other concerns.
As the United States has already discovered, pressures mount on health care systems, health insurance plans and social security as well as private pensions. In poorer countries, some of these safety nets do not now exist. Sri Lanka, for example, has a rapidly aging population and free health care -- but no social security and few pension plans outside government service.
The United Nations found that in richer countries, people over 60 now account for one-fifth of the population. Predictions indicate that the proportion will reach one-third by 2050. In poorer countries, only 8 percent of the population is over 60 now, but that is expected to rise to 20 percent by 2050.
With more people living longer and families getting smaller in most countries, the fastest-growing age group in the world are people over 80, the United Nations found. That group is growing at 3.8 percent annually.
United Nations demographers are riveted on a statistic they call the "potential support ratio": the number of people 15 to 64 who are available as workers to sustain the retirees. In 1950, the ratio was 12 to 1; in 2000, it was 9 to 1. By 2050, there may be only four working-age people for every person over 65 worldwide.
On Tuesday, Secretary General Kofi Annan released a report on the abuse of the elderly, in advance of a conference in Madrid in April on issues facing the aging. It mentioned practices like ostracism, which occurs in some societies when elderly women are used as scapegoats for natural disasters, epidemics or other catastrophes. "Women have been ostracized, tortured, maimed or even killed if they failed to flee the community," the report read. 
It also asserted that while physical, financial, emotional and sexual abuse of older people is "grossly underreported" generally, studies done in the United States, Argentina, Australia, Britain and Canada show that the problem is found in richer as well as poorer nations.

HEADLINE: Amex Coming Back to Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
American Express is abandoning Jersey City and moving its employees back to its building in Lower Manhattan to consolidate operations that were scattered across the New York region after the World Trade Center attack.
 The decision, described by American Express executives in a memorandum to employees yesterday, reverses an early decision to significantly reduce the number of workers in Lower Manhattan by shifting some of them to Jersey City. 
 But American Express officials said that after making a round of layoffs late last year, there would be enough space in Lower Manhattan to accommodate all of its local employees. American Express owns the building it will be reoccupying, 3 World Financial Center, in a partnership with Lehman Brothers, which has not committed to returning. 
"American Express today is so far the biggest win for the city and the state," said M. Myers Mermel, the president of Tenantwise.com, a commercial real estate broker on Wall Street.
The decision to return 3,500 employees to the World Financial Center is considered a much-needed boost for New York as it struggles to recover from the Sept. 11 attack. Those workers returning to the city include about 560 technology and finance workers who had been in Jersey City since 1999.
"They made the pledge to come back to Lower Manhattan, but they went beyond that by taking 500 additional jobs from Jersey City and into Lower Manhattan," said Charles E. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. "I am hoping that this could be a reversal of the trend of these jobs moving out of the city."
The move was a blow to economic development officials in Jersey City who had still hoped to retain some companies that had relocated after the attacks. "We are sorry to see them go, but we are glad to see New York is rebounding," said Stan H. Eason, a spokesman for Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham. 
The Sept. 11 attack displaced 4,500 American Express workers based in 3 World Financial Center, 40 Wall Street and 7 World Trade Center. The workers were sent to the Jersey City office and other space that the company quickly leased in Stamford, Conn., and Short Hills and Parsippany, N.J.
Molly Faust, an American Express spokeswoman, said the decision to close the Jersey City office and move everything back to Lower Manhattan was made primarily for financial reasons.
Ms. Faust said the total number of employees back in Manhattan -- about 4,000 -- will be lower than the company's pre-Sept. 11 head count because of a round of layoffs at the company.
"Work force reductions mean that we have more space in the World Financial Center and now we have the space to bring the people back to the city," she said, adding that American Express plans to sublease its office space in Jersey City and three other locations. 
Jersey City became the home to several companies displaced in the attack, including Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
Mr. Gargano said American Express received no tax breaks or other financial incentives to return to New York.
In November, American Express executives said they planned to return some workers to the World Financial Center but would keep a significant contingent in Jersey City. But officials involved in the process said that with the layoffs, officials realized they could save more money by consolidating operations.
In the months after the attacks, many companies said they were going to spread their operations over the region for security reasons. But many analysts said the costs of making such moves in tough economic times might be too high.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth Rate, at 1.4%, Is Far Better Than Expected 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With consumer spending holding up much better than anyone had expected, the American economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported yesterday in a sharp upward revision of its original estimate. The new growth rate was surprisingly vigorous for a nation in recession.
 A few forecasters even went so far as to declare an end to the recession that started last March. Most were more cautious, however, noting that apart from consumption, other basic indicators of the economy's health were still going in the wrong direction -- particularly unemployment, profits and business spending. 
 "What drove up consumer spending in the fourth quarter, and is still driving it up, was zero-percent financing, price discounts, tax rebates and huge promotional pricing for big- ticket items," said James W. Paulsen, a senior economist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "If nothing else, there soon won't be anyone left who needs anything."
Although the recession officially started last March, when the economy began to weaken, there has been only one quarter of negative growth. That was the third quarter, which included the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the instant, but short-lived damage to airline travel, tourism and retail sales.
Reflecting the rapid bounce-back, the Commerce Department said in January that the gross domestic product, after declining at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the third quarter, had risen in the fourth at a meager 0.2 percent, adjusted for inflation. The revision increased that first estimate sevenfold.
Trying to explain the strength in consumer spending through so many months of recession, economists and pollsters increasingly argue that bargain prices have been too tempting for consumers to resist -- despite rising debt loads and widespread layoffs. Some economists particularly cite the sharp drop in borrowing costs as the Federal Reserve cut rates in rapid response to the weakening economy.
Whatever the reasons, spending on durable goods -- that is, big-ticket items like vehicles, appliances, furniture and the like -- rose to a very strong annual rate of $1.021 trillion, up $81.1 billion from the third quarter, more than enough to account for the positive economic growth.
The current recession, the 10th since World War II, is an anomaly. Virtually all of the others have resulted from a decline in consumer spending, followed by a drop in business investment in machinery, computers, office buildings, factories and all the other tools used to produce goods and services.
This time, however, business investment brought on the recession as it fell sharply from its surging levels in the late 1990's, while personal consumption remained strong, even rising at a very robust 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, up from the 5.4 percent originally estimated.
And business investment must revive to end the recession decisively. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, made that point in Congressional testimony on Wednesday. The hope, of course, is that consumer spending will sustain the economy, even at a low rate of growth, until business investment kicks back in.
Some economists, including Mr. Paulsen, contend that consumption will falter because the bargain pricing that has sustained consumer spending will give out soon. Most forecasters, however, anticipate that consumption can remain robust until capital spending begins to revive, perhaps in late summer.
The optimists note that while spending on buildings fell sharply in the fourth quarter, the decline in spending on machinery and equipment slowed, suggesting that the excess production capacity that has inhibited investment is abating.
"What you are betting is that the kick from consumption and inventories that we are getting will incite the passion of investors; I don't mean stock market investors, I mean the business executives who invest in real capital," said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist who expects a revival in business investment by July.
Consumption and inventories of unsold merchandise are intertwined. The strong consumer spending, particularly for new vehicles during weeks of zero-interest financing, reduced inventories at an annual rate of $120 billion in the fourth quarter, or nearly double the rate in the third quarter. With inventories falling to levels characteristic of the late 1990's boom, inventory restocking resumed late last year.
The Commerce Department, in its first estimate of fourth-quarter growth, had given imports too big a role in this restocking. The revision yesterday showed that imports, which add nothing to America's economic growth, were less than expected and that domestic production, particularly of durable goods, played a bigger role. Half of the upward revision in the fourth-quarter G.D.P. number came from this change.

FOUNDER IS STEPPING DOWN AS CHIEF AT LILLIAN VERNON

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Lillian Vernon Corporation, which sells household items and toys, said yesterday that its chief executive, Lillian Vernon, was stepping down. Ms. Vernon, who founded the company in 1951, asked its board to begin a search for a new chief executive, said the chief financial officer, Wayne Palladino. Ms. Vernon will remain chairman and focus on licensing the company's name and expanding its business, the retailer said. Lillian Vernon publishes eight catalogs under titles like Lilly's Kids and Sales and Bargains, and sells goods over the Internet. Sales have fallen amid the recession, and the company, based in Rye, N.Y., said it would eliminate regular quarterly dividends after it paid a dividend of 4 cents a share today.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: France: Jobless Rate Rises 

BYLINE:  By John Tagliabue (NYT) 

 BODY:
 As French business reacted with layoffs to an economy that contracted in the fourth quarter of last year, the number of French unemployed rose by 5,000 in January, to 2.41 million people, or 9 percent of the work force, its highest level in more than a year. The French economy contracted 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, its first decline in five years, slowed by the economic sluggishness of France's two biggest trade partners, Germany and the United States. 
Jobs are a major issue in the French presidential race, which ends with a first round of voting in April. The government expects the economy to grow only 1.5 percent this year, after a 2 percent rise in 2001. John Tagliabue (NYT)

 Companies in the New York City metropolitan region are reluctant to hire workers, according to a new study. 
Three quarters of the purchasing managers surveyed said the hiring outlook was bad and almost 10 percent called it ugly. But the executives also said that business conditions stabilized in February after bottoming out in the wake of Sept. 11. Still, signs of an economic recovery are scarce, said Marc N.

WALINSKY, LOUIS J.

 BODY:
 WALINSKY-Louis J. Economist and playwright, died peacefully in Washington, DC, on December 24, 2001, at the age of 93. Walinsky was born in London, the son of the labor leader Ossip J. Walinsky and the sculptress and author Rosa Newman Walinsky. Coming to America in 1915, he attended Cornell University where he received honors in economics. After graduate study at the University of Berlin, he wrote the play "Heil Hitler!" His dramatization of Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" was banned in London, but performed in Paris by the English Players. He taught economics in New York City high schools from 1930 until 1943, when he joined the War Production Board in Washington, remaining there with the Civilian Production Administration until 1947. He then led the efforts of the World ORT Union to rehabilitate and train Displaced Persons in the refugee camps of Europe. In 1950 he joined Robert R. Nathan Associates in Washington, DC, working mostly on the problems of developing nations. He served from 1953 to 1958 as Chief Economic Adviser to the Government of Burma (now Myanmar). After 1963 he worked as a consultant for the World Bank, undertaking missions to Korea, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Brazil, East Africa, Israel, Iran, India, Bolivia, Venezuela, Newfoundland, Papua New Guinea and Puerto Rico. He authored several books on economic development. He was an original member of the national board of Americans for Democratic Action, and the Executive Director of the International Commission of the World Jewish Congress in 1979-80. 
From 1991 to 1995 he was vice chairman of the American Friends of Democracy in Burma, which opposed the military dictatorship there. His wife Dorothy died in 1987. An earlier marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his daughters, Marian Harrison of Bethesda, MD, and Louisa Parker of Vancouver, BC, by his son, Adam of Scarsdale, NY, and sister, Emily Rubin of New York City, and by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. A memorial service will take place at Joseph Gawler and Sons, 5130 Wisconsin Avenue NW, in Washington, D.C. on April 26 at 11 AM.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Pact Would Set Global Accounting Rules 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
As Congress and regulatory officials consider ways to tighten auditing and accounting rules to prevent a repeat of the Enron debacle, a little-known global agreement that places untested new requirements on the domestic regulation of professional services like accounting is quietly advancing -- with the help of firms like Arthur Andersen, Enron's much-criticized auditor. 
 The new rules would give the World Trade Organization oversight of the domestic regulation of accounting. Any new national regulation could be challenged by other countries as unfair if it was "more trade restrictive than necessary." 
 Critics of the new rules say such a standard could hobble a government's ability to regulate scores of services. But American officials say the requirement will simply prevent governments from setting up discriminatory rules, limitations and quotas that would interfere with the right of foreign service companies to enter their markets. 
So far, the new rules, which are being drafted by the World Trade Organization with the help of Arthur Andersen and other companies, have attracted little outside attention. They fall under the General Agreement on Trade in Services, or GATS, a 1994 pact that seeks to liberalize trade in many areas, like architecture and real estate brokerage services, the way the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, has done for many goods.
The services agreement has generated none of the public controversy that has swirled around the organization's attempts to promote merchandise trade. Even after street protests disrupted the group's Seattle conference in 1999, talks on services moved forward.
But since the Enron bankruptcy proceedings drew public attention to accounting practices, public interest groups and critics of free trade have begun to worry that the services pact may hamper efforts to curb abuses. 
"The Enron-Andersen crisis just shows that governments need to retain the ability to experiment with deregulation and then, if they realize they've gone too far, to re-regulate," said Ellen D. Gould, an independent consultant and researcher working on contract with Georgetown University. "What the W.T.O. and these agreements seek to do is make deregulation a one-way street." 
Even critics agree that in the current atmosphere, unfair-trade complaints would be unlikely against the measures now being discussed. But they ask how the new rules will be interpreted when future issues arise, and a government proposes measures disliked by a trading partner. 
"What we really need to ask is to what degree are global agreements like this going to limit our ability to regulate services domestically," said Patricia J. Arnold, an associate professor of business at the University of Wisconsin's Milwaukee campus. "The long-term goal of GATS is to eliminate barriers in the cross-border trade in services." 
American trade officials said such fears were overblown. They point to recent changes in banking regulations, also covered by the services agreement, that were not challenged by any nation on trade grounds. 
"We think that these things are written sufficiently broadly enough not to cause any problems," a senior trade official said. 
Joshua Ronen, a professor of accounting at New York University, said the detailed agreement on accounting now being drawn up did not specify licensing requirements or exam standards for individual nations; it merely insists that any such regulations be legitimate and transparent. "I don't think they will have any impact on any reform the United States has in mind," he said.
GATS was adopted in 1994 by the 140 nations of the trade organization in response to brisk growth in services, which accounted for one-fifth of all cross-border trade in 1999, or more than $1.35 trillion in all. Trade in services has grown faster than merchandise trade for 20 years. 
The agreement covers nearly all services, except those provided solely by governments and those involved in air transportation. Developing nations are given leeway to offer some protection for local companies.
Accounting was one of the first services for which detailed rules were written. Charles Leonard, an Arthur Andersen spokesman, said the firm was part of an international accounting group that helped draft them. "We were striving for openness and transparency in national standards," he said. 
The rules do not take formal effect until 2005, but member nations have already agreed not to impose any new regulations that do not meet the proposed standard for openness. 
It is not clear how that commitment applies to the measures now being debated in Washington. During the process of drafting the agreement several years ago, American officials raised questions about whether prohibiting an accounting company from doing both auditing and consulting work for the same client would be viewed as restricting trade. Such a measure is being considered in Washington now.

HEADLINE: An Early Fighting Stance In McCall and Cuomo Race 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Sounding the central theme of his campaign for governor, H. Carl McCall called yesterday for an $8-billion-a-year increase in school spending, while his Democratic opponent for the nomination, Andrew M. Cuomo, traveled upstate to promise aid for small businesses.
 But a day that the two candidates had hoped to devote to some of the first substantive proposals of their campaigns quickly devolved into the sort of caustic exchanges normally not heard until close to the September primary. 
 Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, visited the O. Henry Learning Center in Chelsea to make what his campaign billed as a major proposal on education. He said that as governor, he would increase state aid to schools -- now more than $14 billion a year -- to more than $22 billion within four years, a striking goal for a state that is already among the biggest spenders on education. 
He also promised a system of tracking school performance modeled on Compstat, the New York City Police Department's program for mapping patterns in crime and holding local commanders accountable for responding to changes. As mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed much the same thing last year.
"You've got to set priorities," Mr. McCall said. "For me, education is going to be my No. 1 priority."
But aides to Mr. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, and Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republican incumbent, were quick to attack the plan.
"While we support Mr. McCall's goals, it's completely irresponsible for the comptroller, who claims to be the state's fiscal watchdog, to put forward an $8 billion plan without saying how he's going to pay for it," said Josh Isay, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager.
Mr. McCall noted that in the last four years, the state increased school aid by almost $4 billion annually and cut taxes by about $8 billion a year, which he called proof that state revenues would rise fast enough to pay for his plan. But that assumes that the economy will reprise its record-setting performance of the late 1990's and, his foes said, it shows that a McCall administration would not cut taxes.
Mr. Pataki's office and campaign deputized Randy Daniels, the only high-ranking black official in the Pataki administration, to respond to Mr. McCall, who is black. Mr. Daniels, the secretary of state, criticized Mr. McCall's performance a decade ago as president of the New York City Board of Education -- a line of attack that Cuomo and Pataki advisers have said they will use frequently.
"When he was president of the Board of Education, reading and math scores declined, numbers of Regents diplomas declined, and the student-teacher ratio increased," Mr. Daniels said.
Mr. McCall said his system for tracking school performance would compile criteria for each school, like test scores, class sizes and building conditions. Much of that information is already available, but he said it was important to put it together.
Meanwhile, Mr. Cuomo, in Syracuse, proposed investing $100 million in state money with small venture capital firms that would, in turn, invest it in small businesses. He said the proposal, patterned on a federal program, would create 10,000 jobs.
Mr. Cuomo has toured upstate New York extensively, lamenting the sluggishness of the region's economy and blaming Mr. Pataki, and arguing that small-business growth is the answer. "Small businesses are the engine of growth of the New York economy, creating 8 out of 10 new jobs each year, and we need to invest in them to help them grow," Mr. Cuomo said.
Hank Sheinkopf, Mr. McCall's chief campaign strategist, charged that Mr. Cuomo never delivered most of the thousands of jobs he promised his programs would produce at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "Andy will say anything and do anything to get elected," Mr. Sheinkopf said.
The Pataki camp expressed a favorite theme of its own: reminders that Mr. Cuomo's father is former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. "Let's not forget that under Andy's father, New York lost 450,000 jobs," Mr. Daniels said.

HEADLINE: Target's Net Income Rises 19% 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Target Corporation reported a 19 percent increase in its fiscal fourth-quarter income yesterday as its Target discount stores recorded higher revenue from bargain-hunting shoppers and it took market share from a financially troubled competitor, Kmart.
 Target -- which includes Marshall Field's stores and Mervyn's -- said net income rose to $658 million, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter ended Feb. 2, compared with $552 million, or 61 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
The results met Wall Street expectations, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
 Revenue increased 7.4 percent, to $13.24 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of retail performance, rose 4.6 percent. Same-store sales in the Target chain were up 6.2 percent.
On a conference call with investors, Target, based in Minneapolis, said analysts' estimates for the current quarter of 31 cents a share and for the full year of $1.75 were achievable, but it warned that it could fall short if the economy weakened.
A figure of "$1.75 is a reasonable single-point estimate," Target's chief financial officer, Douglas Scovanner, said. "I think the chances of exceeding that are 50 percent, and therefore chances of falling short of that are somewhat less than that." 
The company's tepid outlook did not seem to impress investors, and the stock fell $2, to $41.90, on volume of nearly 16 million shares.
"A lot of retailers have been coming out and saying there is upside to the numbers," said Eric Beder, retail analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann. "Target hinted at it, but didn't flat out say they would beat the estimates." Target and its bigger rival, Wal-Mart, have gained market share from Kmart, which filed for bankruptcy late in January.

HEADLINE: Clients Reel At Indictments In Tax Scheme 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Albert Schussler, the wealthy executive at the center of a widening bribery scandal over tax assessments in New York City, apparently did not discriminate among luxury hotels, battered garment center buildings, McDonald's franchises and skyscrapers, as long as he got his fee, according to investigators.
 Mr. Schussler, who was a tax consultant to dozens of property owners, paid city tax assessors millions to slash his clients' annual property tax bills, prosecutors said. 
 None of the owners, who considered Mr. Schussler a friend and a shrewd tax expert, have been implicated in the scheme, and many of them are still reeling from the news of Mr. Schussler's indictment this week on federal racketeering charges, along with 17 current and former tax assessors. 
Still, his work on their behalf stretches from Lower Manhattan through the Upper East Side to Harlem and resulted in illegal tax cuts worth at least $160 million over the last four years, according to James B. Comey, the United States attorney in Manhattan.
A look at the 545 properties in Manhattan that were involved in Mr. Schussler's scheme indicates that some of the city's wealthiest and most powerful owners and developers -- Leonard Litwin, Stephen L. Green, the late Stanley Stahl, Burton P. Resnick, Sheldon H. Solow -- were multiple winners in what prosecutors have described as a tax sweepstakes.
The Bamford, the Stratford, the Pavilion and the Lucerne are all luxury high-rise apartment buildings on the East Side of Manhattan that are owned by Mr. Litwin's Glenwood Management company, and each got illegal tax breaks, according to investigators.
So did two towers owned by Mr. Solow, including 9 West 57th Street, the 50-story skyscraper that offers spectacular views of Central Park and some of the highest office rents in the city.
The office buildings owned by Mr. Green, chairman of the publicly traded SL Green Realty, are more modest, but he has at least 16 properties on the list.
There are nine properties owned by Mr. Resnick's family, including a downtown development site and an apartment house at 422 East 72nd Street.
Cohen Brothers Realty has five buildings on the list, including 622 Third Avenue and 750 Lexington Avenue, the 33-story tower clad in blue glass and granite at 59th Street.
Perhaps the largest beneficiary of the operation was one of Mr. Schussler's real estate partners, Mr. Stahl, who died in 1999 at age 75. He owned at least 16 properties in Manhattan that are on the list.
Mr. Schussler, Mr. Stahl and Jesse Krasnow, another real estate investor, were partners in the landmark Ansonia Hotel. Mr. Schussler and Mr. Krasnow also run a company, Lefferts-Fore, that manages buildings they own, some of which also received illegal tax breaks, according to investigators.
Few of Mr. Schussler's clients and friends were willing to discuss him. But the quiet 85-year-old executive, who once was a public tax assessor himself, traveled in the highest circles of the real estate industry in a city where skyscrapers are king.
"He's been suspended from all activities," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's influential lobbying organization.
Mr. Schussler's ties to his real estate brethren were social and political. He is a fund-raiser and the interim president of the American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, while Judith Resnick, the wife of Mr. Resnick, chairman of the Real Estate Board, is a director.
Mr. Green, who was a prime fund-raiser for his brother Mark's unsuccessful mayoral campaign last year, solicited $10,000 from Mr. Schussler, his wife, Claire, and another family member, according to a report issued by the Green campaign.
"They've all told me they had not the slightest inkling of any wrongdoing on the part of Schussler," said Howard J. Rubenstein, a publicist who represents Mr. Green, Mr. Resnick and Mr. Solow. "They were all stunned when the accusations were made."
Some owners said that Mr. Schussler charged a flat retainer for his services, ranging from $200,000 to $400,000 for a portfolio of buildings. Taxes represent the largest single cost of operating a property in New York, so owners are keenly interested in tamping down the city's annual assessment.
"I recommended Schussler because he was a good guy and he delivered, just like my lawyer," said one major property owner. "I didn't know about any bribery."
According to the indictment, Mr. Schussler offered bribes of thousands of dollars to city tax assessors for 35 years in exchange for reducing assessments on particular buildings. This year alone, the city expects to raise about $8.5 billion in property tax revenues.
Mr. Spinola of the Real Estate Board acknowledged that the taxes were cut on some buildings, but he said many others on the prosecutor's list seemed to be at the proper rate.
"I think he ran a scam," Mr. Spinola said. "He used his knowledge to scare his clients into believing that taxes were going up and he had to go in and fight real hard to deal with it."

HEADLINE: Bank of Japan, in Shift, Agrees to Loosen Credit 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Under intense political pressure, the Bank of Japan moved to further loosen its monetary policy today, agreeing to buy more government bonds and ease restrictions on borrowing.
 The measures, announced after a meeting of the bank's policy board, came after heavy lobbying by the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, who wanted the bank to contribute more to the government's efforts to fight deflation and stimulate the economy, even though its short-term interest rates are already effectively zero. 
 The bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, had said repeatedly that the bank had done all it could and that it was up to the government to get its finances in order and solve the bad-debt problems of the banks.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi announced the government's latest plan for the economy on Wednesday, which included tougher bank inspections, incentives for writing off nonperforming loans and easier credit for small companies. 
Mr. Koizumi has also been struggling to reduce spending and narrow the country's budget deficit and has promised to limit the government's new borrowing. To ease the situation, the government has called on the central bank to step up its purchases of government bonds. 
The bank said today that it would begin buying 1 trillion yen ($7.5 billion) in long-term government bonds every month, an increase of 25 percent. It also removed ceilings on the length of time that companies will have to borrow directly from the central bank to cover cash flow problems as the fiscal year draws to an end on March 31.
Though it gave in to the government's wishes, the bank's policy board tried to head off any erosion of its credibility by stressing in its announcement that for its actions to do any good, they must be accompanied by additional steps to clean up the banking sector.
"To realize the full permeation of the effects of strong monetary easing, it is essential to strengthen a financial system and ensure its stability by making a swift move to resolve the nonperforming-loan problem," the board said. "The bank strongly hopes that both the government and the private sector, in particular financial institutions, will take more determined and effective steps in this regard."
But neither the central bank nor the government appeared ready to take the kinds of aggressive steps urged by investors, by the Bush administration and by others to deal with the banking problems and revive the economy. 
Mr. Koizumi and his top financial regulator, Hakuo Yanagisawa, have said that they think the country's banks have enough capital to meet their obligations and that a full-scale bailout is not required, while Mr. Hayami has dashed hopes that the central bank would set a goal of having prices rise slowly, rather than remain stable or fall. 
"The Bank of Japan and government continue to take small, gradual steps and won't act aggressively until push comes to shove," said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo. "The steps so far are just a Band-Aid on the real wounds."
Bond investors and analysts, at least, are running out of patience. The interest-rate premium demanded by investors who buy Japanese bank bonds has doubled in recent weeks, and credit-rating agencies are warning of another round of downgrades for government debt. Standard & Poor's said today that the government still lacked "a clear plan to lift the economy out of its entrenched slump."
The slump is deep. New statistics today, showing industrial output falling in January, added to the weakness in retail sales, capital spending and other important indicators. But economists said today's actions by the central bank would have little effect on growth.
Alluding to the impotence of the German government in the face of economic crisis and hyperinflation in the 1920's, Marshall Gittler, a strategist at the Bank of America in Tokyo, said, "This is the Weimar solution to Japan's problems, and will do nothing to help the economy."

HEADLINE: Migrants From Afar See Mexico as Steppingstone to U.S. 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: PUERTO MADERO, Mexico 

 BODY:
For the price of a first-class plane ticket, 31-year-old Pablo Juela got a bum ride.
 With his country, Ecuador, racked by double-digit unemployment and inflation, Mr. Juela said that with a fifth-grade education he was unable to find a good job and could not make a decent life for his five children on his earnings as a street vendor of less than $50 a week. 
 He hired a smuggler for what he believed would be a safe, although illegal, journey to the United States. He said he borrowed $1,000 from relatives and a former employer to make a down payment to a man who never identified himself. He promised to pay the remainder -- $5,000 -- once he got to his brother's house in the Bronx. 
Mr. Juela hardly got what he paid for. This month, United States Coast Guard and Mexican Navy boats seized two rickety fishing vessels overloaded with hundreds of Ecuadorean men and women off the southern tip of Mexico. Mr. Juela was the among the desperate passengers, many of them suffering dehydration and gangrene. 
A third boat, loaded with 151 people, including immigrants from the Middle East, was intercepted by United States Coast Guard officials some 200 miles away from Ecuador and forced to return to port.
Mexico has long been a major source of illegal immigrants to the United States. But geography has also made this country an important international hub for criminal networks that smuggle immigrants from around the world, an industry that rivals the drug trade in profits and ruthlessness. Many of their multilayered operations in this country begin here at Mexico's southern border with Guatemala.
In the southern state of Chiapas alone, some 80,000 undocumented immigrants were detained by Mexican officials last year. The overwhelming majority came from Central America. But those detained included dozens of people from India, Lebanon, Iraq, and Sierra Leone and some 992 Ecuadoreans.
The illegal flow of immigrants to the United States dropped by half after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In his first 18 months in office, Mexican's president, Vicente Fox, tried to improve security along Mexico's southern border with Guatemala by increasing the number of migration agents posted at border checkpoints, and by cracking down on corrupt immigration officials and immigrant smugglers.
United States Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said that many governments in Central America, another important way station in the international smuggling routes, had also increased law enforcement operations along land borders.
The human cargo recently seized at sea indicates to some American and Mexican officials that the flow of illegal immigrants may be beginning a new surge and that the heightened land security may be no more effective as hazard cones on a highway. Rather than stopping the flow of immigrants, the measures may be forcing smugglers onto uncharted, unmarked routes.
Mexican officials said that the vessels docked at this port of seamen and shark fishermen carried the largest loads of illegal immigrants captured here since the early 1990's when leaking trawlers loaded with hundreds of Chinese immigrants were intercepted along the coast of Baja California. Last year, the Mexican Navy captured nine immigrant vessels, most of them small motorboats or rafts with only one or two immigrants aboard.
"The numbers of people on these recent boats indicates a change," said Rear Adm. Carlos Martinez de Anda. "It looks like the smugglers are moving out to sea."
The activity is mirrored at the United States-Mexico border, where operations by the United States Border Patrol at major crossing areas have forced immigrants to attempt their illegal journeys across isolated deserts. More than 100 of them died last year from exposure.
"It may be too early to call this a trend, but the signs are troubling," said Deputy Interior Minister Javier Moctezuma. "It is something that concerns us."
The trip at sea terrified the hundreds of immigrants captured separately aboard two Ecuadorean fishing vessels this month. 
"Shrimp is a major product of my country and I never get to eat it," said Wilson Montenegro, 21, explaining why he embarked on the perilous journey. "I want a job that pays me a man's salary. I want my sons to have pencils and notebooks for school. I want them to eat shrimp." 
One vessel carried 211 immigrants and crew members. The other carried 167. Officials estimated that the vessels -- both named for sailing's comic hero, Popeye -- were more than 30 years old with maximum capacities of 12 to 20 people. The engines were held together with hanger wire and tin. They were discovered in rough seas more than 200 miles off the coast.
The immigrants, interviewed in an old basketball gymnasium that had been converted into a mass shelter, said they had been lost at sea for 10 days. Their food lasted for seven.
"The women were crying and fainting," said Segundo Pucuna Yerrobi, 36, a construction worker and father of five. "We were all scared, really scared. But the men tried to stay strong so that the women would not lose hope."
"As for me," he added. "I was losing hope."
Mexican investigators said the crews of the two boats had been detained and charged with immigrant smuggling. Initial interrogations indicate that the 12 suspects are fishermen, just about as down on their luck as the immigrants they ferried north, with only tenuous connections to the main smuggling operation. 
With little more than a handshake and a few sketchy details, the crew members were hired because of their navigating experience and for the use of their vessels. Each was offered $800 to $1,000 for the round-trip journey, which should have lasted 10 to 12 days. The fee is more than most of the crew earn in a month, they told Mexican officials.
Many of the immigrants, meanwhile, had paid fees that were higher than what they would earn in a year. In interviews, immigrants said they had agreed to pay smugglers $4,000 to $8,000 for "safe and comfortable" passage into the United States. Some had already paid at least half the fee. Most were going to live with family and friends in New York, which has a growing Ecuadorean community of an estimated 600,000 people.
Photos taken at the time the vessels were intercepted show men and women shoulder to shoulder with their knees bent. Empty cracker wrappers and tuna cans litter the decks. 
Mr. Juela said he was torn by relief and remorse when rescued by Mexican officials. "I wanted them to help us," he said. "But I also wanted them to let us go on our way." 
He was deported home on Valentine's Day. Again, his feelings seemed mixed.
"I am happy to be alive," he said before he departed. "I am happy that I have a family waiting for me.
"But what do I have to offer them?" he added. "All I had was this dream."

Enron Paid Huge Bonuses As Its Profits Were Inflated
Enron paid its executives huge one-time bonuses last year as a reward for hitting stock-price targets ending in 2000 -- the very time, investigators now say, when corporate officials were improperly inflating the company's profits by as much as a billion dollars.
 Legal experts said the payments could provide strong evidence of a motive for the financial machinations that investigators believe distorted Enron's reported performance and ultimately led to its demise. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Bush Officials Meet to Seek A Compromise On Steel Tariffs 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush's top political and economic advisers, deeply divided on one of the most excruciating decisions of Mr. Bush's 14-month-old presidency, met today to begin drafting a compromise that would place high tariffs on some imported steel, but force the American steel industry to shoulder the costs of the retirement benefits of its workers.
 The meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House came as thousands of steel workers massed on the Ellipse, only a few hundred yards away, greeting a parade of Democratic and Republican senators who called for tariffs of no less than 40 percent on steel from Russia, Germany, China and other major steel-producing countries. Mr. Bush is set to announce his decision on Wednesday, in response to the International Trade Commission's ruling in December that American steel producers had been injured by foreign competitors. 
 More is at stake than just a decision over tariffs, or even the fate of the steel industry. It is a critical political issue in West Virginia -- which Mr. Bush narrowly won in 2000, partly because he pledged to do more than President Bill Clinton to act on the industry's behalf -- as well as other swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
"The way the House goes this year may hinge on how we make this decision, and how we present it," one of Mr. Bush's aides said today.
Yet the decision is also a test of Mr. Bush's commitment to free markets, and his ability to convince the rest of the world, including allies in the war against terrorism, that he is keeping America's markets open. And there is little doubt that no matter what he decides next week, Europe will take him to the World Trade Organization, seeking to nullify the American action.
Though Mr. Bush initiated the trade case against imported steel last year, his top aides are now signaling that the president will probably shy away from granting the ailing steel industry many of the items on its lengthy wish list.
Today's meeting with Mr. Bush, which was led by Lawrence B. Lindsey, who heads the National Economic Council, and was attended by most of Mr. Bush's top economic and political aides, reviewed a wide range of options. "It was a listening session for the president," said one participant, "and it's fair to say he got a wide diversity of opinions." 
In fact, the administration has been fractured into two camps, with a few officials straddling compromise positions that Mr. Bush will have to explore in the next five days.
Mr. Lindsey, who did not offer his opinions at the meeting because he acted as moderator, has been described by his colleagues as taking a heavily free-market position -- consistent with his long-held views that any government intervention in the markets should be limited.
He has been joined in that view by R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who has warned that if the steel companies are given the 40 percent tariffs they demand the effects will ripple through the economy as a wide range of industries and consumers pay higher prices for cars, appliances and other goods just as the nation is struggling to emerge from recession.
"Glenn realizes that a tariff is another word for a tax, and the effects would be the same as raising taxes," one participant in the discussion said.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has also weighed in on the debate. He told Congress this week that keeping international markets open to the free flow of goods and services was "far more important" economically than the possible loss of jobs in the steel industry.
On the other side is the president's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, who advocates stiff tariffs to protect steelmaking jobs. Though participants said he did not speak at today's meeting, he has said that Mr. Bush can peel steel workers away from the Democratic Party. It is his mission to win back the Senate, which the Democrats hold by one vote, and to keep the House of Representatives from going to the Democrats in the November midterm elections.
West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania are critical in that effort, and Mr. Rove wants to make sure that President Bush can claim to have done far more to preserve steel industry jobs than President Clinton did in the 1990's.
Joining Mr. Rove is Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, who, in the words of one administration insider, "sounds much like the steel industry executives these days."
The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, has been putting together plans that would try to bridge the differences, keeping free-marketers at bay while satisfying the steel companies and workers.
But it is Mr. Zoellick who will have to defend the president's final decision before the World Trade Organization, where any tariffs would very likely be immediately challenged as a violation of America's obligation under international trade rules. A major problem for the administration is that most steel imports have been falling in recent years after surges during the Asian crisis in the late 1990's, making it tougher to justify punitive tariffs.
Administration officials have been canvassing both supporters and opponents of steel tariffs to determine what level -- the range most often discussed is 20 percent to 40 percent -- would do the most good for steel producers while doing the least damage to companies that depend on inexpensive steel, like the auto, heavy equipment and home appliance industries.
One official suggested today that it was unlikely that the president would impose 40 percent tariffs across the board, but might opt for a mix of high and moderate tariffs that average 20 percent to 30 percent.
"Does it have to be 40 percent?" the official asked. "I can't say that that's necessarily the case." 
But the official said the administration aimed to set the tariff level high enough to offer relief for the industry. Bethlehem Steel and LTV are among more than two dozen old-line steel makers that have filed for bankruptcy protection since 1998. And even modern minimills that are considered far more competitive in today's market say they are suffering from cheap imports and record low prices.
The administration appears to have firmly ruled out meeting the industry's demand for a bailout of the pension and health care costs for retired steel workers. Some traditional steel makers have requested a bailout of up to $12 billion to cover such costs, a step they say will help them clean up their balance sheet and arrange cost-saving mergers.
But smaller and newer steel makers that do not have large numbers of retired workers have argued strongly against such action, an administration official said. He added that the steel workers already get retirement and health benefits from other government-financed programs, as do most workers.
Gary Hill, chief executive of National Metalwares, a maker of tubular steel products for school furniture and lawn and garden equipment, has calculated that high tariffs could raise his costs 25 percent. That would hand a big advantage to overseas producers of value-added steel products, he said, and threaten his company's health. "The burden of this is going to fall on small companies, and I'm not sure that reality has come through," he said.

HEADLINE: TOP G.O.P. DONORS IN ENERGY INDUSTRY MET CHENEY PANEL 

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Eighteen of the energy industry's top 25 financial contributors to the Republican Party advised Vice President Dick Cheney's national energy task force last year, according to interviews and election records. 
 Critics of the Bush administration's energy policy have long suspected that many of the corporations that were invited to advise the White House were large energy concerns that had contributed heavily to President Bush's campaign and the Republican Party in 2000. The White House has refused to release the names of the companies and individuals consulted during the formulation of the administration's energy policy last spring. It has been sued for the information. 
 But interviews and task force correspondence demonstrate an apparent correlation between large campaign contributions and access to Mr. Cheney's task force. Of the top 25 energy industry donors to the Republican Party before the November 2000 election, 18 corporations sent executives or representatives to meet with Mr. Cheney, the task force chairman, or members of the task force and its staff. The companies include the Enron Corporation, the Southern Company, the Exelon Corporation, BP, the TXU Corporation, FirstEnergy and Anadarko Petroleum. 
Critics of the process said that President Bush and Mr. Cheney were quick to respond to executives from the energy sector not only because of campaign contributions but also because they share the philosophy of the oil patch, where both made fortunes.
"It's this bunch of guys in energy who say, 'Boo! We don't like this,' and the Bush administration says, 'Well, they elected us,' " said Eric Schaeffer, who was chief of regulatory enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency until his resignation on Wednesday. "This is a natural alliance. The administration didn't need a lot of persuading."
Mr. Schaeffer, who worked at the E.P.A. for 12 years, resigned over what he called lax enforcement of clean air laws. Page A19. 
The energy task force produced a report on May 17, 2001, that sketched out a national energy policy that was largely favorable to the energy industry. The report recommended additional oil and gas drilling and made note of the nation's need to build 1,300 to 1,900 electric plants to meet the projected demand over the next two decades. Next week, the Senate begins deliberations on the Bush administration's energy bill, which has already been passed by the House.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, sued Mr. Cheney last week to force him to turn over lists of the executives who had advised the task force. A federal judge has ordered the Energy Department to release 7,500 pages of documents related to the task force under a Freedom of Information Act request by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The government sought to dismiss another suit today from Judicial Watch, a legal watchdog group here, which had requested thousands of pages of documents relating to the task force from federal agencies. A federal judge allowed the suit to go forward, and the group said it has received some of the documents.
Two Congressional Democrats are trying to learn the level of influence that industry executives may have had on the White House's national energy policy.
Mary Matalin, counselor to Mr. Cheney, said the task force also consulted with trade groups and other organizations, including labor unions, that did not give money to the Republican Party.
"Not everyone who got access were contributors or supporters," Ms. Matalin said. "No one ever got on the schedule for any other reason than their expertise in the field of energy."
But energy industry officials expressed some wonderment at Mr. Cheney's adamant refusal to release the list of executives he met with. They said meetings between industry officials and the White House have long been routine, even in Democratic administrations, and that the list of corporations that advised the task force was hardly an industry secret. Several said a list of the top financial supporters of the Bush-Cheney ticket would reveal some, if not all, of the most influential voices on energy policy.
An oil industry executive suggested that as long as the White House withheld the list of those who talked to the task force, suspicion about secret agendas would tar the energy industry itself. "I understand philosophically why the vice president may be doing this," the executive said, "but this sure puts us in a pickle."
Mr. Cheney has argued that releasing the identities of outside advisers on energy policy would make it impossible to have confidential conversations and receive unvarnished advice from those outside the government.
More than 400 corporations and groups sought meetings with the energy task force last spring. About half that number were granted access, a group that included 158 energy companies and corporate trade associations, 22 labor unions, 13 environmental groups and a consumer organization, task force staff members have said.
Some environmental groups have complained that the process was tilted toward industry. The leaders of many groups have said Mr. Cheney's office turned down their requests to meet with him. Instead, midlevel staff members from the groups met with energy task force staff members. 
The Sierra Club met with the task force before the report was released on May 17. Two weeks later, Carl Pope, the group's executive director, met again at the White House for 30 minutes with Mr. Cheney.
"After we met with the vice president that time, they just waltzed us out on the White House lawn and put us in front of the TV cameras," Mr. Pope said. There were no cameras waiting when corporate chief executives and senior vice presidents met with the task force, he said.
In interviews this week, most of the Republicans' top 25 corporate contributors from the energy sector confirmed their contacts with the administration, and in many cases, executives even provided details of the issues they discussed with task force members or the vice president. Many pointed out that companies' opinions on most regulatory and environmental issues can be found on their Web sites. Three of the companies would not comment and four said they did not meet with Mr. Cheney or his staff.
The Exelon Corporation, one of the nation's largest electric utility companies, said its co-chief executive officers, Corbin A. McNeill Jr. and John W. Rowe, were among a group of about 75 energy executives who met with Mr. Cheney in the Old Executive Office Building in March. Along with other Nuclear Energy Institute participants, Mr. McNeill also met later in the month with Karl Rove, President Bush's chief strategist, and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's lead economic adviser, a company spokesman said.
The chairman of Ashland Petroleum, a major oil refining company, met with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham last spring to argue the arcana of increasing pipeline capacity. The chairman of BP, Lord John Browne, and other executives from the company, the 10th largest contributor to the Republican Party, met with Mr. Cheney and other administration officials in late February of 2001 to discuss international issues.
As part of a series of meetings organized by oil industry trade groups, the chairman of Anadarko Petroleum, Robert Allison, along with a handful of other executives, saw Mr. Cheney on Feb. 8, 2001. The 14th biggest donor to the Republican Party, Anadarko called for opening federal lands to greater oil and gas exploration and production, a cause it has championed for years.
"It's our job to meet with people, and it's the job of the administration to gather ideas," said Teresa Wong, a spokeswoman for Anadarko. "Bob Allison has been meeting with presidential administrations, with the Clinton administration and others, for years."
The Marathon Oil Corporation, among other oil companies, chose to have a trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, speak for it. "Our interests were represented by A.P.I. before the task force," a Marathon spokesman, Paul Weeditz, said.
No energy company contributed more to the Republican Party than Enron: $1.7 million in individuals' contributions, soft money donations and contributions from its political action committee. Enron appeared to have the most access to the task force. David S. Addington, counsel to Mr. Cheney, said in January that Enron executives had six meetings with the task force in 2001. Five were with staff members, on Feb. 22, March 7, April 9, Aug. 7 and Oct. 10. In the sixth meeting, on April 17, Kenneth L. Lay, the former Enron chairman, met with Mr. Cheney to discuss energy policy and the California energy crisis.
Discussions with the White House are nothing new to many executives in the energy industry, and companies' opinions on most regulatory and environmental issues are widely known. All of which has left the energy industry perplexed by the tug-of-war between Mr. Cheney and the Congressional accounting office.
"When I talk to people in the industry or in Congress, the sense is, What are we going to find out, that the energy industry was in there talking to the task force?' " said an executive from one large contributor to the Republican Party. "I don't think there's a list out there that could be far afield from any list of major companies. Within the industry, there's this feeling like, 'Don't we already know who was there?' "
A handful of the most sizable energy industry donors to the Republican Party said their officers did not meet with the vice president or with task force staff members. Some executives pointed out that with an administration led by a former oilman that shares the priorities of the rest of the energy industry, there is little need for dogged lobbying.
Lehman Brothers ranked as the sixth largest energy industry contributor to the Republican Party during the 1999-2000 election cycle. Lehman owned Peabody Energy, the world's largest coal mining company, and its subsidiary, Black Beauty Coal, until its initial public offering last year. Peabody executives were among 30 or 40 industry officials briefed by members of the energy task force in meetings set up last spring by the Edison Electric Institute, the power industry's primary lobbying group.
Frederick D. Palmer, the chief lobbyist for Peabody, said the company met more often with the Clinton administration than it does with the Bush White House because it needed to argue its case more often.
"We're all on the supply side -- the electric utilities, the coal companies -- and the energy plan is basically a supply side plan, but that's not the result of back room deals or lobbying the vice president of the United States," Mr. Palmer said. "People running the United States government now are from the energy industry, and they understand it and believe in increasing the energy supply, and contribution money has nothing do with it."
The largest Republican donors maintain that their contributions did not buy them access. But they did pave the way for the rise of an administration that ultimately supported much of the agenda of the energy industry. "We give money to these people to have a business environment we want to work in," Ms. Wong of Anadarko said. "And the thing we're proposing is to have an increase in the domestic energy supply."

HEADLINE: Russia's Latest Export: Bad Jokes About U.S. Chickens 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 1 

 BODY:
Weary, perhaps, of tolerating American diktats on everything from steel exports to NATO expansion, Russian officials are poised to strike a retaliatory blow at one of the United States' soft spots: its thighs. Chicken thighs.
 Agriculture Minister Aleksei V. Gordeyev said today that his office had stopped issuing permits to import American chicken, the single most popular item from the United States. Within 10 days, he said, Russia may issue an outright ban against American chicken. 
 The issue, he said, is whether American fowl are too foul for Russians to eat. "Russia is not a garbage dump for poor quality food," he told the Interfax news service, "and if specific answers are not received, imports themselves will be stopped from March 10." 
Mr. Gordeyev's pronouncement capped a virtual drumstick-beat of warnings from Russian officials that much of American poultry -- loaded with antibiotics, stuffed with hormones and preservatives and generally unnatural -- presents an unacceptable threat to Russian health.
Others suspect the minister may be reacting to pressure from Russian farmers, who are battling a deluge of cheap American chickens. Still others believe the government is simply playing good politics, showing the Russian flag in the face of what most Russians regard as an insulting American attitude toward them. 
The Moscow business daily Kommersant pretty much summed that up today with an article on the accusations of drug-and-hormone-fed chicken that made a sly reference to the disqualification of Russian skiers at the Salt Lake City Olympics: "They banned chicken for doping," the headline read. 
Puns aside -- difficult as that is -- the chicken flap is no laughing matter to American farmers, who send more birds to Russia than anywhere else. 
American chicken is so popular that the slang term for it is "Bush legs" -- an allusion to the rush of thighs and legs after the first President Bush dispatched food aid to hungry Russians in the early 1990's. 
The National Chicken Council, an American trade group, estimates that Russians consumed a record one million tons of chicken from the United States in 2001 -- in appendage terms, about 1.28 billion legs. 
"Leg quarters are our big items of export," said Richard Lobb, the council spokesman. "Overseas markets prefer dark meat, and U.S. markets prefer the white meat." 
One million tons is 8 percent of the entire United States chicken production, and 61 percent of all the chicken eaten in Russia. More important, it is a 75 percent increase over the American chicken exports to Russia in 2000, a statistic that has sent shivers of alarm through Russia's young poultry industry.
The Russians worry that an American chicken juggernaut threatens to wipe out a domestic poultry industry that was just starting to recover after the financial collapse of 1998.
Russian chickens, which not so long ago resembled underfed robins, have vastly improved in both weight and quality in the last few years, but producers find it hard to compete on price. In part, that is because the farms are inefficient: the Agriculture Ministry says fewer than 20 percent of the chicken farms run at capacity, and nearly 80 percent need reconstruction. 
Ukraine and Estonia, laboring under the same disadvantage, have moved to ban American imports in recent months. Russian farmers have complained bitterly to the agriculture minister about foreign competition, and there has been talk of a five-point increase in tariffs for imported chicken of all kinds. 
Something of a propaganda campaign against the evils of American chickens has also emerged. The Web site www.pravda.ru, an extension of the newspaper, reported acidly on Wednesday that "Bush legs" are hardly known for their tastiness. 
"But the majority of Russian people like their inexpensive price, though they understand that cheap products -- especially if they are of American origin -- are not likely to be good for your health," the article said. 
And TVRK Moscoviya, the television channel of the province that includes Moscow, took a broad shot at American chicken on a recent edition of its "Farmer's Outpost" program. 
"Take the American chicken-leg quarter, roast it, and what do you have left? Only the skin and bone," Yevgeny Elizarov, director of the Concoursni poultry farm, said on the program. "The moisture comes out, but there's no meat there. The foreign birds are vaccinated against 12 diseases, and we don't know what they're feeding the birds." 
That was a windup for the coup de grace: "Have you noticed that they only sell left Bush legs?" Mr. Elizarov told the camera. "That's because all the injections are made into the left leg. It's true! That means there are no right Bush legs on the market, only left ones. It means they don't eat them themselves, but send them over to us. 
"Bon appetit!"

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Indicator Rises For First Time in 18 Months 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A closely watched measure of manufacturing activity rose for the first time in 18 months in February, as a rise in orders and increased production helped bolster industry.
 The Institute for Supply Management in Tempe, Ariz., formerly known as the National Association of Purchasing Management, said yesterday that its index of business activity rose to 54.7 in February from 49.9 in January. An index above 50 signifies expansion, while a figure below 50 shows contraction. 
 Other economic reports released yesterday also showed signs that the recession, which began last March, might be near an end. The government reported that consumer spending and income growth accelerated in January and construction activity surged at the fastest pace in a year. But a crucial index of consumer confidence fell in January.
"It looks like the manufacturing side of the economy is finally back on its feet," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. The manufacturing index is closely watched because it offers an early reading on the health of manufacturing. The index is based on a survey of executives who buy the raw materials for more than 350 companies.
But Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the monthly manufacturing report, warned that factories still had a lot of unused capacity. 
His warning came two days after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, offered a cautious assessment of the economy, telling Congress that a recovery was in the works but that it might be gradual. 
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, rose 0.4 percent in January, its best showing since October. Americans' incomes -- including wages, interest and government benefits -- also rose 0.4 percent. 
The government also reported that construction spending jumped 1.5 percent in January after an increase of 0.5 percent in December, in part because of the mild winter. Richard Berner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, said that even though construction and housing could soften, the economy over all was generating enough momentum to sustain a recovery. 
At the same time, the University of Michigan offered a cautious note, reporting that consumer confidence slipped to 90.7 in February from 93.0 in January. Economists noted that while consumers were cautious, they did expect to improve over the next six months.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Dip in Jobless Rate Stirs Some Optimism in Japan

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 1 

 BODY:
Japan's battered economy received a small dose of positive news today, as the jobless rate unexpectedly fell for the first time in a year.
 The jobs report, which showed unemployment dipping to 5.3 percent in January from 5.5 percent in December, does little to dispel the widespread belief that the current recession will continue at least through midyear. But combined with declines in household spending and exports that were smaller than expected, they suggest that the worst may be over for the economy -- at least for now. 
 The bullish data come as the government has announced a plan to battle deflation and the Bank of Japan has agreed to buy more long-term government bonds and loosen lending requirements.
Investors pushed stocks higher today, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index closing the week up 4.4 percent -- the largest weekly gain in five months. 
A rising stock market and ebbing recession are a boon to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose popularity has plummeted in recent weeks. Mr. Koizumi has pledged to take a more market-oriented stance and to prevent a full-blown financial crisis. 
Those goals have forced the prime minister into some policy contortions, pushing for banks to write off their bad loans while orchestrating a bailout of the country's largest corporate debtor, the retailer Daiei Inc.
But with the economy showing at least tentative signs of touching bottom, Mr. Koizumi stands a better chance of getting through the end of the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, without a major financial meltdown.
Longer term is a different matter. Mr. Koizumi is trying to contain an exploding fiscal deficit by trimming public spending, a move that hurts contractors and others dependent on government largess. Many of Japan's largest manufacturers continue to move production to China, leaving the cream of Japan's blue-collar workers in the lurch. The economy lost 230,000 jobs in January. The exodus, along with record-low interest rates and falling wages, does little to encourage consumer spending.
"The economic data out this week is looking better than people thought," said Matthew Poggi, an economist with Lehman Brothers. "But there are still plenty of structural problems that remain."
Mr. Poggi expects that rising exports, particularly to the United States, will provide at least a mild boost to growth, but that the economy as a whole will shrink about 1 percent this year.
As in past recessions, exporters like Canon Inc. and Honda Motor are often the first companies to benefit in a turnaround. That may not be far off. 
Earlier this week, the government said that exports fell just 1.8 percent in January, the smallest decline in nine months, and that the country's surplus with the United States grew nearly 15 percent. Inventories have also fallen five consecutive months, so manufacturers are likely to benefit from any turnaround in spending.
There are encouraging signs there, too. New-home starts rose 3.5 percent last month, the first gain since August. Household spending, meanwhile, fell half as fast as economists expected.
After years of stop-and-start recoveries, though, economists here are cautious about investing too much in any one set of numbers.

HEADLINE: New York's Taxi Drivers Need Disaster Relief 

BYLINE:  By Bhairavi Desai; Bhairavi Desai is staff coordinator for the New York Taxi Workers Alliance.

 BODY:
In New York City, more than a half-million people depend on yellow cabs every day. But since the economic downturn and the attack on the World Trade Center, the taxi business has been facing hard times. 
 The industry, with roughly 20,000 active yellow taxi drivers, needs about 3,000 more drivers to remain a healthy part of the city's transportation system. As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently noted, however, the taxi business isn't offering enough take-home pay to attract new drivers. A fare increase by the Taxi and Limousine Commission seems likely -- and is necessary. But a fare increase alone won't fix the driver shortage. 
 Yellow taxi drivers' already meager earnings -- on average, about $25,000 a year after expenses -- have gotten even smaller since Sept. 11. In the weeks following the attack, driver incomes fell by 50 percent, according to a Federal Reserve Board report. Meanwhile, most drivers of the city's 12,187 medallion cabs continue to pay high fixed cab-leasing fees -- to garages and brokers that respond to fare increases by raising these leasing fees. (Only 8 percent to 12 percent of full-time drivers own medallions.)
To attract new drivers and keep the ones they have, city regulators must do more than raise fares. They must also lower the maximum allowable leasing fees. At the same time, agencies like The Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency should grant drivers disaster relief -- through a collective fund that could use data from the taxi commission to identify active licensed drivers.
Currently, relief agencies are turning away taxi drivers on the grounds that they are not geographically dependent on lower Manhattan for most of their income. Yet taxi drivers have been directly affected by conditions in lower Manhattan: Statistics compiled in the mid-1990's by Schaller Consulting, a New York-based firm, show that 70 percent of yellow taxi trips transported Manhattan residents and that 80 percent of those involved travel in the business district from 60th Street to Battery Park City. And unlike laid-off hotel or other tourist-industry workers rejected for disaster aid because they work primarily outside the disaster zone, taxi drivers -- considered independent contractors -- can't get unemployment benefits.
What's more, despite the losses they incurred, many drivers were part of the recovery effort following the attack, providing 5,000 free rides to rescue workers and grieving families, according to the taxi commission.
Beyond immediate aid, drivers also need a fare-and-leasing structure that can yield a decent income. Under the current leasing system, the average take-home pay for a 12-hour day shift is about $75. (A 12-hour night shift brings a bit more.) Drivers get no health or vacation benefits; many work 70 hours a week.
The taxi commission is considering a fare increase of 12 percent to 17 percent. But the last time fares went up in 1996, the bulk of the increase was appropriated by cab companies that raised leasing fees. Currently, garages are allowed to charge maximums of $103 for a day-shift cab rental and $112 for a night shift rental.
For drivers to make real gains, the caps on these fees must be lowered. Cab companies will still make money. And as more drivers are lured into the industry by higher incomes, garages and brokers will increase their profits by leasing the hundreds of cabs now idled by the driver shortage.
Recovery from the recession and the terrorist attack will be difficult for all service industries in the city, but especially for taxi drivers. Without help from disaster relief agencies and a fairer leasing structure, there will be even fewer seasoned drivers to impart stability to this industry.

HEADLINE: Notes from Washington; 
The Mayor Picks a Fight

BYLINE:  By Dave McKenna; Dave McKenna is a sports columnist for the Washington City Paper.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Boxing historians will point out there hasn't been a consequential bout held in the District of Columbia since Joe Louis beat Buddy Baer at Griffith Stadium in 1941. Political squabbles have always quenched the local bloodthirst. Now the District's Boxing and Wrestling Commission hopes to regain some boxing notoriety by hosting Mike Tyson in his comeback.
 Tyson's fitness as a fighter isn't above questioning. At a New York press conference in January to promote his then-pending bout with Lennox Lewis, Tyson threw a fist toward a big galoot from the Lewis camp who was standing just a foot away -- and missed. The Nevada Athletic Commission decided that Tyson's brawl-inciting action, coupled with his criminal past and possible ear fetish, proved he wasn't fit to fight in the state. The commission's rejection put the fight, which had been scheduled for April 6 in Las Vegas, up for grabs. But other American cities, wary of Tyson's reputation, have declined to step forward. 
 Then Mayor Anthony Williams made his move. He endorsed the D.C. commission's pursuit of the Tyson-Lewis bout because it could help in the city's economic recovery from Sept. 11. The mayor has spent the past several months quietly standing by as the federal government decides what roads he and his constituents can no longer use and what sites tourists can no longer visit.
Beyond the money the fight could bring to the city (some estimates say upwards of $10 million), the mayor clearly thinks sporting events make the District seem more Big League. He'd love to land the 2012 Olympics and bring baseball back. His biggest catch so far, however, is a motor-sports weekend in July featuring a second-generation daredevil Robbie Knievel.
Not everyone in the District is quite as sanguine about boxing being the way to boost the city's fortunes. City council member Kathy Patterson, not swayed by the economic-recovery argument, asked whether the city was also looking at prostitution to increase tax revenues. The Greater Washington Board of Trade has said that bringing Tyson to the District would reverse the business community's effort to "promote the perceptions of our city in the national and world view." Religious leaders who stood by former Mayor Marion Barry during his darkest hours have not been supportive of the current mayor.
This being Washington, think tanks and lobbyists are also weighing in, finding in Mike Tyson not a boxer but a proxy for their cause. "We don't need Soviet-style economic commissars deciding who can work, and where they can work, and under what conditions they can work," read a press release from the Libertarian Party in support of the bout. The National Organization for Women sent its members into the street to picket the mayor about the fight and issued a statement of its own, noting it was "appalled" that the D.C. Boxing Commission would give Mike Tyson a license to box.
Actually, the commission hasn't granted Tyson the license yet, and won't vote on his application until after a public hearing set for March 12. The mayor's resolve to bring the fight here appeared to be wobbling in the days after his initial announcement, when he embraced the Lewis camp's suggestion that Tyson undergo a psychiatric review before any license is granted. That hurdle surely seems a prelude to a rejection.
No matter how the vote goes, the early rounds of this controversy have already provided a diversion for a town that's been needing one for months. And soon enough, perhaps, Mayor Williams will be able to rely on more than a bizarre boxing sideshow to show the District is getting back to normal. Lost amid the early reports of the possible fight was news that the Washington Monument had reopened for tours.

HEADLINE: Fired by C.I.A., He Says Agency Practiced Bias 

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
As a young case officer at the Central Intelligence Agency, Jeffrey Sterling says, he was eager to begin his first overseas posting, in Bonn, and he relished his secret assignment to recruit Iranians as spies.
 After long hours spent on the Iranian desk at C.I.A. headquarters and nearly a year in language school learning Farsi, he felt that he was ready to put his training to use. 
 But after waiting two months for orders that never arrived, he said, he returned to the agency headquarters in Virginia in the fall of 1997 to ask his bosses why he had not been given any new cases.
The answer stunned him, he said.
According to Mr. Sterling, a supervisor on the Iran Task Force of the agency blurted out why he had not been given new assignments. As a "big black man speaking Farsi," Mr. Sterling "stuck out" and would draw too much attention to the agency's secret Iranian agents. The supervisor, who is white, suggested that a black man, especially a tall athletically built black man like Mr. Sterling, could not meet secretly with Iranians without putting the agency's most sensitive Iranian cases at risk, Mr. Sterling said. 
"He said, 'You kind of stick out as a big black guy,' " Mr. Sterling recalled. "I said, 'When did you realize I was black?' " 
Mr. Sterling said he was a victim of racial discrimination throughout his career at the agency. He has been fired and has sued the agency, which vigorously denies the accusations.
Agency officials said they were prevented from responding to Mr. Sterling's specific statements by his refusal to waive his privacy rights. They said his dismissal stemmed from his refusal to accept a new assignment.
Mr. Sterling, 34 and unemployed, said that he was embittered by his experiences and that he believed he had never been given a fair chance to prove himself inside the agency's clubby atmosphere. 
Agency officials and outside lawyers who handle cases against the agency said Mr. Sterling was the first black case officer to file a racial discrimination suit against the agency. Mr. Sterling said other black case officers shared his feelings but were afraid to speak up. 
"I think they bring minorities in the door to maintain appearances, and so they can say they are diverse," he said of the agency. "But that's just a facade." 
Although the agency has expressed a determination to become more diverse, white men have long dominated its top management. Since the agency started in 1947, every director, deputy director and chief of espionage operations has been a white man.
In the mid-1990's, the white male control over espionage faced its first major legal challenge from a class-action suit by a group of women who were case officers and who charged sexual discrimination. The women won a $990,000 settlement in federal court in 1995. 
Mr. Sterling also said he believed that his experience showed how difficult it had been for the agency to adapt to a changing world.
The failure to develop more case officers from diverse backgrounds, he said, helped explain why the agency was unable to penetrate Al Qaeda's terrorist network before Sept. 11, while an American teenager, John Walker Lindh, was able to join the group. 
"If a skinny white kid from the Bay Area can go up and knock on the door of the Taliban and Al Qaeda and be welcomed in, imagine what a nontraditional C.I.A. officer would have been able to do," Mr. Sterling said. 
John Brennan, the deputy executive director of the agency who met Mr. Sterling several times about his case, said there was no evidence that racial discrimination had caused his problems. 
"It was an unfortunate situation," Mr. Brennan said, "because Jeffrey was a talented officer and had a lot of the skills we are looking for, and we wanted him to succeed.
"We were quite pleased with Jeffrey's performance in a number of areas. Unfortunately, there were some areas of his work and development that needed some improvement." 
In his suit, filed in August in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Sterling contends that he faced a pattern of discrimination throughout his career.
The challenge of Mr. Sterling's fitting in was complicated by the secretive nature of the agency, where even mundane personnel matters are classified. 
Mr. Sterling contends that the managers retaliated against him after he had filed a complaint in 2000 with the antidiscrimination office at the agency over his treatment on his last field assignment, in the New York station. The agency, he said, ordered him to undergo a complete security reinvestigation two years ahead of schedule.
In August 2000, Mr. Sterling was forced to leave the New York station. In March 2001, he was placed on administrative leave. He said he was subsequently discharged for refusing an assignment to return to the Iran Task Force, although agency officials said he refused other possible assignments, as well. He was let go in October.
Mr. Sterling and others familiar with his case said they believed that he and other young black case officers lacked mentors to help them navigate the byzantine world of espionage early in their careers.
Agency officials said they were working to improve recruiting and developing employees from minorities. About 12 percent of the professional staff members of the Directorate of Operations, the espionage arm where Mr. Sterling worked, are members of minorities, agency officials said. 
"The agency has been very serious about diversity, and we have a very intense recruitment effort," said Don Cryer, a special assistant to the director of the agency, George J. Tenet, for diversity plans and programs. "Our numbers are rising in all the key areas."
Mr. Cryer said he had also met Mr. Sterling before his dismissal.
"The agency really did try to find a way to help Jeffrey be successful," Mr. Cryer said, "because we truly did see him as an employee with potential." 
In fact, Mr. Sterling was just the sort of person whom the agency has said it wants to recruit.
Raised in Cape Girardeau, Mo., the youngest of six children, Mr. Sterling was the sole member of his family to go to college. After graduating from Millikin University in Decatur, Ill., he earned a law degree from Washington University in St. Louis. After that, he responded to a newspaper advertisement from the Central Intelligence Agency and was hired in 1993.
In December 1994, he completed training to become a case officer and joined the Iran Task Force in January 1995. He was the sole black officer there out of 20 to 30 professional staff members, he said. In that unit, Mr. Sterling traveled to Africa and Europe to work with Iranian agents.
After his training in Farsi, followed by another period at headquarters while he went through a divorce, Mr. Sterling was sent to Bonn in September 1997, assigned to recruiting Iranians as agents. 
But, he said, his efforts to meet Iranian diplomats were hampered because his "cover," the position he had to pretend to hold while operating for the C.I.A., was as an Army logistics officer. He said his superiors denied his request to switch him to a State Department cover, so he could pose as an American diplomat and move more freely among foreign officials. 
While he handled one or two existing cases in Germany, he said, he was not given new cases to develop.
After meeting his supervisors in November 1997, when Mr. Sterling said he was told that he had not been given new cases because his appearance was a hindrance, he demanded that he be allowed to leave Germany, and he returned to headquarters. 
After nearly a year in the counterproliferation division, Mr. Sterling transferred to New York in January 1999, where, he said, he was the lone black case officer. 
Again, he was assigned to try to recruit Iranians as spies, and soon received a positive evaluation. Mr. Sterling "demonstrated good tradecraft in the handling of his assigned cases," according to an evaluation in September 1999 by a supervisor and provided by Mr. Sterling. 
But soon after that, managers in New York began to tell Mr. Sterling that they were disappointed by his failure to recruit Iranian spies. Mr. Sterling again complained that he had been given a cover as an Army officer and he again requested a State Department cover. Again, he said, that request was denied. 
In April 2000, Mr. Sterling met his New York supervisors and was told that he had two months to start recruiting three new spies, and hold three meetings with each, or he would be forced to leave the station. 
Mr. Sterling said he saw that as an unrealistic and unfair deadline and rejected the terms. He now says white case officers were routinely given more time to meet less demanding standards. He filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity office at the agency and said he was soon notified that he would be subjected to a security investigation.
Robert Baer, a former case officer and the writer of a new book on his career at the agency, agreed that the demands put on Mr. Sterling for developing new agents were unreasonable. 
"It's incomprehensible to me why any manager would give anyone a two-month limit," Mr. Baer said. "That's an outrageous requirement. It often occurs that people go a whole tour of two or three years who don't recruit a single agent." 
Mr. Sterling said that perhaps the most depressing part of his experience occurred on Sept. 11, when the terrorist attacks occurred just as the agency was dismissing him.
"I was trained by the organization to counter enemies like that," he said. "I had the language and area familiarization, but I was still not considered good enough."

HEADLINE: The Worsening Drought 

 BODY:
As the Northeastern drought intensifies -- warm dry days followed by cold dry days -- jurisdictions around the region have begun to make plans for an official drought emergency, with mandatory restrictions in water use, even as they fervently hope for wet weather. Except for the cold and the leafless trees, the region's streams and reservoirs have the look of a hot, dry summer about them, and it is still only the beginning of March. 
 Even if rain appears this weekend, meteorologists believe that we will pull out of this drought slowly, too slowly to refill the reservoirs by early summer. Everyone hopes that spring, usually a very wet season, will bring normal rainfall. But nothing has been normal, weather-wise, in quite some time. 
 A prolonged drought is a little like hard economic times, if only because it makes bad decisions and wasted opportunities so noticeable. Suddenly, the sources of water that are no longer available thanks to groundwater pollution or ill-considered development loom large in the overall water-supply picture. In a severe drought, they might have made a difference. The same is true for patterns of water use that wouldn't seem profligate in years of normal moisture but that suddenly seem extravagant now. 
These days, every drought is read against the background of global warming. There is as yet no incontrovertible evidence of a connection between the two; what we do know is that, as with global warming, we are not without answers if we are willing to face the problem. One, obviously, is conservation. After a drought warning was issued last month, New Yorkers cut the city's water consumption by 30 million gallons a day. 
Meanwhile, a sustained spring dousing, a few weeks of the soaking weather that makes everyone complain, would go a long way toward taking our minds off these worrying matters. It would certainly ease, for the moment, the worries of city planners, who have reopened wells in Queens and have been making contingency plans in the event of severe drought. But even if spring is wet and summer wetter, the long-range betting is on more dry times to come. Conservation should become a habit with us, conservation and a far more longsighted and imaginative use of an increasingly precious resource.

HEADLINE: Head of Miss America Pageant Resigns, Citing Board Disagreements 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
The head of the Miss America Pageant resigned yesterday after a two-year tenure in which he threatened to move the money-losing event out of Atlantic City and cut budgets. He also solicited new sponsors and licensed Miss America slot machines and other merchandise to resurrect the 81-year-old dowager's finances.
 It was unclear last night if the departure of Robert M. Renneisen Jr., 55, as the pageant's $250,000-a-year president and chief executive was a dismissal or a voluntary withdrawal. He declined to comment when reached by telephone, but issued a brief written statement referring to disagreements with his board. 
 The move was "negotiated on amicable terms and both regretted the necessity for the decision," it said. "Both the board and I want only success for the Miss America organization. However, it has become clear that we differ in our definition of success and on the means necessary to achieve it. Perhaps a change in leadership will bring new perspectives to the many challenges facing this organization."
While the disagreements were not spelled out, the resignation comes only weeks after an attempted coup by directors of some state pageants and after angry complaints from mentors and relatives of the current Miss America, Katie Harmon, who accused Mr. Renneisen of depriving her of press opportunities and even short-changing her on bills for clothing alterations.
The pageant said that Mr. Renneisen would be succeeded temporarily by George Bauer, 58, the second-ranking official. Mr. Renneisen is the pageant's third top official in four years, and the second to go before his contract expired. His predecessor, Robert L. Beck, was ousted after he proposed to end a long-standing ban on contestants who were divorced or had had an abortion.
A former casino and marketing executive, Mr. Renneisen had a host of ideas for modernizing a pageant that had evolved over the years from a bathing beauty contest into a competition that combined talent and personality and promoted images of young women with ideas about culture, politics and their communities.
The trouble was that the pageant was losing money, and traditional sources of revenue had begun to wither, along with the national television audience. The 2000 pageant had the lowest ratings in the event's 43 years on television: only 8.8 million homes tuned in, compared with 22 million in 1970.
Last year, 13.5 million viewers were watching, but revenue was not nearly enough to cover the organization's expenses. ABC paid $5.8 million for the broadcast rights to the September pageant, a sum Mr. Renneisen recently said had been shrinking in recent years.
"When the company hired me two years ago, given this economic paradigm, we knew we must begin to increase and expand our sources of revenue from other areas," Mr. Renneisen said in an interview a few weeks ago. "Clothing, jewelry, T-shirts, dolls, whatever."
Mr. Renneisen's proposal to license Miss America slot machines for casinos drew immediate fire from a number of state pageant officials, who characterized the idea as demeaning to the wholesome image the organization has tried to promote. Nevertheless, he said he had reached an agreement with a slot-machine maker.
The dispute exposed something of a culture clash in the pageant, setting state directors in California, Oregon, Illinois, Texas and other states -- some of whom had long shunned two-piece bathing suits for contestants -- against Mr. Renneisen.
Last December, Mr. Renneisen threatened to move the pageant out of Atlantic City, where it had been founded in 1921, unless the city, which has been paying about $500,000 annually, came up with $1 million more. He said that the location of the pageant was a license he could sell, and that the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Conn., had offered $1.5 million.
Atlantic City's Convention and Visitor's Bureau, perhaps sensing a bluff, said it would not pay the additional money, and the pageant's board voted unanimously to remain in Atlantic City for at least one more year.
More tensions arose in January at a Las Vegas workshop sponsored by the national organization. Timothy Crammer, a New Jersey lawyer who represents the National Association of Miss America State Pageants, said that several state officials complained that Mr. Renneisen did not promptly return the calls of potential sponsors solicited by the state groups.
The state directors appealed to the Miss America Organization board, and at a meeting on Feb. 4 presented what one state official called a "book of grievances" against Mr. Renneisen. Two state officials asked for his resignation.
In response, Mr. Renneisen said the volunteers who run state pageants did not grasp the size of the economic problems of the national organization.

HEADLINE: They Give, but They Also Take: Voters Muddle States' Finances 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: PHOENIX, March 1 

 BODY:
The voters of Arizona have spoken. They want lower taxes. They also want higher taxes -- but only if they go to the state's beleaguered public schools, consistently ranked among the worst in the nation.
 The people of Colorado have spoken as well. They passed a constitutional amendment that limits how much state government can spend or take in, even in flush times. But then a few years later they passed another amendment, calling for guaranteed annual increases in education spending. Pay for it however possible, the voters seemed to be saying, but do not raise our taxes. 
 In Washington State, the voters have sent a similar mixed message. By a sizable majority, people voted in 1999 to cut taxes. But the next year an even bigger majority voted to spend $800 million to give teachers annual raises and reduce class size, without also offering any new money to pay for the initiatives. 
Call them unfinanced mandates from the people. Now all three states are facing crushing deficits and may have to close parks, delay road construction, close hospitals and reduce police officers in rural areas. Standard & Poor's has warned Colorado that its credit rating may be downgraded.
Still, the voter message seems to be, Deal with it.
As state legislators struggle to find ways to adhere to the popular will, some are now wondering whether it was a good idea to let people shape big chunks of the budget by voter initiatives, leaving the messy details to lawmakers.
Some state politicians have even coined a term for their new diminished role. They call themselves the Bypass Legislature. In the last 10 years, the number of states where voters have put budgetary strictures on their elected officials has practically doubled, to 13.
At the same time, in the 24 states where lawmaking by ballot is permitted, voters went on a spending spree of their own, mandating money for drug treatment, schools, parks and roads.
Voter initiatives have never been particularly popular with state lawmakers, who see their job as taxing and spending. But most of what voters did was largely inconsequential in the prosperous 1990's. Now, in the midst of a lingering recession and increased cost for domestic security, the bill is coming due, and in a growing number of states, expenses and revenues do not add up.
More than 40 states have a budget shortage. And unlike the federal government, these budgets are required by law to be balanced.
"This makes my job very difficult," said Nancy McCallin, the budget director for Colorado. "But the voters pay the taxes, and if they are telling us this is how they want us to run things, we have to do it."
Voter moods can vary. Colorado is now trying find a way to make up a two-year budget shortage of about $700 million, in part because of new voter-mandated spending programs. But the state is also scrounging for a way to give about $1 billion back to taxpayers in voter-mandated refunds, which was deferred.
In the West, where taxing and spending by initiative has a strong tradition, the balancing act is particularly difficult.
"I wouldn't say voters are stupid," said Phil Talmadge, a former Washington Supreme Court judge and legislator. "But the same voter who wants unlimited services also does not want to pay for it. There's a disconnect."
Voter initiatives, Mr. Talmadge said, were created nearly a hundred years ago because people did not trust their legislators to act for the public good. But in recent years, such initiatives have grown in popularity and importance.
"What happened in the 1990's is that special interests decided it was a lot cheaper to buy initiatives than buy legislators," Mr. Talmadge said.
The result, he said, is that Democrats used the initiative process for new spending programs on education, health care and the environment, and Republicans used it to cut taxes or limit states' ability to raise taxes. Many voters punched yes for both sides.
"This puts us in somewhat of a civic death spiral," said Richard Davis, president of the Washington Research Council, a nonpartisan public policy research group in Seattle. "You give the voters an up or down without any nuance. They are reacting to a line item, and they never have to deliberate, as legislators do."
The message in the states where voters can basically do the job that elected officials were once primarily charged with doing, Mr. Davis said, "is not liberal or conservative -- it's reactive."
Others who have studied the initiative patterns agree.
"Where direct democracy becomes a more dominant force than representative government the result is a whipsaw, without any long-term coherence," said Brian Weberg, an official with the National Conference of State Legislatures.
People on both sides of the political spectrum say the system has gotten out of control. Lawmakers in some states have called for hearings on the initiative process. Still, these states with strong initiative powers have populist traditions, and lawmakers are loath to mess with the majority sentiment, however contradictory that can seem.
"Legislators don't want to do anything because it may be viewed as tinkering with the will of the people," said Daniel A. Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Denver.
Washington State legislators, for instance, now seem cowed by the initiative, Mr. Davis said. When people voted to cut the annual car- registration fee to a flat fee of $30 from $500 or more, depending on the year and model of the car, officials argued that the measure would increase the state's deficit. But when the State Supreme Court threw out the measure, legislators, with the aid of Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, resurrected the issue, made the $30 car-registration fee the law and said it was the will of the people.
Now Washington is struggling to finance road construction to ease Seattle's chronic traffic congestion. But legislative leaders from both parties say they are afraid to raise gasoline taxes to pay for new roads without first putting it to a vote of the people.
Here in Arizona, voters passed a 1992 constitutional amendment making it almost impossible for the Legislature to raise taxes. But in the late 1990's, during boom times, voters started mandating by initiative more money for health care and education.
To make sure state politicians got the message, voters passed another measure that said the lawmakers could not undo what the voters had just decided to do.
In the 2000 election, Arizona voters decided to raise the amount of money spent on schools every year. They also said lawmakers could not use school money for other purposes. But, several legislators say, the fund created for the schools does not have enough money to satisfy the law that says schools must be given a certain amount every year.
In part because of the dual mandates from voters, Arizona is now facing a deficit of up to $2 billion over this year and next. Washington's shortage is about $1.6 billion, and Colorado has a $700 million hill to climb.
"It's a mess," said Panfilo Contreras, executive director of the Arizona School Boards Association. "What's happening now is we're getting our comeuppance for what we've been doing over the last 10 years."
Mr. Contreras says voters realized that voting to restrict taxes and revenue 10 years ago was a mistake, because schools and health facilities in the state fell apart. Now the voters are more educated, he said, and are trying to undo piecemeal what they did earlier.
Others have a different interpretation, saying voters are inconsistent.
So Arizona legislators continue meeting here, now in their third special session over the last year, trying to figure out exactly what the voters intended while having to make large, unpopular cuts. Nearly 60 percent of the budget cannot be touched, under orders from the people.
"We have become somewhat of a Bypass Legislature state," said Francie Noyes, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jane Dee Hull, a Republican. "We have very little flexibility, particularly in hard times, to make budget decisions because of all the demands from voter initiatives."

HEADLINE: Chevrolet Sales Surpass Ford's For First Time In 10 Years 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 1 

 BODY:
Chevrolet outsold the Ford brand in February for the first month in more than a decade, industry figures showed today, further highlighting the resurgence of the General Motors Corporation and the struggles of the Ford Motor Company. 
 George Pipas, Ford's manager of industry sales analysis, said of G.M. during a conference call about February sales that "I would say congratulations if they've managed to pull that off." 
 He quickly added that Ford was not so concerned about its signature brand's trailing Chevrolet after the first two months of the year. 
"This is not Nascar," he said. "You don't get points for lap leadership. What counts is the end of the year." 
But in a city where every tenth of a percent of market share is agonized over every month, Ford's latest stumble was a significant milestone in the shifting competitive terrain.
"Does it drive Dearborn crazy? Absolutely," said Gerald Meyers, a professor at the University of Michigan and the former chief executive of American Motors, referring to Ford, which is based in Dearborn, Mich.
"They live that," he added. "The whole company lives the who's-on-top game."
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for global market and industry analysis, announced on his company's conference call that "Chevrolet won the gold medal."
G.M. appears determined to hold the line on its market share by driving up incentive costs while Ford and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, are in weakened positions and are struggling to regain profitability.
G.M. said today that it would extend its aggressive $2,002 rebate offers through March and would bring back some of the interest-free financing deals that it offered at the end of last year.
Executives at both Ford and Chrysler have complained about the incentive battle, but the two companies have largely been forced to match the G.M. offers to stay competitive.
Today, Ford officials said that the company would extend its interest-free financing and its rebate offers and add bonuses of as much as $1,500 for customers who renew leases.
The incentives have been great news for consumers but have not helped the automakers' bottom lines. Last year, Ford lost $5.5 billion and Chrysler $1.9 billion; G.M. managed a net profit of $601 million. 
Even with the incentives, Ford and Chrysler have been pressed to stem eroding market shares. Last month, sales at G.M. rose by less than half a percent, but sales at Ford and Chrysler fell about 11 percent. G.M.'s market share rose to 31.2 percent from 29.9 percent in the month a year ago, while Ford's fell to 20.4 percent from 22.3 percent and Chrysler's fell to 14.8 percent from 16 percent. 
Over all, United States auto sales fell 3.4 percent but were better than expected, given the weak economy and the strong sales at this time last year. Some took the performance as an indication that the economy was improving.
"I guess the recession is milder and the hangover from zero percent financing is milder than expected," said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities.
"Affordability has got to be a factor in there," he added. "Cars are cheaper relative to incomes than they ever have been, despite the recession."
Sales of foreign brands continue to keep the pressure on the Big Three. Sales at Toyota, the fourth-largest automaker in the American market, rose 1.7 percent in February from the month a year ago, though Honda sales fell 4.6 percent. Nissan sales rose 10.4 percent from last February, and sales of BMW rose 14 percent. 
Even so, the most significant news was symbolic. The Ford brand had not been surpassed in monthly sales since Chevrolet last beat it in July 1991, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. Chevrolet's sales were up 4.4 percent, driven entirely by surging sales of big trucks like the Silverado and the Avalanche. For Chevrolet and G.M. in general, sales of passenger cars fell substantially but were offset by the company's pickups and sport utility vehicles. Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup were flat and sales of its sport utilities slowed. 
The looming question is how long Chevrolet can stay on top. 
"Ordinarily, I would say it's not sustainable, but these are not ordinary times," Mr. Meyers said. "G.M. is piling on now. I was really shocked to see them restore the zero percent financing. That's a real loser to the auto companies." 
"It's a battle best fought by people with deep pockets," he added. "Who's got deep pockets these days? Not Chrysler, not Ford, it's only G.M. now" among the Big Three.
G.M. also took a competitive poke at Ford in the bond market today when it raised $3.3 billion from the sale of 30-year bonds that can be converted into stock. The sale was smaller than the $5 billion Ford raised in a bond sale in January, but G.M. received a better price.
The offering was popular with investors, who bought more bonds than G.M. had originally intended to sell, said Fred Fiddle, a managing director at Merrill Lynch & Company, which co-managed the bond sale with Morgan Stanley. The success of the offering came as little surprise to Merrill's brokers. Word among them this week was that failure was not an option because Merrill's president, E. Stanley O'Neal, has a seat on G.M.'s board.

HEADLINE: If Not One Problem, It's Another, For the Struggling Giant Qwest 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Qwest Communications International continues to market itself to Wall Street as the model phone company of the future, but all that investors seem interested in is how the voice and data communications giant plans to survive the present. 
 Analysts see little chance of the kind of rapid plunge into bankruptcy that struck Enron, Global Crossing and other go-go companies of the late 1990's. But Qwest, based in Denver, faces a cash squeeze severe enough to have forced the company to draw down a $4 billion credit line with banks. The company is also confronting doubts about its growth prospects and a controversy over its accounting practices that has generated shareholder lawsuits. 
 Some investors were further unnerved when Qwest reported early last month that the Securities and Exchange Commission had subpoenaed records of its transactions with Global Crossing as part of the S.E.C.'s investigation of Global Crossing's accounting. Qwest's shares, which traded at $64.50 two years ago, closed Friday at $8.99. 
The slump in confidence in Qwest comes at a delicate time in its relations with state and federal regulators. Starting this spring with Arizona and Colorado, Qwest expects to begin seeking permission to enter the long-distance phone business in the 14-state Western region in which it is the dominant local phone company. 
The applications represent the culmination of a $3 billion effort to upgrade services and link competitors to the network that Qwest acquired in its takeover of the regional Bell company U S West in 2000. The investments were aimed at satisfying Section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which barred U S West and the other regional Bells from offering long-distance service in their territories unless they could demonstrate that competitors had access to the local networks the Bells monopolized. 
Analysts say Qwest, which had revenue of $19.7 billion last year, could pick up another $1.5 billion to $2 billion by adding long-distance business in its region. It already markets long-distance service in 25 areas outside its territory. 
State regulators in Qwest's region say they are impressed that the company has raised a network once widely derided as "U S Worst" to the top of the rankings for many service standards tracked by the Federal Communications Commission. The regulators say that neither Qwest's financial health nor its accounting practices are factors in the Section 271 reviews. But Qwest is not counting on rivals to miss any chance to raise challenges that could impede the process. 
"This stuff is like an N.B.A. game," said Afshin Mohebbi, Qwest's president and chief operating officer. "There's much more contact under the basket than you can see from the stands." 
Qwest's effort to reassure Wall Street has become nearly a full-time job for Joseph P. Nacchio, its chief executive, who has been holding weekly conference calls with investors and analysts since mid-February to "answer all questions and clear all the rumors." 
Mr. Nacchio has also been traveling to private meetings with large investors, reviewing Qwest's health with credit agencies and participating in negotiations for new financial agreements with banks.
Qwest's assets include a global network of 190,000 miles of high-capacity optical fiber, as well as the nation's fourth-largest long-distance business and extensive Web site operating and Internet service businesses. But 25 million of Qwest's 30 million customers and 75 percent of its revenue last year came from the U S West region, which sprawls from the state of Washington to Minnesota and Arizona.
Many industry analysts endorse Qwest's belief that the winners in its industry will be hybrid companies that meld new-economy broadband services on a global scale with traditional local phone operations. As the economy has slowed, though, Wall Street has grown increasingly skeptical that Qwest will emerge as a pacesetter. 
Some analysts also say that Qwest has vastly overestimated the earnings potential of the empire it borrowed so heavily to build. The most pessimistic say the telecommunications industry is destined for the kind of chronic overcapacity that has produced decades of losses in the capital-intensive steel industry. 
"The math of many business models simply does not work," Scott C. Clelland, an analyst at the Precursor Group in Washington, wrote in a recent report. 
Mr. Clelland said that Qwest was not in immediate danger of failing like numerous smaller communications companies but that it was too small to survive on its own in the long run. Despite the drop in its stock price, however, Qwest has too much debt to attract a suitor in the current economic climate, he said.
Most of the decline in Qwest's share price came last year as the telecommunications sector was tanking, but the 36.4 percent drop since the beginning of this year indicates that Qwest's credibility has dropped to new lows. 
"Enough is enough," said Blaine Marder, a portfolio manager for Iridian Asset Management in Westport, Conn. Iridian owned 7.1 million Qwest shares at the end of 2001, but sold the last of its holdings early last month. 
Part of the problem involves accounting procedures and transactions that have undermined faith in Qwest's reported sales, expense and profit figures. Qwest says it has adhered to generally accepted accounting principles. But some investors find less comfort than they used to from such explanations because Wall Street had heard the same claims from companies like Enron and Global Crossing.
For many investors, though, the most disturbing development came in mid-February, when reports emerged that Qwest was having trouble borrowing in the commercial paper markets. Those markets, in which companies sell interest-bearing notes for periods ranging from a few days to a few months to institutions like money market funds, are a major source of flexible, relatively low-cost cash. 
Ultimately, Qwest exited the commercial paper market and drew down its $4 billion credit line with banks. It was a stop-gap measure that put off a financial reckoning for a few months, but credit agencies responded by slicing the rating on its bonds to near junk status. 
Mr. Nacchio said yesterday that if no steps were taken to improve the balance sheet, the company would be in violation of its agreements with banks by the end of June. But, he said, Qwest is renegotiating those agreements, and, in any event, has numerous actions in progress to prevent such a default, reverse the most recent cut in the company's credit rating and re-enter the commercial paper market.
He said the company was considering raising $500 million to $1 billion by packaging receivables as securities that could be sold to investors. Qwest had previously said it might raise $1.25 billion by selling short-term bonds that automatically convert into stock -- so-called equity-linked securities. Other assets on the market include Qwest's highly profitable Yellow Pages business, which had revenue of $1.6 billion last year, and some rural phone lines that Qwest says may be attractive to small phone companies that are eligible for federal subsidies.
While Qwest might sell these assets, it could meet its financial needs by selling as little as half of any one of them, Mr. Mohebbi said. "We feel we are in a position to dictate terms," he said.

HEADLINE: Damning (Yet Desiring) Mickey and the Big Mac 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
"Why do they hate us?" One answer to that now familiar question may be its opposite: "Why do they love us?"
 American popular culture, American film, American pop music, American fast food and American television manage to inspire both love and hate, as if the two passions were inseparable parts of a single whole, evoking the video image last fall of Osama bin Laden wearing what appeared to be a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch. So while the Taliban tried to quash the cultural influences of the West -- hanging televisions from trees like electronic corpses -- Afghan women were risking their lives by secretly going to Western-style beauty parlors. 
 One explanation for this repulsion and attraction has become fairly common: American popular culture is capitalist culture. In capitalism commodities are produced that will spur desire for still more commodities. Capitalism seduces through sheer force of marketing and sheer promise of pleasure. What fundamentalist society would not be horrified by the ways in which traditions and rituals are subsumed by the filthy lucre of the marketplace? 
This view of popular culture has a long heritage. In "The Communist Manifesto" Marx and Engels described capitalism as intrinsically unsettling, disrupting social conditions, creating "everlasting uncertainty and agitation." Attacks by intellectuals on popular culture in the 1940's and 50's expanded this view. In 1953 Dwight Macdonald wrote in his famous essay "A Theory of Mass Culture" that mass culture was "imposed from above," that it created "passive consumers." 
"Like 19th-century capitalism," Macdonald wrote, "Mass Culture is a dynamic, revolutionary force, breaking down the old barriers of class, tradition, taste, and dissolving all cultural distinctions." It is a kind of cultural indenture imposed by what he called the "Lords of kitsch." The philosopher Theodor Adorno also argued that mass culture was an instrument of oppressive power. He believed that it had a totalitarian dimension; television, he said in a 1954 essay, was "a medium of undreamed-of psychological control." 
Those ideas have now become unquestioned axioms, elaborated on by other critics and analysts. Oddly, those views are also not that far from what Islamic fundamentalists themselves believe, or, for that matter, what the antiglobalization activists believe: pop culture succeeds because it is imperialist. 
The problem is that these images of passive victims of the capitalist maw, enthralled by a cavalcade of meaningless commodities, bears very little relationship to most people's experiences and does little to explain the allure of popular culture. The connection between popular culture and capitalism is hardly as definite as it may seem. As the sociologist Daniel Bell has pointed out, traditional capitalism, with its requirements for restraint and planning, is not easily reconciled with the unbounded desires and ambitions of popular culture. Capitalism has changed in response to culture just as culture has changed in response to capitalism. 
In addition, acceptance of capitalism does not require acceptance of popular culture. Fundamentalist governments and nondemocratic countries like China may seek the prosperity created by modified capitalism without changing their views of American cultural influence; capitalist France and Canada have, at different times, made cultural resistance national policy. 
So capitalism offers limited explanations. More powerful influences shape culture. Alexis de Tocqueville, for example, argued in "Democracy in America" that there was a fundamental difference between the artistic culture of an aristocracy and that of a democracy. In an aristocracy, members of the nobility form a small class with fixed interests, inspiring a uniform style among artisans and creators. Attention is paid to detailed craftsmanship, and artistry is a form of service.
But in a democracy, Tocqueville said, there are no restrictions of class or guild on either artisans or their public. Styles are less firmly defined; social arrangements are more fluid; human aspirations vary widely. So artisans offer what Tocqueville called "imperfect satisfaction" for diverse audiences rather than perfection for the few. Tocqueville also accurately anticipated the nature of pop culture: democracy, he wrote, shifts the preoccupation of art from the soul to the body, from the ideal to the real. 
Similar characteristics were described by John Stuart Mill in "On Liberty" as he heralded the growth of liberal culture. With equality and mobility, he wrote, citizens "now read the same things, listen to the same things, go to the same places, have their hopes and fears directed to the same objects, have the same rights and liberties, and the same means of asserting them." 
With this expansion of attention to the same things and places, commercial culture has also become more vital. Marshall McLuhan once recalled in a 1947 essay an American Army officer's pondering the difficulty of democratizing fascist Italy after World War II. "Democratic freedom," the officer argued, with tongue partly in cheek, required not worrying about politics but "worrying about the means of defeating underarm odor, scaly scalp, hairy legs, dull complexion, unruly hair, borderline anemia, athlete's foot, and sluggish bowels." Once relieved of concerns about caste and material need, the individual is free to address other issues.
McLuhan argued that these material concerns were not to be condemned. Rather, the "luxuriant and prurient chaos of human passions," he wrote, are unavoidable. These passions were acknowledged by the American founding fathers, McLuhan said, and the recognition of those desires helped shape both the realism and the utopianism of American culture. 
So American popular culture offers a powerful promise. Luxuriant and prurient passions are partially satisfied; desires for autonomy are offered fulfillment; material pleasures and possibilities become palpable. Choices are freely made. Who can resist such a siren song? But there is a cost to this shedding of restrictions; there is something inherently disruptive about popular culture. It undermines the elite values of aristocratic art, displaces the customs of folk culture and opposes any limitation on art's audiences or subjects. It asserts egalitarian tastes, encourages dissent and does not shun desire. 
"Mass Culture," Dwight Macdonald wrote, "is very, very democratic: it absolutely refuses to discriminate against, or between, anything or anybody." This is also a reason for intellectuals' fear of its onslaught. As the art critic Clement Greenberg pointed out in the 1940's when these issues first reared their heads, "all the verities involved by religion, authority, tradition, style, are thrown into question." With the coming of "universal literacy," he argued, came a debased form of art: kitsch. And kitsch, he uncannily observed, was going "on a triumphal tour of the world," creating what he called "the first universal culture ever beheld." 
This is even more true now than it was a half-century ago. Popular culture has become the standard-bearer for modernity, heralding its transformations. But for fundamentalists and many terrorists, that is the very problem. Even among mainstream intellectuals, some effects of popular culture are scorned. Popular culture may be hailed by left-wing critics for its liberating energy, but it is also condemned by others as an opiate; among conservatives, it is feared for its nihilistic influence on tastes and morals. 
What then, if anything, can or should be done, since the triumph of popular culture seems so inseparable from the virtues of democratic culture? Is there any way both to promise liberty and the pursuit of happiness while preserving some discrimination among desires and differences among cultures? Or are disgust and desire doomed to be intertwined? Answers are not likely to appease Islamic totalitarianism, but they are increasingly important for the evolution of American democracy and culture.

HEADLINE: State Department Post for Cheney Daughter 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
Liz Cheney, daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney, will start work at the State Department within weeks as a deputy assistant secretary of state in the Near East bureau, the agency's spokesman said today. 
 The spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said she would have an economic portfolio, which another United States official described as a mandate to promote economic liberalization and American trade and investment in the region. 
 Deputy assistant secretaries typically enter an executive corps distinct from most federal employees. According to government Web sites, the positions pay between $126,000 and $138,000 a year to workers based in Washington.
Mr. Boucher said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had known Ms. Cheney for some time and that she was a "very highly skilled individual" who would bring important talents to the post, which had been vacant for more than a year.
"We're delighted to have Ms. Cheney join our team," Mr. Boucher said. "She brings a very strong legal and economic background to her new position, having previously served with both the private and government sectors, including with U.S.A.I.D. and the Department of State," Mr. Boucher said.

HEADLINE: Steel's 40 Percent Solution 

BYLINE:  By Barbara A. Mikulski; Senator Barbara A. Mikulski is a Democrat from Maryland.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President George W. Bush faces an important choice on steel. He can act to level the playing field for American steel producers and workers. Or he can allow years of unfair foreign trade to destroy a critical domestic industry.
 Our nation's steel industry is in crisis. In the past four years, 31 companies have gone under, tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs and hundreds of thousands of retirees may be in danger of losing their health benefits. 
 But this crisis goes beyond the realms of jobs and community. The industry is critical to our nation's defense. As President Bush told steelworkers last year: "Steel is an important job issue. It's also an important national security issue."
The cause of the current crisis is well known. In the words of Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans: "For over 50 years, foreign government intervention and foreign government subsidies have distorted the market for steel." The Russian government, for example, keeps approximately 1,000 unprofitable steel plants open through subsidies. And South Korea has nearly doubled its production capacity since 1990 -- without the domestic demand to support the increase. Altogether, millions of tons of foreign steel are dumped -- sold below production costs -- in the United States every year to keep such foreign mills in business. Last year, the United States imported 30 million tons of steel -- 24 percent of the steel we used -- from Russia, Japan, Brazil and Korea. In October, the United States International Trade Commission, an independent federal advisory group, unanimously found that America's steel industry has been substantially injured by increased imports.
A 40 percent tariff on a broad range of steel imports would give American producers a fighting chance. Indeed, without such a tariff, the remaining American steel companies won't have the breathing room they need to start consolidating instead of liquidating or laying off workers.
Right now, American steel companies and their employees are doing what it takes to be competitive. Companies have closed down inefficient mills and invested in new technology. Many mills -- such as Sparrows Point near Baltimore -- are among the most efficient in the world. Steelworkers, meanwhile, have made painful concessions in their contracts. Many have lost jobs as the industry has become more labor-efficient.
But none of this will matter if the American market continues to be a dumping ground for foreign steel. Now Washington must do its part.
President Bush rightly said that when steel is threatened, our economy and our national security are both threatened. American steel built the railroads and bridges that keep our country connected. Steel built our cities. And during World War II and the Vietnam War, American steel rolled out gun barrels, produced steel for grenades and supplied the shipyards that built the American fighting fleet. 
But saving the steel industry is not just an exercise in nostalgia. Most recently, Bethlehem Steel produced the armor to repair the U.S.S. Cole. As the war on terrorism continues, the industry may again be called on to contribute to our national defense. At times of war or national emergency, we can't afford to be vulnerable to the whims of foreign suppliers.
A 40 percent tariff will not only support our national security. It will also protect the welfare of our steelworkers. More than a million Americans -- active and retired steelworkers and their families -- depend on this industry for their livelihoods, pensions and health care. If President Bush will act now to stop the dumping, we can better secure the future of these workers and retirees.
I am not a fan of trade barriers. But opening up trade shouldn't be an excuse for destroying a basic American industry. Rarely has a case for tariffs been so clear cut. The usual rhetoric of "free" and "fair" trade is meaningless when some of our trading partners aren't playing by the same rules. American steel needs help now.

HEADLINE: Cigarette Tax Would Cost State Millions, Critic Says 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
Topping the list of things Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is asking for from Albany this year is permission to raise the cigarette tax to $1.50 a pack, a budget-balancing measure that the city is touting as pain-free for the state. But one budget critic, citing the city's own estimates, says the measure could cost the state more than $200 million in lost revenue.
 According to the city's estimates, the tax increase would raise $249 million even as it caused sales to drop by 165 million packs, or nearly 50 percent. That would cost the state, which also taxes cigarettes, $247.5 million; the loss could be partly made up if people went to other parts of the state, instead of, say, New Jersey, to buy their cigarettes. 
 "It illustrates the folly of simultaneously treating tobacco as a public health nuisance and a public finance treasure chest," said E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group.
But the city defends its proposal. "Any loss of revenue by the state would be outweighed by lower health care costs brought on by a reduction in smoking-related illnesses," said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor. "The mayor has said he'd love to see the revenue on this tax go flat, to zero."
Part of the problem, Mr. McMahon says, is that both the city and the state are turning to the tobacco trough in these lean economic times. The city, which now levies a tax of 8 cents a pack, and the state, which takes $1.11, are each proposing to increase their tax to $1.50 a pack, the highest levy in the country. A pack of cigarettes in the city now costs about $5, including taxes. 
In the city, the proposed cigarette tax increase would take care of a large chunk of the $800 million in new money or taxing authority that Mr. Bloomberg says he needs from the state and federal governments to help close his budget gap. But state senators and some in the Pataki administration are already expressing concern that the cigarette market may be unable to sustain a sharp tax increase on both the state and local levels, an official in the Republican-led Senate said.
Spokesmen for the governor and both houses of the State Legislature said they had not yet analyzed the effects a city tax increase would have on the state. 
Gov. George E. Pataki's budget, written before the city's, projects that the state's tax increase on cigarettes would raise an extra $250 million that Mr. Pataki says is needed to pay for an expansion of health care. The projected drop in sales in the city, which currently accounts for 40 percent of cigarette sales statewide, could wipe out much of that increase.
Mr. McMahon and tobacco company spokesmen say that city smokers have many ways to avoid paying the taxes without smoking less.
"If you can go to New Jersey or to Connecticut or to an Indian reservation or to the Internet and buy it for three and a half bucks a pack less, which is $35 a carton, you have to think that people are going to consider that," said Tommy Payne, vice president for external relations at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
Mr. Barowitz, the mayor's spokesman, was unable to say how much of the projected drop in sales would be attributable to an actual drop in consumption. A "small amount" of that drop would be accounted for by people buying their cigarettes elsewhere, he said.
Mr. McMahon warned that there might be other unforeseen consequences of the tax, like a sharp increase in bootlegging.
Illegal sales might also increase the availability of cigarettes to children, Mr. McMahon said, and the tax would hurt bodegas and other small businesses, where cigarette sales can account for more than a third of sales. 
The Manhattan Institute receives a small amount of its financing, less than 1 percent, from the tobacco industry, Mr. McMahon said, adding that the industry had nothing to do with this study.
Anti-tobacco advocates still favor the tax increase as a way to discourage smoking, saying enforcement against smuggling should be increased.

 BODY:
Fate of Letterman Unclear; News Seen at Risk on ABC
The president of ABC News, David Westin, told his staff that his bosses had not told him that ABC wanted to remove his most prestigious program, "Nightline," to make room for David Letterman.
 The fate of Mr. Letterman's show, which ABC is trying to take from CBS, remained unclear. Still, that ABC would consider removing "Nightline" was taken as an indication in the news division that the network's parent, Walt Disney, would not hesitate to cut news to improve its balance sheet. Page A1. 

Concerns About Industry Advice
Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, has expressed concern about the administration's reliance on campaign contributors when seeking advice. The Energy Department, Mr. Waxman said, consulted 64 corporations and trade groups and only one environmental group when considering rules for the Clean Air Act. The companies, he said, had contributed $6.4 million to Republican candidates since 1999. A11.

Data Sought on Safety Rules
Senate Democrats have asked the Labor Department for information on which officials helped develop proposals to reduce workplace injuries. Democrats have become concerned that the Bush administration has not released a workplace safety plan even though ergonomics rules were repealed a year ago. A11

In Russia, Retaliation by Chicken
Facing the threat of tariffs on steel exports to the United States, Russia is poised to hit an American soft spot: its chicken thighs. The agriculture minister, Aleksei Gordeev, said his office had stopped issuing permits to import American chicken, the United States' single most popular export to Russia. A3.

Unemployment Declines in Japan
Japan's jobless rate fell in January for the first time in a year. But the drop, to 5.3 percent from 5.5 percent in December, did little to dispel concerns that the recession would continue at least through midyear. C2.

Motives in Enron Case Questioned
A lawyer for Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, suggested that Sherron S. Watkins, who has drawn attention for asserting that Mr. Skilling is at fault for Enron's collapse, was motivated by a book deal. Ms. Watkins's lawyer disputed that contention. C3

Signs of an Economic Recovery
A closely watched measure of manufacturing rose for the first time in 18 months in February, a sign that the recession, which began in March, might be ending. In addition, the government reported that consumer spending accelerated in January and that construction activity grew at its fastest pace in a year. But a crucial index of consumer confidence fell in January. C2.

Comcast Makes High-Speed Switch
The Comcast Corporation said that it had completed the move of thousand of clients to its high-speed Internet network and e-mail system -- a months-long process that had been fraught with problems. C2.

At Lehman, a Drop in Compensation
The Lehman Brothers Holdings investment bank may be moving uptown, but the pay of its chief executive has headed south. Richard Fuld Jr., the chief executive, earned $11.6 million last year, about half of the $23 million he took home the year before. C4.

State Farm Reports a Loss
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance said that it lost $5 billion last year as claims rose more than expected. The loss compared with net income of $400 million in 2000. C14.

Volkswagen Recalls 130,000 Cars
Volkswagen said that it was recalling 130,000 cars, many of them in America, after it detected a problem with the brakes. C4.

Hyundai Motor of South Korea retracted a statement that the company planned to seek a cordial relationship with the U.A.W. C2.

HEADLINE: CELEBRATION; 
Chicago

BYLINE:  By Stephen McCauley; Stephen McCauley's most recent novel is "True Enough" (Simon & Schuster).

 BODY:
When Chicago rose from the ashes of its devastating 1871 fire, architects flocked there to help rebuild and, ultimately, gave birth to the skyscraper. Although it's no longer America's second city (in 1984, Los Angeles surpassed it in population), Chicago is still one of the nation's most vibrant urban centers. But what else would you expect from the city that nurtured the invention of the zipper and the Hostess Twinkie?

THE MOOD
 A few hours before my arrival in Chicago, a spell of unseasonably warm and clear December weather was shoved out of town by a front that had come bullying across the Great Plains. The airplane descended slowly through what felt like miles of cloud cover, and the little I could see of the city had been drained of color. The desk clerk at my hotel gave me the weather report: cold drizzle, brisk winds and short, dark afternoons. "I'm afraid there's no improvement in the forecast," she said. 
 Her distress on my behalf was convincing, and her comment sounded so genuinely apologetic, I felt obliged to feign disappointment and bury my delight in the news that the sun was unlikely to shine.
Famous for its corrupt politicians, gangsters and stockyards -- and for Oprah Winfrey -- Chicago is currently in the eye of a storm of economic prosperity and urban revitalization. Buildings are going up everywhere you look. Cranes compete with the John Hancock Center and other soaring landmarks for a place on the skyline, and in many of the neighborhoods that branch off the Loop, the city's business and financial core, the pockmarks of urban blight are being plugged with high-end town houses. 
Mayor Richard M. Daley (that's Daley fils, for those losing track of American political dynasties) has pledged to make the city the greenest in the country, in both the political and the botanical sense. To that end, he has overseen the planting of a quarter of a million trees, bisected major boulevards with median strips spilling over with prairie grasses and colorful blooms and pledged to have the city using renewable sources for 20 percent of its energy needs within five years. A heat-absorbing, oxygen-producing garden has been installed on the roof of city hall.
There's hardly a neighborhood in this sprawling metropolis in which you don't see some sign of continuing beautification, artistic endeavor or community pride (for example, the rainbow-ringed sculptures placed by the city along the section of Halsted Street that runs through the largely gay-inhabited part of town).
And yet, on mild, cloudless days, the city is, to my way of thinking, still too bright, too brawny and, to borrow from Carl Sandburg, too big-shouldered. Sharp sunlight reflecting off all the glass and steel of the whole spectacular skyline can be blinding. In a sunny Chicago, it's easy to feel, like Dreiser's Sister Carrie, "a sense of helplessness amid so much evidence of power and force." If you try to escape by heading to the shore of Lake Michigan (Chicago boasts 29 miles of shoreline), the glistening aquamarine waters and white beaches can induce confusion by tricking you into believing you're closer to the Caribbean than to the American heartland.
In inclement weather, it's a world transformed, and, like a gloomy Venice or a snowy Montreal, one I find agreeable. Clouds lower the Chicago sky, caress and obscure the tops of the dizzyingly high buildings. Fog shrinks the city down to a more human scale. Rain encourages you to go inside the magnificent buildings of Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, Frank Lloyd Wright and other signature American architects for a close-up look at the details of their interiors. There are, to name only a few, the Tiffany mosaics in the Marquette Building, the sleek Art Deco elevators, clocks and walkways in the lobby of the Chicago Board of Trade and the curved oak paneling and British Arts and Crafts fixtures of the Glessner House, a residence designed by H.H. Richardson in the Prairie Avenue district, south of the Loop.
To seek shelter from gusts of icy wind, you might wander into one of the lesser-known museums: the small and inviting Terra Museum of American Art along the Magnificent Mile, an important shopping street; the International Museum of Surgical Science, where you'll learn about trephination and gallstones; the National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum, with its moving collection of war-themed paintings, sculpture and photography by Vietnam veterans.
If you're less lucky than I was, and are dealt a rare string of lovely days, you can always find a shady spot in the French-Renaissance-styled Grant Park or elsewhere in this increasingly verdant city. But here's my advice: pray for rain.

THE FOOD
Chicago is a magnet for conventions. On my most recent visit, the city was host to more than 60,000 radiologists from around the world, a smaller group of plastic surgeons and members of the Plumbing Manufacturers Institute. The Hotel Inter-Continental Chicago, one of two hotels where I stayed, was overrun with name-tagged people speaking in a variety of languages and accents. Whether they were strolling past the tiled fountain in the hotel's Spanish Tea Court (the Inter-Continental was built in the 1920's to house the Shriners' Medinah Athletic Club and is a treasure-trove of eccentric ornamentation), sitting by the romantically lighted pool on the 13th floor where Johnny Weissmuller trained or waiting for the arrival of an elevator, they all seemed to be discussing food. I heard graphic accounts of immense steak dinners featuring Midwestern beef of legendary tenderness, the particulars of Chicago-style barbecue and, for nearly 10 minutes, the heart-stopping wonders of Chicago's infamous multilayered, sausage-packed deep-dish pizza.
Chicago institutions like the Berghoff (a German restaurant) and the Pump Room satisfy the carnivorous needs of even the hungriest conventioneers.
If you prefer lighter fare, or if, like me, you made the mistake of preparing for your trip by rereading the most lurid sections of "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's expose of the Chicago meatpacking industry at the turn of the last century, there are plenty of other options.
Along West Randolph Street, just across the river from the Loop, you'll find a handful of stylish new restaurants tucked between warehouses and loading docks. The most striking is Blackbird. The decor could be more minimalist only if they figured out a way to do without tables and chairs. Here, the culinary offerings feature heirloom everything, local and organic in most cases, and intriguing juxtapositions of sweet and savory, as in a superb appetizer I had of Maine scallops, caramelized celery root and honey-thyme butter. There was plenty of meat on the menu (pork belly, venison, New York strip steak), but also a delicious gateau of sweet potato and cornmeal, flavored with wild mushrooms and caramelized greens.
A little farther afield, in the Wicker Park neighborhood north of downtown, is Mas, a warm, loud restaurant with golden walls and curtains made of beaded glass. Mas plays with "nuevo Latino" cooking, smashing together Brazilian, Cuban and Mexican influences to create some of the tastiest food I ate in Chicago. I had a fantastic seviche of bluefish and scallops marinated in a blend of citrus juices and a taco of grilled tuna, chopped papaya and rosemary and Dijon salsa. Each dish had a distinctive flavor that was exhilarating. Although, to be honest, my enthusiasm might have been unfairly stoked by a sampling of the restaurant's outstanding nuevo Latino cocktails: limey caipirinhas from Brazil and mint-infused Cuban mojitos. To name two I recall. Barely. But fondly.
Long before the neon mayhem of shopping-mall food courts, Marshall Field's department store was a cathedral to consumer goods where you could shop, eat and be merry all day long. 
The interior of the main store on State Street remains impressive, with a Tiffany dome made of 1.6 million pieces of iridescent glass. The grandest of several in-house restaurants is the Walnut Room on the seventh floor.
The day I was there, the Walnut Room was sparsely populated by women with shopping bags and hairdos who sat chatting in hushed tones while a small army of tuxedoed waiters and waitresses padded back and forth across acres of carpeting shouldering silver trays loaded down with covered dishes. As for what was under those covers, the less said, the better. The pleasures of the Walnut Room have little to do with its bland food and everything to do with its dark paneled walls and heavy drapes, and its atmosphere of carefully preserved tradition. You could easily imagine a Dreiser character eating here or, more likely, working in the kitchen.
I left satisfied that I'd had a genuine old-Chicago experience and hungry enough to hunt down one of the city's gut-busting pizzas.

THE STYLE
Across the street from Marshall Field's is the Reliance Building, an architectural landmark that was completed in 1895 by the firm of Burnham & Root. An ancestor of the modern skyscraper, the building has a steel-frame construction that allowed for its then-impressive height, 14 stories, and wall-to-wall windows. It is slim, light and modern in appearance, a marked contrast to many of its burly contemporaries. After decades of neglect, the city refurbished the exterior in the early 1990's, and a hotel company spent tens of millions of dollars restoring the interior. Now, the Reliance is home to the 122-room Hotel Burnham.
When I walked into the lobby and saw the mosaic-tile floor, multicolored marble walls and metal elevator grills, I braced myself. The Burnham is exactly the kind of high-fashion boutique hotel in which you'd expect a staff of hyperhip personnel, trained in the art of subtle condescension.
Not in Chicago. The desk clerk apologized for the weather, offered me a piece of candy and praised a pair of $5 gloves I'd bought at Filene's Basement the day before. This was the first of many encounters I had with outgoing, unaffected Chicago friendliness, a personal style that's distinctly different from the chilly reserve you find on one coast and the invasive chattiness you find on the other. ("We're the anti-California," a friend said of the city she's called home for 25 years.) On the whole, you get the feeling that Chicagoans are too self-possessed and uninterested in pretension -- too authentically cool, you might say -- to worry about being hip.
Like Chicago-style jazz, this open, down-to-earth spirit seems to have migrated north from the Mississippi Delta. Call it Southern manners filtered through urban immediacy, Midwestern pragmatism and immigrant enthusiasm. (Rumor or urban legend has it that at one time there were more Poles living in Chicago than in Warsaw. That might never have been strictly true, but the culture of the city is an amalgam of influences from all over Europe, the United States and, these days, Latin America.)
You run into it everywhere: in the art galleries scattered throughout the River North section of the city; in jazz clubs like the funky Checkerboard Lounge on the South Side or the Green Mill Cocktail Lounge to the north, a crowded, smoky club that's been around for almost 100 years and wears its age proudly.
You see it in the city's hard-working and inventive theater scene. The week I was in town, there were dozens of theatrical offerings, everything from Shakespeare and Sondheim to "H2O." This last was a play at the Neo-Futurarium, a theater above a funeral parlor in the Andersonville neighborhood. For an hour and a half, three actors commented on romantic relationships by alternately drinking water and tossing it at each other, all with a level of commitment and sincerity that banished the faint whiff of ancien avant-garde.
On my last morning in Chicago, the sun finally appeared, timidly at first, and then full force, banishing the fog and clearing out the sky. With only a couple of hours left, I went to the Hancock Center's observatory.
Looking east, you see the lake, shining and imponderably wide, and to the west, the flat expanse of endless sprawl. In between is the heart of the city with its lofty, jagged buildings. Some, like the curved 333 Wacker Drive, are graceful, almost sensuous. Others, like the Sears Tower, are merely assertive. 
But taken together, they create an urban landscape that is hypnotic in its variety and complexity.
These days, standing atop tall buildings isn't quite the giddy thrill it used to be, and I was told that since early September, crowds had been on the thin side. But somehow, in Chicago, it's easy to feel as if you have your feet planted firmly on the ground, even when you're standing on the 94th floor.

 BODY:
 (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)

AMERICA'S FIRST DYNASTY: The Adamses, 1735-1918, by Richard Brookhiser. (Free Press, $25.) A succinct, skillful account of the lives of John, John Quincy, Charles Francis and Henry, four generations of men often brilliant but often shortsighted as well: two presidents, one diplomat and, finally, a historian who felt he had failed the ancestors.

THE FUTURE OF LIFE, by Edward O. Wilson. (Knopf, $22.) This distinguished biologist proposes that there is yet time to avoid a grand planetary environmental crash provided we get serious, acknowledge a duty of stewardship and recognize an emotional affiliation (biophilia, as he calls it) with other kinds of life.

BLOOD-DARK TRACK: A Family History, by Joseph O'Neill. (Granta, $27.95.) A smart, diligent inquiry into the World War II era and the (possibly culpable) activities of the author's grandfathers, one a Turk interned by the British in Palestine, the other an I.R.A. officer, perhaps a murderer.

FINGERSMITH, by Sarah Waters. (Riverhead, $25.95.) A fine Gothic ear is part of Waters's kit in this neo-Dickensian tale of a baby farmer and a foundling who is drawn into a fearful sexual intimacy as part of a scheme to defraud an heiress.

GRACEFULLY INSANE: The Rise and Fall of America's Premier Mental Hospital, by Alex Beam. (PublicAffairs, $26.) In its putatively mind-healthy bucolic setting, McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., sheltered the well-born and the articulate bewildered for a couple of centuries; this entertaining narrative is short on the real desolation of mental illness but copious as to anecdote and changing clinical fashions.

ENEMY WOMEN, by Paulette Jiles. (Morrow, $24.95.) Love crosses the lines in this Civil War novel set in dubious Missouri, where an 18-year-old spitfire of rebel attachments is the prisoner of a Union officer whose interrogation of her turns into a prison romance.

SALT: A World History, by Mark Kurlansky. (Walker, $28.) There's more to salt than everybody knows; without it, people can't live. It's cheap now, and many people get too much, but that wasn't always so; Kurlansky gives the economic, political, chemical and industrial story of a substance once so valuable that "salary" is named for it.

HOUSE OF WOMEN, by Lynn Freed. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) Fairy-tale elements prevail in this novel in which a mother and a daughter fight to the death; Nalia, an opera singer and Holocaust survivor, reigns over Thea, who is quasi-abducted by a Bluebeardish Syrian in a narrative full of dream logic, psychoanalysis and the writing of journals for others to read.

A LIFE IN PIECES: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski, by Blake Eskin. (Norton, $25.95.) In 1997, Wilkomirski's "Fragments" was much admired as a masterpiece of Holocaust writing; since then, both author and book have faded into fraudulence. Eskin's research now illuminates not the Holocaust but the fantasy life of a disturbed young man with an unhappy childhood whose real name Eskin himself is not altogether sure of.

HEADLINE: John Kamm's Third Way 

BYLINE:  By Tina Rosenberg; Tina Rosenberg wrote last year about solving the world's AIDS crisis.

 BODY:
A dozen years ago, almost no one seemed less likely to become a crusader for human rights than John Kamm. He was the president of Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce and a regional vice president of Occidental Chemical Corporation, a multinational company that, in addition to paying Kamm very handsomely, provided him with a luxury apartment, a Mercedes and driver, two maids, a cost-of-living allowance, private-school tuition for his sons and paid home leave. He had few reasons to rock the boat.
 In May 1990, Kamm was preparing to go to Washington to testify before Congress that China's human rights record should not get in the way of granting the country Most Favored Nation trading status. This, of course, was the position of both the Chinese government and the Americans doing business in China, who desperately sought the lower tariffs that M.F.N. would provide. But since the Tiananmen Square massacre the previous year, the debate in the United States over China's trade status had grown acrimonious. The democracy protests in Tiananmen and the subsequent massacre -- hundreds killed, more than 10,000 detained or arrested in the immediate aftermath -- had turned human rights in China into a topic of discussion in living rooms across America. Many members of Congress were now groping for ways to force China to respect human rights, and M.F.N. was one of the few tools available. 
 A week before Kamm's trip to Washington, Zhou Nan, Beijing's senior representative in Hong Kong, held a banquet in that city to thank the American business community for its support on M.F.N. Zhou toasted Kamm, thanking him profusely, then turned to face him. As Kamm explains it today, an idea popped into his head as he was sitting there. He had read on the front page of that day's South China Morning Post about a young Hong Kong student who had been detained in Shanghai shortly after the massacre and was being tortured in prison. Kamm knew that Congress would inevitably raise Tiananmen as the main reason the country should get no favors from Washington, and he also knew that gestures by China would help ease tensions. So in the midst of his toast, Kamm said to Zhou, "Why don't you release Yao Yongzhan?"
Zhou became immediately hostile. In front of the assembled crowd, he accused Kamm of committing an unfriendly act of gross interference in China's affairs. When Kamm left the room to use the bathroom, his fellow American businessmen apologized to Zhou.
Roughly a month later, though, Yao Yongzhan walked out of prison. 
In his youth in New Jersey, Kamm was interested in civil rights and was a passionate admirer of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. "But when I had to go make money, a lot of this slipped away," he says. Not all of it. As vice president of the Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong when the Tiananmen Square massacre took place, Kamm narrowly managed to get a resolution through the chamber condemning the massacre, over the opposition of its bigger members.
At the end of 1990, Kamm's one-year term as president of the Chamber of Commerce ended. Six months later, his successor wrote him on chamber stationery asking him to ensure that the press did not link AmCham, as the chamber is called, to his comments on human rights. Certain companies with significant business interests in China, the letter said, were worried that AmCham might be seen as a partner in activities "which not only exceed our charter but which, it is felt, could trigger unfortunate reactions." A month after that, the chamber passed a resolution that it should not be "overtly linked/associated with" noncommercial issues.
By that point, however, Kamm had become a man on a mission. In March 1991, he traveled to Guangzhou, the capital of China's most open province, Guangdong, and later to Beijing, carrying lists with the names of several prisoners that he had compiled from human rights groups. He called ministry officials and asked for meetings, in which he presented his lists and asked for information on the prisoners. Over the next two years, all of those on his lists were released. 
Among the first to be freed, in July 1991, were the brothers Li Lin and Li Zhi, two labor advocates from Hunan. "I had not been convinced that Yao's release was anything more than a fluke," Kamm says. "But from the moment I intervened on behalf of the Lis, I could sense the government was receptive." A week after the brothers' release, Kamm and his wife had dinner with them in Hong Kong. "There were still torture marks on them," Kamm says. "They told me the day I got involved was the day their situation improved. I wept. That's when I started to think that I could talk to the Chinese about freeing prisoners, and they would do it." 
In September 1991, Kamm resigned from Occidental and began his own business so that he could devote more time to working on prisoner releases. Today he is almost entirely out of the business world. He lives in San Francisco, where he moved with his Hong Kong-born wife and two sons in 1995 and where he runs the foundation Dui Hua, or "dialogue," on a budget of $300,000 a year. Dui Hua's financing comes mainly from the conservative Smith Richardson Foundation and the International Republican Institute, whose president was Lorne W. Craner, now the Bush administration's assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor.
Kamm travels to Hong Kong and China four times a year, gathering information on obscure political prisoners and presenting their names to government officials. He estimates that his involvement has been at least partly responsible for about 250 prisoners being released or being given better treatment in prison. No other person or organization in the world, including the State Department, has helped more Chinese prisoners. 
America has a bipartisan policy toward democracy and human rights in China, and it is called trade. "Trade freely with China and time is on our side," President Bush says, echoing President Clinton's promise to build "peace through trade, investment and commerce." The accepted wisdom is that trade is not only good for human rights in China, but it is also enough -- that the exposure to American practices and the growth of a middle class that come from trade will eventually force China to democratize, or at least to become a less repressive dictatorship. 
But American businesses are not quite the ambassadors of values we might want. Far from raising standards in China, many companies with Chinese factories producing goods for American consumers are engaged in a race to the bottom. 
Hong Kong- and New York-based labor investigators have found factories producing brand-name toys, clothing and shoes for the American market where the average wage was 14 to 19 cents an hour and where, during peak production seasons, workers had to be on the job for 15 hours a day, seven days a week. In some factories, workers pay a deposit when they start their jobs or are not given their first month's pay, to keep them from leaving. Some must pay the factory so much for their meals and dorm beds that they end up owing their employers money. These practices are violations of Chinese law. And the rule of law is at the heart of human rights.
One reason for the disparity in what American corporations say and do is that they do not own their factories but subcontract with others to make products. In general, contractors win jobs by promising low prices, which promotes worker abuse. More important, the system provides a layer of insulation that allows American manufacturers to avoid responsibility for products that bear their brand name. 
Just as pernicious is the behavior of American companies on matters outside their immediate purview. When China drafts new commercial laws, American businesses take a lively and vocal interest. When China jails bishops and censors the Internet, American executives say nothing -- or they echo the Communist Party line. 
The Internet will be the test for business in the future. China makes it illegal to post or download subversive messages and asks Internet service providers and Internet cafes to police users. As of last year, sending material considered secret or reactionary is a capital crime, although so far people convicted of Internet-related crimes have received sentences of only two to four years. Human Rights Watch tried to get software companies to intervene after one Sichuan Web master, Huang Qi, was imprisoned in 2000 for posting human rights material. Human Rights Watch argued to companies that since they were promoting the Internet as a tool to change China, they could not keep silent when a Chinese citizen was jailed for doing exactly that. "We failed miserably to get any company to say a word, privately or publicly," says Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch in Asia.
It's hard to dispute, on the one hand, that China's opening to the world in order to attract foreign investment has been positive for freedom. But the endorsement China's leadership receives from American executives is so damaging to the cause of human rights today that it undercuts the beneficial effects of engagement. "Businesses act the way they think China wants them to," Kamm says. Last year, for example, Li Shaomin, an American citizen and seven-year employee of AT&T in New Jersey, was arrested by the Chinese government on spying charges as part of a campaign to intimidate ethnic Chinese academics abroad. AT&T declined to let Li's former boss, Salvatore Cordo, even collect employee signatures for a petition for his release. Cordo says that he was surprised and perplexed. "I wasn't asking for a public statement -- I wasn't naive," he says. "But there was an absolute terror on the company's part to do a damn thing that could be even remotely interpreted as helpful." (In an e-mail message to Cordo, the company said, "We appreciate your commitment to this cause, but we believe it is not appropriate for AT&T to take an active role in publicizing it" and that the matter should "be handled on a government-to-government basis.")
Kamm's own experience has convinced him that businesses can speak out for human rights and, if they do it right, not put their profits at risk. In December, he met with the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing to try to persuade it to press the Chinese government on human rights. "I never had a single situation where the Chinese said to me or a salesman of mine, 'Cut it out or your business will suffer,"' he told the chamber. "There is nothing but upside in intervening."
Kamm's argument is both moral and practical: business executives should intervene because they are the ones who can get results. Executives can make the same plea that Amnesty International would make, but the Chinese hear it as coming not from a hated adversary but from friends with a common agenda. "Kamm is very critical of our policies, but his approach is acceptable to us," Li Baodong, China's top human rights diplomat, told me in a meeting this winter. "He loves China. He shows respect. He is constructive and realistic." 
I went to Beijing in December to watch Kamm work. One freezing morning, Kamm sat in an armchair in a first-floor reception room at the Supreme People's Court in Beijing across a small table from Liu Hehua, the director of the court's foreign affairs bureau. Kamm pulled a letter from his briefcase. "My good friend Senator Hatch asked me to share this with you," he said. "He told me he wanted to re-establish contact with his good friend President Xiao Yang," who is the supreme court president. "He said, 'I haven't written in a long time, would you deliver a letter for me?"' 
Liu looked skeptical, as well he should. "What's the main idea?" he asked. 
"It's to congratulate China on joining the World Trade Organization," Kamm said. "You know, we are very close friends. In fact, the senator calls me 'cousin.' His mother's family name is Kamm." He reminded Liu that Orrin Hatch is the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. "He says he hopes the supreme court can help me find information on cases." 
While Kamm and his staff can find information about arrests in official Chinese publications, the journals often do not report on the subsequent trials and sentences. So Kamm needed someone at the supreme court who could find out for him what happened to arrested prisoners. On his last visit to the court, three months earlier, Kamm asked for information on the case of Yu Rong, who was arrested in 1989 in Shanghai for printing and distributing 1,490 "reactionary" leaflets. The Shanghai police called the case the most important political case of its kind in the city's history and organized an extraordinary manhunt at a time when violent crime was soaring. But the supreme court official who had made inquiries for Kamm had been unable to find out the verdict or sentence. She might have called the wrong court. But it could also be that the information had simply disappeared -- or, perhaps, the prisoner had.
Now, sitting in the supreme court's reception room, Kamm said: "As an American, I find this hard to understand. How is it no one can find the result?" Kamm and Liu discussed the sentence Yu Rong might have received, and then Kamm, rather than pressing the matter, introduced into the conversation an offer of assistance. "If you want me to find information on cases in the United States, I will help you," he said, indulging the Chinese tendency to counter American criticism of human rights violations with accusations of their own. Then, using a variant on a mantra repeated by every Chinese official I met, Kamm concluded, "My foundation believes in dialogue based on equality and mutual respect, grounded in accurate information." 
It is safe to say that Kamm's meetings with Chinese officials bear no resemblance to those of most human rights advocates. He strokes. He drops names of Washington contacts cultivated largely for the purpose of dropping their names. Later in their meeting, Kamm offered Liu help in finding American senior judges and trade experts who might provide advice on solving international trade disputes. Kamm speaks not only Mandarin and Cantonese but also the language of the party, which is just as important. 
Though he no longer spends much time in the business world, Kamm still considers himself a salesman. "I manufacture and sell prisoner lists," he says. "I know a sale is made when I hear about a release."
Although Kamm's lists include some high-profile prisoners, he concentrates on those unknown outside China. Dui Hua employs researchers in Hong Kong, San Francisco and Paris who comb regional Chinese newspapers and police gazettes looking for reports on arrests or trials for political crimes. Kamm says that he has uncovered the names of more than 2,000 prisoners, 80 percent of them unknown in the West, and has presented about 450 of the names to Chinese authorities. 
Although in many cases prisoners are released soon after Kamm brings up their cases, he rarely receives proof that it was his work that resulted in their freedom. He often doesn't even find out about releases until months afterward, when the family or the government -- whose information has been reliable -- lets him or someone else know of the outcome. "They often are really at pains not to give the impression it had anything to do with me," he says. "They can sit there with a perfectly straight face and say to me, 'This prisoner was released because his behavior has been very good."' 
It is not clear how many people China detains for political acts. In 2000, nearly 700 people were arrested for "endangering state security" (what used to be called counterrevolutionary offenses). This does not include people arrested for "using a cult to sabotage implementation of the law," a category of detainees that is soaring because of the government's hysteria over the spiritual group Falun Gong. It also does not include those taken for political reasons but convicted of other things, like fraud. Nor does it take into account the large number (officially estimated at 230,000, though possibly much higher) who have been sentenced without trial to work in "re-education through labor" camps, many of whom are labor advocates or individuals who practice religion outside government-approved churches. Catholics, moreover, are often picked up and kept for long stretches of time -- sometimes years -- without being convicted of a specific crime. Su Zhimin, a Catholic bishop, has been held informally since October 1997. 
China has used these laws not just to limit dissent but also to eliminate it. About 40 members of the China Democracy Party, a toothless group of a few hundred members writing essays mainly for one another, are known to be serving prison terms, some for more than 10 years. A labor advocate who distributed leaflets encouraging workers to form free unions got 15 years. Five leaders of an evangelical Christian group were sentenced to death in 1999. Tibetan and Uighur dissidents often get particularly long sentences. While many Chinese prisoners do not serve their full sentences, early release usually goes to those who confess their crimes and express remorse. Since very few dissidents believe they have committed crimes, they usually do not benefit from sentence reductions. 
The Chinese officials I spoke with uniformly argued that not a single person in the prison system is being held for a political act -- they are all there for breaking the law. This is technically correct, of course, as lawbreaking is whatever the party says it is. What the Chinese call "rule of law" has nothing to do with the equal application of laws drafted by the public's legitimate representatives. The officials I met also maintained that if they did not arrest and imprison people for violating such vague laws as endangering state security, or if they let prisoners out before they finished their sentences, they would then themselves be violating the rule of law.
In this context, John Kamm's success has been surreal. Why would a totalitarian government let political prisoners out of jail simply because an American private citizen inquires about them? 
One reason is that the Chinese respond to Kamm's detailed knowledge about prisoners -- he often knows more about a case than the Chinese officials he is seeing. The other reason is that Kamm, through tactical obsequiousness, has come to seem like a friend. Zhang Yijun, who was the first Chinese official Kamm ever contacted about prisoners, said that when Kamm first called him, he said his goal was to make China's progress better known in the West. Every Chinese official I spoke to described Kamm's motives this way: he was not focused on getting prisoners released; he was promoting United States-China understanding. They know perfectly well what Kamm wants, but working through him allows them to win international points without buckling to human rights groups or Washington human rights officials, whom they perceive as unremittingly hostile. "Sometimes it's useful to strike a bargain with the United States government, but never do it under pressure," Zhang says. "If it is done with foreign intervention, it's counterproductive -- people here can have a radical reaction. I'd rather release prisoners as a gift for a friend who comes to talk to me." 
There are officials inside China's bureaucracy who argue that the country would be more stable if it permitted peaceful dissent and allowed some independent civil society. But this is a very controversial position. Technically, information about people convicted of state security offenses is a state secret, and officials who reveal it without authorization are subject to prosecution. This is unlikely, but the Cultural Revolution was not so long ago that bureaucrats aren't first and foremost watching their own backs. "If the government releases people who are violating the law, people can send a letter of complaint to the People's Congress," says Li Baodong, the human rights diplomat. "You'd be in trouble. Nobody's looking for trouble."
Until his December trip, officials would normally pass information to Kamm by saying, "My secretary will now give you something." And then the official would leave the room while a piece of paper changed hands. Kamm took it as a sign of great progress that on this trip one official handed him a document directly. 
Kamm's 25-plus years of dealing with the Chinese government have helped him understand how to use the servility and fear inside China's bureaucracy to persuade officials to intervene on behalf of prisoners without even realizing it. His request for information often results in a Beijing big shot's placing a phone call to a provincial justice official or a warden to ask for the facts, which is immediately taken as a sign that this prisoner has influential friends -- the key to all doors in China. 
For example, last year Kamm provided the names of 50 prisoners to the State Department, which included them in a list it submitted to the Chinese before Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit in July. In October, Lorne Craner gave Kamm a detailed report based on the Chinese response. It was more information than they had ever released before. That night, at dinner in Washington, Kamm was exultant. "They freed the Locust Man!" he exclaimed, referring to an imprisoned robber who, after the Tiananmen Square massacre, distributed slogans criticizing the government on slips of paper that he tied to the legs of locusts. "They freed this old Kazakh poet, Kajikhumar Shabdan! And Wei Shouzhong and Guo Yunqiao, two labor leaders!" 
For Kamm, however, the list was only a starting point. He advised Craner to go over the information provided by the Chinese and see if anyone else was eligible for parole under Chinese law. He also suggested going back to the central government and asking very specific questions about any discrepancies, even those that might seem absolutely inconsequential to outsiders. "It makes the central government go back to Hunan again," Kamm explains. "And then the locals say: 'What's this? Why this interest in Peng Shi?"' 
Kamm's methods have influenced the State Department. "We've learned from his work," an American Embassy official in Beijing says. "Be patient, do your homework, follow through." But Kamm also goes to Washington to amass a thick file of letters from officials that he then uses to convince the Chinese that making John Kamm happy is a way to make Washington happy. And it works. "We look at these cases as connected to our bilateral relations," Li Baodong told me bluntly. 
Kamm's relationship with Washington helped smooth out the last details for a major prisoner release earlier this year. Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan ethnomusicologist, was 6 years into an 18-year sentence for espionage. Choephel had been arrested while in Tibet taping traditional music and dance. Because he had been a Fulbright scholar who taught at Middlebury College, many in the United States, particularly Vermont's Congressional delegation, had pressed the Chinese on his case. In October 1999, Senator James Jeffords received a letter from China's ambassador to Washington, Li Zhaoxing, stating that Choephel had been in poor health. "We sent it to various people who know China," said Laurie Schultz Heim, a legislative assistant to Jeffords. "It didn't mean anything to anyone. Only Kamm looked at it and said: 'This is the road map. This is how we get him out.' He was better than anyone at reading the tea leaves and coming up with a plan." 
During a meeting in Beijing in December, Li Baodong suggested to Kamm that China was getting ready for an important release, and he hinted that the prisoner in question was Choephel. He also said that there was resistance in the bureaucracy. Kamm decided to push him to give formal approval immediately, though he had to speak in the cryptic way the bureaucracy demands. "I'll come back to see you tomorrow," Kamm said. "Then you indicate to me if I can come back the day after tomorrow to discuss this." 
The next day, Kamm was nervous as we sat in the reception room of the enormous foreign ministry. Then, with a great flourish, in walked Li Zhaoxing -- now the vice foreign minister and probably China's next foreign minister -- who had written the letter about Choephel. He stayed only a minute and exchanged pleasantries, but Kamm had received the signal he was hoping for. Li Zhaoxing's welcoming presence, if only for a moment, meant that Kamm's concerns had been heard and that the release had been approved.
The next day, Kamm and Li Baodong hammered out the details: Washington would pay for the flight to the United States, the announcement would state that Choephel was getting medical parole, no one could keep Choephel from telling the press whatever he wanted. On Jan. 20, Choephel took a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit, a free man. 
Much about China's "dialogue" with Kamm, some human rights advocates point out, is really more like a hostage negotiation. Kamm is being used, they say, but he readily acknowledges this. "What matters is what you are used for," he says. "Should we not be trying to get people out of prison?" 
Robin Munro, a London-based China researcher who has served as director of Human Rights Watch's Hong Kong office, says that wariness about Kamm goes back to his invoking human rights in the service of extending Most Favored Nation status. "In his first few years, there was a lot of suspicion among rights groups," he says. "He had twin tracks: lobbying and human rights work. But he went native on the human rights work, probably as a result of personal emotional experiences meeting former political prisoners." 
More seriously, critics have said that Kamm's interventions do little to change the system or prevent arrests in the first place. Some call what he does humanitarian work, not human rights work. "It's important to help particular individuals to any degree you can," says Xiao Qiang, executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China. "But human rights work in China should promote the legitimacy of human rights among the government and Chinese society. If someone is released but still cannot say the things that got him imprisoned to begin with, it's not much of an improvement. The Chinese government is manipulating this process. Not only do they not pay for their human rights violations; they have discovered they can trade information on political prisoners for a better image and access to the U.S. government. Their ability to arrest dissidents is strengthened, not weakened." 
Munro echoes this sentiment, though he also says that the cause benefits from various approaches. "The job of human rights groups is to make the Chinese government hurt internationally for its abuses," he says. "Kamm's job is to come in and say to the Chinese, 'Friends, here's how it can stop hurting."' 
Kamm's reception among human rights advocates is a warm one, however, compared with the ostracism offered him by the business community. In December, he met with members of the American Chamber of Commerce in China to ask for its support and ask it to work as a group to help political prisoners. 
The reception echoed two previous AmCham China meetings. In 1983, George Shultz, then secretary of state, had lunch with American business executives, who repeatedly asked why Washington wasn't doing more to help them in China and complained that Japanese and German companies had an easier time getting licenses to export to China. To which Shultz replied, "Why don't you move to Japan or Western Europe?" 
Eleven years later, Clinton's secretary of state, Warren Christopher, came to the same group and heard a similar message. Businessmen complained bitterly about a Clinton executive order conditioning M.F.N. renewal on human rights progress. Christopher stood there and took the criticism meekly, and Clinton later retreated on M.F.N., severing the connection between trade preferences and human rights. 
Timothy P. Stratford, the General Motors executive who was chairman of AmCham in 2000 and 2001, opened the meeting with Kamm by referring to the Shultz visit in 1983. "I would say that AmCham is very different today," he said. 
I didn't see it. Kamm began his presentation with a recitation of his business credentials and his work for prisoners. Then he asked for AmCham's help. Kamm's relationship with AmCham was not great, but I was surprised by the bluntness of their rejection. "The majority of American corporations all around the world are not with you on the issue of working on specific cases," said Christian Murck, AmCham's incoming chairman.
"I've figured that out," Kamm replied. 
The executives argued that they did maintain high standards in their own factories and that they publicly expressed American values. Stratford gave two examples of speaking out. He was one of two speakers at a conference last April, during the time when the crew of the downed American naval surveillance plane was being held by the Chinese government. Although G.M. was competing for a contract, Stratford said, "I raised the incident and made it clear the problem had to be solved."
Next he cited AmCham's activism when the National People's Congress was considering a new contract law, for which members of AmCham's legal committee volunteered their time to help write new draft legislation. 
When Kamm asked for examples of intervention that did not include Americans or the self-interest of the chamber's members, Stratford said, "If we speak out on broader issues, we lose credibility." 
Jim Gradoville, vice president of the Asia Pacific division of Motorola, China's largest foreign investor, seconded this notion. "A company doesn't know what the facts are," he said. "We concentrate on business."
The next day, I went to see Clark T. Randt Jr., a lawyer who had been first vice president of Hong Kong AmCham when Kamm was president. Today, Randt, a fraternity brother of George W. Bush's at Yale, is the American ambassador in Beijing. Randt said that the chamber could speak out on human rights even if individual members felt they could not. "Business in China is based on relationships," he said. "To slap someone around on the shortcomings of the government may not be conducive to good commercial relations. But that's why this is a perfect role for the chamber. If the chamber takes a collective position, you can separate it from company A, B or C."
When I asked Randt if he felt that businessmen could have an influence on nonbusiness subjects, he said: "I think they could. When the U.S. government speaks, we are viewed as having our own national interests. If the Chinese heard from just 'the people' that something is out of step with international standards, really unacceptable, it would help make the point." I told him that the chamber members had said that it would be hard to get the consensus necessary to take a position and that they seemed disinclined to speak out. He was silent. "It would be shameful if that were the case," he eventually said. "The chamber should understandably have a commercial focus, but it's the perfect organization to do these things. We're Americans. The Chinese are not going to haul them all off to jail for having meetings like these poor fellows in house churches." 
The truth is, of course, that if companies wanted to become competent to make judgments and speak out on human rights, they could do so rather quickly. Or they could write John Kamm a check. But they don't. 
A year ago, Kamm sent a letter asking for money to 100 companies that are members of both AmCham Hong Kong and the United States-China Business Council. "Not a single company offered any kind of support -- moral or financial," he says, adding, "I did get a couple of $100 checks from employees." Kamm says that a major energy company was thinking of making a donation and first asked the Chinese Embassy in Washington if China would have a problem. "No problem," the answer came back a week later. But the company's Beijing headquarters shot it down. He has received a few corporate donations, from Reebok's Human Rights Foundation (which is separate from the corporation) and from Nike, as well as from a carpet-importing company whose owners are personal friends. 
Even if corporations decide that they would be better off if China were more like Sweden, they can reap the benefits while risking nothing if they leave the heavy lifting to others. And rule of law is not to everyone's taste. A Korean entrepreneur told me that he was thrilled with the business climate in China. "If you know the right guy, you can do anything," he marveled. It is good to be a foreign businessman in China. Businessmen live in a warm cocoon, protected from rubbing up against the problems of ordinary Chinese. It would probably be hard to find five businessmen in China who want to see labor advocates released from prison. In fact, the annual white paper that AmCham prepares advocates reductions in labor costs and more, not fewer, restrictions on labor rights. 
There is, however, one particularly compelling reason for businesses to work for human rights: the government has picked up dozens of ethnic Chinese executives for foreign companies. In 1996, Xiu Yichun, a senior executive at Shell, was arrested on charges of obtaining state secrets. At the time, Shell was negotiating to build an oil refinery, and the "state secrets" probably related to the financing and environmental impact of the project. Xiu spent a year largely incommunicado before she was released. 
Chinese officials argue that never in history has their nation been freer and more prosperous, and they are certainly right. The transformation since Mao's death is astonishing. From 1978 to 1996, China grew at the rate of 10 percent a year -- and only slightly slower after that -- growth that has helped lift 200 million people out of poverty.
Politically, the changes have been less striking, but nevertheless significant. Before Deng Xiaoping's reforms, the party told Chinese citizens where to live and work. There was little opportunity for travel or study abroad. There was no modern legal system at all, no check on arbitrary Communist Party power. 
It is not clear if China's short-term future is one of further liberalization or more controls. For every Taiwan and South Korea, where trade and economic growth led to democratization, there are examples where it didn't -- Japan and Germany early in the last century, Singapore today. When trade has helped, it has done so by creating a middle class that eventually rebelled against state controls. China has a booming middle class, but one that is unlikely to revolt. Because business is so intertwined with the state, the private sector is dependent on government officials, or it is actually made up of government officials and their cronies. 
Rebellion, in addition, cannot happen in a vacuum. "Taiwan had decades of civil movements," says Xiao Qiang of Human Rights in China. "China never allowed any organized dissent. For openness to automatically lead to democracy, you need people, civil organizations, grass-roots forces to do it. In China, the government has cracked down so hard that it's impossible." And the government is now more repressive of speech than it was during the mid-1980's, stifling dissent precisely to make sure that in a time of great economic upheaval discontent does not lead to political change. 
International business has contributed to China's modernization. China's desire for trade has encouraged the leadership to allow thousands of young people to study abroad, in itself an important liberalizing influence. It has promoted legal reform, although more in the commercial area than elsewhere. 
But business has also exerted a backward pull. The allure of money in China has discouraged world criticism that could have been a force for more democracy. China is quite open about rewarding foreign countries for shutting up. In 1997, a month after France helped to stop a resolution censuring China at a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, China awarded Airbus Industrie a $1.5 billion contract to sell planes to China, making it quite clear that it was because of France's action at the United Nations. 
Whether China rewards and punishes businesses in a similar fashion, business executives certainly operate as if it does. As a result, American executives in China today are not exporting American values. Rather, they have absorbed those of the Chinese Communist Party, praising repressive leaders and endorsing, through silence or worse, their methods. 
Trade can better help to reform China if American executives reform first. Corporate executives in China could start with their own factories, enforcing the law, paying benefits like health insurance and workers' compensation, protecting employees against government abuse and, as Reebok has done in one factory, encouraging workers to elect their union representatives rather than accept those of the party. Outside their factory gates, American executives could use the skills they have employed to improve China's commercial codes to lobby for the rule of law and human rights. Even if they were unsuccessful, they would at least be demonstrating to Chinese officials that even friends find certain practices repugnant. 
And Kamm says that corporations should not just speak the rhetoric of human rights or even settle for promoting democratic practices by example; they should be engaged in the practical work of prisoner releases. Because American businesses are scattered over parts of China where diplomats do not set foot, Kamm would like to see them contribute by collecting public information on prisoners' trials and by working for their release. "I want them to realize that the things I do, drawing up and presenting lists, is not threatening, and in fact they can make a big difference in the lives of the Chinese people," he says. "I was a vice president of a corporation that had 50 vice presidents. I was no big deal. Think for a minute of what the chairman of the board or vice chairman or president could do."
He goes on now, more impassioned. "The human rights community built a movement," he says. "If the head of China for Amnesty quits and opens a bakery, there are others to fill his or her shoes. What do I have? Relationships with N.G.O.'s and this bizarre relationship with the Chinese government." 
But that bizarre relationship is one that he insists can, should, be exploited by others, and the resistance of those others to follow even for a moment in his footsteps is baffling and infuriating to him. He recently wrote a letter to a businessman friend asking why he could get nowhere with corporations. "I'm one of you," he said. "I was one of the first to defend the trade relationship. So how can I reach the business community? Why this spectacular failure?"

 CORRECTION:
An article on Page 58 of The Times Magazine today about John Kamm, an American businessman who helps negotiate the release of political prisoners in China, refers imprecisely to the title of Jim Gradoville, who commented on the involvement of American businesses in human rights issues in China. He is regional vice president of Motorola for Asia-Pacific government relations, not vice president of Motorola Asia Pacific.

HEADLINE: They're Strapping On The Backpacks 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN; SUSAN STELLIN writes frequently for The Times.

 BODY:
AT a time when checking in for a flight and getting through airport security can be an adventure itself -- after all, you have to pack carefully, wear comfortable shoes and prepare for the unexpected -- it takes a certain kind of traveler to seek out the added adrenaline rush of river rafting, rock climbing, or sea kayaking once the plane lands.
 But apparently, travelers looking for more traditional excitement have not exactly stashed away their backpacks to stay home and flip between the Outdoor Life Network and CNN. 
 Although there are few statistics to quantify this assessment, interviews with adventure travel suppliers suggest that while business has been hurt by the downturn in travel, the adventure market has been more resilient than many expected after Sept. 11. And since January, outfitters report increases in inquiries and bookings that may signal a return to typical travel levels.
That is a welcome change from the dire mood many companies reported last fall, said Grant Davis, an editor at Outside magazine who surveyed 36 adventure travel outfitters in the weeks after Sept. 11. 
"At first, many thought they'd go out of business by the end of the year," Mr. Davis said. "A couple days later they thought they'd survive, and then a week later they were saying, 'Well, it's just going to be a tight year.' " In a follow-up survey a couple of months later, he said, "the gist was, it's business as usual."
That perspective was confirmed by a separate survey conducted early last month by Outside and a travel Web site, away.com. Of the 2,600 who described themselves as "active travelers" and responded, 85 percent said they would travel as much or more in 2002 than they did last year.
Of 62 adventure outfitters also surveyed, almost two-thirds reported that inquiries and bookings for early 2002 suggested an increase in sales over the same period last year.
Still, adventure travelers have certainly made some changes in their plans. They are showing more interest in North America, as well as parts of Latin America and the Pacific, outfitters say. Last-minute bookings -- rather than trips scheduled months in advance -- are more common, and many outfitters said they had noticed an increase in family trips.
Business from repeat clients has held up better than bookings from new ones, who may be more inclined to stay home because of international uncertainty. But outfitters say those who are not traveling are generally more concerned about the state of their bank accounts than terrorism or waiting in line at airports.
For someone planning a jungle trip in the Amazon, say, "the least of your problems is getting on a plane and flying into Manaus," said Paul Muir, the organizer of a recent trade show on adventure travel.
Part of the challenge in assessing the state of the industry is defining what adventure travel is. To a 36-year-old rock climber, an adventure might require a steep incline, 40 pounds of gear and an amazing view at the end. For a couple in their 50's with two children, trekking along the Inca Trail in Machu Picchu -- with local guides carrying the heavy backpacks -- may qualify. 
"The better definition for us is experiential -- people who wish to have an experience when they are on vacation," said Mr. Muir, who produced the Iatos 2002 Expo and World Congress on Adventure and Eco Tourism the week before last in Chicago. "That experience can be the challenge of climbing Mount Everest, or going on a tour of cultural or historical sites in Peru or Thailand."
That broad definition of the adventure traveler, combined with the fragmented nature of the industry, make it nearly impossible to gauge how much is spent on adventure travel each year -- and therefore how the industry is faring.
"It's honestly very, very difficult to come up with," Mr. Muir acknowledged, declining to even offer an estimate of adventure travel spending. 
But there is at least some consensus among outfitters about how their business has been affected. About half a dozen companies that organize trips -- ranging from a private luxury safari in Africa to a family river rafting vacation -- estimate bookings were down 20 to 25 percent from September through December, compared with the previous year, and that business has picked up significantly since January.
Robyn Gorman, marketing director for Mountain Travel Sobek (www.mtsobek .com) in El Cerrito, Calif., which organizes small group hiking, rafting and other adventure trips, said that after a 20 percent drop off in bookings between September and December, business has rebounded.
"The first week of January was the first time since Sept. 11 that our bookings had surpassed the prior year," Ms. Gorman said, noting another positive sign reported by the sales team: customers were mispronouncing destinations like the Galapagos when they called to make reservations. "That's when we know it's not just our current clients booking anymore," she said.
Sobek still has trips scheduled for this summer to Iran and Jordan. It did cancel some trips the week of Sept. 11 because of grounded airlines -- as well as a marketing e-mail message that was to have been sent on Sept. 11 saying, "The Middle East is hot again."
Other companies have been quicker to cancel trips to areas customers might consider unstable. Backroads (call up www .backroads.com), which is based in Berkeley, Calif., and combines bicycling and hiking tours with high-end accommodations, has temporarily discontinued some trips to Turkey and Morocco as well as other parts of Indonesia, said Tom Hale, the company's founder and president. "As much as we love those trips and want to go back to those areas, we just didn't feel the demand was there," he said.
Backroads also reports that business has been improving lately, particularly for North American destinations, and that bookings made in the last two weeks of December were higher than in any comparable period in the company's history. "People are all of a sudden realizing that life does go on," Mr. Hale said. "And for those people for whom travel is an important part of their lives, it's going to continue to be an important part of their lives."
That trend was echoed in a mid-January conference call among members of the Adventure Collection, an association of eight adventure travel companies including Backroads. "There was a sense that things were really picking up among almost every single company," Mr. Hale said.
Another member of the group, San Francisco-based Geographic Expeditions (www.geoex.com), also heard the phones ring more often in January, according to Nicholas Ballard, its marketing director.
But customers who are calling, Mr. Ballard said, are generally looking for more reassurance about the details and safety of trips. "Typically they're spending more time with our regional directors -- they have a lot of questions," he added.
Mr. Ballard's company, which often leads tours and hikes to remote areas, has temporarily discontinued programs in Indonesia and Pakistan, but has seen increased interest in domestic destinations, as well as parts of southern Africa, South Asia, the Galapagos and Central America.

DESPITE the economic and political turmoil in Argentina, South America is frequently cited as one of the international areas benefiting from changing travel patterns.
"There's absolutely tremendous interest in South America right now," said Pamela Lassers, a spokeswoman for Abercrom bie & Kent (at www.abercrombiekent.com), which specializes in more luxurious adventure trips. Ms. Lassers said bookings for South America were up 10 percent from the mid-September to mid-January period of the year before as clients changed plans from, say, a desert safari in the Middle East to an Amazon cruise and a trip to the Atacama Desert in Chile.
In response to shifting moods, Abercrombie & Kent has also added more North American trips this year, including an "active family adventure" combining rafting, hiking and horseback riding in Moab, Utah. (But not too active. "Rafting with A & K offers a wilderness experience, without the discomforts normally associated with camping," the company's promotional materials note.)
At the more rugged end of the spectrum, Outdoor Adventure River Specialists (www.oars.com), which organizes river rafting and kayaking trips, said its business had been holding up better than that of some outfitters -- partly because almost all of its trips are in North America.
Even so, Brian McCutcheon, the director of marketing, said bookings by New Yorkers -- traditionally a strong market for the company -- have been slower to recover. Other noticeable changes are that travelers are booking trips within driving distance from their homes and that more families are taking vacations together. "People are saying, 'You never know what's going to happen, I think I'd like to take a river trip with my kids before I send them off to college,' " Mr. McCutcheon said.

HEADLINE: Practical Traveler; 
Room Bargains Await in Dorms

BYLINE:  By SUSAN CATTO; SUSAN CATTO contributes to The Times from Toronto.

 BODY:
FOR vacationers who don't want to spend a fortune on hotels, one solution is to go back to school. Each summer, many colleges and universities worldwide open their residence halls to tourists. Campus lodgings are more private than hostels or bed-and-breakfasts and are often in the center of town, where hotels charge premium prices. Savings can be huge: a room in central London or in Berkeley with a view of the San Francisco Bay can cost $50 a night. 
 True, a dormitory will never be mistaken for the Ritz, but affordable does not mean uncomfortable. In most cases, the residences are run like hotels, with linens, towels, daily housekeeping and reception desks. You can usually book single-night stays; discounts are sometimes offered for longer stays or to students and seniors. Private bathrooms and even apartments are increasingly common, and single travelers, couples and families can find lodging to suit their needs. Universities usually rent their nicest, most recently renovated rooms, and typical furnishings are basic but comfortable: single beds, a desk, a wardrobe and perhaps a comfortable chair or sofa. You'll probably have to do without a TV and private phone. 
 Other amenities may include access to inexpensive student laundries, cafeterias or gyms, and many dorms have kitchenettes on each floor. Most campuses have at least two levels of security; at the London School of Economics and Political Science, for example, you need a key card to enter the dormitory, and guards patrol the grounds at night. 
To find a room, check tourist boards or campuses at your destination.

Worldwide Options
England, Scotland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Canada and Australia are particularly rich in university accommodations, with summer rentals available in major cities and smaller towns. The English Tourism Council is planning to introduce a rating system this summer assessing the cleanliness, hospitality, facilities and food quality of the nation's campus lodgings. Ratings will be posted at www.visitbritain.com. 
Most United States universities give priority to summer students and conference participants. Still, rooms may become available at the last minute, so call a university's accommodations office directly. And try your alma mater; even if it doesn'trent rooms to the public, it can sometimes find space for alumni. 
Here is a selection of facilities around the world: 
Trinity College Dublin has run a summer hotel for almost 20 years, a fraction of the college's 400-year history, but long enough to develop a devoted cadre of annual visitors. The campus's cobbled walkways, historic buildings and illuminated manuscript of the Book of Kells are tourist attractions in themselves, and the college's location is unbeatable. Grafton Street, Temple Bar and Dublin's museums are steps away. 
From mid-June to late September, Trinity is almost like a hotel, with student bellhops, daily housekeeping and a concierge desk. "It was easy, it was cheap, the rooms were big and the bathrooms were in excellent condition," said Anna Taylor, a London student who stayed at Trinity in 1998. The college rents out 800 rooms; prices (with Continental breakfast) range from $33 a person (at 1.17 euros to the dollar) for a shared room in a four-bedroom apartment to $49.50 for a single room with private bathroom and shower. A double room with bath is $43 a person. Trinity College Dublin Accommodation Office, West Chapel, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland; (353-1) 608-1177, fax (353-1) 671-1267. Booking forms and photos of the rooms are at www .tcd.ie/conferences/visitor.htm. 
The London School of Economics and Political Science offers five properties in London, ranging from high-rise apartments near the Tower of London to the Bloomsbury row houses where Mick Jagger lived as a student. Residences have kitchen facilities and three of the five have triple rooms, making even a family holiday affordable. 
The 563-room Bankside House, opposite Tate Modern on the South Bank, is a minute's walk from Shakespeare's Globe Theatre; singles start at $39 (at $1.46 to the pound) -- $63 with private bath -- and a room that sleeps four is $128 a night. The High Holborn residence in Covent Garden is a short walk from the National Gallery, Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square. Singles are $51 and a twin room with private bath is $99. Rates include Continental or full breakfast, depending on location. Rooms are available from early July to late September, with some dormitories accepting visitors during Easter vacations. The School of Economics central accommodations office is at (44-207) 955 7575; Web site, www.lse.ac.uk/vacations. 
In Austria, Academia Hotels offers a central reservation service for summer campus housing in Vienna, Salzburg and Graz. At Hotel Atlas, a modern tower block near Vienna's Parliament Buildings, a single room with toilet is $49.50, twins are $68 and a triple room is $85, with buffet breakfast. 
Hotel Schwarzes Rossl in Salzburg is in a gorgeous 16th-century building near the city center. Rooms have wash basins, but bathrooms are shared; a single with Continental breakfast is $27. Rooms are available from the beginning of July to the end of September. Academia Hotels, Pfeilgasse 3A, A-1080 Vienna; (43-1) 40176 extension 55 or 77, or at www .academia-hotels.co.at. 
Near San Francisco, the University of California at Berkeley has summer visitor housing in Stern Hall from the beginning of June through mid-August. Some rooms have views of the Bay, and there are telephones in every room. Bathrooms are shared. Single rooms cost $53, doubles are $68, and every seventh night is free. Call Conference Services at (510) 642-4444 or reserve on the Internet at www.housing.berkeley.edu /conference/summervis. 
Summer is festival season in Montreal, and McGill University rents convenient single rooms with shared bathrooms from May 15 to Aug. 15. Access to the university swimming pool, tennis courts and gym can be arranged for a small fee. Rooms in the dormitories alongside tranquil, forested Mount Royal Park are $25 (at $1.62 Canadian to the United States dollar), while rooms downtown are $28. An off-campus residence, Solin Hall, has two- and three-bedroom apartments suitable for families, but linens are not provided and availability varies. Rates are $22 a night per room and $80 a week per room. Apartments have kitchens but no cooking equipment; (514) 398-5200, or www.residences .mcgill.ca/summer.html. 
The Women's College at the University of Sydney takes visitors of either sex December through February and during several shorter breaks in July and late September. A 15-minute bus or train ride from downtown, the Women's College is known for its gardens. Rooms start at $31 for a single with breakfast (at $1.97 Australian to the United States dollar); a twin with all meals is $60.

What They Were Thinking

BYLINE:  By Catherine Saint Louis 

 BODY:
 Roman Tsukerman, Mineola, N.Y., Feb. 9, 2002

"That's my room in my parents' house on Long Island. The weekend before, I moved all my stuff back there. My apartment back in Manhattan wasn't any bigger than this -- except the room in my parents' house is free, and my studio was $1,000. If I wanted to, I could live in Brooklyn, but if I can't live in Manhattan, I would rather live with my parents.
 "I'm in advertising. I got laid off back in April. I'm 27. It definitely stinks to have your mother asking you to clean your room. But it's not as bad as when you've lived at home for two years after college. My parents were getting antsy -- telling me I'd have to pay rent. This time, they don't see my lack of a job as laziness. They kind of understand that it's about the economy. Although they say, they would go scrub dishes, they would go and work at McDonald's. They came from Russia. When they were my age, they already had a family. If I was in that situation, with a wife and kids, I don't know how I'd deal. My parents had to work much harder. In my career, you could double your salary every year. If I find a job, I'm not going to make less than $70,000 -- which is not even that much. My friends make more." interview by Catherine Saint Louis

Caribbean Asks, Where's the Peak?

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
TOURIST industry officials in the Caribbean and the Bahamas did not expect 2002 to be a banner year, but the region was hoping for an improvement over 2001. The lingering fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, however, has dashed that hope by keeping many Americans close to home this winter. And the weather -- unseasonably warm in much of the country -- has also conspired against the islands.
 The fallout is apparent in statistics compiled by the Caribbean Tourism Organization: until the attacks, overall Caribbean tourism was up 4.6 percent from January through August over the same period in 2000. And despite a plunge of 23 percent from mid-September through October, the region still managed to finish 2001 with a decline of only 0.8 percent. 
 But January was a different story. While occupancy at some resorts and hotels is inching back up, room rates generally remain low. And almost everywhere across the Caribbean, which is now midway through its traditional high season, bookings have lagged badly. 
With many Americans still hesitant to fly, the islands' salvation has been the cruise ships, whose passengers either drove to Florida ports to board the ships, or overcame their apprehension long enough to fly there. Although cruise passengers have little effect on hotel occupancy, except to stay a night or two before or after a sailing, many of them spend money at local restaurants and businesses.
But it will take more than that to lift the Caribbean islands out of the doldrums. Not only are many Americans, who account for about 48 percent of the Caribbean's 20 million-plus annual visitors, still staying away, so are Europeans, who account for about 28 percent. Britons, however, have been arriving on tour packages in the past few weeks at such former colonies as Barbados, Antigua and Jamaica, according to Michael Youngman, director of marketing for the Caribbean Tourism Organization. But in the broader picture that may be a case of too little, too late.
Cuba, though largely closed to United States tourists, is also struggling through its worst tourist season since opening its beaches to foreigners soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. John Kavulich, president of the New York-based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said that tourism to Cuba was down about 30 percent last month -- 20 to 25 percent in Havana and 30 to 40 percent in the eastern resort of Varadero, which together account for about half of all Cuban tourism.
While terrorism is mainly responsible for the Caribbean's woes, local crime is also a factor. For example, in Jamaica, more than 1,300 people were murdered last year, although most of the victims were members of rival gangs, involved in the drug trade or killed in Kingston, far from Ocho Rios and the island's tourist centers.
With it all, some hotels and resorts appear to be riding out the slump, although not without offering discounts and free amenities.
The Sonesta Beach Resorts in Aruba and Bermuda, for example, are offering free air fare through March 31, and Sonesta's resort in Anguilla offers a fourth night free through April 5. As usual, restrictions apply. 
"Our occupancy is down around 70 percent instead of in the 80's, and rates aren't what they should be because normally we'd never offer those kinds of deals," said Bill Murphy, vice president of sales and marketing for Sonesta. "But the more creative you are with your packages, the better chance you have of gaining market share." 
Jay Litt, the head of resort operations for Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, sees a reason for optimism. Although the average room rate is down between 6 and 8 percent throughout Wyndham's 10 Caribbean properties, occupancy continues to rise. "The average rates always come back slower than occupancy," he said, "but that's normal. And little by little we're going in the right direction."
Through April 30, guests who stay three consecutive nights at any of the six Wyndham resorts in the Caribbean -- in Jamaica, St. Maarten, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, St. Thomas and Grand Cayman -- receive a fourth night free. 
Not all Caribbean hotels are going in the right direction, however. Weak bookings caused several hotels on St. Lucia to close this winter, while the island's 285-room Hyatt Regency was notified in December that a receiver had been appointed to supervise the hotel; reservations will not be accepted for stays beyond March 25. 
To add to the island's misfortunes, Club Med announced, also in December, that low bookings had made it necessary to close its St. Lucia property. At about the same time Club Med also closed two of its properties in the Bahamas -- on Columbus Isle and Eleuthera. Valerie Bihet, a Club Med spokeswoman, said that the company plans to reopen all three properties in November or December for the winter season.

 Just this year, after an exhausting (but by no means exhaustive) itinerary gleaned from Web sites and press releases, one could biennial-hop through 17 cities in 15 countries, starting with the International Painting Biennial in Cuenca, Ecuador, and ending with what is perhaps the first binational biennial, Kulturbro, put together jointly by Denmark and Sweden. 
 Last year's roster was no less packed. There were more than 16 international biennials, ranging from the 49th Venice Biennial -- the grande dame of them all -- to the first ever Tirana Biennial, in Albania, held last fall. International biennials, it's clear, are the art world system du jour -- and their proliferation is raising issues and angst, not to mention jetlag, among art people everywhere. 
It was only a matter of time before artists began to make work about biennials and their tendency to multiply. The satirical "Super(M)art," an installation by the Thai artist Navin Rawanchaikul now on view at the newly reopened Palais de Tokyo in Paris, is a large, multipart work that purports to look 50 years into the future. In the work, major museums have collapsed and enterprises like "$; uratorman Inc.," are the new cultural arbiters, specializing in "biennale franchising."
The installation's tour de force is an enormous painting that parodies Paolo Veronese's extravagant "Wedding Feast at Cana." Filled with recognizable curators, critics and artists, it enshrines past and present art-world regulars on biennial circuits in a sort of eternal vernissage. Many of these professionals will undoubtedly be on hand in June when this year's main event, Documenta XI (technically a quinquennial, held every five years) opens in Kassel, Germany. 
The United States, meanwhile, hasn't really jumped on the blockbuster biennial bandwagon. There are the Whitney Biennial, opening in New York on Thursday, the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh and Site Santa Fe in New Mexico. Even so, these events are single-institution, in-house affairs, without the grand scale, public financing and underlying ambitions of civic promotion. (Dave Hickey, the curator of last year's Site Santa Fe, deliberately aimed for an antibiennial format. Biennials, he told ArtForum, are essentially trade shows for international curators that ignore the primary experience of viewing art.) 
Factors beyond aesthetics, like local cultural promotion, market forces and newly emerged national or civic identities, do seem to drive the biennial trend. The Web site of the Scandinavian Kulturbro explains that the event was "formed in the context of the political decision to build a bridge" between Denmark and Sweden. Its intentions, it goes on, were "to put the region on the map internationally and reinforce the relationship between the two countries." In Korea, Prof. Wan-Kyung Sung, the artistic director of this year's fourth Gwangju Biennial, said in an e-mail interview that his event's most important mission was to continue to examine the legacy of a bloody student uprising in Gwangju in 1980.
Perhaps no festival uses culture to reify the civic soul more than Documenta. The event was started in 1955 to counter the Nazis' branding modern German art "degenerate" and to help a war-ravaged city reclaim a place in modern culture. 
Kassel has spent lavishly on Documenta over the years, and in the opening days of the 1997 edition, busloads of German pensioners were seen going through the exhibitions. But other cities have had financial troubles. Johannesburg held its first biennial in 1995 with great hope after the lifting of apartheid, only to see the 1997 edition shut down overnight, two months early, as city money was abruptly withdrawn. It has yet to be revived. The artistic director that year was Okwui Enwezor, the current curator of Documenta. The causes of the Johannesburg event's failure are still being discussed, but most people agree it was economics and a lack of local political support.
The biennial trend has been studied by the international art world. Conferences and panels have been convened, and official studies are being prepared. Claude Gosselin, director of the Biennale de Montreal, said that a 1997 conference in Tenerife, Spain, and a later one in Kassel raised several issues, most interestingly one about how the biennial model is being co-opted from art professionals by city promoters -- a sure sign that market forces are at work. 
"It is the exception, but it is beginning to happen," Mr. Gosselin said. "The biennials recently put on the map have been organized by people from the field, so we are still in good hands." Also discussed at the conferences were the unwieldy size of some exhibitions, excessively esoteric curatorial themes and how often the same curators keep showing the same artists. 
"But," Mr. Gosselin added, "I always find new artists when I go to biennials. And many new curators are becoming involved. In this year's Manifesto 4 in Frankfurt in June, for instance, the curators are quite young. In recent years, museums and universities in Canada and elsewhere haven't hired many new curators or art historians, so biennials provide a chance for the younger ones to work, and they usually present new artists."
Mr. Gosselin, who has worked for a decade establishing the Biennale de Montreal and is now preparing its third edition, also suggested that biennials, which get extra attention from the news media, give contemporary art a higher profile in host cities than local museums or galleries can provide. 
The question of just whom biennials are really for is an intriguing one. It's hard for some Westerners to accept third world cities' spending money on contemporary art exhibitions, mostly attended by foreigners, while services for their citizens, like clean water, may still be lacking. 
Homi Bhabha, a professor of English at Harvard University, writes frequently for ArtForum and has lectured at various biennials (including one last fall in Berlin at one of the preliminary "platform" segments for Documenta XI). He is also a native of Bombay. "I am very interested in the way countries and societies that can least afford it treat arts or cultural events as show windows," he said. "It reminds me of Bertolt Brecht's sentiments, 'grub first, ethics later,' or in this case, grub first, aesthetics later. But somehow it doesn't work that way, because of the deep penetration of the media in most societies -- media being in our time the major mirror, or screen, of cultural status and recognition. 
"Having a biennial reveals a desire to be seen as a region of modern culture. Even in countries of economic and political hardship, they provide a virtual sense of being part of a technologically connected world."
Both Mr. Bhabha and Mr. Gosselin believe biennials have trumped museums as a means of anointing new talent, which is good news indeed for "$; uratorMan, Inc." 
As mega-events, however, biennials may be a troubled form. Last month, the Venice Biennale approached bureaucratic meltdown as it was announced that the entire biennial committee and chairman had resigned amid wrangling over political and artistic control. (Robert Hughes, the Time magazine art critic known for his conservative taste, and a neophyte curator, is one person who has been approached about organizing the 2003 biennale.)
In fact, some professionals see down-scaling -- call it a countermovement against globalism -- and events held outside Europe or the United States as the real trend. This is the view of Masahiro Ushiroshoji, the curator of the Fukuoka, Japan, Asian Art Museum and its Triennale, which opens this month. His exhibition focuses on 21 Asian countries, including places like Nepal, Bhutan and Cambodia where art-world players aren't often seen and contemporary art is still an evolving concept. 
In the last triennale, Bhutan's entry was an ornately carved and painted wood Buddhist altar, which curators admitted did not actually meet current notions of contemporary art. The juxtaposition of traditional craft with first-world conceptual art gave a glimpse of globalism in action. Another work, from Pakistan, consisted of a decorated van, a collaboration between a team of professionally trained artists and traditional Pakistani truck decorators. Photographs of trucks created by the artisans alone, however, were even more spectacular. 
One wonders if biennials are shaping art, and, if so, which way the influence runs. Video was ubiquitous at the last Venice Biennale; it is also highly portable and easily reproduced and therefore can be shown in several exhibitions at once. Some fear that it's becoming a kind of universal art form, often with more form than art. Yuko Hasegawa, a curator from Japan who was artistic director of the Seventh International Istanbul Biennial, held last fall, said the issue of homogenization of contemporary art, and video in particular, wasn't that easy to sort out. "These works increased, first of all, from the creative reality of artists," she said. "Cost effectiveness is only a factor." 
Professor Sung of Gwangju, on the other hand, thinks there is a disturbing trend for big-budget multimedia or video installations. "Artists are using the latest high-tech, high-cost equipment, requiring high production fees reflected only in presentation rather than quality," he said. "We need to re-evaluate the value of traditional art forms since they're losing ground." 
Ms. Hasegawa said that Western influence is a concern. "Cutting-edge, mainstream artworks are exhibited in all the biennials," she said. "As a result, these same works are introduced all around the world and have become ubiquitous. It's crucial to promote discussions and feedback in the locales where biennials occur." She purposely spent two months in Istanbul, trying to absorb the richness of the cultural mix. Even so, and paradoxically, her exhibition has been criticized for including too few unknowns and too many Western "name" artists. 
Reporting on biennials, Ms. Hasegawa said, especially by the Western press, often fails to delve adequately into local specifics. Journalists, she thinks, should do more than "parachute" into an exotically located biennial, file a report and then move on to the next one. "These events are activating art," she said, "but not homogenizing it into a single global aesthetic. If they appear to be, it's because the underlying art market and critical writing are still centered mainly in Europe and North America. It's also crucial to have curators from outside Western art centers." 
A single global aesthetic is simply not possible, Mr. Bhabha said, even though both uniformity and heterogeneity are at work in biennials. "The global art market might create some uniform conditions of recognition and visibility," he said. "But at the same time these art shows are only as interesting as different regions can present something distinctive." 
Besides, he pointed out, globalism, which can be traced to the use Primitivism by the Cubists, is not that new. "Modernism, from the 1920's at least, had various aspirations to become an international movement," he said. "Conceptual Art, the International Style, Constructivism, Abstract Expressionism, all these have aspired to some kind of universalism without regional markers. 
"As an example of globalism before globalism," he continued, "outside Madras, India, there's a famous artists' colony, where over the last 30 or 40 years the artists have been making detailed studies of American minimalism and abstraction and have a particular interest in the work of Ad Reinhardt." 
Mr. Bhabha finds a subtle metaphor for globalism as a fait accompli in the sartorial style of Hamid Karzai, the leader of Afghanistan's interim government: "Karzai's style, partly modern, partly traditional, is being read as trying to bring validity to both past and present, to give a precarious balance. That is exactly where we are at the moment. It is an interesting juxtaposition. And a lot of contemporary art is about juxtaposition."
Meanwhile, back at the Palais de Tokyo, there is an unlikely but auspicious coincidence -- within a large billboard in Mr. Rawanchaikul's installation an imaginary New York Times headline announces the 2052 Biennale of Kabul.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Ethical Quandaries, Pivotal Boundaries

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
AS Italians say at election time, piazza pulita! -- let's clean up the square! The clearing of ground zero has proceeded much faster than expected, and it is not too soon to think about cleaning up the politics of redeveloping the site. Indeed, the 16-acre property is now a zone of convergence for our top two national crises: 9/11 and Enron. Architecture is a cultural medium in which this convergence will be conspicuously manifested.
 Secrecy and accountability: these are the two issues the convergence has raised. They are, of course, at odds. The status quo relies on secrecy to retain and enlarge power. ("Trust us; we're reliable.") In this sense, the climate of emergency fostered by the war on terrorism has been a godsend for every status quo. ("Certain things we can't talk about.") By the same token, the collapse of Enron threatens every status quo. It exposes secrecy as the currency that enables people and institutions to evade responsibility for their actions. 
 How much accountability can we stand? How willing or eager are we to be kept in the dark? How much ethical compromise does it take to keep the world from falling apart? And who gets to arbitrate such contentious issues, particularly in the cultural sphere? Like it or not, ground zero has become a theater where these questions will be played out. 
Over time, writers will probe every facet of the political, cultural and economic forces now jostling over places on the stage. For now, it may suffice to say: We are watching you! History will be judging you! If decisionmakers treat this project as no more than a local exercise in economic development, goosed up by fatuous public relations, they will be weighed in the scales and found wanting, for as long as history sustains a regard for truth.
In fact, the moving hand has already begun to inscribe some fairly lurid writing on the walls. Within days of the terrorist attacks, as the recovery of bodies from the towering wreckage was barely under way, ground zero was officially declared a construction site. This declaration was the direct cause of the scuffle between police officers and firefighters in November, when the latter group sought access to the ground where many of their colleagues had lost their lives.
This wasn't just a technicality. It announced not only that construction would go forward, but also that the site was officially privatized. You and I and the entire rest of the world might suppose that, by dint of cataclysm, we all might have a stake in this piece of property, but that was our problem. Rudolph Giuliani had declared that we must think like capitalists, not communists. Take that, comrades!
Obnoxious as the mayor's statement was, at least it placed the city on notice that a giant cash register had already materialized within the smoke. Why bother with a design competition? We could just build four stretch versions of the iconic National Cash Register Pavilion from the 1939 World's Fair. Nice Art Deco lines. Reduced to miniature size, it would make a fine piggy-bank souvenir. Ka-ching!
The acceptance of ground zero as a construction site began filtering into the media when the observation platform went up on Trinity Place. Visitors to ground zero deserved "something more than" a construction site, it was said. Never mind that no one was actually going there to see something they didn't even recognize as a construction site. Never mind that building construction is one of the great spectacles of Manhattan, or that few buildings are even remotely as interesting when completed as they are in construction. Usually, "something more" turns out to be immensely less.
In any case, as conceived by its designers, the platform was never intended for conventional sidewalk superintendents. It was meant to offer a vantage point on history, as it unfolded in real time. That history included the buildings that had stood there, among them those before the Twin Towers were built; the towers themselves and their destruction; the spectacle of clearing the site; fantasies about its future; and the hardening of fantasy into implementation. Above all, what people wanted to see was a site of military aggression. Not a battlefield, perhaps, but certainly a field of slaughter. (In fact, members of the Architectural History Foundation have proposed that Congress declare ground zero a historic battlefield and place it under federal supervision, whether or not it is commercially developed.)
Metaphorically, the platform serves the ideal of public oversight: the idea that public officials should be held accountable for their actions. By extension, the design signifies the idea that the public should be more assertive in holding officials accountable. Oversight, we should keep in mind, is not a passive occupation but a means of engaging with power.
Other commentators accused the platform of converting ground zero into a tourist attraction, as if it were a ride at Disney World. This remark should not be casually dismissed. In fact, it touches on a deeper truth than the commentators may have realized. The relationship between warfare and tourism is one of the open secrets of modern life. It was the topic of "Back to the Front: Tourisms of War," a 1994 book edited by two of the platform's designers, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, who have been exploring the subject for years.
The development of battle sites as tourist attractions; the dependence of tourism on technology invented for military purposes; the similarity of war and tourism as instruments for the penetration of national borders: "See the World." See the World Trade Center. Architecture is not just the visual forms of buildings but also the cultural relationships they reflect.
In short, criticisms of the platform have degraded history, language and thought. Or, rather, they reflect the degree to which thought is routinely degraded by market values. This is not the same as economic corruption. And we would all naturally go into hiding should Congress open hearings on the corruption of ideas. Nonetheless, for those who haven't given up hope that the redevelopment of lower Manhattan will rise to a sense of historical occasion, cultural corruption is not a minor detail.
Real estate speculation in New York is governed by a concept called the "public-private partnership." In forthcoming columns, I will examine the workings of this concept as it applies to ground zero and to the agencies, private firms and civic and professional groups involved with the decisionmaking process. Here, I'll confine myself to sketching its general contour.
Public-private partnerships are an outgrowth of privatization. Typically, the private sector provides planning and design services along with capital investment. The public sector provides permits and assists with land acquisition and zoning interpretation. It may also require developers to provide improvements in the public interest, including parks and recreational areas; remodeled subway stations; and community centers, health clinics and other nonprofit services.
The public-private partnership has replaced the centralized model of city planning adopted during the Depression, and is generally regarded as an improvement on that model, or at least as less likely to produce the homogeneous, towers-in-a-park formula associated with low-income housing projects that proliferated in the postwar decades. It has been embraced here as an example of the so-called "third way," through which the public sector seeks to unburden itself from the costs and defects of the welfare state by elevating the social responsibility of private enterprise.
BATTERY PARK CITY and the redevelopment of 42nd Street are especially ambitious examples of public-private partnerships, though the concept is routinely applied as well in the development of individual buildings, including the future headquarters of The New York Times. It's fair to say that the concept is as good as the ideas driving its particular application. Its greatest strength, perhaps, is its capacity to try out new ideas -- to take risks and to learn from shortcomings as they materialize. Its greatest weakness is its tendency to curb public oversight by restricting access to the decisionmaking process.
By virtue of the powers invested in the newly created Lower Manhattan Development Authority, the rebuilding of the financial district will be the most important public-private development partnership in the city's history. Its domain is not limited to ground zero, but penetrates into surrounding neighborhoods as far north as Chambers Street. Quite apart from the historical magnitude of the events that led to its creation, the Authority has the power to transform the public face of Manhattan for future generations.
What ideas, if any, will drive the transformation? Where will the ideas come from? How and why will some ideas come to be preferred over others? And who will hold the decisionmakers accountable? To what extent, and in what form, should public oversight penetrate behind closed doors?
The pivotal issue here is that of boundaries. A public-private partnership is an economic and cultural ecotone -- an area of overlap between the public and private spheres. In nature, an ecotone can support life forms not found in its adjacent ecosystems. It can develop vibrant new structures of life. An ecotone may also foster new species of predators, however, including some with remarkable camouflage. In architecture, as in power companies, their eating habits deserve close observation.

HEADLINE: Taking Out the Trash . . . to the Big Cities 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KOLBER

 BODY:
WHEN Peter Davis became New Haven's river keeper 15 years ago, he removed 4 million pounds of debris from the city's waterways. But since this summer, the rate of illegal dumping in the city's rivers and parks has doubled, Mr. Davis said, and he has had to work nearly nonstop just to keep the car engines, shopping carts and tires from clogging the city's three rivers.
 "The key is this could add up so quickly if we don't get on top of it," Mr. Davis said. 
 Throughout the state, cities have seen a surge in illegally dumped rubbish in recent months and state environmental officials aren't sure why. They speculate that warm weather and lax enforcement have encouraged homeowners and contractors to take this path, which lets them avoid paying the fees that many dumps charge to accept large items. 
Officials said they believed the cities have become magnets because they have plenty of back alleys and highway underpasses where garbage can be discretely dumped.
On one point, Mr. Davis and his colleagues are fairly certain: many of the dumpers are coming from the suburbs.
"Hartford, in essence, has become a dumping ground for economic reasons," said Oscar Mejia of Hartford Areas Rally Together.
The State Department of Environmental Protection and local authorities have been able to trace some of the dumping to suburbanites through labels or identifying marks on the rubbish. A Waterbury official, for example, searched the contents of a discarded floppy disk to find a rogue dumper. The dumper was fined $300 and ordered to clean up the garbage.
In Hartford, Bryan West, the waste management superintendent, said he can tell the debris is coming from out of town because of its character -- trash collectors are finding piles of branches dumped in front of two-family homes that don't have any trees.
The problem has gotten so bad, particularly in Hartford, New Haven, and Waterbury, that in late January the D.E.P. and local authorities began nighttime stakeouts of dumping hot spots. They made only one arrest, perhaps because dumpers had heard about the stakeouts.
Jacquelyn Pernell, the dumping investigator in the D.E.P.'s environmental equity division, has been working with officials from cities to trace refuse and has been issuing summonses when she is able to find the dumpers.
"They're bringing boats, stoves, drugs, asbestos," Ms. Pernell said.
Since the D.E.P. crackdown began in January, Ms. Pernell said the rate of illegal dumping in city centers has slowed. Ms. Pernell said she has been able to trace some dumping back to auto body shops. In January, Ms. Pernell issued a summons to Larry Percy, the owner of Percy's Auto Body Shop on Walnut Street in Hartford. Ms. Pernell was able to use vehicle identification numbers on auto parts found under a Hartford bridge to trace the dumping back to Mr. Percy's shop. Mr. Percy said he had been bringing his discarded cars to a local dump until a few months ago, when it closed. 
Since then, he had been paying a man, whose name he did not know, around $20 to truck off his discarded parts to an out-of-town dump. When Ms. Pernell fined him, Mr. Percy said he realized the other man had just been dumping the auto parts on the street all along.
Mr. Percy said the trucker was pocketing the cash, instead of paying fees at the dump. Since he was fined, Mr. Percy said his company has taken its refuse to the dump on its own.
Bridgeport is in better condition than some other cities. There police seize the vehicles of people found illegally dumping, and since the city stopped bulk pick-ups a decade ago, there have been fewer instances of dumping, City Council President John Fabrizi said.
Bulk collection stopped since the city could no longer afford the $2.5 million annual cost, but the change has also benefited the city since suburban homeowners are no longer encouraged to bring their refuse into town, Mr. Fabrizi said. In Waterbury, new ordinances and increased vigilance by neighborhood groups have encouraged city departments to expend more effort on stopping illegal dumping.
"The cleanliness of the city has become one of the No. 1 complaints among quality of life complaints in the city of Waterbury," said Kathleen McNamara, president of the Waterbury Neighborhood Council, a coalition of 12 neighborhood groups.
Late last year Waterbury created an anti-litter and beautification commission to coordinate efforts between city departments. New ordinances created part-time litter control positions, but with the city's fiscal instability, even Ms. McNamara questions whether those new jobs can be filled.
Michael Gilmore, Waterbury's community development coordinator, said unconventional tactics like the nighttime stakeouts have been working. "We're getting a better grasp on it now," Mr. Gilmore said.
Nevertheless, the limited success of crackdowns on dumping may make further enforcement more difficult. Mr. Gilmore said dumpers are learning to remove identifying marks from the material.
"I think they're getting smarter," Mr. Gilmore said. "They take out the receipt from the Home Depot now."
Mr. Gilmore has found that some illegal dumping has been at the hands of contractors who agree to haul rubbish to dumps, but end up just throwing it in vacant lots or sidewalks.
A Waterbury man, Benjamin De Jesus, was fined $300 when items from his home were found dumped in downtown Waterbury Feb. 7. Mr. De Jesus said he paid a man $500 to clean out his garage. He expected the rubbish to be brought to the city dump, which would have accepted the items for free.
When Mr. De Jesus explained this in court, a judge dismissed the fine against Mr. De Jesus and investigators pursued the hauler. Mr. Gilmore was able to identify Mr. De Jesus because among the personal items dumped were bills addressed to him.
Mr. De Jesus said he has removed his items from the lot and disposed of them properly.
"I want to see it clean," Mr. De Jesus said. "This is criminal."
Waterbury's best hope for cleaning the city may be volunteer efforts.
Ms. McNamara said that during a recent clean-up her group organized, volunteers removed car engines and refrigerators from the Naugatuck River.
In Hartford, a community group met with the city in January to protest conditions on Wellington Street, which is near Interstate 84 and the south branch of the Park River. The road used to be filled with rusting cars and loose tires. After a recent cleanup, cement barricades were placed at each end of the street to prevent further dumping, but small items like furniture and clothing still litter the street.
"This is beautiful compared to what it was," Mr. Mejia said.
But in New Haven the situation isn't getting any better. On Feb. 1, Mr. Davis said he found the worst dumping he has seen yet.
Around 8 a.m., he discovered a 30-foot trailer abandoned on Poplar Street, near River Street. Inside were four 55-gallon drums filled with oil, two refrigerators and an underground storage tank. The D.E.P. removed the tanks and the state police are investigating.
New Haven officials said dumping problems have increased since the New Haven detective who was assigned to police illegal dumpers retired last year. His position is not expected to be filled due to the city's budget crunch.
But the police chief does plan to assign an officer to act as a liaison with other city agencies on dumping problems. Judith Mongillo, a spokeswoman for the New Haven Police Department, said all officers should be looking for illegal dumping on their beats.
"Essentially those matters are handled by patrol," Ms. Mongillo said.
Mr. Davis, who as New Haven river keeper organizes canoe trips of the Quinnipiac, West and Mill rivers and keeps them clean, spends much of his time removing large appliances from neighborhoods adjacent to the rivers because he is afraid that even legally dumped items that are awaiting collection could end up in the rivers at the hands of children.
"The kids love seeing the splash," Mr. Davis said. "It's too hard for them not to do it."
On a particularly warm Tuesday morning in January, Mr. Davis was able to fill the back of his truck with shopping carts, tires and children's bicycles he found discarded along the West and Quinnipiac rivers. He was about to call it a day when he saw a washing machine sitting in an empty lot at Front and Lombard streets, along the Quinnipiac in the city's Fair Haven neighborhood.
Mr. Davis wanted to pick up the machine immediately, "otherwise I need to get it out of the Quinnipiac and that's going to be harder."
He drove to the city's old landfill, which is now just used as a transfer station to ship trash to other cities, and unloaded the back of his Parks Department truck. He threw tires into a dumpster that will be shipped to Bridgeport, where the tires will be burned.
"Poor Bridgeport," Mr. Davis said.
By the end of the day he is covered with mud and dirt. His truck acquires the odors of the rubbish he collects.
"My wife makes me go in the back door and take off all my clothes before I come in," Mr. Davis said.
When he returned to Front Street to pick up the washing machine, Monte Lewis, who lived on Lombard Street, said people from outside the neighborhood frequently drop their trash there.
"Some contractors dump sheet rock here," Ms. Lewis said. "That doesn't surprise me."

HEADLINE: Chicago Developer Capitalizes on Transit Access 

BYLINE:  By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
A CHURCH-based community development corporation on Chicago's west side is using a recently modernized rail transit line as the backbone of an ambitious retail and single family home development plan that it hopes will transform some of this city's toughest streets. 
 One of the two pillars in Bethel New Life's development plan is Parkside Estates, an urban enclave of handsome two-story, three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath, single-family houses on North Hamlin Boulevard in the West Garfield Park neighborhood. They are two blocks from a busy shopping district on West Madison Street, one block from the elevated Lake-Pulaski rail station on Chicago's Green Line and across the street from Garfield Park. Both the neighborhood elementary and middle schools are within a 10-minute walk. 
 The other pillar is a planned $4 million, 23,000-square-foot Transit Center that is to include shops and restaurants on the first floor, a day-care center and employment office on the second floor and a walkway that connects the building to the Lake-Pulaski station. The Transit Center, which is to produce some of its own energy with photovoltaic generators, was designed by Doug Farr and Kevin Pierce, Chicago architects. 
The retail space is being marketed by James Matanky, whose firm, Matanky Realty Group, specializes in selling space in new and renovated inner city buildings and is also a joint venture partner with Bethel New Life in the Transit Center. 
Demolition of the existing store on the site is to start in mid-March, with construction scheduled to begin in early May. The bulk of the financing for the Transit Center project is to come from $3.5 million in city, state and federal grants. The balance -- $500,000 -- comes from a construction loan and from Bethel New Life. 
Together, Chicago city planners say, Parkside Estates and the Transit Center are proving that some of the same promising demographic and economic trends that are strengthening the Loop, Chicago's central business and retail district, are also helping to revive low-income and minority neighborhoods. 
"We've seen quite a renaissance downtown, and what we've been trying to do is push development west and repopulate neighborhoods like West Garfield Park," said Brenda McKenzie, Chicago's deputy commissioner of planning and development. "Parkside Estates does that and so will the Transit Center. The main thing in the urban development game is know-how and persistence. Bethel New Life and Mary Nelson, the director, have that." 
Founded in 1979 as the nonprofit social service arm of Bethel Lutheran Church, a prominent house of worship and a civic institution since it was founded in 1897, Bethel New Life has specialized in redeveloping existing inner city properties. Bethel New Life has renovated more than 1,000 apartments for the poor and elderly in West Garfield Park and transformed the shuttered St. Anne's Hospital and its 9.2-acre campus into a center of housing, job training, health care and performing arts. 
Those projects and several smaller ones, Bethel New Life says, have generated more than $100 million in economic activity in West Garfield Park, which is finally recovering from a series of race riots in the 1960's. The riots accelerated white flight to the suburbs and left the community with 23,000 residents, 60 percent below its peak population, and worrisome rates of drug abuse, crime and unemployment.
Parkside Estates and the Transit Center represent a refinement of Bethel's development strategy. The projects constitute the first test of the organization's ability to build new structures and are intended to help redefine the neighborhood's reputation. 
"Developing in city neighborhoods like this one takes a lot more than assembling land, financing and a marketing strategy," said Ms. Nelson, who has served as Bethel New Life's president since its founding. "You say to yourself and your partners, 'How do we incorporate all of the things that will make our development succeed in an environment where people have become accustomed to hardship and failure and lenders don't expect success?' "
PART of the answer, explained Ms. Nelson and members of her staff, is to be much more methodical, patient and farsighted than most developers can afford to be. Another part is to reach out to influential civic leaders, other nonprofit organizations, lenders and city agencies. 
By almost any standard, the custom-built homes at Parkside Estates, which start at $145,000 and sell at the rate of roughly eight a year, are a bargain. Sitting on 30-by-125-foot lots, the homes come with full basements and energy-efficient lighting and insulation that significantly reduces utility costs.
Bethel is developing the homes on its own, and buyers can qualify for grants of up to $40,000 from New Homes for Chicago, part of a $100 million bond-financed program sponsored by the city to encourage home ownership among low-income households. While Bethel is selling the homes to any interested buyer, with no income ceilings, grants from the city program are pegged to income. For families of four, the $40,000 grant would go to a household with a maximum income of $40,740, with decreasing amounts available for those with incomes of up to $61,000. 
In addition, buyers are eligible for "location efficient" mortgages, a two-year-old mortgage instrument backed by Fannie Mae, the nation's leading buyer of home loans, which enables buyers who use public transportation or have only one car to qualify for larger loans. Under the terms of the mortgages, lenders can stretch the standard debt-to-income ratios because borrowers are estimated to be saving $300 to $500 a month in auto-related expenses. For example, for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7 percent, having an additional $300 a month directed toward a mortgage payment instead of a car would yield a mortgage approximately $40,000 higher than otherwise. 
When completed, the 50-home development will have a total cost of $6.25 million. Home sales are financing most of the cost, with the balance coming from city housing grants, says Angela Vick, Bethel's vice president of real estate development.
Half of the lots were made available at no cost to Bethel New Life by the Chicago Department of Housing after vacant buildings were demolished. The other lots, many of them empty, were acquired by Bethel through tax sales and averaged less than $300 each. Half of Parkside Estates has been built, Ms. Vick said. 
Just as crucial as its success in helping low-income residents become homeowners is the role that Parkside Estates is playing in what Ms. Nelson calls a "bold and audacious" plan that Bethel has set in motion to improve the quality of life in the entire West Garfield Park neighborhood. That plan includes more than 100 more single-family homes in two other neighborhood developments that would be valued at nearly $20 million. Bethel has also been working to attract a bank to build a branch office on land partly owned by the agency near the train station and a supermarket for a site a block away.
The catalyst for Bethel's development plan, which urban specialists say is one of the most ambitious transit-oriented developments of any low-income urban neighborhood in the nation, was the Chicago Transit Authority. In 1992 the transit agency announced that because of declining ridership it wanted to close the entire Green Line.
Ms. Nelson joined a group of community leaders to call on the transit agency to modernize the line instead. In July 1993, the transit authority agreed and introduced a new $300 million capital project to rebuild the Green Line, which was completed in 1996.
Annual ridership of the line, which was 3.9 million in 1993, has increased about 10 percent a year since construction was completed, and was 6.2 million last year.

You Call This a Bank? Keep the Change

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
I LIVE in a town of about 8,000 people, which makes it a real small town, the kind that has a Memorial Day parade every year with antique cars and antique veterans. Later this month, there will be the annual pancake breakfast in the social hall of the local church, which will kick off the outdoor season. My town is small enough that I know the woman who sings "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Memorial Day parade. The mayor's son is the star of my son's basketball team.
 There's also a little bank in the center of town, where I've been making deposits and withdrawals for the past dozen years and where, when my children were little, the tellers would give them lollipops. It's a tiny building, across from the train station, done up in a Greek Revival style, with fake white pillars and red brick. 
 When I moved here in 1989, it was still actually called the Glen Ridge Savings and Loan Association, and I'm sure that's why we chose it. There was a larger bank across the street, which I believe was a Midlantic branch at the time. Later my bank became Collective, a name that always made me think of a Soviet farm. Then it became Summit, and last year it turned into Fleet.
The bank across the street is now a PNC.
I don't know any of the children of the bankers who run Fleet, or share pancakes with them in March. In fact, according to Fleet's Web site, the Boston-based company is seventh-largest financial holding company in the country, with assets of more than $200 billion and 20 million customers.
You could say that I'm pretty much just a 10-digit account to them.
In fact, you can't even call the local Fleet branch directly. You have to call a 1-800 number and get connected to an operator in Scranton, Pa., who in turn will route you back to the branch a half-mile away.
The transition from Summit to Fleet didn't go all that smoothly, at least at my branch. For some reason, there was a shortage of tellers, and every time you went, you'd have to wait 20 minutes in a long, cranky line. I'd look at all the shiny green Fleet propaganda and want to scream, "Hey guys! Fleet means fast!" (According to my Webster's, a second definition for the adjectival form of the word is transient, which is probably closer to the truth.)
But I didn't think about it much until one day in October, when I was taking a historical tour of the local cemetery and the docent showed us the tombstone of man who had founded the local trust company. Ah, a town banker, I thought wistfully. Like most people, I get such images from "It's a Wonderful Life" with Jimmy Stewart as the endearing savings and loan chief who restores confidence after the stock market crash by giving away his own honeymoon money. These days, the iconic banker would have to be Derek Jeter, the Yankees shortstop who flogs Fleets online banking service in TV commercials. In fact, Derek Jeter was right there at my local branch asking for toy donations for needy children at Christmas. Well, his picture was there, anyway. But I wouldn't bet on him handing out his honeymoon money in a crisis.
I called our town's unpaid historian, Sally Meyer, to learn a little about the person she had mentioned during the cemetery tour. It turned out to be Abijah Rittenhouse Brewer, the second mayor of Glen Ridge, who founded the Glen Ridge Trust Company in 1912. Mrs. Meyer works out of a one-room museum that is like a treasure chest, and she has files and old pictures of everything, including my house. She had a picture of Mr. Brewer and quotations from his 1917 obituary. He was a "quiet man, abhorring ostentation," the article said.
But, alas, it turned out that the bank Mr. Brewer founded was the one across the street from my bank.
Still, there was a file on my bank too, which was founded two years after Mr. Brewer's. On its 50th anniversary, in 1964, the Glen Ridge Savings and Loan Association sent a special magazine to all its . . . well, what they called "members" then.
On the back of the magazine was a rendering of a scroll, and printed on it was a creed. The creed was as old-fashioned and small-town as a Memorial Day parade -- and as remote as the sepia-toned pictures of my town when Mayor Brewer was still alive.
"Our association is a fellowship of human beings for human beings," the creed said. "We exist for the common man, for those who work, economize and save."

A New Plan to Revitalize Asbury Park Waterfront

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK 

 BODY:
A THRIVING vacation spot in the early- and mid-20th century, this city, with its mile-long oceanfront, has suffered from years of decline, shifting demographics and broken promises of renewal. But the latest in a string of plans has some officials hopeful that meaningful development might actually start next year.
 Ocean Front Acquisitions of Lakewood, which six months ago was named the redeveloper of a 56-acre wedge of waterfront land, is advancing a $1.25 billion plan for a waterside enclave of about 2,500 new town houses and condominiums as well as some 500 renovated units and 450,000 square feet of retail and entertainment space. There would also be recreational and open space, including public access to the shoreline, and some $30 million in infrastructure improvements, like sewage and utility connections. 
 Under the plan, which is still being completed and is expected to come to a city council vote in April, Ocean Front would divide the site into parcels, selling or leasing most to other builders to develop in phases over the next decade. A portion of the boardwalk has already been replaced and abandoned buildings have been demolished, paving the way for construction. 
Three separate neighborhoods, covering almost nine acres, totaling 744 units, priced from $200,000 to $400,000, could start by early in the summer of 2003, said Larry Fishman, chief operating officer of the company, a joint venture of M. D. Sass Municipal Partners and First New Jersey Real Property Management. Both have experience in refurbishing and marketing distressed properties in the state, including many in the last decade in the downtown district of Asbury Park.
After watching the checkered history of the city's waterfront from the sidelines for years, the partners decided to get involved because "we always thought it was a diamond in the rough," said Mr. Fishman as he gazed out the window of his boardwalk offices at the Atlantic Ocean. Though the difficulties of transforming Asbury Park are evident in the half-built condominium tower behind his office -- the legacy of an earlier failed development -- "circumstances came together to make a revival happen at this time," Mr. Fishman said.
In the last 18 months property values in this Monmouth County city have risen by roughly a third, to an estimated average of about $115,000, as an influx of house buyers have moved in to take advantage of very low prices for property at the seashore. The downtown business district, with little fanfare, has improved as existing stores have been renovated and new ones opened. And last summer, Mr. Fishman added, the political landscape changed when a new mayor and city council took office. 
In a city where politican strains and frequent turnover of officials has complicated redevelopment, there seems to be a sense that the new mayor and council are determined to move development ahead. Skeptics, however, warn that the current inexperienced council may not fare any better than previous officials.
MAYOR KEVIN G. SANDERS, a sixth-generation resident, remembers that the city had a a lively oceanfront when he was a teenager in the 1970's. It was frustrating to watch, he said, as the city's problems worsened and neighboring shore towns turned around. "We are committed to take back control of our own destiny," Mr. Sanders said.
In creating the current waterfront plan -- actually an amended version of an earlier one -- the city and the developer have tried to invite community input and to capitalize on the city's original 1873 design of open spaces, wide avenues, and streets that fan out at their ocean ends. The redevelopment is also aimed at providing sorely needed jobs and tax revenue.
The developer is paying $600,000 to $700,000 in annual taxes on the 15 acres it has so far acquired in the redevelopment area and put back on the tax rolls, according to city figures. And Mr. Fishman estimates that when the proposed new 3,000 housing units are completed, they will generate $12 million in new tax revenue. 
That would be sweet news for homeowners. "Let's face it, we have been paying the tax burden," said Sue Henderson, president of the Asbury Park Homeowners Association and a nine-year resident. As the city's economic base continues to erode, "we wait for the redevelopment" for relief, she said.
Last August the newly elected city council worked with Ocean Front Acquisitions to break the legal gridlock that had blocked the waterfront's redevelopment since 1992. That is when Carabetta Enterprises of Meriden, Conn., the previous developer, went bankrupt, derailing a plan for some 6,000 residences and igniting years of litigation.
Most of the legal disputes were settled when Ocean Front paid $7.5 million to buy the development rights to the beachfront from Carabetta and $6.5 million to the city for the tax liens on properties in the renewal area. With that money, Asbury Park closed a $4 million budget gap and ended the threat of a state takeover of its finances.
Still swirling over the city are a lawsuit on appeal by an earlier would-be developer in Federal District Court in Connecticut and rumors of an F.B.I. investigation of a previous city administration, which the agency's Newark office would not confirm. But neither of these matters, said James G. Aaron, the city special counsel and redevlopment lawyer, would "impede the current mayor and council from moving forward on the redevelopment of the waterfront."
The debate now is not whether the waterfront will be developed -- most of the city's 16,900 residents favor it -- but rather about how it will be developed. To be sure, community, civic and religious groups are advocating various causes, ranging from affordable housing and open space to the preservation of historic buildings. These sites include the Convention Hall and Casino, two timeworn Art Deco gems, as well as such more prosaic landmarks as the Palace Amusements building and the Stone Pony nightclub, where Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi performed. 
The developer and city officials said a significant difference in the process of presenting the current waterfront plan compared with earlier ones has been a determination to hold public sessions about the plan. The Miami-based firm of Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, nationally known for their "new urbanism" approach to design, has been hired by the city to come up with rules that are to be followed in implementing the design of the development, governing such matters as building heights, open space, the use of multiple architects and the integration of landmarks. The plan's lead architect is a joint venture of Clarke Caton Hintz of Trenton and Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn of Manhattan. 
Nonetheless, the plan has drawn criticism from some Asbury Park residents, who say that building so much market-rate housing on the waterfront will do little to ease the troubles in other neighborhoods and lead to the creation of a separate community.
"This is a market-driven, not a community-driven, plan that kowtows to outsiders," said Kerry Margaret Butch, executive director of the nonprofit Asbury Park Consortium, which promotes citizen participation in local decision making. "There should be more opportunities built in for jobs and affordable housing for the people who live here."
John J. Hamilton Jr., a councilman, said he would also like to see more affordable housing included to ensure that people who will be displaced have a place to go.
OTHERS counter that the city already has a disproportionate amount of such housing. Councilman John Loffredo said that with just 20 percent of the city's population homeowners, it needs to increase its homeownership rate. Still, he said, there are plans under way for the developer to build some affordable units elsewhere in the city or provide money to have them built. 
The waterfront, Mayor Sanders said, is not the city's only "economic engine." 
Proponents also say this plan is more realistic than previous ones because it breaks the area into smaller districts, including a retail-entertainment area, to be developed by multiple builders. Doing so allows for greater variety and increases the likelihood that the development can weather harsh economic times, the architects said. 
Mr. Aaron, the city's redevelopment lawyer, said safeguards are being put in place to prevent a repeat of the development stagnation of the last decade. They include arbitration clauses for speedy resolution between developers and the city and development timeframes. 
Many also acknowledge that Ocean Front has been the only developer willing to risk its own money on the redevelopment. Mr. Fishman said the partners had invested $21 million since last August, much of it without firm guarantees that the city would allow it to proceed. 
"Because we are not the builder," he said, "we will derive our profits from adding value to the land by having it zoned and approved and then parceling it out to other builders." The hope, Mr. Fishman added, "is to put a new face on Asbury Park and take it into the 21st century."

Staffing Companies Vote Against L.I.A. With Feet
 The Long Island Staffing Coalition Task Force says that at least 10 of its companies have not renewed their memberships in the Long Island Association in protest of the association's decision to form a company that would compete against them. The coalition was formed in August, after the L.I.A. said it would create a company called LIA Staffing. 
 "It seems that the L.I.A. is determined to use any means, including competing with its members, to achieve its goal of increasing its revenues," said Merrill Banks, the chief executive of Lloyd Staffing of Melville, a task force member.
Matthew T. Crosson, the president of the Long Island Association, said: "LIA Staffing is doing good things for the community, and the overwhelming majority of staffing companies recognize that and are working with us. It is unfortunate that a small minority of staffing companies do not see it that way."

Pall's Earnings Fall
The Pall Corporation (NYSE: PLL) of East Hills said Tuesday that sales and earnings were down for the second fiscal quarter ended Jan. 26. Sales totaled $285.4 million, compared with $340.7 million for the same period last year. Earnings were $18.4 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $29.9 million, or 24 cents a share, for the same quarter last year.
Eric Krasnoff, the company's chairman and chief executive, said, "The slump in the semiconductor sector, commercial aerospace and a generally weak U.S. economy caused the shortfall in sales and earnings." Pall manufactures filtration products for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, medical and aerospace industries. 

Around the Island
For Valentine's Day, 1-800-Flowers .com (Nasdaq: FLWS) of Westbury said that it set a company record with some 650,000 orders and six million separate visits to its Web site. . . . The National Association of Security Dealers in Washington said Wednesday that its regulatory arm had fined Schonfeld Securities of Jericho $15,000. The regulators contend that the company failed to maintain proper records for short-sale orders. The company has neither admitted nor denied the allegations; a spokeswoman said Wednesday that it was cooperating fully with the regulators. Compiled by Warren Strugatch

HEADLINE: EDUCATION; 
In the Districts, Costs + Cuts = Higher Taxes

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
CROTON-HARMON'S schools superintendent, Dr. Marjorie E. Castro, spent the recent winter school break working on a proposed 2002-2003 school budget that she feels her community can handle. 
 "This is the first time that we've been this late," Dr. Castro said last week, as she and her staff held meetings to prepare the budget to show to the community over the weekend. "We're all sharpening our pencils. We don't want to overburden the taxpayer, but with the flat increase in aid from the state, trying to do what state education asks us to do, and trying to strengthen the program with more and more kids in our system, a flat increase is like a cut." 
 Under the terms of Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed, no-growth budget, state aid to local school districts would effectively be frozen at last year's levels. The budget also proposes cuts in school construction aid. Building aid in the state has grown by $800 million to $1.4 billion since 1995 as school enrollments have risen. The proposed budget would cut the state's contribution for construction projects, approved by voters after July 1, with more districts receiving the minimum of 10 percent in building aid. 
Superintendents around the county are scrutinizing the numbers, looking for possible cuts, and steeling themselves to explain why proposed school tax rate increases are as high as 10 to 13 percent -- far higher than in recent memory. 
Taxpayers vote on the proposed budgets on May 21. Under the terms of recent state legislation, school boards must adopt a contingency budget when a proposed budget has been defeated twice by the voters. While teachers' salaries, transportation and extracurricular activities are considered ordinary expenses, items like new equipment and the public use of school buildings and grounds -- unless there is no cost to the district -- are not. 
"There are degrees of consternation," said David Ernst, director of communications and research for the New York State School Boards Association. "Districts that are generally wealthier are less dependent on state aid, and less hurt by the governor's no-growth budget. But coming off last year, when districts thought that the Legislature would come through -- and it didn't -- some districts had to go into their reserve funds. 
"If nothing additional were added to the arrays of programs, the Regents and the state comptroller have estimated that it would cost districts $1 billion; the governor has proposed $6 million in aid. This is one of the worst years. Some districts know austerity all too well, and others do not realize the implications."
In Rye, for example, where the proposed school budget tax rate increase is currently at 9.9 percent, Dr. Edward Shine, the superintendent, said: "The board is trying to keep the program together and keep costs down. In the past, we've had tax rate increases of 1.95 percent, or 2.38 percent. Last year, it was over 10 percent -- when you begin to string numbers like that, it is a manifestation of concern."
Most of the county's school districts, ever mindful of the complicated dance that goes on in Albany when it comes to budget matters, have practiced fiscal conservatism when making assumptions about just how much state aid to count on. For many of the wealthier communities, state aid has historically comprised such a low percentage of revenues that flat increases or cuts haven't had a substantial impact. And since in the past, legislators have overridden the governor's proposed budget for schools, and ended up giving them more money, some think the schools' reactions are premature. 
Still Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky said: "The governor's proposal is really a cut in building aid, which is much harder to reverse. If the governor's proposals become law, there will be problems."
The challenge is particularly difficult for districts where increasing enrollments add other pressures to school programs. In Irvington, where the district is probably looking at a double-digit tax rate increase, assistant superintendent of business, James Reese, said, "We're the fastest growing district south of Albany, with significant costs, and the state is not keeping up with that."
Even a so-called stand-still budget, one in which there are no increases in programming, carries with it significant fixed costs that would in most cases still carry at least a 5 percent tax rate increase. Contractual arrangements with faculty and staff, the costs of benefits and other obligations when combined with expanding enrollments and the increasing number of mandates and tests from the state -- make tax rate increases unavoidable. 
"Regretfully, we're proposing our third challenging budget," said Thomas M. Kelly, Valhalla's public schools superintendent. "We've been in double digits for the past two years. We're a Westchester school district where the community bears the burden. State education has upped the learning requirements, which is fine, but we don't get funding for it."
Given the uncertain economy, there is particular concern that school district residents will be especially reluctant to vote for double-digit tax rate increases. 
"We're all trying to get it down as low as we possibly can, while giving a quality education that the community can afford," said Dr. Castro, of Croton. "It's a tough go."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
A Korean Composer With Loyalty to a Bridgeport Home Base

BYLINE:  By BRIAN WISE 

 BODY:
ASK any American who follows contemporary classical music to identify recent Asian composers, and you are likely to hear Chinese names like Bright Sheng, Chen Yi or Tan Dun, composer of the Oscar-winning score to Ang Lee's film, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Yet while Chinese, and to a lesser extent, Japanese composers have established a major presence on the American music scene, Korean classical music remains less known.
 That prospect hardly fazes Jin Hi Kim, a 43-year-old Korean-born composer, instrumentalist and multimedia artist who lives in Bridgeport. Her works have been performed worldwide by the Kronos Quartet, the American Composers Orchestra and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Major institutions -- including the Smithsonian Institution, Asia Society and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington -- have collaborated with Ms. Kim over the past decade, as have avant-garde jazz artists like the saxophonist Oliver Lake, the guitarist Derek Bailey and the bassist William Parker. 
 Next Sunday at 3:00 p.m. at New York's Riverside Church, Ms. Kim's first orchestral composition "Eternal Rock" will be performed by the Riverside Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Helen Cha-Pyo. The work, which had its premiere last March at Carnegie Hall, features Ms. Kim as soloist performing on the komungo, a Korean fretted zither that dates to the fourth century.
"Acoustically her music is daring," said Gil Rose, artistic director of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, which plans to present the premiere of Ms. Kim's second orchestral piece next year. "It's not as westernized in that it doesn't use traditional melodies, but I think it has a lot of bite and impact and it's really visceral."
Ms. Kim maintains a high profile in her home base of Bridgeport. She and her partner, the composer and double-reed player Joseph Celli, settled in the city's Black Rock neighborhood during the early 1990's, attracted by its diverse population of Laotian, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Indian and Puerto Rican immigrants. In 1993, they co-founded the Korean Performing Arts Institute, later renamed International Performing Arts, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting non-Western art forms.
As artistic director of the group, Ms. Kim oversees its concert series and coordinates its research and advocacy programs. Operating on an annual budget of $250,000, the organization counts among its most visible initiatives the "Sounds of the World Concerts," a series that took place over the last three years, improbably, at the Harborview Market in Bridgeport.
"There aren't many auditoriums in this town, so we started a series in a grocery store," Ms. Kim said, laughing. The free, weekly concerts, which ended last fall, drew as many as 100 grocery-toting audience members every week. Ms. Kim said Bridgeport was an ideal laboratory to advocate Korean music alongside that of other cultures.
"There are so many immigrants here and their music is a wonderful vehicle for us to try and break down barriers," she said.
Mr. Celli offered a less rosy assessment of civic realities.
"Bridgeport offers a really challenging situation," he said. "It's the largest city in Connecticut and has very serious race, class and economic disparities. Our concert series are devoted to better understanding these cultures."
Ms. Kim can identify with the role of outsider. She grew up in Korea where, she said, traditional Korean music was largely rejected by the educational establishment in favor of Western classical music. Still, she earned a B.A. degree in Korean traditional music at Seoul National University before moving to the San Francisco area in 1980. With no money and little knowledge of English, she became immersed in the city's thriving contemporary music scene, studying with the composers Lou Harrison and Terry Riley, and receiving an M.F.A. from Mills College.
"The West Coast was a good place to be at the time," she recalled. "They were into Asian culture, and the San Francisco Bay area had a strong immigrant population."
Today, an outsider sensibility still permeates many of Ms. Kim's works for komungo, as its austere, elegant sonority is set against different sounds, instruments and styles. A telling example is "Eternal Rock," which was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra. Its premiere at Carnegie Hall was part of the orchestra's festival of immigrant composers in America.
Reviewing the work in The New York Times, Anne Midgette said the piece "moved through the orchestra like a curious outsider, wondering at the range of sounds it can make and generally using it as an extension of the twangy vocabulary of the solo komungo."
Unlike many other Asian composers, Ms. Kim's goals extend beyond merely fusing Eastern and Western musical traditions.
"After 10 years of combining traditional Korean and Western classical music, I realized there are more important things to do," she said, adding that she had shifted her style in the early 1990's. "I made a conscious decision to not only combine Korean and Western music, but a lot of other cultures."
This decision is reflected in her theater piece, "Dragon Bond Rite," presented in 1997 by the Korea Society and the Kennedy Center. The work incorporates a cast of mask dancers, percussionists and vocalists. Another example is "Dong Dong Touching the Moons," a multimedia piece that unites Korean and Indian musicians and dancers with video images and computer processing. It had its premiere at the Kitchen in New York in May 2000.
"As an experiment, it was very effective," said Elise Bernhardt, the Kitchen's executive director. "She was strategically very smart because a lot of people don't think about working in a theater, in that you need to bring in old expertise and new expertise."
In reviewing the piece, Jon Pareles of The Times said "Ms. Kim's austere music centered the work."
To many in the classical music world, the fusion of different cultures and media is creatively problematic, because one thing or another must be sacrificed in the process. Others argue that Asian music's status in the West will never be more than a fad. Michael Geller, the executive director of the American Composers Orchestra, said, "Asian music's popularity in the West has ebbed and flowed over the years, going all the way back to Debussy."
In December of last year, Ms. Kim received one of twelve $24,000 grants from the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, the New York-based institution created by the late conceptual composer John Cage and the artist Jasper Johns. 
Meanwhile, Ms. Kim said she remains dedicated to Connecticut. In January, her performing arts group announced that it will transform a former bank in downtown Bridgeport into a multicultural arts center that would hold 150 events, 500 classes and 25,000 visitors annually. The city is planning to buy the building and rent it to her group.
The center will include a performance space, gallery space, rehearsal spaces, classrooms and a cafe, she said. The group also plans to sublease space to other arts organizations.

Public Housing in Stamford Is Being Transformed

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN a project that is transforming a bleak Stamford neighborhood, the first 149-home phase of a $92 million redevelopment has been completed at the once-notorious Southfield Village housing project -- the initial step in the eventual replacement of 500 dilapidated units built in 1939. The redevelopment, under way since 1998, reflects current ideas of privatizing public housing and broadening its tenant base to include renters of market-rate units and buyers of homes, as well as extensive support services for residents. 
 Demolition has begun on another 11 buildings in Phase 2, with construction of 110 rental units to be completed in 2003. Phase 3, which is to be finished by 2005, is to have 56 rental units and 15 owner-occupied three-bedroom town houses with garages. 
 How the drug- and crime-infested warren near Exit 6 of Interstate 95 in downtown Stamford was changed into an attractive, diverse neighborhood renamed Southwood Square is a story about Hope VI, a nine-year-old program of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
While state and local funds for subsidized and low-cost housing continue to shrink, Hope VI has made 165 grants to private-public partnerships developing mixed-income communities in 98 cities. Its contribution to the reconstruction or replacement of substandard public housing has totaled $4.55 billion across the nation, the agency says.
Ultimately, Southwood Square's 24 acres will contain a total of 330 units: 160 low-income public housing units; 70 moderate-income units, with an income ceiling of $69,300 a year for a family of four; 85 market-rate rentals units; and 15 homes for sale.
"Mixed" is the operative word in this approach to the problem. Mixed income levels of tenants; mixed public and private financing; mixed types and sizes of apartments, town houses and single family homes; a mix of architectural details, building materials and colors; and a mix of rental and owned units are producing lively neighborhoods where ugly "projects" once stood in isolation and hopelessness.
As a result, the role of housing authorities is changing. "I think they are going to play a very different role," said Dannel P. Malloy, mayor of Stamford. "They were defined as bad managers overseeing unsuccessful housing. Now they will be seen as partners in all kinds of housing and making it work."
Under Hope VI's Homeowner Assistance Program, Stamford residents in public or assisted housing whose earnings do not exceed certain levels can enroll in a six-month training program in home ownership. Afterward, they will be linked with realtors and mortgage lenders who will assist them in finding and purchasing homes in lower Fairfield County. So far 30 households have signed up for the current training session, and $1.4 million of the Southwood Square development funds have been set aside for training and mortgages for 40 homes. 
"Hope VI," said Richard D. Fox, executive director of the Stamford Housing Authority, "represents a revolution in conventional public housing. Historically, it provided bricks and sticks, but this is an investment in people as well -- in vocational training, counseling, help in getting a driver's license, doing what's necessary to make a person ready for the marketplace. It has a social side that never existed before."
One of the social shifts is the integration of ethnically and racially diverse residents. "We don't keep track," said Vincent J. Tufo, development coordinator for the Housing Authority, "but we have a racial mix now that never was before. It had been all black and Hispanic. The subsidized units are still mostly black and Hispanic -- the others are white and black."
Darren Scott, who grew up in Fairfield, and his roommate, employees of a financial services company in White Plains, took a two-bedroom, two-bath market-rate apartment last December, four months after the complex opened. By Dec. 31, it was completely leased. 
Deciding factors were price, a pool and fitness center, fully equipped kitchens and laundry machines in each unit. "This is not much more than we paid for much less in Norwalk, and it's $500 to $1,000 a month less" than other market-rate apartments, he said.
A two-bedroom, two-bath market-rate apartment at Southwood Square rents for $1,900; the moderate income rent is $1,374 for a family of four that does not earn more than 60 percent of the Stamford-Norwalk area median income of $115,500. For a family earning about 20 percent of the median, the rent is 30 percent of the tenant's income. Unit sizes range from 650 square feet for a one-bedroom apartment with one bath to 1,650 square feet for a four-bedroom unit with two and a half baths.
For the developer, Beacon/Corcoran Jennison of Boston, "Hope VI has brought more developers into the field of creating mixed-income communities," said Peter Wood, the company's redevelopment director. Mr. Wood meets regularly with the Southwood Residents' Council's nine-member board to address concerns. Its president, Blondyne Mikel, attributes a sharp drop in crime in the area to Mayor Malloy. "He started putting more police here before redevelopment," she said, "and a police substation in 1998. We meet in his office on Mayor's Nights to discuss our situation. Now, troublesome residents seem to realize their behavior won't be tolerated."
A handsomely refurbished community center houses a health clinic, computer center, gym and fitness center, senior and day care centers, home ownership classes, youth activities and sports, and access to job training. Hope VI pays for most of it, with additional grants from the Housing Authority and United Way as well as GE Capital, Citibank and other corporations.
Twenty-eight residents, including three women, worked on the construction of Phase 1, and six of them are continuing to work in construction trades. Three men and two women have been trained in asbestos abatement and are working on the buildings that are being demolished in Phase 2. In addition, resident students baby-sit in the day care center. "My daughter Jennifer works there with small children," said Valerie Wallace. "She's 17, goes to Westhill High. It helped her immensely. Her self-esteem improved and so did her grades."
Mrs. Wallace, like many of the residents, grew up in the old Southfield Village and moved into the new apartments. "I'm loving it -- it's the best place I've ever lived," she said. "It had gotten bad here in the 80's, when crack was introduced into the community. The neighborhood was full of bars." She added, "There's still a lot of drug dealing, but the neighborhood seems to look cosmetically better."
While the Housing Authority retains ownership of the land on a 99-year lease-back to the developer, Beacon/Corcoran Jennison owns and will manage the buildings. Two well-regarded architectural firms were the designers: Herbert S. Newman & Partners of New Haven and Russell-Scott, Steedle & Capone Architects of Cambridge, Mass.
Financing of $92.4 million was assembled by the developer, which has 40 years to repay $16 million in mortgage debt from the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and 50 years to pay back loans of $10 million from the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development and $3 million from the City of Stamford. HUD supplied a grant of $26.4 million, and $37 million was raised from the syndication of federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits. During the three-phase construction period, the developer collects management fees and rents, but profits are capped at 10 and 12 percent by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and HUD, respectively. 
Beacon/Corcoran Jennison is working on two additional Hope VI transformations: one in Pittsburgh and the other, in New Haven, called the Homes at Monterey. When the latter was built in 1941, it was called Elm Haven and had 805 subsidized units in six high-rise and a few low-rise buildings. African-Americans and whites were housed separately. "Out of every three buildings, two were for blacks, one was for whites," said Robert Solomon, interim executive director of the New Haven Housing Authority. "It was considered progressive then."
The complex will eventually have 350 mixed-income apartments, single family homes and housing for the elderly. About half are finished and occupied. Apartment rents average $850 for families of four, and four-bedroom homes sell for around $70,000. The ultimate cost will be about $100 million. "We are applying for another Hope VI grant for 750 units in four complexes," Mr. Solomon said. "The apartments at Monterey are already oversubscribed, and the nine home ownership units sold very quickly."
Hope VI expires at the end of this year, but it is budgeted by HUD for renewal in 2003. A spokeswoman at HUD said, "It's up to Congress to decide."

Schools Scramble for Slices of the State Budget Pie

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
THE Irvington School District is bursting at the seams. With a growing enrollment, almost double the 1,080 students it had in 1990, there is a severe shortage of classroom space.
 "We now have 11 portable classrooms," said Vincent T. Beni, the district superintendent. "We look like a Florida retirement home." In 2000 the district began a $50 million project to build a new middle school and add a new wing, gymnasium and auditorium onto the high school. 
 Last year, the district learned that a change in the state budget would delay much of the state aid covering 18 percent of the project, forcing a hike in local taxes to raise several million dollars. 
"It was a major shock," said Mr. Beni, who described the hardships of relying on school aid that changes from year to year with the economic and political winds. "It's nerve-racking planning for education programs and not knowing where the money's coming from."
Mr. Beni has gotten parents to mount an intense lobbying campaign, drafting letters to elected officials, the governor and the state Education Department, for better financing. "They are getting more sophisticated and seeing how the lobbying and competition for school aid works," he said.
These days, he said, running a good school district involves not only educating students in the academics, but also giving parents a crash course in state politics, to mobilize them to help the district maximize its aid. 
Many districts across the county find themselves in situations similar to Irvington's. To handle soaring student enrollments, the districts took advantage of generous building-aid subsidies created in 1997 by Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature to encourage school construction. The districts approved bond acts to help finance their projects. But the state scaled back building aid last year, and much of the money was delayed to school districts. Now, many districts in mid-construction are in a financial bind and have no choice but to raise local taxes. 
And many districts are mobilizing parents, said Janet Walker, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association. As the political jousting in Albany begins heating up, fewer parents are sitting back waiting to see what their district will be allotted, Ms. Walker said. Instead, they are working to put pressure on elected officials to bring home the bacon. Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic state assemblyman from Newburgh, led a fierce political battle against severe cuts to suburban districts last year. He recalled recently that it was an extensive letter-writing campaign by local district superintendents and parents that helped persuade Governor Pataki to soften the cuts somewhat. 
The road is perhaps more rocky this year, he said, because the governor is again offering an austere school aid budget with no increases to building aid. 
"It would be a dagger in the heart of schools across the county," Mr. Brodsky said. 
Now is the time of year that Rick Freyman, in the Lakeland Central School District, calls March Madness. Mr. Freyman, assistant superintendent for business in the district, uses the term to describe the frustrating act of "trying to vote on a budget when nobody knows what the state aid is going to be."
The Lakeland district has had several projects under way since 1998, totaling about $40 million in costs. The budgets have all been affected by the building aid cuts. 
"It's horrible, but what can we do?" he said. "We have to pay our bonds back. When we get less in building aid revenue, we just have to raise the local school taxes higher."
Officials at the state Education Department said last week that it is simply too early to tell how suburban districts will fare in school aid allocations this year.
The allocation of school aid has long been the most contentious part of state budget negotiations. The state uses a byzantine formula, supplemented with ferocious back-room bargaining, to divvy money between the city, the suburbs and upstate regions. The city and suburbs vie ferociously for money, with each side accusing the other of depriving it of money. 
The state provides about 44 percent of the money to educate students in New York City schools. Most Westchester districts receive a far smaller percentage of their budgets from the state, so local taxes make up the bulk of school budgets. Traditionally, suburban lawmakers have accused the city of spending too little on its own schools and relying too heavily on state aid. This, they contend, deprives the suburbs of their fair share. City lawmakers say the suburban districts spend much more per student, and have plenty of money for larger classrooms and smaller class enrollments. 
The territorial disputes have intensified this year, school leaders say. Money is tight overall. After Sept. 11, the governor presented an austere budget, which is scheduled to be approved by April 1. 
In January 2001, the state Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, ruled that the state has long shortchanged city students and ordered the state to revamp its education financing system. The state is appealing the decision, effectively forestalling compliance, but in December, the Board of Regents proposed cutting school aid by 5 to 15 percent in some of the state's wealthiest districts and sending more money to poorer urban school systems.
"Every year it's a major tug of war," said Mr. Beni, Irvington's superintendent..

Fast Food? Not So Fast, Town Says

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLL 

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD 

 BODY:
CHICKEN and biscuits?
 No, stuff and nonsense, say a number of residents in this largely upscale village. 
 It seems Col. Harland Sanders wants to move into the neighborhood, but the southern gentleman is meeting opposition from some residents and local merchants.
Tricon Global Restaurants, the owners of the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise, want to build a fast-food emporium on the lot of an abandoned gas station at Yale Street and Springfield Avenue in the College Hill section that is one part quiet tree-lined residential and one part busy commercial strip. 
"We need new business in the area, but a fast-food chain doesn't help economic development," said Ron Carter, who lives down the street from the site. "It starts a slide, not a growth."
But Mayor Vic DeLuca said the restaurant would be good for the revitalization of the area, which in no way resembles the quaint and bustling downtown juust minutes away.
"This is not going to be your typical fast-food type building or business," said Mr. DeLuca.
He described the proposed building as a two-story affair with red awnings and cafe-style windows, but void of the traditional large signs and advertisements normally associated with fast-food places. It would also be home to a Chock Express, a coffee chain. And at the rear of the building will be a refrigeration unit, rather than the traditional dumping container. 
Not that fast food is anything new to Maplewood. There is already a Burger King, built in 1970, just two blocks from the proposed 78-seat KFC. But after residents complained that litter from the Burger King dotted the area and attracted rodents, officials adopted an ordinance in the late 1980's banning further fast-food restaurants.
Mr. DeLuca contends that the language of the ordinance is "bulky" and needs to be cleaned up, and he insists that the proposed KFC does not fit the definition of a fast-food restaurant as currently written.
To be sure, not all residents are opposed to the KFC.
"We as a town spent a lot of money and have done a lot of things to reactivate the area and to bring businesses in and to make the street something that will bring people back to the area," said George Berkeley, 52, who lives nearby. "Now when we have that coming to fruition people protest simply because it's a KFC."
While the proposal still has several more hurdles before being approved by the town council, Mr. DeLuca says that it will become a reality even though some residents and local merchants are gearing up for a fight.
On March 12, residents will have a chance to voice their concerns to the town council and to representatives of KFC. If the council approves the plan, then the company must still get the approval from various construction boards and address any environmental concerns before there is a groundbreaking.
"We always try to work with the community and the towns to make sure what we put in goes along with their regulations," said Michael Tirerney, a spokesman for KFC. "Maplewood is no exception."
Still, two doors from the proposed fast-food restaurant, Kurt Anthony, owner of the Avenue Bakery Cafe and Le Jardin restaurant, expressed his concern about his possible new neighbor.
"Everyone is entitled to make a buck, but for my little coffee shop it will mean the end," said Mr. Anthony. "How often do you hear of a franchise going out of business compared to an independent coffee place?"
Given that sentiment, it is not hard to figure out why a chalkboard sign hangs near the entrance to his cafe promoting a "KFC bashing party" on March 14."We have two bands, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and buttermilk biscuits," Mr. Anthony said. "We are also making a cake that will have an axe going through a KFC."
So far, Mr. Anthony said, he had received a big response from people who want to attend the party -- an affair whose proceeds will be donated to a local charity.
"I already have a ton of trash on my lawn from the Burger King," said one resident, who declined to be identified. "Now with the KFC it will be double the mess, double the rodents, and double the traffic. I can hardly wait."
The mayor says. however, that all of the concerns will be addressed and dealt with before final approval is granted. 
Beth MacDonald, executive director of the Springfield Avenue Partnership, a group dedicated to the rejuvenation of the area, is excited about the future of the two-mile commercial strip.
"This could be the first brand-new building to be erected in a long time," said Ms. MacDonald, "and I hope this will catch the eye of other developers and garner new interest in terms of getting new businesses onto the avenue."
She said she envisioned a strip lined with trees and lights to attract more people and provide a greater sense of community.
"With a few national stores to serve as anchors and a renewed interest in some locally owned retail stores, it will all be a reality," Ms. MacDonald said.
Not everybody shares her enthusiasm.
"Fast food brings people in and out and can cause traffic nightmares, said Carmine Petti, the owner of Realty 33 across the street from the site. "We'd be better off with a nice restaurant or something else in that spot."

ONCE upon a time, all you had to do was build a better mousetrap. Today, what supposedly counts is how well you market that mousetrap.
 Marketing gurus abound. When I typed in "marketing" at Amazon.com, 13,880 or so book titles sprang up. But it's a safe bet that few, if any, urge businesses to scare their customers into buying their products. Yet fear-based marketing seems to be all around us. 
 These days, after building a better mousetrap, you're likely to warn people that the use of no-name knock-offs may endanger the neighbors' children. After talking someone into buying the mousetrap, you'd better start saying how soon it could break, the better to sell an extended warranty. That is probably where the profit is anyway.
Fear is not a new sales tool. Protection rackets have been around as long as there have been thugs, and since Sept. 11, fear has altered spending habits. But even before the terrorist attacks, fear-based marketing had become mainstream, to our collective detriment. The economy of fear is now so pervasive that many people don't know they're living in it.
Consider bottled water, the fastest-growing sector of the beverage business. Americans spend billions of dollars each year on bottled water, even though it can cost thousands of times more than tap water. (Bottled water is often more expensive than gasoline.) Yet there is no particular evidence that it's safer than tap water. In fact, sometimes it is tap water. Roughly a quarter of the bottled water sold in this country comes from a city's or town's tap water -- although often further treated.
Like the collision-damage waivers pushed at car rental counters, bottled water is a form of insurance, one that is poorly regulated by marketplace and government alike. Selling obscure forms of insurance against little-understood risks can be lucrative, because the seller usually has far more information than the buyer. 
Perhaps the best example is the extended-warranty craze that has swept the consumer electronics and appliance businesses. Once confined to expensive products, these service contracts now seem available on almost anything that runs on power. After buying a computer recently at Best Buy, I declined the extended warranty. The sales clerk warned darkly that any attempt by me to upgrade the machine or even to open the mini-tower would void the manufacturer's warranty. For good measure, I was given a scary sheet listing the store's labor rates.
For retailers of low-margin goods like computers, extended warranties "account for a substantial chunk of the profits," said Paddy Padmanabhan, a marketing professor at the Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis. He never buys them, he added, because most such products either fail early, while under warranty, or last a long time. But the contracts are lucrative; an analysis by Consumer Reports indicated that they cost just 4 to 15 cents to service per dollar charged for coverage.
It's not just big corporations that make a living based on fear. Used-car dealers find it easier to sell extended warranties because people have so little faith in their wares. Organic farms benefit from the inchoate fear of pesticide residue in food. But "pesticides in foods are a very low risk," said David P. Ropeik, director of risk communications at the Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Fear prompts people to plan, and controlling risk makes possible a great deal of economic activity. But fear also paralyzes, and much of the economic activity that arises from fear-based marketing diverts resources from more productive uses. It can even produce worse risks. Antibacterial soaps and cleansers have flooded the market, enabling every consumer to wage a desultory war on germs -- only to allow the growth of more resistant varieties, according to research by Stuart B. Levy, a Tufts University medical professor and an expert in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Sooner or later, people are bound to wake up to the fact that it's more important to lose weight and to quit smoking than to worry about whether germs are on the kitchen counter, or if a VCR will someday need repair. When they do, the economy will be the better for it. Franklin D. Roosevelt said that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Maybe it's still true.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Rising Savings Could Mean A Weaker Recovery

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
AFTER a jagged descent lasting two decades, the personal savings rate of Americans may be moving in the other direction. Increased saving will help the economy to grow in the long run, but it could also dampen the recovery this year.
 Though Wall Street's big investment banks have not reached consensus, several of them predict a strong increase over the next two years in the share of Americans' disposable income that remains unspent. The change may have already begun: on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the savings rate for January was 1.8 percent, up from 1 percent in December. 
 Because spending stayed strong during the mild recession last year, most analysts never expected consumers to offer the economy much of a boost in the recovery. More saving would further weaken the rebound -- after all, the more you save, the less you consume.
"This is going to be an anemic recovery, and the increase in the saving rate is one key element as to why," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. The firm expects the savings rate to jump to 2.9 percent by 2003, from 1.6 percent last year.
The rate moved up briefly in the third quarter, to 3.8 percent, as consumers, in part responding to Sept. 11, took precautions for rough times. But in the fourth quarter, the savings rate averaged a measly 0.5 percent, near the norm for the last couple of years. From 1959, when the data were first recorded, through the early 1990's, the monthly savings rate had dipped below 5.5 percent only once -- a blip in April 1987. But the rate has not been above 5.5 percent since 1995.
Economists offer several explanations for the low savings rate in the 1990's, but first among them is the unprecedented bull market. "We had this huge stock market boom that was fueling a massive increase in household wealth," said Frederic S. Mishkin, a business professor at Columbia University. "When you're wealthier, you need to save less."
Even during that boom, Mr. Roach added, many mutual funds popular with individual investors underperformed the overall stock market. "Consumers who have left it up to their mutual fund managers to stash away money for their retirement period will be up for a rude awakening," he said. "When the stock market bubble popped, the only asset left to provide saving to the consumer was the home."
WITH privately held retirement wealth on the decline, the spotlight may shift to public retirement funds. Last month, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the Treasury would dip into the Social Security trust fund's surplus every year through 2009 to close its fiscal gap. If savers start to worry more about Social Security, they will share a motivation with their counterparts in Japan, where savings rates have been high for years.
"The Japanese personal saving rate is high because people are concerned about the inadequacy of government saving," said Fumio Hayashi, an economics professor at Tokyo University. "People save in case the government cannot deliver its promises." The surplus in Japan's social security fund, he explained, was not enough to pay for benefits owed to future retirees. The United States is heading down a similar road.
A surge in saving would offer workers some insurance against a less-than-luxurious retirement, but it would also offer the economy much-needed funds for investment in the long term. 
"There's an issue of the long run versus the short run," Professor Mishkin said. "When you're in a recession, what you'd like to have happening is the saving rate still staying low. But from a longer-run perspective, what we'd like to see is saving at a higher level."
Professor Mishkin noted that the low savings rate had not severely curtailed investment -- yet. "We've had to depend on the kindness of foreigners, and that can't go on forever," he said. " One of the things you would like to see is that household savings actually sustain the funds for investment."
Not everyone is expecting an increase in personal savings. "We are impressed with the resilience of the consumer, which has led us to be a little bit more open-minded about exactly how quickly the wealth effect is going to work its way through," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, which forecasts a savings rate of 1.4 percent for the next two years. 
The strong supply of credit to consumers could continue to make spending more attractive, Mr. McKelvey added. "There have been plenty of ways for consumers to get their hands on money if they've wanted to spend."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOHO -- BUZZ; 
South of Prada's Retail Palace, The Knockoffs Reign Supreme

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
THE SETTING -- The Avenue of the Counterfeit, five blocks south of the new $40 million Prada store at Broadway and Prince Street in SoHo. While platinum card holders glided around the sparkling interiors of Rem Koolhaas's so-called shopping epicenter, worshiping $400 sneakers and $1,000 purses in space-age dressing suites, the fashion-hungry crammed into jerry-built booths along Canal Street, thumbing their noses and scooping up illegally produced versions of the real thing.
 The Canal Street collection, which changes every couple of weeks, included a rich assortment of Prada fakes at a fraction of the price. (Prada officials were in Milan last week selling the real thing and were not available for comment.) 

THE BUZZ -- "You would never know the difference," said Michelle, a 28-year-old housewife from the Midwest who bought a knockoff Prada shoulder bag for $15 to replace the real Coach bag she was wearing. "If you could buy six for the price of one, why wouldn't you?"
Judging by lunchtime sales, black "Prada" purses were the chicest item last week, followed by $10 ski caps, $30 knapsacks and $70 sneakers with the trademark red stripe running up the sole. 
"I love Prada," said Flavia Belizer, a Brazilian student, as she rifled through the counterfeits. Beth Carline, an unemployed marketing executive from North Carolina, added, "When we go back to Charlotte, they won't know it's a knockoff."
A few booths also stocked knockoff Prada blouses, sunglasses and fishing hats. "This even says, 'Made in Italy,' " said Shirley Armstrong, a manicurist from Los Angeles, flipping her $10 hat inside out. "Does Prada even make something like this?" (Yes, since you ask, for $320.)
Others could care less about authenticity, as long as a label was affixed. 
"It's very important to get the stickers," said Stephanie Emmons of Chicago, who bought four no-name bags. Five minutes later, she re-emerged from the store with four "Kate Spade" purses, the glue still drying. "I call them bona fide fakes."
New Yorkers made for pickier shoppers. "They had Prada, but it didn't look real to me," said Ebony Rowell, a high school student from Harlem. 
For some, the distance between real Prada and fake Prada is no bigger than a runway. "It's how you wear it," said Darnell, a hair stylist from Long Island. "If you carry yourself head up, it will look real." DENNY LEE

It's All in the Training, Says an Owner of Guard Dogs

BYLINE:  By KURT OPPRECHT 

 BODY:
When people are insecure, they sometimes turn to a friend, or to man's best friend. But a dog is a lot more than just a friend, and a lot more than just a sentry. As the Whipple trial in Los Angeles makes clear, in the wrong circumstances, someone's faithful companion might be someone else's killer. 
 Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, who owned the two dogs that killed Diane Whipple outside her apartment in San Francisco last year, are on trial for involuntary manslaughter; Ms. Knoller has also been charged with second-degree murder. 
 Angelo Biondo, a dog trainer and owner of K9 Powerhouse Kennels in Park Slope, which trains guard dogs, says fatal maulings are the result of poor training. "A dog is an asset to a family," said Mr. Biondo, whose kennel also breeds pet dogs. "The fact that they're trained makes them 100 times better. I treat my dogs like they're family."
Mr. Biondo said there had been an increased interest in guard dogs since Sept. 11, adding that dogs are often the most economical security option, because one dog can be as intimidating as several human guards. In fact, K9 Kennels has rottweilers and German shepherds available for monthly rental, trained to attack on command.
But animal advocates question the need to breed and train dogs to be vicious. John Snyder, a director at the Humane Society of the United States, said barking was usually enough to deter criminals. "Do we really want dogs that bite to attack?" he asked.
The Humane Society does not oppose guard-dog training but does not promote using animals strictly for personal protection or renting them out.
"This is risky business," Mr. Snyder said. "If I take an attack dog home after receiving one or two days' training, and I give the wrong signal or the wrong command and don't know how to stop the dog, it's like starting a car and not knowing how to stop it."
But Mr. Biondo said K9 turned away people who sought a dog for the wrong reasons. "A woman came in last week who told me she was having trouble with a guy who was stalking her," he said. "I said, 'No, you don't need a dog, you need to call the police.' I wouldn't rent her a dog. No way."
The typical client, he said, is a contractor or a builder who wants a dog to patrol a construction site; it costs $950 to $1,250 a month to rent such a dog.
While he was building his house in Huguenot, Staten Island, Rick Assini rented Rex, a German shepherd, from Mr. Biondo. Mr. Assini said Rex worked out well, even though the initial training was brief. "I went down and I worked with them a couple of times, with Angelo and the dog," Mr. Assini said. "And he said, 'That's it, you're ready, take the dog.' "
Mr. Biondo's dogs are trained to follow specific commands, from "sit" and "stay" to "watch," "attack" and "release." "Nobody trains a dog to kill, except idiots and drug dealers," he said.
Mr. Snyder and Mr. Biondo agree that the Whipple death was an aberration, but animal advocates are pressing for a different attitude toward dog breeding and training. "There's been a lot of discussion and some research done on this," Mr. Snyder said, "and the problem is not getting better, it's getting worse." KURT OPPRECHT

HEADLINE: Tryin' Hard to Get Free, Via Rap on Your Own CD 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN 

 BODY:
WHEN Jason Wendell finds himself with a little extra cash -- not often these days -- he hops on the L train to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and heads to Dungeon Rock Studio to pursue his "double life." Mr. Wendell is recording an album.
 Mr. Wendell, a 25-year-old East Village resident, is not necessarily the type of person you would expect to find in a recording studio. He has a full-time job teaching English literature to 12th graders. He is not signed to any label, not even an obscure one. His producer, the owner of Dungeon Rock, A. J. Tissian, allows that Mr. Wendell "is not a world-class singer" and "has no idea what he's going to do with this project when it's done." Despite these complications, Mr. Wendell, who as an artist goes simply by Wendell, has spent nearly a third of his $31,000 teaching salary on his compact disc. 
 "This is the only thing I've ever done that is financially very absurd," Mr. Wendell said. "All of what I have goes to studio time. I'm living on microwave potatoes." 
Except perhaps for the part about the potatoes, he is in good company. Advances in recording-studio technology have made it possible for anyone with spare time, a few thousand dollars and a stage name to produce a professional-sounding CD. And to hear studio owners tell it, pretty much anyone is.
"It seems like everyone is doing it," said Steve Rosenthal, the owner of the Magic Shop, a SoHo studio. "The threshold of talent for making a CD is very low."
For lots of New Yorkers in their 20's and 30's, the vanity CD has become the cultural equivalent of the novel in the dresser drawer, a talisman against the workaday pressures to abandon one's creative dreams. For others, who more daringly walk the line between hope and delusion, self-financed CD's are lottery tickets -- the one thing that might deliver them pop-star status. 
"American culture is centered around entertainment," said Sean Grant, a 28-year-old floor trader on the American Stock Exchange who recently completed a self-financed rap CD under his stage name, the Storm. "Making a CD is one of the easiest ways to become a part of that."
At a time when CD's have never been easier to make, the market is flooded with products: the major labels released more than 6,400 albums last year. Yet album sales declined 5 percent. For dreamers producing their own CD's, the odds of commercial success have rarely been longer. At a company Christmas party last year, Mr. Grant performed his tune "Rock the Market," and fellow traders were so taken by the lyrics ("I buy and sell rappers like you every day/ Then I head to my club for a golf getaway") that they snatched up 200 copies of his CD, edging the Storm's debut effort toward profitability.
"All I need to do to break even is sell 400 CD's," Mr. Grant said. "I think I can do that over the course of my life."
The engine for proliferation of self-financed CD's is the digital audio workstation, a generic term for hardware and software that enable consumers and studio owners with low budgets to replicate on personal computers the complex, multilayered mastering techniques of a professional recording studio. 
The best known is Pro Tools. While a professional version can cost as much as $100,000, a simpler consumer version sells for around $1,000, plus the cost of a PC. To the basics, producers can add special-effects programs for little money. A program called Auto-Tune, which allows a producer to correct the pitch of a poorly sung note with a mouse click, costs $225.
While the technology is available to make a CD at home, most novices rent studio time and bring in an experienced producer. Mr. Wendell has found something of a guru in his producer, Mr. Tissian.
"When he has moments of nonbrilliance," Mr. Tissian said, "I can say: 'Wendell, stop. You're going to hurt yourself.' "
While garage bands of old sought gigs by shopping around simple -- some would say honest -- two- or four-track cassette recordings, slick, privately produced CD's can give a solo musician a full Boston Pops sound. According to Mr. Rosenthal, who is an owner of the Living Room, a Lower East Side club, many of the 30 to 40 amateur CD's submitted to his club each week "are seriously multitracked with a full band and backup singers."
"They got the whole thing happening," he said. 
Getting the whole thing to happen still costs money. Cheap studios rent for $20 an hour, and high-end studios from $250 to $350 an hour. While expensive studios have glass sound booths and blinking Starship Enterprise-style mixing consoles, low-end studios are often in apartments or lofts and consist of little more than microphones, a PC and a cigarette-stained rug for soundproofing.
"Every time I go in it's a grand," said Steve Blumenkranz, a fabric salesman and aspiring country music singer-songwriter from Queens who uses the stage names Stevie Blue or Stevie Elvis, depending on his mood. Though he estimates he has spent $40,000 on recording studio fees over the last eight years, he has yet to get lucky. "I need to get a break," he said.
For some, it's not a question of getting lucky, but of being unlucky. Michal Friedman, a Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter whose stage name is Michal the Girl, was walking to her temp job in Lower Manhattan last year when she was hit by debris from a collapsing scaffold. She promptly spent the $4,000 settlement from the scaffolding company on studio time.
For others, the hard part isn't finding money to get into a studio but finding enough to get out. With limitless special effects at their disposal, and the possibility of countless takes, some find it hard to stop working -- and spending. Mr. Wendell, for example, was unhappy with the sound of the drums on his CD. The remix cost him $3,000.
"It's like owning a boat or a dilapidated house," said Gregory Rogers, the owner of Rolling Ball Studios in Chelsea. "You keep putting money in, but it's never finished."
The beneficiaries of all this spending are studio owners. The recession and slowdown in travel to New York after Sept. 11 left many owners tending empty recording booths; for some, independent projects have been the difference between closing or staying in business.
"Since Sept. 11, I have not gotten one phone call from L.A., London or Japan about studio time," said Mr. Rosenthal of the Magic Shop. "That used to be 40 percent of my business." Before the attacks, he estimated, independently produced projects made up 20 percent of his business. "Now it's closer to 35," he said.
Will Schillinger, the owner of Pilot Recording Studios in Chelsea, said that while it was "sheer torture" to listen to some would-be artists, "the ones who come in and spend thousands on mediocre music, my feeling is, if they have the money to burn, more power to them."
Once musicians completed their CD's, they face perhaps the toughest challenge of all: figuring out what to do with them. The answer is not obvious.
Most major record labels won't open packages of unsolicited CD's, for fear that doing so would invite lawsuits from amateurs who think they hear a familiar melodic phrase in Garth Brooks's latest hit. Touring musicians can build support for CD's by selling them at shows. 
But musicians with day jobs have fewer choices. They can post their songs on Web sites like Mp3.com and hope the surfing public discovers them. A Portland, Ore., site called Cdbaby.com sells CD's of independent artists exclusively. Once they have CD's, many artists post their own promotional Web sites. But Tom Kenny, the editor of Mix magazine, which covers the recording business, said: "Getting noticed on the Internet is as difficult as getting noticed by a major label. It's a crowded, crowded market."
Mostly, self-produced musicians are forced to redefine success. They make do with smaller audiences and record sales in the hundreds rather than the hundreds of thousands.
Rachael Weitzman, 29, a daughter of the shoe designer Stuart Weitzman, estimates she has spent $100,000 making four albums under the name Rachael Sage. She defines success as "making the music I love, and communicating my music to other people." She added: "None of that precludes or describes major label success."
For a few absolutists, a deal with a major label is the only measure of success. These are the chronic optimists. After all, what is a vanity CD but a self-produced CD that hasn't been discovered -- yet?
Reached at home one recent evening, Mr. Blumenkranz -- the salesman who performs as Stevie Blue -- had just hung up with a Nashville producer who hadn't liked his CD. "He was anti-everything," Mr. Blumenkranz said. "He 100 percent dissed me."
It wasn't the first time. Mr. Blumenkranz is so accustomed to rejection that he has developed a mantra for getting over it quickly.
"For a few minutes I feel sad," he said. "Then I remember that I'm Stevie Blue. There's nothing stopping me. I have something to offer the world. I come out and shake my leg. And every time I do it people go nuts. And I'm writing these love songs that will break any girl's heart."

Ski Areas Rally, Yet Doubts Remain

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
EVEN before a flake fell at the nation's major ski resorts, the current season was shaping up as one of the most difficult in years, because of the weakening economy and the effects of Sept. 11.
 Though the worst fears of ski operators have not been realized, at least outside the snow-deprived Northeast, the three leading publicly traded ski companies -- American Skiing, Vail Resorts and Intrawest -- remain highly cyclical ventures in the eyes of some analysts, who regard them as best suited to short-term investing. 
 "It is usually a good time to own ski companies in the summer, when nobody is watching them, and to sell them at the end of the ski season, after the focus has gone," said Jason N. Ader, an analyst at Bear, Stearns.
This season was shaping up inauspiciously, with a soft economy, a strong dollar and a depressed travel market. 
"After Sept. 11, the picture was pretty much doom and gloom," said Chris Cox, a leisure-time analyst at Goldman, Sachs. 
Within days of the terrorist attacks, stock prices of the three ski companies dropped sharply. 
At Vail Resorts, executives estimated that, because of Sept. 11, the number of vacationing skiers, who generate significantly higher revenue for resort owners than day skiers, would fall by 15 percent. 
The companies cut costs and scrambled to make deals with airlines and hotels. Ample snow in the West has helped Vail Resorts and Intrawest, which own properties primarily west of the Mississippi River.
"Conditions are great in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and the rest of the West," Mr. Ader said. "There really hasn't been a meaningful slowdown." At the same time, analysts said publicity generated by the Winter Olympics has not led to a measurable increase in ski trips.
Record warmth in the East has hurt American Skiing, which had acquired properties at rich prices and was in financial jeopardy well before Sept. 11. 
"In order for people to come skiing in Vermont, there has to be snow on the ground in Manhattan," said Phelps B. Hoyt, a debt analyst at KDP Investment Advisors in Montpelier, Vt. "But last year the weather was great in the East, and it didn't have much of a beneficial impact on American Skiing's results." 
Under pressure from creditors, American Skiing has begun restructuring, including selling some assets. 
In September, the company sold its Sugarbush, Vt., property for $7.3 million. Last month, it said it had agreed to sell its Steamboat Resort in Colorado for $91.4 million. The company, which went public in 1997, bought Steamboat and the Heavenly Ski resort on the California-Nevada border that year for $288 million. 
American Skiing, which went public at $18 a share, traded at $1.05 on Sept. 10. The stock ended last week at 30 cents. At the end of October, the company had combined real estate and ski resort debt of $432 million. 
The company still has seven major properties, including Killington and Mount Snow in Vermont and Sunday River and Sugarloaf in Maine. 
Vail Resorts and Intrawest have fared better, largely through diversification. 
Last week, Vail reported a 42 percent increase in net income in the three months ended Jan. 31, to $22.9 million, despite a 6 percent drop in the number of skiers. 
That decline was offset by a 273 percent surge in real estate revenue, to $36.7 million, and an 8.6 percent increase in revenue from resorts, to $56.5 million.
In addition to its ski properties, which include Vail, Beaver Creek and Breckenridge in Colorado, Vail Resorts owns Rockresorts, which operates 11 hotels around the nation and the Grand Teton Lodge Company in Jackson Hole, Wyo. 
The company's stock slumped by about one-third after Sept. 11, to a low of $12.98, but it has bounced back. It closed at $18.74 on Friday. 
Intrawest, which has 11 properties including Whistler/Blackcomb in British Columbia, beat analysts' expectations for its second quarter, which ended on Dec. 31. 
On Feb. 20, Michelle S. Russo, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, wrote to clients that she expected Intrawest to break even in its current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and to generate $100 million to $150 million in free cash flow in its 2003 fiscal year. Ms. Russo has a buy rating on the stock and a 52-week target price of $20; it now trades at $16.41.
Intrawest, which closed on Sept. 10 at $18.42, fell as low as $12.58 after the attacks. 
Although the rise of snowboarding has brought more young people to the slopes, the industry still has to grapple with the demographic drag of the aging baby boomers. That problem, coupled with uncertainty about the weather, leaves analysts skeptical about whether these are stocks to own for the long term.
"Intrawest and Vail are the best companies in the business," Mr. Ader said. "But I find these stocks are much better trading vehicles than long-term investments."
Mr. Cox of Goldman, Sachs has a slightly different opinion. 
"There is a long-term component to these stocks, particularly for Intrawest, which has maintained a certain level of visitation by building real estate properties around a village," he said. "That reinforces itself."
But despite such diversification, Mr. Cox said investments in ski resorts "are going to be very seasonal."

A Pessimist Sees a Dark, but Profitable, Decade

BYLINE:  By The International Herald Tribune

 BODY:
MOST investors expect to make money when the stock market rises. Felix Zulauf, president of Zulauf Asset Management A.G. in Zug, Switzerland, says he is convinced that the market will decline over the next decade and expects to profit anyway.
 With his partners, Daniel Koeppel and Nicolas Mathys, Mr. Zulauf manages the Zulauf Europe Hedge fund, which can take short positions -- bets that stocks will decline -- and make other bets that stocks will rise. 
 Mr. Zulauf spoke recently about the future of the economy and the stock market. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. What is your overview on the economy and the stock market?

A. The consensus is that the United States economy has bottomed, is turning around, and the market hit a low on Sept. 11. That analysis puts us in a bull market that will carry over until next year.
I do not believe that. I do not think we are in an economic situation that allows for a sustainable recovery. Last year, there was a refinancing opportunity where interest rates were lowered and the consumer could cash out and spend. But long-term interest rates have risen, and therefore the window for lower interest rates is spent. Moreover, energy prices declined and left more money to spend for other goods and services. But energy prices are rising again. Thirdly, there was a tax cut last year that will not be repeated this year.
There will be a big disappointment as people realize the recovery is spent. The market is smelling it and selling off. I think by midyear the markets in the U.S. and Europe will be at new lows. There will be another big rally in the second half, then another decline. 

Q. How low do you see the stock market going?

A. I think we are in a structural bear market that will last for 5 to 10 years. It is not a nice picture. But it will not go straight down. From time to time there will be fiscal and monetary stimulus. Markets will get oversold and will rise for a while. Markets will zigzag downward. It will not be over until stocks trade at attractive valuation levels. Don't forget that the norm for the U.S. stock market over the past 80 years is a price-earnings ratio of about 15.

Q. What strategy do you suggest for investors in this market?

A. What is important for the investor is that the winning formula of buying and holding is not working anymore. In fact, it is working against him. If you cannot be successful in the current environment, get out. Leave it to those who can. This is a market for opportunistic investors who can play rallies and can also play the short side. But it is important to know what you are doing if you short stocks.

Q. What stocks is your fund shorting?

A. We see lots of losers. At present we are more short than long. For instance, we are short financial asset gatherers and managers because the bear market environment will slow their business sharply. Also insurance companies. These are companies that made money on their financial asset portfolios and now are suffering losses. You will see more and more disappointments in these sectors. Stocks are not the only problem. Corporate bond yields have actually gone up, and quality spreads have been widening. Many professional investors have moved to the higher yields. But we now have a corporate environment with the weakest balance sheets ever. It is like this in Europe also.
Remember, the 1990's was a period where companies bought back stock, and took out loans to do it, to boost the stock price. By contrast, in the past, when equity prices were high, people issued new stock and strengthened their balance sheets. These weak balance sheets are coming home to roost.
We are also shorting banks. We expect loan losses will continue to rise in commercial banking. Investment banking is hurting as the capacity built up during the boom time proves too big to support the very low revenue flow in the future. In general, we are also shorting any industrial company with a weak balance sheet and high valuation of its equities.

Q. What stocks are attractive to you on the long side?

A. Companies with low equity valuation, strong balance sheet and a dividend yield. One finds more like these among the midcap stocks, particularly in industries where there has been consolidation. That would mean basic industries. We also like metals and mining stocks, energy stocks and gold stocks. We are long Newmont Mining and Goldfields Ltd., a South African company listed over the counter.

Q. Do you expect high levels of inflation?

A. There are a number of crosscurrents at play. It is true that globalization has lowered some prices. So we have deflation in tradable manufactured goods. But the local service sector is inflationary. And credit creation has grown at an extremely high rate in the last decade and has produced inflation there. That is where we see a huge excess in our system.
The U.S. economic boom was created by a consumer spending boom interlinked with a financial asset boom. The financial asset boom was made possible by an aggressive easing of money, the accounting gimmicks we are beginning to see, and a lot of hype by the investment community. It came from the belief by the central bank that we were in a new age of productivity and innovation. 
For instance, when they measured the prices of computers, they saw that $1,000 bought a certain amount of computing power in 1998 and twice as much as 1999. But is that computer really half the price? 
At the end, it all has created the weakest balance sheets in U.S. corporate history. Weaker even than in 1929, and now the boom is over. 
Q. Will the prospect of inflation make real estate a good investment?

A. Real estate with a decent yield will do well. So will undervalued assets. But I would not go into financial districts or fat-cat houses in Greenwich, Conn. They are certainly overpriced.

Schools Extend a Hand to Middle-Class Parents

BYLINE:  By KATY McLAUGHLIN 

 BODY:
WHEN Rick Velleu and Joy Jacobson attended a fund-raiser last fall for the Nursery School at the Ethical Culture Society of Westchester, they didn't expect to receive any money. They had already put their son Jesse, now 5, through the private school for two years, paying $3,550 in annual tuition, and were about to enroll Leo, who is 3. But they learned that night that financial aid might be available for people like them.
 "I was very surprised to discover I could get aid," said Mr. Velleu, 40, an independent television producer earning about $100,000 a year. With his wife, who teaches physical therapy techniques, bringing in around $12,000, Mr. Velleu had always assumed that they were well over the qualifying income level. But they completed a financial aid application anyway and soon learned that they were eligible for an award that halved their payments for Leo's tuition. 
 "That money was a godsend," Mr. Velleu said. 
With the economy weak, even well-paid professionals have been scrutinizing the family budget. For many people with children in private elementary and secondary schools, tuition can be nearly as punishing as college costs. Yet many middle- and even upper-middle-class parents may not realize that "need-based" financial aid can sometimes apply to them.
In fact, many private schools, from preschools to high schools, have been trying over the last few years to help middle-class families, in part to help maintain socioeconomic balance, according to Mark Mitchell, a spokesman for the National Association of Independent Schools in Washington.
Cynthia Bing, chairwoman of the nonprofit School Advisory Service for the Parents League of New York, said, "It's not a good idea to have schools where the student body is just rich and poor, with no one in between." Economic imbalance, she added, has been a topic of concern for 20 years.
One way to address those concerns has been to revamp the calculations for financial aid. During the 2000-2001 school year, the association of independent schools changed how parental income is assessed in the needs analysis system used by the majority of independent schools. Among the changes, it reduced the way discretionary income is figured in the formula and placed a cap on the home equity that can be assessed as wealth. 
Assets do not weigh as heavily as income in the need calculation, Mr. Mitchell added, noting that they must exceed $75,000 before they even begin to affect parents' contributions.
MANY parents fear that they cannot afford private schools because of high tuition, which has been rising 4 percent to 7 percent a year, on average. According to the independent schools' group, the median tuition for students in the first grade of private school is $10,790; sixth grade, $12,156; and ninth grade, $14,178. 
Despite the cost, private school enrollment has been climbing, in part because of the rising population of school-aged children and because of many parents' perception that private schools provide a better education. A report released last summer by Public Agency, a research group in New York, found that 52 percent of the 1,200 adults it surveyed nationwide thought that the private schools were better than the public schools in their areas.
Six million students in kindergarten through high school, or more than one-tenth the total, attended private schools in 1999, the most recent year for which statistics are available, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That is an enrollment increase of 15.8 percent from 1989, it said. 
According to the center, about 60 percent of private nonsectarian schools offered some type of tuition reductions in 1999, and the National Association of Independent Schools says that 16 percent of students received some level of financial aid from those schools.
"We're trying to dispel the myth that financial aid is for people earning salaries in the low 20's," said James F. Ventre, the director of financial aid at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., which costs $26,900 a year. "In fact, we have an equal distribution of families getting financial aid across income bands," which includes those in the $120,000-to-$160,000 range.
The school does not necessarily consider a family ineligible for aid because it has valuable assets like a high-priced home, Mr. Ventre added. "In some cases," he said, "families opted to buy homes in expensive communities because they wanted access to the kinds of schools that would prepare children to come to our school." 
Kelye Modarelli, director of financial aid at Milton Academy, a 205-year-old boarding school in Milton, Mass., said she uses "the formula plus instinct" in deciding how to award aid. The school is advertising its aid program, emphasizing that each family's financial picture will be judged individually, she added.
Ms. Modarelli said she considers factors like place of residence and family size. People who live in Manhattan, for instance, have higher-than-average expenses, as do families with several school-aged children. A family earning as much as $200,000 a year, therefore, might qualify for aid, she said.
Milton also has an emergency fund for parents whose financial status changes during their children's enrollment.
"We have had parents, in the technology sector especially, who've lost their jobs in the past year; they contacted us and we repackaged their aid," Ms. Modarelli said. She added that she used $90,000 for such cases during the 2000-2001 school year.
Not all middle-class families, though, are comfortable with the idea of receiving financial assistance. A few private schools, like Lick-Wilmerding High School in San Francisco, have adopted indexed or flexible tuition plans that avoid the distribution of direct financial aid.
Albert Adams, the headmaster, noted that the school had been tuition-free for 77 years, until 1988, thanks to a substantial endowment that ran out. Soon after the change, he recalled, he met with parents to discuss the new tuition and financial aid program. A father stood up and told him he would rather take his child out of the school than receive financial aid.
"He was a self-made man for whom financial aid was humiliating," he said. "Right there, I realized we would have to change the language of discourse so as to not lose the middle class."
The school adopted a flexible tuition program that assigns a sliding scale of tuition based on parental need. Annual tuition ranges from $600 to $19,009; a family of four, with two children at Lick-Wilmerding, annual income of $107,000 and net assets of $163,000, would pay around $4,100 a year per child.
While many middle-class families are undoubtedly applauding some of the recent changes in financial aid, some critics have expressed concern about how they might affect poorer families.
"Oh, you bet there's disagreement -- there's debate, there's discussion" within independent schools, Mr. Mitchell of the association of independent schools said. "You're talking about a limited pool of funds and schools having to make hard choices about who gets it."
Jacqueline Y. Pelzer, the executive director of Early Steps, a nonprofit group in New York that helps minority families apply for admission and financial aid at private schools, agrees with the movement toward economic diversity. "Many families of color in the middle-income ranges stay away from independent schools because they are not aware of the aid availability," she said. She said it was important to have minority students from all economic backgrounds, but she added, "if the day ever comes when fewer kids of color are able to attend because aid is being diverted away from them in favor of socioeconomic diversity, I'll change my opinion."
John McGarry, director of financial aid at Concord Academy in Concord, Mass., says independent schools like his have been trying to achieve diversity but are still criticized as exclusive or unfair. Forty-four percent of the families in his financial aid pool earn more than $51,000 a year, Mr. McGarry said.
But he said that only 19 percent of the families at Concord receive any financial aid, a proportion not uncommon at other private schools; the remainder pay $22,800 annually for day school, or $29,200 including board.
David Anderson, a financial planner at the Baron Financial Group in Fair Lawn, N.J., said that with proper planning, many middle-class parents could afford tuition that appeared prohibitive at first glance. That planning, he said, should consider financial aid grants as well as loans and education savings accounts.
AS for Mr. Velleu and Ms. Jacobson, once their younger son finishes preschool, he will join his brother in one of the local public schools that motivated the family to move to Westchester County in the first place. With tuition concerns on the back burner for now, Mr. Velleu says he can concentrate on the next task -- figuring out how to finance two college educations. The aid he received from his sons' preschool, however, helps assuage some of his worries.
"I feel no stigma whatsoever asking for financial aid," he said. "If it's available and we qualify, then we're thrilled to get it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Lisa Black; 
TIAA-CREF Bond Plus Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
CLEAR financial statements are so important to Lisa Black, who runs the $295 million TIAA-CREF Bond Plus fund, that she unloaded the fund's Enron bonds soon after she bought them in 1999.
 "We couldn't understand their accounting," Ms. Black said. Few investors did, but many held onto the company's stock and bonds until Enron's spectacular financial difficulties last fall. 
 While she keeps a focus on financial statements, Ms. Black, who is based in Manhattan, is also paying special attention these days to bond issuers' access to the credit markets. "Now, any company that has questions about its accounting or does financial-statement shenanigans will have difficulty tapping the credit markets," she said.
The fund returned 7.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 6 percent for its peer group of intermediate-term bond funds, according to Morningstar Inc. It returned 7.5 percent in the last 12 months, versus 6.1 percent for the group.
Ms. Black, 42, invests at least 75 percent of the fund's assets in investment-grade corporate bonds as well as in United States Treasury, agency and mortgage-backed securities. The balance can be invested in illiquid bonds or in high-yield, or junk, bonds -- those rated below investment grade. Junk bonds, however, cannot exceed 15 percent of assets.
Currently, the fund has just a 1 percent stake in junk bonds, but Ms. Black is considering buying more. "Historically, below-investment-grade bonds tend to outperform higher-quality credits as the economic environment improves," she said, partly because issuers of junk bonds are typically highly leveraged and their debt burden decreases as business grows.
The recovering economy has also prompted her to raise her stake in corporate bonds, particularly in the auto industry.
She has increased her holdings of mortgage-backed securities because she expects a diminished supply in 2002. A wave of refinancing by homeowners has declined as mortgage rates have inched upward, she said.
Over all, the fund's roughly 150 bonds have an average yield to maturity of 5.7 percent, versus 5.5 percent for the Lehman index. 
The fund's turnover rate last year was 234 percent, compared with 174 percent, on average, for its group, according to Morningstar. Ms. Black tends to buy and sell bonds quickly, she said, to take advantage of opportunities in new corporate issues. The fund's annual expenses totaled just 0.3 percent last year, compared with 1 percent for its group, Morningstar said.
About 4 percent of the fund is invested in Treasury inflation-protected securities, called TIPS. The 10-year bond maturing in January 2007 has a composite yield of about 5.25 percent, which includes an inflation adjustment of 2.4 percentage points, she said.
Ms. Black bought this issue of TIPS from last November through January of this year. She believes that inflation will rise and that the bonds will increase in value. 
Looking at automakers' bonds, Ms. Black likes the 6.875 percent bonds due September 2011 issued by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. She bought the new issue in September at $99.699 for each $100 in face value; on Friday, they closed at $98.954. The bonds are rated BBB+, toward the lower end of investment grade, by Standard & Poor's.
"People worry that the zero percent financing will create weaker auto sales," she said, but the extra yield over Treasuries "more than compensates for what would be even flat sales in 2002." 
In January 2001, Ms. Black bought 6.45 percent bonds due February 2011 and issued by Wells Fargo, the big bank based in San Francisco. Standard & Poor's rates the issue A+. She paid $99.653 for the bonds; they closed at $103.152 on Friday. Banks benefited as the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates last year, Ms. Black said. "And they don't have the issues they had in the early 90's," she added, "when they had huge exposure to commercial real estate or Latin America."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
The Happy Talk Is Still Flowing From Wall Street

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
A CLAQUE of Wall Street analysts who were rah-rah for Enron not long ago ventured from New York to Capitol Hill last week to educate the nation's lawmakers about the way they do their jobs. Those investigating the Enron collapse learned that analysts plumbing the financials of companies whose future securities offerings their firms hope to underwrite often do their best work with their eyes closed and their ears plugged. 
 A thinking person might expect that, under the spotlight, brokerage firm analysts might be a bit more circumspect about making wildly bullish pronouncements about companies that could benefit themselves or their firms. But a thinking person would be wrong. This is Wall Street. 
 Consider the Feb. 26 writings of Holly Becker, new media/e-commerce analyst at Lehman Brothers, about Alloy Inc., a direct marketer and media company in New York. Ms. Becker initiated coverage of Alloy with a buy rating just over three weeks after Lehman managed an offering of 6.2 million of its shares. She assigned the stock a price target of $26. The stock closed on Friday at $15.94. 
Alloy sells mountain bikes and skateboards to boys and apparel and accessories to girls through Web sites and catalogs. It also publishes AlloyGirl magazine and Strength magazine, aimed at teenage boys. Its shares are down 26 percent this year, but Alloy is still hot. The company's $620 million market value is more than 3.5 times its sales last year.
Alloy has yet to turn a profit, but a reader of Ms. Becker's report might not realize this. Here is one of the reasons she gives to buy the shares: "Alloy's proven profitable business model and high-growth potential should bring further upside to the shares."
But according to the offering statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, Alloy has incurred nothing but losses since its inception six years ago -- $76.7 million, to be exact. The company did generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, in the most recent quarter, but that measure is not what most investors consider a "profitable business model." 
Another reason to buy the stock, Ms. Becker said, is its impressive performance since it went public in June 1999 -- up 15 percent, versus a decline of 17 percent in the overall market. Oddly, Ms. Becker argued that the performance "illustrates Alloy's ability to weather the poor economic environment." Enron had a top-performing stock. Did that illustrate its ability to weather storms? 
Alloy's valuation is attractive, Ms. Becker opined, because the shares are trading at just over two times her estimated revenue for the company. The price target of $26 is a result of her estimated cash flows at the company over the next five years. 
Ms. Becker did not return a phone call to discuss her Alloy report, which contains several interesting disclosures. In addition to underwriting the recent offering, Lehman makes a market in Alloy's securities, and an analyst who contributed to the report (or a member of his or her household) owns shares in it.
While Ms. Becker prattles, Jonathan H. Cohen, portfolio manager at JHC Capital in Greenwich, Conn., and former chief of software and Internet research at Merrill Lynch, provided some analysis. "Alloy has grown largely through acquisitions," he said. "Its stated strategy is to pay 11 or 12 times trailing Ebitda for the companies it buys. Yet Alloy's shares trade at 134 times Lehman's Ebitda estimate for the year ending January 2002. I have a hard time coming to terms with that discrepancy."

 CORRECTION:
The Market Watch column last Sunday, about a bullish report by Lehman Brothers on the stock of Alloy Inc., a direct marketer and media company, misstated the report's description of the relationship between Lehman and Alloy. The report said that Lehman underwrote Alloy shares recently; it did not say that any analyst who contributed to the report, or any member of such an analyst's household, owned Alloy stock.

HEADLINE: The Rise And Fall Of Global Dreams 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
GARY WINNICK knew it was a dinner fit for a king when one showed up. Constantine of Greece was among the 240 luminaries who dined on tournedos of Aberdeen Angus that November evening in 1999 at Claridge's Hotel in London.
 The elaborate event, paid for by Global Crossing, the communications company founded by Mr. Winnick, included a stirring speech on the role of a late-20th-century superpower by William S. Cohen, then the United States secretary of defense, who had flown 16 hours from Chile to dine with Mr. Winnick and his guests. 
 Celebrated by such figures and buoyed by Global Crossing's soaring stock, Mr. Winnick, a recently minted billionaire, seemed to have the world in his palm. Who would have guessed that a kid from Roslyn, N.Y., would one day rub shoulders with Margaret Thatcher? "One little idea," he once marveled to associates, "and look what's happened to me." 
He may no longer want the attention.
In the last month, Global Crossing has collapsed and Mr. Winnick -- its chairman -- has troubles aplenty. His reputation has been shattered and his dream of operating a worldwide fiber optic network is in tatters. The fortune he amassed before Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy protection in late January has elicited a chorus of criticism from shareholders who have seen their investments in the company disappear.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating Global Crossing's dubious accounting. Employees, investors and corporate governance experts have blasted Mr. Winnick's management of the company. "He was the chairman and did not run the company," Mr. Winnick's spokesman responded. "The chief executive does."
Mr. Winnick has some supporters. Stephen F. Bollenbach, the chief executive of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, called Mr. Winnick "a good guy." Arnold Kopelson, a Hollywood producer, cited his generosity and his warmth.Others say they have enjoyed working with him. 
STILL, he has many detractors. Some have criticized a style that associates describe as volatile and arrogant. Others point out that a large chunk of the $734 million he realized from Global Crossing stock came from share sales that occurred after the company's troubles became clear.
Perhaps no one should have been surprised by his fall. To hear many of Mr. Winnick's associates tell it, excess and controversy have periodically played roles in his career since his days at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the failed investment bank famed as the home of Michael R. Milken.
As head of the convertible bond desk in the Los Angeles office of Drexel, where Mr. Milken ruled as the king of junk bonds, Mr. Winnick developed a reputation for being condescending and showy. He was the kind of guy who "bragged about his trades," said one co-worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
A spokesman for Mr. Winnick denied the portrayal.
Mr. Winnick, who is 54, left Drexel in 1985, but controversy followed him. In 1989, he received immunity after agreeing to testify against Mr. Milken, who served time in prison for securities and reporting violations. Mr. Milken, through his spokesman, declined to comment. A spokesman said Mr. Winnick had never testified against Mr. Milken.
As his affluence grew, Mr. Winnick rarely shied away from self-promotion or ostentatious displays of wealth, former associates say. He owns a palatial estate in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles said to be worth $94 million. He has a luxurious office in Beverly Hills. His fortune has given him access to several rarefied power circles in Los Angeles and Washington. Both former President George H. W. Bush and the Democratic fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe reaped small fortunes from Global Crossing stock holdings.
"My new best friend is David Rockefeller," one associate remembers Mr. Winnick saying after agreeing two years ago to donate $5 million to the Museum of Modern Art, where Mr. Rockefeller is chairman emeritus.
Before Global Crossing's decline, Mr. Winnick showered his beneficence on friends like Lodwrick Cook, the co-chairman of Global Crossing (Mr. Winnick's own title is chairman, not co-chairman) and a former chief executive of the Atlantic Richfield Company, who received a Rolls-Royce from Mr. Winnick as a personal gift. Even critics say he is extremely charitable.
Mr. Winnick's beginnings were modest. He boasts of having arranged his marriage for Christmas Eve of 1972 at the Swan Club, a catering hall near Roslyn, in part because its Christmas tree and tinsel saved him money on decorations. After graduating with a business degree from Long Island University, he took a job selling restaurant equipment.
He quickly went to Wall Street as a trainee at Burnham & Company, a precursor to Drexel. But Mr. Winnick was never considered a star at Drexel, according to former executives who worked with him there.
While a salesman in Drexel's Manhattan office, Mr. Winnick was supposedly scandalized to learn that Mr. Milken, when the two men were colleagues, had charged clients much more than he had for the same work. He took the matter up with Mr. Milken's boss but nothing came of it, according to a passage in "Den of Thieves," the 1991 book about Drexel by James B. Stewart. 
Mr. Milken ultimately became Mr. Winnick's boss, and Mr. Winnick abruptly left Drexel in 1985. A spokesman for Mr. Winnick said he left to start his own business, but former colleagues of the two men say they still believe a blow-up preceded the departure. Mr. Milken's spokesman declined to comment.
In any case, Drexel helped finance Mr. Winnick's first independent venture, Pacific Asset Holdings, which eventually evolved into the Pacific Capital Group.
In the 12 years that Mr. Winnick ran the privately held Pacific, its investments produced mixed results. Pacific bought RB Furniture in 1988 for $53 million. The same year, it sold a 35 percent interest to a former Drexel client, the First Executive Corporation, in exchange for $53.5 million in junk bonds, and the rest to other investors for a slight profit, a spokesman for Mr. Winnick said. Two years later, the company filed for involuntary bankruptcy.
Also in 1988, Pacific acquired Ortho Mattress Inc., then the nation's largest factory-direct bedding merchant. Ortho filed for bankruptcy three years later, after Mr. Winnick had sold his interest in the company, but his spokesman declined to say how he fared.
By 1997, the year Mr. Winnick founded Global Crossing with three associates, he had scored at least one success when Pacific Capital sold its controlling stake in OpTel Inc., which provides satellite TV services to apartment buildings, to Le Group Videotron for $100 million. His company had invested $12 million.
Some deals have yet to pay off financially but have helped expand Mr. Winnick's web of influence and investors. In 1996, for example, Pacific joined with the real estate departments of Morgan Stanley and Goldman, Sachs, as well as Union Labor Life Insurance, to buy Playa Vista, a West Los Angeles real estate development. Though DreamWorks SKG, the entertainment company owned by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, had once planned a major development there, it never got off the ground.
But Mr. Winnick's deals were about to become less relevant. Pacific Capital grew interested in Atlantic Crossing, a small telecommunications effort that was planning to lay fiber optic cable under the Atlantic Ocean to carry the increasing volume of Internet traffic.
Gathering investors for the venture, Mr. Winnick tapped Union Labor Life Insurance and called on former Drexel associates who had become executives at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Canadian Imperial's initial $31 million investment, which was coordinated by Dean C. Kehler, Andrew R. Heyer and Jay R. Bloom, eventually generated more then $2 billion for the bank. Analysts say each of those men made a small fortune from investments in Global Crossing.
IN August 1998, Global Crossing went public at $12.75 a share, and in February 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst, its stock closed at a high of $61.8125 a share.
In the interim, not only did Mr. Winnick become wealthy, but so did many people close to him, including his housekeeper and a friend, the architect Charles Gwathmey.
If Mr. Winnick was impulsively generous to his friends, he was also an impulsive and some say difficult manager, who would call meetings while he worked on his treadmill and routinely dismiss managers.
Lacking experience in operations, he hired and then dismissed four chief executives in four years, offering each of them lucrative signing deals and often giving them lucrative separation agreements. Two former chief executives still have strong ties to Global Crossing. Thomas Casey is a member of its board and John Scanlon is chief executive of Asia Global Crossing, its main subsidiary.
Mr. Winnick's personal extravagance set the tone for what several former employees say was undisciplined and reckless spending at Global Crossing. The most obvious outlays went for offices and corporate planes. One former executive recalled that the company leased elegant offices in one of the better office parks in Madison, N.J., shortly after Robert Annunziata joined the company. Mr. Annunziata, based in New Jersey, did not move to Beverly Hills; he served as chief executive from February 1999 to March 2000.
After Global Crossing paid $3.4 billion for IXNet in February 2000, IXNet's founder, David Walsh, was named president and then co-chief operating officer of Global Crossing. Even though Global Crossing's stock was beginning its ominous descent, the company undertook an extravagant renovation of its office space at 88 Pine Street in Manhattan.
It installed, for example, a custom-made lighting system to emulate fiber optic strands with neon lighting, one former employee recalled. Several former employees say they thought Mr. Walsh had a decorator working almost all the time, redesigning two floors. One recalled that Mr. Walsh put in a staircase linking the 29th and 30th floors, then had it changed at a cost he believed exceeded $250,000. A company spokeswoman said the work was started before the purchase of IXNet.
Even last year, as the stock plummeted, the company continued to operate five jets. Those included a Boeing 737, a Challenger, a Gulfstream, an Astra and another plane, a seven-seater. "The company did not need more than one or two planes," one former executive said. Now, according to the spokeswoman, it leases two planes.
A lack of discipline extended beyond offices and planes, according to at least three former Global Crossing employees.
One said the company spent money needlessly for software systems. For example, in early 2000, Global Crossing decided to buy software made by SAP, the German company, for accounting and human resources management, according to a former Global Crossing executive.
This person recalled that several Global Crossing executives were told that it would cost the company at least $150 million for the systems, and that Global Crossing did not need to buy them because it already had adequate accounting and human resources software.
The company ordered the software anyway, although it was never fully installed, this person said. When installation efforts stalled, Global Crossing's executive vice president for finance, Joseph Perrone, who had been at Arthur Andersen before joining Global Crossing, hired Andersen's consulting unit to examine the problem. The company spokeswoman said it eventually installed the software but gave no date.
One former employee of the Frontier Corporation, which Global Crossing acquired in 1999, was surprised to learn after the merger that Global never had product profitability measures. They track whether individual products are making money and allow companies to decide whether to continue selling certain products, withdraw them from the market or modify them.
At one meeting with Mr. Perrone to discuss the importance of such measurements, "he didn't want to put them in," this person recalled. "He said, 'They are way too complicated.' " The company spokeswoman declined to comment.
By the middle of last year, these problems were minor irritations compared with the threat facing Global Crossing -- an overwhelming glut of communications capacity industrywide. So Mr. Winnick began a search for investors willing to inject cash into his ailing company.
Mr. Winnick found an ally in this search in Steven J. Green, who had stepped down as United States ambassador to Singapore in February 2001. Mr. Winnick had met Mr. Green nearly 20 years earlier, through Leon Black, another associate from Mr. Winnick's days at Drexel.
With Mr. Green's help, Mr. Winnick cemented contacts with Singapore Technologies Telemedia, a communications company controlled by the Singapore government. Mr. Green and Mr. Winnick also invested in K1 Ventures, a Singapore-based investment firm controlled by Singapore Technologies' parent company, just as Global Crossing's decline was accelerating last year.
MR. WINNICK also lured Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, to invest in Global Crossing. Mr. Winnick has referred to Mr. Li as L.K. to show how close the two are, a former associate of Mr. Winnick said.
By the time Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies formally agreed to invest in Global Crossing, however, it was too late for Mr. Winnick to retain control. They agreed to buy it out of bankruptcy for $750 million, a fraction of its listed asset value of $22.5 billion, but the possible success of the bid is unclear.
Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing wiped out Mr. Winnick's own stake in the company, eliminating much of his influence over operations. He is still chairman, but it is unclear whether Global Crossing's new owners will want him to remain connected to the company.
Some investors think this point may be moot if Global Crossing is forced into liquidation and its assets auctioned, a possibility that grows stronger with each day that passes without an offer to rival that of the Asian companies.

HEADLINE: A Rebound, Yes, but the Price May Be High 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
JUDGING from its recent financial results, Eckerd, the big drugstore chain owned by J. C. Penney, is going strong. J. Wayne Harris, Eckerd's relatively new chief executive, was hired to turn it around, and he appears to have done the job.
 But from another vantage point, Eckerd has hit some nasty bumps. At least two states are investigating the chain for possible overbilling in its pharmacies, and it is the subject of a class-action suit contending that the company routinely charged customers for medications they did not receive. In Texas, an insurance company sued Eckerd last November, contending that it overbilled for medications in workers' compensation claims. 
 Mr. Harris, it also turns out, has a troubled past. He was dismissed from his previous job as chief executive of the Grand Union Company, the grocery chain, in February 2000. According to two people with knowledge of the situation at Grand Union, the company under Mr. Harris made questionable deals with suppliers and its distributor that bolstered the company's immediate financial results but that harmed it long term. Grand Union filed for bankruptcy protection eight months after Mr. Harris left. 
Allen Questrom, the chief executive of J.C. Penney who hired Mr. Harris, said that two of Mr. Harris's previous employers had given him rave reviews and that questions about his performance at Grand Union were irrelevant. "Wayne has worked for us for a year and a half and I have nothing but outstanding reviews for him from within this company and my experience with him," he said. 
But the complaints about Eckerd are not easy to dismiss, and they have human dimensions as well. A retired North Carolina couple, for example, contend that Eckerd switched their prescriptions without their knowledge or approval.
Mr. Harris was hired to restart Eckerd's engines in late 2000. Just as Mr. Questrom has wowed Wall Street with his turnaround at Penney, Mr. Harris has transformed Eckerd, the nation's fourth-largest drugstore chain. At its 2,650 stores, Eckerd generated operating profit of $208 million for the accounting year that ended on Jan. 26, after a $76 million loss the previous year; sales rose 5.8 percent.
But these results are now being overshadowed by the allegations that Eckerd overbills its customers. Even as Penney announced earnings of $114 million from continuing operations last year, versus a loss of $568 million in fiscal 2001, the company's shares have drifted lower. Since the beginning of the year, the stock is down 26 percent.
In mid-February, the Florida attorney general's office said it had started a civil investigation into possible overbilling at Eckerd. In another civil investigation that began last month, the economic crimes division of the Florida attorney general's office is reviewing Eckerd's practice of giving customers a form to sign when they pick up prescriptions that supposedly provides verification that the medication was received and that the patient will accept prescription counseling by Eckerd. In much smaller type, the form says that by signing it, the customer agrees to, among other things, the release of prescription data to the parent company to provide "health and money-saving offers." Critics say the privacy of Eckerd's customers is being abused. 
OTHER states are also looking into Eckerd's billing practices. "It is on our radar screen," said Frank Adams, a spokesman for at the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, "but we cannot comment on ongoing investigations."
Several civil lawsuits have been filed recently against Eckerd. One is a class action filed in February by an Eckerd customer in Florida who said that, from April to November of last year, the company overcharged him on seven prescriptions. Another suit, filed against Eckerd and three other chains in November by the Texas Mutual Insurance Company, asserts that Eckerd has routinely inflated bills it submitted to the insurer, in some cases billing more than two and a half times Eckerd's customary charge for the same drug.
Eckerd said it is cooperating with the investigations and is confident it complies with laws and regulations. It said both the class-action suit brought by the Florida consumer contending overbilling and the Texas Mutual suit were without merit. 
No allegations have been proved. But Eckerd has gotten into trouble for overbilling before. In July, it pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought by the United States Justice Department in the middle district of Florida and paid a fine of $1.7 million. That case involved a practice known as partial filling, in which Eckerd filled only a portion of a prescription but recorded it as having been filled entirely and billed Florida's Medicaid program for the full amount. In the plea, Eckerd agreed that the four violations identified by investigators were not isolated incidents. Prosecutors estimated that partial filling at Eckerd cost Florida Medicaid as much as $2.5 million.
At the time, Robert E. Lewis, Eckerd's general counsel, said: "We are disappointed that the Justice Department singled Eckerd out for an industrywide problem that we addressed a number of years ago." 
Carmen A. Catizone, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, said the rising number of cases accusing Eckerd of questionable practices might have its roots in the transformation of the pharmacy industry. Once a decentralized business of local practitioners, he said, it is now dominated by giant, publicly traded companies under pressure to produce profits.
"The pharmacies are operating to ensure that the company does well," Mr. Catizone said. "I think it presents a conflict at times where there is a question: Is this in the best interest of a patient?"
Eckerd has certainly felt pressure to produce profits in recent years. Acquired in 1997, it showed an operating profit of $254 million in 1998. The next year, that fell to $183 million, and by 2000 it had swung to a loss of $76 million. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell from 4.9 percent of sales in 1998 to 1.9 percent in 2000.
To reverse the trend, Mr. Harris made a money-saving move in July 2001, when Eckerd froze pension benefits for its drugstore associates and reduced and capped company contributions to retirement plans. The changes produced a gain of $11 million in the third quarter.
But overbilling can produce far greater profits. The customer who filed the class-action suit in Florida asserts that on certain medications, Eckerd's computers automatically rounded up dosages to the nearest whole number and charged for that amount even though the extra medication was not dispensed.
As a result, the lawsuit said, the customer overpaid by almost $10 each time he had his prescription filled. Because Eckerd has 2,650 stores in 20 states, the suit estimates that it reaped more than $100 million from overbilling over nine months.
When the suit was filed, Eckerd said that although the billings showed a larger amount of medication dispensed than the patient received, the billing amount was proper. It also said it had upgraded its pharmacy billing system.
The suit brought by Texas Mutual also indicates just how profitable overbilling could have been for Eckerd. According to the complaint, Texas Mutual found 26 prescriptions for which Eckerd billed far more than it did for walk-in customers insured by Texas Mutual buying the same medications. For example, according to the suit, Eckerd's customary charge for 40 cephalexin antibiotic tablets was $28.79, but it charged Texas Mutual $77; while Eckerd normally charged $8.19 for 30 prescription ibuprofen pain-relief tablets, it billed Texas Mutual $20.11.
The lawsuit says Texas Mutual's initial investigation found that Eckerd overcharged the insurer by an average of $11.48 a prescription. The court filing said Eckerd acknowledged to Texas Mutual that it charges different amounts for workers' compensation claims and other claims. Eckerd has continued to submit inflated bills to Texas Mutual even after the insurer contacted it about overbilling, the lawsuit said.
One Eckerd pharmacist who spoke on condition of anonymity said the company also tries to pad its financial results by persuading customers to switch to drugs that generate greater profits. "Every month we get a document from Eckerd with a list of generic opportunities," this pharmacist said. "The last one I got was a month ago." The pharmacist said, for example, that Eckerd encourages employees to switch customers from Lanoxin, a heart medication from GlaxoSmithKline, to a generic that is less expensive.
IF an Eckerd pharmacist can persuade a customer to switch to a generic, the company can profit in several ways. First, Eckerd will incur lower costs by carrying an inventory of cheaper medications. And, the pharmacist explained, generic drugs are much more profitable to pharmacies because the dispensing fees on a $25 patented drug prescription and a $5 generic one are similar. "In pharmacy, you take the cost of the drug and tack on the dispensing fee," this person said. As a result, pharmacy profits skyrocket when patients switch to generics.
Because of agreements with some drug companies, Eckerd receives money when it switched people to higher-priced, patent-protected drugs, this pharmacist said. Such a practice would explain the recent experience of Curtis and Jean Thompson, longtime Eckerd customers in Wake Forest, N.C.
Their physician had prescribed Prilosec, a drug for heartburn and ulcers, for both of them. The patent for Prilosec, manufactured by Merck for AstraZeneca under a partnership, expired in October.
In June, Mrs. Thompson received a letter from Eckerd advising her that the Food and Drug Administration had recently approved a new drug, Nexium, to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. Saying the company considered itself "a partner in the management of your health care," the letter said Nexium provides many patients "complete resolution of their heartburn symptoms."
Enclosed was a coupon for a free seven-day trial of Nexium, which could be used only if her physician prescribed it. At the bottom of the letter was the following: "Funding for this educational mailing has been provided by AstraZeneca L.P."
Mrs. Thompson saved the letter but did nothing about it. Then, several months ago, the couple received a phone call at home from an Eckerd employee suggesting that Mr. Thompson switch from Prilosec to Nexium. Nexium is still covered by a patent and is more expensive.
Mrs. Thompson told the caller that her husband did not want to switch because his physician had specifically prescribed Prilosec. The call angered her, she said, so she telephoned her local Eckerd pharmacist, whom she trusted, to ask why she was being badgered to switch. He told her that it had not come from him and gave her the number of a consumer help line at Eckerd. She called that number, got no satisfaction and eventually called the Eckerd Therapeutic Support Center in Pittsburgh, which had sent her the letter.
"I said we did not like this and felt that someone there should put a stop to calling old people who were confused enough about their drugs," Mrs. Thompson said.
She went to Eckerd to pick up four of her husband's prescriptions, she said, and when she got home she found five drugs in the package. One vial contained Nexium and had cost more than $100.
"I called the local pharmacy and said, 'How did the Nexium get in there that hadn't been prescribed?' " Mr. Thompson recalled. "They said they had gotten a fax saying that the prescription was changed."
When Mrs. Thompson saw her doctor the next day, she asked about the Nexium. He told her someone had called him from Eckerd saying Mr. Thompson had approved the change. "The doctor was surprised to learn it was not our request," she said. 
An Eckerd spokeswoman said: "Like other drugstore chains we do have programs pursuant to which we provide our patients with timely information on products or treatments. We believe these programs comply fully with all laws and regulations." Mrs. Thompson is still angry about the switch. "It just wasn't the thing to do that I considered ethical," she said. "It may not be illegal but it is not ethical."
Many people eyeing Eckerd these days no doubt agree with her.

Dodgeball, In Adult Hands

BYLINE:  By Robert Lipsyte 

 BODY:
As we are constantly being reminded, this is a dodgeball world. People are always trying to knock you out of the game, because they hate you or because they want to win or because they are so filled with rage that they write "To whom it may concern" on the ball before they throw it. You can look at the front pages or the sports pages and find your own examples.
 And now people are arguing about dodgeball itself. For those who missed this elemental elementary school game, which also goes by the name bombardment and killer ball, there are variations, team and individual. But, basically, children try to hit one another with a large rubber ball. Last kid left wins. In the current debate over the game, some grown-ups say it causes psychological damage, others that it hardens school kids for the real world, as if gym class isn't real enough. 
 There's no question dodgeball is reality programming, what my adviser, the pseudonymous Archie Armstrong, 34, author of a play, "Bombardment," calls a combination of Stalinist purge, "Rocky" and "Survivor." There is scapegoating, bullying, victimology, thinning the herd, humiliation and a subtle lesson as important as this one: kids who hide behind weaker kids to avoid getting hit eventually get hit, too. 
On the other hand, the television producer Lou Charlip, 45, says he "loved the game because it was an opportunity for fat kids, klutzy kids without developed athletic skills to play hard and have fun." Then he told a golden lifetime story in which the tough jock fumbled young Lou's soft throw and was out of the game.
The National Association for Sport and Physical Education, which represents more than 18,000 teachers and professors, has condemned dodgeball. A Cambridge, Mass., physical education teacher, Thomas Murphy, told The Boston Globe, "Any time you throw an object at somebody, it creates an environment of retaliation and resentment. There is nothing positive that can happen except a bully gets to beat up on little kids."
Those who defend dodgeball -- and that includes the relatively new National Amateur Dodgeball Association, which holds outdoor and indoor championships for adults in Schaumburg, Ill. -- say it develops the transferable sports skills of teamwork, quick movements and change of direction, and the importance of keeping your eye on the ball at all times. 
Why is this all surfacing now, we ask, and I'm sure thelipsite@aol.com will get its typically shrewd, skewed answers with allusions to such dodgeball imitations as the attack on the World Trade Center, the bombing of Afghanistan and the Enron rip-off. Let's stick with sports.
Is it because traditional gym classes, where dodgeball has always been an easy rest period for lazy and mean teachers, are failing pupils? Kids are fatter and more out of shape than ever. Is it because the traditional dodgeball-coaching style -- bullying and humiliation -- seems back in vogue? Bob Knight was hired by Texas Tech and is showing success. Or is it because three of the largest traditional dodgeball-style organizations, the International Olympic Committee, Nascar and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, seem to making honest efforts to take the ball out of the hands of bullies and give everyone a chance to play fairly?
When I.O.C. members sold the Winter Games to Salt Lake City, that was business as usual. Once the scandal became public, by taking no immediate systemic action, the I.O.C. was just continuing the Avery Brundage-Juan Antonio Samaranch standard practice of dealing with bribery, commercialism, nationalism and doping as surprising aberrations.
But the swift action of Dr. Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, in the controversy over the awarding of pairs figure skating medals (whether or not the outrage was justified is beyond my judging powers) sent a welcome new message. He was admitting that something is basically amiss with Olympic officiating, at least in that sport, and something had to be done. Of course, skeptics will say, Rogge was really driven by the news media hype, which also boosted NBC's ratings.
All the speed at Nascar is usually on the track, and the stock-car organization was particularly slow in instituting safety reforms after the death of Dale Earnhardt. Some of that can be attributed to its stubborn and arrogant culture, some to its fear of appearing liable, at least in the court of fan opinion, if hard walls, rigid front ends and lax safety regulations were blamed. 
But there has been some greening on the banked track. Snipping a quarter-inch off the rear spoilers of the Fords before the Daytona 500 was an attempt to keep some competitive balance. Penalizing Sterling Marlin and Jeff Gordon -- front-runners in the race and in general -- for violations during a red-flag dead stop was another good try. Of course, say skeptics, in these tough economic times with sponsors pulling out, you had better penalize the deep-pocket teams or only a few drivers will win every race.
The N.C.A.A. has a long history of rarely penalizing important colleges, and certainly not hitting them hard. This may be changing. In the most notable of recent cases, the Alabama and Kentucky football teams lost scholarships and bowl appearances, heavy hits. At Alabama, recruits were given cars and cash by boosters. At Kentucky, the coach was bribing high school coaches and helping players cheat on classwork. Of course, the N.C.A.A. may be trying to clean up before the inevitable push to pay players over the table and a long overdue Congressional investigation.
But we never answered the original question: Is dodgeball good or bad?
Beats me.

A Market Lifted by Economic Data

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
A barrage of positive economic reports propelled stocks higher last week, as investors bet that the data signaled the end of the recession.
 The week began with a report by the National Association of Realtors that existing-home sales surged 16.2 percent in January. 
Then came news of an increase in orders for durable goods in January and of an unexpected rise of 1.4 percent in the nation's gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 2001. 
 Investors were further encouraged when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told a Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday that the economy appeared to be firming.
 A report on the nation's manufacturing sector, which recorded growth for the first time in 18 months, sent stocks on a broad-based rally on Friday.
 Semiconductor stocks gained ground after Intel and Novellus both issued positive comments. General Motors and Lowe's also recorded gains.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 400.71 points, or 4 percent, to 10,368.86. The Nasdaq composite index gained 78.20 points, or 4.5 percent, to 1,802.74. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 41.94 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,131.78.

HEADLINE: Crawling Out of Recession 

 BODY:
The major economies of the world are at present like trains side by side at a station. One or the other may be moving forward a bit, but it's hard for passengers looking out the window to tell whether it's their train or the one on the next track that is actually moving. Things are that slow, and may remain so for a time.
 At least in America's case, any backward movement has ceased. The Commerce Department announced Thursday that in the last quarter of 2001, the nation's economic output rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent. That better-than-expected performance was driven by strong consumer spending and is a tribute to the resilience of the American economy in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. In all of last year, the economy grew by a meager tenth of 1 percent. 
 If that is not reason enough to break out the champagne, consider this. There is now some question whether the country was ever really in a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research -- the arbiter that looks at a wide range of data, including monthly employment and manufacturing numbers, to make its calls -- announced in November that a recession had begun last March, ending the country's longest-ever uninterrupted expansion. But the slowdown failed to meet the widely accepted rule-of-thumb definition for a recession, of two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. Only in the third quarter of 2001 did the economy actually shrink.
Making future projections is difficult. Most indicators, including manufacturing measures that have been depressed for over a year, are looking increasingly optimistic, and corporate profits are expected to start growing again in the second quarter. But few are predicting a typical recovery to follow what has been a most atypical stumble.
Past boom-and-bust cycles have been driven by consumer spending, but the spectacular slowdown in the last two years, after the tech-driven euphoria of the late 90's, broke the pattern. It was linked to a plunge in capital investments by businesses that had overinvested, particularly in areas like telecommunications, where the term recession hardly begins to describe the financial pain these days.
Meanwhile, contrary to what is supposed to happen in a downturn, spending by consumers has remained strong, despite people's losses in the stock market, rises in unemployment and the sense of insecurity that followed Sept. 11. The housing market has also remained strong.
The Federal Reserve Bank deserves a great deal of credit for helping to prop up the consumer in the face of adversity. Alan Greenspan oversaw the most aggressive interest-rate slashing in the Fed's history, dropping the nation's key short-term rate down to 1.75 percent, from 6.5 percent, with 11 cuts in a single year. The White House's claim that its regressive 10-year tax cut plan, passed by the Congress, also helped ameliorate the economic slowdown cannot be taken seriously. Indeed, by jeopardizing the country's fiscal health, the Bush tax cuts may have helped prevent long-term interest rates from falling in tandem with short-term rates.
It will take a resumption of business investment, instead of the usual burst of pent-up consumer demand, to drive this recovery. Mr. Greenspan sounded a cautious note of optimism when he testified before Congress last week, acknowledging that "influences unique to this business cycle" would temper the anticipated recovery. He is apparently in no hurry to start pushing rates back up. 
More than a million jobs have been lost to the slowdown in the last year, and Mr. Greenspan reflected the overwhelming consensus among economists when he said he expected the unemployment rate to continue rising, even during a recovery. That makes it all the more imperative for Republican leaders in the House of Representatives to stop holding an extension of unemployment benefits hostage to a package of further reckless tax cuts. 
What is true for the country at large is particularly true for the increasing numbers of unemployed Americans. This train is moving too slowly as it pulls out of the station.

The War on Terror Points a Country Toward Peace

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
JUST over the horizon from Afghanistan, another war on terror may be drawing to a close. A week ago, the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, one of Asia's most ruthless and totalitarian rebel movements, agreed to a firm cease-fire, with the promise of peace talks to come. It is not a coincidence that this should occur within months of Sept. 11, many Sri Lankans and foreign experts say. A new international environment, born of the revulsion, shock or just plain fear engendered by attacks on the United States, has made it possible.
 The situation has parallels in Northern Ireland, where it has been widely assumed that a decision by the Irish Republican Army in October to start turning in arms was also related to a new atmosphere low on romanticism for violent causes. 
 But the new environment works two ways. In other areas, as worried human rights organizations point out, countries have felt emboldened to deal more harshly with rebel movements -- from Russia to Uzbekistan, India, China, Colombia and the Philippines. Far from pushing these conflicts toward negotiation, the zero-tolerance approach has worked to intensify the push for a military solution -- if only because both sides feel they can win.
Robert B. Oakley, a former American ambassador in Pakistan, Somalia and Congo and a former State Department counterterrorism director, says the American campaign against Al Qaeda "sort of puts a damper on a movement, and it encourages people to take a stronger stand against it." At the same time, he said, governments find it easier to label any rebel a terrorist. "It encourages people to say: 'Hey! Come help me deal with my internal problems because they all are terrorist related.' "
In Sri Lanka, there is no longer much dispute about the nature of the Tamil rebellion, which began as a movement to rectify discrimination by the country's ethnic Sinhalese majority and turned, under the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, into a brutal campaign of terror that annihilated the moderate opposition through assassination and dragooned children, who were taught to embrace suicide. At least 65,000 people have died.
Well before Sept. 11, the United States and Britain had declared the Tigers a terrorist organization; so had India, which once trained them but is now seeking the extradition of their leader, Velupillai Prabakharan, for plotting the assassination in 1991 of the Indian leader Rajiv Gandhi. Many governments have vowed to stop the rebels' global fund-raising.
An issue more relevant now to Sri Lankans and others in need of help to achieve peace is whether their wars on terrorism matter to important nations, most of all the United States. Last Monday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appealed for concrete outside help in keeping pressure on the Tigers to honor this truce, and in rebuilding the economy.
Sri Lankans know there are disadvantages in being far off the beaten track from the hunt for Al Qaeda. Not only are there no significant links to Muslim terrorists, a Sri Lankan official said. "We don't have oil. We are of no use to the United States or other powers." Nepal, facing a Maoist rebellion of intense violence, is also off the American radar. Instead, American troops have rushed to the southern Philippines to train Filipino troops battling Abu Sayaf, a less threatening group by many measures, except for reported links to Al Qaeda.
Most recently, the Bush administration began considering military assistance to Yemen, where suicide bombers killed 17 sailors on the destroyer Cole in 2000, and to Georgia, where a border area is believed to be the staging ground for Muslims who, with help from Al Qaeda fighters, are rebelling against Russian rule in Chechnya. But the possibility of putting American troops as trainers in that sensitive area sets off alarms in Russia -- and also among human rights groups, who fear it would only encourage Russia in its brutal tactics against Chechen separatists.
IN Colombia, President Andres Pastrana has abruptly abandoned a peace agreement after provocative rebel kidnappings and scattered attacks, and last week resumed war against leftist guerrillas allied with drug dealers. Victoria Sanford, an anthropology professor at the University of Notre Dame who has worked in Colombia recently, said American objectives there may actually be hindering peace moves. "I think that Pastrana deeply cares about peace in Colombia," she said, "but Pastrana can only implement and push for peace if he is supported by the United States. If the United States isn't going to back up his peace initiatives, they fall apart."
In Sri Lanka, Norway alone has come to the aid of the peace-minded government by talking the Tigers into a truce. Now cease-fire monitors from the Nordic countries are preparing bases, and roads are being opened to allow freer movement by Sri Lankans who have lived in privation under Tiger rule and a government economic embargo. That is only a small beginning, said Radikha Coomaraswamy, director of the International Center for Ethnic Studies in Colombo, adding that there will have to be a major international presence in Tiger territory. 
Teresita C. Schaffer, who was the American ambassador to Sri Lanka from 1992 to 1995, expressed reservations about how much foreign efforts to ban the Tigers and stop their money-raising would hinder the group, which has a worldwide network of front companies, its own shipping line, and a history of overrunning Sri Lankan army bases to steal arms.
STILL, she said, the Tigers may be weakened militarily, which could explain their inability to recapture Jaffna. "Why did they stop?" she said. "I have to believe it was because they couldn't go on."
In the end, that may be the deciding factor in whether the no-tolerance atmosphere toward terrorism pushes a particular conflict toward negotiation or war. Even if the Tigers are now hoping only to buy time for rearming and recruitment, as many Sri Lankans fear, there is a peace constituency in the country as well as an antiterrorism sentiment outside, Ms. Schaffer said. And in that country, at least, the combination may make this the moment to make an agreement stick.

Money Market Fund Yields Drop

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer

 BODY:
Yields on money market funds plunged to record lows last week, reflecting the lagging effects of the Federal Reserve's cuts in short-term interest rates last year.
 For the week ending Tuesday, the average seven-day yield for taxable funds fell to 1.39 percent from 1.41 percent a week earlier, according to iMoneyNet of Westborough, Mass. 
Tax-free funds fell to 0.89 percent from 0.9 percent. 
 Short-term interest rates have plummeted as a result of 11 rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Although the Fed has not cut rates since December, money market yields have continued to decline. 
None of the 783 money funds tracked by iMoneyNet now yield more than 2 percent, and several funds have cut the expenses they charge to investors to keep their returns positive.
The highest seven-day yield among taxable money funds belonged to the Bunker Hill Money Market fund and the Touchstone Money Market fund, both at 1.92 percent, followed by the PayPal Money Market fund at 1.88 percent, the agency said. 
Among tax-free money market funds, the highest seven-day yield was 1.40 percent, at Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market.

HEADLINE: The Transformation Of Accounting Firms 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Watchdog? Lap Dog? Why Have to Guess?" (Market Watch, Feb. 17) listed 16 companies that paid more than 90 percent of their fees to accounting firms for services other than auditing. The column noted that accounting firms' audit work, which brings lower fees, "could be jeopardized by the desire to maintain the more lucrative consulting relationship." 
 Even though major accounting firms have long disputed this position, they have finally recognized that perception is reality and have or are spinning off their consulting practices from the audit and tax practices. What are the ramifications of this unbundling process?
One clear result is that audit fees must be raised. They must rise to attract the best and brightest into a profession for which there is no substitute in our economic system. Audit fees must also be increased to offset the loss of higher-margin consulting services. Fees for audit services must now stand on their own and reflect the fair, proportionate cost of doing business in our increasingly complex business world.

Track and Casino Turn a Rust Belt Town Green

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: CHESTER, W.Va., Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The sense of mortality can seem overwhelming along the depressed Ohio River Valley as Big Steel heads into the Big Sleep and hundreds of dish and pottery factories -- the valley's old artisan glory -- dwindle to a precious few.
 But wait: a gray-haired retiree bused in from Pittsburgh has just hit the big payoff in nickels over at the video slots in a flourishing gambling oasis called Speakeasy. 
 Outside, beyond the gleeful bonging and beeping of the 2,000 slot machines, an ultramodern racetrack is being groomed for another night of Thoroughbred betting by blue-collar commuters from Ohio searching for merciful odds along a riverfront dotted with snow patches and abandoned factories.
Downtown at Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6450, even the veterans' long-illicit civic boon of modest gambling for money and charity has come out of the closet, legalized at last with new video slots ready for the growing market. 
Somehow, Chester, W.Va., population 2,723, is becoming known as a "destination resort" for gamblers, with Tony Bennett, Kenny Rogers and other high-roller saloon singers booked to croon where the action is, down at the growing Mountaineer Race Track and Gaming Resort.
Tucked away at the crest of West Virginia's narrow northern panhandle, this tiny city is at the heart of an economic renaissance that is drawing 35,000 gamblers a week from nearby Pennsylvania and Ohio, where slot machine action is illegal. West Virginia is only a few miles wide at this point, but it beckons like El Dorado.
"We used to think gambling was a sin around here," said Shirley Barnhart, the city clerk, amused at all the virtue that Chester and surrounding communities are discovering in slot machines and pari mutuel betting.
Ten years ago, Mountaineer was a failing backwater track known as Waterford Downs. The crowds were sparse and the purses laughable, as cheap claimers tried to outrun the abattoir. Its tired venue matched the region's rusting steel mills.
But then Edson Arneault, better known as Ted, arrived like a rainmaker and turned a small state experiment with limited video gambling at the track into a low-roller slice of Las Vegas that has created hundreds of jobs and fed tens of millions of dollars in fresh revenue into government coffers. Tapping into a blue-collar market of eight million people within a two-hour drive, Mr. Arneault's company is rated one of the nation's fastest growing by Forbes and Fortune, generating $218 million in revenues last year and $19 million in profits in an area rife with the symptoms of depression.
"I call it a Joe Six-Pack crowd," Mr. Arneault said of his customers, who can bet modestly, from 5 cents to $5, at Mountaineer. "They're great. They don't have the whims and whimsy of big players in Vegas, and they tend to be shielded from tremendous changes in the economy and stock market. For them, it's entertainment."
Mr. Arneault managed to get the legislature to allow a big slot-machine casino to be added to the racetrack, with a convention center, a spa and more than 300 hotel rooms. The gambling mecca has become a regional monopoly, 35 miles from Pittsburgh and 60 miles from Akron. It contributed more than $50 million to West Virginia last year, while local governments gained $3.5 million.
His company, the MTR Gaming Group, has put money back into the track and its purses and entered the larger lucrative world of off-track betting. In five years, Mountaineer's sales have increased an average of 43 percent and earnings 54 percent.
"Before this, all that we were known for was the World's Largest Teapot out on the highway," said Mayor Ken Morris, a steelworker, referring to Chester's lingering identity as the home of Fiesta Ware. Now gambling dwarfs the teapot, with more than a quarter of the city's $400,000 budget from Mountaineer revenue.
"And they just gave us a new police car, too," Mr. Morris said gratefully, noting that the state had become relaxed enough about gambling to permit video slots to other institutions, like the V.F.W. hall. "Now it's legal, and everybody gets their cut."
The cut's ramifications are many. Not only is Dana Picciarelli, a member of the City Council, working for Mountaineer in the vault department, but Geoff Rovin, a substance abuse therapist in nearby Weirton, is busier, too. He is one of 50 counselors on call for gambling addicts who turn to the Problem Gamblers Help Network of West Virginia.
"Gamblers tend to think they have a cash flow problem, not an addiction problem," said Mia Moran-Cooper, the Problem Gamblers program director, estimating that one in five gamblers has a problem.
But like the health hazards of the dead steel mills, such is the cost of doing business. The traffic remains steady outside City Hall as the bridge from Ohio and the mountain road from Pennsylvania funnel fresh gamblers onto the streets of Chester in a beeline to the slots.
"I kind of wish we stayed back in the old economy," Ms. Barnhart, the city clerk, said wistfully, though hardly moralizing about the Chester renaissance. "It was nice when we were the pottery center of the U.S."

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
Bangladeshis Hold Suburban Dream Together, Without Buttons

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: HUDSON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
FOR a while, it looked as if Bangla was on its way to becoming this city's official second language.
 Few of Hudson's 8,000 residents realized it at the time. All the attention went to the antique stores popping up along Warren Street, to the culture clash that ensued when a dying-but-not-dead industrial town was overrun by artsy types and second-home buyers from Manhattan. 
 But on the drug-infested north side, hard by the Hudson River, a wholly different migration was bringing the inflections and aromas of Dhaka, and of Jackson Heights, to scores of second-story apartments and creaking clapboard houses. 
It started sometime after 1986, when the Emsig Manufacturing Corporation, the nation's largest maker of buttons -- an old but little-known giant of the garment industry -- abandoned its ancient West 60th Street plant in Manhattan after a fire. With incentives from the state, Emsig opened a new factory on a reclaimed landfill here, a two-hour drive up the Thruway.
As the story goes, a man named Abutale was the first Bangladeshi to take a job there. Aminul Hoque was the sixth, arriving from Queens in August 1994 with his wife and daughter, a good command of English, and a deep desire to help his countrymen escape the crime and high cost of living in New York City.
At Emsig, the diligent Mr. Hoque was quickly put in charge of training new workers. Turnover was so high, fueled by rampant cocaine and heroin use, that he was as exhausted as his bosses were frustrated. "I'd have to work my work, and when I was training someone, I'd have to do his work, too," said Mr. Hoque, now 43. "And the next week, or the next day, they don't show up."
The bosses asked if Mr. Hoque knew any more Bangladeshis with his kind of work ethic. So Mr. Hoque became Worker Zero, bringing at least 10 families to Hudson from New York or from his homeland. Indirectly, he says, he is responsible for nearly 75 of the roughly 200 of his countrymen who eventually moved here.
With monthly rents as low as $275 -- before being split among several workers -- the Bangladeshi community flourished. A basement was turned into a mosque, a part-time imam lured from an apple-packaging plant in New Paltz to work alongside his flock on the Emsig assembly line.
And the button factory, bolstered by a stable work force, spat out four million buttons a day over three shifts, the sweet smell of polyester resin fumes overtaking the odors of the old landfill. In 1998, the factory was enlarged, with help from the state and city: a $1.6 million low-interest loan, 15-year tax abatements and discounts on electricity.
BUT buttons imported from China and, to a lesser extent, button-free fashions, were eating away at Emsig's sales. In 1999, according to records shown to officials of Unite, the garment industry union, Emsig lost $860,000. Losses reached $1 million in 2000. The overnight shift was laid off first. Then, late last year, the rumors were confirmed: Feb. 5 would be the factory's last day.
Now, as Mr. Hoque helps his countrymen once more -- this time to pursue unemployment benefits, alternative medical coverage, accrued sick and vacation pay, and settlements from the union pension plan -- the fate of this Bangladeshi colony is suddenly in doubt.
The Dewan family may have lost the most. "I hurt so much that I'm numb," said Dewan H. Ullah, 55, who left a job in a Manhattan parking lot to run a laser engraver on the first shift. His wife, Dewan Azima Khatun, 45, plucked out poor-quality buttons on the second shift. Their son, daughter and son-in-law worked there too, for hourly wages of $9.10 to $10.50.
Some Bangladeshis have already moved away, but the Dewans hope to stay. Mr. Dewan loves the fresh air here. And his children have put down roots beyond a mortgage. Bashar, 22, the only adult child who never worked at Emsig, married his Hudson High School sweetheart, Elsie. They have a 3-year-old toddler, Jasmine.
Eleven in all, the Dewans bought a house. From the outside it looks like a remnant of an urban renewal effort given up long ago: prefabricated, two-story, tumbledown. But inside is a palace of plush carpets and oriental rugs, three freezers full of whole carp, hilsa shad and buffalo fish, and savory samosas teeming from the oven.
It is a palace worth preserving. Tomorrow, Mr. Dewan will drive to a factory in Kingston, 40 miles away, in a car with four other former button men. Mrs. Dewan, acknowledged as the community's best cook, wants to start catering, and if that works, perhaps open a Bengali restaurant.
A Mexican restaurant that opened here did not survive, but Mrs. Dewan is undeterred. "I'll try anything," she said.

HEADLINE: TV Executive Defeats Police Chief To Become Mayor of New Orleans 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
A cable television executive with no political experience was elected mayor of New Orleans yesterday, sweeping past the city's police chief in a come-from-behind victory.
 The executive, C. Ray Nagin, 45, will succeed Mayor Marc A. Morial, who was barred by law from seeking a third term. Mr. Morial made no endorsement in the race, declining to support Richard J. Pennington, the police chief he brought from Washington in 1994. 
 Unofficial results last night showed Mr. Nagin with 58 percent of the vote and Mr. Pennington, who led in polls when the campaign began, with 42 percent.
"New Orleans is going to do things different," Mr. Nagin told cheering supporters after Mr. Pennington conceded Saturday night. I'm not in it for the money, I'm in it for our children and grandchildren."
 Although both men are Democrats and black, each presented a different approach to running one of the country's poorest large cities. Mr. Nagin, who is on leave as a vice president of Cox Communications, which operates the local cable system, emphasized his business background as a foundation for rebuilding the city's economy and creating jobs. Having entered the race late with little name recognition, he spent freely, and proposed selling or leasing Louis Armstrong International Airport and using the revenue to rebuild decaying infrastructure and create jobs.
Mr. Pennington ran on his record of reducing the city's murder rate, vowing to bring similar improvements to education.
But opinion polls showed that Mr. Nagin's business experience, and lack of political ties, held significant appeal for many voters in the city's black middle-class and white neighborhoods. 
Mr. Pennington was seen by many voters as too close to the city's political establishment, with its history of cronyism and sweetheart contracts.
The campaign turned nasty in the last few weeks of the runoff campaign, with Mr. Pennington accusing Mr. Nagin of Republican tendencies, and Mr. Nagin saying the police chief had been on public assistance his entire career. 
Mr. Nagin later apologized for the remark.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-03-02: DOCUMENT; 
Rambo Takes a Hit

BYLINE:  By Cameron Stracher 

 BODY:
It's not easy facing the twilight years in an Enron economy. First, Ken Lay had to sell the house in Aspen. Now, another aging pensioner is shocked -- shocked! -- by the financial shenanigans going on under his very own nose. In a lawsuit filed on Feb. 14 in California Superior Court in Los Angeles, Sylvester (Sly) Stallone alleges that he was led financially astray by one Kenneth Starr -- not the Clinton nemesis but Stallone's business manager and investment adviser. Stallone, a litigious fellow who has sued not only his father-in-law for mishandling his money but also his former nannies, landscapers, car dealers, real-estate agents, art dealers, producers and wives, accuses Starr of duping him into holding onto shares of Planet Hollywood stock until it was virtually worthless. 
 The suit depicts Stallone as a conservative investor, averse to risk, who considered the inside of a mattress the perfect investment vehicle. "When Stallone first retained Starr & Company as his business manager/investment adviser, he advised Kenneth Starr that he wanted to be invested only in conservative investments that were liquid . . . and that he wanted most of his investments to be in the form of cash, cash equivalents and other low-risk, liquid investments that would allow him peace of mind and easy access to his funds." 
 As a founder of Planet Hollywood, however, he didn't want to be cut out of the action. " Stallone wanted to make sure that he would receive substantial monetary compensation for the services he had rendered and was continuing to render to Planet Hollywood International for which Plaintiffs were issued the shares of stock. Stallone was advised by Kenneth Starr not to sell the stock, that by doing so he would be hurting the company . . . as he would be sending the wrong message to the market, and that the price of the Planet Hollywood International stock could be expected to go much higher." 
Stallone contends that he was sacrificed in favor of one of Starr's other clients, Keith Barish, a member of Planet Hollywood's board. "Kenneth Starr was aware that if Plaintiffs sold their stock, such a sale might depress the stock price, which would jeopardize or lessen the value of the holdings of Starr & Company's other client, Keith Barish." Barish, the suit alleges, was the real insider, while Stallone never got to peak behind the velvet rope.
Ultimately, of course, it's all about money. "Plaintiffs have sustained damages in an unknown amount, but believed to be in excess of $10 million, based upon the sale price they could have received had Kenneth Starr and Starr & Company acted in Stallone's best interest and advised him to sell the shares of Planet Hollywood International stock at then prevailing market prices." Instead, he was forced to cash out for a meager $295,000. Sounds like coupon-clipping time for Sly and the family Stallone. Cameron Stracher

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Page 28 of The Times Magazine today about a current lawsuit filed by Sylvester Stallone misidentifies one of the people involved in a previous Stallone lawsuit. It was his former stepfather, not his father-in-law.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
Only Japan's Wealthy Welcome at This Bank

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
TO Koichiro Kitade, Japan is part paradise, part paradox. Mr. Kitade, director of the Citigroup Private Bank here, has the enviable task of finding clients who hold part of the country's vast $10.5 trillion in personal savings. There are plenty of wealthy people here, but battered by recession, deflation and a lack of choices, the Japanese are among the world's most tightfisted investors. More than half their money is stashed in savings accounts that earn almost no interest.
 By most reckoning, though, Mr. Kitade appears to have solved a riddle that has perplexed bankers here for years: how to persuade the Japanese to move even a fraction of their money into potentially more rewarding investments. Amid the rubble of Japan's financial system, sales at Citigroup's private banking services, which are open to investors with assets of at least 300 million yen ($2.3 million), have grown more than 25 percent a year for four years. 
 That puts Citigroup's private bank in a league with the insurer Aflac Japan, the investment firm Goldman Sachs and a handful of other foreign companies that have carved out a niche in Japan's insular and sometimes hostile financial markets. In fact, Citigroup is growing just as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and others retreat from retail finance in Japan. Those companies pulled up stakes in recent months after attempts to woo individual investors fell flat. 
Their exit reinforced the Japanese stereotype of American companies as fair-weather opportunists. But Citigroup promotes itself as a stable alternative to those brokers, who swaggered with confidence in the late 1990's. Its longevity -- it has been in Japan a century -- and its low-key image apparently worked: Citigroup's fortunes have risen as stock and real estate prices have fallen to near two-decade lows and reports have surfaced daily raising questions about the health of the nation's banks.
Therein lies the key to its success. The further that confidence in domestic lenders slips, the better opportunity that global companies with deep pockets have to sell security to conservative investors. "We provide safety, while most local banks have difficulty even maintaining their existence," Mr. Kitade said.
Sitting in a well-appointed meeting room with plush sofas and an unobstructed view of the Imperial Palace, Mr. Kitade outlines another, entirely un-Japanese feature of his bank: its sales pitch. In a country where 9 out of 10 people consider themselves middle class, banks often move in lock step by offering one-size-fits-all financial products. The Japanese affinity for understatement also means that even the wealthiest people visit the corner A.T.M.
But Citigroup, like its foreign rivals here, focuses on an emerging class of savers who travel overseas and understand the Western notion that wealth bestows a better brand of service. That is why Citigroup's private bank has its own office, separate from its retail operation across the street in Tokyo's Otemachi financial district.
"Citigroup is private and global, so as a customer you become part of a self-selected elite," said Robert Kopech, managing director at Oliver, Wyman & Company, an international financial services consultant. "This is a novel approach in Japan, where historically the trend has been toward homogeneity."
The approach carries into marketing. Comparative advertising is often shunned as crass in Japan, where companies of all stripes try to project a "friend next door" image of reliability and plainness. So when Mr. Kitade took over the private-banking operation in 1997 and ran advertisements asking only the wealthy to apply, Japanese banks accused him of discrimination.
The weekly ads, however, were an instant hit, with 20 percent of the respondents signing on as customers. The number of clients doubled in 1998 and has since grown 20 percent a year, to about 7,500. Assets under management have more than tripled, to $12 billion, helping the private banking group earn about $30 million after taxes last year, according to Henry McVey, a Morgan Stanley analyst.
By 2005, Mr. Kitade hopes to more than double his client list, to 20,000. 
Getting to this point, however, has not been easy. Citigroup started offering private banking services in 1986, during Japan's bubble years, when millionaires were born daily on the stock market and banks were for pensioners. The subsequent crash sent shell-shocked investors scurrying for cash and bonds, not fancy derivatives and dollar accounts. And private banks here, unlike those in the United States, cannot charge consulting fees. Kicked to the side, Citigroup's private bank division lost money its first 11 years.
But the situation turned around in 1997, when financial reforms in Japan started pulling down the walls that long protected banks, brokers and insurers from one another. Commissions on stock trades were deregulated, and banks lost their monopoly on foreign exchange transactions. Those two steps have forced financial institutions to develop unique products at lower prices.
At the same time, the collapse of several large banks and brokers focused investors' attention on stability. Citigroup's international bank, Citibank, with a double-A credit rating that is just two notches below the top possible grade, became a magnet for investors seeking safety and an easier path to moving money offshore. To that end, Citigroup, like many private banks, employs Japanese speakers at its branches in New York, London, Geneva, Singapore, Hong Kong and Honolulu.
THIS global reach is what brought Kohei Yamanaka in the door. Mr. Yamanaka, 57, now an adviser to the Hoya Corporation, an industrial glassmaker, traveled abroad monthly while he worked his way up the ladder at the company, with regular stops in Frankfurt, Hong Kong and New York. (Rome and Hawaii were reserved for holidays.) He opened a savings account in 1995 so he could use his A.T.M. card overseas.
Kentaro Kaneko, one of Citigroup's 70 private bankers in Japan, approached Mr. Yamanaka, who opened a private banking account after four months. Mr. Yamanaka, like most Japanese, knew nothing about private banking, so Mr. Kaneko guided him through the basics. 
The hard work, however, started after the account was opened. Most Japanese have a high proportion of their savings tied up in businesses, homes and insurance policies. They are often reluctant to sell assets. People like Mr. Yamanaka, who own huge amounts of stock accumulated over decades, face stiff capital gains taxes when they sell. 
Over all, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers study, wealthy Asian households, on average, have 40 percent of their money in deposits, 20 percent in real estate, 20 percent in managed funds and just 10 percent in securities. Rich Americans, by contrast, keep most of their money in equities and a small amount in cash.
In Mr. Yamanaka's case, almost all his wealth was wrapped up in his company's stock, which he accumulated over many years. So Citigroup helped him shift 15 percent of his money gradually into global equity funds, bonds, Japanese stock index funds, real estate investment trusts and foreign currency time deposits, especially those in dollars. "Since Japan's economy is getting worse," he said, "money in Japanese banks can't generate decent returns, so I thought it was time to leave the nest and seek better returns overseas."
Mr. Yamanaka was also introduced to Cititrust, a unit of Citigroup that manages trust accounts. Cititrust helped him buy an apartment building in Tokyo; the rent from the property produces a 7 percent return. He has also availed himself of the extra perks that private banks shower on clients, like fireworks displays and jazz concerts. He is also angling for tickets to the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Ga. Citigroup's branch in Honolulu is helping him look for a home on the islands.
OF course, Japanese private banks fawn over their clients, too, but with less fanfare. Their main selling point is their nationwide networks and ability to leverage property into other liquid assets. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, with 310 domestic branches, also works with a major homebuilder to spot potential clients. "You have to understand the nature of the Japanese and the large amount of land they hold," said Sunao Hirai, head of the private banking group at Dai-Ichi Kangyo.
Citigroup casts a smaller, finer net. Instead of trying to find clients who want a little better service at home, the bank seeks those more interested in moving money overseas. In effect, it is offering to bump up clients to business class, but also to charter them a whole new jet.

HEADLINE: Saving at Wal-Mart, But Paying a Price 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Enriched by Working Class, Wal-Mart Eyes BMW Crowd" (front page, Feb. 24) did not mention a significant reason behind Wal-Mart's success: the company's overt anti-unionism and the low wages paid to its employees. 
 Wal-Mart's grocery prices do often undercut those at competing supermarkets, and this is to a large degree because the retail food industry tends to be unionized and thus to pay workers a living wage and decent benefits. 
Wal-Mart's sales associates tend to earn minimum wage with few benefits. 
 This saves the company money on payroll and perhaps also keeps the customers coming, because Wal-Mart's more than one million employees can't afford to shop anywhere else.

HEADLINE: A Far-Right Militia's Far-Fetched Plot Draws Some Serious Attention 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: KALISPELL, Mont., March 2 

 BODY:
As its secrets began to spill out here this week, Project 7 sounded suspiciously like a Monty Python sketch.
 A dogcatcher was on its list of 26 local law enforcement officials who needed killing. The chief intelligence gatherer for the furtive far-right militia cell was a cleaning woman, according to Sheriff James R. Dupont of Flathead County, who himself made the hit list of Project 7. The militia's name comes from the Montana license plate numbering system, which uses the numeral 7 to identify residents of Flathead. 
 The cleaning woman, Tracy Brockway, 32, was having an affair with the leader of Project 7 in a house bristling with 35 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition, the sheriff said. He identified the militia's leader as David Earl Burgert, 38, whose last known job was renting snowmobiles, who could often be heard carping about judges on a local right-wing radio station and who has a long history of being annoying. At Christmas, when his neighbors lined streets with paper bags containing lighted candles, Mr. Burgert mounted his snowmobile and snuffed them out. 
"If you picture a schoolyard bully who has a big mouth, that would be Burgert," said Bruce Parish, a detective in the sheriff's office.
This far northwest corner of Montana, along with the nearby northern neck of Idaho, has for decades been incubating right-wing militias, conspiracy theorists and white supremacists. Many of them have demonstrated an outsize appetite for military hardware and survival gear.
Kalispell (population 17,000) might seem an unlikely staging ground for militias bearing grudges. It is the county seat of Flathead County, one of the fastest-growing communities in Montana and a pristine outdoor destination that includes half of Glacier National Park and more than a million acres of mountain wilderness. The town is near the northern end of Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the West and one of the cleanest lakes in the world.
Yet a decades-old decline in an economy based on logging and mining, combined with the rise of a New West culture dominated by affluent professionals and retirees who go outside not to work but to recreate, has left many local people confused, resentful and looking for someone to blame. Project 7 appears to have set a new standard, both for zany scapegoating and for industrial-strength firepower.
"This is the weirdest, most violence-prone thing we have seen in Montana for a long time," said Ken Toole, a Democratic state senator who runs the Montana Human Rights Network, which studies right-wing movements in Montana and Idaho. "There is a comic element to these people," Mr. Toole said. "But it washes away pretty quickly because of the guns."
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are taking it all seriously.
On Friday, after a long meeting with the county sheriff and the police chief in Kalispell, the F.B.I. took charge of the conspiracy investigation into possible links that Mr. Burgert may have had with other right-wing groups. The A.T.F. took charge of tracking all the weapons.
After a tip early last month from a Project 7 defector, the sheriff's department found two trailers packed with 30,000 rounds of ammunition, a broad array of small arms, body armor, pipe bombs, exploding booby traps, bomb-making chemicals and a vast inventory of survivalist gear and military rations.
"I think it would have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy all that stuff at once," Detective Parish said. "So it is very possible that it was built up over several years."
What Project 7 was gearing up for, said the defector who tipped off the sheriff, was a round of assassinations in early summer. The sheriff's department discovered a list of what appeared to be targets that included local judges, the county prosecutor, the Kalispell chief of police, members of a police swat team and the dogcatcher.
Some of the targets worked at a police station in the nearby town of Whitefish, where Mrs. Brockway was employed. The sheriff said she had apparently sifted through trash baskets, gleaning information about where some officers filled their prescriptions and how others struggled with their weight. The sheriff's department found information sheets detailing her discoveries.
"The logic of their plan, if you can call it logic, was that by killing local law enforcement people, the state of Montana would have no choice but to send in the National Guard," Sheriff Dupont said. "Then they hoped to wipe out the National Guard. And then they hoped that NATO troops would be sent in and that would trigger an all-out revolution."
The sheriff and Detective Parish rolled their eyes incredulously as they explained what Project 7 hoped to accomplish. They suggested that Mr. Burgert was a blowhard who had bitten off more than he could chew.
Investigators from the sheriff's department say they have identified four or perhaps five local people who were involved in the plot. Two of them, Mr. Burgert and Mrs. Brockway, are in custody. Two of the others have told investigators that while they knew about Project 7, they had no intention of killing anyone.
Sheriff Dupont learned of the plot in early February, after Mr. Burgert disappeared for nearly a month. Mr. Burgert's wife reported him mysteriously absent on Jan. 9. His pickup truck was found near a local river, with his fishing pole. His wife hinted to the sheriff's department that maybe he had drowned.
The sheriff's department, though, smelled a rat. Mr. Burgert had no hook on his fishing line and his tackle box, deputies said, was filled with lures that no respectable Montana fisherman would ever use.
On Feb. 7, Mr. Burgert, who had become a fugitive after failing to show up for a hearing on charges that he punched a sheriff's deputy in early 2001, was spotted coming out of Mrs. Brockway's home.
Her husband, Alan Brockway, also a suspect in the militia plot, left Montana for Israel several months ago. "The information we have is that he left because of the affair between his wife and Mr. Burgert," Detective Parish said.
After Mr. Burgert was spotted, sheriff's deputies staked out the house. When he and Mrs. Brockway drove off in a heavy snowstorm, deputies gave chase. Mr. Burgert slid off the road, but fled into the woods, carrying a rifle. After trackers found him and after an all-night standoff, during which Mr. Burgert held the gun under is chin and threatened to shoot himself, he surrendered.
All this happened in early February, which was when local investigators first got wind of Project 7 and the assassination plot. The sheriff's office kept the lid on its investigation, as computer experts from the state police tried -- and, so far, failed -- to crack encrypted information found on Mr. Burgert's home computer.
The lid came off on Tuesday, when Mrs. Brockway went to court for a bond hearing. On the witness stand, she announced the existence of Project 7 and local reporters began asking questions. Sheriff Dupont and other local law enforcement officials quickly decided to reveal the inquiry. 
"The real scary part of this whole deal is, what if we had not got onto Mr. Burgert?" the sheriff asked in an interview on Friday evening in his office. "Could he have recruited enough people to execute the plan?"
Answering his own question, the sheriff said he doubted Mr. Burgert's conspiratorial skills. "It was always his mouth that got him in trouble," the sheriff said.

HEADLINE: Big Burden for Ex-Workers of Enron 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 1 

 BODY:
It has come to this for Laura Chapa: After sending out more than 300 resumes since losing her job at Enron three months ago, she had gotten exactly two interviews and no jobs. Then she got a tip from her daughter, Bernadette, who works in a jobs program for college students that needed more people.
 So Ms. Chapa, 40, who had been a software tester at Enron, drove to an interview on Thursday. She was one of 12 applicants for four positions. She wore a black business suit; the other candidates wore jeans. If she is accepted, the one-way trip from her suburban home will be 47 miles. 
 It would bring no benefits, no vacation, no sick days and half her salary at Enron. She would be required to enroll in a local college. But she is praying she gets it. 
"It's a job, how's that?" Ms. Chapa explained.
For most of the 4,000 former workers who were laid off at Enron's headquarters here when the company filed for bankruptcy in December, the search for new jobs has been slow, painful and frustrating. Part of the problem is the slack local job market, which absorbed 20,000 layoffs last year. But many former Enron employees also say they believe that company's now-infamous tilted "E" logo, once a symbol of excellence but now synonymous with corporate corruption, has become a scarlet letter on their resumes.
Precise figures on the employment status of ex-Enron workers are not available. Some have found jobs, others are starting businesses. But the overwhelming majority are still believed to be jobless, most of them low- and midlevel employees who saw their retirement accounts decimated and are now struggling to pay their bills. 
Some have sent hundreds of resumes without getting an interview. Others say that, during interviews, they have been quizzed about their ethics or chastised about Enron's corporate culture.
"You really can't find a job," said Gwen Gray, 42, who spent three years at Enron working as a senior human resources assistant and has already lost one clerical job because of her ties to the company. "I've been sending out resumes like crazy."
The frustration boiled over last Monday during a town hall meeting of about 320 ex-Enron workers with the company's acting chief executive, Stephen F. Cooper. The audience peppered Mr. Cooper with questions, including one man who rose to describe how Enron had not only left many of them penniless but had also unfairly stigmatized them in the eyes of other employers. The crowd gave him a raucous cheer of support.
A day earlier, a help-wanted advertisement in The Houston Chronicle seemed to smack of blacklisting. The Houston unit of a financial printing and information management business, Bowne & Company, was inviting applicants for legal clerking positions to attend two job fairs, with specific exemptions. "No current or former employees of Enron, Arthur Andersen or the U.S. Government will be considered," the notice stated.
But a Bowne senior vice president, Joseph O. Miles, said the jobs involved working on a temporary, confidential assignment with Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm embroiled in the Enron scandal. He said the caveat was necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest, but that ex-Enron workers were eligible for other positions. 
"We deeply regret any misunderstanding regarding that job fair," he said.
Local headhunters say they have been inundated with Enron resumes and noted that, in general, finding a new job often takes several months or longer, particularly for higher-level positions. One new nonprofit organization, the Resource Alliance Group of Houston, has been formed to help former Enron workers start new businesses. 
Kathie Nordt, a headhunter who specializes in Internet technology, said most ex-Enron people have been well received but acknowledged that the corporation itself was resented by some other companies in town.
"There are a lot of people who were offended by the arrogance of Enron in the business world," Ms. Nordt said. Asked about a possible backlash against former workers, she said, "There may be a little bit of that."
As one former Enron employee who lives outside Texas put it, "The word Enron raises all kinds of negative things an employer might balk at." The former employee, who asked not to be named, is now a finalist for a job that would involve interaction with the media as well as with elected officials. He had no connection with or knowledge of the Enron scandal, but he said he could not escape it.
"They've told me directly that the one thing that I'll have to address about my background is the Enron factor," he said. "Either be prepared to defend it or at least understand that it is a factor that works against me."
Ms. Chapa, the software tester, had been recruited by Enron in December 2000 after spending two years as a software tester for a company doing research at the NASA space center in Houston. She had jumped at the offer because Enron doubled her salary and carried a cachet. Her resume was pretty slim, since she had spent 15 years raising her three children. Now the biggest name on that resume, Enron, is hurting her.
"A lot of recruiters will ask you exactly what you know about this fiasco," she said. "I don't know anything."
Enron was known for paying top salaries and awarding generous bonuses, a positive that suddenly looks like a negative to many employers and job recruiters. Ms. Chapa said one recruiter complained that Enron employees were spoiled by high salaries and added, "Nobody gave me a job when I lost my job."
Cheryl Kuehl, an administrative assistant for Enron Energy Services, is still jobless after six interviews. "They say, 'We don't know what was going on there, but you guys were very overpaid,' " Ms. Kuehl said. "I think that's because none can offer as much as Enron did."
She said she is willing to take less money, but that even those lower-paying jobs are in high demand. In December, she received several calls for interviews, but now the market is tighter. She interviewed for one clerical position that paid $10 an hour but found that seven other people were also interviewing.
"I made four times that amount at Enron," she said.
As yet, the impact of Enron's collapse on the overall Houston economy has been difficult to gauge. Mine Yucel, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said unemployment, when seasonally adjusted, had barely risen in Houston, to 5.2 percent in January from 5 percent in December. For all of 2001, unemployment rose 1.5 percent in the city.
"Houston is a huge economy," Ms. Yucel said. "Yes, 4,000 jobs is quite a lot and a big hit, but compared to the whole, the effect is not that big."
The reception of ex-Enron employees by other energy companies in Houston has been mixed. Enron's collapse had an effect on companies like Dynegy Inc., the El Paso Corporation and the Duke Energy Corporation when the industry was in the midst of a downturn and had slowed hiring. Executives at these companies have taken pains to try to distance themselves from Enron's aggressive corporate culture. But they are also doing some hiring, particularly for energy traders.
Terry Francisco, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company had received more than 700 resumes from former Enron workers and had hired 50. He said many of the new hires were "people who had a professional relationship with our traders, who had some knowledge of their work habits and professionalism."
Edward K. Mills, the president of Aquila Inc., an energy marketing company based in Kansas City, Mo., said his company had received scores of Enron resumes and had hired about 20 people, some in Europe and others in the United States. "We're looking for their 'A' players who can embrace our culture," he said.
Robert C. Green Jr., the chief executive of UtiliCorp United Inc., Aquila's corporate parent, expanded on that thought: "We don't think we know everything. It may have been the culture issue that got them in trouble."
Adrian Woolcock, 29, ran right into that sort of skepticism. He had joined Enron directly out of Rice University, and after losing his job at Enron had several interviews with energy companies in Houston. But he is now moving to a new job as a power trader in Minnesota. He said the energy companies in Houston were just too wary of his Enron ties.
"The constant theme was, 'What happened? Did you know? What were you doing over there?' " he said.

RACIAL INEQUALITY
By Glenn C. Loury.

 THE Martin Luther King holiday and Black History Month offer African-American intellectuals something like a season, not only a marketing device but also an occasion of some moment, a moment almost exclusively the creation of African-Americans themselves. (Blacks pushed for the King holiday, and the black historian Carter G. Woodson originated Negro History Week in 1926. It has since morphed into a month, a result of black advocacy.) 
On the other hand, there is something about this that smacks a bit of separate-but-equal, and something that seems to put African-American intellectuals in a ghetto that limits, in both subtle and blatant ways, what they can talk about and when it is best for them to do so. But in the United States it is probably better to have a niche one needs to rebel against than to have no niche at all, better, as James Baldwin suggested in 1955, to have a "special space in this scheme" than to "have no place in any scheme."
Three new books share the concern of race, of being "raced" as stigma, of blackness as a socially and politically compromised identity. But their approaches, through their subject matter and arguments, are quite energetically different.
Randall Kennedy's "Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word" has everything to make it popular: it is short, easy to read and provocative. But a book must be more than that to be good or to have been worth writing. On its face, the topic seems worthy. After all, Kennedy, a Harvard law professor, is writing about one of the most powerful obscene words ever invented. As he notes: "If nigger represented only an insulting slur and was associated only with racial animus, this book would not exist; rather, "nigger is fascinating precisely because it has been put to a variety of uses and can radiate a wide array of meanings."
But isn't this true of other obscene words? Would there be much profit in writing books about the history of one or another of them, using the word as the title to force self-respecting folk to say it if they wish to refer to the book? Maybe. But there is also something about these enterprises that seems a bit like urinating in the punchbowl at a fancy party or mooning in a church.
Kennedy starts out by giving us the history of the word nigger, challenging the view that it arose, in part, as a mispronunciation of Negro. As he makes clear, by the 1830's, when the abolitionist movement had become a significant political threat to the South, the word was unquestionably a racial insult. In fact, it became pervasive, with expressions like nigger hair (scouring pads), niggertoes (Brazil nuts), nigger hams (watermelons) and the like. It became an important part of white American humor in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is, of course, still used this way today, in some quarters. 
But Kennedy goes on to talk about other uses of the word, particularly among African-Americans, who employ it sometimes as an insult but often as a term of friendship and endearment or humor -- the way many black comedians, most famously Richard Pryor and Chris Rock, do -- and frequently in rap music. Its use in literature also comes up; indeed, as I remember, several works by black authors have nigger in the title: "Nigger" and "Up From Nigger," by Dick Gregory; "The Nigger Bible," by Robert H. deCoy; "Die, Nigger, Die," by H. Rap Brown; "The Nigger Factory," by Gil Scott-Heron; "The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger," by Cecil Brown; "The Electronic Nigger," by Ed Bullins.
Kennedy takes two strong positions throughout: he opposes any attempt to erase the word from the English language or to ban its use, and he opposes any ethnic-group ownership of the word. Anyone can use it. 
The second chapter, the strongest in the book, looks at the impact of the word in court cases of four sorts: defendants seeking to have convictions overturned because a criminal justice official connected with the case used the word; defendants seeking reduced punishment in cases where they assaulted or killed someone because they were provoked by the use of the word; complainants seeking damages under tort or antidiscrimination law because they were abused by the word; and cases in which judges must decide whether to inform jurors about whether witnesses or litigants have ever used it. On the the fighting-words defense, for instance, Kennedy's view is that "bright-line limits" shouldn't be applied to provocations. The jury should decide whether a defendant lost control, and if, therefore, punishment should be mitigated. But he supports the judge's decision in the O. J. Simpson case, that Detective Mark Fuhrman could be asked by the defense if he ever used the word. 
Kennedy then turns to the phenomenon of black overreaction, citing, among other examples, the exception taken to Quentin Tarantino's films, in which the word appears liberally; the uproar over the white city bureaucrat in Washington who said "niggardly" in the course of a budget discussion, which expression put him temporarily out of a job; and attacks on "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," which probably sets a record for the word's use in a literary work, 215 times.
Kennedy's book feels a bit like an inflated essay and a bit hastily composed. It is often engaging and informative, but the arguments don't seem quite telling or quite convincing. "The N-word is not self-defining," Kennedy writes. "Its actual meaning in any given instance always depends on surrounding circumstances." But isn't this true of other obscene words as well? The seeming multiplicity of uses of nigger is driven by its power as an insult, as an extraordinary stigmatizing word, a power that all speakers acknowledge and actually defer to, however they use the word. "Still," Kennedy says, "there is much to be gained by allowing people of all backgrounds to yank nigger away from white supremacists." 
But why is that better than having black people exercise the power of self-determination to eliminate the word or curtail its use? Does this word exist through some cultural necessity? Or perhaps we should rehabilitate all our cuss words and thus achieve our psychological salvation through rap stars, raunchy comedians and tart-tongued authors. Can stigma be destigmatized -- the true subject of Kennedy's book -- through making a word like nigger kinder and gentler? 
This is a real question, but I am not sure Kennedy answers it convincingly because in some ways he rather simplified the context of his inquiry. I think the subject would have better served had Kennedy done a broader study of racial or social blasphemy, or had he examined the word in connection with a study of what African-Americans have been called, both by themselves and by whites.
"The Envy of the World: On Being a Black Man in America," by the Newsweek columnist Ellis Cose, shares with "Nigger" the qualities of being short, easy to read and provocative. But Cose's book lacks an unsettling title. The phrase "envy of the world" was taken from a passage in Toni Morrison's 1973 novel, "Sula"; Cose's book is a journalist's report on the state of the black male (and black masculinity) at the start of the 21st century. "We begin by recognizing a simple fact: Though this may be the best time ever to be a black man in America (and here comes the all-important fine print), you only prosper if you make it through the gantlet," Cose writes. "Your best chance at life lies in rejecting what they -- what much of America -- tell you that you are." This quotation tells us two things: first, that Cose intends to offer his readers advice and, second, that his advice is largely how to deal with the stigma of being a black man. To the white public, "we are athletes, rappers, preachers, singers -- and precious little else." We are also robbers, rapists, mentally deficient and sexually well endowed. For Cose, the problem is that so many young black men have come to believe these ideas about themselves.
He opens with the stories of two black men who have achieved success in unexpected places, "slayers of stereotypes": Maurice Ashley, a grandmaster in chess, and Franklin Delano Raines, President Bill Clinton's director of the Office of Management and Budget and now the chief executive of Fannie Mae.
After this grand overture of inspiration and accomplishment, we get several chapters detailing the black male crisis. (Nearly all contemporary books on race and public affairs have crisis as their stock in trade, and thus often feel the same.) There is a chapter on masculinity and the street, where many black men accept a distorted view of masculine prowess. This view has been fed by the white media and white intellectuals like Norman Mailer, in, for example, his 1957 essay "The White Negro," as well as by the middle-class black fascination -- as old as the bourgeoisie itself -- with the lower class and the criminal as more authentic and anticonformist. So, black men seem nothing more than the personification of a criminal libido and creative psychopathology. 
Cose then goes on to detail the black male story in certain institutions: school (where we underachieve, in part, according to Cose, because we have internalized the stereotype that being smart is for white folk), prison (where a tragically high number of black men are now housed because of the illegal drug trade) and the family (where many black men seem to have failed in their responsibilities as fathers and husbands). 
Cose provides personal narratives, expert testimony and statistics as he blames the country for its failure to deal with many of these problems. He also reminds his reader that racism is far from dead. But in the end the advice he offers, like the analysis he performs, is largely personal, probably because he is aware that his black readers want to have their sense of agency reaffirmed. Sounding like a black version of Dr. Laura Schlessinger will make the book appealing. "The Envy of the World" is, finally, something of a self-help book, which gives it a manipulative, pontificating air. This is central to its appeal.
The left and the hard-core black nationalists will criticize Cose for not providing more of a structural analysis, and he will probably be accused of missing the implication of his own reporting; all the people he describes are working for organizations, however modest, that are trying to improve life for the black male. In other words, some will say that personal advice is beside the point; Cose's message should have been organize, organize and organize some more 
(A. Philip Randolph's mantra) and challenge the way things are ever more vigorously. In the end, Cose wishes simultaneously to alarm and to reassure his readers, to provide a pep talk and a jeremiad -- also standard features of contemporary race books by black authors.
Structural analysis is the meat of Glenn C. Loury's "Anatomy of Racial Inequality," the most intellectually rigorous and deeply thoughtful of these three books. Those familiar with Loury's career will remember that he made a splash with his doctoral dissertation, which helped promulgate the concept of social capital -- the web of connections and relationships that account for success as much as talent or money, the lack of which puts blacks at a competitive disadvantage; he later worked for the Reagan administration and became a formidable conservative critic of the so-called civil rights establishment. He has since parted ways with the conservatives, resigning from the American Enterprise Institute in 1995 over its support of Dinesh D'Souza's book "The End of Racism." There is much in Loury's career that brings to mind black intellectuals like George Schuyler and Amiri Baraka, both of whom were famous for dramatically changing their views in midstream and both of whom were temperamentally, like Loury, fiercely independent contrarians fiercely buffeted by ideology. 
"The Anatomy of Racial Inequality," as much as anything, might be considered Loury's declaration of independence, his fully articulated position as a neoliberal. Like "Nigger" and "The Envy of the World," Loury's book deals with racial stigma quite directly, but in its political and philosophical aspects as a cause of black disadvantage. "I endeavor to fathom the deeper causes of racial inequality so that, ultimately, I can assess the public morality of American social policy on this issue," Loury tells us. 
Loury carefully and intricately frames his argument (sometimes a bit repetitiously): that race is an important social convention, even if it has no scientific basis, and that it has been of undeniable importance in the distribution of rewards in the United States. Race as a category, in his view, is an expression of power, with one group being able to assign qualities or characteristics (stereotypes) to another and then have these qualities affirmed by the behavior of the stereotyped group through institutional structures designed to predict and confirm that behavior. What is worse for blacks is that the stereotype, because of the degradation and devaluation of their humanness under slavery and segregation, is a form of stigma or "spoiled identity." The effect lingers today and is, in fact, reinforced by social structures: this explains why blacks, despite advances, are still at the bottom on many social and economic indexes, and why traditional individual-based, colorblind liberalism will not solve the problem. 
Blacks were victimized by more than just procedural discrimination -- rather, by soul-crushing, psychological disfigurement. So what Loury ultimately argues for is a public policy that promotes racial egalitarianism. This sounds a great deal like the arguments of liberal sociologists in the 1940's and 50's that led to the Brown decision: a humane "damaged goods" theory about blacks. It is similar also to the rhetoric of Martin Luther King Jr., who argued for a Marshall Plan for racial equity. The moralizing tone of Loury's work -- why don't we care about the black poor? -- also sounds a great deal like the civil rights and liberal church rhetoric of the heady days of the Movement.
There are a few problems with Loury's book: first, he needs to tell us more about "the conservative line" than that it is "simplistic" and "ahistorical." In fact, the book needs to distinguish concisely between various forms of conservatism in the United States, their historical transformations and how these forms of conservatism have influenced American public policy on race. Perhaps a short but thorough critical overview of D'Souza's "End of Racism," the major conservative statement about racism and racial identity in American history, or "America in Black and White," by Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom, or Charles Murray's "Losing Ground," might have helped greatly. Conservatism, popularly understood, may be simplistic, ahistorical, even racist, but Loury owes it to his readers to argue this fully and not simply display a smug intellectual disdain or philosophical airiness. 
Second, I am not entirely convinced by Loury's separation of personal attitudes and social meaning: one has only to look at the transformation of jazz from a stigmatized music to a respected art form to see the vital connection between personal attitudes (of musicians and the audience) and social meaning (how and where this music was played and interpreted). 
Third, most blacks would agree with Loury's positions. (Some would probably wish that he would support formal reparations, which he does not.) Few would deny that structural racism impedes their progress and supports racial stigma; however, the idea of making it on our own is enormously appealing, deeply and richly historical and lies at the heart of strains of black nationalism that still resonate deeply in some black communities. As Ellis Cose knows, blacks want sermons about exercising agency, not elaborate analyses about how they are hopelessly stigmatized; there is something about "The Anatomy of Racial Inequality" that, like the philosopher's God, gives cold comfort to the faithful. Loury's plea for a more socially conscious public policy and "social vision" seems so earnest in its moral rectitude as to be almost quixotic. Why and how should white people's hearts and consciences change -- and Loury's hope depends a great deal on this -- if their general indifference is the cause of the problem? What would change them? Loury almost seems to be making a naive appeal to reason or moral suasion, which the very structures of the society he so tellingly describes would seem to limit, compromise or co-opt because, as he argues, personal attitudes have little effect on social meaning. Despite arguing itself into a cul-de-sac, "The Anatomy of Racial Inequality" is an incisive, erudite book by a major thinker.

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
String Players Young, Gifted And Black

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
I WANT to be the Tiger Woods of classical music," Gareth Johnson said recently. Classical music could use a Tiger Woods, no question, and Mr. Johnson may well fit the bill.
 A 16-year-old violinist from Wellington, Fla., he was between performances at the Sphinx Competition for black and Latino string players here, having won first prize in the junior division by playing a movement of Mozart's G major Concerto with finesse and flair. It seemed inconceivable that he had played the violin for only six years. 
 "I started at 10," he said. "I saw and heard someone play the violin and figured I'd like to do it. My parents said to hold off awhile, but I saved some money and bought a violin in a pawn shop for $80." 
The rest, though not yet history, may soon be. Mr. Johnson has prodigious musical gifts, good looks and a warm, winning personality. Like Joshua Bell or Maxim Vengerov, he projects a slightly cocky air in performance, which melts into a big, beaming grin; in short, he dominates a stage.
Mr. Johnson was one of 18 finalists in the Sphinx Competition. Another, Shelby Latin, a 20-year-old violinist in the senior division, played parts of the Tchaikovsky Concerto beautifully in a master class with the violist George Taylor, only to be told how to improve on them. She had a different though equally astounding tale to tell.
"I started when I was 1 1/2," she said. "Don't get me wrong, I was really big for my age." Ms. Latin is eager not only to play solo but also to explore chamber music and teaching.
"I don't want to tie myself down to one aspiration," she said. But she wants someday to start a music school.
Might Mr. Johnson or Ms. Latin want to play in an orchestra? Although neither volunteered as much, it is a primary goal of the Sphinx Organization to make membership in an orchestra seem not so much a fallback as a viable and attractive option in itself.
"I'm the last person who would say that any of our kids cannot be a soloist," said Aaron Dworkin, the 31-year-old president of Sphinx. "But we want to prepare them for the reality of the music world, and the reality is, most of them will not be soloists. We try to prepare them to just have a life in music. We tell them to pursue whatever it is they want to do, but also know the reality, and therefore know the reality of how much work you'll have to do. And know that that may not happen, and then you'll have these other options."
For members of certain minorities, an orchestral career could afford a ready opportunity to serve as a role model. Blacks and Latinos are woefully underrepresented in American orchestras.
Why is it, for example, that New Yorkers who annually become exercised by the absence of women in the Vienna Philharmonic rarely question why the New York Philharmonic has only one black player? In other cities, donors and the orchestras themselves have begun to sit up and take notice of similar deficiencies. Certainly the audiences the orchestras are avidly courting do. But so far, results have been limited.
Wounds are still fresh here at the Detroit Symphony; the Michigan legislature threatened in 1989 to withdraw state financing, which amounted to as much as $4.5 million a year, if the orchestra did not immediately add five blacks to the two it had. At the time, Deborah Borda -- now the managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and from 1991 to 1999 the executive director of the New York Philharmonic -- was the executive director in Detroit. She pre-emptively made a substitute player, a black double bassist, a permanent employee without recourse to auditions, causing a momentary firestorm that extended into the pages of The New York Times. But the unorthodox move ultimately defused the situation.
"I would do it again, absolutely," Ms. Borda said recently, though sounding shell-shocked by the incident even today. Detroit now has three black players and, each year, a black fellow: this year a bassoonist, for whom the orchestra has no permanent opening.
The Cleveland Orchestra, in its lofty perch in University Circle, far from the problems of the city center, began a period of soul-searching a number of years ago, setting up a task force on community relations. It heard complaints loud and quiet, like the one from a black woman who had held season tickets for 25 years but threatened to cancel because she was tired of waiting for the orchestra to add a third black musician.
The orchestra has been studying the issue of black hiring through a series of surveys. In one, it examined the makeup of 16 orchestras and found that a mere 1.6 percent of the players were black.
A broader survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League, conducted in the 1991-92 season and cited in Sphinx's literature, obtained similar results, finding that 1.6 percent of orchestral players are black, 1.5 percent Latino. (Definitions become difficult, especially at a time when institutions strain to protect the privacy of their employees and clients: by Sphinx's criteria, one or the other parent must be of black or Latino heritage.)
This reporter's own recent survey of 16 leading orchestras, employing 1,608 players in all, turned up 30 blacks (1.9 percent) and 27 Latinos (1.7 percent). Although all 16 orchestras registered in at least one category, two have no blacks (Chicago Symphony, San Francisco Symphony), and four have no Latinos (New York Philharmonic, Detroit Symphony, Dallas Symphony, Houston Symphony).
"There's a very small number of players," said Richard J. Bogomolny, the president of the Cleveland Orchestra, "and it doesn't do any good for us to steal three players from Detroit or another orchestra."
The problem, Mr. Bogomolny and others suggest, is in the pipeline. He explained that the Cleveland Orchestra and its personnel manager, Ralph Curry, a black cellist, have made strenuous efforts to find qualified black candidates for auditions but were unable to supply substantial numbers. That word "qualified" is crucial. No one on any side of these issues advocates a lowering of standards or seems to think it should be necessary, if educational opportunities are spread widely enough.
In another survey, the Cleveland Orchestra examined the feeder system, the major music schools and conservatories, and found that of 1,313 students working on orchestral instruments, 33 (2.5 percent) were black.
Not everyone sees a major problem here.
"Look at the number of black singers who have careers today," said Zarin Mehta, the executive director of the New York Philharmonic. "It's a question of who goes in to study the instruments of the orchestra. If people are not studying those instruments, then they don't care enough to want to be a part of an orchestra. The selection process gives absolutely equal opportunity. It's done on the basis of how well they play, and that's all there is to it."
It is perhaps not surprising that in the plugged-in culture of the 21st century, many children, white as well as black, shy away from seemingly antiquated pursuits like playing the violin. Asians and Asian-Americans evidently have no such qualms, and many have found the orchestra an ideal vehicle for advancement. 
Still, many professionals are deeply concerned about the black and Latino issue. "It's getting late for excuses," said Ms. Borda. Obviously, there are no ready solutions in a field where talent is best nurtured from the cradle up (despite the success of a relative latecomer like Mr. Johnson). Ms. Borda's orchestra in Los Angeles has four black players and two Latinos.
"We can't just fix it because we're of good will and we want it fixed," said Steven Monder, the president of the Cincinnati Symphony. "We have to be proactive about it."
Many orchestras, coming to the same realization, have created educational programs or partnerships with inner-city schools to drum up interest in classical music among minority children in the absence of school programs. The Boston Symphony has had notable success with its Project Step, which screens children in kindergarten and provides lessons for especially talented ones for up to 12 years. That project produced one of the Sphinx finalists this year, Mariana Green, a 23-year-old violinist living in New York.
Now the Boston Symphony and 19 other orchestras have entered into a partnership with Sphinx, even if it often means little more than presenting a competition winner as a concert soloist. "A big goal of ours," said Mr. Dworkin, "is to increase the numbers across the board, in audiences and in orchestras and in music schools and faculty, and hopefully, potentially as a soloist." Mr. Dworkin, himself black and a violinist, has taken on a Herculean task.
"When Aaron approached me with his idea seven years ago, I thought it would be absolutely impossible to pull off something like this in less than a quarter of a century," Willis Patterson, a former associate dean of the School of Music at the University of Michigan, told a Sphinx gathering here. "As I look back, I still think it's impossible."
Mr. Dworkin was born in upstate New York in 1970 (on the newly infamous Sept. 11) and was adopted and raised in Manhattan. (He recently located his biological parents after a lifelong search, and his birth mother attended the competition along with his adoptive parents.) When he was 5, he heard his mother, an amateur violinist, play solo works by Bach. "I just loved it," he said, "and I picked it up right away."
The family moved to Hershey, Pa., when he was 10, and he finished high school at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan. After leaving Penn State University for financial reasons and gaining four years' entrepreneurial experience in support for the homeless, in retail sales promotion and in publishing, he earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Michigan. He founded Sphinx in 1996, while finishing graduate studies in Ann Arbor.
"Obviously, in all of the musical situations that I've been in, from New York to Hershey to . . . everywhere, I was either the only minority or one of less than a handful," he said. "Returning after four years off, I started thinking about that a lot more, and what could be done about it. So, out of that came this idea of how to increase the representation of minorities in the audience and onstage, and I thought a competition would be a good vehicle."
But this is by no means a typical competition. It is calculated to bring the contestants together rather than divide them. They attend concerts and seminars together and combine to play chamber music. The environment is nurturing. "Our mantra is, we apply the same requirements to them that the professional world will," Mr. Dworkin said, "but we explain to them what's happening while it's happening."
The organization grew over the years to include other activities and a year-round program. It now finds scholarships for the finalists at summer schools and festivals, arranges community concerts in Michigan and performances in elementary schools around the country, and presents a recital series at Borders bookstores. It has also set up an instrument fund to allow the players to perform on excellent instruments.
"Good instruments can make all the difference in auditions," Ms. Borda said. One Sphinx finalist this year, Eric Thompson III, an 18-year-old double bassist from Decatur, Ga., won third prize in the junior division on an instrument that may or may not have seen better days. Happily, his mentor, Ralph Jones, the principal bass player of the Atlanta Symphony, is helping Mr. Thompson arrange financing for a new instrument.
Sphinx assembles a fine orchestra of black and Latino professionals from orchestras across the nation for the competition. The conductor here was Leslie B. Dunner, and the concertmaster was Sanford Allen, the New York Philharmonic's lone black member.
This year, the organization also commissioned a work for the competition, "Symphony of the Sphinx," by Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson to a text by Nikki Giovanni.
All these activities are accomplished on a shoestring. The Sphinx Organization has an annual budget of $750,000: $260,000 in in-kind contributions (summer scholarships, hotel rooms, instruments provided on loan) and $490,000 in cash. Even that small amount is increasingly hard to come by.
"We are not on secure footing, and the reason is twofold," Mr. Dworkin said. "One, just the overall economy. We're at that emerging-nonprofit point, and we just can't compete with the Detroit Symphony and other institutions for funding. Second, we are at the end of a three-year commitment from Texaco. Texaco has been bought by Chevron, and that has put how we might move forward in question. So we're entering into a new economic environment and losing a quarter of our budget at the same time."
There are almost no donations from individuals, in part because the staff is too small to do the necessary groundwork. It consists of three people: Mr. Dworkin; his wife, Carrie A. Dworkin, the director of communications; and Afa Sadykhly, the artistic director. Only its achievements are large.
 SPHINX has really changed my life," Patrice Jackson, a 19-year-old cellist from New Haven, said, even before she won the senior competition. (She competed in the junior division in 1999.)
"I can't express how it is to learn that you're not alone, that there are other African-Americans your age doing the same thing," she explained. "My goal is to be the first African-American soloist on the cello. I want to keep my options open. I want to be able to do everything."
As with Tiger Johnson, you probably don't want to bet against her.

HEADLINE: A New Governor Works Out The Kinks 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA FITZGERALD 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
IN the lonely hours before dawn, there is a good chance that Gov. James E. McGreevey is poring over papers, punching numbers into his cell phone and living the mantra dictated by his father, a Marine drill instructor: Plan your work and work your plan.
 That explains why after a recent day when legislators failed to move some of his main budget proposals out of committee, Mr. McGreevey called one young aide at 4:30 the next morning to schedule visits to the Democrat and Republican legislative caucuses. 
 "I see myself as a C.E.O," he said in a recent interview. "I'm very hands on. Most would say to a fault. I'm not going to change. It's what I am and what I've done my whole life. The importance is to be hands on. The critical decision is to know what to be hands on about." 
This sort of micromanaging seemed to work for Mr. McGreevey when he was mayor of Woodbridge, a township of 97,000 with a budget of $80 million. Now, however, he is one of the more powerful of the nation's governor's in a state with more than 8 million residents that is facing its biggest fiscal crisis in balancing a $23 billion budget.
The question is whether the state -- and a divided Legislature -- will adapt to his style or whether he is going to modify his approach to get what he wants done.
In truth, electing James E. McGreevey was like getting two governors for the price of one because his work days and schedules are so densely packed. One of the things he says he most enjoys about his new job is meeting with leaders in business, government, science and technology to discuss the pressing issues of the day. Those who knew Mr. McGreevey as a bachelor recall days at the shore when he could be found off by himself reading about politics or management.
He is already poised to become a significant voice in the national debate over education. Some advocates say he has done more in his first month in office to ensure that less-advantaged students in New Jersey get a good education -- creating an early literacy task force, setting aside $40 million for reading coaches and creating a new council to implement rather than fight court-ordered reforms in disadvantaged schools -- than the previous administration did in two terms. And he is determined to make cancer research -- a topic of pressing concern in a state with the most Superfund sites in the nation and a cancer cluster in Toms River that has primarily affected children -- a major focus of his administration.
But as Jimmy Carter learned during his one term as president, there is a danger of becoming too enmeshed in details and losing the overall focus, particularly when it comes to dealing with the Legislature. Unlike his predecessor, Christie Whitman, Governor McGreevey's party does not control both chambers. While Democrats maintain a 44-36 advantage in the Assembly, the Senate is evenly divided 20-20. Nor does it help that some lawmakers see Mr. McGreevey's tenure as a state legislator as largely unremarkable; they are now finding it difficult to take orders from a man they had viewed as a backbencher.
As a candidate, his success was in uniting various and opposing forces into a single McGreevey-for-governor-coalition. Now he finds himself with the unenviable job of trying to keep those factions satisfied, a task dd made especially difficult in light of the state's projected $6 billion budget deficit next year. Indeed, he is already running into problems.
Some legislators say Mr. McGreevey is still in a campaign mode, and point to the fact that his main campaign consultants -- Steve DeMicco and Brad Lawrence -- have been retained to polish his speeches. For their part, Republicans are incensed that he has constantly blamed them for the state's severe budget problems. And some Democrats are irked because they say he has failed to keep them informed of major appointments, initiatives or budget cuts, causing some embarrassment when the news comes without warning.
The more political capital Mr. McGreevey squanders through partisan rhetoric and lack of communication, lawmakers say, the less he will have in reserve to push his political initiatives through the Legislature.
"This is a collaborative effort," said one Democratic consultant. "He doesn't have the kind of padding with a super majority in the Legislature to just dictate what he wants to get done. He can't afford to have everybody mad at him."
Mr. McGreevey does not see it that way.
"I am among the least partisan individuals," he said. "Fiscally, I'm a moderate if not a conservative. So I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis. When I ran in Woodbridge, if only Republicans voted, I would have won."
There is also a sense that Mr. McGreevey is not always effective at communicating with some political supporters when unpleasant news arises. While the slights might not cause him much harm initially, it might make it easier for some lawmakers to turn against him should he start to lose public support.
The most obvious example involves Joe Doria, the powerful Hudson County Democrat who led his party in the Assembly for the past 10 years. Though Mr. Doria said that Mr. McGreevey pledged to support him for the post of Assembly speaker, after the election Mr. McGreevey instead backed a relative newcomer, Assemblyman Albio Sires.
Then there was the Senate Democratic leader, Richard Codey, who was under the impression last fall that Mr. McGreevey was going to name Michael Rowe -- a former president of the New Jersey Nets and his own choice -- as chief executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. Instead, the governor selected George Zoffinger, chairman and chief executive of Constellation Capital Corp. in New Brunswick. Mr. Codey said that the governor later explained that the situation had changed since they had spoken in November, but Mr. Codey was still miffed that he was never told that Mr. Rowe was out before Mr. Zoffinger's name was made public.
Others are upset that Mr. McGreevey appears to be trying to install Charles Kushner, his single largest campaign contributor, as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Some Democrats thought the job had already been promised to Jack Sinagra, a retired Republican state senator and close ally of John Lynch, the influential Democratic chairman of Middlesex County.
In South Jersey, lawmakers initially appeared to be out of the loop because they had no idea that steep budget cuts to their districts were coming before they were announced. The reductions included $3.5 million in aid to the former battleship New Jersey, which is now a floating museum, $9 million for a Salem County sewer treatment plant and $300,000 for the Boys and Girls Club of Camden County.
Lawmakers are not the only ones irked these days.
There are also an increasing number of complaints from reporters that Governor McGreevey's office is not as responsive to the news media as previous governors. The State House press corps says that there have already been many occasions when repeated phone calls are not returned and that in the course of a day it is difficult to find out exactly what the governor's position is on specific issues.
One reporter who complained that a budget briefing -- a meeting where budget cuts are explained -- should not have been off the record was told that the next time he would not be invited. He responded that he was representing the public and had a right to be there. The governor's office corrected him: "Jim McGreevey represents the public. You just represent your shareholders."
To be sure, some complaints are the inevitable result of an administration in its infancy as the new managers learn to cope with the myriad demands put on the governor's office.
To be sure, some complaints are the inevitable result of an administration in its infancy as the new managers learn to cope with the myriad demands put on the governor's office. But administration officials say more staff members are being hired, and the problems with the media should soon abate.
Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, which conducts research on state issues, and a former spokesman for Gov. Jim Florio, said that there were bound to be bumps in the road when any new governor took office and that judgments now were premature. "As a reporter, I remember writing stories about how Tom Kean was destined to be a one-term governor," Mr. Shure said.
For his part, Mr. McGreevey said he was aware of the complaints and was working on addressing them, adding, "We can always do better."
During the campaign, Mr. McGreevey went out of his way to try to please everyone, a trait that is part of his political nature. As a political survivor, his record is nearly flawless. First he trounced Representative Rob Andrews, the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1997, and nearly upset the incumbent, Mrs. Whitman, in the general election. Then he muscled Senator Robert Torricelli out of the way when it seemed as if Mr. Torricelli was out to grab the 2001 nomination from him, although some credit Mr. Lynch with the political maneuvering. 
Governor McGreevey said he understood the role of mayor was vastly different than that of governor, and that he had been making the transition ever since he was defeated by Mrs. Whitman. "Losing in 1997 was a blessing," he said. "It provided me with an opportunity to begin to shift that focus. I would not have been anywhere near as prepared as I am today."
After he lost, Mr. McGreevey said he began to educate himself on how other states were dealing with difficult issues like education in the event he decided to run again.
As mayor, Mr. McGreevey routinely toured neighborhoods on garbage pickup days to make sure that haulers had put the lids back on the cans, or drove around at night to see if all the street lights were on.
"With all due respect, that's why you win with 83 percent of the vote," he said.
As governor his priorities, of course, have shifted. Accountability is paramount, but "obviously" he adds, it's not about garbage pickup anymore. 
"There are three relatively straightforward directives," Mr. McGreevey said of his job during his first term as governor. "That state government lives within its means, educational excellence and the security and safety of our families and neighborhoods."
To help him achieve those goals, he has surrounded himself with four top aides who are charged with hammering out his plans on a daily basis: Gary Taffet, chief of staff; James Davy, chief of management and operations; Paul Levinsohn, his chief counsel, and Jo Astrid Glading, his chief of communications and policy.
Mr. Taffet and Mr. Davy worked with Mr. McGreevey in Woodbridge, while Mr. Levinsohn and Ms. Glading came on board during the campaign. Today the four serve as the governor's political and managerial arms. Yet while they have served in government, there is little collective experience in running the state's top executive office. 
"He's got a good staff, but they are young," said former Gov. Tom Kean. "They'll be learning together."
For their part, the four top aides are already used to the governor's hectic schedule. As Mr. Taffet put it: "There is only one pace. All out."
Mr. McGreevey is a man who considers work a recreational sport, even more so now that he is recuperating from a broken leg and unable to run his customary five miles a day. Confined to a hospital bed in his living room at night, he says he is rising earlier, his mind buzzing with thoughts about the day. 
Then there is what some close to the young governor him describe as a temperamental nature, a mix of combustible ire leavened with a self-deprecating wit.
As the governor's chief of staff, Mr. Taffet has the toughest job in the administration, and one that historically sends people packing after about two years.
The 35-year-old Mr. Taffet, who was Mr. McGreevey's chief aide in Woodbridge, is "exceptionally bright, able and understands political considerations," the governor said. "Literally, there is no one better. He operates almost flawlessly and he understands the legislative process. He is particularly good at it whereas I am not. I am more the executive branch."
Returning the compliment, Mr. Taffet said the governor could be a demanding boss but one that brought out the best and the most creative side of an employee.
"He's challenging and motivates the staff up to the next level," Mr. Taffet said.
Mr. McGreevey said the 48-year-old Mr. Davy, his chief of operations, is "the best manager I've ever encountered" and that "he has a phenomenal ability to set clear objectives."
Yet Mr. Davy's role, in which he also serves as a sort of manager of the state's many departments, is one that has the potential to stifle some of an individual cabinet member's power and influence.
"Cabinet members and commissioners typically prefer as a condition of acceptance to their position a pledge of direct access to the governor," said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University. "They don't like to have their views and interests filtered by a staff member. The governor is going to have to monitor that carefully."
As for Ms. Glading, his communications and policy director, Mr. McGreevey said she "serves as a conscience" reminding him of the moral and ethical obligations of budget cuts and other issues. He said she had a "tremendous sense of intuition" and that he valued her analytical skills. 
And his chief counsel, Mr. Levinsohn, 33, was described by the governor as "literally among my closest personal friends."
"I value his integrity, decency, acuity and his ability to say 'no' to me," he said.
The advice often goes unheeded.
"When he tells me why I can't do something," the governor joked, "it ensures I'll be more passionate about getting it done."
A second tier of staff members, whom some have criticized as owing their jobs to political cronyism, function as Mr. McGreevey's advisors or "point people." These include Golan Cipel, a 33-year-old Israeli, a former campaign aide who has been hired as the governor's counterterroism expert; Lucille Davy, the wife of James Davy; Curtis Fischer, a former director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group; Beth Sztuk, a former deputy director of the Economic Development Authority; and Mitch Ostrer, an attorney.
Yet Mr. McGreevey has been criticized for having multiple layers of managers at a time when he has vowed to make state government run more efficiently.
Defending his coterie of young advisers, the governor said: "These individuals have been hired because of their intellectual capital, their prowess. Mitchell Ostrer is literally one of the brightest human beings I've had the pleasure of knowing, but to ask him a political question would be an absurdity."
The governor is also a fan of special advisory boards -- mini think tanks -- to develop ideas and solutions for such overarching issues as the budget and education.
While some think it makes decision-making cumbersome, the governor likes the input. 
"Governor McGreevey has always maintained the unique ability to engender participation from the corporate community and meld those ideas with his own staff advisors and ultimately develop his own positions," Mr. Taffet said. "He's very engaged and hands-on in the process. He is a strong believer that we must tap into those resources."
To that end, Mr. McGreevey also looks to two former governors -- Tom Kean, a Republican, and Brendan Byrne, a Democrat -- for practical advice. Mr. Lynch, his political mentor, also exerts a great deal of influence in sorting out decisions. And his father, while perhaps not an influence, certain remains a presence.
"I've been doing what I consider to be important," Governor McGreevey said. "That is not necessarily what the press thinks is important, what bureaucracy thinks is important or the Legislature thinks is important. But I need to develop the structural foundations for four years."
He added: "The point is not to worry about the day, not to necessarily over-engage in a mythical 100-day sprint . . . but to set the structural underpinnings for the long term and not to be overly concerned with the political skirmish of the day. You know, this too shall pass."
Governor McGreevey said he saw his job as "understanding the importance of the greater good, creating the structural foundations for a state government" and to move forward his focus on balancing the budget, improving education and making the state more secure "on a concurrent, consistent and measured basis."
And as he stretched out on a chair in the solarium of the governor's mansion in Princeton, with the sun rising behind his back and the view of impeccably manicured grounds and gardens stretching lazily behind him, he added, almost as an afterthought, "and to enjoy life."

What's That Rumble In Venture Capital Funds?

BYLINE:  By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
VENTURE capital and other private equity investors, generally known for their patient long-term outlook, are getting more than a little restless. Increasingly, they want to escape the heavy capital commitments they made at the height of the technology investing frenzy. Some are suing to recover losses.
 An outbreak of litigation in this relatively closed world is one clear sign of investor frustration over the tens of billions of dollars that have been committed but not put to use. 
 The mood contrasts sharply with that of the long bull march of the 1980's and 90's, when venture capitalists and their investors earned an average of more than 18 percent a year by selling stakes in companies they had nurtured to technology-hungry public and corporate buyers. 
But with initial public offerings now scarce and with the stock market soured on technology, tensions are rising between the general partners who run private equity funds and their limited partners -- the banks, endowments, pension funds and millionaires who supply most of their capital.
Limited partners have grown impatient over both poor performance and high management fees. Perhaps more significant, many limited partners now say venture capital firms are sitting on far more capital than they can invest profitably. With the air out of technology valuations and no fashionable investment themes, the industry has $75 billion of uninvested capital, according to Venture Economics, a unit of Thomson Financial that tracks venture capital data. That amount easily exceeds total venture investment from 1990 to 1998.
The manager of one large university endowment on the East Coast, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was particularly angry that some venture capital firms had asked him and other limited partners to back companies that had been assigned rich valuations but were now worth much less. "They raised too much capital," the manager said. "They paid too much for the deals." 
Some general partners acknowledge the tension with limited partners. "There are some limited partners who feel venture capitalists drove hard bargains on the way up," said C. Kevin Landry, the chief executive of TA Associates, a large venture capital firm in Boston. "Now the pendulum is swinging the other way." 
Because venture partnerships are largely free of public disclosure requirements, most disputes have been settled privately, with partner agreements that dictate confidentiality. Venture capitalists, recently lionized as catalysts of technological advancement and economic productivity, are typically reluctant to concede that their investors have grown edgy as their portfolio values have shrunk. But it will be tough to conceal disputes as some boil over into litigation.
In January, a group of minority investors that includes Dell Computer and the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology mutual fund filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Idealab Inc., the once-heralded venture incubator. Another minority investor, the William Morris Agency Inc., joined the lawsuit last week. Accusing Bill Gross, Idealab's chairman and chief executive, of mismanagement, the plaintiffs, who have seen half of their roughly $1 billion investment disappear in the smoke of dot-bombs like eToys and Eve.com, want Idealab liquidated and its remaining assets disbursed. Mr. Gross is fighting the lawsuit.
"The Idealab case suggests there could be more litigation to come," said Carl E. Metzger, an authority on litigation risk in private equity, and a partner at the Boston law firm of Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault.
Last week, the treasurer of Connecticut, Denise L. Nappier, who manages $20 billion in pension plans and trust funds for the state, sued Forstmann Little & Company, seeking to recover more than two-thirds of the state's $200 million investment, which she contends has been handled improperly. Forstmann Little has vowed to fight the suit. 
Litigation is only the most public form of contention between general and limited partners. Many limited partners are prodding general partners to release them from some share of their pledged commitments, cajoling them to reduce management fees and, with increasing frequency and sometimes with desperation, unloading their venture stakes at discounts in a bustling secondary market. 
Not all limited partners are unhappy. Having enjoyed a long run of superior returns, some are philosophical about high prices paid as the market peaked. "I sat down and negotiated a deal. A deal's a deal," said Gary Bruebaker, chief investment officer of the Washington State Investment Board, which manages $53.7 billion.
BUT others are asking general partners, "What have you done for me lately?" Venture investments have produced negative returns, on average, for five consecutive quarters, and distribution of profits to limited partners has slowed to a trickle, according to Venture Economics.
Because many venture capital firms have been slow in writing down the value of their assets, the red ink is bound to thicken. "There's more carnage to come," said Michael D. Granoff, chief executive of Pomona Capital, a private equity investment firm in New York.
Some limited partners say funds are much too large, given the absence of any "next big thing" opportunities, and want to be let off the hook for some of the capital they have pledged. Connecticut has sought release from $475 million in private equity commitments and has been obliged with the return of more than $160 million, Ms. Nappier said. 
Alfred J. Giuffrida, managing director at Horsley Bridge, a private equity investor in San Francisco, said he had asked two funds in which it is a limited partner to reduce their size, and, as a result, individual commitments. Mr. Giuffrida said he was turned down in one case but successful in the other. 
The manager of a large university endowment in the Bay Area, who asked not to be identified, said he had held discussions with a number of funds about cutting back. 
But general partners say they have no legal obligation to release limited partners from their commitments. Besides, downsizing can look like an acknowledgment of error. And many general partners contend that the markets are only cyclically weak, with promising investment opportunities just around the corner. 
Additionally, management fees charged by general partners are typically based on the volume of capital commitments. Bloated fund size, however, could hurt general partners later if it tempts them to chase weak investment opportunities. Rob Chaplinsky, a general partner at Mohr, Davidow Ventures in Menlo Park, Calif., says the important question is this: "What's the right size fund to generate the highest return?"
Mohr, Davidow recently released limited partners from 20 percent of their commitments as it downsized an $850 million fund to $675 million. Matthew T. Cowan, a general partner at BayStar Capital in San Francisco, said he thought more venture capital firms would have to follow suit. "You're going to see fund size shrink," he said. 
Limited partners have been especially irritated by annual management fees, which can exceed 2 percent of committed capital even if it has not yet been invested. One firm that has responded to complaints, according to several limited partners, is ComVentures of Palo Alto, Calif., which recently lowered its fees from 2.5 percent to 2 percent. ComVentures, citing a confidentiality agreement with its limited partners, declined to comment. 
Limited partners are bracing for more bad news as general partners write down the value of their portfolios. Many venture funds have been slow to do so, even though such adjustments would reflect the market path of technology stocks in the last two years. Funds have little incentive to hurry the write-downs, and some have reason to postpone them. Accounting rules governing the speed of such write-downs are vague, and some venture fund management fees are tied to the values of these assets.
Still, there is an awful lot of writing down to do. Venture Economics has reported that the value of venture assets in the four quarters ended Sept. 30, its most recent data, fell by 32 percent. That compares with a 60 percent decline over the same period for the Nasdaq market, which is heavy with young technology stocks backed by the venture capital industry.
The comparison suggests that the worst is yet to come in asset write-downs. "We're going to see another four quarters of downward valuation," said Peter Lawrence, a managing partner with Flag Venture Management, a private equity investment firm in Stamford, Conn.
The slow write-down pace could open new doors to litigation. "Venture capital firms face legal exposure for failure to mark down the value of their private equity holdings in timely fashion," Mr. Metzger, the Boston lawyer, said. 
Potential litigants may include secondary-market buyers of limited partners' stakes, as well as limited partners like pension funds that may plan payments to pensioners based on unrealistic valuations.
Whether displeased with their investments or just needing cash, many limited partners are looking to sell their venture stakes. Although general partners have veto power over proposed sales and are understandably eager to maintain a stable investor base, turnover is rising. Banks, including J. P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America, have been sellers. Wider bank selling is expected because the Federal Reserve is tightening cash reserve requirements on the private equity investments of banks. 
But with so much uncertainty over portfolio value, many who want to sell cannot find buyers. Timothy Jones, investment director at Coller Capital, a London-based buyer in the secondary market, forecasts $4 billion to $5 billion in secondary-market sales this year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2001. But he also estimated that $20 billion in assets would be available for sale this year, which leaves "people with $15 billion or more in assets that can't find buyers."

HEADLINE: The Uses of American Power 

 BODY:
If Congress cranks up the Pentagon's budget as much as President Bush would like, the United States will soon be spending more on defense than all the other countries of the world combined. That is just one measure of America's armed might -- and a global imbalance of power the likes of which has probably not been seen since the height of the Roman empire. While the United States is used to regarding itself as a global power, and its status as the sole superpower has steadily grown since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming disparity is still a big change. So is the country's willingness to exercise its power in the wake of Sept. 11. Before President Bush decides where next to take the war against terrorism, he and the American people ought to pause for a moment to think about how we intend to behave in this new and awesome role. 
 The advantages of being an unchallengeable military superpower are obvious. The opponents will not always be as easily routed as the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan, and some conflicts are certain to produce many more casualties on all sides, but American might dwarfs the capacity of almost any foe we may face in the war against terrorism. And we have learned that there are instances when the use of force is necessary. Sept. 11 taught us what harm can come from complacency and inaction in the face of cold-blooded enemies determined to destroy the United States. 
 But in a high-tech world, even a superpower cannot protect itself without the help of other countries. Much of the world already resents the United States because of its size and wealth. Even our allies hate being made to feel as if they live on a planet in which only one country's opinion matters. The biggest challenge for the United States is not how to win the next military encounter, but how to conduct itself so that other nations willingly accept its leadership.
The most effective way to make other countries comfortable with American military power is to demonstrate that the United States has their best interests at heart, too. They will not be impressed by the offer of a kind of Pax Americana, in which Washington makes the world safe for everyone on its own terms. The United States must buy into the goals that its allies and potential allies have already identified as important. That includes making inroads against poverty, infectious disease and malnourishment around the globe, undermining dictatorships with education and development, and curbing both the spread of horrific unconventional weapons and the dangers of global warming.
The opportunities today are great. America's relations with Russia are more promising than they have been in decades, China's leaders are newly eager to advertise their friendship, ties with India have notably warmed, and Pakistan, after a long estrangement, is again an important ally of the United States. Even in a recession, America is the world's economic engine. Its return to health will set the pace for Europe's recovery and China's continued development.
The power of American arms, impressive as it is, has limits. Military action is only part of the foreign policy equation, as current developments in Afghanistan illustrate. Washington still expects other nations to participate in such vital tasks as economic reconstruction and peacekeeping and to help confer diplomatic and political legitimacy on governments secured by American military action. For those practical reasons, the interests of other countries cannot be ignored. A stable world order must be built on a broad international consensus, not American military action alone.

Optimism Weakens On Accounting Worries

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer

 BODY:
Investor optimism declined sharply in February, largely because of concerns about accounting problems raised by the collapse of the Enron Corporation, according to a survey conducted for UBS.
 The survey found that optimism declined 20 percent from the first two weeks in January to the first two weeks in February. 
The survey, of 1,001 people, has been conducted by the Gallup Organization during the first two weeks of each month since October 1996. 
 Nearly 90 percent of those polled said they were familiar with the Enron debacle and with the company's accounting irregularities. Seventy-nine percent said accounting problems are hurting the investment climate in the United States, and 62 percent said they believed that dubious accounting was widespread in American business. 
"Despite an improving earnings outlook, the drop in optimism clearly shows that investors are affected by the Enron bankruptcy and the ongoing questions it raises about corporate accounting practices," said Mary Farrell, senior investment strategist at UBS PaineWebber. 
The investors, on average, said they expected stock market returns over the next 12 months to be 9.5 percent, down from 10.2 percent in the survey the previous month. Expected returns among investors under the age of 40 rose to 13.2 percent from 10.3 percent. In contrast, expectations among investors over 40 declined to 8.4 percent from 10.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Quickly, a Saudi Peace Idea Gains Momentum in Mideast 

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 2 

 BODY:
After rapidly gaining momentum through the Middle East and Europe since its soft launching two weeks ago, the Saudi Arabian peace idea will descend on Washington when the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, comes calling on Tuesday.
 At week's end, Vice President Dick Cheney will be heading for the Middle East, where, whatever his original agenda may have been, he is certain to be badgered relentlessly for some sign of American interest in the initiative, which comes during some of the worst violence to engulf the region in years. 
 As if to hammer home the menace, a bomb exploded this evening on a street in Jerusalem crowded with Orthodox Jews returning from prayers, killing at least nine people. 
In the West Bank, Israeli troops, backed by armor and helicopters, took the war to a new front, raiding congested Palestinian refugee camps in Jenin and Nablus this week in search of militants and arms caches.
Israeli officials said at least 30 Palestinians and two Israelis were killed. 
The Mubarak and Cheney missions are only part of the swirl that has developed around the unexpected proposal that the crown prince and effective ruler of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah, first made in an interview with a New York Times columnist on Feb. 17. Prince Abdullah suggested that the Arab world would offer Israel full normalization of relations in exchange for its withdrawal from all occupied territories. He said he had intended to ask the entire 22-nation Arab League to join in the offer at its summit meeting in Beirut on March 27 and 28.
Though the fate of the endeavor is far from certain, the speed with which it has swelled from a little-noted idea in a newspaper column into a serious force in the Middle East reflects the despair and the dangers that the conflict has spread through the region, and the longing to seize on anything that might point to a way out. 
Skeptics -- including some in the Bush administration -- initially gave the floated proposals short shrift. It was not really an initiative, they suggested, but at best a nice idea. It was not new. It was basically a public relations gambit by the Saudis to polish their tarnished image in the United States. It would raise dangerous expectations. The Arabs would never follow through, the Israelis would never agree. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell at first said it was one of some "minor developments that we might be able to work on."
But with Israelis and Palestinians in a state of despair over ever finding peace after 17 months of unrelenting conflict, and with the Bush administration seemingly determined not to get embroiled, the Saudi proposal brought a long-absent gleam of hope. 
It is not only the timing that gave the initiative its impetus. It was also the fact that it came from Saudi Arabia, the richest and most influential Arab state, and the hallowed home of Islam's two most sacred shrines. 
From this grand pulpit, Crown Prince Abdullah spoke not only of diplomatic recognition, not only of peace, but of a "full normalization of relations."
That meant the fulfillment of a dream most Israelis had all but abandoned: "economic and cultural cooperation; falafel in Damascus and stalls in the international market of Dubai; an Israeli flag in Riyadh, programming engineers in Bahrain and gas from Qatar," as Zvi Bar'el, the Middle East analyst for the Haaretz newspaper, sketched the vision.
"I wanted to find a way to make clear to the Israeli people that the Arabs don't reject or despise them," the crown prince told Thomas L. Friedman, the New York Times columnist. "But the Arab people do reject what their leadership is now doing to the Palestinians, which is inhumane and oppressive."
The idea went unnoticed at first. But then some commentators, experts and diplomats picked it up, the Israeli press began to pay heed, and before long senior officials were reacting seriously. Arab, European and United Nations diplomats began scurrying from capital to capital, many of them knocking on Prince Abdullah's door in search of confirmation and explanation.
Finally President Bush took heed. He telephoned Prince Abdullah to welcome the Saudi proposal, then dispatched George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, and William J. Burns Jr., assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, to the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, was also said to be skeptical about the plan, but as Israelis seized on the glimmer of hope, he signaled that he was quietly exploring it even as the battles raged. 
The Palestinians openly greeted the initiative. A senior Palestinian official, Nabil Shaath, went off to Jidda over the weekend to see the crown prince, following on the heels of Javier Solana, the European Union commissioner for foreign affairs, and the American team.
Amr Moussa, the secretary general of the Arab League, toured Arab capitals to gauge attitudes in advance of the Arab summit meeting. The mission was critical, since the Arab League works through consensus, and the presumption was that Prince Abdullah could keep his speech in the drawer, where it was when Mr. Friedman called on him, unless it was guaranteed acceptance by all the Arabs.
But in the coming week all eyes will be on Washington. There is an almost universal sense in the Middle East that it is now the United States, the Bush administration, that has to breathe life into the Saudi idea. The Israelis and Palestinians have lost any shred of mutual trust; Mr. Sharon is not likely to budge except under American prodding, and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, is grounded by the Israelis in Ramallah.
"If the United States assumes the primary role, it will give the process great credibility and effectiveness," Prince Abdullah told Time magazine, adding, "If the U.S. has no desire to contribute to this, it should let others do it."
Mr. Arafat also expressed his hope, in an interview with The New York Times this week, that President Bush "will complete this very international, historical initiative."
"For this there must be a very important and very strong and very quick push from outside," the Palestinian leader said, giving as an example the pressure Mr. Bush's father had exerted on Yitzhak Shamir, an earlier Israeli hard-line prime minister, to attend the 1991 Madrid conference on the Middle East. 
That is also the message that the Egyptian president will press on Mr. Bush when he meets him on Tuesday. 
Mr. Mubarak has been relatively reserved about the Saudi initiative in public, but according to experts on the region, he and King Abdullah of Jordan -- leaders of the only two Arab countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel -- were involved with the Saudi crown prince as his idea took shape.
"If that idea goes to the Arab summit, and it is endorsed in a language well written and well formulated to cover not only the Palestinian lands but the Golan, then the Israelis will have to respond, and the Americans will have to activate a process," said Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, the Egyptian ambassador to the United Nations, referring also to the disputed Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 war. 
"Now it is the moment of truth," Mr. Aboul-Gheit said. "The Arabs are coming forward saying 'land for peace' -- a concept the Americans embraced 10 years ago. The situation has to move forward, because we have seen 9/11, we have seen the results of intifada, the anger the Arab and Islamic world is feeling."

The Genesis
A Proposal Born Of Arab Frustration
A Saudi push for peace, as the experts were quick to point out after Prince Abdullah discussed his proposal, is not unprecedented. In 1981, the crown prince at the time, Fahd -- now king and incapacitated by a stroke -- presented eight principles for peace, though absent an offer of normalization. The plan was accepted by the Arab League, but subsequently foundered.
But it was a far different context that prompted Prince Abdullah to renew the effort. Even before Sept. 11, the constant violence in Israel, played day after day on Arab television, was building dangerous emotions and pressures, and placing an ever greater strain on Arab relations with the United States -- the only country, in the Arab view, with any influence in Israel.
Nothing has so inflamed the Arabs as the images of American-built jet fighters or helicopters firing on Palestinians, or the razing of houses, or the endless bloodied victims being rushed to hospitals or morgues in a frenzy of fear and panic.
The images are one-sided, to be sure, and there are credible reports of the frustration of some Arab leaders with Mr. Arafat for letting the violence drag on and on. But the fact reported by all Western travelers to the Middle East is the rage of the streets, and the corresponding spread of anti-Americanism.
In a recent Gallup poll of nearly 10,000 Muslims in nine countries -- five of them Arab -- respondents overwhelmingly described the United States as "ruthless, aggressive, conceited, arrogant, easily provoked, biased." Saudi Arabia was among the countries where people registered the most negative views.
Already in August, according to various Saudi and American sources, Prince Abdullah sent Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, to deliver a harsh message for President Bush via the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. That message said that relations between the two nations were at a crossroads, and asked for American help in the Mideast. A few days later, Mr. Bush responded, saying he believed the solution lay in creating a Palestinian state, but there could be no progress unless the violence was stopped.
The encounter led to an exchange of letters between Mr. Bush and the Saudis and in November, at the United Nations General Assembly, the President spoke directly of his wish that "two states -- Israel and Palestine -- live peacefully together within secure and recognized borders."
But by then the terror attacks of Sept. 11 had completely altered the dynamics. The large number of Saudis among the attackers and in Al Qaeda -- whose leader, Osama bin Laden, is the scion of one of the wealthiest Saudi families, although he has been exiled and stripped of his citizenship -- led to a closer and more critical scrutiny of the Saudi kingdom, its educational programs, its money, its policies, its religion, the depth of its commitment to an alliance with the United States. 
The Bush administration now had new, far more pressing priorities, and the perception that Mr. Arafat was not doing enough against "terrorism" moved to the fore. Eventually, Washington was seeming to endorse whatever actions Mr. Sharon wanted to take -- including some that had been hitherto taboo, like the regular use of American warplanes and helicopters against Palestinian targets, reoccupation of Palestinian-controlled areas and the grounding of Mr. Arafat in Ramallah. The administration's special envoy, Anthony C. Zinni, was pulled back.
With relations in crisis, moderate Arab leaders became increasingly aware of an urgent need to break the deadlock. At the World Economic Forum in New York in early February, which was attended by a large number of Arab representatives, the notion took shape that the Arab League would do well to float its own peace initiative, especially since the Israelis and Americans had already done so. Jordan had suggested the idea in a letter to President Bush before Sept. 11. But at the forum, the Arabs concluded that unless the initiative came from one of the two major Arab powers, Saudi Arabia or Egypt, it would stand little chance of acceptance by the Arab world.
Mr. Friedman, the Times columnist and an authority on the Middle East, took part in some of the discussions at the forum, and wrote a column, which appeared on Feb. 6, urging the Arab League to make a clear-cut proposal to Israel.
Soon afterward he traveled to Saudi Arabia, a visit that he described as "part of the Saudi opening to try to explain themselves better to the world in light of the fact that 15 Saudis were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks."
Over dinner with Crown Prince Abdullah, Mr. Friedman decided to test the idea of an Arab proposal to Israel.
"I knew that Jordan, Morocco and some key Arab League officials had been talking about this idea in private, but had not dared to broach it publicly until one of the 'big boys' -- Saudi Arabia or Egypt -- took the lead," Mr. Friedman wrote.
According to Mr. Friedman's published account, the prince said: "Have you broken into my desk? The reason I ask is that this is exactly the idea I had in mind -- full withdrawal from all the occupied territories, in accordance with U.N. resolutions, including in Jerusalem, for full normalization of relations."
The crown prince said that he had prepared the ideas for presentation before the Arab meeting in Beirut, but that he had changed his mind about delivering the speech in protest at the level of violence and oppression to which, he said, Mr. Sharon had climbed.
In subsequent interviews and conversations, Prince Abdullah indicated that he could still launch his idea at the Beirut summit.
According to Arab diplomats familiar with the initiative, the crown prince did not consult any of his brothers, or the Saudi Embassy in Washington, before unveiling his ideas.
How they view it is not clear. At a special session of the United Nations Security Council this week, the Saudi ambassador, Fawzi Shobokshi, made only one reference to the Abdullah proposal and devoted most of his speech to attacking Israel's "systematic terrorism." A translation of Mr. Shobokshi's speech also referred to the offer of "peace and good-neighborly relations," and not the full normalization proffered by Prince Abdullah.
The crown prince's reasons for the declaration and the timing are open to speculation. That he is seriously alarmed by the impact of the Palestinian violence on his own kingdom is clear, with the images of violence spreading radicalism among Saudi youths. 
There is also the problem of worsening relations with the United States, a crucial oil customer and ally of the House of Saud for decades.
There are also war drums beating in Washington for a new push against Saddam Hussein of Iraq, a prospect that Arabs fear will only feed the anti-American sentiments. Mr. Cheney apparently scheduled his Middle East trip with Iraq uppermost in his mind -- a pre-emptive peace initiative in the Middle East may have appeared a promising way to slow the apparent American juggernaut.
In any case, Arab leaders said it had not been the Saudi intention to present a detailed plan, but to establish a tempting horizon toward which the Israelis and Palestinians could start working, or, in Mr. Arafat's words, a "platform" for concrete talks. Even a senior Saudi official has been careful to call the proposals "more a vision than a plan or an initiative."
The crown prince's proposal was broad and subject to interpretation. He spoke to Mr. Friedman of a "full withdrawal from all the occupied territories," which would imply the 1967 borders -- an arrangement unacceptable to the Israelis. But the prince also said "in accordance with U.N. resolutions," in which the extent of withdrawal is deliberately left imprecise.
Adel al-Jubeir, Prince Abdullah's policy adviser, said in Washington this week: "We are not in the real estate or zoning business. It's really up to Israel, the Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria to negotiate, because it's their land. The idea is to send a signal to the Israeli public that peace is possible."
In an Op-Ed article in The New York Times on Feb. 21, Henry Siegman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, quoted unnamed Saudi officials to the effect that the Saudi idea did not preclude Israeli sovereignty over the Western Wall and Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem, or some territorial swaps.
If the territorial message was not entirely clear, then on a central point of dispute -- the fate of Palestinian refugees -- Crown Prince Abdullah was entirely silent. It was a silence noted by both Israel and some Arabs, most specifically Lebanon, whose greatest interest in any settlement would be to unload itself of more than 300,000 Palestinians living in refugee camps.
There was also no suggestion how the final settlement, and the full normalization, should be reached -- for example, whether it had to be all at once, and all or nothing.

Arabs React
Responses Reflect National Interests
From most of the Arab world, the official reaction was positive. For most Arab states -- especially Qatar, Oman, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia, which had had some level of relations with Israel -- there was no reason to oppose the plan. Israel posed a problem to them only inasmuch as it roused passions among their people, and any solution that had a Saudi stamp of approval -- and particularly that of Abdullah, who has a reputation as an Arab nationalist -- was fine by them.
Of those with a vested interest in the outcome, Syria kept silent, and ordered its newspapers to do the same. The reason, experts suggested, was that Damascus needed to be sure that the return of the Golan Heights would be part of any initiative. Lebanon, Syria's ward, offered a cautious nod, but probably out of a sense of obligation as the host of the forthcoming Arab summit. Jordan and Egypt had a clear interest in the initiative, since it served to validate the agreements they had reached earlier with Israel, and for which they had been excoriated by many Arabs.
There was no immediate reaction from the hard-core rejectionists, most notably Iraq. Middle East experts bandied about a variety of motives to try to predict Saddam Hussein's eventual reaction -- he might reject the move in order to enhance his image as a true champion of the Arab cause, or he might accept it to deflect the United States from attacking him.
Those Arab newspapers with sufficient freedom to do so argued on both sides of the issue -- though offering no support for the notation that Israel could be integrated into the Middle East. 
Whatever the perspective from the region's elites, the view from the street is imbued with a profound skepticism. 
"This plan is good but we know that Israel is going to reject it," said Samir Youssef, 48, an Egyptian engineer, as he puffed on a water pipe at a cafe on Cairo's central Tahrir Square. "Israel has no intention to make peace because it has the upper hand. They are the powerful side, so they make the decisions. What Israel is doing to the Palestinians is worse than what happened on Sept. 11." 
Just around the corner, at a McDonald's opposite the American University in Cairo, Wala'a Mahrous, 22, a postgraduate student, had more forceful views. "With Israel whatever was taken by force will only be returned by force," she said. "Only war can regain land. We want peace but they don't, so there's no choice."

Israel
An Anxious Public Seeks Signs of Hope
In Israel, as elsewhere, the Saudi initiative went largely unnoticed at first. But having noted it, some officials and commentators seized on it. With most Israelis dismissing Mr. Arafat as a potential negotiating partner, and with little hope that the violence might end soon, these Israelis began anxiously scanning the Saudi signal for signs of hope.
The press filled with reports of reactions and feelers, and commentators explored the myriad shapes the initiative could, or could not, take. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he would discuss the plan in Paris, while the president, Moshe Katzav, whose role is largely ceremonial, offered to travel to Riyadh. 
Mr. Sharon was said to be skeptical about the Saudi gesture. His terse response to a cabinet minister who urged that the government invite Prince Abdullah to Jerusalem, was: "I have already done some things about this matter." That was taken to mean that he was sounding out the Americans and tapping his private channels to Jordan and Egypt.
"The prime minister is not going to disregard this completely, because even though we may not attach a lot of credence to the initiative, any Israeli government will not leave any stone unturned if there is a chance of peace," said one of Mr. Sharon's political advisers, Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to Washington. "Having said that, I do not think that the results of these inquiries will be worth the effort. This is my private view. I think the motivation behind the Abdullah initiative is fairly obvious." That, he said, was to mend fences with Washington.
Other associates of Mr. Sharon sought to punch holes in the possibility of a Saudi-sponsored breakthrough for peace. They noted that no formal proposal had been made, complained that the Saudis had gone to the press and not contacted Israel directly, and suggested that the true goal might be to throw Mr. Sharon on the defense diplomatically, by putting him in the position of rejecting a vague but seemingly innovative offer.
In the end, some said, persistent differences over territory and rights remained as profound as ever. Dore Gold, another spokesman for Mr. Sharon, said that the Saudi initiative, as reported in the press, suggested a division of lands, and of Jerusalem, that Mr. Sharon has categorically rejected.
"You know, there's the expression, 'I'll make you an offer you can't refuse?' " he said. "This looks more like an offer that any Israeli government would have a very hard time accepting."
Whatever his impression of it, the initiative poses a serious challenge to Mr. Sharon, who has repeatedly promised not to negotiate while the violence continues. 
The notion of returning all the occupied territories, or even most of them, runs deeply against his grain, and even toying with the idea of entering talks on that premise would probably prompt the hard-line members of his cabinet to bolt. Such is their mood in the current war with the Palestinians that they almost bolted last weekend at the mere suggestion of lifting restrictions on Mr. Arafat.
Yet dismissing the proposal risked alienating the left-leaning members of Mr. Sharon's government, who are already musing when to abandon the coalition and start looking to the next elections.
Most important, there was the anxious public, which was beginning to show doubts about Mr. Sharon's motives and abilities. For the first 11 of his 12 months in office, Mr. Sharon enjoyed strong public support.
But over the last month, escalating clashes have fed the sense that he has no more answers to terrorism, and a tepid speech "to the nation" on Feb. 21, in which he talked unconvincingly of building buffer zones against the Palestinians, only strengthened the perception.
A poll by the newspaper Maariv, published on Friday, found a decrease in the number of people satisfied with the prime minister's performance, to 42 percent from 49 percent. Seventy-three percent of the respondents said Mr. Sharon had not fulfilled his promises to the voters.
Israel's doves, who collapsed along with the Camp David talks in 2000, are reviving. More than 250 members of the Israeli reserve forces have signed a letter saying they would refuse to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Peace Now has started a new drive under the slogan "Get out of the territories/Return to ourselves." The notion of a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories is gathering some force across the political spectrum; it apparently contributed to Mr. Sharon's announcement of buffer zones to achieve "security separation."
At the same time, Palestinian militants have stepped up their attacks on soldiers and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the lands Israel occupied in the 1967 war. They are hoping to draw more international support for their cause, while persuading Israelis that those territories are not worth the trouble.
So Mr. Sharon's challenge, a familiar one in Israeli politics, is to move both left and right. In this case, that probably would mean trying to shape the Saudi initiative to his own ends.
"If you take the idea as is, it's a nonstarter for Sharon," said Nahum Barnea, a leading political commentator with Yediot Ahronot. "But Sharon is not foolish. He understands he can play with it. He can say, Look, every party will bring to the table his prejudices, his basic views, and we'll negotiate. He wants to look to the Americans as a statesman, as someone ready to consider every option."

The Americans
An Idea Greeted With Caution
Initially, the American stance was not that different from Mr. Sharon's. When administration officials referred to the Saudi idea, it was usually to stress that it was not a formal proposal, followed by a repetition of the established policy: that it is necessary to end violence according to scenarios devised by a former senator, George Mitchell, and Mr. Tenet -- and, of course, for Mr. Arafat to demonstrate he is serious about combating terrorism.
"We do keep coming back to 'Johnny one note,' " acknowledged a senior administration official. "But none of it jells unless the Palestinians take effective steps to stop the violence and the Israelis are committed to respond.
"I don't think it's wariness," the official added. "We want to be careful about how we describe it. The Saudis have been careful about how they describe it. But it's a vision that's consistent with ours, and therefore it's important to have it out there."
The administration's caution appeared to derive in part from its determination not to end up where President Clinton did, with high hopes for peace turning abruptly into a spasm of violence.
Martin Indyk, Mr. Clinton's ambassador to Israel and now a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, argued that it was the Bush administration's reluctance to become engaged in the Middle East that was the problem, and that the United States should now exploit the symbolic force of the Saudi prince's ideas, and their potential for quelling the violence.
"What the U.S. should do, what this administration won't do, is to try to work the symbolic side of this, because it has a great advantage in terms of widening the circle and raising the horizon of a possible peace with the Arab world," Mr. Indyk said. "It's a vision, not a plan, and we need to enhance the vision. It should be Powell instead of Solana suggesting that Abdullah should come pray at the Al Aksa mosque with Arafat.
"In other words, instead of looking at the down side, we should be looking at how we can turn it to our advantage."
Rarely mentioned, but hanging over all deliberations on the Middle East, is the question of the administration's intentions toward Iraq.
There is a widespread presumption that the administration wants to keep the Israel-Palestinian conflict on a back burner while it weighs its options on ousting Mr. Hussein, and there are those who see the timing of the Saudi statement as trying to forestall an American strike on Iraq. 
On this view, it would be harder to bash Mr. Hussein against the wishes of the Arabs if at the same time they were stretching an olive branch toward Israel.

Uncertain Future
Holding Out Hope For a Long Shot
For now, neither the skeptics nor the optimists have any real notion how the Saudi vision will play out against the violence and hatred that has become the norm. The house-to-house fighting in West Bank refugee camps -- the first Israeli raids into areas synonymous with Palestinian rage and frustration -- seemed likely to generate only more violence and anger. Each side claimed its killings were retaliation, and each killing demanded a greater response.
Yet that same cycle has created a desperation in which any new idea sparks a glimmer of hope. The growing violence has forced American officials to focus more and more just on halting it, rather than pushing specific notions in the Mitchell and Tenet plans for what follows. 
The Saudi idea offers the hope of a world in which Palestinians would not be endlessly humiliated, and Israelis would not be pariahs.
It remains a long shot. The proposal could die in a paroxysm of killing, or it could perish in the maze of Arab politics in Beirut, or before the summit meeting there, or it could wither in the absence of American or Israeli engagement. 
But the very fact that so basic and old a notion as land for peace could garner so much attention has lent it a strength of its own.
"I think the vast majority of people on both sides of the line are looking for a way out," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
"Is this the plan to get them out? I am an optimist by occupational requirement, I hope it's possible, I wouldn't bet a single thing on it, and if I had to bet, I'd say the chances are slim. 
"But there's no other game in town."

HEADLINE: Garden's Spring Prospects Look Like Slim Pickings 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The last time it happened, Jimmy Carter was in the White House, Rod Gilbert was a Ranger and Bob McAdoo was a Knick. John Ferguson had taken over for Ron Stewart behind the Rangers' bench, and Red Holzman was in the final year of his first stint as Knicks head coach.
 It was the 1976-77 season and Madison Square Garden, then the property of Gulf and Western, was empty at playoff time for the second consecutive year because the Knicks and the Rangers had failed to make the playoffs. 
 The Garden, which is owned by Cablevision, faces a similar fate today. The Knicks appear destined for the draft lottery for the worst teams in the N.B.A., especially with center Marcus Camby out for the season. The Rangers, who beat Philadelphia, 6-5, yesterday to end a three-game losing streak, are clinging to the eighth and final playoff spot in the N.H.L.'s Eastern Conference. 
Bob Gutkowski, the former president of the Garden and the former head of MSG Network, said it would have been considered unacceptable for one team to miss the playoffs. "If both teams missed, not only would I have been fired, but they would have cut my head off and rolled it down Seventh Avenue to the Gulf and Western Building and Marty Davis would have come down and stepped on it." Davis was the chairman of Gulf and Western.
For Cablevision, the possibility that both its teams will miss the postseason is primarily a financial problem. But it is also an image problem for the self-proclaimed "world's most famous arena," which has always boasted of providing the best in the country's most diverse, demanding sports market.
"We're talking about a facility, an organization that people view as No. 1," said Brandon Steiner, who runs a sports marketing company. "And all at once, in the spring, there will be no Knicks, maybe no Rangers and no Yankees on MSG. What will the MSG Network show?"
Gutkowski added: "It's catastrophic. It's a financial and image hit for its presence in the world of sports. It's embarrassing as can be."
Although the Garden's financial figures are private, it is believed that each playoff game there generates at least $2 million in revenue (from tickets, concessions, merchandise, arena advertising and commercial time on MSG), and, after expenses, spins off profits that range from $750,000 to $900,000.
Consider that from 1990 to 2001, the Garden was host to an average of nine playoff games a year (a figure that was skewed in 1994 when the Knicks and Rangers each playedhost to 13 games). The profit lost in subtracting nine games can range from $6.75 million to $8.1 million.
"It's a large financial loss, but not just because of the loss to the teams, but the loss of advertising to the MSG Network without the pre- and postgame programs," said Marc Ganis, a sports industry consultant based in Chicago. "Those are the kinds of synergies you're supposed to get from owning the Garden."
In early 1993, the Garden's owner projected potential profits for the playoffs, based on the minimum and maximum number of home games for the Knicks and the Rangers.
According to the projection, if each team went all the way by sweeping all series, total profits were estimated at $11.6 million. If they won their league titles by playing the most games possible, the total rose to $23.4 million. Only the Knicks reached the postseason that year, losing the Eastern Conference finals to the Chicago Bulls in six games.
Although a Garden spokesman declined to discuss the arena's playoff finances, the slow reduction of postseason revenues has affected Cablevision. When the company reported that its cash flow had fallen 11 percent, to $39.7 million, for the three months ended last June 30 (the period coinciding with the playoffs), it cited the Knicks' first-round loss to the Toronto Raptors and the Rangers' absence from the postseason as two reasons. In 2000, the Garden played host to eight playoff games, all involving the Knicks.
The Garden is in a predicament shared by Philips Arena in Atlanta, where the N.B.A.'s Hawks and the N.H.L.'s Thrashers are even less likely than the Knicks and the Rangers to make the playoffs. The Hawks last made the playoffs in 1999; that same year, the Thrashers entered the N.H.L., two years after the Rangers most recent playoff appearance.
 "Of course it's a disappointment," said Stan Kasten, the vice president of Turner Sports Teams, which puts him in charge of the Hawks, the Thrashers and baseball's Braves, as well as Philips Arena and Turner Field. "In our case, we have the Thrashers, an expansion team, and the Hawks, which have been racked by injuries. It's important economically to make the playoffs, but we never budget for them. I don't even budget for the Braves to make the playoffs. If we do, it's gravy."
 The slim prospect that one or both teams will make the playoffs can also hurt the Garden because locking in dates for basketball or hockey games limits the arena's ability to make money from other attractions.
"You can't book those two-week ice skating shows, but you might be able to add some second-tier events on maybe two weeks' notice," said Dan Migala, co-author of "Great Sports Promotions," a publication of Team Marketing Report. "But you also need time to promote them."

HEADLINE: County Battles Federal Cuts 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
JUST how affluent is Westchester County? That question is now the center of a dispute over a proposed cut in federal financing in the county.
 County officials learned recently that Westchester could take a large cut in federal community aid next year, essentially because the county is too wealthy. 
 The National Association of County, Community and Economic Development in Washington notified county officials by an e-mail message of the proposed cuts. The group's executive director, John C. Murphy, last week called the cuts ill conceived. "We're opposed to it and actively working against it," he said. "As it exists, the funds now go to areas based on need, poverty levels, the age and cost of housing." 
Under President George W. Bush's recently proposed budget for 2003, Westchester would receive only $3.5 million in community development block grants, roughly half the $7 million it received under the 2002 budget.
The budget, which is subject to a vote by Congress, uses a "Robin Hood" method of redistributing aid, decreasing financing to wealthy counties and redirecting it to needier ones. Specifically, money would be diverted from areas in the country with the highest average incomes, and steered to impoverished communities along the Mexican border.
"C.D.B.G. money is intended for low-income communities," said Amy Call, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget. "Westchester, which has twice the national average income, doesn't qualify as low-income."
Ms. Call said that the cuts were reserved for about 10 counties that had an average income at least twice the national average. Of these areas, listed in the budget, Greenwich is ranked the wealthiest, with 3.2 times the national average per capita income. Westchester is ranked 10th, with 2.1 times the national average.
Under the proposed budget, Greenwich stands to lose half of its $1.2 million in community funds, Ms. Call said.
Westchester officials complained that the county is in desperate need of all $7 million. The grants are used for a wide range of things including affordable housing, playgrounds, and centers for children and the elderly.
"They're looking to save $3.5 million and send it to the Mexican border, and we certainly don't think that's right," said Donna Greene, a spokeswoman for County Executive Andrew J. Spano. "We're the only community in New York State singled out for this cut because of our supposed high income. They do not take into consideration that we have the highest per capita homeless rate in the country, and we have a tremendous social services need in the area."
Ms. Greene added that the federal budget fails to take into account the high cost of housing in Westchester and the vital need for the financing for affordable housing. She noted that, according to the National Low Income Coalition, Westchester is ranked as the sixth least affordable area in the country.
She said that the county applies for this financing on behalf of 40 of its municipalities, excluding some of the larger cities here, which apply individually.
Mr. Spano's office plans on holding a news conference on Tuesday to urge local elected officials to oppose the president's plan.
Ms. Call explained that the money pulled from the wealthier counties would total roughly $16 million and be sent to help projects in the communities, mostly in Texas, that have a predominantly Hispanic population. Some are the poorest areas in the United States.
An explanation in the budget says that the community development block grant program had become "diluted by the inclusion of some of the richest cities in the country." The reorganization is intended "to return its focus to low-income communities by redirecting funds from the wealthiest, highest-income communities to lower-income areas." Redirecting money to "those communities with the greatest need will make the program truer to its intended purpose and less like a general revenue sharing program."

HEADLINE: Under Duress, Executives Take Jobs on a Lower Rung 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN 

 BODY:
IT happens in every recession, and this one is no exception: out-of-work professionals, and even some corporate executives, drive taxis or make cold calls to make ends meet.
 "I tell people that it's not going to be forever," said a New York career coach, Deborah Brown, who said that the number of professionals who have sought her advice has doubled since Sept. 11. A main task for her is stroking egos and telling executives that it is all right to accept a lower-level position until the job market opens up, she said. "But the truth is, some callers are embarrassed and feel like a failure," Ms. Brown added. 
 Paul Hahn, who lost his job in May as a senior consultant for the Computer Sciences Corporation, did painting and electrical work for a while until finally landing a "real" job, driving a limousine for Hunterdon Connection Limousine in his hometown of Flemington, N.J. 
He made six figures plus bonuses in his old job, analyzing the computer systems of clients like the Bank of Montreal, Phillips-Van Heusen and AT&T and making recommendations. "I was totally in shock when I was laid off," he said. "We stopped our house projects and put off any thought of vacations. We even agonized about having another child." He had been with the company only three years, so his pension was not vested, and the company returned the money he had contributed to his 401(k).
The final insult was a class he attended at the outplacement firm his company had selected. The woman running the class was just out of college and excessively perky. "Hey, guys," he says she told Mr. Hahn and his colleagues, "what a great opportunity for a career change."
Now he calls his early-morning customers the night before, arrives at their homes 15 minutes early, rings the doorbell and wakes up the whole house, and carries their suitcases to the car. Most people are friendly on the way to the airport, but some can be obnoxious. One man said outright, "I don't want to talk, O.K.?" he recalled.
He makes, on average, $35 a trip, including a tip. For this he has to wear a suit and tie.
Before getting his driver's job, Mr. Hahn, 36, considered working the aisles of a big retailer like Staples or Home Depot, but was unnerved by the thought of running into former colleagues. But it would not bother him a bit if he picked up an old associate, he said. In fact, whenever an executive rides in his limousine, he talks himself up and hands out his resume. "I wasn't meeting them any other way," he said.
Efrat Mansdorf has also taken a step down in the job market, though the step seems more like an entire stairway, she says. Ms. Mansdorf, 26, was a project manager with iClips, a Manhattan Internet company that produced streaming media for the Web sites of clients like NBCi, the Internet division of NBC and Yahoo.com. Her duties included managing budgets and schedules and supervising a staff of five.
A major perk was having so much responsibility at her age. "I interviewed and hired people, and I made the typical big Internet salary," she said. Then, after six months on the job, her department was shut down last May just before the company went out of business. "I was so frustrated," she said.
She took it easy for a month or so, taking up biking, enrolling in a Spanish class and catching up on errands. Then Ms. Mansdorf went job hunting. She landed a couple of project-management interviews, but they did not lead anywhere. Her friends with secure jobs could not understand why someone with her background could not get back on her feet.
Finally, in August, she was hired as a research consultant at the National Finder's Service in Manhattan, a company that helps recover assets for individuals and companies that are unaware of their ownership, like money left to heirs in a will.
"I have a master's in communications and four years' management experience," she said. "Someone in junior college could do this job. It's all phone work, and each call is the same. There's no room for creativity. What I'm doing requires zero management skills."
She took the job thinking that the job market would pick up soon. Six months later she is still there. On the bright side, her hours are flexible and her boss, knowing her ambition to return to the corporate world, has no objections to letting her off for job interviews on short notice.
Anybody can get a pink slip, even a job recruiter. Andrew Sequeira, who worked for BroadBand Office, a Falls Church, Va., provider of voice and high-speed data services, found that out when the company filed for bankruptcy protection last May and laid him off along with scores of others.
Mr. Sequeira, 35, who was responsible for hiring a national sales force for BroadBand Office, was the company's sole recruiter at one point after it started slashing jobs. As a pre-I.P.O. company, it needed to show substantial revenue to go public. "My job, getting the right people in place so the company could get that revenue, was pretty important," he said.
All that is behind him now; after moving back to New Jersey, his home state, he was hired last December to sell commercial and industrial signs for JHM Communications in Phillipsburg.
He does not hide his dissatisfaction. "I'm on commission, and I'm not critical to this company's operation," he said. "I supported two vice presidents and six sales managers in my old job, and I dealt with salespeople who had a high level of technical knowledge and were pretty sharp." Now he visits sign franchise companies and tries to arrange subcontracts with them.
Not surprisingly, many former managers down on their luck are reluctant to publicize their plight. Mickey B., who insisted that his last name not be used, is a former Wall Street trader who is now driving a taxi in New York. His firm merged with another last spring, he said, and he chose to leave.
At least, he said, he is in good company. "You can tell the Wall Streeters when you get into a cab," he joked. "We're the ones listening to Bloomberg."
Not many professionals are able to find humor in their descent on the career ladder, though. Ms. Brown, the career coach, recalls a client who felt compelled to clarify her situation to everyone she met. "I'm an administrative assistant, but that's not really what I do," she would say, according to Ms. Brown. "I'm a marketing executive."
Many clients, like a former director of a New York area outplacement firm who now waits tables, use the same phrase in trying to come to grips with their reduced circumstances, she said: "I never thought this would happen to me."
It is unlikely that many managers will be stuck in dead-end jobs forever, of course. After all, while the unemployment rate for executives, administrators and managers has shot up, to 3.3 percent in January from 1.8 percent a year earlier, it is well below the national jobless rate of 5.6 percent. And their prospects for moving back up as the economy pulls out of recession look bright.
Take Mr. Hahn, the limousine chauffeur. He has not gotten any job offers from executives in the back seat, but he was recently offered a job at Levi, Ray & Shoup, an Illinois information technology company, on the same level as his old one at Computer Sciences. While his story has a happy ending, he is keeping the limo job part time. He has to, he said, to make up the salary difference.

HEADLINE: Sort of Deserving; 
Helping the Poor in the Post-Welfare Era

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SIX years ago, one of the most bitterly contested laws of recent times set out to reinvent the welfare system -- or, as President Clinton put it, "to end welfare as we know it." It also ended the political debate about poverty as we knew it, both on the left and on the right.
 Almost no one is making the case these days for restoring the longstanding federal guarantee of assistance to poor families, the entitlement abolished by the 1996 law. And welfare mothers are no longer routinely and disdainfully described as multigenerational dependents of the government. 
 The virtues of putting poor people to work -- "Working Toward Independence!" was the cheerful slogan of the Bush administration last week -- are now widely celebrated. As Isabel Sawhill, an expert on welfare at the Brookings Institution, put it, "a new conversation on poverty" has begun, reflecting a political consensus that would have been hard to imagine in 1995 or 1996. 
This conversation focuses, in large part, on what happens after welfare recipients enter the work force. And many of the same questions are being asked by Democrats and Republicans, although the answers may differ. How can the government help people move up the economic ladder, beyond the lowest paying jobs? Are the "work supports" -- like child care -- adequate for these fragile families? What about the problems that cannot be solved by a job alone, like absent fathers and the high proportion of out-of-wedlock births that stack the odds against so many poor children?
As Congress and the administration begin reviewing the 1996 welfare law, much of which expires this year, the fight is over money and details of specific programs, not the fundamentals. Work requirements and time limits for people on welfare, which generated so much anguished opposition six years ago, are widely considered to be a given; the debate will likely be over how flexible those requirements should be. 
"The overwhelming feeling is, how do you fine tune the program, not how do you create a new welfare system for the country," said Representative Ben Cardin of Maryland, who will lead House Democrats on welfare issues this year.
The world, in short, has changed. Bruce Reed, the former chief domestic policy advisor to President Clinton, and a leading force in welfare legislation, concluded, "The right has moved away from punishing the poor, and the left has moved away from sheltering them." 
Indeed, Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services, described his bipartisan welfare meetings on Capitol Hill last week as almost suspiciously chummy, a reflection, he says, of the success of the 1996 law. "This has been one of the most successful social changes in 60 years and I think people want to be part of it," and Mr. Thompson, who as governor of Wisconsin was a leader in welfare reform.
Not everyone would go that far. But in fact, since the passage of the current welfare law, known pointedly as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, caseloads have dropped by half nationwide and poverty rates have declined as well. Experts argue, endlessly, about how much the long economic boom of the 1990's fueled these trends, and how much the current economic downturn will affect them; already, some states are reporting increases in their caseloads.
But overall, as Ms. Sawhill, a former Clinton administration official, puts it, "Almost all of the data is moving in the right direction: caseloads down, employment up, poverty rates down, particularly among children and minority children."
Liberals, having lost the fight to preserve the old entitlement, have launched a new crusade on behalf of the working poor. Studies show that many who have moved from welfare to work are stuck in low-wage jobs, often without employer-provided health benefits or paid sick leave, according to the Center for Law and Social Policy. Advocates for low-income people want the reduction of poverty to be an explicit goal of the new welfare bill, and to reward states that do so. 
"We're going to say, 'Great, absolutely, it's much better when people can work. But here's the investments you have to make,' " said Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota. And the entitlement? "Politically, that's not where the energy of the debate is going to go," he said.
Conservatives, having won the fight on time limits and work requirements, are beginning another battle on the values front. Reducing out-of-wedlock births and encouraging the formation of two-parent families was a central goal for conservatives in 1996, but one that proved much harder than reducing the welfare rolls. The transformative power of work had its limits. More than a third of all births were to unmarried women in 2000, including 68.5 percent of the births among blacks. So conservatives want to write incentives to promote marriage into the new welfare law.
What is striking about the current debate over welfare, at least so far, is the lack of anger, in comparison to 1995-96. Political strategists say much of the public's anger about antipoverty programs has disappeared as welfare moms became working moms -- and therefore, much harder to demonize. That, indeed, was the result predicted by some of those who advocated doing away with the welfare entitlement to begin with.
DURING the long, polarized debate that led to the passage of the 1996 law, some conservatives on the floor of the House compared poor people to alligators and wolves. Leading liberals resigned from the Clinton administration because Mr. Clinton signed a bill that went far to the right of what he or his advisors originally envisioned. Old Democratic lions like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that the legislation would drive poor families into the streets, invoking dark, Dickensian visions of children "sleeping on grates."
Mary Jo Bane, who resigned in protest as an assistant secretary at Health and Human Services, declared at the time that the legislation "poses serious dangers to poor children." Today, she reflects, "My current take is that the country was enormously lucky that welfare reform was implemented in the midst of the best economic expansion this country has had in decades." Still, she said, "It is possible that the dramatic change of 1996 made it possible to say, 'O.K., we've done that. We've brought responsibility back to the welfare system. Now, let's look at what kinds of supports we can provide.' "
In addition to child care, many in both parties are seeking more emphasis on education and training. But critics assert that training programs in the past were often notoriously ineffective, and sometimes a comfortable substitute for real jobs. 
This "new conversation" will undoubtedly have its ideological moments: The administration's proposal to spend up to $300 million a year on experiments aimed at promoting and supporting marriage has already stirred outrage in feminist camps. 
But much of the edge is gone. And in an election year, with key players in competitive races for re-election, both parties have an interest in passing another "welfare reform" law.
The Bush administration clearly senses the change in the air. President Bush opened the legislative bidding last week with a demand that 70 percent of all welfare recipients be required to work by 2007; currently, about 30 percent of the caseload is working in a typical state. He also proposed extending the hours that an individual is required to work, from 30 to 40 a week, although up to two of those days could be spent on education and training.
Critics assailed that proposal as under-financed and unrealistic, and some Democrats on Capitol Hill complained that he was over-reaching, pushing this new consensus too far. Even so, other Democrats already saw the makings of a legislative deal, given more money, more flexibility and more education and training possibilities for the poor.
Peter Edelman, who also resigned in 1996 from his position as an assistant secretary of H.H.S., said he was "mystified and disappointed" by Mr. Bush's approach. "We asked people to go to work, and they went to work," he said. "They went to work in droves. Now, the president comes around and says, that isn't good enough, we need tougher work requirements."
Mr. Edelman also said that he does not think he was wrong about the 1996 law. He said he still thinks it hurt poor people, but understands the political world has judged it a success.

HEADLINE: Bargains Everywhere but on Wall Street 

BYLINE:  By James Grant; James Grant is the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

 BODY:
In 1962, the late Sam Walton opened the first Wal-Mart store in Rogers, Ark. Forty years later -- just the other day -- Wal-Mart overtook Exxon Mobil Corp. to become the world's biggest corporation as measured by sales. A Wal-Mart spokesman attributed this triumph to an "emphasis on value shopping."
 Reaching into their wallets, consumers demand value. Investing other people's money, professional money managers are less discriminating. The great and growing anomaly of American capitalism is the detachment of individual investors from their own investment dollars. Enron is only the most visible consequence of this estrangement. 
 You would expect that, by now, Wall Street, like Wal-Mart, would have slashed prices. A recession began a year ago, and though some optimists claim it has already ended, economic growth remains anemic. The stock market peaked two years ago. Yet the investment merchandise remains prohibitively expensive.
Of course, there is no one conclusive measure of business value. It's harder to appraise a share of stock than a tube of toothpaste. Is the price of a share reasonable in relation to the earnings of the underlying enterprise? In relation to its dividend (i.e., that portion of the earnings actually distributed to the owners)? In relation to what the stockholders own (i.e., the corporation's net assets)? In relation to interest rates? By none of these measures are the prices quoted for America's biggest companies anything but stupendously high.
Big companies are especially overvalued because the stewards of other people's money have hundreds of billions of dollars they must invest. If Microsoft, Coca-Cola and, yes, Wal-Mart, didn't exist, the Janus and Alliance and Fidelity funds of the world would almost have to invent them. It is the iconic American corporations that constitute the familiar market indices, and it is those indices that define professional investment success.
The Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis-based research firm, computes a valuation measure that weighs share prices against earnings, both historical and estimated. What it finds is that, even now, during what many on Wall Street contend is a savage bear market, the Standard & Poor's 500 index changes hands at about 25 times earnings. It would have to fall by 41 percent to reach the median valuation prevailing since 1957. If Wal-Mart sold common stocks, it wouldn't be selling Yahoo! (at 277 times earnings), nor would it be selling its own (at 42 times earnings).
The mantra that common stocks are the best investment is neither true nor false. Unless modified by three little words -- "at a price" -- it is meaningless. In general, when purchased at Wal-Mart prices, common stocks deliver excellent returns over time. At Tiffany prices, they tend to disappoint.
Fifty years ago, the business of professional money management hardly existed. According to Federal Reserve data, American individuals owned 97 percent of their shares outright. Today, they directly hold a little less than half. The proportion of investment decisions made by mutual funds, pension funds and the like has drastically increased.
No doubt, many fiduciaries care deeply about the funds entrusted to them. They feel almost as if the money were their own. However, empathetic as they might be, their interests are not the same as those of their clients. As a successful investor once told me, the primary objective of most money managers is not to make money for the client. It is to keep the client. And the way to do that, of course, is to look good.
Thus has professional investing become a kind of performance art. A mutual-fund manager looks good by outperforming his or her relevant "benchmark" -- for instance, the S&P 500. To compete successfully, a contestant must run with the market wherever it goes, even over a cliff. Are stocks overvalued? In professional circles, the question is not so much inadmissable as it is irrelevant. On Wall Street, simply avoiding loss is not success. What makes a career in a time like this is losing a little less than the competition.
Concluding his inquest into the crash of 1929, Ferdinand Pecora, counsel to the Senate Banking Committee, prescribed the remedy of full disclosure. Give investors the facts, he reasoned, and they would make informed decisions.
What Mr. Pecora did not anticipate was that the investors would not bother to read the annual reports. The great bull market of the 1990's, preceded by the great bull market of the 1980's, annihilated skepticism on Wall Street. In keeping with the letter of the Depression-era securities laws, companies disclosed the facts (or, at any rate, most of them). However, Wall Street didn't want the facts so much as the earnings, insubstantial and revision-prone as they might be. Corporate America obligingly produced them -- eagerly, in fact, as more and more executives got rich on stock options.
It is understandable that amateurs would fail to notice the alarming divergence between the fundamental value of American businesses on the one hand, and the prices assigned to the pieces of paper conferring ownership of those businesses on the other. What is reprehensible is that the professionals did not.
Alfred Harrison, vice chairman of Alliance Capital Management and manager of the $11 billion Alliance Premier Growth Fund, spoke for many when he confessed in December that "nobody really dug into footnotes" of the Enron financial statements. Mr. Harrison's firm, as of Sept. 30, owned 43 million Enron shares, which raises a question. If a 43-million share investment wasn't enough to command the attention of our leading fiduciaries, what would have been?
In the boom, investing was made to seem effortless. The Beardstown Ladies, meeting once a month, on Thursdays, became best-selling authors by explaining how their investment club had supposedly beat the tar out of the S&P 500. In fact, they did no such thing. (A settlement of litigation over claims to the contrary was disclosed last week.)
There is one way to succeed on Wall Street. It is, in fact, the way Warren Buffett got rich. Pay low prices for the shares of good businesses. Buy them when the rest of the world wants to sell them. Keep your wits about you. Have the courage of your convictions. Sound easy?

HEADLINE: Madison Avenue Is Seeing Glint of a Recovery 

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
After more than a year of misery, Madison Avenue is beginning to glimpse hopeful signs that a rebound in advertising spending is near.
 The indications of an emerging recovery are palpable in growing demand for commercial time during various programs on broadcast and cable television networks. Several advertisers in competitive categories like automobiles and movies have increased their ad budgets. And there have been reports of higher revenue for some large national radio networks. 
 The return of optimism at ad agencies and media companies is also being fed by a rising tide of positive economic news involving consumers, like gains in personal income and the biggest surge in buying big-ticket merchandise since 1987. How willing shoppers are to spend helps determine how willing marketers are to open their wallets.
"The outlook is improving, but whether it holds is the question," said Gordon Hodge, an analyst who follows media companies for Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. 
To be sure, the improvements are patchy so far. Conditions continue to be difficult for many agencies and media owners because most advertisers are reluctant to increase ad spending, which they scaled back in response to the softening economy and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
For every network, magazine or newspaper that reports gains in ad revenue, there is another that reports no relief in sight. And agencies in cities hit harder by the downturn, like Boston, New York and San Francisco, are still laying off employees. That is why most forecasters are sticking with estimates made last fall that a sustained recovery will not begin until the second half of 2002.
Even so, some analysts, agency executives and leaders of ad and media trade associations say they are discovering reasons to be guardedly optimistic after ad spending fell last year by 6 to 7 percent, the worst decline since 1938.
"There are signs of a bottom in the first quarter, signs of hope in the second quarter and signs of light in the third quarter," said Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York who follows advertising and broadcasting stocks.
"To date, radio seems to be leading the way," he added. "Print is still tough. TV is the hardest to describe. The tie-breaking vote, however, is cast by the economic data, which so far is encouraging." How much consumers spend is crucial because they account for two-thirds of economic activity.
"I take heart that we're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel," said Joe Mandese, editor of Media Buyer's Daily in New York, a newsletter published by Primedia, "even if it's in different sectors at different times.
"We've hit some of the bottoms in some of the media sectors," Mr. Mandese said, like commercial time on children's programs on broadcast television, where there is surprisingly robust demand. "For other sectors, like newspapers, the trend is still downward, but the margin of erosion is narrowing."
At some point, increases will appear that are broader and more sustained, "once corporate profits stabilize and marketers can afford to spend," he said. That should become clearer as companies begin to report first quarter earnings -- or the lack thereof -- in April and after. 
Mr. Hodge said that while "television and radio seem to be faring well, and media budgets for Hispanic-targeted advertising are up," there is "no sense of recovery for interactive spending, though it appears to be getting less worse.
"Outdoor advertising has stabilized, but is not better yet," he added, "and the publishing business is still fairly challenged."
Executives at the associations representing the print media agree with that assessment.
"We are seeing some signs of bouncing along the bottom, with upturns in sectors like real estate and automotive," said John Kimball, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at the Newspaper Association of America. "Consumer confidence remains really strong, and that's what gives us confidence."
But because problems persist in big categories like recruitment, he said, papers will see "slow, gradual improvement, with modest growth in the less than 1 percent range."
His counterpart at the Magazine Publishers of America in New York, Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, said: "The first quarter is tricky and the second quarter is shaky, but for the second half there's cautious optimism. Advertisers appear as if they want to try and stay the course on ad spending, yet there is more conservative budgeting as they make decisions more month-to-month than long-term."
"A lot also depends on the category you're in," Ms. Oppenheim said. "Our travel magazines are operating in a different environment than magazines in the food and home categories." Publications in categories like business and high technology are also still suffering steep declines in ad pages because of cutbacks by their largest advertisers.
"Tourism and telecommunications spending is lagging badly," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, "though other categories are coming along very nicely."
"We're not seeing big amounts of new money from increased budgets coming into the market, but in this climate you don't have to spend more to get more," he added. "You can get more for less because of lower media prices."
As a result, Mr. Drake said, "I think we've hit bottom in the first quarter, and I'm reasonably optimistic about a pickup."
Jack Myers, chief economist at Jack Myers L.L.C. in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters, said that those lower ad rates may lead "some marketers to move spending plans forward from later in the year, to take advantage of the soft market."
One important indication of where ad spending is headed, Mr. Myers said, will be the negotiations between agencies and networks to buy commercial time ahead of the 2002-2003 TV season, which will begin in late spring. Those talks, known as the upfront market, "look to be among the most uncertain ever," he added.
Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at West End Communications/Consulting in New York, put it this way: "The ad business got so big so fast that it overheated. It could come back as quickly as it ebbed. As soon as the clients reckon they can sell more if they advertise more, they will."

HEADLINE: The Corner Internet Network vs. the Cellular Giants 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 3 

 BODY:
The informal Wi-Fi networks that inexpensively provide wireless Internet access are fine, as far as they go -- which is generally a few hundred feet. But what happens when there are enough of them to weave together in a blanket of Internet coverage?
 What begins to appear is a high-speed wireless data network built from the bottom up, rather than the top-down wireless cellular data networks now being established by giant telecommunications companies. 
 Many Silicon Valley engineers now believe that it will be possible to take the tens of thousands of inexpensive wireless network connections that are popping up in homes and coffee shops all over the country and lash them together into a single anarchic wireless network. Connections could theoretically be passed from one Wi-Fi node to another, similar to the way wireless phone signals pass from cell to cell, thereby significantly extending the wired Internet. 
Modeled closely on the original nature of the Internet, which grew by chaining together separate computer networks, the technology -- known as wireless mesh routing -- is being rapidly embraced in the United States as well as in the developing world, where it is viewed as a low-cost method for quickly building network infrastructure. 
If the engineers are right, the popular and inexpensive Wi-Fi wireless standard, also known as 802.11, could serve as the wedge for the next-generation Internet, enabling a new wave of wireless portable gadgets that ultimately blanket homes, schools and shopping malls with Internet access. 
Currently most 802.11 networks serve as individual beacons that provide wireless Internet connections to portable computers situated within 200 feet or so of an 802.11 transmitter. What wireless mesh routing offers is the promise of a vastly more powerful collaboration driven by the same forces that originally built the Internet. 
"The good news is that broadband wireless access will finally explode," said Nicholas Negroponte, the director of the M.I.T Media Laboratory. "The social contract is simple: you can use mine when you are in the vicinity of Mount Vernon Street, Boston. But I want to be able to use yours when I am near you."
The technology is being driven both by a gaggle of ambitious start-up companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere and by a hobbyist movement that mimics the original Homebrew Club that led to the personal computer industry.
Today, Tim Pozar and several of his friends are seizing the high ground, literally and figuratively, in a movement that could undercut the nation's cellular companies, which are investing tens of millions of dollars in top-down, heavily engineered, digital cellular networks.
Mr. Pozar, a radio engineer, is a member of the Bay Area Wireless Users Group, an active band of hobbyists who have been building free networks in communities through the region. Mr. Pozar and some of his friends have quietly begun obtaining the rights to place $2,000 wireless network access stations on the mountains and hilltops that encircle San Francisco Bay. If he succeeds, the network will be a starting point for a wireless data network that could eventually spread all over the Bay Area. 
Significantly, what will set Mr. Pozar's planned Sunset Network and those like it apart from the commercial cellular networks now being constructed at great expense is that they will "self assemble" -- expanding from one neighborhood to the next as individuals and businesses join by buying their own cheap antennas that either attach to the wired Internet or pass a signal on to another wireless node.
Mr. Pozar has even come up with a new acronym to describe his plan. In addition to the existing terminology of LAN's and WAN's -- local and wide area networks -- he is proposing the idea of NAN's, or neighborhood area networks. 
The so-called Nanny Networks are rapidly becoming the hottest thing in Silicon Valley and internationally. There are now at least 19 companies developing proprietary wireless mesh routing technologies, all trying to replicate the original Internet in a wireless form.
It is not an easy task because the companies are engineering for a new kind of design, with which they must route data packets over paths where network nodes constantly pop up and disappear. 
Moreover, wireless networks must overcome an array of environmental obstacles that do not plague wired networks, including hills, rain and trees. 
Such networks, however, do have the critical advantage of economy of scale. In contrast to the cellular data networks, in which every customer is an added cost, in some respects in wireless mesh networks the more users who join the better the network performs.
In the jargon of Silicon Valley, wireless mesh routing is potentially a "disruptive technology," a new technology that is likely to upset the existing order by using the same powerful economics of cost and scale that initially drove the growth of the commercial Internet.
Already, companies like Mesh Networks, based in Maitland, Fla., are selling systems of wireless routers, making it possible to create self-assembling and self-healing networks that would cover an urban area. 
There are also companies like Boingo Wireless and Sputnik, which focus on software and services that make it possible for wireless users to roam among networks. Similar technologies were crucial in the development of the original nationwide analog cellular voice networks. 
In Silicon Valley, companies like Skypilot Network, FHP Wireless, Ultradevices, CoWave Networks, SRI's Packet Hop and others are all developing networks that have the potential to weave together networks made up of wireless antennas.
"We're going to start seeing more mom-and-pop Internet service providers buying access points that will support 802.11," Mr. Pozar said. "At first I thought it was going to just be geeks doing wireless, but now everyone has one of these things deployed."

The numbers were up by as much as 47 percent in some areas when they drove a similar route in January. The diagram shows the highest concentrations of Wi-Fi transmitters.; Researchers in San Francisco found 822 Wi-Fi networks along a route in October. By January, Wi-Fi's had decreased in the South of Market neighborhood, the former hub of dot-com activity. (S. Burns/GGHC)(pg. C4)

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Corporations are now spending more on computer services than on computers themselves.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
THE new new thing, to borrow a phrase, is the old old thing: corporate computing.
 In industry jargon, the corporate market is known as "the enterprise," and it is to the mother ship that the people and the money are returning. "Can you blame me?" asked Eileen Richardson, the former chief executive of Napster, who has become the president of Infravio, a promising Silicon Valley start-up in the once-again hot field of enterprise software. 
 Venture capitalists, who not long ago threw money at entrepreneurs promising revolution and new digital industries, are now bankrolling start-ups that sell technology tools to established corporations and help them cut costs, manage operations and serve customers more efficiently. Dreary stuff, perhaps, by the standards of the deceased dot-com era. 
Still, the utilitarian promise of information technology to business has been much the same since 1964, when I.B.M. introduced its 360 mainframe, a flexible machine capable of tackling all kinds of data-processing chores in business. The I.B.M. 360 ushered computing into the corporate mainstream.
Today's focus on the pragmatic problem-solving side of corporate computing is best exemplified by the rise of computer services. These services include just about everything computer-related except the hardware and software products themselves. Services include maintenance, installation, help-desk support and training, as well as consultation on how to use the technology. 
Sometimes, companies hire others to run all or part of their computing systems. This large and fast-growing slice of the services market is the corporate equivalent of rich people hiring maids and chefs to do their cleaning and cooking.
Last year, for the first time, companies worldwide spent more on computer services than on hardware, according to International Data Corporation, part of the International Data Group. To be sure, that was in part because of the steep drop in the purchase of computers as information technology investment slumped. But John Gantz, director of research at I.D.C., expects spending on services to continue well ahead of hardware, reaching an estimated $650 billion in 2005, up from $427 billion last year.
Another sign of the ascent of services, and the comparative decline of hardware, will come today with the announcement of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, a new services operation based in Sunnyvale, Calif. The 2,000-person North American and European unit of Fujitsu Limited will consist in part of the services staff of the Amdahl Corporation, the former maker of I.B.M.-compatible mainframe computers, which Fujitsu acquired in 1997. The company services mainframes, but it no longer sells them.
Fujitsu says it comes to the services market with a new organization, its own distinctive methodology and a new Web site. One old asset is being dropped: the Amdahl brand. "The time had come to retire the Amdahl name and move on," said J. L. Fillmer, the president of Fujitsu Technology Solutions.
The decision was probably inevitable, and scarcely surprising, but there does seem something symbolic to the extinction of a brand linked to one of the industry's great computer designers, Gene Amdahl. He was a principal architect of the 704, 360 and 370 machines at I.B.M., before he departed in 1970 to start his own company.
The services strategy, of course, is a big part of the rationale behind the bid by Hewlett-Packard to acquire Compaq Computer. In promoting her merger plan to a gathering of analysts and investors last week, Carleton S. Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, declared, "The pure product era is over." 
In the future, Ms. Fiorina said, corporate customers will want to buy information technology in a package of equipment, software and especially services to solve specific business problems, instead of being sold the vendors' latest hot products. "This merger allows us to capitalize on this future," she said.
Industry analysts question how strong a services unit the merged company would have, but the move would make that unit far larger. Hewlett-Packard would double its services work force to 65,000 people, moving the company from No. 8 to No. 3 in size. "We will get invited to the table because we are bigger," said Ann Livermore, the head of Hewlett-Packard's services business.
The services leaders, the ones most often at the corporate table, are I.B.M. and E.D.S. I.B.M. in particular has transformed its services business from one that was essentially maintaining I.B.M. machines to a broad-based services operation no longer serving only I.B.M. product groups. The I.B.M. services business now has 150,000 workers, after hiring more than 10,000 people a year for the last five years. By last year, I.B.M.'s global services unit had become a $35 billion business and contributed 49 percent of the company's pretax profits. 
"What we can say to customers is that we have the scale and skills to run parts of your information technology infrastructure more efficiently than you," said Douglas Elix, senior vice president in charge of I.B.M.'s services business.
American Express came to that view after a yearlong review of its information technology needs and strategy. Last week, American Express announced that it had entered into a seven-year outsourcing agreement with I.B.M. valued at more than $4 billion. It is the largest of the utility-like agreements in computer services, in which customers pay for computing services and resources as they use them, much like electricity.
Only a big computing power plant like I.B.M. can offer that service to a company like American Express, a huge corporate consumer of information technology. "They have more scale than we do," said Glen Salow, the chief information officer of American Express. "As we looked ahead, we did not want to have our own information technology infrastructure to be the critical path, or gatekeeper, to our growth."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Hartford Life turns from humor to family concerns in focusing its latest campaign.

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
THE idea: a soft sell, one that emphasizes stability, honesty and reliability. Not a revolutionary concept for a company selling financial services, perhaps, but one that seems well suited to today's recessionary, post-dot-com, post-Sept. 11, post-Enron times.
 At least that is the thinking at Hartford Life, the part of the Hartford Financial Services Group that sells life insurance and investment products (the other part of the company is a property and casualty insurer). The Hartford, as it is known, has put the brakes on "Bring It On," an aggressive, often funny campaign that it ran in the heady economic days of the recent past. 
 A new, lower-key effort will replace it: "Always Thinking Ahead."
Hartford Life has assets of $151.6 billion, said a company spokeswoman, Marnie Goodman. According to A. M. Best, an insurance research company, Hartford is the nation's fourth-largest life company, ranking just behind industry giants like MetLife and Prudential. Best also calls Hartford the fastest-growing major life insurer in the country.
But Hartford Life also has deep roots, with a parent company that has been around since 1810. And that is a potential plus in the eyes of today's somewhat shell-shocked investors, who are looking for reassurance that the Hartford is as stable and, yes, conservative as they are, according to the company's senior vice president for marketing, Ann B. Glover. 
"Times have changed," she said, recalling a commercial shown last year that seems inappropriate now. Set in a lawyer's office, it showed a will-reading where a first wife learns her deceased former spouse has left her his boat. The current wife then learns that she is heir to his Hartford life insurance policy. As the spot closes, the first wife thinks of a modest pleasure craft while the second imagines an ocean liner.
"The economy was booming then, and it was novel to use humor as a way of demystifying financial services," Ms. Glover said, explaining the Hartford's former strategy.
Today, however, "people are seeking a return to stronger values," she said, and "want to do business with a company that shares their sense of integrity."
Hence the new focus. "It gives you reason to pause and think about your goals," said Ron Lawner, chairman and chief creative officer of Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas Advertising. The agency is responsible for both "Bring It On" and the new campaign. "It's more real."
Indeed, the new ads all feature families, using slice-of-life vignettes that stress the reasons why people invest in the first place -- for college or retirement, for example.
The campaign has broadcast and print components, with the print ads playing off the television commercials. For now there are three TV ads, with slightly dissonant music and quick cuts that are shot in a jerky, hand-held camera style that make them look almost as if they were culled from home videos. 
The first of them, called "Growth Chart," shows a mother and father and their three young daughters as the girls line up and have their heights measured and marked alongside a kitchen door. "Will you have college tuition taken care of here," asks the ad, in writing (there is no voiceover), as a pointer indicates a line high up on the door. "Or here?" it continues, pointing to a lower line.
In the second spot, a mother, father and son are seen running through a blissful, suburban autumn landscape. Dad has the boy on his shoulders as they make their way to the commuter station. Mom hands dad his briefcase and he gets on a train. As he heads to what presumably is a city job and a set of worldly responsibilities, his wife and child smile and wave from the platform. Dad presses his hand against the train window, and we see the lines in his palm.
"Would you like to retire here," viewers are asked, as the pointer shows a spot along the so-called lifeline on the father's palm. "Or here?" -- here being the very end of the lifeline.
Finally, there is "Going Home." A harried female executive is depicted at the end of a long day as she packs up her papers and stuffs them into her bag. As she leaves her office, a drawing that hangs on the office wall is seen. Obviously made by a child, it shows a little girl standing next to her mother. In one of mom's hands is a briefcase. "When you get home will your mind be here?" (pointer indicates briefcase in drawing), "or here?" (pointer indicates child).
All three of the commercials end with the words "The Hartford" and the image of the large stag that has long been the company's symbol. Together with the "Always Thinking Ahead" tagline, a final message is superimposed on the screen: "Investments. Insurance. 190 Years of Wisdom."
The print ads are appearing in periodicals, including The Wall Street Journal, the New Yorker and the Atlantic Monthly. The television spots began running yesterday during N.C.A.A. basketball games and will also be seen on "The West Wing," "60 Minutes" and "E.R." -- programs where they can be seen by the affluent consumers at whom they are aimed, according to Mr. Lawner of Arnold Worldwide.
But won't such viewers find the ads a trifle corny? Maybe, said the Hartford's Ms. Glover, but that's all right.
"We're telling them that it's hip to be square," she said.

HEADLINE: Peanut Proposals Put a New Wrinkle on Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3 

 BODY:
Buried in the proposed farm bill is an entirely new $3 billion subsidy for peanut farmers, a 10-year entitlement of direct cash payments meant to help American peanut farmers adjust to competition unleashed by the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 But that is not all. 
 The government would pay an additional $1.3 billion to "buy out" many of those same farmers and others who hold lucrative licenses, known as quotas, to grow peanuts. Under the current 70-year-old subsidy system, only 1.5 million acres can be used for planting peanuts for domestic consumption, and the quotas to farm those acres have grown increasingly valuable. Under the new plan, the government would buy up those quotas from their owners, who could then continue growing peanuts under the new subsidy system. 
Agricultural economists say they can think of no parallel for such a plan.
"It is like the Maryland tobacco buyout, where farmers were given a large one-time payment to stop growing tobacco," said Bruce L. Gardner, a University of Maryland professor and former assistant secretary for economics at the Agriculture Department under the first President Bush. "But these farmers will continue to grow peanuts under a new program."
Blame Canadian peanut butter for the proposals.
Since Nafta, the trade agreement, was signed, American farmers no longer had an effective monopoly on peanuts for American consumption. Imports of lower-priced Canadian brands have increased 45-fold. Raw Mexican peanuts have also started to take a share of the American market.
If something is not done by 2005, when all peanut tariffs will effectively disappear, the price supports, or guaranteed prices for the farmers from the industry, will end. American peanuts and peanut butter would price themselves out of their own market.
Lawmakers looked for a plan that would comply with the trade rules of the global marketplace, lower the price of American peanuts to make them competitive and still provide peanut farmers with a cash safety net. Their answer was to get the taxpayers to subsidize the farmers.
"This is another example of moving away from the old price support system that was paid for by the food industry and consumers and passing that burden on to the taxpayer," a senior Agriculture Department official said.
The buyout program addresses a different problem.
Over the years, the federal peanut program evolved from a basic price support program to one in which quotas to grow peanuts could be traded and rented.
Some quotas are even part of investment portfolios, owned by people who have no intention of farming peanuts.
The biggest owner of these quotas is not a peanut farmer but the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company of Boston.
The giant company could receive up to $2.1 million from the government to give up its licenses controlling 3.8 million pounds of peanuts grown in Georgia, according to data compiled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group from government documents retrieved through a Freedom of Information Act request.
A spokesman for the parent company, now known as John Hancock Financial Services Inc., said he was unable to comment on the proposed buyout.
Lawmakers from the House and Senate have begun hammering out the differences in their separate versions of the omnibus $171 billion farm bill, arguing over where to cut money. 
Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, which is home to some of the country's largest peanut farms, said that he and his fellow House conferees would cut money for food stamps and conservation programs rather than reduce subsidy programs for commodity crops like corn, wheat and peanuts. 
"It just makes more sense when we're looking at a budget deficit," Mr. Stenholm said.
But Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who is also a conferee, said he had "precisely the opposite point of view of Mr. Stenholm."
"It would be an unfortunate compromise to boost crop subsidies," Mr. Lugar said, "and not retain the advances the Senate has made on improving conservation and nutrition payments." 
This new $4 billion program would benefit farmers in the South: Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia, the center of American peanut production. While Jimmy Carter, the former president and peanut farmer, made Georgia peanuts famous, his name does not appear on the list of those who hold licenses or quotas.
However, the chief proponent of the new program is Senator Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia.
"Right or wrong,"Mr. Miller said, "this peanut quota was created by the government. It is unfair to portray quota holders as just large corporations. The long list includes small landowners, widows and aging minority farmers in our country's poorest counties."
The nonprofit group that compiled the peanut data said, though, that it had made the information public to demonstrate how the top 10 percent of peanut farmers control 60 percent of country's peanut farming. "They're hiding behind the poor farmers when in fact this buyout is nothing short of a boondoggle for the biggest farmers," said Anne Keys, vice president of the Environmental Working Group. "Faced with a choice, we hope Congress chooses conservation programs that help all farmers."
Among the most prominent names on the list are the descendants of George Washington Heard, who began peanut farming in southern Georgia in the 19th century, said Waymon Heard, his 71-year-old grandson.
Together the family holds quotas for 8.86 million pounds of peanuts and could receive $3.8 million in the buyout, according to both Mr. Heard and the database. His nephew, Glenn Heard of Brinson, Ga., could be eligible for $1.5 million in the buyout alone and $1.67 million in subsidies. 
Waymon Heard said the family was uneasy about giving up the old peanut quota system, which guarantees them $610 a ton for their peanuts, roughly twice the world price, and a sizable share of the American domestic market. Now, they will face the uncertainties of foreign competition and taxpayer subsidies controlled by Congress.
"There's no telling what will happen before the smoke settles," said Mr. Heard, who has retired from farming and is turning his operation over to his son. "Nafta is the worst thing that ever happened to this country. Quality is going down. Canadian peanut butter. Mexican peanuts. Worst thing that happened."

HEADLINE: An Alaskan Hot Spot, Even at 50 Below Zero 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: CHENA HOT SPRINGS, Alaska, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Haruna and Taketoshi Harada thought about honeymooning in Paris. They considered Hawaii. But in the end, they journeyed here, to a frigid mountaintop near the Arctic Circle in Alaska, where they nuzzled at 2 o'clock the other morning while gazing at the starry dome of the sky. They were not disappointed. 
 "It's like a curtain of colors, dancing across the sky," Mr. Harada said of the northern lights. "Very vibrant," Mrs. Harada said. "Very beautiful." 
 That same elation struck several other visitors to the mountain, 60 miles east of Fairbanks, despite temperatures well below zero. Kazuhiro Omura, a young medical student from Tokyo, was so happy when the ghostly green lights suddenly appeared and danced above him that he rolled in the snow, laughing. Then he lay on his back and watched the show, proclaiming in Japanese how beautiful it was.
Having long marketed itself as a prime destination for summer tourists, Alaska has been surprisingly successful in recent years luring vacationers in winter as well, many of them from Japan, where the aurora borealis seems to exert an almost mystical pull and where many newlyweds consider a viewing of the lights to be the height of romance and an auspicious sign for a marriage.
The area in and around Fairbanks is recognized as one of the best places on earth to see the shimmering lights. With a variety of other winter activities, including dog-mushing schools and the annual World Ice Art Championships, which begins on Tuesday in Fairbanks, the city has billed itself as a must-see at this time of year, despite the often biting cold.
"Our line on that is, 'Yes, but it's a dry cold,' " said Karen Lundquist, communications manager for the Fairbanks Convention and Visitors Bureau. "But it is cold. It's hard, when it's 50 below, to say that it's not cold. I don't know how you get around that."
Actually, despite Fairbanks's slogan -- "Winter: Always Guaranteed!" -- Alaska has been subject to the same moderation of normal temperatures that much of the Northeast has experienced this year. Night temperatures here in recent weeks have reached a positively balmy zero degrees. 
Many Alaskans are not celebrating: they like it as cold as possible in the winter, and increasing temperatures have set off a wave of alarm about rising sea levels that could threaten coastal villages and thawing in the permafrost that could wreak havoc with roads and even huge structures like the trans-Alaska pipeline.
For now, though, the visitors are coming, and no place is more popular with Japanese tourists than Chena Hot Springs, a remote old lodge reachable on a paved road from Fairbanks.
For the Japanese in particular, the Alaskan wilderness seems to offer a temporary escape pod. 
"I love Tokyo, but in Tokyo you cannot feel nature, there are so many artificial things," said Mr. Omura, 22, who traveled here during his winter break with two fellow students from Jikei University, Kentaro Yamakawa and Eriko Kamada, and spent each of the last five nights searching the night skies for the northern lights. 
Miss Kamada said, "Here, it is just so silent." 
Despite the downturn in the Japanese economy, bookings are strong at the Chena Hot Springs Resort, with about 3,500 Japanese expected to visit this winter, said Joe Juszkiewicz, the general manager, who has hired three Japanese-speaking guides, as well as a dog-mushing instructor and marketing director who are also fluent in the language. Alaska can be reached relatively cheaply via a Korean Air Lines flight through Seoul that connects to Anchorage. 
At the resort, February and March are actually considered the "high season," even busier than July and August, although that is still highly unusual for any tourism-related concern in Alaska. Certainly, the number of summer vacationers here, which the state's Department of Community and Economic Development estimates to be about 900,000, dwarfs the winter counterparts. 
Yet the number of winter travelers who describe "vacation and pleasure" as their primary reason for coming has more than doubled in the state's surveys over the last decade, to 45,000 in 2000-2001 from 21,800 in 1990. 
State tourism officials and resorts have advertised intensively in Japan. The state has also sponsored an advertising campaign in the Southwest United States for an "Alaska Winter White Sale," although officials concede that their mission can be a tough sell. 
One major draw is the sled dog racing, including the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod. Another, of course, is the northern lights, though Alaska competes with Canada, Greenland and Norway to entice visitors to come see them.
The aurora, ribbons of moving, bright lights caused by charged solar particles that congregate through magnetic pull toward the earth's poles, is not a sure thing on any given night. Cloudy skies can obscure it for days on end. But in late February and March here, the odds are pretty good for a spectacular display. 
That happened here this evening, sending a dozen or so tourists charging out of a snow machine that brought them to a ridge high above Chena Hot Springs.
Some couples wandered off to be alone. Masaaki Tsuruoka, an air-conditioning engineer from Tokyo, quickly went to work with his camera. A few tourists quickly made for a heated yurt and fortified themselves with hot cider and ramen noodles. The three medical students from Tokyo just lay on the snow, looking up.
"It is an amazing thing," said Kentaro Yamakawa, 23. "Beautiful. Mysterious. I don't want it to stop."

HEADLINE: Argentine Estates Decay With Economy 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CANADA DE GOMEZ, Argentina 

 BODY:
As a child growing up in the 1940's, Carlos Emilio Lamas always thought that his grandfather's 12,000-acre estate here on the pampas was a magical place. There were hundreds of horses and thousands of cattle, and on weekends a steady stream of visiting relatives and friends.
 "Life was very comfortable for us then," he recalled recently. "We would play polo in the morning, go hunting for partridges in the afternoon, and in the evening, the dining room was always full, never with less than 15 people." 
 Today, Mr. Lamas, now 60, is the owner of the estate, the Estancia Delsel -- or rather, the little that remains. Less than a tenth of the original acreage is still in his hands, and the cost of maintaining the stately 7,200-square-foot manor house, with its six bedrooms, six bathrooms, pool, wine cellar and coach house, "is not on the same scale as my income," he said. 
Instead of 400 horses, the estate here, about 230 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, now has only 40, all but 10 of which belong to boarders who pay Mr. Lamas a monthly fee. Where cattle once grazed on some of the most fertile pastureland in the world, Mr. Lamas now hopes to build small cottages where horse lovers can stay on weekends and ride or hike.
For more than a century, the estancia, or rural estate, has been one of the most elegant symbols of Argentina, as well as one of its principal sources of wealth. But the landed gentry who own those properties have long been in decline, and the country's current economic crisis, the worst in its turbulent history, is only accelerating that process.
"My grandfather used to say that even though the countryside squeezes, it doesn't strangle," Mr. Lamas said. "But we're at the breaking point. The rural producing class is in debt up to its neck and struggling to survive."
Nearly 11 years ago, Argentina made the peso and the American dollar virtually interchangeable. That policy, which lasted until January, when the link was severed and the peso devalued by more than 50 percent, was intended to catapult a closed economy into the modern age by attracting foreign investment and forcing Argentine producers to become more efficient and competitive.
Landowners responded as it was hoped they would, by investing heavily in new equipment and technology with the aim of capturing new markets abroad. Grain harvests doubled, to 70 million tons a year, but the prices that producers get for beef and for other agricultural exports like wheat, corn and soybeans have lagged far behind the cost of machinery, fertilizers and other supplies.
"The distortion in relative prices has been tremendous," said Jose Ignacio de Mendiguren, who is the minister of production in the government that took power early in January, also the owner of a country estate. "Four years ago, with the earnings from two pounds of meat you could buy a gallon of diesel fuel. By last year, you needed nine pounds of meat to buy that same gallon of diesel."
Farm producers ended the decade with $6 billion in accumulated debt, according to the Argentine Rural Society, a landowners group. "When you've got zero inflation and are paying interest rates of up to 20 percent in dollars, you're going to be hit hard, no matter how fertile and productive your land may be," said Luciano Miguens, a vice president of the group and a member of a prominent landowning family.
Mr. Lamas said he had managed to stay out of debt, unlike his neighbors, "90 percent of whom are in a state of collapse." But in his struggle to stay afloat, he has been forced to turn to many of the same moneymaking schemes as they have, activities that have little to do with agriculture or his own expertise.
Initially, he intended to turn his manor house into a bed-and-breakfast for tourists, as many landowning families near Buenos Aires and other large cities have done, and invested heavily in a remodeling project. But his estancia is too far from a big city to be attractive to tourists and, as he quickly discovered, "you have to give up too much of your own privacy."
Instead, Mr. Lamas now rents out the house for corporate conferences, weddings and birthdays. He talks of building a hotel on the property. He has bred a flock of pheasants to attract weekend hunters and is trying to sell part of his land to a group that wants to an industrial park. He has even acquired a llama, an ostrich and a bevy of peacocks in hopes of attracting visitors.
"I'm looking for every opportunity I can find," he said. "Between the two of them, my grandfathers owned more than 300,000 acres of land. But the days when you could finance a long trip to Europe simply by selling a few thousand head of cattle, those days are gone forever, never to return."
On a smaller estate in Ibarlucea, nearly 50 miles from here, the Albertengo family is trying another approach. They continue to grow wheat, corn and soybeans, but they are converting a 70-acre piece of their 1,100-acre estate into a housing development to be called Los Alamos, subdivided for 103 homes.
"Our plan is to gradually get out of agriculture altogether and turn the entire estate into a series of housing developments," said Mario Jose Albertengo, a 43-year-old agronomist. "We have discovered that land is more valuable when sold by the square foot than when sold by the acre."
Their location, a 20-minute drive from Rosario, the country's third-largest city, would seem ideal. But Argentina's economic situation is so bad right now, mainly as a result of a freeze on bank accounts imposed by the government early in December, that the real estate and construction industries are paralyzed.
"If the country lends us a helping hand by stabilizing the economy, we can make a go of this," said Marcelo Mascetti, Mr. Albertengo's cousin and an architect working on the project. "But this is a delicate moment, and right now the bank freeze is simply killing us."
Farther south, in Patagonia, where estates of 100,000 acres or more are not uncommon and the cost of upkeep is even higher, the situation may be even worse. By one recent tally, half the 1,200 estancias in the province of Santa Cruz have simply been abandoned, their manor houses left to decay in a windy and frigid climate because their owners cannot make ends meet.
Historically, Patagonia is the country's leading sheep-growing and wool-producing region. But farms there have been driven out of business not only by the same economic conditions that afflict other Argentine estates but also by the growing popularity of artificial fibers, which drove down wool prices in the 1990's.
Many of the remaining estates have been sold to foreign entrepreneurs like Ted Turner, to be made into lodges for tourists, or acquired by large corporations and merged into semi-industrialized plantations. According to the Argentine Wool Federation, the country's leading wool producer is now Benetton, the Italian clothing manufacturer.
"With their numbers in the red, many estate owners have simply gotten rid of their sheep, and so the wool culture is gone with them," Joaquin Allolio, an official of the federation, said. "Nowadays you can't even find gauchos who know how to handle sheep."
As he surveys the peacocks strutting across his lawn here, Mr. Lamas worries about the future, too. He has four children, and doubts that any of them will be able to inherit a property that has been in his family for more than 80 years.
"I've been very fortunate to be able to have lived like this, and I'm not complaining," he said. "I know that there are people who will not lament the passing of this way of life, but to me, what is happening seems very cruel. Argentina is a lottery, and we simply don't have the winning numbers anymore."

PERSON: David Hawkins 

HEADLINE: David Hawkins, 88, Historian For Manhattan Project in 1940's 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:
David Hawkins, a philosopher of science who was an assistant to J. Robert Oppenheimer when he directed the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb and the official historian of the project, died on Feb. 24 at his home in Boulder, Colo. He was 88. 
 After the project, of which he was later very critical, he spent the balance of his life teaching and writing about the philosophy of science and training teachers in the education of children in science and math. 
 He received a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant in 1986, the first year of the awards, for work in philosophy and childhood science education.
David Hawkins was born on Feb. 28, 1913, in El Paso, the youngest of seven children of William Ashton Hawkins, a railroad lawyer and a founder of the city of Alamogordo, N.M., and Clara Gardiner Hawkins. 
He attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, leaving after his junior year to enroll at Stanford University, where he majored in philosophy. After receiving a B.A. in 1934 and an M.A. in 1937, he went to the University of California, earning a Ph.D. in probability theory in 1940. 
In 1937, he married Frances Pockman, a teacher and writer. He taught at Berkeley until May 1943, when he went to Los Alamos, N.M., as the official government historian of the Manhattan Project and liaison officer to the War Department, as well as Dr. Oppenheimer's aide. 
From Los Alamos, he went to Washington in 1946 to teach at George Washington University. The next year he was hired as an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado, where he spent the rest of his teaching career. In 1949, he developed, along with Herbert Simon, an economist, a theory known as the Hawkins-Simon condition, which is still taught in advanced macroeconomic courses. The theory helped economists understand the interconnectedness of various sectors of an economy.
In December 1950, Dr. Hawkins was called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in its investigation of reports of Communist infiltration at the University of California's radiation laboratory and atomic bomb projects. He testified that while at Berkeley he joined the Communist Party in 1938 and left it in the spring of 1943. Both he and his wife, who also testified, refused to name any people they had known to be Communists unless their names had already been cited by the committee. He denied that there was a Communist cell at the radiation laboratory. 
His grandson Scott Fisher said that in a vote on his future employment, the regents of the University of Colorado split evenly, but his job was saved when one of them died.
Dr. Hawkins published "The Language of Nature: An Essay on the Philosophy of Science" (1957), among other books. In 1995, he gave the Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Lecture at Los Alamos on the 50th anniversary of the Manhattan Project.
In addition to his wife and Mr. Fisher, of Hoboken, N.J., he is survived by his daughter, Julie Fisher Peck of Lebanon, Ohio; and another grandson, Thomas Fisher, of Portland, Me. 
Dr. Hawkins was reared in the New Mexico desert and is credited with having chosen the drop site for the first test of the bomb, but he felt little enthusiasm for the project. 
As he told an interviewer in 1995, after the bomb was dropped he no longer felt a doomsday weapon was needed, and he was disturbed by the scientists' casual hallway debate over the possibility, however slim, that the blast might ignite nitrogen in the atmosphere and literally blow up the world.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE STREETS; 
A Secured Kandahar Is Now Safe Enough For Some Night Life

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, March 3 

 BODY:
A group of men, neither police officers nor soldiers, walk through a shadowy bazaar, oblivious of the time. That is a remarkable state for them to be in, given that this is Afghanistan and it is 10:52 p.m.
 Since 1979, when the Soviets invaded the country, Kandahar and every other city has lived under a nighttime curfew of at latest 10 p.m., and often earlier. Afghans have become as used to truncated nights as they have to war. A whole generation knows nothing of night life. 
 But two weeks ago, as a sign of faith in his city's safety, the provincial governor lifted the curfew here, the first place in the country where that has been done. 
While the streets are still mostly deserted after 10, more people -- more men, that is -- are creeping out, astonished at their own freedom.
"I am 24 years old, and this is the first time in my life I feel security is good in Kandahar, that I can walk on the streets freely whenever I want," said Abdullah, the owner of a video shop. It was 11:30 p.m. as he walked home.
A few months ago no one would have picked Kandahar to be first to this starting gate. The Taliban founded their movement largely because the city was so anarchic in the early 1990's. And when the Taliban government ended late last year, it did so nowhere more chaotically than here.
American bombs pounded the city as the Taliban dug in. Rival anti-Taliban commanders vied for control as gunmen cruised the streets. Later, a group of Al Qaeda fighters barricaded themselves in a hospital, grenades strapped to their bodies, in a standoff that lasted for weeks.
But little by little the city of Kandahar, and increasingly the countryside around it, have calmed. Crime is relatively under control, political violence noticeably absent. As the country sometimes seems to be sliding toward disarray, Kandahar's mild success bears noting.
"The security situation is surprisingly positive," said Leslie Oqvist, the United Nations regional coordinator for southern Afghanistan. A United Nations Development Program security report says that security "has improved tremendously in the past two weeks" and that access has been opened to a much bigger area of the region.
The stability is fragile. Pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters remain. There are thousands of unpaid soldiers who may be tempted to commit crimes or may be manipulated by political opportunists. The government plans to eradicate thousands of acres of poppies this month, which could prompt an angry response. The police are catching robbers and murderers, but there is no court system to deal with them.
Officials here, like those across the country, are pushing for an international peacekeeping force because, said Yusuf Pashtoon, an aide to the governor, after 22 years of war there is no trust. "If two major commanders don't trust each other, there can be an explosion," he said.
But for now, said Lal Mohammad, 60, a shopkeeper, "The security's very good." Women said they felt safe in the city.
So what is the secret? Unlike the ethnically diverse north, Kandahar has a population that is almost entirely Pashtun, which eliminates many of the ethnic grievances or revenge crimes that are causing problems elsewhere.
Recognizing the strength of Pashtun bonds, and looking to consolidate his power rather than create resistance, the governor, Gul Agha Shirzai, is taking a fairly tender approach toward former Taliban. Unless atrocities can be proved, he has insisted that those captured -- including the former Taliban foreign minister, Mullah Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil -- be released to the Afghan people.
Mr. Shirzai was governor from 1992 to 1994 before going into exile in Pakistan. By the time he left, things were so bad that residents say they were afraid to walk from one store to another with money in their pockets. Rape and looting were common, all of which fed the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar's vision of a force that would restore order.
Mr. Shirzai seems determined to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Unlike, for example, leaders in Jalalabad, where warlords have worked hard to squeeze each other out, Mr. Shirzai has worked closely with his rivals, who include the brother of Hamid Karzai, the country's interim leader.
"There is a balance between power groups," said an aide to Mr. Shirzai, Yusuf Pashtoon. "The power groups are tribes, and if they are secure enough, the rivalries aren't there." Those rivalries have also been quelled, average Afghans and aid officials agree, by the active presence of the American military. Having 4,000 American soldiers stationed at Kandahar Airport has a deterrent effect. 
Troops do "first light" and "last light" patrols on the outskirts of the city. Members of the American Special Forces eat lunch in the Kandahar Restaurant with semiautomatic weapons slung over their shoulders or laid next to them on the floor. The Special Forces bivouac behind the governor's palace and, as heavily armed bodyguards, are never far from Mr. Shirzai's side.
For now, said Habibullah Wadji, an education worker with an international aid organization, the Afghans accept the troops' presence, because they believe that the Americans will build roads, fix hospitals and create jobs.
Many say that there is plenty of American money coming in, but that most of it is going to Mr. Shirzai to distribute among commanders to buy their allegiance, and their quiet. 
That is impossible to prove, but many soldiers do carry American-provided Kalashnikovs, which were airdropped during the fight against the Taliban. There are few commanders without their own Thuraya satellite phones.
"The Americans are telling them don't fight or the money won't come in," one aid official said. "They are literally holding their hands and saying don't fight." The reason, they say, is that it is almost as important to show that Kandahar can work as Kabul: it was the Taliban's heartland and the home of Mr. Karzai, who has been backed by Washington.
But the Afghans are also making their own concerted drive toward law and order here. The army has been confined to barracks, and soldiers from different factions have been integrated into the police force. They have been given uniforms, which they wear most of the time. Occasionally they march through the city in camouflage uniforms with white epaulets, a random strand of order in a city more prone to its opposite. They are being given some basic training.
"The police system was not working, and we worked hard to organize the police forces," said the new chief, Muhammad Javed Akram.
The government has moved quickly to collect weapons, giving a deadline for their voluntary surrender. It has begun acting on tips and says it will do house-to-house searches.
Isireli Dugu, the security officer for the United Nations Development Program, noted that probably only a fraction of the weapons in the city had been turned in. But, he said, the effort has had a deterrent effect, in that people holding on to weapons are less likely to use them, because they might be confiscated.
The result is that "there's hardly anyone with a weapon in civilian clothes," Mr. Dugu said.
Unless they happen to be American Special Forces, of course. That contradiction has prompted worry that the American presence could ultimately provoke violence. 
In the last three weeks there has been a firefight at the airport's edge and two Russian-made rockets fired toward the base there. Last Friday, at least one Afghan soldier was killed when he stepped on a land mine a mile from the airport. The Americans say there were reports of two men digging in the area before the blast, suggesting that the mine might have been newly planted.
There is also the question of what happens when the Americans leave, and whether those they have armed and supported act in the Afghans' interest or their own. 
"Let's hope the Americans don't repeat the mistake of the war against the Russians," said Mr. Wadji, the education worker. "The warlords were a product of that era. America supported warlords in the name of the mujahedeen, and later they supported a nightmare for Afghanistan."

HEADLINE: A Russian Trademark Dispute Sends a Vodka Brand Fleeing 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 3 

 BODY:
Sitting on a lonely dock in the Russian port city of Kaliningrad, a load of Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya vodka awaits shipment to bars and liquor stores in the United States and other foreign watering holes because of a trademark dispute between a Russian company and the Ministry of Agriculture.
 The company, Soyuzplodimport, has struck back by moving its Russian production of Stolichnaya to Latvia -- to Russians the rough equivalent of raising Russian sables in Guadalajara. 
 The crux of the dispute is that the Russian government believes that the trademarks for Stolichnaya, the No. 2 imported vodka in America, and Moskovskaya, which is popular in Western Europe, were obtained for a pittance and that they want the trademarks back. The company claims government officials are trying to wrest away its rights to the Stolichnaya name for their own dark motives. "It goes against logic and justice," said Andrei Skurikhin, general director of the company, during an interview in his Moscow office. "It's a huge violation. You can't just take away property." 
The fight represents one of the worst fears of Russian capitalists, many of whom took advantage of the economic chaos after the fall of the Soviet Union to buy up companies and trademarks. 
Small entrepreneurs often must battle the government to keep their assets out of the hands of acquisitive government officials. Mr. Skurikhin blames the personal interests of a small number of powerful officials for his current problems. 
Whatever the reason, the vodka dispute intensified last year, when a court ruled that the company, known by its acronym, S.P.I., was not the legal heir to the brand names of 43 popular Russian vodkas, including Stolichnaya, a major national symbol. The company fought back and won the return of most of the brands. But as frequently happens in Russia, that was not the end of it.
Russia's general prosecutor began criminal cases against S.P.I. vodka factories in Russia. Last month, in what seemed the ultimate insult, a second Stolichnaya brand -- approved by the Agriculture Ministry -- mysteriously popped up at a food show here. Ten days ago, the government refused to let the vodka move from the loading dock.
The Agriculture Ministry argues that rights to the names of the 43 vodkas were snapped up illegally, and far too cheaply, when Russia began its program of selling off state industries in the early 1990's.
Mr. Skurikhin, 31, played no role in that transaction. But when SPI acquired the trademarks in 1997, officials here say, it bought responsibility for the way the trademarks were purchased some five years earlier.
Mr. Skurikhin acknowledged that the brands came cheaply -- $300,000, to be exact -- but he said they were worth little then because no money had been put into promoting them. Also, in the turmoil after the fall of the Soviet Union, the vodka business was virtually unregulated and knockoffs of brands like Stolichnaya popped up across the nation. 
"Those were the rules of the game in the market," he said, referring to what he paid for the trademarks. "The whole country was living by those rules."
Russia's Supreme Court would seem to agree, having ruled in 1999 that the brands had been acquired legally. Moreover, S.P.I. has a photocopy of a 1992 letter signed by the then first deputy minister of agriculture stating that the brands were property of the company eventually bought by Mr. Skurikhin.
But industry experts in the government are not so sure. SPI was set up on the bankrupt carcass of its predecessor to avoid losing the trademarks to a hungry creditor in Latvia. SPI did not bother changing the company's name. It took the Soviet-era acronym, Soyuzplodoimport, and dropped one of the O's in the name.
"It's the same as me setting up a factory here called Ford, but changing one letter," said Nikolai I. Koryazhkin, deputy general director of Rosspirtprom, the state agency that manages the portion of this country's vodka industry that is still government owned. "How would that look?"
Worst of all, officials say, Mr. Skurikhin has begun producing Stolichnaya at a factory in Latvia, a former Soviet republic that is now one of Russia's least friendly neighbors.
Mr. Skurikhin says his company helped fight illegal production in Russia to protect its trademarks. It has registered trademarks of Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya in more than 100 countries, and has contracts with foreign distributors, including Allied Domecq of Britain which distributes Stolichnaya in the United States. The company expected vodka sales worldwide of up to $400 million this year, Mr. Skurikhin said.
He wrote a letter to Russia's president Vladimir V. Putin last year, but he did not receive a reply. So with a shipment tied up in Kaliningrad the Latvian factory will pick up the slack, Mr. Skurikhin said, to keep vodka flowing.
Russians in the vodka business were nonplused.
"Russian vodka not produced in Russia?" said Pavel Shapkin, chairman of Russia's National Alcohol Association. "I think that will be a problem."

HEADLINE: Is The Observer for Sale? Always, At a Dollar Apiece, Its Owner Says 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
One can be forgiven for speculating about Arthur L. Carter and his plans for The New York Observer. After all, who doesn't speculate? The salmon-pink bundle of news and attitude preys on the imagination and fears of powerful New Yorkers in a way that few other publications of its size -- it says it has a circulation of about 50,000 -- can match. 
 When it expanded with an extra section about three years ago, there were rumors that Mr. Carter was thinking of selling The Observer, a weekly that he had dedicated to the proposition that all men -- and some women -- are created pretentious, and that puncturing those pretensions is worth losing a few million dollars every year. 
 Now that he has been cutting the staff, the heft of the paper and even its physical size, the rumors are back: that he is consumed with sculpturing and does not care about the newspaper; or that his sale of The Litchfield County Times, the paper in the genteel reaches of central Connecticut, where celebrities go to hide and to buy high-end garden equipment, just goes to show that he does not care about newspapers anymore.
Even Mr. Carter speculates about his own intentions. In a recent interview, the sometimes reticent financier-turned-publisher said: "My commercial side is stronger than I wish it were. I wish I were less commercial. But you can't change your spots. So from time to time the commercial side rears its ugly head and says: 'Why are you losing all this money? Your father would have had a fit.' Do I say that to myself from time to time? Absolutely."
The last time he said it often, the newspaper almost ended up in the hands of Conrad M. Black, the chief executive of Hollinger International, the Canadian publishing giant. That courtship fell apart at the altar, and Mr. Black is now a backer of The New York Sun, a daily newspaper scheduled to start publication this spring. 
Reminiscing about his six-year dalliance with Mr. Black, Mr. Carter concluded by saying that he intends to keep The Observer for himself. For now.
Not that anybody really believes it. After all, Mr. Carter sold The Litchfield County Times last year, and The Nation, a liberal magazine, in 1995. Representatives of at least three of the city's major investment banking firms have come calling in the past three months, since the rumors heated up, looking to broker a deal, according to representatives of those firms, who spoke on condition that their names not be used. 
"There's always been people circling The Observer," Mr. Carter said. "A lot of bees circle the paper and say, 'Is Carter selling the newspaper?' We get inquiries from time to time from brokers and investment bankers." This time around, he said, the rumors were a logical outgrowth of a period when advertisers have gone to ground and one publication after another has closed.
"I'm sure it had to do with the very poor economic climate, a poor advertising climate. The closing of Talk and Brill's Content and Mademoiselle. And we're making cuts like everyone else, because our revenues are down 15 percent." Then, in a humorous voice that seemed proud and disgusted in equal measure, he added, "We're a small organization, but when we lay off three people it's bigger news here than when U.S. Steel lays off 20,000."
He added that 15 years ago, when he started The Observer near the end of the next-to-last big economic boom, in the 1980's, he had some hopes of making money. "I don't think I went into it necessarily thinking I would make a lot of money. I hoped I would, and hope springs eternal."
After 15 years?
"Well, after 15 years, you begin to feel you are destined to be a publication that never makes money. You're like Harvard, Yale and Princeton."
But they have endowments, don't they?
"The Observer has an endowment. Me. I'm the endowment."
And how many endowment directors have the pleasure of fielding angry calls from leading politicians, or being told off at dinner parties by the likes of Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the publisher of The Daily News and a habitual subject of Observer articles that are habitually unflattering.
All of which, of course, would suggest that Mr. Carter, 70, has given up his plans to sell the newspaper. Not exactly. Minority partners, he said, are always an option. And, asked if he would say flatly that he never intends to sell it and devote himself only to his other vocation, sculpturing, Mr. Carter said quickly:
"I could say it. I'm not sure it would be true. The answer is: I don't have an intent to sell it for the foreseeable future.
"I love what it does. I'm not sure -- I've had conversations with people who say, 'You could stay on and own a piece of it.' We've had those conversations."
But in the end, he said, "anyone who owns 51 percent can tell you goodbye." He added, "If you want to guarantee that you're working on a day-to-day basis, you can't sell it."
The economic pain of producing The Observer is likely to stay sharp. The New York Sun may write about different things -- more school vouchers, less Hamptons real estate -- but it is aiming for an intelligent audience that wants an alternative to The New York Times, The New York Post and The Daily News. That makes the new daily newspaper a competitor.
"Anyone who is going after ad dollars or subscription dollars is a competitor," Mr. Carter said. "For some period of time they are going to be taking business from those of us who have it."
Does that increase the likelihood that he will find his sculpture -- which doesn't talk back -- a more desirable companion than his journalists? "There are practicalities in life," he said. "If I didn't have the resources to support The Observer, I wouldn't do it. As long as the resources are there, I will do it."

HEADLINE: R and R for an Old Fort; 
A Harbor Outpost Faces Renovation as a Resort

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: FORT HANCOCK, N.J., March 1 

 BODY:
Like a column of tired old soldiers eager to brag of faded glories, the brick centurions that housed generations of military men here are proud, imposing, but withered by time, their sagging rooflines and rotting porches hinting of a more regal past. 
 Built at the mouth of New York Harbor as a bulwark against maritime invaders, Fort Hancock was the premier fortification for the nation's premier city and port. The British found this sandy spit invaluable when they seized Manhattan in 1776. So did the Eisenhower-era tacticians who placed Nike missiles in the dunes in the 1950's, a potential foil to Soviet warplanes. 
 But since 1974, when the Pentagon deactivated this Army base at the tip of Sandy Hook and handed it over to the National Park Service, most of Fort Hancock's colonial-style barracks, stables and gun batteries have been mothballed, awaiting the bold ideas and federal largess that would bring them back to life. For 28 years, the public financing failed to materialize and rehabilitation schemes died amid concerns that the wrong kind of development would ruin an astounding relic of American military history. 
Now, faced with the rapid decay of more than 280 structures, the National Park Service has chosen a private developer to transform Fort Hancock into a combination resort, office center and cultural hub, all set amid the 19th-century buildings that housed thousands of soldiers between the Spanish-American and Vietnam Wars.
No suburban office park, the 140-acre sand-and-lawn campus would be swept with delicious sea breezes in the summer and icy gusts in the winter. On clear days, it would have faraway views of the Lower Manhattan skyline. Water, of course, would be visible at every turn, and frequent ferries would connect Fort Hancock to the city, 45 minutes away.
The plan by Sandy Hook Partners of Middletown, N.J., was chosen from among 22 proposals, some of which envisioned golf courses, skeet-shooting platforms, housing for the elderly and conference centers. Mindful of potential critics, park officials point out that the winning project would neither remove existing structures nor add new ones, except for a maintenance garage and a building modeled on a handsome hospital that burned two decades ago.
"This place is really a hidden jewel," said Richard E. Wells, Fort Hancock's deputy superintendent, looking across the windswept parade grounds. "But if we don't act quickly, these buildings will continue to deteriorate and they could be lost forever."
With $5 billion in park service projects languishing across the country, Mr. Wells said, there was little hope that Congress would provide the $60 million to $90 million needed to restore Fort Hancock. "It's not like the American people have that kind of money in their back pocket," he said. "We can't do this alone."
So far, there has been little criticism of the proposed plan, which faces a modest approval process. Some environmentalists have expressed concern that 800 additional cars and the 1,500 people who will be drawn to the new Fort Hancock could harm a fragile ecosystem. Others are uncomfortable with the privatization of national park land.
"Sandy Hook is basically an unreinforced sandbar and the last piece of undeveloped coastline within 55 miles of New York," said Brian Unger, regional director of the Surfers' Environmental Alliance. "More cars, more parking lots and more people can't be good for it."
Most, however, say the park service has been careful to balance history, economics and the environment. "Other than just abandoning or bulldozing the place, we see this is a good fit," said Ray Cosgrove, president of the Sandy Hook Foundation, which works to preserve the peninsula's delicate flora as well as Fort Hancock's decaying structures. Over the years, the group has helped restore the camp's W.P.A.-era theater and a lighthouse, built in 1764, that is the country's oldest. "My feeling is that the National Park Service loves this place as much as we do," Mr. Cosgrove said.
Ground could be broken as early as fall of 2002.
Army veterans who served at Fort Hancock are eagerly awaiting its rebirth as well. Al Zwiazek, 83, who spent three years here during the late 1930's, still comes with his wife for nostalgic drives through the grounds. "Oh, it was a busy place," he said, speaking from his home in Garfield, N.J. "It was a self-contained world, but it could also be cold and desolate." 
Mr. Zwiazek, who arrived here as an 18-year-old infantryman, recalled visits by Charles Lindbergh, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He also remembers the day in 1937 when the doomed Hindenburg floated overhead on its way to Lakehurst. 
Although the United States military began fortifications during the War of 1812, much of what remains was built in 1898, all of it dressed in a sober colonial revival uniform. Most striking is the orderly procession of mustard-colored houses that stand along Sandy Hook Bay, their wooden porches well positioned for sunset viewing. Three of the 18 houses will be turned into boutique inns and others will find a new life as offices. A nearby mule barn, hay still strewn around its stalls, will become a restaurant for day trippers. 
Behind "Officers Row" and scattered around the parade grounds are an assortment of matching structures: mess halls, a chapel, a bowling alley, a post office and barracks for nearly 1,000 men. One of the most impressive structures, the Officers Club, is a rambling ruin overlooking the Atlantic, its floors buckled by water damage, the tin ceilings rusted from years of salt spray. Built in 1878, the building will become a bed and breakfast, with about a dozen rooms above and an upscale restaurant below in the former ballroom. 
"I'm stunned by the condition but amazed by the beauty," said Jim Wassel, the head of Sandy Hook Partners. As he descended the double staircase, mounds of paint flakes crunched underfoot. Mr. Wassel, a veteran developer, had a hand in historical restorations like those of Faneuil Hall in Boston and South Street Seaport in New York.
According to his plan, one-third of the fort's structures will be leased to commercial tenants and cultural groups, while another third will be kept by the half-dozen maritime and environmental organizations that have been using them for years. The last third will be retained by the park service for offices and staff housing. 
At its peak during World War II, as many as 12,000 soldiers stayed here before shipping off to Europe. Thousands of others, elated and exhausted, arrived at Fort Hancock after V-E Day. It was an all-male world until 1942, when the Army established the Women's Army Corps, whose members began filling slots as dental assistants, secretaries and mess hall cooks. 
The edges of Fort Hancock are sprinkled with concrete gun batteries from the days when Sandy Hook was one of the nation's foremost proving grounds for new weapons; a Nike missile site is one of the park's biggest draws. Mr. Zwiazek said the thud of exploding ordnance and the smell of gunpowder were almost always in the air. "We used to keep the windows open; otherwise the concussion would break the glass," he said. "We'd often have cotton in our ears." 
Much of the area where artillery shells once fell is now precious habitat for piping plovers and ospreys, and for rare plants like wild wormwood. As part of the development, park officials will restore the natural landscape by turning a former rail yard into habitat for nesting birds. Windmills, wastewater recycling and a natural gas pipeline are to be introduced as part of an environment-friendly development package. 
As a merciless wind howled through an empty barracks earlier in the week, Mr. Wells acknowledged that working or staying at Fort Hancock in winter might not appeal to everyone. Still, for those accustomed to working in jam-packed Manhattan or suburban office pods, there is nothing like a desk with an ocean view, he said. "Sure it can be gray and miserable; the wind cuts through you," he said, making his way across the parade ground. "But isn't it exhilarating?"

HEADLINE: Pocketing Soft Money Till Pocket Is Sewn Up 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3 

 BODY:
With the Senate likely to approve landmark restrictions on political fund-raising and with Congress up for grabs, Republicans and Democrats are mounting an aggressive, last-ditch drive to collect unrestricted checks from wealthy donors before such donations are banned.
 The Republicans are exploiting three marquee figures to attract the large contributions: a popular wartime president, his strategically reclusive vice president and an iconic former mayor of New York. 
 The schedule for President Bush includes two fund-raising events a week for the next few months. Last week, he went to North Carolina, where he headlined a $1 million lunch, and Iowa, and on Monday he travels to Minnesota.
Vice President Dick Cheney, fresh from a dinner at which he raised $1 million from 35 couples for the California Republican Party, is on a similar drive. He has scheduled some 60 fund-raising events from now to November, or about two a week. 
Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has become one of the most sought-after fund-raisers in Republican history, welcomed in places where no New York mayor, in office or out, has raised money before. He is headlining a "Salute to America's Heroes" this month to raise $5 million for House Republicans. 
Lest anyone think it unseemly for them to use their sky-high approval ratings from the war to light up the money circuit, Mr. Bush now routinely brings up the subject.
"Somebody said to me the other day, or actually asked me today, am I going to campaign?" Mr. Bush said on Wednesday at the fund-raising lunch in North Carolina. "Here we are in a war, do you think it's all right for the president to go campaign?"
"Yes," he said simply. "I do."
Driven by a hunger for a Republican Congress, bolstered by unusually high approval ratings and fully aware that the door could close on the big donations known as soft money, the Bush-Cheney-Giuliani triumvirate is striking while the iron is hot. They are raising both the big soft money -- which includes donations from corporations, unions and the wealthy -- and smaller, more regulated contributions for an array of candidates and state parties. 
"This may be the last year to reap those unlimited soft-money donations," said Larry Makinson, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, "and you can bet both parties are doing absolutely everything they can." Mr. Makinson added, "It's like last call at the bar, and it's going to last for eight months."
Democrats, who usually lag in fund-raising, are also in overdrive. The bill before the Senate, if signed into law, would go into effect after this year's Congressional elections.
"One of the few things the parties have in common is we're making a huge, huge push on fund-raising," said Maria Cordova, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. The Democrats' big draw? Bill Clinton, scheduled for a spring gala at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
Even some of the Democrats' most ardent proponents of eliminating soft money are unabashed.
"We've got to play by the rules we have now," Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader and one such opponent, said as Democrats took in more than $4.5 million last week at a $10,000-a-head dinner featuring Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, who gave the Democrats the majority when he switched from Republican to independent.
"And the rules are that soft money will be part of the campaign of 2002," Mr. Daschle said. "I'm not going to tie one or both arms behind my back and expect to compete effectively with my Republican colleagues."
If the Senate gives final passage this month to a wide-ranging change in campaign law, it will be a watershed moment in a long struggle. The bill, championed by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, would radically change the campaign finance system, leaving all sides uncertain which party would ultimately benefit.
The bill would prohibit the national political parties from accepting the kinds of donations they have increasingly come to rely on. It would also restrict outside groups from running thinly disguised campaign commercials for or against a particular candidate 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election.
In exchange for eliminating soft money, the bill would allow increases in smaller, more tightly regulated contributions, known as hard money, for the first time since 1974.
Individuals would be able to give $2,000 per election to candidates instead of $1,000, and the top limits would increase with inflation. Other limits would also rise. For example, a person would be allowed to give up to $95,000, spread among candidates and political parties, in each two-year election cycle, instead of the current $25,000 in a year.
State and local parties would be able to take donations of up to $10,000 per year per person for vote drives.
This is far from the first time Congress has tried to cut ties between special interests and politics. Since 1907, when Theodore Roosevelt signed into law a ban on contributions by corporations and banks, Congress has made sporadic efforts to control the flow of big money.
Usually the impulse is born of scandal. The last successful push for change came in 1974, after the disclosures of Richard M. Nixon's illicit fund-raising. Congress enacted the most comprehensive campaign regulatory system ever, an intricate system of checks and balances.
To stop wealthy interests from buying access, the law put into place an array of caps on contributions, including a limit of $1,000 per election on donations to federal candidates by individuals. To ease the pressure to raise money, it set limits on candidate spending.
The law also provided some public financing for presidential elections. The Federal Election Commission was created to police the bill's mandates that all contributions above $200 be fully and publicly disclosed.
But the system began to unravel quickly because of court cases, regulatory rulings, Congress and ever more inventive politicians, interest groups and financiers. As political operatives contemplate this year's proposed restrictions, there are already predictions that new loopholes will be found to subvert the law. 
After the 1974 changes, the Supreme Court struck down spending limits as an unconstitutional infringement on free speech unless candidates voluntarily accepted them to qualify for public financing.
The decision put federal candidates in a relentless money chase. Spending limits vanished, but limits on raising money remained. The parties and candidates soon found a way around these strictures: soft money.
A 1978 ruling by the elections agency opened the door for the parties to use corporate and union funds for party-building activities, like get-out-the-vote drives. This so-called soft money was not to be spent directly to aid particular federal candidates.
It took some time for the parties to exploit this loophole. But by the 1988 presidential election, big money was back. The Republican candidate, Mr. Bush's father, and his Democratic opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, benefited from donor clubs of $100,000 contributors established by the Republican and Democratic National Committees. The parties raised $45 million in soft money that year.
In 1996, President Clinton took soft-money fund-raising to new heights. He held dinners with $100,000 donors. He rewarded donors with overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom.
"The reality is that now we really have expenditure limits in name only in federal elections," said David B. Magleby, a campaign finance scholar and dean of social sciences at Brigham Young University.
The 1996 election brought another significant change. Mr. Clinton and his campaign adviser Dick Morris pioneered an aggressive use of soft money, for party issue advertising, that helped the president build a formidable early lead over Bob Dole in 1995. His lawyers contended that the use of $32 million in soft money for such advertisements was legal because the commercials stopped just short of saying, "Vote for Bill Clinton." In 1996, Mr. Dole followed suit, turning to the Republican Party to broadcast more than $20 million in issue advertisements on his behalf.
By the last presidential election, the parties had raised nearly $500 million in soft money, a record. Losing all that money is bound to be wrenching; indeed many Republicans argue that the power of the national parties will be sharply reduced in a post-soft-money world.
"At the end of the day, said Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican and chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, afund-raising vehicle, "what it's really doing is cutting the power of both of them in half." 
The parties are already trying to increase their smaller, hard-dollar bases. This will pose a particular challenge to Democrats, who have had more trouble raising such funds.
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, conceded that his party was at a disadvantage against such a proven fund-raiser as Mr. Bush. But he added, "That stuff doesn't scare me."
Like the Republicans, the Democrats have been preparing for the day the national parties can no longer raise soft money. Mr. McAuliffe said Democrats were shifting focus from glittery top-dollar events to a more grass-roots, targeted approach.
One person who probably will not be hurt by the changes is Mr. Bush. In 2000, he proved such a potent fund-raiser that he did not take federal matching funds for his campaign. He still raised more money than his Democratic opponent, Al Gore.
Some fund-raisers expect the biggest change to be that the large contributions now going directly to the parties will instead go to ideological groups aligned with them, like the National Rifle Association or the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Or the money could go through special committees set up especially to raise money for television commercials.
"This money doesn't dry up," said Representative Thomas M. Davis III, the Virginia Republican who leads the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. "It stays there. Instead of going to the parties, it goes somewhere else."
Steve Rosenthal, the political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., one of the most effective forces in politics, agreed. "For those who want to give, there will always be ways of giving," Mr. Rosenthal said. 
Mr. McCain acknowledged that clever campaign lawyers and donors were likely to find ways around his bill in future years. "There will be a period of time of relatively clean elections -- I emphasize relative -- and then we will find some smart people who find smart ways around it," he said.
That, he predicted, will simply spawn another drive to clean up the system. "Twenty years from now," he said, "there will be two more senators who will be arguing for reform because we've gone continuously through cycles of corruption and reform."

Those Jaunty Issues Of the New Economy Take a Sober Turn

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Few things age faster than the future, and few things embody that fact more acutely than the September 2000 issue of Red Herring. 
 A brawny artifact of a bygone era, the issue weighed in at 552 ad-stuffed pages -- more than two pounds of hubris that would kill a small cat if it fell off a table. Its cover was anchored by an Oz-like Bill Gates, and both the ads and editorial content announced that the geeks had triumphed. The prebust issue of the magazine was a temple to what one of its stories called "a style of business pioneered in Silicon Valley, but it's now practiced everywhere: sunny, optimistic and endlessly creative." 
 Poof.
The March 2002 issue of Red Herring features Bill Gates's second, Steven A. Ballmer, in a wedding dress, to suggest he has been left at the altar by technology.
He's not the only one. The March issue, all 6.5 ounces of it, runs a scant 100 pages, and that includes public-service ads for the Girl Scouts and the United Way, along with 6 pages of the magazine advertising itself. One of its main features tells how investors are in open revolt against venture capitalists who have thrown their money down a digital rat hole.
Having set down the pom-poms that were very much a part of technology-sector coverage, the spate of magazines that lived off the Internet boom have turned into a journalistic rust belt, lurching in search of not just survival, but a compelling story. Magazines that had celebrated the limitlessness of human endeavors are now a sober, stern read tracking the broader business climate with charts where all the graphs go down and pictures where the subjects raise their right hand to testify.
The fizzy vocabulary that had become part of the genre is now of little use in telling the stories of Cisco's inventory debacle, the evaporation of investment and the unwillingness of traditional businesses to hire dot-com veterans. There is really no enjoyable way to talk about a trip to the gallows, after all.
In a generally brutal publishing economy, special punishment has been reserved for the new-economy magazines. The Industry Standard, the sector's weekly bible -- and ironically the most skeptical in its coverage -- died an early death last summer that now looks like a mercy killing. Business 2.0 died and was promptly married to Time Inc.'s unfortunately named eCompany Now, which promptly took on the acquired's name. Fast Company, which was always more about human capital than venture capital, is still stuck with a bandwidth of buzzwords that seem quaint in the current context. Red Herring is covering a venture capital community that is busy sitting on its wallet, while Upside is finding out that downside is a very tough thing to cover.
Even so, the bull market in optimism -- Silicon Valley's most durable export -- continues. As it turns out, their editors say, these next-generation business magazines were never just about the new economy.
"Our magazine did more to sort of highlight the stupidities of what was going on than just about any other magazine," said the editor and president of Business 2.0, Ned Desmond. "The big question now is how do you do business well?" Or in the instance of the March issue of Business 2.0, how to do it without going to jail. "Why would anyone believe you?" asks a cover story about Enron and corporate credibility, illustrated with a Pinocchio-nosed Kenneth L. Lay.
That is a fair question as well for a magazine that offered up Enron's Jeffrey K. Skilling as a revolutionary just last September. Mr. Desmond chose to address the issue directly in his editor's note, saying that the magazine "just plain got suckered. For that we apologize."
Mr. Desmond's note is a breathtaking acknowledgment. People have historically bought tech-oriented magazines to help see over the hill, and the serial apologies that now run through coverage do little to inspire reader confidence in that mission.
Technology reporters often felt like they were part of what they were covering, and that is one hard fact that has not changed. The crash they covered landed on them as well. The survivors now have a much less interesting beat; after all, there are just so many eBays to go around. 
All the eat-your-vegetables tutorials can make for dreary reading. In Business 2.0, the Brazen Careerist column suggests that the reader "set your sights lower or you will be unemployed long after the unemployment checks stop coming." So much for the Brand Called You.
What remains is an exercise in journalistic taxidermy, stuffing the carcass of the digital economy with lessons learned. "The story of technologically driven business as the pre-eminent feature of American culture is gone," said John Battelle, the former chairman of Standard Media International.
Mr. Desmond argues that "the magazine has a much deeper mission than to just grab a hold of the zeitgeist," pointing to the success of Gruner+Jahr USA Publishing's Fast Company as an indication that "the audience of business readers has changed dramatically. They came out of the blue with a radically different approach and something clicked."
Fast Company's emphasis on cultural, rather than technological, engines of change has made for a softer landing. The magazine continues to add readers, even as its ad base and most of its profit erode.
"Our fundamental mission," said Alan M. Webber, a founding co-editor, "is to help people make sense out of the rapidly changing business, give them the tools to compete and help them see what was coming next before it got here."
Red Herring, christened in less serious times, now sounds like a prescient name. The magazine, like so many of the venture capitalists it features, remains in search of the next big whatever. "Even some economists say that a wider use of broadband could lead the U.S. economy out of recession," it says in arguing for a Marshall Plan for government-financed info highways.
Jason Pontin, editor of Red Herring, said his magazine is agnostic about specific technologies and is finding good articles by following the money that is being invested.
"We are covering stories that rival the Internet," Mr. Pontin said. "Changes in biotech and nanotech that will shift the paradigm."
Upside's chief executive, John Carroll, says, hopefully, that the darkest hour is over. "So many bad things have happened at once in this area of publishing, that it's bound to get better," he said. "It has been like the guy who goes into the hospital to get a broken leg treated and after he gets fixed up, he comes walking out of the hospital and gets run over by a car. How many times is that going to happen?"

HEADLINE: Bush Weighs Raising Steel Tariffs But Exempting Most Poor Nations 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3 

 BODY:
President Bush's top economic advisers have presented him with proposals to rescue the American steel industry that would most heavily penalize China, Japan, Germany, Taiwan and South Korea, but exempt most poor nations -- and Mexico and Canada -- from punishing tariffs.
 With Mr. Bush facing a deadline that requires him to announce a decision by Wednesday, the advisers are seeking a way for him to argue that he is making good on his campaign promises to ailing steel makers and steelworkers, particularly in states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio that are vital to the Republicans in this year's Congressional election. 
 But the proposals Mr. Bush is considering fall well short of what some of America's largest steel makers and union workers have demanded: 40 percent tariffs on virtually all steel products from abroad. 
That could raise the price of steel by roughly 10 percent, saving jobs in a long-beleaguered industry in which bankruptcy has become a way of life, but also pushing up the cost of cars, washing machines and other consumer goods. Some Bush advisers have warned that the high tariffs would have the same effect on the economy as higher taxes.
Mr. Bush appears set to reject industry efforts to have the government assume the pension and health liabilities of failed steel makers, a move that U.S. Steel has urged to speed mergers that would consolidate the industry. He will, however, leave the door open for Congress to bail out those workers so that they keep their retirement benefits.
As word trickled out that the administration was looking for ways to soften the tariffs, the chief executive of U.S. Steel, Thomas J. Usher, warned in an interview this weekend that this was not the time for timidity -- even if Mr. Bush risks angering countries critical to his antiterrorism coalition.
"If there are a lot of holes in the president's plan, if you exclude the developing nations and Canada and Mexico and maybe Russia, then we will end up with a weak solution," Mr. Usher said. "And a weak solution won't save the industry or the jobs."
Rarely has Mr. Bush faced such a delicate economic decision. He is weighing the costs of keeping Americans employed -- one of his most impassioned current themes -- against the inevitable charges from conservatives that he is violating free-market ideals. European leaders, already angered by Mr. Bush's "axis of evil" references, have left no doubt that they will immediately challenge his decision as a violation of world trade rules, and try to have the World Trade Organization overturn it.
Mr. Bush has been sympathetic to the argument that American security hinges on preserving the steel industry. Advocates of strong presidential action are trying to use that sentiment to their advantage. 
"Our weapons are made of steel," Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee, told a cheering crowd of steelworkers Thursday, before going to the White House to make another appeal. "We go to war with what you make."
To achieve Mr. Bush's political objectives while minimizing the impact on some influential industries that use steel, the president's advisers are recommending an array of tariffs, after a careful examination of what countries they would hurt and what companies -- and swing states -- they might help. Most options fall short of steel makers' demand for 40 percent across-the-board tariffs.
Some of the steepest tariffs, for example, may be applied to a type of steel produced by Weirton Steel, one of the largest employers in West Virginia, a state Mr. Bush won after steelworkers there declared that President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had betrayed them. That tariff would sharply limit imports of tin mill steel from China, Taiwan, South Korea and Brazil.
But advisers have also suggested more modest restraints on steel slab, used by smaller West Coast companies, and steel flanges, used by Detroit automakers. 
Mr. Usher warned over the weekend that this would be "a major mistake," because foreign companies would bring steel slab into the United States if tariffs were low enough, then fabricate it into competitive products.
Mr. Bush must decide by Wednesday to meet a deadline set by the International Trade Commission. In recent rulings, the commission found that a surge in steel imports had threatened American industry. But statistics show that the surge tapered off after the 1998 Asian economic crisis, even though a continuing glut of steel has kept prices low.
The issue is so complex, splitting steelworkers against makers of other goods, steel making states against steel importing states, and representatives of workers against free-trade advocates, that the arguments have crossed party lines. Republicans themselves are deeply divided.
In recent days Mr. Bush has been besieged by members of Congress seeking protection for their workers, while conservatives have warned against interfering with the global market. His political advisers, led by Karl Rove, have argued that Mr. Bush must prove he is a "compassionate conservative," worried more about workers than about ideological purity.
Today, speaking on NBC, both the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, and the minority leader, Trent Lott, said they supported action by Mr. Bush, but Mr. Daschle called for the highest tariffs -- a step Bill Clinton declined to take. "If we're serious about having free trade, then we've got to make sure we also have fair trade, and we don't have fair trade in steel today," Mr. Daschle said.
But their next comments indicated that pressure on Mr. Bush would not end when the steel decision was made. 
Mr. Daschle, from South Dakota, a farm state, called for protection for American farmers, and Mr. Lott, from Mississippi, said the timber industry needed to be shielded.
Even Mr. Bush's trade experts say that an important element of building support for free trade is showing that he will use all legal tools to stop surges of foreign goods that eliminate American jobs.
"To promote open trade, an administration has to be willing to seriously consider using the trade laws available," Mr. Bush's chief trade adviser, Robert B. Zoellick, said in an interview. While it may not be possible to stop the slow decline of old-line industries, he said, "if you've got tools to help people get back on their feet, you should try to do so."
When Mr. Bush drove through Pennsylvania's industrial heartland recently, Senator Arlen Specter spent 40 minutes with him discussing the plight of local steelworkers and U.S. Steel. His message was that nothing less than 40 percent tariffs would help.
"I told him that halfway measures are not going to do the job," Mr. Specter said. 
Other Republicans are pushing back, however. John McCain of Arizona wrote to Mr. Bush on Friday, citing a study concluding that tariff increases could cost 86,000 American jobs in industries that use steel -- 13 times the number they would save.
For a president who has repeatedly urged the dismantling of trade barriers, protecting steel makers poses some foreign policy risks.
Officials expect a heated backlash from European and Asian trading partners. Mexico and Canada will probably retain full access for their steel makers because the North American Free Trade Agreement would require compensation to them for lost sales. Mr. Bush will also decide whether to exempt many poor countries, perhaps including South Africa and Brazil, whose support is considered essential in global trade talks.
Whatever the risks, Mr. Bush seems determined to help steel. As many as 31 steel makers have declared bankruptcy since the Asian crisis in 1998. The price of basic steel products has fallen by about half in recent years, by some accounts to its all-time lowest level in inflation-adjusted terms. Even the World Trade Organization allows members to safeguard vulnerable industries temporarily -- though it is far from clear whether its judges will back the Bush approach.
The political calculus also favors action. Companies that use steel have campaigned aggressively to head off tariffs, as have port operators in states like Louisiana and Florida that depend on steel imports. But they do not speak as loudly -- or carry as big an electoral stick -- as steel makers and their workers.
That was evident on Thursday, when thousands of workers gathered outside the White House. Richard Marty, a steelworker who had come by bus from Ohio, waved a banner that read, "We need 40 percent by George."
Mr. Rove has been seeking to forge a tight bond with steelworkers, and Mr. Marty offered hope. A longtime Democrat, he said he was considering switching his party allegiance if Mr. Bush made the right call. "I can be swung," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Argentina Fight Over Honey 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MARULL, Argentina 

 BODY:
Scores of angry bees are swarming around his head, but Juan Jose Baudino doesn't seem to mind. It is harvest time here on the pampas, and as he moves from hive to hive, removing trays to check the production and health of his bee colonies, sticky, golden honey oozes from the combs.
 A few miles down the road, a gleaming new processing plant, financed by contributions from hundreds of local beekeepers, is also buzzing with activity. There, gallon after gallon of honey is separated from wax, either to be bottled and trucked to supermarkets in Buenos Aires or poured into 55-gallon metal drums and shipped to Germany, France and Spain. 
 Abroad, Argentina's image is of a country unable to compete globally and intent on protecting its inefficient local producers. The Bush administration has been especially critical, citing Argentina's supposed unwillingness to compete as a main cause of its economic crisis. 
"They don't have any export industry to speak of at all," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said dismissively in an interview with the magazine The Economist last summer. "And they like it that way."
But here on the humid pampas, where fields of alfalfa and clover stretch to the horizon, the emergence of a flourishing honey industry belies that notion. In little more than a decade, Argentina has become the world's leading exporter of honey, selling nearly 90,000 tons a year to foreign markets, with almost half of it going to the United States.
The United States, however, has not greeted this with praise or support. Instead, responding to complaints of dumping by American honey producers (complaints that honey importers in the United States call unfounded), it placed tariffs of up to 66 percent on Argentine honey, effectively shutting it out of the market.
The decision, which went into effect in November, has dealt a serious blow to an industry that earned $86.6 million in much-needed foreign exchange in 2000 and provides a livelihood to thousands of farmers. Though the Argentine government has done little to mount a defense or appeal, officials argue that Argentine beekeepers are being unfairly punished for being more efficient.
"What's really going on is that they don't want to buy from us," Jose Ignacio de Mendiguren, the new minister of production, said in an interview in Buenos Aires. "Argentina is a large and very competitive exporter in the agricultural sector, but we're matched against agricultural economies in the United States and Europe that not only close their borders to us, but subsidize the same products that we make.
"If they really wanted to help Argentina, what they would do is not so much lend us money, but let us sell what we produce," Mr. de Mendiguren said of the Bush administration.
"This always happens. It happened with lemons too. Whatever Argentina is capable of exporting, we know that the United States will administer its own trade in such a way as to be able to protect its own producers at our expense."
Argentina's position is largely shared by honey importers in the United States. Nicholas Sargeantson, president of Sunland International, an importer in New Canaan, Conn., said Argentine honey was "of a very high quality," adding that some packers prefer it to domestic honey because it is cleaner.
The Commerce Department ruling against Argentina illustrates "the immense hypocrisy of U.S. trade law," he added.
"On the one hand, the U.S. advocates to the world to tear down trade barriers," he said, "but on the other it has these wonderfully convenient dumping laws which enable domestic producers to bring a case against foreign suppliers any time they see competition they don't like."
The main honey producer in this dairy region of north-central Argentina is a nonprofit federation of cooperatives known as FCJAC SanCor. Founded in 1985, largely with a $500,000 loan from the United States-supported Inter-American Development Bank, it set a goal of providing opportunities for poor farmworkers.
"Nobody knew much about beekeeping when we started, but it seemed to be the perfect complement to cattle raising," the traditional economic backbone of the region, said Oscar Paira, the cooperative's manager. "Beekeeping didn't require space or food, so it seemed to be a way to get a big result from a small investment."
Mr. Baudino, a 40-year-old father of two, was an early and enthusiastic supporter, seeing it as his only way to progress. The son of a windmill repairman, he began with 20 hives and a $2,000 loan and today owns nearly 1,000 hives.
"When I started, I had just gotten married and had nothing at all," said Mr. Baudino, who estimates his family income at $12,500 a year. "I'm not rich by any means, but to go from nothing to where I am now in just 16 years is quite a feat in Argentina, and I owe it all to honey."
The American dumping complaint baffles beekeepers here, who tend to be small producers of limited means and education and no experience with accountants and lawyers. The United States began its investigation by giving producers and exporters 30 days to answer a nearly 150-page questionnaire in English, but because they could not understand English, failed to realize what was at stake or had incomplete records, the beekeepers did not respond.
In the absence of what it considered a satisfactory response from beekeepers, American auditors were authorized to turn to "the best available evidence." That turned out to be a magazine article that producers and exporters here say was riddled with errors and false assumptions.
"It's absurd to think that we somehow determine international prices for honey," Mr. Paira said. "It's the market, in particular the United States, that does that. And as small producers, we couldn't possibly remain in business if we were selling below the cost of production."
Another key element was tax rebates that American honey producers called an unfair subsidy. But producers here say the government is so bankrupt it has been years since they received state support.
"It's not just that these subsidies don't exist, but that we have to pay all kinds of taxes that weren't taken into consideration in the evaluation of the complaint," said Fernando Esteban, a producer with 200 hives who is also editor of the country's leading beekeeping magazine.
In a telephone interview from Bruce, S.D., Richard L. Adee, president of the American Honey Producers Association, dismissed the Argentine accusations. "They were unable to prove that they weren't dumping," he said, and thus deserve to be penalized to the extent permitted under American law. "Everybody has an equal opportunity to defend themselves, and if they don't want to do that, they have to accept the consequences."
For producers here, incomes have dropped from $1,150 a ton to $950. "We had the same amount of honey to sell, the middlemen knew we had to sell it, and with one less market to sell it to, they were able to take advantage of the situation and drive down the price," Mr. Paira said.
At the same time, wholesale prices are rising rapidly in the United States, importers say. In just a few months, the cost of a pound of white honey has gone from 50 cents a pound to 80 cents, reflecting the inability of honey users to fill the gap left by the disappearance of Argentine honey.
"We really don't have a clue how we're going to meet the requirements of the U.S. packing industry over the next 12 months," Mr. Sargeantson, the president of Sunland International, said. "What we have now is a situation that I've never seen before in 27 years in this business, one that in the long run is going to benefit nobody."

HEADLINE: Breaking the Contract 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If converting Social Security to a system of private retirement accounts is such a good idea, why can't advocates of that conversion try, just once, to make their case without insisting that 1+1=4?
 Last week George W. Bush did it again, contrasting Social Security benefits with what retiring workers would have if they had invested all their Social Security taxes in the stock market instead. As an article in The Times pointed out, this was a misleading scenario even on its own terms; financial planners strongly advise against investing solely in stocks, and a diversified retirement account wouldn't have risen nearly as much in the 1990's bull market. 
 But there's something much more serious wrong with Mr. Bush's story. Indeed, the latest remarks perfectly illustrate how he uses bogus comparisons to make private accounts sound like a much better idea than they really are. For by emphasizing what today's 65-year-olds could have done if they hadn't paid Social Security taxes, Mr. Bush has forgotten something rather important. Without those taxes, who would have paid for their parents' benefits? 
 The point is that when touting its plan to privatize Social Security, the Bush administration conveniently fails to mention the system's existing obligations, the debt it owes to older Americans. As with so many other administration proposals, private accounts are being sold with deceptive advertising. 
 The truth -- which Mr. Bush's economists understand perfectly well -- is that Social Security has never been run like a simple pension fund. It's really a social contract: each generation pays taxes that support the previous generation's retirement, and expects to receive the same treatment from the next generation.
 You may believe that Franklin Roosevelt should never have created this system in the first place. I disagree, but in any case Social Security exists, and older Americans have upheld their end of the bargain. In particular, baby boomers have spent their working years paying quite high payroll taxes, which were used mainly to support their elders, and only secondarily to help Social Security build up a financial reserve. And they expect to be supported in their turn.
 Mr. Bush proposes to allow younger workers to place their payroll taxes in private accounts -- in effect, to break this ongoing contract. But then what happens to older workers, who have already paid their dues? 
 There are only two possibilities. One is default: make room for the trillions diverted into private accounts by slashing the baby boomers' benefits. The other is to buy the baby boomers out -- that is, to use money from other sources to replace the diverted funds. 
 Those really are the only alternatives. Last year the special commission on reform of Social Security, which was charged with producing a plan for private accounts, came to an ignominious end -- it issued a deliberately confusing report, then slunk quietly out of town. But wade through its menu of options, and you'll find that in the end the commission grudgingly rediscovered the obvious: Private accounts won't "save" Social Security. On the contrary, they will create a financing crisis, requiring sharp benefit cuts, large infusions of money from unspecified outside sources, or both. 
 But nervous Republican members of Congress want to send all Social Security recipients a letter (at government expense, of course) assuring them that their benefits will never be cut. And now that the magic budget surplus has turned back into a pumpkin, the government is in no position to infuse new money into Social Security -- on the contrary, the government at large is now borrowing from Social Security at a furious pace. 
 So why is the Bush administration reviving its push for private accounts right now? Did it really learn nothing from the implosion of the reform commission? I doubt it; the administration's economists aren't fools, though loyalty often requires that they pretend otherwise.
 A more likely interpretation is that this is entirely cynical. War frenzy is subsiding, the Bush domestic agenda is stalled, and early indications for the November election aren't as good as Karl Rove expected. So it's fantasy time: tantalize the public with visions of sugarplums, then blame Democrats for snatching the goodies away. And it doesn't matter that the numbers don't add up, because the plan will never be tested by reality.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Seeks to Revive Line With Convertible PT Cruiser 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 4 

 BODY:
Chrysler said today that it planned to make a convertible version of the PT Cruiser, which was an instant hit when it reached the auto market two years ago but whose luster has since begun to fade.
 The announcement came at the Geneva International Motor Show, traditionally the place where European manufacturers spotlight their most attractive new vehicles. Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, said the PT convertible would go on sale sometime in 2004 as a two-door, four-seater vehicle. It will be built at the factory in Toluca, Mexico, where Chrysler builds the PT Cruiser. 
 The retro-looking vehicle, with its long sloping nose, distinctive grill and high back end, went on sale in April 2000 to wild customer enthusiasm. Meant to evoke a 1930's Ford roadster, the PT led to long waiting lists at showrooms and some dealers added premiums of up to $5,000 on the vehicle, which had a sticker price starting at about $16,000. Fervent customers scoured Internet sites in search of PT's and traveled hundreds of miles to pick up cars. 
Though marginally profitable -- Chrysler reportedly earns only about $800 on each vehicle -- the PT provided one of Chrysler's few bright spots during a financial crisis later that year that led to the ouster of the management team.
Chrysler sold about 150,000 PT's in the United States last year, its first full year of sales, and 30,000 more worldwide. It contended that it had enough orders to fill production for two years. But by last summer, the lines of customers had diminished and PT's became easy to find. 
While PT sales spiked in October thanks to interest-free financing started by the automakers in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, they fell in January to their lowest level since the introduction of the PT, according to Autodata Inc. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
That prompted Chrysler to offer a $1,000 cash rebate on the PT, its first for the vehicle. The incentives helped return February sales to the levels seen in the best days of the PT.
Chrysler's decision to build the PT convertible comes just shy of a year since it showed a concept version at the New York Auto Show. While applauding the decision to bring out the convertible, some analysts questioned whether Chrysler had waited too long. 
"It would have been nice to have it within 18 months of the original," said Ron Pinelli, an analyst with Autodata. 
Indeed, Chrysler has shown some reluctance to act quickly when it comes to the PT. In the fall of 2000, when the PT was at its peak of popularity, executives were pondering whether to expand production when Chrysler was broadsided by its financial crisis. It took until last April for Chrysler to announce that it would expand PT production by 80,000 vehicles a year at the Toluca factory. That move will push PT to an eventual production goal of about 300,000 a year.
However, Steven Girsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said Chrysler would benefit from any new vehicle that could bring it some attention. "I don't think it will be too late, because the PT is so interesting," Mr. Girsky said.
Mr. Pinelli added: "I think the PT has legs. It's a vehicle that looks cool, they're affordable and they're functional."
The PT will not be the only convertible in Chrysler's lineup. It also sells the Sebring, which was restyled for the 2001 model year. And the PT will have to compete with at least two dozen other convertibles on the market, including a version of the Volkswagen Beetle that is expected to go on sale sometime in 2003 and could give the PT a strong run for automotive buzz.

On Mean Streets, a U.S. Import: Zero Tolerance

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras 

 BODY:
The police station near the top of the steep hill looked ready for battle, as soldiers in camouflage carrying assault rifles stood guard behind sandbags. Yet everywhere else in the San Francisco neighborhood, people strolled calmly while children played in the dusty streets.
 After years of gang fights, kidnappings, robberies and assaults, the Honduran government finally declared a nationwide "war against crime" in late January. Now thousands of soldiers and police officers patrol violent neighborhoods and crowded commercial strips. 
 Numerous people, especially young men in long hair, baggy pants and gang tattoos, have been stopped and frisked. At checkpoints in busy intersections, troops stop cars with tinted windows and buses for quick inspections. In some cases, the police order all male passengers off buses and search them.
In the weeks since the start of the blitz, which focuses on everything from disorderly conduct to homicide, killings and robberies have dropped drastically and no kidnappings have been reported.
"It's a big difference, and a good one," said Leocadio Valladares, an 80-year-old fruit vendor who has been robbed. "Before, you would go out at night and get assaulted. By 9 at night, only the brave would go out, with a patron saint to protect them."
The zero-tolerance campaign here is an especially aggressive response to a widespread problem in Central America. Peace accords ended decades of military rule and civil war in the region, only to open the way to an alarming increase in common crime. 
Even President Ricardo Maduro has suffered. His only son was killed in a botched kidnapping attempt in 1997. He still pins a tiny black ribbon on his shirt as a sign of mourning. His campaign last year centered on a promise to improve security, and his slogan is still plastered on walls everywhere: futuro seguro con Maduro, a safe future with Maduro. 
He drew inspiration for his anticrime strategy from a visit to New York City late last year. He met with police officials to learn about their zero-tolerance approach, in which the police went after small crimes as vigorously as big ones.
The military and police mobilization he authorized reflected his view, increasingly accepted among the region's leaders, that violence and insecurity are the greatest threats to peacetime prosperity.
"Crime is the primary obstacle to development in Latin America," Mr. Maduro said in an interview. "The citizen who feels the government cannot defend him is a citizen who feels society cannot solve basic problems. It creates unemployment, since factory owners who have left the country mention security more than business costs as the reason for leaving. Without security there is no governability." 
Before the crackdown, most Hondurans in this capital city had no option but to walk home quickly after work and shut themselves inside. In the mid-1990's big youth gangs, modeled after gangs in El Salvador, began swaggering though poor neighborhoods and commercial centers alike, growing to almost 40,000 members who robbed pedestrians and shook down bus drivers. In some areas, the police were not only outnumbered, but also outgunned.
"People were going crazy, and police officers died," said Superintendent Javier Flores Milla, a police spokesman. "A patrol would pass though a business district to investigate a report and soon there would be three officers facing 50 gang members. The police no longer wanted to go out, saying why would they want to go into the wolf's mouth to die."
Now the police have reclaimed the streets with the support of soldiers, who join them on everything from rush-hour security cordons around busy bus stops to efforts to catch offenders in the act. 
While commanders insisted that they were not profiling youths on the basis of clothing alone, the police on the street admitted that they routinely went after groups of loitering teenagers.
"What we do is a stop-and-search," said Inspector Lorenzo Lara Munoz. "After that, we take our leave and say, the next time we pass, we do not want to see you here." 
Human rights advocates have criticized the campaign, contending that teenagers are police targets and that excessive force is used. The sight of the military patrolling the streets also has alarming implications for people who remember past abuses. 
"This could lead to increasing the power of the military in government, as if to say we civilians cannot assure order in the country, " said Leo Valladares, the national commissioner for human rights. Mr. Maduro has assured critics that the military deployment is only a stopgap. 
Since the operations have begun, gang members in many neighborhoods have gone into hiding, residents said. Some are even trying to have their tattoos removed. 
Out in the streets there has been a ground swell of support for the campaign. So Mr. Maduro is scrambling to find money to keep it going. 
Skeptical officials said the campaign would not ultimately succeed unless the government had a broader policy to combat the causes of crime. 
"You can't talk about reducing violence unless you think about what policies we have to generate employment and education, and right now we have no definitive policy" said Miguel Pastor, the mayor of Tegucigalpa. 
Edwin Jose Palma Baraona, a gang member who tattooed the number 18 on his forehead out of allegiance to the group named Mara 18, also had his doubts that the campaign would achieve permanent results. He said he and his friends were only biding their time.
"There are too many of us to get us all off the street," he said smugly.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Rally Amid Signs That Recovery Is Accelerating

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied powerfully yesterday for the second consecutive session amid signs that the economy is recovering more quickly and strongly than investors had expected.
 Last fall, with the economy apparently in shock after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many forecasters thought the United States might remain in recession for most of 2002. Now, economic growth appears to be accelerating, and investors are snapping up stocks in the belief that corporate profits will soon follow. At least for the moment, the economy's recovery has overwhelmed concerns about corporate accounting as well as worries that stocks remain expensive by many historical benchmarks. 
 "A weak economy is healing pretty rapidly," said Steven Wieting, senior economist at Salomon Smith Barney. Mr. Wieting now predicts that the economy will grow at an annualized rate of more than 4 percent in the first quarter. A few months ago, he was expecting 1 percent growth for the quarter.
The rally yesterday was broad and deep, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 217.96 points, or 2.1 percent, to 10,586.82, its highest level in almost seven months. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.06 points, or 2 percent, to 1,153.84, while the Nasdaq composite index, which is driven mainly by technology stocks, soared 56.58 points, or 3.1 percent, to 1,859.32.
A mix of factors is driving the economic recovery, analysts said. Thanks to rebates and low-interest loans from automakers, consumers are still buying cars. With long-term interest rates low, the housing sector has also held up well. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates to their lowest level in 40 years, cutting borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
At the same time, energy prices are near historic lows. The price of natural gas has fallen almost 75 percent since the end of 2000, and oil and electricity prices have also dropped. Lower energy prices leave consumers with more money to spend on other goods.
All this has helped to prop up consumer demand, and retailers like Wal-Mart Stores are reporting solid sales gains. Now, manufacturers, which cut production last year to slim their bloated inventories, are increasing production to meet demand. 
"Having been dragged down by Enron-itis and accounting and accounting-related concerns, and the potential for overstatement of corporate profits, we're now focusing on the main event, which is the recovery in manufacturing and in G.D.P. and in profits," said Jeff Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. 
Old-line manufacturing companies were among the biggest winners yesterday. General Motors jumped $3.73, or 6.8 percent, to $58.70, and Dow Chemical rose $1.20, or 3.7 percent, to $33.40. Media companies, which are also viewed as economically sensitive and likely to gain in a recovery, also rose. Viacom added $1.66, or 3.5 percent, to $49.45, while Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio operator, rose $1.95, or 4.1 percent, to $49.55.
Investors also seemed to put aside concerns about accounting practices. Yesterday's big gainers included several companies that have been dogged by questions about their financial reporting. The most prominent was Tyco International, a Bermuda-based manufacturing conglomerate that jumped $2.84, or 9.4 percent, to $33.14.
"Suddenly, people are waking up to a lot of the positive economic news that's been going on for a long time," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, which manages $1.4 billion. Ms. Clayman said she expected the gains to continue and was buying industrial stocks.
"The real economy is going to show some strong growth this year, and industrial concerns and basic materials should do well as a result," she said.
But the rally was not confined to the manufacturing sector. Technology stocks also posted sharp gains despite a profit warning on Friday afternoon from Oracle, the second-largest software manufacturer. Although Oracle skidded $2.32, or 14.5 percent, to $13.67, other well-known technology companies, including Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and Dell Computer, advanced strongly.
Those gains perplexed Ms. Clayman, who said she did not see much evidence that demand for technology products was recovering. In addition, although Cisco and other big technology companies have dropped 50 percent to 90 percent from their highs two years ago, they remain very expensive relative to their earnings, she said.
"A lot of people have a lot more technology equipment than they ever thought possible," she said.
Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist of National City Bank in Cleveland, said the market's short-term gains were not surprising, considering the strength the economy had shown recently. But in the long run, investors should be concerned that the price-earnings ratio of both technology and nontechnology stocks are high compared with historical averages, he said.
"There's no doubt that's been a turn for the better over the last three months," he said. But "we're starting with really very lofty equity valuations." --------------------

Most Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News)
 Bond prices mostly fell yesterday on expectations that the economy had recovered from recession, adding to speculation the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates soon.
Traders pushed the benchmark 10-year note yields above 5 percent at one point during the session for the first time since the middle of February after economists at Merrill Lynch and HSBC Securities said stronger-than-expected retail sales and business investment would increase first-quarter growth. Bruce Steinberg at Merrill increased his forecast to 3.5 percent from 2 percent, and HSBC's Ian Morris raised his to 4 percent from negative 0.5 percent.
By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 4/32, to a price of 99 2/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 5.00 percent from 4.98 percent on Friday.
The two-year note fell slightly. But the 30-year bond rose 4/32, to a price of 98 10/32. Its yield fell to 5.49 percent from 5.50 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves to Close Canadian Drug Route for Illegal Stimulant 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 4 

 BODY:
The illegal production in the United States of popular stimulants like methamphetamine reflects lax regulations in Canada for the chemical ingredients, American and Canadian law enforcement officials have said.
 As a result, Canada has become the leading supply route for the raw ingredient -- typically in the form of decongestants -- to the United States where the substances are more tightly controlled. 
 In the last 11 months, the United States Customs Service has seized more than 110 million tablets of decongestants that contain the primary ingredient for making methamphetamines, or "speed," as smugglers tried to bring them across the border among shipments of everything from furniture to glassware.
The seizures have become so huge that Robert C. Bonner, the commissioner of the United States Customs Service, recently joked that enough decongestant had been confiscated from one truck "to unplug about every nose in Michigan for several years." 
That truck had crossed the Ambassador Bridge into Detroit last year from Canada where the decongestant, pseudoephedrine, is perfectly legal and freely obtained even though it is a tightly controlled substance in the United States.
Canada's connection to illegal American methamphetamine production arose after Washington tightened controls over pseudoephedrine several years ago, and as trafficking routes through Mexico were shut down. Now, an alliance of diverse organized crime groups stretching from Mexico to Iraq and Jordan have found Canada an easy entry point into a growing American market for synthetic drugs.
Canadian businesses legitimately import the chemical substance in powder form, mostly from China. The Canadian government concedes that they have relatively loose control on the power which criminal elements have easily circumvented. 
Those imports have increased 14 times since 1995, United States and Canadian law enforcement officials said. Some of that has helped Canadian cold sufferers in the form of decongestants manufactured by several Canadian pharmaceutical companies.
But a large portion of it has entered the American black market for methamphetamine, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and Canadian officials said.
"The diversion of pseudoephedrine from Canadian suppliers to the illicit market is reaching a critical level," according to an intelligence report by the Drug Enforcement Administration and Royal Canadian Mounted Police in January.
As methamphetamine, which gives users a seductive rush of power, confidence and energy, has grown in popularity since the mid-1990's, it has become a priority for law enforcement officials. 
The drug is an especially addictive narcotic that can cause brain damage and aggressive behavior and has been linked to 60,000 admissions a year in American hospitals.
Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration officials have tracked the profit trail of pseudoephedrine smuggling to the Middle East, where they are probing to see if the money is being used to finance terrorist networks.
Illicit methamphetamine use is minimal in Canada, and little processing is believed to be done here. But under prodding from the Bush administration, Canada has acknowledged the trafficking problem and the government here is drafting a number of regulations on pseudoephedrine imports and exports as well as enforcement strategies to close the Canadian connection.
The parliamentary review process in Canada can be slow, however, and Canadian officials say that full enactment and enforcement of new regulations cannot come any sooner than December.
While United States officials are quick to credit the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian customs officials for helping American investigators trace the supply route, senior Bush administration officials and American lawmakers are pressing Canada for more action.
"In Canada, there is just no regulation," for pseudoephedrine, said Asa Hutchinson, the Drug Enforcement Administration chief. "Hopefully that will be remedied very quickly."
Canadian officials say they want to help shut down the pipeline as quickly as possible.
"We are aware of the problem," said Andrew Swift, a spokesman for Health Canada, the agency drafting the controls which will construct a paper trail to aid narcotics investigations. "And the regulations will address the problem."
Since September 11, as border security has been tightened, traffickers have become more cagey, concealing the chemical shipments in legitimate shipments of products like bubble gum and in vehicles disguised as Federal Express or United States Postal Service trucks.
The extent of the pseudoephedrine problem was revealed by a recent Drug Enforcement Administration and American customs enforcement operation called Operation Mountain Express III that resulted in 371 arrests, more than 16 tons of pseudoephedrine seized and more than $17 million in cash confiscated. A majority of the traffickers arrested in the operation, which included Canadian law enforcement assistance, were of Jordanian and Iraqi origin and had resident status in the United States.
Drug enforcement agents found that traffickers using assumed names bought the chemicals in Canada and brought them across the border to Port Huron, Mich., and Detroit, making that city and Chicago hubs for distribution. 
Various traffickers then took the chemicals to clandestine laboratories, mostly run by Mexican organized crime in California, to be processed into methamphetamine.
American law enforcement officials in January characterized the operation as a big success. But Paul Marsh, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said the networks were running again.
"There has been no noticeable difference," he said. "We need regulations in place that would make it more difficult for persons with criminal intent to purchase these chemicals in the first place." 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 9, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about an effort by the United States to close a Canadian drug route for illegal stimulants referred imprecisely to the availability of the decongestant pseudoephedrine. Although it is tightly controlled in the United States when bought and sold in large quantities, it is widely available in retail sales as a component of over-the-counter medicines like Sudafed. The article also classified the drug methamphetamine incorrectly. It is a stimulant, not a narcotic.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CHARITY; 
Response to Relief Effort Exceeds Expectations

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
As the six-month mark approaches after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, executives at the charities supported by the 9/11 Neediest Fund reflected on the wave of need that found its way to their doorsteps and on the flood of donations that met it.
 In the days after the attack, officials at The New York Times Company Foundation approached the seven charities that are supported by the foundation's annual antipoverty campaign, and asked if they would be willing to extend their services to victims of Sept. 11 and their families. All seven gave an enthusiastic yes. The foundation also approached three agencies that help the families of police officers and firefighters, bringing to 10 the number of charities charged with providing emergency relief. 
 "All the machinery was in place," said Jack Rosenthal, president of the Times Company Foundation, which administers both funds. "By using the framework of the annual Neediest Cases Fund, we were able to launch this special drive the next day."
On Sept. 12, the foundation kicked off the new fund and estimated that readers would contribute $4 million to $5 million in total -- but the fund received that much in just the first week. As of yesterday, the fund has raised nearly $60 million.
Initially, as donations flooded in, requests for help did not. "In the immediate aftermath, many people were in such a state of shock it took a while for them to come forward with their needs," said Msgr. Kevin Sullivan, chief operating officer of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, which has been allocated $3.5 million from the fund.
But within weeks, the requests for aid began to pour in, and the agencies began hiring additional staff members to handle all the phone calls, many from people asking for help for the first time in their lives.
Most agencies reported that the pace of requests reached its highest level from November to January and that the number of people asking for help had not declined much since. "Requests for assistance from the Brooklyn Bureau reached their peak in early November and remain high," said a report from Norma H. Martin, assistant executive director of the Brooklyn Bureau, which has given $4.4 million to attack victims and their families. 
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, which has spent $3 million for Sept. 11 emergency relief, noted that those whose six months of unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire soon were starting to ask for help, and might constitute a new wave of requests.
In January, the Protestant federation began referring callers to a voice message stating that money for disaster relief had run out.
People who were given grants from the fund largely asked for help with basic day-to-day living expenses, agencies said. Ms. Martin's report indicated that 59 percent of those requesting assistance from the Brooklyn Bureau needed help with rent or mortgage payments, 20 percent with food and transportation, 11 percent with utilities and 10 percent with other expenses, including credit card payments. 
The report said 42 percent of those seeking help worked in the travel, tourism or restaurant business, 29 percent worked for livery, delivery or taxi services, and 29 percent worked in or near the trade center.
Today, the Times Company Foundation is issuing a report about the 9/11 Neediest Fund on its Web site, nytco.com/company/foundation /neediest/index.html. 
Officials at the foundation and the charities emphasized yesterday that disbursements were made quickly. Mr. Rosenthal said 98 percent of the amount donated to the 9/11 Neediest Fund has been spent or committed.
David R. Jones, chief executive of the Community Service Society of New York, which has given $3 million to people hurt financially by the attack, said he was pleased with the speed at which money was made available.
"The fact that we got the money out so quickly," he said, "was one of the singular successes of all of this."

HEADLINE: Mining Gold in Laos Where Bombs Once Rained 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SEPON BASE CAMP, Laos 

 BODY:
The earth here is suffused with metal millions of ounces of gold, millions of tons of copper and thousands of pounds of very old, very live American bombs left over from the Vietnam War.
 "You factor it into everything you do," said Michael Wilkes, project manager for Oxiana Resources, a small Australian company that is developing a mine here. "Before you go anywhere, you have to have it cleared." 
 Long before miners ever heard of the Sepon camp, American pilots knew the area as the head of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and a transit point for troops and supplies heading from North Vietnam through Laos and Cambodia to South Vietnam. In a vain effort to stem that flow in the late 1960's and early 70's, United States forces subjected Laos to the heaviest aerial bombardment in history. More American bombs were dropped on this stretch of territory than on Vietnam or on Europe in World War II. 
Now, Oxiana is helping to turn this bomb-riddled patch of jungle into part of Laos's first special economic zone. Oxiana's project, about 250 miles southeast of the capital, Vientiane, is the first significant foreign mining investment in Laos. When the mine is opened later this year, workers will begin to extract what the company projects is roughly $1 billion in gold and almost $2 billion in copper.
The Laotian government is counting on Oxiana's mine to provide desperately needed tax revenue and to help end a drought in foreign investment that has left Laos, an impoverished Communist backwater, more dependent than ever on aid. "Investments like Oxiana's could turn things in the opposite direction," said Paul V. Turner, the resident representative for the Asian Development Bank in Vientiane.
This country's more than five million people live in conditions more typical of Africa than Southeast Asia. Illiterate children survive on less than 90 cents a day in remote villages. Many venture to cities only to end up across the Mekong River, in Thailand, working in sweatshops or as prostitutes.
Laos wants to rise from the ranks of the world's poorest nations by 2020, something the International Monetary Fund estimates will require annual economic growth of at least 7 percent. Last year, the economy grew 5.5 percent. To reach 7 percent, Laos must create an economy that is more investor friendly, the I.M.F. and others say.
That may seem as if it would be anathema to Laos -- formally, the Lao People's Democratic Republic -- but the country's Communist leaders, since taking power in 1975, have not been particularly dogmatic. When collectivization failed a quarter-century ago, the government took a pragmatic approach and in 1986 approved a "new economic mechanism" aimed at creating a market-based economy.
In 1991, Laos adopted a Constitution enshrining private property and free enterprise. The hammer and sickle disappeared from the flag, and three years later Laos adopted one of Southeast Asia's most permissive foreign investment laws.
Investors flooded in, but the onset of the Asian financial crisis in mid-1997 put an end to the boom. In 1999, foreign investment in Laos fell to $51.5 million from $379.7 million in 1997.
To try to make up for that, the government began an expensive irrigation program, with the central bank alone putting up $24 million . Though it succeeded in making Laos self-sufficient in rice, the program sent the nation's debt spiraling. The inflation rate soared to more than 120 percent, and the Laotian currency, the kip, lost nearly 90 percent of its value.
Laos has since brought inflation back to single digits, but its banks remain burdened with many bad loans, depriving fledgling private business of cash.
To fill that gap, the government is courting foreign investors. The vice chairwoman of the State Planning and Cooperation Committee, Khempeng Pholsena, told an investment seminar in Singapore recently that foreign investors should come to Laos simply because it "offers very attractive conditions." She and other officials declined to be interviewed for this article.
Beyond hydroelectric power and other natural resources, Laos lacks just about everything. Its domestic market is small, and paved roads and electricity are rare. Worse for many investors, few officials speak English or understand business.
Red tape, though, is in ready supply. The government only recently lifted a rule requiring every foreign investment, no matter how small, to be approved by the prime minister. Still, government approvals typically take more than a year.
The authorities are candid about these problems and say they are trying to overcome them, whether by educating officials or issuing decrees eliminating bureaucratic obstacles.
It helps to have a local guide. For Oxiana, that is Saman Aneka, who grew up not far from Sepon. Now 47, he remembers as a teenager watching American bombers drop their payloads. Mr. Saman studied geology in the Soviet Union and after a brief stint in government joined an Australian mining company, CRA, to explore Sepon in 1990.
People who live near Sepon have long known the area as Muang Ang Kham, the district of the gold valleys. In the early 80's, Soviet geologists found Laotians panning for gold with chunks of shrapnel and aircraft wreckage.
CRA saw potential in the area, but winning a deal with the government on taxes and mining rights took more than two years of negotiations, said Robert Maloney, an Australian lawyer who worked for CRA in Laos at the time. Laos had no mining law and officials had little concept of the industry. "A lot of it was basically education to explain what risk and reward was," Mr. Maloney said. And there were numbers of visiting investors, not all of them reliable.
It helped that CRA was not the only mining company working with the Laotians. Newmont Mining was also negotiating a contract to explore for gold in the northern part of Laos, and in 1993 it clinched a deal. Just weeks later, CRA won a contract giving it the exclusive right to explore a 1,930-square-mile area around Sepon.
But when CRA's surveyors arrived, they were slowed by malaria and other diseases, said Antony Manini, who came to Sepon for CRA and also now works for Oxiana. To avoid the unexploded bombs, they carried metal detectors everywhere they walked.
The bombs also yielded some happy surprises. While surveying one day in 1995, Mr. Saman and two other geologists stumbled on evidence of gold in rock formations that war created. What he and his colleagues jokingly called "bomb crater geology" turned out to be one of Sepon's biggest gold finds.
While Newmont eventually pulled out of Laos after finding only small quantities of gold, Oxiana estimates it is sitting on top of 3.5 million ounces -- at the current commodity price of gold worth more than $1 billion.
Yet it is the copper that excites Mr. Wilkes most. "It's super-high-grade," he said. Rio Tinto, the company formed when CRA merged with RTZ of Britain in 1995, discovered copper in 1998.
Rich as Sepon was, Rio Tinto decided that it too small to bother with. But Owen L. Hegarty, a former Rio Tinto executive who had left that company to help start Oxiana, saw opportunity. In 2000, Mr. Hegarty won a deal for Oxiana to pay Rio Tinto the roughly $22 million it had spent on developing the site in return for an 80 percent interest in the project.
The International Finance Corporation, a private investment arm of the World Bank, has already agreed to lend Oxiana $30 million of the $46 million the company estimates it will cost to build its gold mine. Oxiana then plans to use its profit from the gold to develop a $100 million copper mine.
Officials in Vientiane say the mine is likely to encourage other development projects in the area. The mine needs power, so there are plans to build a hydroelectric dam nearby. Copper will be trucked out, and construction is already under way on a two-lane highway across Laos from Thailand to Vietnam.
As incentives, Laos has exempted Oxiana from corporate taxes for two years as well as its employees from having to pay income taxes. It has waived duties on imported equipment and is permitting Oxiana to hire a customs official to be posted on site, eliminating long waits for shipments at the border. In return, Laos is to receive a 2.5 percent royalty on the value of the ore mined, taxes on Oxiana's profits after the two-year exempt period, and an option to buy a 10 percent interest in the mine.
Oxiana is also to have government help in eliminating unexploded ordnance, a scourge that kills at least 100 Laotians a year. It is a painstaking process. Crews use powerful metal detectors to search for objects as far as 10 feet below the ground. So far, they have found about 2,000 explosive devices -- from 1,000-pound bombs to fist-size antipersonnel weapons.
Oxiana prefers not to dwell on the unexploded weapons. "It sends the wrong message," Mr. Wilkes said, adding, "It doesn't make the project any riskier or less economical." In the 10 years that miners have been exploring the area, he declared, none have been hurt by a bomb.

Global Crossing Creditors Resist Asian Buyout Offer
Global Crossing's creditors are strongly resisting an offer by two Asian companies to acquire the company's assets after reports of a competing bid surfaced over the weekend, people close to the company said.
 The creditors, which have a large degree of influence over Global Crossing's future after it filed for bankruptcy protection, have told the Asian companies, Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies Telemedia, that the terms of their $750 million offer to acquire the company were unacceptable, these people said.

Northrop's TRW Bid Faces Hurdles
If Northrop Grumman is to succeed in its hostile $5.9 billion bid to take over TRW, analysts said, it will have to be on friendly terms. Investors are already expecting a sweetened offer from Northrop or, better still, a bidding war. And Northrop must overcome tough antitakeover laws in Ohio, where TRW is based. Investors punished Northrop, sending its shares down $4.25, to $103.50. Under the terms of Northrop's bid, its offer would be withdrawn should its shares fall below $103 or rise above $113.

PERSON: Nick Davis 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
He Has the Third-Generation Genes for His Genres

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
THE door to the Greenwich Village cubbyhole that houses Nick Davis Productions swings open to reveal the young company's namesake, Mr. Davis, outnumbered by flickering computer screens as he yaps into his phone in the hyper shorthand that passes for conversation with television types. He seems thrilled to be harried. Nothing like a production deadline to make a start-up producer's heart go pitter-patter. 
 "Yeah, ugh, whatever," he grunts before hanging up and tearing into the half-eaten banana that is subbing for lunch, which he missed because he was locked in the editing room putting some technical finishing touches on his new documentary, "New York at the Movies." 
 Son of the documentary filmmaker Peter Davis ("Hearts and Minds") and grandson of the Hollywood script-sculptor Herman Mankiewicz ("Citizen Kane"), Mr. Davis has the genes for his genre. Correction: genres. Not one for limits, he has been a producer, writer, director and, when granted an opening, a bit of a ham actor. 
He doesn't review his life, he performs it, including his re-enactment of a recent doctor visit -- he claims his doc blackmailed him into exercise by threatening a cholesterol-induced heart attack at 36. Hence the bananas and Clif bars, his "latest affectation." 
The charades are a hangover from his improvisational comedy era. He still keeps "the first and last dollar" he earned as a performer neatly folded in his dog-eared wallet, a silent reminder of why he switched careers. Producers get paid. 
His "New York at the Movies" received extra heft when Meryl Streep signed on as host. How much heft? Mr. Davis, who wrote and produced the two-hour special, wasn't even offended when Ms. Streep, in the throes of Sept. 11th emotionalism, wrote her own closing remarks. The spotlight's all hers; Mr. Davis, courtesy of his "highfalutin" Harvard education, is no dummy. He says he's outgrown that side of himself.
An ode to New York City as the world's most versatile film set, and a reminder to penny-pinching Hollywood moguls that faking Big Apple locales is rotten business, especially now as the city strives to repair the ravages of terrorism, the documentary will be shown on the A&E cable network March 17 and has a preview and panel discussion Thursday at New York University. 
Mr. Davis, a rapt New Yorker and acolyte of city-centric films and actors -- Al Pacino's star turn from "Dog Day Afternoon" is frozen on the computer screen behind him -- admits his documentary is a bit of "a valentine to New York, but not a Hallmark valentine."
"You can't fake New York, that is the subliminal message. 
"I completely understand why Hollywood tries to pretend it's shooting here when it isn't: economics. But audiences aren't stupid. The producers may save $20 million by shooting a New York film in Toronto, but in the end they're going to lose $40 million at the box office, because the movie takes a quality hit. There," he concludes, "how's that for spin? Except it's true."
A partly reformed smart-aleck, he did his fumbling and stumbling in his 20's: was the co-author of a novel, "Boone" (Anchor/Doubleday), but succumbed to writer's block on his solo encore; wrote, directed, and produced an independent movie, "1999," but only after wasting time and energy on an unmarketable indie; tried to make a go of improv but wound up despising the clown within. 
"All clowns are sad," he says, but he was a sadder case than most. He felt guilty living off something he called "Mom's money," an insurance settlement from his mother's accidental death. Johanna Mankiewicz, a novelist, was struck and killed by a taxi in their Greenwich Village neighborhood when Mr. Davis was 9. He received a small windfall, enough to support him through several years of vocational dabbling, when he turned 21. 
"I cried the night she died, and then I soldiered on. The word 'repression' comes to mind. In my 20's, it all kind of hit me. I was on a treadmill to nowhere."
IN 1991, Mr. Davis hit his fork in the entertainment road: tether himself to the truth and pursue documentary work at the entry level with a master like Ken Burns (not that Mr. Burns, then developing "Baseball" and "The West" for PBS, had offered a job), or write quips for Comedy Central? He chose Mr. Burns. "I clawed my way into an internship and realized pretty quickly that he had the job I wanted."
After two years with Mr. Burns, he left to work on a double project with his father. He wrote and directed "Jack: The Last Kennedy Film" for CBS, winner of an editing Emmy and nominated for a Writer's Guild Award, and was a co-producer of 21 short films for the Kennedy Library in Boston. Next he wrote "Money and Power: The History of Business," for David Grubin Productions, his eye on Mr. Grubin as it had been on Mr. Burns. Two years ago he opened Nick Davis Productions and was hired by Bravo to produce a profile of Gene Wilder.
Mr. Davis lives on the Upper West Side with his wife, the novelist Jane Mendelsohn, and their daughter, Lily, and isn't sure "which ship will come in next." But he has narrowed his focus: "Producing is where the buck stops. It's the position of ultimate accountability. My grandfather was my hero growing up; he was a great writer, but he drank himself to death. And he was miserably self-hating. He was not someone to emulate."
Though he wouldn't turn down the chance to produce a documentary about him.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: BORDER SECURITY; 
Tinderbox of a Texas Port Points to a Threat by Sea

BYLINE:  By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: PORT ARTHUR, Tex., March 2 

 BODY:
Few seaports in the nation seem as vulnerable as this one. 
 It is home to more than a dozen oil refineries and related plants, each with its own pier, that process noxious, volatile chemicals. In addition, more than 200 pipelines carrying fuel and other hazardous chemicals snake under Port Arthur in every direction. 
 All of it makes this place a tinderbox. 
Immediately after Sept. 11, local governments, federal agencies and industries strengthened security on the ground and at sea. Marc Blanton, the assistant chief of police, began noticing clusters of residents standing at the fences, staring at the huge refineries that define this small port town, whose motto used to be, "We oil the world."
"I think they were assessing the threat for themselves," Chief Blanton said.
Now, almost six months later, security is certainly more intense than it was in August. But a kind of complacency seems to have set in, even as senior officials in Washington begin to talk more urgently about the terrorist threat from the sea. 
Many of the off-duty Port Arthur police officers who were hired to patrol the refineries in the fall have been sent back to the station. The two additional Coast Guard boats sent here to patrol the harbor have left. 
Federal officials call port security the largest and most glaring weakness in the nation's security network. A presidential advisory commission concluded in August 2000 that "the state of security in U.S. seaports generally ranges from poor to fair, and in a few cases good."
In an interview on Thursday, Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the Intelligence Committee, called ports "a clear area of serious vulnerability." Senior Coast Guard officials in Washington now talk urgently about the potential for terrorists to use ships as weapons.
"Ships can be used to transport terrorists or weapons of mass destruction," Rear Adm. Terry Cross of the Coast Guard said in February. "They can be used as weapons, and they are going to try to blend in and look like regular traffic. We think it is important to publicly recognize how vulnerable seaports are."
When the refineries asked to hire the off-duty police officers last fall, "we didn't have enough people for all the requests," Chief Blanton said. Now, the refineries "have slowly backed off," he said. Many of the off-duty officers have been replaced by private unarmed security guards. 
Before the morning of Sept. 11 had ended, Capt. Eric A. Nicolaus, head of the Port Arthur Coast Guard Station, requested more personnel and more boats to protect the refineries and the public ports, even though port security had been a low priority for the Coast Guard before then. 
"We got two extra patrol boats," raising the total to five, Captain Nicolaus said, "and we brought in about 100 reservists." 
With the extra resources, the Coast Guard began searching many ships before they docked, looking for unusual cargo or crewmen.
Now, Captain Nicolaus said his Coast Guard crews remain at a high level of alert, but the two extra patrol boats have been sent back to their regular ports. The number of ships searched has declined, but he noted that local port pilots board each inbound ship to guide it in and would most likely notice anything amiss.
In the fall, representatives of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the area began meeting every week to discuss security issues. Recently the meetings were cut back to every two weeks.
Three major oil refineries lie within the city's jurisdiction, and more than a dozen others line the Sabine-Neches shipping channel that flows from Beaumont, slightly less than 20 miles upstream. Some of these refineries are among the nation's largest.
Crude oil and other volatile liquids flow into the plants by ship, five tankers a day, on average, and by pipeline from Mexico and other points south.
Refined products -- gasoline, diesel fuel, butane, ethylene, benzene, propane, kerosene, jet fuel and other noxious liquids -- pour out, tens of thousands of gallons a day, by truck and by train but mostly by pipeline.
"We had 216 of them at last count," Leslie E. McMahon, Port Arthur's director of public works, said of the pipelines. 
While all here acknowledge that a port with fixtures as explosive as this one has could be a target, many now seem little concerned.
"It's almost back to normal here," said Ronnie Hicks, technical supervisor for the Port of Port Arthur. 
But in Washington, Senator Graham has taken on port security as a major concern, saying, "Any smart terrorist would have to think of this," since ports offer "the lowest risk of detection and the highest chance of success."
Security officials in speeches and interviews describe three possible ways terrorists might use ships.
One, terrorists could sink a ship in a narrow shipping lane, like the Sabine-Neches channel, closing it for days or weeks. 
"It would be hard to get a ship like that up, no doubt," said John J. Durkay, general counsel for the refineries' Plant Managers' Association.
In Washington, Admiral Cross, speaking at a Defense Week seminar, said, "We think shutting down one or two major ports would do more damage to our economy than Sept. 11."
Two, terrorists might blow up a ship in an important port.
Or three, terrorists could hide an explosive weapon in one of the 600,000 cargo containers that arrive at American ports each day; fewer than 3 percent are opened and inspected. 
Robert C. Bonner, commissioner of the United States Customs Service, often talks about this concern, which he calls "a nuke in a box."
"One of the most lethal terrorist scenarios is the use of oceangoing container traffic as a means to smuggle terrorists and weapons of mass destruction into the United States," Mr. Bonner said. "And it is by no means far-fetched."
Shortly after Sept. 11, the Coast Guard issued a new rule: cargo ships approaching the United States would have to relay detailed crew lists to the Coast Guard 96 hours before reaching this country. Before, they had to report 24 hours in advance.
The agency set up the National Vessel Movement Center, in Martinsburg, W. Va., whose mission is to check those names against national criminal and terrorist databases.
After a few weeks, a federal official said, many shippers began moving seamen with Middle Eastern names onto ships not bound for the United States.
In Port Arthur, the refineries quickly put up fences, installed lighting and barriers and hired the off-duty officers to patrol their grounds around the clock.
The physical security measures remain in place. The way Mr. Durkay sees it: "After Sept. 11, a lot of the things this community had been preparing for were tested and found to be sound."

HEADLINE: Unusual Route to Diplomacy; 
Columbia Trains Standouts From a Community College

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The students sitting around the small seminar table at Hostos Community College last Friday were pleased to be part of an unusual experiment to send nontraditional and minority students into American foreign-policy careers by way of the Ivy League. 
 But the students were agitated as they listened to Mercedes Moscat, a counselor at Hostos, who told them that if they were going to succeed, they needed to cut out everything that got in the way: student activities, social life, even family. 
 "If you think Hostos is hard," she said, "imagine what it will be like when you go to Columbia." 
The session was one in a series of workshops to ease the transition from Hostos to Columbia University and then to international jobs. But for some of the students -- a handpicked group of motivated achievers -- the order to prioritize stymied them. Already, every moment of their lives was accounted for. 
"There are five of us taking six to eight classes, working and being parents," said Carolyn Castro, a single mother with two sons under the age of 6, who said she starts her homework at 8:30 p.m. -- after she reads to her children at bedtime -- and does not finish until almost 2 a.m. 
"I cannot let go," she said, as others nodded knowingly. "I cannot quit my job. I cannot let go of my family. And I cannot stop being a student. People kid me that since I'm in this program, I'd better take pictures of my kids, because I won't see them."
These stressed students will be given a shot to break into diplomacy, which has long recruited sophisticated polished students from the best schools, many of them white and upper class. But with the help of $2.3 million in government grants last year, Jose E. Serrano, the Bronx congressman, is determined to change this. Standout students from Hostos, a community college in his South Bronx district, will be channeled into Columbia in Upper Manhattan, one of the universities that have traditionally served as pipelines to America's diplomatic corps and other international careers. Congressman Serrano said he hoped that many would enter the Foreign Service and bring their own sensibilities to it.
Eligible Hostos graduates, known as Serrano scholars, will transfer to Columbia to earn their bachelor's degrees at Columbia's School of General Studies and then master's degrees at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs. Their tuition will be paid and they will also be given living stipends: $500 a semester while at Hostos, and $1,450 a month while at Columbia.
To qualify, students must be American citizens, maintain a 3.0 average and have a good command of English and one other language. Students have to apply separately for each step in the program; admission to each of the two Columbia programs is not automatic.
For many of the dozen students at Hostos, it is a leap. Columbia College generally takes some of the best students in the nation and throws them into a rigorous core curriculum where they must read hundreds of pages of classic literature and history a week and write extensive essays and research papers.
Many Hostos students, in contrast, start their studies with basic composition and math courses. The community college has been a magnet for high school dropouts, single mothers, impoverished immigrants and other untraditional students. Only 8 percent of its entering full-time students earn their associate's degree within three years. Five years ago, City University trustees and other critics charged that the college was allowing students to graduate without a firm command of English.
But Hostos officials, including Dolores M. Fernandez, its president, say that while Hostos undoubtedly has some weak students, it also has many strong ones -- like their nursing graduates, who often have some of the highest passing rates on certification exams in New York State, and like the 12 students they have chosen as their first Serrano Scholars.
There is Jeannette Berrios, a bubbly 24-year-old single mother in the program who scored above 1,400 on her SAT's but who lived in a homeless shelter with her 2-year-old son, Raymond, for more than a year after their apartment burned down. She graduated from Hostos last month with a 3.85 average.
And there is Luis Rivera, 22, who dropped out of his Brooklyn high school before graduation, enrolled at Hostos after he lost his job towing cars and now has a straight A average.
Ziograin Correa, 23, enrolled at Hostos after he was injured while working as a security guard. He is taking the most challenging courses he can find, including Shakespeare and pre-calculus, but has managed to make the dean's list and honor roll every semester. "My friends think I'm crazy," Mr. Correa said. "But I'm proud of myself. I've done what I wanted and a little more."
Hostos officials are confident they have more than enough students to make it at Columbia.
"All of these students have the intelligence and the ability," said Alice Blanch, the program's director. She says the workshops -- in everything from speaking and writing to interviewing techniques and self-esteem -- are aimed not at changing the students so much as "honing skills that are already there."
The program places students in Columbia's School of General Studies, which has about 1,200 students, about half of them part-time; the average age at General Studies is 28. Many General Studies students come from community colleges, so the school provides intensive advising and tutoring. General Studies students have some of their own core courses; otherwise they attend classes side by side with Columbia College students.
"This isn't new to us," said Peter J. Awn, dean of general studies, who noted that the school also runs another program for economically disadvantaged students. "The greatest challenge is really admissions, to say the potential is really here to measure up to the same demands that every other college student is asked to meet. We are on the mark 90 to 95 percent of the time." He said that the four Hostos graduates already in the Serrano program at Columbia were doing well. 
Luz Maria Lambert, a self-assured Dominican immigrant in her late 30's, is one of them; she graduated from Hostos in 1999 and was president of the student government there.
Ms. Lambert said she had found many differences between Hostos and Columbia. The Columbia student body, she said, is both more diversified -- two-thirds of Hostos students are of Hispanic descent -- and less of a community. Educationally, she said, Columbia courses are tougher and students are expected to be more self-sufficient. 
"At Hostos you were taken by the hand," she said. "At Columbia, if you need information, don't ask a teacher. They will say: 'That's a good question. Now go find the answer.' "
She said that professors sometimes make references that she misses. In one class, when a teacher referred to inductive and deductive reasoning, she hesitated to ask what it meant, because everyone else seemed to understand. She asked later.
For the most part, she jumps in. 
"It's a lot more demanding here," she said, "especially for a non-native English speaker. We are competing with the best students from top high schools. They have been trained for life and we really have to grow."

PERSON: Marvin E. Frankel 

HEADLINE: Marvin Frankel, Federal Judge and Pioneer of Sentencing Guidelines, Dies at 81 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Marvin E. Frankel, an outspoken litigator, judge and legal scholar whose views helped to establish sentencing guidelines for the federal courts, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81. 
 The cause was prostate cancer, his daughter Mara said. 
 In a career of more than 50 years Judge Frankel, a former member of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, made his mark as a widely traveled campaigner for human rights and as an advocate before the Supreme Court. He was instrumental in drafting the brief for The New York Times in the landmark First Amendment case, Times v. Sullivan, which set sharp limits on libel suits brought by public figures. His final appearance before the high court was last month. 
While on the bench, he wrote "Criminal Sentences, Law Without Order" with Gary Naftalis, a book that argued that judges seemed to mete out sentences with more caprice than rules. He once called federal sentencing "a nonsystem in which every judge is a law unto himself or herself and the sentence a defendant gets depends on the judge he or she gets."
The book provided the intellectual impetus for federal sentencing guidelines, which, despite their many detractors, sought to bring order to the highly subjective sentencing process. 
In all, he wrote five books and more than 40 major articles, and there, too, he did not pull punches. 
In 1973, when President Nixon accused judges of being soft-headed and called for harsher sentences, Judge Frankel wrote: "With all deference to the top Federal officer, his theories on reducing crime are open to serious question and his strictures against softness in judges are without basis in hard fact. His proposals for severity are neither new nor useful, but only invite us to official cruelties unlikely to accomplish anything beneficial."
Marvin Earle Frankel was born on July 26, 1920, in New York City. His father, Charles, was a salesman, and his mother, the former Anne Brody, was a beautician. He grew up in Newark and graduated at 16 from Weequahic High School, made famous by Philip Roth.
He set off into the world on his own and soon joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, working in Lake Placid's zero-degree cold in the winter and in Las Vegas's 100-degree heat in the summer.
He returned to the East Coast and began studying economics at Queens College. To pay for his schooling, he drove taxis and ice cream trucks and pushed clothes racks in the garment district of Manhattan.
With World War II raging, he joined the Army in 1942 -- his Queens College diploma did not arrive until the following year. A badly damaged knee forced him to leave Officers Training School, but he rose to staff sergeant and spent much of the war doing supply work in Accra in West Africa.
In 1945, he married Betty Streich. They were divorced in 1965, and that year he married the former Alice Kross, chief psychiatrist of child development of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. She survives him, as does a daughter from his first marriage, Eleanor Perlman, of East Northport, N.Y., a daughter from his second marriage, Mara Wallace, of Palo Alto, Calif.; two stepchildren, Ellen Schorr of New York and David K. Schorr of Washington; a sister, Marjorie Frankel, of New York City, and six grandchildren.
After the war he went to Columbia University to study political science, but he switched to the law school. He graduated in two years, in 1948, and was editor in chief of the law review.
The following year, he went to work for the Solicitor General's office in Washington, helping to write briefs and argue cases before the Supreme Court. He argued his first case before the high court in March 1952.
From 1956 to 1962, he was a partner in the New York law firm, Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn. He began teaching at Columbia University Law School in 1962 and it was there that he came to play a major role in the Times v. Sullivan decision, helping the constitutional scholar Herbert Wechsler write a brief that was presented to the Supreme Court.
In March 1960, with sit-ins and civil rights marches spreading across the South, The New York Times ran an advertisement seeking contributions for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders. The advertisement included several inaccuracies: it incorrectly said, for example, that a student dining hall had been padlocked to starve students into submission.
A jury found the ad libelous, but the Supreme Court, in a unanimous 1964 decision, overruled that decision, saying the press could not satisfy the need for vigorous debate of issues if it had to prove the accuracy of every statement about a public official. Public officials, the court wrote, could win damages only by showing a libelous statement had been made with knowledge that it was false, or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. 
With the backing of Robert F. Kennedy, he was nominated to the federal bench and took his place in New York's southern district in 1965. As a judge, he presided over a wide range of cases and was known for his penetrating but literary style in his decisions. 
He did not shrink from making controversial rulings. In 1973, he found that the Wood, Wire and Metal Lathers Union had discriminated against members of minority groups so he ordered the union to grant half its new positions to them.
In 1976, he gave a four-month prison sentence to Bernard Bergman, a rabbi who was the central figure in a New York City nursing scandal, a sentence that prosecutors attacked as lenient.
Judge Frankel surprised the legal community in 1978 by returning to private practice, at Proskauer Rose, until 1983. From that year until his death he worked as a partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a Manhattan law firm, where he was litigation director for many years.
After leaving the courtroom, he quickly transformed himself into a human rights crusader, becoming chairman of the board of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. He traveled to the Soviet Union and criticized repression of Jews, and to Israel, where he said living conditions for political prisoners were "quite terrible." He went to South Africa to criticize apartheid and to Argentina and Zaire to publicize kidnappings and murders by military regimes.
In 1988, when he went to Kenya to attend an inquest into the death of an opposition leader who had perished in police custody, he was arrested for two days.
"He was a model for people who believe that law should be used as a tool to protect human rights," said Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. "He embodied everything we stood for so we tried to use him as much as we could."
Twelve days ago, using in a wheelchair because of his cancer, he made a last argument before the Supreme Court, saying that the use of school vouchers in Cleveland was an improper entanglement of church and state. That argument came just days before the 50th anniversary of his first argument before the court.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: COMPENSATION; 
U.S. MAY APPROVE MORE AID FOR KIN OF SEPT. 11 DEAD

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
After months of criticism from the families of those killed on Sept. 11, the Bush administration is close to a decision on several changes in the Victims Compensation Fund that could result in scores of families' receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars more than the fund's original rules would have allowed.
 The new rules would also open the fund to hundreds of additional rescue workers and World Trade Center employees who were injured in the attack, including those who suffered disabling lung ailments. 
 Administration officials with knowledge of the discussions said several big changes were all but certain to be in the final rules. In the most significant financial adjustment, the amount to spouses and children for noneconomic damages like loss of companionship would go to $100,000 from $50,000.
Some officials in New York and New Jersey have also expressed cautious optimism that the $250,000 payments to cover the pain and suffering of those who died might also be increased, although the final rules do not yet include any such increase. 
The new rules would also reduce various deductions that have the potential of cutting awards by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Social Security death benefits for widows would not be deducted under the revised rules, nor would most workers' compensation benefits to surviving spouses, victim advocates have been told by White House officials.
The draft version of the rules said that only civilians injured within 12 hours of the attack were eligible for the fund, but the final rules contemplated by Kenneth R. Feinberg, the fund's special master, would extend that to 72 hours for those who worked at the World Trade Center and would remove the time limit for the uniformed rescue workers who responded to the attack.
Combined, these changes could add hundreds of millions to the final cost of the fund, previously estimated at $6 billion.
The final rules, scheduled to be released this week, are still subject to last-minute change by the White House and by Mr. Feinberg, who was appointed to oversee the fund by Attorney General John Ashcroft.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Feinberg refused to discuss many of the specifics of the new rules, emphasizing that several crucial details had yet to be decided. But he stressed that new fund rules, some of which were first reported in this week's edition of Newsweek, have been extensively revised or clarified to address as many criticisms as possible from families and their representatives in Congress.
"I want to make it as attractive as possible, and I hope I've done so," he said of the fund. "That is a formidable task when dealing with these families, but I'm trying to make it attractive. That is the goal."
Also under discussion are final rules that would include special protections for the families of illegal immigrants, including written assurances that immigration authorities would not try to penalize their families, according to New York officials who have been monitoring the rules. The original rules had required families to waive their right to sue before filing a claim, but the final rules would let families first obtain a "ballpark" estimate of their award from fund officials before having to make such a decision.
"These proposed modifications are designed primarily with the lower- and middle-income wage earner in mind," Mr. Feinberg said. "I am most concerned in this program with the families at the bottom end."
But the administration and Mr. Feinberg have also made changes to address complaints by powerful interests, from the Association of Trial Lawyers of America to New York politicians, including Gov. George E. Pataki, and the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer.
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Spitzer objected to a proposed rule that would have given families only two hours to present their cases to Mr. Feinberg's hearing officers. That language has been struck, according to several people who have spoken to Mr. Feinberg. The new rules will give families whatever time they need.
Likewise, Leo V. Boyle, president of the trial lawyers group, expressed concerns that the draft rules improperly limited Mr. Feinberg's authority to make awards as he deemed appropriate. The new rules make clear Mr. Feinberg's discretion in several areas, Congressional staff members said. 
"There has been a willing and open ear from both the administration and Feinberg to the concerns of both the victims and those who argue their case," said Senator Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey.
The Victims Compensation Fund was established in September as part of emergency legislation to bail out the airline industry. The fund covers families of those who died, and anyone physically injured by the attacks. Those who file claims with the fund are guaranteed payment for their economic and noneconomic losses within 120 days of their formal filing. But they must also waive their right to file lawsuits against the airlines and other potential defendants.
The law gave Mr. Feinberg enormous power over families affected by the disaster. There are no appeals from his awards, and he has broad authority to interpret the regulations. In December, when Mr. Feinberg announced draft rules for the fund, he estimated that, on average, families of those who died would receive awards of $1.6 million, although he cautioned that the law also required him to deduct life insurance and government benefits. 
Families and the leaders of victims' groups heaped criticism on the proposed rules, and have since campaigned for dozens of changes by staging protest rallies, meeting with members of Congress and bombarding Mr. Feinberg and the Justice Department with proposed revisions. But by far, their most vehement objections have focused on a single provision: the proposed awards for noneconomic losses, which they have called insulting and degrading.
In meeting after meeting, Mr. Feinberg has steadfastly defended his proposed noneconomic awards, $250,000 per death with an additional $50,000 for each spouse and each dependent. He said he was open to compromise on a host of other fund rules, but he said that the noneconomic awards were unlikely to change.
But in discussions with victims' groups and leaders from New York and New Jersey, Mr. Feinberg and White House officials have signaled they are preparing to double the $50,000 payments. For a mother of two children, that change would increase her family's overall award for noneconomic losses by $150,000, to a total of $550,000.
Mr. Corzine said that based on his recent conversations with the White House he was hopeful that the proposed $250,000 award would be increased, perhaps substantially.
By some calculations, the combination of higher noneconomic awards and reduced deductions could result in average awards as much as $200,000 higher than those previously projected.
Yesterday afternoon, in a meeting with 50 or so victims and relatives, Mr. Feinberg described several revisions that would greatly expand the number of injured people eligible for awards. 
Under the draft rules, a person had to have been injured within 12 hours of the attacks and treated by a doctor within 24 hours. Rescue and recovery workers were covered if their injury was sustained within 96 hours of the attacks. In any event, victims had to have "contemporaneous" medical records documenting the injury.
But the final rules, Mr. Feinberg said, increase the limit for civilians to 72 hours from 12 hours. The 96-hour limit for rescue workers would be eliminated altogether. Even those rescue workers who waited weeks to seek medical care would be eligible, so long as their injury resulted in a disability. What's more, he said, the final rules would eliminate the requirement for contemporaneous medical records. 
"If you didn't get a record right away, that's O.K. as long as you eventually got the record," he said. The audience applauded enthusiastically.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Companies try a new approach and a smaller screen for product placements: video games.

BYLINE:  By Karen J. Bannan 

 BODY:
AS anyone who bought Reese's Pieces after watching "ET" knows, product placement can be an effective marketing tool. Fast forward 20 years as the concept has moved to video games.
 Enter Quiksilver, a niche clothing manufacturer, whose intended customers are extreme-sport participants, teenagers and young adults who want to look like the skateboarders and snowboarders who snap up the company's board shorts and sunglasses. 
 The company advertised its wares by sponsoring and dressing popular extreme sports athletes. But then last fall, Quiksilver broadened its marketing by putting its shirts and shorts into several top-selling video games, produced by Activision Inc. 
Today, even though Quiksilver items are not sold at mass merchants like Wal-Mart and Target, it uses those stores as a way to get its message out, says Taylor Whisenand, the company's director for marketing. When teenagers and young adults buy games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 at Target, they are also buying a virtual catalog of Quiksilver's clothing and accessories.
"The alignment with Activision enables us to get into the core shops," Mr. Whisenand said. "Most gamers go to Wal-Mart, and now we're there, too."
Quiksilver, which is based in Huntington Beach, Calif., joins a growing list of companies including PepsiCo, DaimlerChrysler and Nokia that are using video game product placement and advertising as a way to increase brand awareness.
And with revenue of video games closing in on yearly domestic movie box-office receipts -- video game software sales reached $6 billion last year while movie tickets topped the $8.4 billion mark, according to the market research firm NPD -- the list of advertisers is only expected to grow.
According to Forrester Research, video game product placements will generate $705 million by 2005, money that can ease the cost of video game development.
Today, the bulk of video game advertising involves bartered product placements like the Activision deal with Quiksilver. Under the agreement, Quiksilver's products including T-shirts and board shorts are placed within Activision's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer games.
In return, Activision can distribute its games in Quiksilver retail stores. Buyers can play Activision games on a kiosk and buy the games if they like.
Paid product placements are also catching on, changing the way advertisers do business. In contrast to newspapers, radio or television, with video games there is no quantitative way of finding out how many eyeballs are looking. Advertisers and publishers can base rates on unit sales projections, but since most video games are used in group situations and some video games have longer shelf lives than others, it is not always practical. This creates the need for a new advertising pricing structure, said Beth Larson, vice president for advertising sales for Electronic Arts, the game developer based in Redwood City, Calif. 
"We've gone to marketers and said, 'Help us figure out how to define the impressions and how we can do the auditing.' " Ms. Larson said.
"We've done quite a bit of research about how many players touch the games and how many hours each game is played," Ms. Larson added. Electronic Arts expects to earn $1 million in product placements this year alone, she said.
Ads can be as basic as a billboard or banner that appears during the game and as complex as sponsored hidden levels that users can only reach by visiting an advertiser's Web site.
When video game consoles gain online connectivity -- something expected to occur later this year -- in-game advertising could include sponsored networked video game tournaments and direct links to online shopping sites, video game developers say.
But unlike movie or television product placements, video game advertising draws the user into becoming part of the entertainment. The difference is pretty clear: instead of just seeing a brand or product, video game players can interact with it, again and again and again.
Take Darkened Skye, due out for Nintendo's GameCube console later this year. The role-playing game has plenty of monsters and fighting, but it also uses Skittles candy from Mars Inc. as a magical catalyst. Given that most games can take several hundred hours to complete, that is a lot of brain candy reaching consumers.
Advertisers and agencies see the value in such deals. 
"It's fantastic," said Jeff Odiorne, founder of the San Francisco-based advertising agency Odiorne, Wilde, Narraway, & Partners. "The reason is, you're not invading their space like a TV commercial or a radio commercial that interrupts something that they are enjoying."
Although there has been no official research on the effectiveness of video game advertising, game developers say their own research shows young users respond to in-game advertising in a positive manner. 
"If a kid breaks through a sheet of glass that's got a Doritos logo on it, they associate that brand with something cool," Ms. Larson said. "Because the end user is interacting with the brand in a fun way, they tend to notice it more."
Indeed, some innovative placements take on lives of their own. For example, Electronic Arts placed an ad for Duff beer -- a fictional brand from "The Simpsons" -- in its baseball game Triple Play 2000. The small ad spurred Web pages and discussions that went on for months.
One executive says such advertising is integral to the video games because it makes them more realistic.
"Endemic brands in action and sports games lend authenticity," said Will Kassoy, senior director of global brand management for Activision's action sports division. "We've found the more games represent the real world, the cooler the game is perceived to be."
Virtual baseball stadiums therefore need billboards behind second base and race cars need sponsor logos on their doors and hoods.
But another executive cautions that video game advertising is only as effective as its presentation.
"It's both an art and a science," said Perrin Kaplan, vice president for corporate affairs for Nintendo of Japan, who is based in Redmond, Wash. "You have to look at how the ad was done and whether or not it's going to stick," she said.
So far, placements in general seem to be sticking. As a result, video game developers say there is no shortage of advertisers looking for placements or in-game ads.
"This is one of the first years we've got major agencies coming to us and asking us if they can place ads in our games," Mr. Kassoy said. "They are finally realizing that games reach a desirable audience."

HEADLINE: Credit Agency Drops Rating On the Debt Of New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 4 

 BODY:
Warning that the stock market's sluggish performance was likely to suppress New Jersey's tax revenues for years to come, a major credit rating agency lowered the rating today on more than $14 billion in state bonds.
 The downgrade by Moody's Investors Service came after New Jersey reported that income tax receipts for December and January were $700 million less than expected when the budget was adopted last summer. 
 In announcing the move, analysts commended Gov. James E. McGreevey for his plan to balance this year's budget by imposing across-the-board spending cuts and by using surpluses in several pension and health care accounts. But New Jersey faces a projected shortfall of more than $5 billion for the fiscal year that begins on July 1, and with the stock market showing few signs of a sustained rally, financial analysts said the state must take more drastic steps to address longer-term deficits. 
Timothy Blake, a municipal analyst for Moody's, said that New Jersey's budget was heavily dependent on income taxes paid by people whose earnings come from stock dividends or profits or who work on Wall Street and receive large bonuses tied to the stock market's performance.
"We don't think the kind of revenue we saw in the 90's will be seen for another four or five years," Mr. Blake said. "The whole economic environment has changed, and the state's whole spending plan needs to be adjusted to reflect that sizable, fundamental shift."
Mr. McGreevey, who has been warning about the budget problems since he won election last fall, said the downgrade underscored the need for New Jersey's state and local officials to drastically curtail spending. Mr. McGreevey is scheduled to offer his budget proposal on March 26, and he has already warned local communities and school boards that they will not receive the increases in state aid they were expecting.
Moody's downgraded $3.5 billion of the state's general obligation bonds from Aa1 to Aa2, its third-highest rating. The agency also reduced the rating on $7.2 billion of state lease and appropriation-backed debt to Aa3, from Aa2, and $4.1 billion of lease and appropriation-backed debt to A1, from Aa3.
Mr. Blake said that New Jersey's bond rating was still higher than that of 34 other states because of the state's high per capita income and diverse economy. But he said that financial analysts were concerned because the state had increased its debt significantly during the past decade and had committed itself to expensive long-term projects to rebuild its schools and roads.
Mr. McGreevey has also pledged not to raise taxes, eliminating one possible remedy for the deficit, and even with his effort to hold down spending, the state is expecting increased costs for health care, education, transportation, pensions and interest on outstanding debts.
The downgrading of New Jersey's bonds could also aggravate the budget problem by increasing the cost of borrowing. In addition to its existing debt, the McGreevey administration is hoping to raise as much as $2 billion next fiscal year by borrowing against its $7 billion share of the settlement with tobacco companies.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Software: Aether ToCut 25% Of Work Force 

BYLINE:  The New York Times (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Aether Systems, which develops software and wireless data products and services, said it would cut about 225 jobs, or about 25 percent of its work force, because of the economic downturn and a slower adoption of wireless data technologies than the company expected. 
Aether said it would cut expenses, consolidate sites and streamline its European venture, Sila Communications, in an effort to cut operating costs and become profitable. The company, in Owings Mills, Md., said it would take a charge of about $11 million in the first quarter for the revamping. Aether said operating expenses would decrease throughout the year, from about $40 million in the first quarter to roughly $20 million for the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: For Executives, Nest Egg Is Wrapped in a Security Blanket 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
General Electric allows its top executives to contribute money to a retirement fund on which the company recently guaranteed an annual return of at least 10 percent, far better than a typical G.E. worker saving money in the company's 401(k) plan can expect.
 Tenneco Automotive, which makes shock absorbers, permits its executives to receive a full pension at age 55, seven years before the company's other employees can. 
 When Louis V. Gerstner retired as I.B.M.'s chief executive last week, he became eligible for an annual pension of at least $1.1 million, precisely what the company promised in his contract when he joined eight years ago. As part of a 1999 cost-cutting program, however, many I.B.M. employees are set to receive smaller pensions and retirement health insurance benefits than they were promised when they were hired.
Such contrasts have become the norm over the last two decades, as the United States has increasingly developed a two-tier pension system. Companies seeking to increase profits have cut retirement benefits, leaving many members of the baby boom generation unprepared for life after age 65 despite the long bull market, economists say. 
But executives have persuaded their directors to reward them with ever-larger pay packages. On top of millions in salary, bonus and stock options, many top managers have received pensions that are more generous than they once were and are often devoid of the risk inherent in the typical 401(k) plans that have replaced the old company pension for many workers.
Some companies give their executives large annual payments and guaranteed investment returns. Others, including Bank of America and Estee Lauder, pay the premiums on life insurance policies for executives, allowing them, or their heirs, to collect cash payments decades after retirement. Delta Air Lines and the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, as well as other companies give executives credit for many more years of service than they actually have, increasing their pensions.
In recent weeks, policy makers have focused attention on the plight of workers at Enron and Global Crossing, who had invested most of their retirement savings in company stock that is now almost worthless. Many executives escaped in much better shape, having received multimillion-dollar payments or sold many shares before the companies filed for bankruptcy and their share prices plummeted.
Far more common, however, are the diverging of fortunes at healthy companies like G.E. and I.B.M. From 1983 to 1998, the last year for which the government has published data, the amount of retirement money held by the typical household with people from age 47 to 64 fell 11 percent after being adjusted for inflation, according to a recent study by Prof. Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University. That number includes private pensions and the value of anticipated Social Security benefits.
The decline occurred as many companies replaced traditional pensions, which pay a predetermined annual benefit, with voluntary savings programs like the 401(k). While higher-income workers were able to save a significant part of their salaries and benefit from the stock market's run-up, many other workers found it hard to set aside money for retirement. At the same time, companies were cutting their retirement contributions as they switched to 401(k) programs.
Expected Social Security benefits have also declined since the early 1980's because inflation-adjusted earnings have fallen for most workers. 
"A lot of families are going to have to work more years to build up their pension accounts and generate enough income for retirement," Professor Wolff said. "It's basically a decrease in living standards."
Executives, meanwhile, have sweetened their pensions, ensuring that the plans will be generous even if the company's stock, or the market as a whole, is suffering, pay consultants say. 
Judith Fischer, managing director of Executive Compensation Advisory Services, said, "In the early 90's, when risk reared its ugly head" and a recession brought down many share prices, "executives went back to their companies and said, 'Look, let's add a little something extra to abate the risk.' "
As a result, Ms. Fischer added, "Executive retirement plans and employee retirement plans are really no longer recognizable as related."
There are no broad statistics on executive retirement programs, in part because companies are not required to publish many of the details. While companies must report the salary, bonus and stock award for each of the top five executives, they can lump together pension liabilities without specifying how much is owed to executives and how much is owed to other employees.
The boom in executive pensions began in the 1980's, after the federal government enacted a law limiting the amount of an employee's salary that a company can consider when contributing to pension coffers. Executives quickly flipped the purpose of the law by establishing separate retirement plans for themselves, divorcing their financial interests from company pensions.
In many cases, executive pensions give benefits that are far more generous than rank-and-file workers receive, even after the differences in salaries are taken into account. Bank One adopted a plan in 1998 that pays top executives up to 60 percent of the average of the final five years of their salary, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Tenneco, in calculating pensions, multiplies its employees' compensation by the number of years they have worked at the company. Top executives receive up to 4 percent of this sum annually; other employees receive up to 1.6 percent.
Fewer than one-fifth of all workers in the United States have a traditional defined-benefit pension, said Annika Sunden, an economist at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The typical private pension pays about $6,000 a year.
At some companies, including the Interpublic Group, an advertising agency, and Mattel, the toymaker, executives can begin receiving a full pension at age 60. 
According to the original contract for Mr. Gerstner, who is 60, his pension will be at least $1.1 million a year. The company will announce any additional benefits in a filing later this year, an I.B.M. spokesman, Rob Wilson, said.
That has angered some of I.B.M.'s 319,000 employees, many of whom lost benefits in 1999 when the company changed its pension program.
"It's just horrible that these companies are getting away with this," said Lynda P. French, a 57-year-old former I.B.M. software analyst in Austin, Tex., who used the Internet to organize employee opposition to the pension changes. "These C.E.O.'s are escalating their golden parachutes while they're cutting from the workers."
Ms. French said that I.B.M. had recently raised her health care premiums and that when her husband retires from the company, their health care benefits would be less generous than those received by previous generations of retirees.
Phil Nigh, a 41-year-old engineer in Essex Junction, Vt., who has worked for I.B.M. since 1983, said his pension would probably be 25 percent to 40 percent lower than it would have been before the company changed the plan.
"In my opinion, people lost a lot of trust in executive decisions" after the change, Mr. Nigh said. "They assumed I.B.M. would live up to its promises, and this kind of woke everybody up."
Mr. Wilson, the I.B.M. spokesman, said Mr. Gerstner's pension was not affected by the 1999 change because it was part of the contract between him and the company. "They are two separate things," Mr. Wilson said, referring to Mr. Gerstner's pension and that of other employees.
Since Enron's collapse, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said that some pension rules should be changed to prevent bankruptcy filings from hurting only lower-level employees. But the most prominent proposals, including President Bush's, would not alter basic rules covering executive pensions.
Pay consultants say the issue is often difficult to understand because many benefits are not made public, and those that are disclosed can be complicated. 
One common perk is a life insurance policy on which a company pays the premiums. Executives can cash out of the policy while they are still alive or the benefits will be paid to heirs. Before the insurance company pays the benefits, it subtracts the combined amount of the premiums and pays this amount to the company -- minus any interest.
"It's like the company is making an interest-free loan," said David M. Leach, the director of the compensation practice at Buck Consultants in New York. "It's losing the use of its money."
Many other executive benefits remain hidden from investors and employees because the S.E.C. does not require that all plans be fully explained.
"These are obligations that companies have that they are not disclosing to shareholders," said Carol Bowie, a director at the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. "With executives, you're dealing with a group of people who have very few controls on what they can do."

GRAPHIC: Photos (Bloomberg News; Associated Press; Fort Worth Star-Telegram)(pg. C4) Chart: "Golden Nest Eggs"Executive pensions provide benefits that are more generous than those of rank-and-file workers. ABOVE-MARKET INTERESTTop executives of General Electric, including chief exec-utive Jeffrey R. Immelt, below, can contribute up to 50 percent of their salary to an account that the company guarantees will pay an interest rate well above what any bank would pay. In 2000, the rate was 12 percent. LIFE INSURANCEEstee Lauder is paying the premiums on a $20 million life insurance policy for Fred Langhammer, above, its chief executive. The program is akin to an interest-free loan. When Mr. Langhammer dies, the policy will reimburse the company for the premiums and pay the remaining benefit to his estate. EXAGGERATED TENUREBefore 2000, Donald J. Carty, below, chief executive of American Airlines, received credit for a year and a half of service for every year he worked. Forgoing a raise, Mr. Carty was able to increase the ratio to two-to-one. The length of tenure is crucial to determining retirement benefits. EARLY BENEFITSMark Frissora, above, the chief executive, and other top executives of Tenneco Automotive can retire at age 55. They can receive an annual payment equal to the number of years they worked at the company, multiplied by 4 percent of the average of their final three years of salary and bonus. At most, the executive can receive half of that figure. (Source: Executive Compensation Advisory Services)(pg. C4)

HEADLINE: Bush Edging Toward Decision on Steel Imports 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
The White House edged toward a final decision today to impose tariffs on imported steel, as President Bush weighed recommendations from his advisers and last-minute pleas from an array of competing interests.
 Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush intended to make his decision by Wednesday but had not yet signed off on all the elements of a plan. Administration officials have signaled that Mr. Bush is leaning toward a combination of tariffs and quotas that would vary with the specific type of steel involved and that would probably exempt some developing nations as well as Mexico and Canada. "It's not a settled matter at this time," Mr. Fleischer said. 
 People involved in the debate over how far the United States should go in protecting the industry -- and the jobs it provides in political battleground states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio -- said the issue's complexity was underscored for Mr. Bush last week when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain raised it with him in a phone call.
Mr. Blair, who has made Britain perhaps the staunchest ally of the United States in the war on terrorism, suggested to Mr. Bush that restricting imports would not be the right response to the problems facing the steel industry in the United States, people who have been briefed on the discussion said.
Today, the British Trade Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, said Britain would support trade retaliation by the European Union if the United States imposed tariffs on steel. 
Trade officials on both sides of the Atlantic -- as well as those in China and Russia -- are already bracing for a knockdown fight over steel, one that they are concerned could slow the already halting progress toward a new round of world trade liberalization talks.
But the most immediate calculations facing Mr. Bush are domestic.
Having floated the outlines of its approach recently, the administration heard today from steel makers, unions, users of steel and other groups with an interest in the outcome. The general message was that any effort to find a middle ground would leave all sides unhappy.
Mr. Fleischer acknowledged as much, likening the issue to a Rubik's Cube, where any move to help one side causes problems with another. "The president understands how very many sides there are on this issue," he said.
The nation's remaining big steel makers, which have seen their ranks mowed down by a succession of bankruptcies, are pushing the administration to impose tariffs of up to 40 percent on most types of steel imports from all over the world. 
The big companies, led by U.S. Steel, say a period of protection from what they consider unfair foreign competition would allow them to regroup, consolidate and invest in more efficient equipment that would enable them to survive. Without the help, they say, most of the industry will wither away, along with tens of thousands of jobs.
Users of steel, however, say that steep tariffs and the ensuing rise in steel prices would drive up their costs, leading to job losses across a wide swath of industry.
Representatives of the big steel companies said the administration would be making a mistake if it exempted developing countries from the tariffs and allowed some portion of the steel from other countries to come in free of tariffs. They said the practical effect of such a compromise would be to set tariff levels so low that they would be ineffectual.
If developing nations are exempted and if a portion of the unfinished slab steel coming into the United States is not subject to the tariffs, the domestic industry "would get close to no relief," said Robert Lighthizer, a Washington trade lawyer who represents U.S. Steel and some of the other steel makers.
Leo Gerard, president of the steel workers' union, said exemption of developing countries would have to be accompanied by a strict program to guard against a surge of imports from them and to keep developed countries from evading the tariffs by shipping their steel through the developing nations.
But representatives of groups lobbying the administration not to impose heavy tariffs said the compromise floated by the White House would still extract much too heavy a price from the economy.

HEADLINE: Pataki Avoids Vow to Serve Full 3rd Term If Re-elected 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 4 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki, who has at times entertained thoughts of a run for national office, today would not commit to serving a full four-year term if he is re-elected this year.
 The governor, speaking at a news conference in the State Capitol, sought to quell reports that he might find a new running mate to replace Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue, who would become governor if he were to leave office early. 
 But when asked if he would promise to serve out a third term, he said: "Let's take things step by step. And the next political decision is to announce that we're running. Beyond that, we'll make those determinations when we get to them."
He offered a similar caveat minutes earlier when asked about Ms. Donohue's status, but followed it with a far more definitive reply. "If I do" run, he said, "I fully expect that Mary Donohue would be the running mate."
Whenever the subject of his political plans is raised, Mr. Pataki insists that he has not definitively decided to run again, and suggests that any discussion of his future is premature. Yet he routinely concedes that he is likely to seek re-election -- "I expect that I will," he said today. His allies say it is a foregone conclusion, and he acts every bit the candidate, raising money at a daunting clip and making alliances with various political figures and interest groups.
Mr. Pataki tested the presidential waters in 1999 with a brief foray to New Hampshire and speeches in nationally prominent forums. A year later, his advisers said, he hoped George W. Bush would offer him the vice-presidential nomination. And people close to the governor say he would like to be considered for such an offer again in 2004, if Vice President Dick Cheney does not run.
His Democratic critics jumped at Mr. Pataki's evasion today, accusing him of looking past New York to Washington at a time when his state is battered by financial trouble. Both Democratic candidates for governor, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, have vowed to serve a full term if elected.
"He's creating budget problems for New York, and he refuses to commit to be here to clean up the mess he's creating," Hank Sheinkopf, Mr. McCall's chief strategist, said of Mr. Pataki.
The news about the state budget got worse today, as the governor's office reported that state revenues for January and February were $500 million below even the pessimistic estimates it made in mid-January. That is in addition to an estimated $7 billion shortfall over 18 months caused by the recession and the World Trade Center attack. "We still have a real financial crisis," Mr. Pataki said.
Josh Isay, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager, dismissed any talk of Mr. Pataki on the national ticket as "a joke."
"Sixty percent of eighth graders read below grade level, upstate New York has the slowest job growth in the nation, and we have the highest state and local tax burden in the country," he said.
It is not clear that Mr. Pataki would be hurt politically by a continued refusal to pledge to serve his entire term. He declined to make such a promise in 1998, yet won re-election handily. He has said he does not feel bound by his 1994 promise to serve no more than two terms, yet remains highly popular.
Mr. Cuomo's father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, also declined to promise to serve out his terms and was widely expected to run for president, yet he easily won re-election in 1986 and 1990. In fact, since the 19th century, New Yorkers have taken for granted the idea that their governors are White House contenders, and many voters like it that way.
Democrats said the danger to the governor might lie not in his national aspirations but in the possibility that by refusing to promise to serve his entire term, Mr. Pataki is reinforcing the perception -- avidly fed by those same Democrats -- that he has lost interest in the job. Mr. Sheinkopf drew a parallel to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, who resigned in 1973 with a year left on his term, departing just as a fiscal crisis was about to envelop New York.
Mr. Pataki dropped his first lieutenant governor, Betsy McCaughey Ross, from the ticket in 1998, and several published reports have had him and his advisers weighing doing the same to Ms. Donohue, and considering various replacements.
But Ms. Donohue, a former prosecutor and judge, has kept a low profile and has not embarrassed Mr. Pataki with the kind of public disagreements and odd behavior Ms. McCaughey Ross became known for. The governor's aides have insisted all along that Ms. Donohue was not going anywhere.

HEADLINE: Playing Politics With Trade 

 BODY:
Many corporate chieftains around the country must be scratching their heads in amazement, wondering why they worked so hard to elect a market-loving, free-trading Republican administration. Democrats are supposed to be the ones who pander to labor unions. Yet it is President Bush who is considering the ill-advised move of slapping tariffs on steel imports, one that his Democratic predecessor responsibly resisted. 
 Any such tariffs, essentially a new tax on a broad array of manufactured goods, will hurt the American economy as it struggles to rebound. The move would cost far more jobs at companies that consume steel, such as auto parts makers, than those it might save at inefficient steel companies. Moreover, such brazen protectionism could plunge the world into a bruising trade war capable of derailing the administration's ostensible goal of lifting living standards at home and abroad by breaking down barriers through a series of new trade agreements. 
 America's International Trade Commission has ruled, at the administration's behest, that imports have financially hurt the nation's steel producers. It set tomorrow as a deadline for the president to decide on what steps, if any, he will take to protect the industry. On the merits, rejecting the protectionist impulse would seem easy, as the president's top economic advisers have reportedly argued. 
They will probably be overruled, however, by politics. Some scoffed at the Bush campaign's efforts to woo steelworkers during the 2000 campaign, but Mr. Bush ultimately carried traditionally Democratic West Virginia. Without that upset Mr. Bush would still be in Austin, such was his razor-thin margin of victory. He would like to add the rich electoral prize of Pennsylvania to his win column in 2004, and help Republican Congressional candidates from steel-producing states this November. 
Yet in trying to balance the nation's economic and foreign policy concerns against his political interests, Mr. Bush might still damage the former without advancing the latter. He is reportedly going to reject Big Steel's call for a 40 percent across-the-board tariff, settling for a mix of quotas and lower tariffs that vary according to the steel product. Some poorer nations, along with Mexico and Canada, might be exempted.
That may seem like a reasonable compromise to those involved in drafting it, but it is unlikely to satisfy Big Steel. In addition to the 40 percent tariff, the industry wants a $12 billion taxpayer bailout of its troubled companies' lavish retiree pension and health care benefits. The industry says this would free steelmakers to consolidate and become more efficient. Even an administration eager to cater to West Virginia cannot support such a fanciful end run around the nation's bankruptcy laws. The president's rejection of this plea, combined with his embrace of more modest tariffs, is likely to strike those wooed steelworkers as a betrayal.
In truth, steel imports have been drastically declining since the glut caused by the Asian financial crisis. International negotiations are making progress at cutting excess capacity worldwide, and American steel production capacity remains strong. Many steel companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, admittedly, but they are as much the victims of newer, more efficient domestic competitors as of foreign competitors.
A senseless rush to impose tariffs will reinforce suspicions around the world that the United States does not believe its own preaching about the paramount importance of embracing free trade, regardless of whatever transitional pain it inflicts on some economic sectors. European and Asian nations will surely retaliate.

HEADLINE: Despite Complaining About Pay, Justices Won't Review a Ruling That Blocks Raises 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
After years of complaining about inadequate pay for federal judges, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was finally in a position to do something about it when a significant constitutional challenge to the failure by Congress to give judges promised cost-of-living increases reached the court's docket last fall.
 But the chief justice did not act, and as a result the Supreme Court fell one vote short today of accepting the case and of taking the judicial pay question into its own hands. 
 The court let stand a 2001 ruling by a federal appeals court here that Congress did not act unconstitutionally when it blocked raises for judges that would have taken place automatically four times in the last six years.
The appeals court held that the lawmakers had not violated the provision in Article III of the Constitution that guarantees to federal judges "a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office." 
The three justices who voted to hear the appeal, Stephen G. Breyer, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, dissented from the denial of review with 14 pages of legal argument and three multicolored graphs showing that federal judges have lost more to inflation than public and private employees in other occupations. The Supreme Court's rules require the votes of four justices to accept a case for review.
"This case is not about what judges' labor should be worth," the three dissenters said in an opinion by Justice Breyer. "It is about a Congressional decision in 1989 to protect federal judges against undue diminishment in real pay by providing cost-of-living adjustments to guarantee that their salaries would not fall too far behind inflation."
While Congress was free to set the level of judicial pay, Justice Breyer said, "the Compensation Clause assures judges that, once Congress has made such a decision, a later Congress cannot overturn it." The Constitution's framers viewed the clause as an essential protection for judicial independence, he said.
The case was brought as a class-action suit by 20 federal judges, led by Spencer Williams, a senior district judge in San Francisco. They argued that in passing the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Congress had struck a bargain with the judiciary on which it could not constitutionally renege.
The essence of the bargain, which included an immediate one-time 25 percent pay raise to make up for years of frozen judicial salaries, was that judges would give up the right to earn outside income, except for a small amount permitted for teaching. In return, they would join members of Congress and a group of high-level executive branch officials who would get annual cost-of-living raises of up to 5 percent, to be based on the federal index of private-sector salaries.
The raise would be automatic any time the General Schedule of federal civil servants received cost-of-living increases, which were to be annual unless the president declared a national emergency or the existence of "serious economic conditions" under which ordinary federal workers would receive no raises.
For the first several years under the law, the judges, along with members of Congress and top government officials, received their increases.
In the 1994 budget crisis, President Bill Clinton suspended all federal raises. And after the Republicans took control of both houses, Congress passed resolutions blocking the Congressional, judicial and executive raises in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999, though ordinary civil servants received their increases. That led to the judges' lawsuit.
The judges won a ruling in July 1999 in federal district court here that the promised cost-of-living adjustments were "part of the judges' compensation due and payable" and could not constitutionally be withheld. A 2-to-1 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the ruling on the ground that the closest Supreme Court precedent, a 1980 ruling on judicial pay in the case of United States v. Will, treated judicial pay increases as not "vesting" for constitutional purposes until judges had started receiving the money.
In his dissent today in Williams v. United States, No. 01-175, Justice Breyer said the appeals court decision was based on a questionable interpretation of the Will case that only the Supreme Court could resolve.
Federal judges did receive a 3.4 percent cost-of-living increase on Jan. 1, bringing the salaries of district judges to $150,000. Court of appeals judges now receive $159,100; associate Supreme Court justices, $184,400; and the chief justice, $192,600.
In his annual report on the federal judiciary, issued on Dec. 31, Chief Justice Rehnquist said the judges were "grateful" for the increase, but noted that "it only keeps judges from falling further behind the median income of the profession." He warned that it was becoming harder to recruit and retain qualified judges.
A year earlier, the chief justice said that continuing erosion of judicial pay was "the most pressing issue facing the judiciary," a statement quoted by the American Bar Association in a friend-of-the-court brief urging the justices to accept the judges' appeal.
The Supreme Court had had the appeal under active consideration since November, an unusually long time. While there is no way of knowing why the three dissenters did not pick up a fourth vote from Justice Rehnquist or any of the other five justices, one hint came in Justice Breyer's reference to concerns that "we face the serious embarrassment of deciding a matter that would directly affect our own pocketbooks." 
But reflecting what must have been the behind-the-scenes argument, he continued: "Whenever a court considers a matter where public sentiment is strong, it risks public alienation. But the American public has understood the need and the importance of judges deciding important constitutional issues without regard to considerations of popularity."

HEADLINE: Enron Pensions Still Under Old Management 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
Despite an agreement three weeks ago to replace the executives who oversee Enron's pension plans with an independent official, the retirement plans are still being supervised by the executives who did little when Enron stock plummeted last year, a senior Democratic lawmaker said today.
 Representative George Miller of California, the ranking minority member on the House Education and Work Force Committee, said he was "deeply troubled" that the executives had not been replaced. 
 Enron's 401(k) retirement plan was heavy with company stock, and employees saw the value of that plan lose more than $1 billion last year when the stock price collapsed. On Feb. 13, Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao announced an agreement to replace the officials with an independent official, paid for by Enron.
"There is convincing evidence that Enron fiduciaries had significant warning of Enron's financial collapse but failed to act to protect employees' retirement savings," Mr. Miller said. "I am deeply troubled that the administration has failed to act to protect the remaining retirement savings at Enron despite its earlier pledge to so."
Labor Department officials said they were working to secure an independent fiduciary who can take over the three pension plans and provide company employees and retirees confidence that their interests will be protected. A spokeswoman for the department said officials were optimistic an announcement would be made soon.

HEADLINE: In Manhattan, A U.N. Dispute On Real Estate (What Else?) 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
It is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's first diplomatic flap.
 This being New York, it is not about the decimation of the Brazilian rain forest, or drought in Africa, but about real estate. 
 In a series of communiques and summit meetings, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has expressed his "concerns" about the city's pending contract to sell three office towers at First Avenue and 44th Street that house a variety of United Nations agencies, including Unicef. The United Nations wants the buildings to remain in public hands sympathetic to its mission. 
The deal could bring $50 million into the city's cash-starved coffers and more than $7 million a year in annual taxes once the properties are on the tax rolls. But Mr. Bloomberg, the state and the federal government do not want to alienate the United Nations at a time when all sides are seeking to establish a newly cordial relationship in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
There are issues of public policy at stake, but no tale involving real estate and diplomacy would be complete without some sort of background maneuvering. Some executives involved in the sale wonder whether George Klein, the developer who heads the agency that was supposed to sell the buildings, actually inspired the United Nations' opposition.
Whatever the case, the deal, which was supposed to close by Feb. 6, languishes, despite the city's worsening fiscal condition and a longstanding plan to sell the properties.
"We are continuing discussions with the U.N.," Daniel Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, said yesterday. "We're making progress. The U.N. is a very important part of New York, and we're treating them like a valued partner."
Yesterday afternoon, Toshiyuki Niwa, the assistant secretary general of the United Nations, met with the prospective buyer of the buildings, a New York subsidiary of VSP Capital Holdings of Israel. Mr. Niwa said the United Nations -- in addition to concerns about having a private entity as a landlord -- is also concerned that if the sale is completed, the agency that built the towers, the United Nations Development Corporation, would go out of business and be unable to assist the United Nations in its proposed $1 billion renovation project.
"We expressed our concerns about the ownership transfer," Mr. Niwa said. "We feel the current arrangement should stay in place. "The U.N.D.C. symbolizes the special relationship between the United Nations and the city and state," Mr. Niwa said. "I get the impression there is a difference of opinion within the administration" of Mayor Bloomberg.
The buildings are the only remaining assets of the U.N.D.C., created decades ago by the city and the state to assist the United Nations in developing office space for its agencies. Beginning in the mid-1990's, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki sought to privatize the agency's real estate by selling the buildings.
The first one on the auction block was the United Nations Plaza Hotel, sold in 1997. The deal produced $85 million for the city and an estimated $6 million in annual taxes. The agency later sold office space in the building at 633 Third Ave. for about $52 million, or $5.5 million after the mortgage was paid off. Two small buildings on First Avenue sold for less than $6 million.
A year ago, the U.N.D.C. voted at the urging of Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki to sell the three office buildings known as 1, 2 and 3 U.N. Plaza. Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate company, began marketing the buildings. Publicly, everyone was in agreement.
But at the board meetings of the U.N.D.C., Mr. Klein, the developer who has long chaired the agency, clashed with Leo Kayser, a lawyer appointed by Governor Pataki, over privatization, according to several directors at the agency.
"Kayser and George Klein would just go after each other," one former U.N.D.C. director said. "The arguments were about how to do it, never about whether to do it. If George had ever raised the issue of not selling, he would not have been allowed to stay on as chairman."
Mr. Klein, who has told executives that he favors public ownership of the buildings, declined comment, as did Roy Goodman, the U.N.D.C. president appointed by Mr. Bloomberg. Some current and former directors suggested that Mr. Klein did not want to see what one called his "fiefdom" disappear with the sale.
"It's a well-functioning patronage operation," said one former director who had been appointed by Mr. Giuliani. "You put your friends there."
On Oct. 24, Mr. Annan wrote letters to both the city and the state objecting to the sale. The agency went ahead anyway on Dec. 6 and signed a contract to sell the buildings for about $160 million to VSP Capital, which also agreed to put another $12 million on improvements.
But with Mr. Giuliani on his way out of office, the United Nations stepped up its opposition, joined by the United States ambassador to the organization, John Negroponte. Several people involved in the sale suggested that the United Nations had been stirred into action by Mr. Klein.
Mr. Niwa did not say that Mr. Klein had instigated the letters from Mr. Annan. But, Mr. Niwa added, "He certainly welcomed our initiative."
"My feeling all along is that Mr. Klein favored the status quo," he said. "But at the same time, a sales contract was signed. The letters were a last ditch effort to remind the city and the state about how we feel."
Mr. Doctoroff acknowledged that Mr. Klein had been raising questions about the sale after having voted in favor of it. "But he's backed off that," Mr. Doctoroff said.
Mr. Doctoroff said he is now trying to correct some misconceptions about the deal and understand it economically. "We are sensitive to the issues and concerns of the U.N.," he said.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Telecommunications:Verizon To Trim Equivalent Of 10,000 Jobs 

BYLINE:  By Simon Romero (NYT) (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Verizon Communications, the nation's largest local telephone company, plans to eliminate the equivalent of about 10,000 jobs this year, mainly through the reduction of overtime and contract positions. 
Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon's chief executive, told investors at a conference in Orlando, Fla., that the company was trying to cut costs because of slower sales growth caused by a sluggish economy. Verizon had about 247,000 employees at the end of 2001, compared with about 263,000 a year earlier. Simon Romero (NYT)

HEADLINE: Australia Is Riding Its Own Cycle 

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, March 3 

 BODY:
What global slowdown?
 Almost alone among modern economies, Australia sailed unscathed through 2001 and will probably grow steadily for the rest of 2002, according to the central bank, market economists and the latest statistics. 
 Bullishness is everywhere. A new survey of the spending plans of Australian companies found that in aggregate they intended to invest 21 percent more in the coming fiscal year, which begins on July 1, than they planned to spend in the current year when surveyed in early 2001. That is the biggest jump in a decade. 
More jobs were created in January than in any other month in the last decade. The stock market is near its high. The economy is growing at a robust pace of nearly 4 percent a year. Inflation is low to moderate. 
"The economy has held up quite well in the face of international weakness, and it should continue to do so for some time at least," said Glenn Stevens, deputy governor of Australia's central bank.
That Australia is bucking the global trend is all the more remarkable given the country's dependence on exports of commodities and raw materials. In the past, that situation has made Australia acutely sensitive to the economic health of its trading partners. 
"In past periods of global downturn, Australia has rarely outperformed the major countries," Mr. Stevens said. "Historically, our tendency was to have a period of weakness that was, if anything, more pronounced."
Australia's exports have indeed been affected by the slowdown elsewhere, remaining flat last year after growth rates as high as 25 percent in earlier years. 
But this time around, both household and business investment remained steady, and company profits held up as exports slowed. That has lifted the stock market here while other countries' exchanges suffered retreats of 20 to 30 percent from the levels of early 2000.
"In Australia, signs of increased confidence in financial markets have, in many respects, been more pronounced than in other countries," the central bank said in a recent statement.
Much of the credit for the country's continued vibrancy goes, economists say, to the weakness of the Australian dollar. Its value has hovered around 48 American cents for more than a year, near the cheapest it has ever been.
The cheap currency "has been a competitive advantage for Australia," said Tony Meer, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. 
Most of the country's commodity exports, like copper and gold, are priced and sold in American dollars, but producers pay most of their costs in Australian dollars, so the exchange-rate trend has swelled their profits.
"Revenue has been good, which underpins profit, which underpins investment," Mark Rider, chief economist at UBS Warburg in Sydney, said of the country's mining industry, one of its most important sectors.
But business investment has not run amok, a common problem in boom times.
As a portion of gross domestic product, spending on new plants and equipment remains well below peak levels of the 1990's; it has helped sustain the economy but has not sent it into overdrive, economists say.
For consumers, the weaker currency made imports expensive, but consumers switched to buying domestic goods rather than cutting back, another boon for the economy. "Household spending has continued to grow at a solid pace," the central bank said.
Another factor has been the timing of a federal election. Critics worried that politically motivated tax cuts and extra spending approved by Prime Minister John Howard in the months leading up to voting would overstimulate the economy.
The measures undoubtedly won votes for Mr. Howard, now in his third term, though they drained away a government budget surplus. But as it happened, Mr. Meer said, "the election pork-barreling that we had turned out to be quite fortuitous," giving Australia a small boost just as much of the global economy was braking after the terror attacks of Sept. 11.
The Australian central bank also relaxed interest rates six times in 2001, after moves by the Federal Reserve and others.
But one of the biggest factors pushing the Australian economy has been a housing boom, caused in part by a program of sizable grants to first-time buyers. The program will soon expire, but the extra construction activity and jobs it created should persist for another six months or so, economists said.
Overall strength in the real estate market has bred consumer confidence and higher investment.
Average home prices in Australia are high relative to average household incomes, and two-thirds of Australians' personal wealth is in their homes.
In the United States, the average homeowner has net home equity equivalent to about 1.5 years of disposable income; the Australian average is more than 3.5 years, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Unlike Americans, Australians have not borrowed to the hilt. "Household and corporate balance sheets are, by and large, in pretty good shape," Mr. Stevens said.
Even consumer prices, usually the No. 1 worry in boom times, are tame here. Inflation is expected to taper off from its current 3.1 percent pace to around 2.5 percent for the full year, according to the central bank. Economists expect rapidly rising productivity to offset rises in labor costs.
There are still signs of risk on the edges of the central bank's monitor, however, notably in the direction of Japan, and it is hard to forecast when or how the rest of the world will recover from the present slowdown.
"No economy can remain insulated from global problems indefinitely," Mr. Stevens said.
Even so, robust optimism can be detected filtering through the subdued and qualified central banker's language Mr. Stevens generally uses. If recent positive signs in the United States and elsewhere gather momentum, he allowed, "Australia's prospects are pretty good."

HEADLINE: Egypt Hopes for Free Trade Pact With U.S. 

BYLINE:  By ABEER ALLAM 

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 5 

 BODY:
As President Hosni Mubarak visits Washington this week, high on his agenda is getting substantial talks started on a free trade agreement with the United States -- an idea that seemed far off before Sept. 11.
 Egypt's economy has taken a beating since last year's terror attacks, mainly from the sharp falloff in international tourism. Egypt says it needs help to build up trade with the United States beyond the fairly modest $4.2 billion in volume recorded last year, especially in clothing and textiles, which are sharply constrained by American import quotas. A sweeping elimination of trade barriers, like the agreements the United States has with Israel and Jordan, is called for, Egyptian officials say. 
 Egypt has wanted such an agreement with the United States for years, but before Sept. 11 Washington rebuffed its approaches, citing a long list of steps that Egypt would have to complete first. Issues like customs delays and red tape, weak protection for copyrights and trademarks, tax complications, the glacial pace of privatization and concerns about money laundering would have to be settled, Cairo was told. 
But when the Egyptian trade minister, Youssef Boutros Ghali, visited Washington last fall before the World Trade Organization's November conference in Qatar, he got a much warmer response. The State Department said after the visit that the United States "would boost efforts to help as Egypt struggles to cope with a decline in tourism due to terrorism fears," and that "one method of assistance is a United States-Egypt free trade agreement." 
After growing steadily through most of the 1990's, Egypt has suffered setbacks over the last three years. The Egyptian pound sank in value despite the government's expensive efforts to shore it up; it declined 20 percent last year, to 4.55 to the dollar. Some 55 state-owned companies were due to be privatized in 2001, but only a few were actually sold. Those factors contributed to a sharp fall in foreign investment, to $333 million in 2001 from $2 billion the year before; so did investors' persistent complaints of excessive bureaucracy and lack of transparency, despite efforts at reform.
Just as Egypt's economy was slowing, American financial aid began to contract, in tandem with aid to Israel, to free up money for Jordan and other new partners in the region. In 1997, Vice President Al Gore promised a concerted effort to redirect the Egyptian-American relationship "from aid to trade." 
Washington promoted a plan to extend the duty-free access granted under Israel's free trade agreement to include some products manufactured in designated industrial zones in Egypt, Jordan and territory administered by the Palestinian Authority. But when the peace process fell apart and Arab-Israeli tensions rose, Egypt said it could not make use of the special zones, known as Q.I.Z.'s.
"Given what Israel is doing now, I don't think Q.I.Z.'s are an option," Mr. Boutros Ghali said in an interview with the Oxford Business Group this month.
The United States is Egypt's biggest single trading partner, and, by value, America exports three times the amount to Egypt that it imports. American exporters stand to lose market share in Egypt without a free trade agreement, Cairo officials say, because of a new deal with the European Union to lower tariffs gradually over 12 years. 
"With a free trade agreement, both sides gain," said Ahmed Galal, managing director of the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies. "Without it, the United States will lose out, especially in information technology, telecommunications and e-commerce, while European investors will come to Egypt to export duty free to the E.U."
But the odds remain long, American officials say, and Egypt is not yet in shape to reap the full benefit of a trade deal. 
"The United States has very few free trade agreements, and getting in the queue to have one is a challenge," one United States official in Cairo said. "Countries who want to do this need the political stamina to make major changes, but the payoffs are enormous."

HEADLINE: Reality Video, All Too Stark; 
Preacher Hopes Taping Can Save a Drug-Riddled Area

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 5 

 BODY:
The rapper Tupac Shakur had a song "Death Around the Corner" that described the hell of living in a world of drugs and guns, a world that the Rev. Cornell Lewis and other North End residents here know all too well. 
 In their world, young girls like Takira Gaston, 7, who was shot in the face on July 4, get caught in drug dealers' cross-fire, and men like James Washington, 76, killed in January for the few dollars in his minimart cash register, die from bullet wounds instead of old age. 
 Why is not a mystery: the North End was home to 19 of the city's 27 homicides last year, many of them related to the daily narcotics trade that Mr. Lewis has watched for years on these bleak and boarded-up street corners. 
The difference now is, Mr. Lewis and some of his friends are watching through the lens of a video camera trained on the drug dealers and their customers.
"Death could come at any moment," Mr. Lewis said last week after two hours of drive-by videotaping, done from the passenger seat of a car driven around the North End by a friend. "Anytime you raise your voice against oppression, the oppressor will come after you. I just feel that some group has to do something more than complain and react. You have to expose the problem."
The problem is not new, and it has long held the attention of the Hartford Police Department, which keeps a steady presence in the North End. But as any resident or urban economist will tell you, the police -- especially Hartford's chronically understaffed and underfinanced police -- cannot stop as much as impede the drug-related crime that now appears to be on the upswing, contributing to a 27.5 percent increase in North End burglaries and four homicides so far this year. 
Mr. Lewis and his helpers at the Northend Church of Christ have been shooting their videos since late January. No one, including the dealers, who have threatened his life, disputes Mr. Lewis's guts. Whether his tapes will ever make a difference on the broken, barren streets here is far less certain. 
Driving past the corner of Brook and Mather Streets on a recent weekend, Mr. Lewis, who had replaced his preppy sweater vest and crimson beret with a hooded black sweatshirt in a church parking lot, makes eye contact with three men leaning on pay phones near a storefront. The man in the baseball cap, staring at the old Toyota, tips his bill once, twice, a plain invitation to Mr. Lewis and three white passengers -- presumed to be cruising the mostly black North End to buy drugs -- to make a deal. 
It would have made good video, except for the stares. "Keep rolling," Mr. Lewis told the driver, who did not want to be identified. "The brother on the right is watching us." 
A few blocks away, on Middlefield Street, a half block from where a sign nailed to a tree announces, "No Loitering -- Police Take Notice," two men are leaning into a car with two people in it. The driver and one of the men engage in an extra-long handshake. After ordering the Toyota to circle the block, Mr. Lewis has the driver stop and aims his palm-size camera at the scene, narrating as he records. "Now, you tell me that was just a handshake," he said later. 
Passing the Melo Mini Market, on Albany Avenue, the Toyota garners great interest from a man on the corner, who motions, then yells, for it to stop. Mr. Lewis nods vigorously to the man. "Keep going," he murmurs to his driver.
Not every young man on a street corner, of course, is peddling dope. But by recording what he calls "suspicious activity," mostly at the hands of young black men lingering near pay phones, bodega doorways or cars whose drivers curiously park in the middle of the street, the reverend wants to send a message to the dealers and the suburbanites who the police say make up about half of the dealers' clientele: No more Takira Gastons, not another James Washington. 
"This is an issue of life and death for our community," Mr. Lewis, 52, said as he prepared another video tour of the neighborhood last week. "They know they are not dealing with a turn-the-cheek, look-up-at-the-sky kind of preacher."
Mr. Lewis grew up in the 60's in Detroit's inner city, where, he said, the all-white police force would routinely round up young black men, him included, for "fingerprinting" at headquarters -- where everyone was lined up, punched and sent home. "I always ran to the front of the line, because they always saved the worst for last," he said. In 1967, when he was 17, he was convicted of larceny; he said he stole money to buy food and spent six months in a correctional center for young criminals. Angry at the white world around him, he traveled to California to meet Huey Newton and joined the Black Panthers. 
His passion eventually turned to spiritual matters, and in 1990 he received a bachelor of arts from Lincoln Christian College and Seminary in Illinois. Two years ago, he earned a master's degree in rehabilitation services from Springfield College in Springfield, Mass. Mr. Lewis's day job is as a drug and anger-management counselor at a local agency, Hartford Behavioral Health.
He says he is "a known quantity" to the North End dealers and gangbangers. They know where he lives, and, after Mr. Lewis beat up a mugger who he said was sent by the dealers, they probably know that the bald man with the bulging eyes and graying beard also holds a second-degree black belt in jujitsu. In 1994, after helping rid his Bellevue Street neighborhood of two local gangs, 20 Love and Los Solidos, Mr. Lewis found a dead squirrel hung by its neck over a telephone wire outside his stoop, as a warning. 
"Cornell is no stranger to the streets," said Hartford's recently elected mayor, Eddie Perez, who grew up on the same North End corners that Mr. Lewis now trains his video camera on.
Mr. Perez voiced concern for Mr. Lewis's safety but said if the videos prompt just one resident to clean up the yard or paint the house, it might start a trend. "The noise that's being made," Mr. Perez said, "is making the police and making me pay more attention to the problem."
Since the videos do not catch anyone obviously dealing drugs, said Lt. Neil Dryfe of the Hartford Police, there is not much his department can do. Asked last week if the civilian videos would help stop the dealing, Sgt. Malik Merritt, a 20-year Hartford Police veteran whose territory includes the North End, shrugged. "The same corners that were hot spots now," he said, "were hot spots when I was a rookie."
Last Friday evening, Sergeant Merritt was among the 25 people gathered at the Northend Church of Christ, where Mr. Lewis held a "world premiere" of his videos, which he edited down to nine minutes. 
"This videotape is the latest manifestation of the way we fight," he said, pushing the Play button. "We cannot depend only on the police." 
Afterward, some in the audience asked what they could do to help that fight. Others, like the church's pastor, James Lane, wondered aloud whether the shaky images of young black men on street corners would change anything. "We need help," Mr. Lane said with frustration. "I've done too many funerals for some of these kids. It's a hell of a business giving a funeral for a 14-year-old."

HEADLINE: County Chiefs Agree to Share Some Services And Clout 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., March 5 

 BODY:
Long Island's two counties, Nassau and Suffolk, have historically shared little but the boundary line that divides them. But now a political odd couple is teaming up to tackle regional issues in an uncharacteristic spirit of bicounty cooperation.
 "I'd like to introduce a special guest who's joined us here today," the Suffolk County executive, Robert J. Gaffney, a Republican, said today as he gave his annual state-of-the-county address in Hauppauge. 
 The surprise visitor was none other than the new county executive from adjacent Nassau, Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat. 
The unlikely Republican-Democrat duo plan to appear together again Wednesday at Hofstra University, to speak on Long Island's economy. Next week they will be off to Albany "to advance the Long Island agenda" in the Legislature, Mr. Gaffney said. Their next lobbying foray after that will be to Washington. 
"It will be the first time in history that the two county executives representing Long Island have joined forces this way," Mr. Gaffney said. "It should be an era of unprecedented regional cooperation. Together we represent more than 2.7 million people, a population larger than 19 states. So by the numbers, we'll have much more clout."
Does coming from rival parties hamper their partnership? "If anything, it helps in our mission," Mr. Suozzi said in an interview here. "We're more effective together. As a Republican, he can work one side of the aisle. As a Democrat, I can work the other."
To date, the two executives have sat down half a dozen times. "Tom and I have been meeting regularly," Mr. Gaffney said. "We've pledged to try to find ways to share the use of major facilities and services to hold down taxes. Frankly, we need to think outside the box to promote regional cooperation."
Getting down to specifics, Mr. Gaffney and Mr. Suozzi are forming a bicounty task force to look at ways of working together. For example, Suffolk has a new police academy, while Nassau is training its cadets in trailers. And Nassau has a juvenile detention center, while Suffolk needs one. Another idea is joint promotions of tourism on Long Island.
Their legislative goals are largely monetary, like getting adequate compensation for policing state roads, a fair share of 911 surcharges on cellphones and more aid for state-mandated programs, as well as amending the arbitration system for police unions.
"I think it's wonderful," said Dr. Lee E. Koppelman, a longtime proponent of bicounty cooperation and the executive director of a rare example of it, the Long Island Regional Planning Board, formed in 1965. "This can't be anything but good for the people of both counties. They're not competitive with each other. They don't have a Berlin Wall at the Nassau-Suffolk border."
Although Nassau and Suffolk have some similarities, the two counties are also distinctive. Nassau, adjacent to Queens, is more compact, densely developed, mature and affluent. Suffolk, extending nearly 90 miles out into the Atlantic Ocean, has more than three times as much land as Nassau and has surpassed it in population, 1.4 million to 1.3 million. 
Past efforts at cooperation often ran aground on political and personality differences, Dr. Koppelman said. But so far, the current county executives are getting along famously. After Mr. Suozzi's election victory in November, Mr. Gaffney made a congratulatory call and suggested exploring mutual issues. Mr. Suozzi said he had been thinking the same thing. "Instead of being competitors, we could be collaborators," Mr. Gaffney said today, "accomplishing together what we couldn't separately."
Their styles contrast, with the low-key Mr. Gaffney in his 11th year in office and nearly two decades older than Mr. Suozzi, the brash newcomer. "We're different people, and we get along very well -- and it helps that we don't have to run against each other," said Mr. Suozzi. And Mr. Gaffney said: "I like the guy. I like his enthusiasm and energy."
Already branching out beyond the fledgling Long Island coalition, Mr. Suozzi is playing host on Wednesday to the Democratic county executive of another major New York suburb, Andrew J. Spano of Westchester. They will be pushing for the cooperation of metropolitan governments, including New York City's, on dealing with terrorism and other emergencies.
Returning to his focus on his home region, Mr. Suozzi said: "Long Island is an island, and the artificial boundary that runs along the two counties shouldn't separate us as much as it has in the past."

FORMICA FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The Formica Corporation, which makes laminated countertops and flooring, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, citing the economic slowdown, a burdensome debt and interest expenses. 
The company, based in Warren, N.J., said that it had secured $78 million in credit to cover operating costs while it reorganized. The bankruptcy petition, which covers Formica and nine related businesses, was filed in Manhattan. "The restructuring will have no impact on our ability to fill our obligations to our employees or to our customers," Frank A. Riddick III, president and chief executive, said. The company, which is privately held, listed assets of $858.6 million and debt of $816.5 million.

Tourists and Islam Mingle, Not Always Cozily

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: ZANZIBAR, Tanzania 

 BODY:
Zanzibar has long wrestled with its dual role as both an Islamic society and a tourist spot, but lately a combination of bikinis, bombs and beer has made that balancing act tougher than ever. 
 This former sultanate with sand is more than 90 percent Muslim and has more than 50 mosques crowded together in the old quarter, called Stonetown, outnumbering its hotels and guesthouses. 
 Many tourists who roam Stonetown's labyrinthine alleyways dress in skimpy beach attire despite advice from tour operators to cover up. It is not difficult to see in close quarters both the bikini and the buibui, as the black head-to-toe covering that local women wear is called. 
"If I want to come to your home I should follow the rules of your home," said the imam of one mosque, Maalim Idris Saleh. "It should be the same for those visiting Zanzibar. We don't want people to kiss each other on the streets. We don't want them to walk around naked." 
The locals complain that living as a devout Muslim can be a challenge with tourists in one's midst. But the conflict has become more violent recently as a segment of Zanzibar's Muslim community pushes a hard-line religious view. 
A series of bombings at local bars, none regular tourist haunts, has tarnished the island's image as a tranquil vacation spot where the loudest sound one can expect to hear is ocean waves crashing against the pristine shore. 
In one, somebody stuck an explosive into a urinal in the men's room of the New Happy Lodge in the Stonetown area. Porcelain shards wounded the owner and blinded two others. Business has not been the same since. 
"Help the bomb victims," says a handwritten sign affixed to a collection box at the bar, where a crush of locals hang out all day drinking.
Similar explosions have rocked two other bars. A fourth tore through a vehicle that delivers alcohol. The police have arrested five suspects in the attacks and they say that the men may have heard anti-alcohol teachings in local mosques and taken the religious message to the extreme.
"Up to this moment we don't have direct evidence to link the terrorist activities with religious convictions but we suspect that to be the case," said Juma Mtumwa Abdallah, Zanzibar's assistant police commissioner. 
Such tensions are not exactly new. People from the Middle East, Asia and Europe have visited the Indian Ocean trading center for thousands of years. As far back as 1939, the government saw fit to limit the consumption of alcohol, prohibited under Islam, to "certain classes of persons, including Europeans, Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Parsee and Goans." 
Tourism nose-dived in 1998 after it was disclosed that one of the men involved in the terrorist bombing of the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam was from Pemba, the smaller of the two main islands that make up Zanzibar. Khalfan Khamis Muhammad, an operative working for Osama bin Laden, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for helping to make the explosives used to attack the embassy on Aug. 7, 1998.
Then, last year, the government of Tanzania began a violent crackdown in Zanzibar on members of the opposition Civic United Front who were protesting the results of disputed elections held in October 2000. The ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party, based on the mainland, has set up an independent commission to look into the dozens of killings and widespread allegations of abuse by government security forces.
The island's image did not improve after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, with reports that Islamic fundamentalists were distributing lists in some mosques seeking volunteers to aid Mr. bin Laden. 
The police began investigating all locals planning to travel overseas to ensure that none were headed for Afghanistan. No Al Qaeda recruits were discovered.
The war being waged on the streets of Zanzibar is clearly more a clash of cultures than an international battle over terrorism.
Mr. Saleh, the imam, said only a tiny number of the island's Islamic community could be considered radicals. A vast majority lamented the attacks on the United States, he said, and similarly did not support the smaller-scale violence to enforce the rules of Islam.
As for tourism, he said most Muslims embraced the economic support it brought to the island but questioned the costs on the culture. 
Occasionally, men have attacked local women for not wearing what they considered sufficiently modest clothing. Some religious activists have even called for the same treatment for tourists, but such a campaign has never taken root.
"See her? She's dressed O.K.," said a taxi driver hanging out with colleagues outside the main museum in Stonetown. He motioned toward an elderly woman in long pants and long sleeves. "That one's not O.K.," he said of a woman, a tourist, wearing a skirt that fell far above the knees.
He offered his most enthusiastic approval to a local woman, her age unclear, entirely covered in black. "That's how women should dress," he said.
The man cut his fashion critique short, however, because he had more pressing business -- a group of tourists, showing far too much skin, who needed ferrying around in his taxi.

HEADLINE: Nigerians To Withdraw From Accord With I.M.F. 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, March 5 

 BODY:
Nigeria said today that it was withdrawing from an informal monitoring arrangement with the International Monetary Fund and would aim instead for a home-grown economic program to better serve its people.
 A statement from the president's office said the government withdrew from the program "because it values the benefits of political stability, democratic constitution, credibility and accountability." 
 In a separate and more detailed statement, Finance Minister Adamu Ciroma said Nigeria "does not wish to continue with arrangements where only narrowly defined macro-economic considerations come into play." 
Economic analysts said President Olusegun Obasanjo's government had clearly opted in favor of political considerations, at least for now, as it heads for critical elections next year.
An endorsement of Nigeria's economic policies by the International Monetary Fund is critical, though, if Nigeria hopes to win relief on its foreign debt of about $30 billion.
A one-year standby accord between Nigeria and the I.M.F. expired by August of last year but the fund's board effectively approved a technical extension to October.
The extension allowed fund officials to evaluate the performance of the economy in the first half of the year and look at Nigeria's policies for the second half.
In that evaluation, the fund criticized the government for what it called excessive spending and sought deep cuts in the capital budget for 2002.
Parliament is still struggling to juggle priorities in the 2002 budget after a decrease of more than 40 percent in Nigeria's mainstay oil revenue after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.
At the same time, Mr. Obasanjo has faced attacks at home, even from members of his own party, over his government's inability to end economic stagnation and create jobs for the millions of unemployed.
Political analysts have cited unemployment as a major factor in spiraling political and religious violence that has killed well over 3,000 people since Mr. Obasanjo took office nearly three years ago.
There are growing signs that Mr. Obasanjo will seek re-election next year. 
Mr. Ciroma listed what he termed clear achievements in the period since Mr. Obasanjo took over an economy wrecked by 15 years of corrupt military rule -- a factor he implied the I.M.F. evaluation had ignored. "Between 2000 and 2001 real G.D.P. grew at a faster pace than at any time since 1991," he said.

HEADLINE: Border Agents on Lookout for Terrorists Are Finding Drugs 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: NOGALES, Ariz., March 4 

 BODY:
This was not Cuauchtemoc Garcia's luckiest day.
 As he drove his white Honda Civic into the United States border checkpoint here from Mexico, his engine overheated, sending up plumes of steam and catching the attention of customs agents who, to this point, had not suspected that he was much more than a man who did not take very good care of his car. 
 But as they talked to him and began asking questions, they decided, as they do in these post-Sept. 11 days, to run his name through a databank. That was where the bad luck came in. Mr. Garcia, 20, who lives here, was wanted in neighboring Pima County for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation, a misdemeanor. As he was escorted into a holding cell and placed in handcuffs, his car was the least of his worries. 
Mr. Garcia was hardly the most dangerous fugitive to pass through Nogales, one of the busiest checkpoints along the Mexican border, with more than 20,000 people a day traveling north by foot, car and truck. But he exemplified life at border checkpoints now that the United States is on a heightened security alert for terrorists and weapons, and checkpoints have more personnel and equipment than ever, with more help on the way from 1,600 National Guard troops.
Kevin Bell, a spokesman for the Customs Service, said the efforts had stopped "a number of people linked to terrorism" whom the F.B.I. and other federal agencies have interest in. But more often, he said, the added resources are helping catch other quarry, including fugitives like Mr. Garcia, illegal border crossers and, most of all, people transporting illegal drugs.
Here and elsewhere along a border of more than 1,900 miles from Brownsville, Tex., to San Ysidro, Calif., drug seizures have been soaring. Mr. Bell said the flow of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine seemed to slow for about a month after Sept. 11, but resumed at record levels.
"Drug traffickers can't sit on their loads forever," he said. "They're running a business. They have payrolls to meet."
It is not clear whether the seizure rates are climbing as a result of intensified efforts by federal agents, the economics of drug dealing, the brazenness of traffickers or a combination of factors. In any case, border crossings are no longer the wave-through they used to be, with a few simple questions and a quick visual check by an agent at a gatehouse or pedestrian checkpoint.
Now, drivers are routinely asked where they are from, where they are going and what is in their car, questions that can take a minute or two versus the 20 to 30 seconds they once took. Some drivers are asked to pop their hoods and open their trunks for further inspection, causing backups of 45 minutes or longer. Pedestrians also face more questions and are more likely to be patted down.
"We're doing more interviews, looking in more trunks and hoods, talking to more people," said Joe Lafata, the port director. "The whole process is taking longer, but it's much more thorough."
Inspectors have always had the discretion to pull a car out of line for a second, more complete inspection. That, too, has intensified. Agents are looking for drugs by tapping on door panels, peeking under carpets and opening boxes. Sometimes the agents use drug-sniffing dogs, and sometimes the names of the driver and passengers are checked for outstanding warrants, the case with Mr. Garcia.
Patti Valenzuela, 32, who works in a Mexican art store in Tucson, watched with a scowl as agents poked around inside her car. She said she had crossed the border about 20 times in the last three months, and this was the first time she was detained for a secondary search.
"It makes you feel safer," she said, a nod to the realities of terrorism. "But in a way, I feel bad. It makes me feel like I did something wrong."
Agents spent about 10 minutes with Ms. Valenzuela's car and found nothing unusual. But with increasing regularity, that is not always the case for other drivers. At the Nogales port of entry, which includes two crossing points for vehicles, two for pedestrians and one for a railroad line that now has a scanning device to X-ray every train car, drug seizures have set records for every month since October.
The total for that five-month period through February, 206 seizures, was a 121 percent increase over the 93 seizures in the same period a year earlier.
Nationally, seizure of illegal drugs at all 301 ports of entry -- airports and seaports as well as border checkpoints -- increased by 17.1 percent in the last three months of 2001 compared with the same period the year before, Customs Service figures show.
Here, it is not so much the rising numbers that agents say is surprising. It is the traffickers' creativity.
"We're seeing mothers, fathers, grandmothers, even kids coming over with drugs," said Patrick Christian, a customs agent. "It's hard to comprehend and a lot more rampant than we realized."
Other agents said they had found drugs in gas tanks, radiators, false floors, tires, door panels and, in the case of one recent female pedestrian, a specially made girdle that hid several pounds of methamphetamine.
The agents here have found no terrorists. But hardly a day goes by when they do not find drugs. 
"We are real cognizant of the fact we have to keep that weapon of mass destruction from coming in," said Mr. Lafata, the port director. "That's everybody's greatest fear. But we're real proud of the fact we're seizing so many drugs. It has been our anti-terrorism dividend."

HEADLINE: Profits Down, Executive Pay Falls as Well, Survey Shows 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
With corporate profits and many stock prices down, pay for the chief executives of large companies fell slightly last year, according to a survey released yesterday.
 On average, the chief executives of the companies surveyed received total compensation of $10.46 million in 2001, down 4 percent from 2000, as declines in bonuses and the value of stock option grants outweighed increases in salary and incentive payments other than stock options. The overall drop was the second in the survey's 18-year history and the first since 1993, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm in New York that conducted the study. 
 Even as the chiefs were taking small pay cuts, most other executives, whose compensation typically receives less scrutiny from investors and corporate watchdogs, received raises. Some of the increases were large. Chief financial officers on average received a 19 percent raise, to $3.3 million, and the average pay for the top information-technology executive within a company rose 17 percent, to $1.4 million. 
Of the 20 categories of executives that Pearl Meyer tracked, the average pay increased in 13.
The study is based on confidential survey responses last year from 50 companies, with average sales of $28 billion.
The decline in pay for chief executives puts an end, at least temporarily, to an enormous run-up that began more than 15 years ago. It has also raised hope among some analysts that the idea of pay for performance, long preached by corporate America but practiced in relatively few boardrooms, is becoming more of a reality.
Walt Disney, for example, did not give a bonus to its chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, last year because the company lost money. He received an $11.5 million bonus in 2000. Morgan Stanley gave its chief, Philip J. Purcell, total compensation of $12.8 million in cash and stock last year, down from $21.9 million in 2000. Eli Lilly reduced the bonus of its chief executive, Sidney Taurel, from $1.5 million in 2000 to less than $500,000 last year.
"This says the pay programs are working the way they're supposed to work," said Jan Koors, a vice president at Pearl Meyer. "When performance goes down, pay goes down."
Despite last year's decline, however, executive pay has risen much faster in recent years than measures of performance, and much faster than other employees' pay. Since 1985, when the chief executives made $1.08 million on average, their pay has increased 869 percent
Over the same span, the Standard & Poor 500-stock index rose about 450 percent. Weekly wages for workers paid by the hour rose 64 percent, according to the Department of Labor.
Last year, the pay categories that boards can directly control rose moderately, while the categories determined by profits and stock prices fell.
Base salaries for the chief executives increased 5 percent, to $1.19 million, on average. Long-term compensation -- which includes stock grants and cash awards based on profits or other measures -- rose 15 percent, to $1.5 million. This increase, Ms. Koors said, resulted from more companies giving such awards after their stock prices fell below the exercise price of many options.
Companies also continued to increase the number of options they gave to chief executives, but the slump in the stock market in 2000 and 2001 caused each option to lose value. Widely used formulas for estimating the value of options use the shares' value at the time of a grant as a central variable.
On average, the value of option grants fell 7 percent, to $6.02 million. Bonuses declined 12 percent, to $1.76 million.
Ms. Koors predicted that bonuses would fall again this year because they are often determined by profits in the prior year and profits fell for most companies in 2001.
"The last half of 2000 was not great," she said. "But 2001 was all bad."
Compensation consultants also say that the combination of a recession, a war and the collapse of Enron, where some executives made tens of millions of dollars while the company overstated profits, might be causing some executives to restrain their demands for new raises.
"People don't seem as aggressive in pushing things as far as they were," said David M. Leach, the director of the compensation practice at Buck Consultants in New York.
More detailed compensation statistics will be available in the coming weeks as companies send the Securities and Exchange Commission their annual proxy statements, which contain detailed pay information for the top five executives.

HEADLINE: Service Companies Show Growth at Strong Pace 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
The biggest part of the economy expanded in February at the fastest pace in 15 months, a closely watched industry survey showed today.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of service companies, builders and other nonmanufacturing companies rose more than expected after an unexpected retreat in January. That adds to reports of factory growth for the first time in 19 months, rising construction and increases in incomes and spending that indicate the economy is rebounding from recession. 
 "We were looking for a single, but we got a home run," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. The services index has risen to "the kind of level that we were seeing a couple of years ago when the economy was booming."
The index of nonmanufacturing business, which accounts for about 80 percent of the economy, rose to 58.7 in February from 49.6 in January. A reading above 50 signals expansion; the index has not been this high since November 2000. Analysts had expected it to rise to 51, according to the median of 36 forecasts calculated by Bloomberg News.
Orders at service companies also were the highest in 15 months, reflecting rising sales at retailers. Demand for goods at the retail level has already started to lift production at manufacturers, which reported expansion in February for the first time since July 2000.
The institute, based in Tempe, Ariz., was formerly the National Association of Purchasing Management. It gathers statistics from more than 370 purchasing executives in more than 62 industries, including legal, medical, government and retailing.
A separate report today showed that the number of job cuts planned by American employers dropped in February to the lowest level in eight months. Businesses announced plans to eliminate 128,155 positions, down 40 percent from a month earlier, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a job placement firm. The decrease was the fourth in the last five months.

HEADLINE: A Better Deal for Victims 

 BODY:
The proposed rules governing the federal compensation fund for families of the victims of Sept. 11 have been revised and improved, but need some additional refinement before they are adopted later this week. Attorney General John Ashcroft, in particular, can help by ensuring that the fund is fully accessible to the families of illegal aliens who lost their lives in the terror attacks.
 Kenneth Feinberg, the fund's special master, has used his time wisely in recent weeks to conduct exhaustive hearings with victims' families, many of which had complained about the preliminary regulations issued last December. The net effect of the adjustments he has made will be to boost the payout for many families, give families more timely information about their financial prospects and ease the rules governing people who were injured. 
 Congress established the program last September as part of emergency legislation to bail out the airline industry. Those who file claims with the fund are guaranteed payment for their economic and non-economic losses within 120 days. They must, however, waive their right to sue the airlines. There has been controversy from the beginning, mainly over the size of Mr. Feinberg's proposed awards for non-economic damages. As of March 1, only about 350 of a possible 3,000 or so families had applied to the fund for assistance. Nevertheless, the fund has always struck us as an attractive and secure alternative to litigation, and still does. 
One further change is necessary. As of yesterday, Mr. Feinberg had not won agreement from the Justice Department to shield from prosecution the families and the employers of illegal aliens killed on Sept. 11. Nobody knows how many illegal aliens there were, in part because their relatives and bosses have been reluctant to step forward. Eliot Spitzer, New York State's attorney general, agreed early on not to pursue undocumented aliens who receive charity from the private funds set up to help victims' families. Mr. Ashcroft should make similar guarantees to Mr. Feinberg regarding the federal fund. 
Financially, the most important change in the original rules would increase the awards for non-economic damages. Unless there is a last-minute change, the basic award for a victim's pain and suffering will stay at $250,000, despite complaints that this figure is too low. But Mr. Feinberg has agreed to double awards for spouses and children, from $50,000 to $100,000 each. Meanwhile, the awards for economic losses, based largely on anticipated earnings over the remainder of the victim's career, will stay roughly the same.
Mr. Feinberg has tried to ease the impact of so-called "collateral offsets" -- various deductions like Social Security and workmen's compensation that Congress required him to make in computing the final awards. And he has wisely agreed to codify an earlier promise to provide nearly everyone a minimum of $250,000. Under the earlier rules, some families with large insurance policies or large pension benefits could have netted zero when these offsets were deducted from the awards. 
One of the most useful changes has more to do with communication than money. Once people sign on to the program, they cannot back out. But the revised regulations will allow them to get a "ballpark" estimate of their eventual award from Mr. Feinberg's staff, thus permitting a reasoned judgment as to whether they should join the program or take their chances in court. Mr. Feinberg clearly thinks they will be better off with him. Some of the country's most aggressive plaintiff's lawyers agree. Since Congress has capped the liability of the airlines and other potential defendants, there are no real deep pockets left.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Will Face Blunt Terms In Weapons Talks at the U.N. 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 5 

 BODY:
After three years of refusing to deal with United Nations arms inspectors, a high-level Iraqi delegation is about to come face to face for the first time with the leader of the inspection commission, Hans Blix. 
 That the Iraqis have agreed to this meeting, set for Thursday, after asking to see only Secretary General Kofi Annan, is indicative of the concern they have that the threat of an American attack is real, if not imminent, diplomats and United Nations officials said in interviews this week. 
 While no one expects a quick resumption of arms inspections in Iraq, diplomats said the Iraqis appear more conciliatory. They also said the five permanent Security Council members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- are more unified than in recent years at least on the demand that until inspectors return on the Council's terms, no relief from sanctions can be permitted. 
Dr. Blix, a Swedish disarmament expert and international lawyer, said in an interview on Monday that the Council's terms meant unrestricted access and no Iraqi veto over the nationality of inspectors. "I am not giving any discounts on Security Council resolutions," he said. "There are no sanctuaries. The resolutions make it quite clear that there should be access that is unconditional, immediate and unrestricted." 
The Iraqis sought this week's meeting after a year of cold-shouldering the United Nations and another two years of playing Council members off one another. When Mr. Annan agreed to the talks, he decided to include Dr. Blix, executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, created in December 1999 to replace an earlier body, the United Nations Special Commission. A senior United Nations legal counsel will also be present.
The Iraqi delegation to what is expected to be only the first round of talks will be led by a new foreign minister, Naji Sabri, who is considered more amenable than his blustering predecessor, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf. 
Weapons experts will be included in the Iraqi group, the first to venture out on this issue since a reshuffle in the Iraqi foreign affairs hierarchy that may have reduced the influence of Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, diplomats said. Mr. Aziz recently visited Moscow and Beijing but received little in the way of support from the Russians or Chinese for continued defiance of the Security Council.
At the International Peace Academy, a research organization in New York that works closely with the United Nations, David Malone, the organization's president, said American threats to hit Iraq may have influenced thinking in countries like Russia and France, which have large commercial interests there. If the government of Iraq were to be dislodged or toppled by United States action, what would happen to those interests -- to the debt of up to $8 billion Iraq owes the Russians? 
"Saddam Hussein may have played his cards wrong," Mr. Malone, a Canadian diplomat, said in an interview. "Overall, patience with Iraq has pretty much run out."
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, said today that Iraq's team looked promising.
"The fact that they are coming with a senior and quite serious delegation is a good sign that they want to have discussions with the secretary general about -- as they would see it -- the options open to them," he said. "As the Security Council, and I'm sure the secretary general, see it, the options open to them are compliance."
Britain and other Security Council members have met with Mr. Annan to encourage him not to allow the Iraqis to shift talks away from their immediate obligations. Iraq, seeking control over revenue from oil sales, wants a timetable for the lifting of penalties. Money now goes into escrow accounts, with some earmarked to assist the Kurds in northern Iraq, to pay reparations for the 1990 occupation of Kuwait and to support arms inspection.
Dr. Blix has used some of that money to turn the commission he has headed since early 2000 into a much more technically professional body than its predecessor. A vast data base with sophisticated search engines for cross-referencing archival material on Iraq has been created, he said. 
Satellite imagery of Iraqi buildings, roads, power lines or other objects of interest to inspectors has been purchased from commercial suppliers. A blowup of the streets of Baghdad hangs on his office wall.
About 230 inspectors from dozens of countries have been trained or are now in training to work in Iraq, Dr. Blix said.
The Monterey Institute of International Studies in California has produced a media file of 3,000 to 4,000 articles or other material published on Iraqi weapons, including testimony from defectors and intelligence leaks. Technology has been upgraded. "They have acquainted themselves with a lot of new techniques," Dr. Blix said of his inspectors. "Sensors, tagging, cameras, etc. -- all this moves very fast."
The question hanging over the United Nations now is whether the United States really wants arms inspectors to return, based on public comments made by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld questioning their value. Some diplomats say the United States would not want inspectors on the ground if a military attack were being planned; the last inspectors to work in Iraq had to be pulled out ahead of American bombing in 1998.
Other diplomats say they think that Washington fears that inspectors could be used to give the appearance of Iraqi compliance while continuing to stonewall inspectors and hide weapons programs. Publicly, however, Bush administration officials call for the return of inspectors in line with Security Council demands.
As the Council approaches several critical months of work on the Iraq issue, European diplomats see the most unity on an agreement on a new list of what Iraq can buy freely with its oil money and of which items will be open to scrutiny because they look like civilian goods but could have military uses. That agreement is expected to be completed by mid-May.

HEADLINE: Bloomingdale's Considers Opening a SoHo Branch 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Bloomingdale's is seeking city and state tax relief and other incentives to open a store in a historic building in SoHo, state and city officials said yesterday. It would be the first branch in Manhattan for the retailer, whose flagship store is on the Upper East Side, and the only major department store to have a presence below 14th Street.
 Federated Department Stores, the parent company of Bloomingdale's, recently signed a nonbinding agreement known as a letter of intent to lease an 1860 cast-iron-and-stone building on Broadway between Spring and Broome Streets that currently houses the Canal Jean Company, which is searching for a new location downtown after 40 years. 
 The 100,000-square-foot building, at 504 Broadway, which is known for the candle-shaped columns that adorn its facade, is a few blocks north of Canal Street, the northern boundary for what officials are calling the Liberty Zone, the area most affected by the terrorist attack of Sept. 11. The bulk of the government assistance is limited to businesses below Canal Street. 
But the proposed new Bloomingdale's does fall within the boundaries of the so-called Resurgence Zone, between Canal and Houston Streets -- an area where many merchants have been struggling in the wake of the disaster, particularly because of the decline in international tourism.
Federated is expected to argue that a full cornucopia of incentives is justified because a Bloomingdale's in SoHo would stimulate retail activity not only in the immediate vicinity but also farther south.
Michael Gould, the chief executive of Bloomingdale's, did not respond to a request for comment. Canal Jean Company officials referred questions to their financial consultant, Robert L. Pressman, the managing partner of Newmark Retail Financial Advisors, who also refused to discuss Bloomingdale's plans.
But city officials confirmed that the Economic Development Corporation is reviewing a proposal from Federated about the SoHo site. State officials said they have asked the company to show that the neighborhood supports the planned store.
Kevin Corbett, the chief operating officer of the Empire State Development Corporation, said the state would consider granting some incentives to Bloomingdale's.
"Certainly we're interested in supporting amenities that improve the desirability of Lower Manhattan," Mr. Corbett said, "and we're willing to talk to them and other any other parties interested in making investments there."
In branching out in SoHo, Bloomingdale's would not seek to duplicate its flagship store at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue, which has about 550,000 square feet of retail space and carries furniture and housewares in addition to clothing. Instead, the store would seek to appeal to younger consumers and tourists by carrying fashionable apparel and accessories, according to retail experts familiar with the proposal.
Wendy Liebmann, a retail consultant who was unaware of Bloomingdale's proposal, said that department stores have been having a hard time attracting young customers. A specialty store in SoHo would be an attempt to accommodate the preferences of these sought-after consumers, she said.
"It's a stunning idea," said Ms. Liebmann, the president of WSL Strategic Retail. "They could be saying, 'We recognize that we're not doing as well in a traditional department store environment, so now we'll try to do it in a focused specialty department store for younger consumers.' It's very bold to be doing that, but it's that kind of boldness that department stores need today."
Another retail consultant who had not heard of the proposed store, Walter K. Levy, a managing director for retail trends and positioning of Kurt Salmon & Associates, said that it was not surprising that Bloomingdale's would be interested in SoHo. For the past several years, many midtown luxury retailers -- from Louis Vuitton to Prada to Chanel -- have opened outposts in SoHo, often occupying buildings that once housed art galleries, and Barneys recently announced plans to open a 7,000-square-foot store at 116 Wooster Street. Mr. Levy said that when foreign visitors return, many will be more likely to shop in SoHo than in Midtown.
"Clearly, what is happening is that the center of gravity of retail is no longer Midtown," Mr. Levy said. "Bloomingdale's is an important retail leader. A lot of overseas visitors want to go there. If that's where a lot go, then Bloomingdale's should be there."

HEADLINE: Worst Job Loss For New York In a Decade 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton LP>New York City lost far more jobs last year than anyone (except maybe the unemployed) realized: almost 36,000 more than the state's original estimate of 96,500, according to a new tally released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor.The new data, which have been revised to reflect information from corporate unemployment tax filings, show that the city lost 132,400 jobs last year, up by one-third from the Labor Department's original estimate. The drop is the steepest since 1991, which was the worst year of the recession that lasted from 1989 through 1992.

HEADLINE: BUSH PUTS TARIFFS OF AS MUCH AS 30% ON STEEL IMPORTS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
President Bush took some of the broadest federal action in two decades to protect a major American industry today, imposing tariffs of up to 30 percent on most types of steel imported into the United States from Europe, Asia and South America. The tariffs will last three years, he said, to give American steel producers time to consolidate operations and stem layoffs.
 Mr. Bush's action is likely to send the price of steel up sharply, perhaps as much as 10 percent, a cost American consumers will ultimately bear in higher prices for autos, appliances and housing. The United States imports about a quarter of the steel it consumes, though Mr. Bush exempted steel made in Mexico, Canada and developing nations from the tariffs announced today. The nations hardest hit are Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Germany and Brazil. 
 Within minutes of the White House announcement, America's European allies and Japan said they would almost certainly challenge the action before the World Trade Organization, setting the stage for a major trade fight with many of the same countries Mr. Bush is trying to hold together in the fractious coalition against terrorism. 
Their legal case, which could take years to litigate in Geneva, is likely to hinge on the fact that the "import surge" Mr. Bush declared as the justification for his action ended in 1998. Since then, foreign imports of steel to the United States have declined 27.5 percent, but the price of steel has also fallen sharply because of the simultaneous recessions in the United States and Japan, and a slowdown in Europe.
Mr. Bush defended his move in an appearance tonight with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. "We're a free-trading nation, and in order to remain a free-trading nation, we must enforce law," he said. "And that's exactly what I did. I decided that imports were severely affecting our industry, an important industry, in a negative impact, and, therefore, provide temporary relief so that the industry could restructure itself." News analysis, Page C1. 
But as indicated by the heated debates that have taken place inside the White House, the decision was hardly as easy as Mr. Bush made it sound today.
There were strategic considerations: Mr. Bush's national security aides are concerned that relations with Europe and Asia have already been strained by Mr. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto protocol on global warming; his withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia; and his description of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil." But in the end he decided that further damage to those ties was outweighed by the scope of the crisis in the steel industry. 
Mr. Bush's aides said the president hoped to create "breathing space" for the industry to overhaul itself, and to force Europe and Asia to shut down excess producing capacity rather than putting the brunt of the plant closings on the United States. Critics of the approach said, however, that the industry had resisted change for decades and they doubted that these tariffs would raise prices enough for the sickest firms to stave off bankruptcy.
The White House plan takes no action on a bailout of up to $12 billion to cover pension and health care costs for retired workers from bankrupt companies, an issue that now moves to Congress.
The Emergency Committee for American Trade, a group representing companies that buy steel, warned this afternoon that Mr. Bush had done more harm than good to the American economy.
"A 30 percent tariff won't solve the integrated steel industry's problems, but it will force other American manufacturers to move steel-intensive production overseas, close U.S. plants, and outsource U.S. parts and components in order to compete," it said in a statement. 
But the steel industry and unions representing steel workers, who had called for even higher tariffs, said they were largely satisfied with the president's action. "This is protection in substance as well as appearance," Robert S. Miller, the chief executive of Bethlehem Steel, said in a telephone interview this afternoon. Bethlehem filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 24, and is seeking a number of joint venture partners to keep its steel production plants open. 
While Mr. Bush has never discussed the subject in political terms since becoming president, he must have been mindful of political commitments made during the 2000 presidential campaign, when he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, accused President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore of failing to protect workers from low-priced imports. 
Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, sat in on the major meetings at the White House about how to deal with the steel industry's demands, and Mr. Rove met with leaders of the steel workers' unions. While officials said he never said so in the meetings, Mr. Rove and others in the White House know that the tariffs will have the greatest effects on steel producers in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, all critical in the coming Congressional elections.
One of the big winners today was Weirton Steel of West Virginia. Weirton officials praised Mr. Bush for putting 30 percent tariffs on tin sheet, one of its biggest products. The loser was South Korea, the largest exporter of the same type of steel.
While economists can make general estimates about how the increase in tariffs will translate into higher prices for consumer goods, figuring out the real cost increase for, say, an individual automobile model is next to impossible. Car makers will scramble in the next few months to get their supplies from countries exempt from the tariffs. 
Manufacturers may move some production to Canada or Mexico, so that the steel they buy is not subject to tariffs. And because steel prices have been rising in recent months without the tariffs, it will be difficult for Mr. Bush's opponents to blame him for the increase in the price of a specific minivan, for example.
Democrats today blamed Mr. Bush for doing too little, rather than too much. "Last week the steel companies and the steel worker unions agreed that 40 percent was the minimum average tariff needed to stabilize the industry," Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader, said in a statement today. He said he was "disappointed" that the tariffs average less than 30 percent.
He also noted that Mr. Bush "did nothing" to help with the pensions and health care costs of retirees. But the White House said that action was up to Congress, and not within the president's powers.
Mr. Bush is an avowed free trader, and many members of his team -- including Lawrence Lindsey, who runs the National Economic Council, and Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the council of economic advisers -- warned of the risks to both his free-trade credentials and the broader economy. In the past his trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, has compared raising tariffs to raising taxes, and while White House officials sidestepped such comparisons today they admitted that the result would be greater costs to consumers.
Mr. Bush's decision was the biggest action to preserve an ailing American industry since Ronald Reagan forced several nations into "voluntary" restraints on their steel and auto exports in the mid-1980's. Those agreements are now illegal under W.T.O. rules. So this time Mr. Bush chose another route, invoking a provision that allows a temporary tariff "safeguard" for three years. 
While the White House made no mention of it, the order Mr. Bush signed actually imposes the highest tariffs only for one year; on flat rolled steel, for example, the 30 percent tariff goes into effect within 15 days, but drops to 24 percent next year, and 18 percent in 2004.
It has other holes that importing nations will seek to exploit. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans -- Mr. Bush's former campaign chairman and a proponent of the tariff action -- said today that 80 developing nations would be exempted. Over the weekend, the chief executive of U.S. Steel, Thomas J. Usher, warned that many countries, particularly in Asia, would ship their steel to developing countries, relabel it, and send it on to the United States.
Mr. Bush also put the lowest tariffs on slab steel, an unfinished form of steel that is often used by smaller steel manufacturers to make their products. Mr. Bush's program will allow tariff-free imports of 5.4 million short tons, about equal to the imports in 2000, excluding slab steel from Canada and Mexico. That will be a boon to Russia, one of the largest producers of slab steel.

HEADLINE: The Dude In the Python 

BYLINE:  By Maureen Dowd 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I was the worst show in "Nightline" history.
 I went on the venerated news program in 1989 after the first President Bush's first State of the Union address, and somehow managed to bore Ted Koppel silly. 
 "Come back," he said drily, at the end of the show, "but not too soon."
When Mr. Koppel and Kyle Gibson did a book chronicling 16 years of "Nightline" a few years back, I was featured in a chapter called "Shows We Wish You Had Never Seen." 
Now you might think this traumatic experience would sour me on Ted Koppel, and leave me rooting for David Letterman.
But it isn't so.
I love Ted and his show. And I also love Dave and his show. One is serious and one is funny. But beyond that, the two men are a lot alike: topical, smart, sophisticated, politically savvy originals who have produced decades of amazing television.
Mr. Letterman felt he was being taken for granted by CBS, so he flirted with ABC, which led Mr. Koppel to feel he was being taken for granted.
But this whole mishegoss at ABC has led me to realize how much I'm being taken for granted.
When baby boomers were coming of age, everyone said that because we were such an outsized cohort, society would always cater to us and shape itself around us. We would be "the pig in the python," indulged and spoiled. 
But now, even though we have the most economic clout, the culture is no longer pitched to us. It is pitched to teenage boys.
Boomers may be the pig, but dudes control the bacon.
The executives in Hollywood who decide what to put on big screens and small are in the grip of an obsession with callow youth worthy of Oscar Wilde. In a breathless quest for teens and the 18-to-34 set, they have become the spendthrifts of their own mediocrity. 
Michael Eisner and Robert Iger, head Mouseketeers, think Mr. Letterman would be more valuable than Mr. Koppel because the comedian appeals to a younger demographic.
"The average age of 'Nightline' viewers is 50, the Letterman average about 46," The Washington Post noted. "But that gap can translate into millions of dollars in greater revenue from advertisers who prize a younger audience."
So this whole contretemps rests on a difference of four years?
Weirdly, the success of a show, and the amount of money it makes, is determined more by the age of its viewers than its ratings.
Media buyers and advertisers think younger viewers are more valuable not because they spend more money -- no one spends more dough more frivolously than boomers -- but because they are more elusive. 
Even though young women are a bigger market, young men are at a higher premium because they're tougher to lure to shows.
The hard business decisions of media companies, it turns out, are made with the fuzzy logic of romance: You'll only be complete if you can win over the object of affection that seems out of your reach.
"It's more based on myth than truth," conceded one network executive. "It might have been true in the 60's and 70's, but it has become an increasingly misguided assumption." 
Our whole culture is built on a marketing sand castle.
Advertisers, as Fred Brock wrote in The Times, have become "a bunch of anti-Willie Suttons, aiming where the money increasingly isn't."
Advertisers base the youth chase on antiquated notions from 30 years ago when older meant more mature. With fickle, prodigal boomers, a group obsessed with staying young, age does not necessarily bring thriftiness or habitualness.
Advertisers are still going by that old saw that they need to hook people at a tender age, before they get set in their buying habits and develop an allegiance to one brand. It ignores the fact that we have become a clicker society with a short attention span. 
Boomers switch brands constantly, moving from this anti-depressant to that, this age-defying face cream to that, this boutique wine to that.
Studies show that young adults have more brand loyalty now than restless middle-aged customers.
Maybe advertisers and TV suits know they're operating on archaic premises and skew ridiculously young because they're striving to be hip. Or maybe they're just, as David Letterman might say, colossal boobs.

HEADLINE: The Core Of Muslim Rage 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The latest death toll in the Indian violence between Hindus and Muslims is 544 people, many of them Muslims. Why is it that when Hindus kill hundreds of Muslims it elicits an emotionally muted headline in the Arab media, but when Israel kills a dozen Muslims, in a war in which Muslims are also killing Jews, it inflames the entire Muslim world?
 I raise this point not to make some idiot press critique or engage in cheap Arab-bashing. This is a serious issue. In recent weeks, whenever Arab Muslims told me of their pain at seeing Palestinians brutalized by Israelis on their TV screens every night, I asked back: Why are you so pained about Israelis brutalizing Palestinians, but don't say a word about the brutality with which Saddam Hussein has snuffed out two generations of Iraqis using murder, fear and poison gas? I got no good answers. 
 Because the real answer is rooted in something very deep. It has to do with the contrast between Islam's self-perception as the most ideal and complete expression of the three great monotheistic religions -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- and the conditions of poverty, repression and underdevelopment in which most Muslims live today. 
As a U.S. diplomat in the Middle East said to me, Israel -- not Iraq, not India -- is "a constant reminder to Muslims of their own powerlessness." How could a tiny Jewish state amass so much military and economic power if the Islamic way of life -- not Christianity or Judaism -- is God's most ideal religious path?
When Hindus kill Muslims it's not a story, because there are a billion Hindus and they aren't part of the Muslim narrative. When Saddam murders his own people it's not a story, because it's in the Arab-Muslim family. But when a small band of Israeli Jews kills Muslims it sparks rage -- a rage that must come from Muslims having to confront the gap between their self-perception as Muslims and the reality of the Muslim world.
I have long believed that it is this poverty of dignity, not a poverty of money, that is behind a lot of Muslim rage today and the reason this rage is sharpest among educated, but frustrated, Muslim youth. It is they who perpetrated 9/11 and who slit the throat of the Wall Street Journal reporter Danny Pearl -- after reportedly forcing him to declare on film, "I am a Jew and my mother is a Jew."
This is not to say that U.S. policy is blameless. We do bad things sometimes. But why is it that only Muslims react to our bad policies with suicidal terrorism, not Mexicans or Chinese? Is it because Arab-Muslim conspiracy theories state that Jews could not be so strong on their own -- therefore the only reason Israel could be strong, and Muslims weak, is because the U.S. created and supports Israel?
The Muslim world needs to take an honest look at this rage. Look what it has done to Palestinian society -- where the flower of Palestinian youth now celebrate suicide against Jews as a source of dignity. That is so bad. Yes, there is an Israeli occupation, and that occupation has been hugely distorting of Palestinian life. But the fact is this: If Palestinians had said, "We are going to oppose the Israeli occupation, with nonviolent resistance, as if we had no other options, and we are going to build a Palestinian society, schools and economy, as if we had no occupation" -- they would have had a quality state a long time ago. Instead they have let the occupation define their whole movement and become Yasir Arafat's excuse for not building jobs and democracy. 
Only Muslims can heal their own rage. But the West, and particularly the Jewish world, should help. Because this rage poses an existential threat to Israel. Three broad trends are now converging: (1) The worst killing ever between Israelis and Palestinians; (2) a baby boom in the Arab-Muslim world, where about half the population is under 20; (3) an explosion of Arab satellite TV and Internet, which are taking the horrific images from the intifada and beaming them directly to the new Arab-Muslim generation. If 100 million Arab-Muslims are brought up with these images, Israel won't survive.
Some of this hatred will remain no matter what Israel does. But to think that Israel's exiting the occupied territories -- and abandoning its insane settlement land grab there -- wouldn't reduce this problem is absurd. 
Israel cannot do it alone. But it has to do all it can to get this show off the air. It would take away an important card from the worst Muslim anti-Semites and it would help strengthen those Muslims, and there are many of them, who know that the suicidal rage of their fanatics is dragging down their whole civilization.

HEADLINE: Steel Tariffs Weaken Bush's Global Hand 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
In imposing tariffs today on much of the steel imported into the United States, President Bush was gambling that he could help domestic steel makers without endangering the economic recovery.
 He was betting that he could increase his chances of winning trade negotiating authority from Congress without poisoning economic relations with much of the rest of the world while he is courting international support for his war on terrorism. 
 And he was hoping to bolster his own re-election prospects in battleground states without being seen as abandoning his free trade, antitax philosophy.
The tariff schedule that he unveiled today was as close to a down-the-middle compromise as possible. But deftness in splitting the difference on an issue with all the economic and political complexity of this one provided no assurance that Mr. Bush, in the long run, will gain the outcome he wants on any level. 
"It's unclear whether they've moved two steps forward and one back, or the reverse," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The administration portrayed its decision as an effort to give companies in a vital industry a few years to recover and thereby help the people who depend on them and the economy as a whole.
Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said the plan would give the industry an opportunity to get back on its feet "without any significant effect on the economic recovery and growth."
Industries that are big users of steel, however, said the tariffs were in essence taxes on their raw materials that would increase their costs and the prices paid by consumers for cars, appliances and other goods, slowing the recovery from the recession.
Robert W. Crandall, an economist at the Brookings Institution who has studied the issue for a coalition of steel-using industries, called Mr. Bush's plan "a damaging economic blow that could delay the U.S. economy's recovery by increasing the cost of steel-made products like automobiles, cutting the demand for them and setting a dangerous precedent that could cause tens of thousands of layoffs in steel-using firms."
Even as he was trying to buy time for steel makers, Mr. Bush was also effectively trying to corral votes in the House and the Senate for approval of trade promotion authority, which would give him wide latitude to negotiate trade deals. 
Obtaining such authority would be vital to Mr. Bush's hopes of negotiating a trade deal with South American nations much like the Nafta agreement with Mexico and Canada. The legislation faces close votes this year in both the Senate, which is likely to take it up soon, and the House, which narrowly passed the measure late last year and will have to take it up again after the Senate acts.
Analysts said that by acting to protect the steel companies, the administration might have provided political cover to a handful of members of Congress who might otherwise have felt obliged to vote against giving the president negotiating authority.
Mr. Zoellick said the administration had not struck any deals for votes on the issue. But critics of the administration's tariff plan -- especially conservatives who said they were uncomfortable with Mr. Bush's wobbling commitment to free trade -- said the real problem was that even if the measure passed, the United States had now ceded the high ground in any trade talks that did take place.
"You're not guaranteed to get trade promotion authority by what they've done here," said Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and commentator. "The other thing is, you've undermined your ability to get something useful out of it anyway if you've lost your virginity, so to speak, by appearing to cave in to domestic protectionist pressures."
After noisy, emotional starts, trade fights have a way of being quietly settled over many years of patient negotiations. But at a time when the United States is working hard to maintain international cohesion in the fight against terrorism, any fraying of ties could create problems far broader than differences over hot-rolled steel sheet.
There is no question that the administration's plan was drawn with a sharp eye on domestic politics. Weirton Steel in West Virginia -- a traditionally Democratic state that Mr. Bush wrested into his column in 2000 in part by promising help to steel workers -- would benefit from a tariff that starts at 30 percent on one of its main products, known as tin mill.
But many Democrats assailed the administration for not doing more. Ed O'Brien, a steel union official who is the Democratic candidate for a Congressional seat that includes Allentown, Pa., said the president's plan "sends a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is really afraid to stand up and defend its industries, and that we can be bullied."
Moreover, some of the harshest criticism of Mr. Bush's plan came from his own ideological home on the right, where his action was widely seen as a triumph of political opportunism over principle. Only a few weeks ago, Mr. Zoellick stated flatly that tariffs "are nothing more than taxes that hurt low- and moderate-income people," a position he had trouble squaring with today's action.
Gerald O'Driscoll, director of the center for international trade and economics at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative research organization, said: "Sometimes politics dominates good economic decision-making in the best of administrations. This is purely a political decision. There is no economic justification for it."

Disney Woes Force Leader To Confront Hard Questions

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 5 

 BODY:
In Hollywood, there are few media figures as respected, feared and envied as Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company. But the imbroglio over Disney's move to woo David Letterman to ABC has put a spotlight on what a tough spot he is in these days.
 It is a sharp turn of events for the man who took over the top job at the company 18 years ago, dusted off a fading brand and turned Disney into one of the world's most respected names and himself into a Wall Street star. 
 But the numbers are sobering. The entertainment division, which oversees the ABC network, has been a revolving door for talent, with four top executives leaving in five years. Disney just named the third chief of its film studio in less than three years. ABC, the network Disney bought in 1996, has sunk to fourth place in the ratings among the four major networks. And for five years, Disney's stock price has languished behind three of the market's main indices, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the embattled Nasdaq. 
Against this backdrop, Disney's bold move to get Mr. Letterman away from CBS to replace Ted Koppel's "Nightline" makes sense. If successful, it could create new momentum for Mr. Eisner and send the right signals of toughmindedness to Wall Street. But whatever the outcome, the episode will leave a team of bruised egos inside ABC News, as well as questions about Mr. Eisner's handling of talent.
Both Mr. Eisner and the Disney president, Robert A. Iger, declined to comment on the company's fortunes this week. But both executives have said in recent interviews that turning around ABC was their No. 1 priority and that Mr. Iger was personally overseeing changes at the network.
This is not the first time Mr. Eisner's leadership has been tested. In the early 1990's, Disney was chastised for everything from political infighting to bad movie making. But now Mr. Eisner's style has left many questioning whether or how quickly he can revive Disney's fortunes. In trying to fix problems at the ABC network, Disney executives have unknowingly, or not, continued to alienate talent -- like Regis Philbin, Barbara Walters and Mr. Koppel.
Tom Wolzien, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York, said of the Letterman bid, "This is all typical of a network trying to dig itself out of a bottom." But, he added, the ABC network is only one problem Disney has to resolve to get back on track. "They are trying to find their way in a number of areas," he said.
Some of Disney's recent problems are not its own making. The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 caused a sharp decline in its theme parks business, particularly among foreign travelers who feared getting on airplanes. Only recently has Disney expressed cautious optimism that vacationers were coming back to the parks. The sluggish advertising market, which affected all media companies, has hurt Disney, too. Analysts say that when the economy turns bullish again, these divisions should benefit.
But last week a Goldman, Sachs analyst, Richard Greenfield, said the company's second-quarter earnings could fall short of Wall Street's consensus estimates. To right the ship, Disney has been making changes. In the live-action film unit, Disney insiders say the company is likely to take fewer chances on eclectic big budget movies like "The Insider," which lost money, and instead focus on lower-budget family fare, like the recent "Snow Dogs," which has already earned $75 million at the box office.
But the real work needs to be done at the network. The complaints about ABC's ratings are not new and have persisted since Disney merged with Capital Cities/ABC Inc. in the mid-1990's. In 1997, Fortune magazine wrote an article about Mr. Iger, then ABC's president who is now president of Disney, asking in a headline, "Can He Save ABC?" A year later Business Week wrote, "What ABC Needs Is Home Improvement."
One Disney executive, who insisted on not being identified, said executives there had not considered going after Mr. Letterman. But they were offered the chance after CBS failed to re-sign him quickly. Mr. Eisner and Mr. Iger are aware that rebuilding the network's prime-time schedule is a long-term proposition, the executive said. Getting Mr. Letterman would give the network a late-night boost.
Plus, there was another potential benefit to getting Mr. Letterman on the team: the news would bolster Disney's stock price as evidenced by the $1.04 jump from $23, after discussions became public.
What the two did not expect is that details about the negotiations would find their way into the media. Mr. Eisner and his top executives have been criticized for micromanaging, causing angst among both talent and staff members. Last year, Ms. Walters was upset when the network decided to move "20/20" temporarily from its Friday night spot and replace it with the critically acclaimed drama "Once and Again." Mr. Philbin, the host of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," was unhappy last fall when an ABC executive, before informing him, told the media that the show might not survive past the current season. (In fact, Mr. Philbin complained to Mr. Letterman about it one night on "Late Show.")
And Mr. Eisner offended some ABC workers when he was quoted as saying in Fortune magazine last fall that if he spent a couple of hours a day at ABC, he could make it the No. 1 network in two years.
Some people think Mr. Eisner is too harshly criticized for advancing the interests of the company at the risk of offending employees' feelings.
The most recent fracas over the plan to displace "Nightline" with Mr. Letterman's show -- which network news executives only learned about after a reporter from The New York Times called them -- is a case in point. "To a certain extent it didn't have to play out this way," said Dr. Martin Kaplan, director of the Lear Center at the University of Southern California, which studies entertainment and society. "But that's the way business is done in Hollywood."
Analysts agree that Mr. Eisner's most recent acquisition, of the Fox Family Channel for $3 billion. shows Disney's commitment to expanding its entertainment franchise. Last week, ABC hired John Madden to a four-year, $20 million contract to replace Dennis Miller on "Monday Night Football." Disney executives, too, have let it be known that they want to make more acquisitions, including buying television and radio stations as well as content.
But, Mr. Wolzien, the analyst, said, "There is no indication of interest in investing in news here."
The most interesting thing to watch is what Mr. Eisner does with the television assets over the next few years. So far the board, which has been criticized for being unwilling to challenge Mr. Eisner, seems unflinching in its support. Few people in Hollywood are counting Mr. Eisner out.
"Clearly he has demonstrated in the past that he has that talent," said Brad Grey, the producer of "Politically Incorrect," which is broadcast after "Nightline." "I'd like to stay at ABC."
But then again, he added, "You don't suppose I'd leave our fate up to the American Broadcasting Company, now do you?"

HEADLINE: Angry Europeans to Challenge U.S. Steel Tariffs at W.T.O. 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 5 

 BODY:
Steel producers from around the world angrily denounced President Bush's decision today to impose protective tariffs on imported steel and vowed to fight the plan at the World Trade Organization.
 More ominously for the Bush administration, many trade experts said today that the United States was on shaky legal ground. Over the last two years, the United States has lost at least three smaller cases in which it tried to restrict imports on the same legal principle cited in the steel case today. 
 In Europe, steel executives and trade experts say the justification for import restrictions is particularly weak because American steel imports declined substantially last year. 
"At first sight, you would have to say the United States will have a very difficult time making the case," said Lode Van Den Hende, a trade lawyer in Brussels with the British law firm of Herbert Smith.
The European Union immediately announced plans to attack any new steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization, which has international authority as a court in such trade disputes.
"The U.S. decision to go down the route of protectionism is a major setback for the world trading system," said Pascal Lamy, the European Commission's top trade official. "Imports are not the cause of U.S. difficulties, and the measures announced today will not only not provide a solution but aggravate matters."
South Korean steel producers complained that the United States was arbitrarily discriminating against them, imposing tariffs on imports from Asia but exempting imports from Mexico and Canada.
In Russia, the foreign ministry summoned the American ambassador in Moscow to warn of the "serious impact on Russian-American relations."
Two weeks ago, Russia's agriculture ministry said it would ban imports of American poultry beginning next week as a result of what it said was salmonella contamination. Russia accounts for about half of all American poultry exports.
Western European steel makers are much less worried about exports to the United States, which are modest, than they are about being swamped with excess steel from Asian and South American producers that can no longer sell in the United States.
"Diminishing exports to the U.S. is one issue, but even more damaging is the fact that everybody else's steel will be coming to us," said Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. "That's the real hammer blow for us."
The steel issue is certain to put new strain on relations among the United States and many of its closest allies. European leaders are already unhappy about President Bush's desire to expand the campaign against terrorism to countries like Iraq. 
But the steel issue has a particularly concrete effect on major corporations and jobs, so American tariffs are much more likely to lead to countermeasures than would disputes in other areas.
European leaders say the United States is merely trying to protect an industry that has not adjusted to changes in the world market. "The problem of the U.S. steel industry is not imports," said Guy Dolle, chief executive of Arcelor S.A., in Luxembourg, Europe's biggest steel producer. "The big problem in the United States is the legacy costs of the integrated steel companies," referring to their responsibility for pension and health benefits for retired steel workers.
Mr. Dolle noted that European steel makers had consolidated broadly through mergers the last 10 years. Arcelor itself is the result of the most recent merger of Usinor of France, Arbed of Luxembourg and Aceralia of Spain.
"Nothing like that has happened in the United States," Mr. Dolle said. "The United States has led the consolidation in almost every industry except steel."
In South Korea, industry executives were infuriated that the White House planned to impose stiff new tariffs on imports from Asia but not on producers in Canada and Mexico. "Why does the United States differentiate between nations?" asked Park Nei Hei, an economist on the board of Samsung. "As a Korean, I feel it's unfair."
Legal experts said the United States had to meet a difficult burden of proof if the tariffs were to survive challenge at the W.T.O.
The White House is justifying the new tariffs as a "safeguard" measure to protect its domestic steel industry from a surge in imports. Unlike a more typical antidumping case, the government is not arguing that foreign producers are competing unfairly. Rather, it is arguing that imports are causing serious damage to the industry.
Such actions are allowed under current international trade agreements. But they require showing that imports are the cause of the damage, and the W.T.O. has been very tough in demanding clear evidence.
Just two weeks ago, an appeals board of the organization, based in Geneva, rejected an American plan to impose safeguard tariffs on steel pipe from South Korea. Last year, it rejected two similar cases, one involving cotton yarn from Pakistan and another involving frozen lamb from New Zealand and Australia.
"The American case is pretty weak," said Romano Subiotto, a trade lawyer in Brussels with the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. "I think the U.S. is going to find it difficult to prove that the imports they are targeting are the reason for the injury to the steel industry."
Mr. Van Den Hende, the lawyer in Brussels, said the case was clouded by the fact that America's big steel makers are groaning under a number of their own problems. The biggest is that they are burdened by huge pension obligations that push their costs far higher than those of the smaller and more nimble minimills.
"You cannot impose safeguards and restrict imports in order to remedy injuries caused by other factors," Mr. Van Den Hende said. "If there is a whole host of other things responsible, then you at least have to make a distinction between the harm that comes from imports and the harm caused by other reasons."
Regardless of whether the United States wins or loses, European steel makers are already pressing political leaders to impose their own "safeguard" measures to protect themselves against a surge of new imports.
European Commission officials estimate that the tariffs would affect about four million tons of European steel exported to the United States. But they predict the American tariffs would divert an additional 16 million tons a year to Europe from other countries.

Grooming a Little Montmartre, Just North of the Bronx

BYLINE:  By EVE M. KAHN 

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
JAGON ELDRIDGE, a saxophonist, was spending $550 a month for a 6-by-6-foot cubicle with paper-thin walls on the Upper West Side, his ears assaulted by unruly children next door. Kate Wattson, a painter, was negotiating the end of her marriage from a sun-deprived garden apartment in Brooklyn Heights. John Pavlou, a sculptor, was living over his parents' grocery store, feeling utterly isolated from Manhattan artistic life. 
 Now, lured by ads that promised cheap housing for artists and musicians with sunset views of the Hudson River, all three are neighbors in this city of about 196,000 just north of the Bronx, a place they would hardly have expected to call home. Their small apartments are in the downtown waterfront district, in Philipsburgh Hall, a once decrepit 1905 landmark that overlooks church steeples and the New Jersey Palisades. Its 28 studios run less than $875 per month. A ballroom near the lobby, lined in carved garlands and fluted pilasters, is being turned into a communal gallery and performance hall. 
 "I told a friend the other day, 'Wow! I'm living in a building with a marble temple front!' " Mr. Pavlou said. The building is five minutes from the train station; from there it's half an hour to Grand Central Terminal ($8.50 round trip, off peak). 
There's only one potential drawback: almost no one lives nearby. Blocks of industrial brick buildings from the early 1900's sit crumbling on the waterfront, near a recently rebuilt covered pier. Shops on the side streets with gingerbread trim have been renovated but not yet rented. Ground was broken downtown on Monday for a new bakery by the star designer Maya Lin. It is as if this place were somewhat groggily awakening from decades of post-industrial slumber. 
"It looks a little like a movie set waiting for the set dressers," Mr. Pavlou said. He moved to Philipsburgh, on Hudson Street, shortly after it opened in November. The sometimes desolate neighborhood doesn't faze him. In that, he's like the artist-adventurers who braved early SoHo, made TriBeCa and discovered Dumbo. Pioneering has its advantages, Mr. Pavlou said: lots of trash heaps of wood and glass scraps for furnishings and sculpture.
Philipsburgh is owned by a neighboring Episcopal church and the Greyston Foundation, a charity based in Yonkers that offers housing and job training, among other services. Greyston's next act of civic beautification, on Ashburton Avenue, will be that bakery by Maya Lin, her first industrial building. The bakery's workers had been chronically unemployed before Greyston taught them how to cook. 
The city can certainly use some lucky breaks. Since the 1960's it has suffered not only the usual doldrums of former factory towns but also Westchester County's worst poverty levels, battles over the desegregation of housing and schools, and political scandals. To jump-start the economy and to attract a colorful and creative class of people willing to live in less-than-perfect surroundings, Yonkers is encouraging artists to move downtown, a strategy that has worked in other communities along the Hudson. 
A decade ago, Peekskill declared a four-block area an artists' district. Some 80 of them now live there, and 28 new lofts are being readied (investors have spent millions of dollars in the district, refurbishing at least three dozen buildings, according to Bernard Molloy, head of the local chamber of commerce). Further upriver, a branch of the Dia Center for the Arts will open in Beacon next year, and Hudson has become home to artists as well as antiques dealers. 
"Artists' housing has gone from an esoteric term to a buzzword," said Robert Lane, the director of the design program at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit urban planning group for the greater New York City area. First come the artists, and then ideally the galleries arrive, along with chic shops and restaurants. Part of its appeal, Mr. Lane added, is that "it generally doesn't bring children, with all the attendant issues of schools and services." But there's always a risk that, as in SoHo, the artists will gentrify an area too well. "They often price themselves out of their own good deeds," he said. 
It is likely that Yonkers will have to work hard not only to get artists, galleries and chic shops, but also to keep them. Leon Shilton, a finance professor at Fordham University who has analyzed the city's redevelopment plans, said he worries that newcomers to Yonkers could become disheartened by its fractious politics. 
Artists of various stripes have settled in Yonkers since the 19th century, mostly on its picturesque hilltops. The trompe-l'oeil muralist Richard Haas has lived for 22 years in an Arts and Crafts house perched on a riverfront cliff. His three murals near Philipsburgh Hall depict Yonkers's evolution from primeval shoreline to Victorian manufacturing hub. 
Downtown improvements since the late 1990's have been slow-paced, Mr. Haas acknowledged. "But there's enough commitment now that it should stick," he said. 
Philipsburgh, designed by the prolific local architect G. Howard Chamberlin, was originally an office building. The ballroom was used for performances and speeches by Clara Bow, Helen Hayes and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1978, in a previous attempt to revive downtown, the city built a colonnaded park around the corner. It was razed in 1988 partly because of complaints that it was attracting too many of what were considered unsavory characters.
"That they tore it down was mind-boggling to me," said Walter David Brown, a Manhattan architect who designed the site. He recently helped restore Philipsburgh, which had been condemned after a fire in 1997. The idea for making it an artists' colony came largely from the Rev. S. Burtner Ulrich, the rector of an Episcopal church across the street, St. John's (a Victorian pile undergoing its own $2.5 million overhaul). 
The colony, Father Ulrich said, is meant to enliven the neighborhood and turn the ballroom back into a cultural attraction. The city suggested that the church join with Greyston, which has already renovated 94 apartments in Yonkers for formerly homeless people. Rehabilitating Philipsburgh cost $7.5 million, with about a third of that money loaned by the city. 
All of the studios in Philipsburgh are occupied, and about 10 people are on a waiting list for units of 450 to 600 square feet including eat-in kitchens. Greyston has defined artist rather loosely: the occupants include interior and lighting designers, an urban planner and a gospel singer. Most are in their 20's and 30's. To qualify for a lease, they must earn less than $38,400 a year (for couples, $43,860). 
But the rents are not bargains, at least not in Yonkers, said Nortrud Wolf Spero, a real estate agent there. One-bedroom apartments larger than Philipsburgh's units are readily available for $750 a month, she said. What Philipsburgh offers is high-quality architecture, proximity to the stately train station and a budding artistic brotherhood. "It's a very positive, supportive environment," said Shanara Gabrielle, an actress who lives in the building with her high school sweetheart, Jeff Phillips, a composer and violinist.
Since 1982, Greyston has run a profitable baked-goods plant that supplies stores like Dean & DeLuca with cakes named Peanut Butter Explosion and Whiskey Pistachio Bundt, and Ben & Jerry's with its brownies. The $9 million Maya Lin building will replace the 7,000-square-foot bakery in downtown Yonkers. (The old facility will perhaps become a "small-business incubator for food-related manufacturing entrepreneurs," said Charles Lief, Greyston's president.)
On a polluted waterfront lot once occupied by a gas plant, the new bakery will have a roof garden and an atrium, giving workers river views and letting the public glimpse the baking process. 
"I wanted the building to be more spiritual than you'd expect," Ms. Lin said. On Yonkers's gritty streets, "it will glow like a beacon at night, telling people something unusual is going on here," she said. 
For now, the first landmark most New Yorkers notice in Yonkers is its copper-trimmed train station on Buena Vista Avenue, designed by Warren & Wetmore and Reed & Stem, the architects of Grand Central. Metro-North has announced it will renovate the station for $35 million. On Main Street, an old bar has been turned into the Coffee Break cafe, and there is talk up and down the street about other new restaurants in progress. A former trolley barn on the waterfront is slated to become upscale live-work lofts. And on a spit of riverbank just south of the station, the city is spending $7 million on a new park near a renovated pier that has jazz concerts in the summer and views of Manhattan. 
Philipsburgh's colonists are already leaping to their new home's defense. "The town's had its ups and downs like every place," said Mr. Phillips, the violinist. "It's gotten kind of a bad rap."
And attention, scoffers: just try finding a cut-rate loft in Williamsburg.

HEADLINE: China Is Increasing Its Budget For Military Spending by 17.6% 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 6 

 BODY:
China is increasing military spending this year by 17.6 percent, or $3 billion, bringing the publicly reported total to $20 billion, the finance minister announced today. 
 In a report to Parliament on the budget for 2002, the minister, Xiang Huaicheng, said continued large spending increases were needed for China's military "to utilize modern technology, especially high technology to raise our army's defense and combat capabilities," and to raise salaries for the country's 2.5 million officers and enlisted men. 
 The jump in spending follows many years of double-digit increases, reflecting China's effort to improve its mostly outdated forces and to attract better educated men into a military that has suffered from low morale. 
The publicly disclosed figures do not include major spending for weapons research and for the purchase of foreign weapons like two Russian-built destroyers China bought last year. Actual military spending may be three to five times the reported total of $20 billion, according to Western experts. 
China is believed to spend more on the military than any other country in Asia, but even the higher estimates are well below the spending levels of the United States, and the American technological advantage may, if anything, be growing, some experts say.
The Bush administration has proposed a $379 billion military budget for the next fiscal year, a 14.5 percent increase over the previous year's budget. 
Government spending over all will increase by 10 percent in the year ahead, expanding the deficit as officials try to prop up economic growth during the global slowdown, Mr. Xiang said. He promised a 28 percent increase in spending on living allowances for the unemployed, pensions and other social security measures "in order to protect social stability." 
Millions of farmers and workers in decrepit state industries are expected to lose their jobs in the years ahead as China further opens its markets to global competition within the rules of the World Trade Organization.

On Sunday, A License To Snoop

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
BY 1:40 last Sunday afternoon, the crowd outside the prewar co-op on West 83rd Street was growing restive. Twenty-one people -- a blonde with hair down to her waist, guys in leather jackets and a father with his baby in a backpack -- were waiting for the doors to open. All but the baby were clutching folded classified ads, with this item circled: "Best 2BR Value, Elev., hi ceils, French doors, park block." And then the kicker: "$399,000."
 New Yorkers have always been curious about the value of real estate -- theirs and everyone else's. But cruising open houses has become a weekend ritual. 
 So forget movies and museums. Open houses are waiting. Last Sunday, the word went out: there were bargain two-bedrooms on the Upper West Side, a cheap loft in TriBeCa ($850,000) and a killer one-bedroom on West End Avenue ($259,000). This was a free show: no admission charge, no invitation required. 
It's "the perfect post-9/11 activity," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, a real estate brokerage. "It combines the New York obsession with money and investment, and the post-September preoccupation with home and family." And although there is no citywide record of open-house attendance, Mr. Peters estimates that the number of shoppers has quadrupled since last year.
There have always been open houses, of course, but with low interest rates and hints of economic recovery, many more buyers and self-proclaimed real estate prognosticators are now beating paths to other people's doors.
In past years, open houses were businesslike affairs with a few serious buyers and a curious neighbor or two inspecting the cabinets and pacing out the bedrooms. But things have changed. On Sunday alone, there were 408 open houses in Manhattan, attended by thousands of inquisitive visitors. 
Over Sunday brunch, from E.A.T. on the Upper East Side to Bubby's in TriBeCa, house-hungry men and women map out the day's itinerary, circling promising ads with red pens. The scene shifts to acquaintances air-kissing in entrance halls of unfamiliar, unfurnished apartments.
Rather than dragging clients all over town, brokers now preside at the sign-in table. Last February, 25 people showed up at an open house for a five-room apartment on West 91st Street, according to Deanna Kory of the Corcoran Group. Last weekend, 77 signed in at a comparable apartment on West 79th Street. When inexpensive one- and two-bedrooms are advertised, the crowds are even larger.
Not everyone is just looking. In February 2001, 10 of their firm's deals resulted from open houses, reported Anita Perrone of the Corcoran Group; this February, the number reached 45. Paul Purcell, president of Insignia Douglas Elliman, estimated that his company's deals from open houses more than doubled from the same period a year ago.
On Sunday the clouds were sprinkling on West End Avenue, but the mood was festive as Joshua Zucker, a 26-year-old stock trader, recalled his recent adventures on the apartment circuit. "Last weekend, I met a woman at one open house, and we sort of went looking together," he said. "We went to one place; a FSBO," he said, showing off newly acquired real estate jargon. "You know, 'For Sale By Owner.' When we walked in together, the owner asked, 'Are you two married?' So we laughed, and I said, 'No, we're engaged,' and then we put on a show." 
He shrugged. "She gave me her number, but I never called. What are the chances? I ran into her in Macy's the next week -- when I was shopping for a birthday present for my real girlfriend." 
Like so many others these days, Mr. Zucker spends a lot of his time apartment-hopping. On Sunday he was joined by his twin brother, Jeremy, also a trader. 
When approached by a reporter, the Zuckers were in a one-bedroom at 675 West End Avenue. The broker, Clare Tomoney of Corcoran, said she already had an accepted offer for the $299,000 co-op but decided to hold the open house anyway.
Part of the fun of open house shopping is comparing notes with strangers and trying to uncover the seller's strategy. "I think they must not be sure of the offer," said Jesse Lunin-Pack, 29, an investment banker at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Lunin-Pack had heard that fewer than half the apartment owners lived in the building, making some banks reluctant to lend to new buyers there. If the accepted bidder could not find a mortgage easily, he or she might back off, clearing the way for another offer. Mr. Lunin-Pack left his name, just in case. 
A half-hour after the showing began, 10 or so people were milling around, even though the apartment was already taken. "I've seen cubbyholes for more money than this one," Joshua Zucker said.
The Zuckers then investigated 215 West 95th Street, a contemporary building ("Sun-splashed! Large 1BR, Walls of Wndws! Lux 24 HR Dm/Conc, Rf Deck, Gym, Grge"). Joshua Zucker's comments were equally abbreviated: "It's ugly. It's postwar. It has no character. And for the price -- no way." 
Real estate analysis is only part of the experience. During the open house, the brothers met JoAnn Hunter, a young actress in a black leather jacket who arrived on a bicycle. "I don't have to make a decision today," she said. "My time frame is like July-ish." She compared notes with the Zuckers in the elevator, then pedaled off to the next open house. 
To separate himself from the pack, Joshua Zucker is quick to tell brokers he is a serious buyer, and vows to find something by April 1. He is concentrating on the West Side, in the high 80's and 90's, and along with visiting open houses he scans the Internet. He has 10 favorite buildings and watches them like his favorite stocks, instructing several brokers to let him know the second anything opens up.
The Zuckers next checked out a "Terrace/Loft/Special" at 202 West 92nd Street priced at $415,000. The apartment, a big one-bedroom, is charming, with a working fireplace, a private roof deck and only one drawback: it's a fifth-floor walkup. The brothers climbed that high, continuing at a jogger's pace up the metal spiral staircase to the roof. After a cursory look at the view, they were ready to leave.
Brian Ronan, a Broadway sound consultant, and his friend Janet Dromgoole, a make-up artist, were more impressed. Mr. Ronan was touring open houses in order to decide if he should buy or sign another year's lease. While he declined to say how much rent he was paying, he emphasized that it was no bargain. For people like Mr. Ronan, open houses provide an easy way to gauge their options. 
The turnout was even bigger at 588 West End, where apartment 5D, a 650-square-foot one-bedroom ("Steal! Best brite 1BR in Prime Upper West Side Steps to Zabars and Riv Side Park"), was going for $259,000. The lobby was so chaotic by 2 p.m. that the doorman was acting as traffic cop, and the super had to start up the freight elevator. Upstairs, the broker, Chip Horne from Douglas Elliman, was ecstatic: after two hours, 85 people had come by, and he had a fistful of offers. (On Monday he said the owner had accepted an offer at the asking price.) 
When Mr. Lunin-Pack, the investment banker, walked in, the twins greeted him like an old friend. Another potential buyer, Olga Lifson, who is renting a studio and had perused three other apartments that day, joined the group.
"I just started last week," Ms. Lifson said. "I'm just trying to get a general idea of what's on the market." She is looking for an alcove studio or a one-bedroom, with space for a queen-size bed. 
The four left the open house together. Strolling along West End, they considered checking out the West 83rd Street two-bedroom advertised at $399,000. When they saw the line outside the front door, they went their separate ways with a chorus of farewells.
One of the people in line was Josh Galper, who stood on the third step with 14-month-old Jivan on his shoulders. "It's madness, what's going on," Mr. Galper said with a smile. "It's been like this ever since people lost faith in the stock market and have decided real estate is safer. And, from what we're told, there's not much available, and a lot of people looking for it." 
He glanced around. The agent was racing up to the entrance. "Hopefully, the market won't kill itself," Mr. Galper said, following her through the mahogany double doors.

HEADLINE: A Winning Strategy 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In a world teeming with war and terror, you take your good news where you can get it. And some of that good news is here in New York.
 You'd have to go back to 1962, when Robert Wagner was mayor and you could rent a three-bedroom apartment with a terrace on West 72nd Street for $149 a month, to find a month that had as few homicides as New York City had last month. 
 The 32 murders recorded by the Police Department in February was the lowest number in any month since the city began tracking crime statistics on a monthly basis in 1962. 
To paraphrase a mid-60's Sinatra hit, 1962 was a very mild year. John F. Kennedy was president, "The Sound of Music" was on Broadway, and you could take a nearly weeklong cruise to Bermuda for $160. The idea that the murder rate now would be the same as it was then is astonishing. 
The plunge in crime in New York since the bloodletting of the late 80's and early 90's has been breathtaking. And there are many reasons. The first, as Police Commissioner Ray Kelly puts it, is that "size matters." The New York police force, compared with departments in other big cities, is enormous. There are nearly 40,000 cops in New York. That's a small army. (Los Angeles, for example, with a population about half that of New York, has 8,900 officers.)
Plans for a big buildup in the size of the department began in the Dinkins administration. The buildup got under way in January 1994, when Rudolph Giuliani took office. That coincided with important advances in police management techniques.
Nearly all experts agree that New York has been extraordinarily sophisticated in the use of computerized strategies for the effective deployment of police officers. The Compstat program developed during the Giuliani years has become a model for much of the country and in many other parts of the world.
And even as the police force was expanding and Compstat was being put in place, the terrible plague of crack cocaine that had brought insane levels of violence to the city's streets began to ease. Attitudes in the hardest-hit neighborhoods changed. People were sickened by the violence. Children traumatized by the murder of older siblings or cousins or parents or friends turned away from crack, and crackheads eventually became pariahs.
I think young New Yorkers have gotten too little credit for the changes in their behavior that have contributed to the curtailment of crime in the city.
Also important was the city's commitment to getting guns off the street, and the enactment of federal gun control measures. Richard Aborn, a longtime gun control advocate, said, "We finally understood how inextricably linked guns are to violent crime, and that's had a big impact." 
Other reasons that are frequently cited may not have played as large a role as some people believe. The improved economy in the second half of the 1990's may have contributed to the national drop in crime. But it's not likely it played a significant role in New York. The turnaround here trailed that of the national economy. And New York's precipitous decline in crime was well under way by the time the city's economy rebounded.
Similarly, the enormous numbers of criminals locked up over the past decade or so would seem to have been a big factor in any drop in crime. But the evidence shows that this phenomenon was a bigger deal in places like Texas and California than in New York, where there was never a huge spike in the number of city residents locked up in state prisons. 
The recipe for success in New York has been more cops, smarter policing, fewer guns, a drastic decline in the use of crack and better behavior by young people.
So what's ahead? The city is facing huge budget problems that make it difficult to maintain Police Department strength at its highest levels -- a little over 40,000. There are about 38,000 officers now, and that will increase to 39,200 after July 1. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly have both said they will attempt to hold the line there. 
As for deployment, Mr. Kelly said, "We still have to keep ourselves focused very much on the issue of crime suppression." But in the aftermath of Sept. 11 the department also has what he described as "this sort of overarching issue that can't be ignored -- counterterrorism."
He said he was confident the department could do both.

HEADLINE: The Urge to Converge 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
"Mere size is no sin against the law," President William Howard Taft told Congress in 1911, in defense of the legislation that had enabled his G.O.P. predecessor, Teddy Roosevelt, to bust the trusts stifling competition. (Taft weighed over 300 pounds at the time.)
 The principle that it was not a corporation's size itself, but only the purpose or effect of its size and power on competition, lay at the heart of antitrust law for the past century. It is the basis of the Ashcroft Justice Department's recent cave-in to the growing monopoly that is Microsoft. 
 In the legal world, the result of the seeming sinlessness of size has been the megamergers that have concentrated economic power in a few predatory oil companies, a handful of accountancy firms and an ever-dwindling number of banks. 
In the world of telecommunications, the urge to converge has led to the creation of worldwide media empires that promised the happy marriage of news and entertainment content with the computer, wireless telephone and video -- all supposedly lowering prices to consumers with no restraint of trade or news. 
Does anyone believe that is what has been happening?
In the real world, intimidating "mere size" has become, when not sin itself, the occasion of sin. Today's any-merger-goes regulators permit cross-ownership of content and distribution while encouraging corporate titans with swollen egos to gobble up competitors or suppliers. Where does this power grab leave the innovative entrepreneur, the small business, the individual talent and the consumer?
Hugeness is necessary to compete with foreign biggies, goes the monopolist mantra -- as if most multinationals were not rooted in the U.S. Only the monster conglomerate can afford to invest in new technologies, complaisant Washington regulators tell us -- as if innovation and invention were not also found in small laboratories and the brains of creative loners. 
The swallowed-up company's resulting loss of corporate identity and dilution of mission can be found in the case of the Disney empire's decision to ruin the reputation of one of its purchases, ABC News. Ted Koppel's "Nightline," a respected news program turning a profit and holding its own against the late-night entertainment competition, is to be replaced by the David Letterman show, if Disney can entice the comedian from CBS. 
The reason is not so much the size of the audience reached, but its makeup. Letterman's banter appeals to youthful acquisitors, whom advertisers lust after; Koppel's news interests older people, who do less buying and more dying. Disney decision: Scrap the news, go with the jokes. 
Koppel's reaction was dismayingly mild, holding on this page that "it is perfectly understandable that Disney would jump at the opportunity to increase earnings. . . ." 
Now, if The Times were to replace this column with a comic strip, I like to think you would hear a geshrei from me and a keening wail from even critical readers that would rattle corporate rafters. The Times would not sacrifice serious opinion-mongering for comic relief because this focused $3 billion outfit understands that its reason for being is primarily to inform. The Disney combine's mission, contrariwise, is to dispense profitable entertainment, and its misbegotten purchase of a news medium allows it to prostitute ABC News's journalistic mission to conform to the parent company's different goal.
With the roundheeled Michael Powell steering the Federal Communications Commission toward terminal fecklessness; with the redoubtable Joel Klein succeeded at Justice's antitrust division by an assortment of wimps; and with appeals courts approving the concentration of media power as if nothing had changed since President Taft's day, the checks and balances made possible by diverse competition are being eradicated.
The longtime anti-business coloration of liberals reduces their ability to take on the convergence con. It is for conservatives to ask ourselves: Since when is bigness goodness? 
The Constitution's brilliant system of checks and balances restrains each government branch's power. We oppose the concentration of authority in the federal government, urging its devolution to states and localities. We seek to empower productive individuals by cutting taxes. Our mothers' milk is market competition. 
Why, then, should we supinely go along with the seizure of economic power by today's triopolies and duopolies on their march to becoming tomorrow's monopolies?

HEADLINE: Bill to Raise The Insurance On Deposits Has 2 Big Foes 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
A Congressional proposal to increase the amount of bank deposits protected by government insurance is facing opposition from the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve.
 The level has remained unchanged, at $100,000 a depositor, for more than 20 years, and an increase would be reassuring to consumers, many of whom have been looking for havens as stock prices have declined and more companies have fallen into bankruptcy. 
 A bill in the House and a similar proposal in the Senate call for an increase in coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to $130,000 a person. Deposit insurance covers losses if a bank or savings and loan fails. 
Both the Senate and the House bills recommend substantially more coverage for individual retirement accounts. The House proposal would increase coverage from $100,000 a person to $260,000 for I.R.A.'s, while the Senate is calling for an increase to $250,000.
The House bill will be marked up, or reviewed, today by the financial institutions subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee, according to Peggy Peterson, a spokeswoman for the committee. The increased coverage is part of a group of proposals being made to change the way the F.D.I.C., which insures depositors at 9,700 banks and savings and loans, administers insurance funds.
If the legislation passes, it would be the first increase in deposit insurance since the level was raised from $40,000 a depositor in 1980. The increase, particularly for retirement accounts, is being supported by community banks as a way to help them attract deposits. 
The provision, though, has attracted opposition from Federal Reserve and Treasury officials who say an increase in insurance would lead banks to make risky investments, because they know more of their customers' deposits have government backing.
Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill sent a letter to members of the House Financial Services Committee discouraging an increase in deposit insurance.
"The administration continues to believe that the deposit insurance coverage level should remain unchanged," the letter said. "There is no evidence that an increase in the coverage level would promote competition or materially improve the ability of community banks to obtain funds. An increase in coverage would primarily benefit high net worth individuals and do little for the great majority of savers, who have deposit balances far below the current coverage limit."
In testimony before the House last August, Sheila C. Bair, assistant secretary for financial institutions, quoted Federal Reserve data suggesting that only 2 percent of households with deposit accounts had any uninsured deposits.
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve, David Skidmore, declined to comment, other than to say the agency's position had not changed since last summer, when a former Federal Reserve governor, Laurence H. Meyer, testified against the deposit insurance increase.
Spencer Bachus, a Republican from Alabama and chairman of the House subcommittee on financial institutions, said he was not worried about the opposition. Mr. Bachus, who introduced the bill in February, said he had already cut back the increase in insurance from $150,000, and conceded there might still be "some modification." But he insisted that the jump in deposit insurance was needed, because inflation had eroded 60 percent of the $100,000 insurance protection.
Given the declines in the stock market and the crisis in investor confidence caused by the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, he said, consumers need to be able to rely on their banks. "We learned from Enron that people don't need to be losing their retirement funds that they worked so hard to get," he said.
The provision on deposit insurance also faces opposition from Phil Gramm, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee.
"To operate the banking system, you need a certain level of insurance," Senator Gramm said. "But you could lose some of the checks and balances." 
"People with over $100,000 in deposits will pay close attention to the condition of the bank itself, and have an incentive to be judicious" about where they deposit their savings, he added.
Mr. Gramm and others suggest that the last increase in deposit insurance may have contributed to the high number of savings and loan failures later that decade. At a Senate hearing last August, he said that during that period, "because of deposit insurance, deposits would come into a failing institution by the tens of millions of dollars and seize a higher rate of return with absolute certainty that the taxpayer was going to pick up the bill."
Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota and the bill's sponsor in the Senate, said the proposal was more relevant than ever despite some opposition. "The Fed and Treasury have not been enthusiastic about this," he said. "Given the volatility in the stock market now, it is important that people's financial strategies be broadened. People ought to be able to put a larger amount of money in their hometown bank if they want."

HEADLINE: GROUND ZERO: COMPENSATION; 
Charity Shifting Emphasis Away From Cash Payments

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
In six months, the Sept. 11 Fund has distributed $205 million, 85 percent of that in direct cash payments to victims. But in a major shift yesterday, the fund's leaders said that they now intended to sharply curtail direct grants to victims.
 Instead, they announced, most of their remaining donations, about $251 million, will be spent on mental health counseling, job training, small-business assistance and other programs aimed at addressing the region's long-term needs. 
 Joshua Gotbaum, chief executive of the fund, a joint project of the United Way of New York City and the New York Community Trust, said that yesterday's shift was prompted by a basic calculation. With so much money having already been distributed to victims from scores of charities and government programs, and with still more money yet to come from the federal Victims Compensation Fund, the time is right, he said, to focus on programs that will equip families and businesses to weather the years of hard times ahead. 
Mental health officials, for example, project that 30,000 people in New York alone will require counseling in the next year, he said at a news conference to report on the fund's first six months. Tens of thousands more will need job training. Hundreds of families will require financial advice and legal help as they sort out estates and custody issues.
After the bombing in Oklahoma City, Mr. Gotbaum noted, more victims sought counseling in the second year after the attack than in the first year. To bolster the point, he introduced Nancy B. Anthony, executive director of the Oklahoma City Community Foundation, who described herself as a "wounded veteran" of another time of national crisis.
"This process," she said, "is not about distributing money. This process is about helping people rebuild their lives."
In what amounted to a pointed critique of the charitable response to Sept. 11, Ms. Anthony explicitly warned against the favored approach of many funds: simply dividing up the money and sending out checks. In Oklahoma City, she said, families who received substantial cash payments often "wound up back on our doorsteps" after spending the money unwisely.
"It's not necessary to divide money up and hand it out," she said, urging charities to adopt a more traditional role of responding to demonstrated needs based on careful assessments of families.
But until now, that has not been the primary approach of the Sept. 11 Fund, the second largest fund set up in response to the attacks. According to the fund's six-month report, $175 million of the $205 million distributed thus far has been in direct cash assistance to victims and their families.
Most of the 3,200 families with relatives who were killed or severely injured received cash payments of $20,000. Of the 3,000 displaced families and 32,500 people who lost jobs, most received $4,000.
The other $30 million was distributed as loans or grants to community organizations, rescue and recovery groups and other services, like a telephone support line for victims. The Sept. 11 Fund's administrative costs, about $1.4 million a year, are being covered by separate donations from several foundations, officials said.
Franklin Thomas, chairman of the Sept. 11 Fund, said that although estimates are difficult, his instinct told him that no more than 25 percent of the fund's remaining $251.4 million would be paid out as cash grants to individual families and victims.
What this means, in effect, is that the tens of thousands of people thrown out of work by the attacks will now have to go elsewhere for any future cash aid, fund officials said. But they argued that donors never intended for the Sept. 11 Fund to become a substitute for government unemployment assistance. To continue giving money directly to the unemployed would leave little money for long-term needs, fund officials said.
Meanwhile, in another development yesterday, Eliot L. Spitzer, the state attorney general, announced that he would endorse the proposed transfer of nearly $100 million from the city's Twin Towers Fund to a private charity of the same name controlled by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor.
Many families had opposed the transfer, but Mr. Spitzer, who regulates charities in New York, said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani had agreed to meet several conditions to secure his approval of the transfer.
Mr. Giuliani will allow Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to name 20 percent of his charity's board members. He will also allow victims to name a board member, and he has agreed that his charity will be subject to audits by the city comptroller.
If the transfer is approved in court, as it must be, Mr. Giuliani has also agreed to distribute all $100 million within 60 days. The money is to be divided among the families of about 430 uniformed and civilian rescuers who died in the collapse of the World Trade Center, precisely the approach Ms. Anthony so passionately discouraged yesterday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Users of Steel Worry That Tariffs Will Be Costly 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Gary Hill, the president of National Metalwares, cannot yet quantify the effect steel tariffs will have on his business. But he assumes it will not be small, and it will not be good. 
 National Metalwares, at about $30 million in revenue, is small, but Mr. Hill said it had traditionally commanded a solid share of the market for tubular steel components used in school furniture and engine-powered lawn products like mowers or weed trimmers. But steel represents some 46 percent of the cost of making those products, and Mr. Hill fears that if tariffs cause his steel prices to shoot up then foreign competitors who use untaxed steel will eat away at his market share. 
 "We're going to be at a 20 to 25 percent cost disadvantage to offshore manufacturers who may now choose to target the U.S. market," Mr. Hill said. "And our customers may wind up under attack from offshore competitors now, too."
Across the country, users of steel -- be they small companies like National Metalwares, which is based in Aurora, Ill., or mega-users like General Motors -- are starting to assess the implications of the Bush administration's decision to impose tariffs of 8 percent to 30 percent on much imported steel. Few seem optimistic.
"Shipyards are busy now, but if steel prices go up, barge customers may postpone buying," worried Danny Irby, vice president for production at Jeffboat, a shipbuilding company in Jeffersonville, Ind.
Even companies whose customers cannot easily postpone purchases are concerned.
"Steel is a significant component of our products, and our industry information says we could be looking at upward pricing pressure in the range of 10 to 20 percent," said Christopher P. Feeney, a spokesman for Hillenbrand Industries, a company in Batesville, Ind., that makes coffins and health care equipment.
Still, no one is panicking -- yet. Since most companies buy steel on long-term contracts, few fear immediate price fluctuations.
"Steel prices are so low and the supply so flush that it looks like we'll be O.K. for the immediate future," said John F. Hessmer, vice president for construction at the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation, a New York City company that builds corporate and industrial sites across the country.
Joseph Hice, a spokesman for the Harley-Davidson Motor Company in Milwaukee, which uses primarily domestic steel, is equally sanguine. "We have good long-term relationships with our suppliers, so the tariffs shouldn't affect us," he said.
Some companies -- manufacturers of beverage cans, for example -- will probably pass added costs onto consumers, because few customers would pay to ship empty steel cans across oceans. The largest users, automakers, say, or big appliance makers, are such important customers for steel producers that competition may keep their prices low. 
Indeed, many applaud the tariffs for potentially maintaining healthy competition among domestic steel makers, even as they express concern that they will drive domestic prices up. "It's a double-bind situation," said Steven Gaut, a spokesman for Delphi Automotive Systems in Troy, Mich., which supplies many components for General Motors. 
Still, even the largest companies are not shrugging off the ramifications of the announcement on Tuesday. "It's too soon to assess the impact, but we certainly have a lot of people working on this," said Terrence C. Dunn Jr., a spokesman for GE Appliances, the General Electric unit in Louisville, Ky., that buys 210,000 tons of cold-rolled steel a year, all from American suppliers.
For many companies, pricing is less a concern than availability. Many worry that the hefty tariffs will drive away foreign suppliers, yet will not provide the economic support American companies need to stay solvent.
"The strength of the dollar, capacity usage -- there are plenty of issues affecting the long-term viability of the domestic steel industry," said Brian VanDommelen, who sets steel procurement strategies for Steelcase, the big furniture maker in Grand Rapids, Mich.
Others worry that American producers cannot provide superstrong or other specialty steels. Robert S. Miller, chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Bethlehem, Pa., and an officer of the American Iron and Steel Institute, insists that American companies can provide any type of steel. But users say that is not true. 
For example, Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer in Peoria, Ill., successfully lobbied to have some of the steel it imports from Britain and elsewhere exempted from the tariff rules. But Lewis E. Leibowitz, a lawyer for the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition, a polyglot group of medium-size steel users that has long lobbied against tariffs, readily lists numerous companies that he said had tried -- unsuccessfully -- to obtain superstrong or other specialty steels from domestic suppliers, and had simply given up.
"American steel companies can say that steel is fungible, but it's just not," he said.
In general, representatives of trade associations have been far less guarded in their comments than the companies they represent. For months, the Iron and Steel Institute, the primary steel industry trade group, and Mr. Leibowitz's group, have been trotting out dueling economists and other experts to prove mutually exclusive points.
The steel makers have "proved" that tariffs will save jobs without much effect on prices, and that American steel makers can provide any steel that any user needs. "The impact on customers will be nothing like the hysteria that we've been reading in the press," Mr. Miller of Bethlehem said.
The users' group insists that jobs will be lost, prices will skyrocket and companies will not have access to steel that they need. 
"This remedy will do more harm than good," Mr. Leibowitz countered.

PERSON: Marc V. Shaw 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
He Never Asked to Be the Mayor on Weekends

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
FROM the stink of things in his underdecorated but aggressively aromatic City Hall office, it is evident that Marc V. Shaw, New York City's deputy mayor for operations and, more famously, its mayoral surrogate when the boss sneaks those secret weekends out of town, has just parted company with a cigar. Maybe that's why he's being such a grouch: separation anxiety. 
 It turns out our favorite surrogate smokes economy, non-Cuban stogies, $2.50 a pop at a two-a-day pace, always behind closed doors: Mr. Shaw likes his privacy. And he is cost-conscious: main indulgence, season tickets to the Mets. But somewhere along the line he's sampled a top-shelf cigar. "Cubans get you high," he says, an off-the-cuff grin briefly replacing a standoffish scowl, his prevailing expression in an oft-interrupted hour of reluctant revelations. "What do we need, 5, 10 more minutes?" he asks every 5 or 10 minutes until he's saved by the bell, a summons from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose penchant for weekend privacy has cost Mr. Shaw his. 
 "I don't enjoy being in the public eye. I'm a staff person, not an elected official," he protests from behind a bedrock of gray stubble -- he doesn't enjoy shaving, either. "I'm just doing my job, and the part of this I find bizarre and sad is that the actual result of the media's dealing with the mayor's desire for privacy on weekends has been to impinge on mine." True enough.
So that's why he's acting like a grouch, slouched in a chair with his knees drawn up, feet planted on the coffee table, a hand shielding his mouth, as close to the fetal position as a balding adult in a rumpled white dress shirt and red tie can be while handling an inquiry he finds, well, impinging. Or is he just shy? Simply getting him to reveal his age, 47, and salary -- "$168,200 or something" -- feels like an exorcism. 
Mr. Shaw is out of sorts because suddenly, involuntarily, he is a pseudocelebrity, a butt of jokes, and the victim of an executive order stipulating that the deputy mayor for operations fills in when Mr. Bloomberg is away. He's no stranger to working weekends. "My kids used to say the difference between weekdays and weekends was that on weekends Daddy went to work in regular clothes instead of a suit." But an obligation that seemed innocuous has become an albatross.
First came the scruffy photo in The New York Post, snapped on a Saturday morning as he ventured outside to fetch his newspaper in Bayside, Queens, where he lives with his wife, Mary-Jane, a lawyer turned stay-at-home mom, and their three sons. Then came a week's worth of jokes on "Late Show With David Letterman," some ribald, all giddily portraying Mr. Shaw as a public official bursting with lowest-common-denominator male proclivities (i.e., a zest for wrestling, strip clubs, sloppiness).
"If they have a problem with the mayor's privacy issues, why are they picking on me?" grouses Mr. Shaw, echoing a lament already voiced by his spouse.
No, he doesn't appreciate last week's national exposure as star of a Letterman Top 10 list. No, he doesn't plan on framing it for posterity. "I'm not much on framing things," he says, indicating the bare office walls. "Hey, can we talk about something else? This is boring." 
Time to abandon a sore subject and move on, what with Mr. Shaw threatening to develop lockjaw and a steady stream of earnest underlings hammering away on his door like woodpeckers. 
Time to find out how this plum political post, for which he took a pay cut after resigning as executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (he's the forward-thinker who brought us E-ZPass and the MetroCard), fell into his lap like the string of other plums before it. Hint: he's a sharp fiscal manager in a crisis, not a cronyism hire. He didn't even get to know the new mayor until after the election. 
"I didn't think he was going to win," says Mr. Shaw, a bipartisan player who has toiled for the State Senate Finance Committee (1981-88), Peter F. Vallone (as his chief fiscal adviser and finance director for the City Council), Rudolph W. Giuliani (as his budget director and finance commissioner), and Gov. George E. Pataki (the M.T.A. job was secured with his say-so in 1996). 
Media intrusions aside, he considers this his pinnacle, even saddled with a $4.7 billion deficit he needs to shrink without endangering city services. "In a nutshell, it's like being the chief operating officer of the city, given the way this mayor operates and delegates." 
The deputy claims his "whole career is an accident," says he would rather run for his life than run for elected office and occasionally wishes he had stuck to academia. A Kenyan scholar, Simeon Chilungu, was his anthropology professor and mentor at SUNY-Buffalo. Mr. Shaw, an urban anthropologist from Plainview, in Nassau County, figured to end up in the professorial ranks, too. He moved from Buffalo to Hoboken, N.J., to compose his doctoral thesis on Hoboken's gentrification but hit a snag, ran low on funds, and when he got a paying offer to do econometrics research for the Wharton School instead of his own, he jumped. The subject was this city's 1980 fiscal crisis. 
What he learned continues to come in handy.

HEADLINE: The Recovery That Defied The Forecasts Of Economists 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The economy's quick recovery from recession, evinced by the latest reports from the Commerce Department and the Federal Reserve, has taken many experienced forecasters by surprise.
 Their favorite explanation has been the unexpected resilience of consumers after the shock of Sept. 11. Yet at the end of last year, strong gains in productivity -- the amount of goods the average American worker produces in an hour -- also played an important and largely ignored role. 
 Yesterday, the Commerce Department released new figures showing a pickup of 1.6 percent in orders for manufactured goods in January, after an increase of 0.7 percent in December. Last week, the department revised its estimate of growth in gross domestic product for the final quarter of last year to 1.4 percent from 0.2 percent. 
The beige book of reports from the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, also released yesterday, described more signs of improvement in manufacturing, especially along the Eastern Seaboard and in auto-producing states like Michigan and Ohio. On the retail side, sales of home furnishings and appliances began to gain momentum in the Midwest. Though vacancies grew in commercial real estate across the country, home sales remained strong.
The Fed reported little change in labor markets, where employers cut bonuses and delayed raises in January and February. Contrary to the expectations of economists, however, the Fed's contacts hinted that the economy would soon start creating more jobs than it lost.
Even though the private sector has shed more than a million jobs, companies have still managed to turn out the goods and services consumers want, at prices they can afford, because of rising productivity.
Forecasters who doubted the economy's ability to grow at the end of last year may not have taken into account the effects of productivity because its growth was so unusual. 
"If productivity grows, the economy does well," said Edward C. Prescott, a professor at the University of Minnesota and senior adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Mr. Prescott contended that Wall Street's seers did not pay enough attention to productivity.
"I don't think they had a good basis for their forecasts," Professor Prescott said. "Sometimes pessimism or optimism gets popular, and it's contagious."
Rising productivity has enabled many companies to meet demand for their products even while reducing their work forces. "It's certainly been helpful in how we do our restructuring in ensuring that we be as cost effective as we can," said Martha Depenbrock, a spokeswoman for Procter & Gamble, which laid off 10,000 people last year.
Ms. Depenbrock said that Web-based management of payrolls, for example, had cut costs and freed time for other activities. The company has also achieved productivity gains -- and cost savings of $1 billion -- with a new method for developing manufacturing systems, she said. Procter & Gamble has already licensed the system to other businesses.
Rising productivity is by no means routine in a recession. "Productivity has stayed reasonably strong throughout, which is not your typical pattern," said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
During the last 30 years, the average annual growth rate of productivity in all quarters was 1.7 percent. In quarters that included periods of recessions, as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research, productivity shrank at an average annual rate of 0.35 percent. Yet in the three quarters since the most recent recession began in March 2001, productivity has clocked annual growth rates of 2.1 percent, 1.1 percent and 3.5 percent.
That last figure could be adjusted higher this morning, when the Labor Department releases its final estimates for the fourth quarter. Last week's upward revision of growth in gross domestic product for the fourth quarter suggests that workers were even more productive than initially thought.
"The productivity numbers have been holding up quite well," said Professor Prescott. "I suspect they'll be even higher with this revision in G.D.P. growth."
Productivity affects companies' ability to supply diverse goods and services at low prices. But in the last several months, most analysts concentrated on the demand side of the economy's grand equation, with a particular focus on the consumer. They still predicted that recovery would be slow to arrive.
Debating the economy's prospects after the terrorist attacks last September, the top forecasters at J. P. Morgan Chase decided that consumers were likely to retrench, said James E. Glassman, the bank's senior United States economist. In mid-December, J. P. Morgan Chase was predicting that the economy would contract by 2 percent in the fourth quarter. Other forecasts were more upbeat, but few predicted anything like the actual figure of 1.4 percent growth.
"It looks to me like that event just encouraged them to keep doing what they always do," Mr. Glassman said of consumers after Sept. 11. "There is a psychological dimension, and I think some clever companies figured out how to tap into this."
He called the "Keep America Rolling" slogan used by Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, particularly ingenious and perhaps a distraction from hard financial information. "I'm not sure the deals you got were that great when you walked away from the lot," he said.
Wall Street forecasters may also have overestimated consumers' reaction to the huge destruction of shareholder wealth in the stock markets last year. "Some, say on Wall Street, seemed to extrapolate their own portfolios to the rest of the population," said Dean M. Maki, an economist at Putnam Investments who studied the effects of changes in wealth while at the Federal Reserve. "The typical Wal-Mart shopper isn't affected very much one way or another by the way the stock market goes, whereas the typical Tiffany shopper probably is."
Improvements in productivity, even during a recession, can have lasting benefits. Businesses that try to do more with less can learn valuable lessons for helping productivity in the future, Mr. Litan of Brookings said. Companies do not forget how to make workers more efficient once a recession ends, he said.
The strong growth in productivity in the fourth quarter may not last, however.
"There's not strong empirical evidence that the productivity growth rate will stay up there," Professor Prescott said. "I expect it to stay on its trend, which is that nice 2 percent a year."
Productivity growth is hard to predict, he added. For example, a theory that was once popular stated that the gains from the technological discoveries of the 1970's, when productivity growth slinked along at less than 2 percent, did not show up until the technologies became part of business practices in the 1990's. But the theory worked only for some countries.
"Some people have argued that some new things come along and it takes a while before you can really exploit them," Professor Prescott said.
"If there's a slingshot, why didn't Japan do well when the United States and Europe were doing well?"

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SENATE HEARINGS; 
Some See Panic As Main Effect Of Dirty Bombs

BYLINE:  By JAMES GLANZ with ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6 

 BODY:
Radioactive materials in wide use in the United States could be turned into weapons of terror that would probably kill few people but would spread panic and produce severe economic damage, scientists told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today. 
 The materials would not produce nuclear explosions. Rather, they would be spread using conventional explosives in so-called dirty bombs. The scientists who testified at the committee's hearing today said such weapons were a potentially serious problem. 
 The most dangerous materials, they said, are bars of radioactive cobalt used to irradiate food, medical devices and other products to sterilize them. If turned into fine particles and dispersed under the right weather conditions, the cobalt could spread enough radiation to force the abandonment of an area the size of Manhattan, the scientists said. But federal and industry officials said such an action with radioactive cobalt was unlikely because of the intense radiation to which the person trying to use the weapon would be exposed and because the material is transported in secret and kept behind tons of lead and other shielding while on the road or in use. 
Other radioactive materials in tens of thousands of medical and industrial devices could be used to make weapons that would leave wide areas with radiation levels above Environmental Protection Agency limits, possibly leading to temporary evacuation and an extremely difficult cleanup. 
"Radiological terrorism is a very plausible threat," said Dr. Steven E. Koonin, a physicist and national security expert who is provost of the California Institute of Technology.
The necessary radioactive materials are relatively common, he said, and "the expertise for handling is widely known and readily acquired." 
Scientists at the hearing held to understand these threats and to devise ways of protecting Americans against them also said that they remained concerned that fissionable material -- the fuel for nuclear weapons -- and the expertise needed to use it could be spreading from the former Soviet Union to terrorist networks, but presented no new evidence of such leakage. 
Much of the testimony focused on commonplace industrial materials like radioactive cesium, widely used in devices that check the quality of welds, test the integrity of oil pipelines and even measure the thickness of asphalt on roadways. Medical probes and other devices also rely on materials of this kind. 
Dr. Richard A. Meserve, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that all such materials, as well as the much more powerful cobalt rods used in sterilizing food, are tightly controlled. He said that the weaker sources, if dispersed, would cause almost immeasurably small increases in cancer rates among people who were exposed. 
Ideally, he said, evacuations from contaminated areas could be orderly. "It would not be such a crisis that if it took people 20 minutes or an hour to get out, it would be a disaster," Dr. Meserve said. 
Nevertheless, that sort of attack could cause long-term problems because techniques for dealing with radioactive contamination rely largely on demolition and removal, Dr. Henry Kelly, president of the Federation of American Scientists, said. Because limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency for radiation exposure are so low, areas might have to be evacuated for the long term even when the health risks are relatively slight, he said. 
Dr. Kelly offered a case study of what might happen if a dirty bomb containing a cobalt food irradiation bar exploded at the southern tip of Manhattan on a day with a light wind blowing toward the northeast. He calculated that Manhattan as far north as Central Park would be contaminated at levels similar to those in the permanently closed zone around the Chernobyl power plant. Manhattan would have to be abandoned for decades, Dr. Kelly said. 
The scientists said that they believed anyone trying to transport and process the highly radioactive materials would be detected. 
"I am comfortable because of the heightened awareness and security at those plants," Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said. But, he said, "I'd be even more comfortable" if technology to replace the radioactive bars could be developed. 
Thousands of cobalt-60 rods are used in more than 160 food sterilization centers, 40 in the United States, federal regulators said. 
Federal nuclear officials and executives in the sterilization industry said yesterday that it would be extraordinarily difficult for terrorists to steal and use the 18-inch-long rods, the most common radiation source in the industry.
"An individual physically handling an unshielded single source rod would receive a lethal (death within weeks) dose in about a minute, and an incapacitating dose (immediately deadly) in about 20 minutes," said an e-mail statement from Neil A. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses businesses using the materials.

HEADLINE: A Struggling Town, A Hesitant Hope; 
Memories Tinge a Business's Plan

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: MECHANICVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
One day in January, a Canadian entrepreneur appeared out of the northern blue and said that of all the places in North America, he had chosen this proud but wobbling little city as the future site of a new company in the suddenly sexy business of emergency preparedness.
 "Mechanicville will be put on the map," the entrepreneur, Raymond Henry, explained over his cellphone. "They have to be prepared. It's a small city to receive 500 people a week. They will open restaurants; they will open hotels." 
 Talk like that tends to get attention in this city of less than a square mile, a city whose population is plummeting, a city with no hotels and whose best-known restaurant, Joyce's Log Cabin, is shuttered. Mechanicville is hardly the only upstate community pining for a savior to restore its luster, but Mr. Henry's proposal received particular attention. It could -- could -- mean the city's first economic boost since the dominant paper mill closed a generation ago. 
A memorandum of understanding was signed. A news conference was held. And the Web site for Mr. Henry's new company, the Cogesur Group, now includes references to the "First International Municipal and Emergency Management Center, Mechanicville, N.Y.," alongside an icon of an ever-fluttering flag.
But hesitation lingers in Mechanicville. People here have not forgotten the time, a quarter-century ago, when a man named Bob John Ray came through town. Or was it Billy Ray Bob? Anyway, this smooth talker with three first names was down at Joyce's Log Cabin for a few days, claiming to have pockets deep enough to pull out new cars for anyone who made him chuckle or weep.
The few people who did not smell a flimflammer jockeyed to become his new best buddy, which meant that he never had to pay his bill -- not as long as he kept sending folks to a local car dealership to choose the color of their new Mercury Cougars. He vanished, of course, without buying so much as a pine-scented car freshener. But he did give Mechanicville a metaphor to describe anything too good to be true, as in: 
Here comes another Bob John Ray. Or Billy Ray Bob. Or whatever.
This is not to say that Mr. Henry's integrity is in question. But Bob John Ray references are definitely back in vogue, and here is why. 
So far there is not much more to Cogesur's plan, beyond Mr. Henry's assurances of an imminent $20 million investment from people about whom nothing is known, except that they divined opportunity in the Bush administration's recent promise to spend more money on emergency preparedness. Plus, the whole plan hinges on voters' approving the sale of a soon-to-be-vacated elementary school to Mr. Henry at a better rate than you could find at the Family Dollar store in town. (That photograph on the company's Web site, the one with Cogesur's logo already adorning a sign outside the school building? It's just a composite.)
Then there was Mr. Henry's casual inquiry into whether the city would be willing to double the assessment of the five-acre property, to nearly $12 million. Mr. Henry said that a higher assessment would help in financing the project. Anthony Luciano, the city assessor, said that in his 12 years in office, "no one's ever asked me to raise an assessment." 
City officials want Cogesur so much that they are about ready to learn French, but first things first. For starters, Mr. Henry has to show them the money.
"You hate to blow him off," said William E. Connors, the city's administrator of community development. "I'm the guy that's the most cautious and most concerned about his ability. I'm the one who keeps bringing it up and people keep saying, 'Don't scare him off. Don't scare him off. We blow him off and he opens up in Troy, and we're kicking ourselves.' "
The last thing Mechanicville needs is another kick to its collective head.
It was once a microcosm of American industry, with paper rollers humming 24 hours a day at the Westvaco mill, freight trains rumbling through one of the country's largest railroad transfer stations, and streets bustling with immigrants and their children. The city may not have been as vital as Albany, 20 miles to the southwest, but it had a sense of place, and commemorated many of the local men who died in World War II with a plaque inside the elementary school. There are 44 names.
Now, the evidence of decline can be found in the census statistics kept in City Hall -- the population of 5,000 is less than half of what it was in the 1920's -- and in City Hall itself, where white paint peels from the facade. Even the tornado that tore through here in 1998, causing $50 million in damage, seemed almost gratuitously cruel. Did it really have to knock over one of the old mill's smokestacks?
Mechanicville survived that twister just as it has survived all the other setbacks. The school district began to build a new elementary school, scheduled to open in the fall of 2003. Local officials were still wondering what to do with the old school when there came an inquiry from Canada.
Within days, Mr. Henry was in Mechanicville, laying out his proposal. He would transform the school building into a center where police and municipal officials from around the country would come to learn Cogesur's computer-software program for emergency preparedness. Instead of youngsters learning long division, the school would have classrooms of adults learning to prepare for "floods, bioterrorism, earthquakes, bombs," Mr. Henry said.
Mr. Henry, 44, who said he was a former paramedic with a background in software, said that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 had highlighted the need for "homeland security," and that governments would be spending billions to secure their communities. "Billions of dollars," he said. "Billions. B, as in boy."
The entrepreneur has six other partners, and his company's Web site (cogesur.com) sports the logos of other Canadian companies, including Novasys, which specializes in online learning and management. Mario Robert, the president of Novasys, said that he had met with people from Cogesur about a year ago -- "They have good people in the company" -- but had not heard from them since.
"What I told them was you get a contract, we will deliver the product," Mr. Robert said. But, he added, "We have no link with those people."
The biggest issue, of course, is money. Mr. Henry said that a "group of venture capitalists" planned to invest $20 million in the next month or so; he declined to identify the investors, other than to say that they were "mostly big banks" in the United States that were interested in getting in on a growth industry. 
He said he was working out of the office of a public relations firm, K2 Communications, that Cogesur would buy once the money came through. Philippe Dorget, a co-owner of K2 and the vice president for communications for Cogesur, confirmed this arrangement.
But why Mechanicville? "I always joke with the people of Mechanicville," Mr. Henry said. "It's the smallest city in the state of New York but if you draw a circle of a three-hour drive from it you have access to 100 million people."
The school board quickly approved a plan to sell the school and its five-acre riverfront property for $1, with the understanding that Cogesur would pay $350,000 to the school district over the next year -- and on the condition that the proposal pass a local referendum. City officials, meanwhile, are doing background checks and holding their breath; the issue is so fragile that Mayor Thomas J. Higgins declined to talk about it.
But Joseph Waldron, the police chief, said that he especially liked Mr. Henry's proposal that the small Police Department be moved out of City Hall's basement and into the training center, to be held up as a model of Cogesur efficiency. "We're cramped in a place where we have the boiler for all of City Hall," he said. "And when it rains, it all pours down the street and somehow makes its way to the police station."
More important, the whole city would benefit, he said.
But Chief Waldron is hedging his exuberance. "It's like any start-up company," he said. "It could be the greatest thing in the world, or it could be a flop. We've been burned before."
Paul J. Loatman Jr., the city's historian and a former school board member, is among the more skeptical people in town. He said that Mr. Henry had given the city no evidence that he had any financial backing at all, and yet Mechanicville is poised, basically, to give him five acres of riverfront property.
"I love this community, but I don't suspend my judgment," Mr. Loatman said. "This is a great place to raise a family, but your kids get educated, there's nothing here for them, so they leave. That's the way it's been for a generation.
"You don't want to rain on this guy's parade. But we don't need another Bob John Ray, Billy Bob Ray, whoever the heck that was."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Surge, Driven by Signs of a Strong U.S. Recovery

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks jumped yesterday as a rise in factory orders and a survey of business conditions gave fresh evidence that a strong economic rebound was in the making.
 "The market continues to get strength from economic numbers," said Michael Palazzi, co-head of equity trading for CIBC World Markets. 
 Wireless stocks were among the best performers after Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance telephone company, reaffirmed its 2002 financial outlook for its long-distance and Sprint PCS wireless divisions. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index hit its first four-day winning streak since early November. 
"People feared the worst but it seems the underlying fundamentals are intact," said Seth Tobias, who oversees $500 million in hedge funds for Circle T Partners.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 140.88 points, or 1.35 percent, to 10,574.29, pushed higher by J. P. Morgan Chase.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 16.63 points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,162.77, closing at its highest level since Jan. 7. The Nasdaq climbed 24.11 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,890.39.
Market breadth was positive, especially on the New York Stock Exchange where 11 stocks rose for every 4 that declined. Nasdaq advancers beat losers 11 to 6.
Recent economic data have pointed to an uptick in economic activity.
A reading on United States orders for manufactured goods showed a rise of 1.6 percent in January, beating expectations.
The economy showed hints in the first two months of the year that it was recovering from recession, the Federal Reserve said yesterday in its beige book, an anecdotal report card on economic conditions across the country.
"People have responded to better economic data in hopes that will help corporate profits," said Kevin Logan, senior market economist for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.
J. P. Morgan Chase jumped $1.54, to $34.05, after Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown raised its rating to strong buy from buy.
Sprint rose $1.27, to $15.83, after saying its wireless business would add more subscribers in the first quarter than analysts were expecting. Its wireless unit, Sprint PCS, bolted $1.92 higher, to $11.47.
Nextel Communications rose 80 cents, to $6.28, after its chief financial officer said he was confident about meeting forecasts for full-year cash flow and subscriber growth.
AT&T Wireless Services was the most active issue on the Big Board and rose 74 cents, to $9.27.
Compaq Computer, the acquisition target of Hewlett-Packard, rose 40 cents, to $10.98. Hewlett lost 42 cents, to $20.18.
Hewlett won crucial backing on Tuesday for its $22 billion bid to acquire Compaq when a leading adviser to major investors urged shareholders to approve the contested deal. The vote is two weeks away. 
ImClone Systems, which agreed to new terms with Bristol-Myers Squibb for their drug development partnership, jumped $4.81, to $28.63. --------------------

Treasuries Fall
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bonds fell yesterday after factory orders rose in January, adding to concern the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by midyear to temper inflation.
The manufacturing report is the latest sign the economy is rebounding from a yearlong recession, which helped push the benchmark 10-year Treasury rates to a three-year low in November. Investors have sold the securities in recent days, pushing yields to levels not seen since the end of January.
By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 9/32, to a price of 98 21/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 5.05 percent from 5.01 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond also fell, dropping 22/32, to a price of 97 19/32. Its yield rose to 5.54 percent from 5.49 percent.

NATIONAL STEEL SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The National Steel Corporation filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday because of low prices and a weak economy. 
The filing came a day after the Bush administration imposed tariffs on most steel imports. National Steel, majority owned by the NKK Corporation of Tokyo, said it received a $450 million loan to continue operating plants. The company, based in Mishawaka, Ind., makes about six million tons of steel a year and has 8,400 employees. National Steel, which had $2.49 billion in sales last year, listed $2.61 billion in debt and $2.3 billion in assets, according to papers filed in bankruptcy court in Chicago. National Steel has lost money in six consecutive quarters.

HEADLINE: U.S. Duties On Steel Anger Russia 

BYLINE:  BySABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 6 

 BODY:
A trade dispute between Russia and the United States escalated today, as punitive American duties on steel from Russia -- and elsewhere -- brought angry words from officials and fresh statements about a ban on American poultry.
 The tariffs announced Tuesday by President Bush angered all the nations affected, including Japan and Germany. But in Russia, the steel duties were also seen as yet another humiliation, after disqualifications in the Olympic Games and talk of American troops in Georgia, one of Russia's least friendly neighbors -- despite Russia's support of America in its war against terrorists. 
 The tariffs affect about a third of Russia's steel exports and will cost this country $1.2 billion in revenue over the next three years, officials said today. Russia is the world's fourth-largest steel producer, and steel makes up a tenth of its total exports to the United States. 
Russia's trade and economic development minister, German O. Gref, called the sanctions "inappropriate," and said Russia might introduce retaliatory measures. But at a briefing later today, Mr. Gref's deputy, Maxim Medvedkov, said Russia would first seek legal justification for the sanctions from the United States. Both officials said the new tariffs violated two bilateral treaties.
A question mark, meanwhile, hung over Russia's ban on American poultry, which is set to begin March 10. Both Mr. Gref and Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov hinted this morning that Russia might be willing to repeal the ban on American meat -- two-thirds of Russia's supply last year.
But at a news conference later today, Russia's agriculture minister, Alexei V. Gordeyev, reiterated concerns that American poultry was full of additives. He was joined by the health minister, Yuri L. Shevchenko, who complained on Russian television that American birds cause "excessive weight, high blood pressure and other health complaints."
The ban, he added, "has nothing to do with any trade wars.
"It is just a move to ensure the health of the nation," Mr. Shevchenko continued.
The trade tensions come ahead of a planned summit meeting in May between President Vladimir V. Putin and Mr. Bush.
Steel duties have been a sore point in relations in the past. Russian officials say the government stopped handing out subsidies to the steel industry years ago -- subsidies that the United States says have helped distort the steel market. Mr. Putin is seeking membership in the World Trade Organization in part to be able to fight trade sanctions, like these steel duties, in an international forum.
While the nation was fuming about steel tariffs and joking about chicken parts -- even Mr. Kasyanov smiled slightly as he stumbled over the words at a news conference tonight in Kaliningrad -- government policy makers were reviewing what was ultimately at stake.
The products are significant exports for each country. Russia will lose $400 million a year through the new steel duties, while American farmers export about $600 million worth of poultry products to Russia annually, about 20 percent of its total exports to this country.
The United States ambassador to Russia, Alexander Vershbow, said at a briefing that Russian officials had ignored American requests to discuss concerns about the poultry, leading to the conclusion that the ban was "based more on protectionism than on legitimate safety concerns." Earlier in the day, Mr. Vershbow was summoned to Russia's foreign ministry to discuss Russian concerns about steel tariffs.
Officials here were vexed by a remark Tuesday by the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, linking the poultry ban to the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a 1974 economic sanction intended to pressure Communist-bloc nations to allow free emigration, particularly for Russian Jews. The amendment is obstructing Russia's entry to the World Trade Organization.
"The amendment was drawn up over restrictions on Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union; the question is, what does poultry have to do with it?" said Mikhail Margelov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Russia's upper house of Parliament, as quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax.
Steel producers were particularly irked by the tariffs since Russian steel exports to the United States have already plummeted by about three-quarters since 1999, when Russia agreed to restrictions to avoid American antidumping duties. That five-year trade agreement is still in force, producers said today, and new duties would mean America's unilateral withdrawal.
"Again losses, again searches for new markets," said Andrei Petrosyan, deputy general director of Novolipetsk Steel, Russia's No. 3 producer. "This is very serious."
Nine large steel companies, most of which are privately owned, produce about 85 percent of this country's steel and all of its exports. Managers of the companies say they have not received state subsidies since the mid-1990's and that they cannot afford to produce metal below cost, something American lobbyists accuse them of doing.
There was a bright spot. Novolipetsk, which last year exported 17 percent of its output to the United States, said its most important product, steel slabs, semifinished rolled steel ingots, will be helped by yesterday's measures. Slabs make up about 80 percent of the factory's revenue, and are its single biggest export to the United States.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
As recovery builds, the less educated go to the end of the employment line.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
"EVEN if the economy is on the road to recovery," Alan Greenspan warned last week, "the unemployment rate, in typical cyclical fashion, may resume its increase for a time." Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who will appear before the Senate Banking Committee today, did not mention that the lingering effects of high unemployment early in a recovery tend to be concentrated among the unskilled and minorities. This is true even though recessions are becoming more egalitarian.
 Such a pattern was evident in the early 1990's. The recession officially ended in March 1991, with the unemployment rate at 6.8 percent. But unemployment continued to rise for 15 months and did not settle below 6.8 percent again until the end of 1993. Moreover, the rate rose from 12.3 to 13.5 percent for high school dropouts in the year after the recession ended, while for college graduates it stayed at 2.9 percent. The "jobless recovery" mainly involved the less skilled. 
 In part, unemployment remains high after growth resumes simply because more people actively look for work if they think their prospects are better. Having more active job seekers and fewer discouraged workers is not a sign of weakness. For this reason, economists often prefer to focus on the employment-to-population rate -- the fraction of the population that is working.
Even with this measure, however, jobs often keep sliding after a recession ends. The employment rate did not hit bottom until nine months after the 1991 recession, and the slide was greater and lasted longer for less-skilled workers. The fraction of high school dropouts who were employed fell for three full years after the recession ended.
Jobs are slow to recover at the end of a recession because employers are not sure if improved conditions will persist, so they expand work hours rather than hire new employees. Many employers also "hoard" skilled workers during a downturn because it would be costly to hire and train replacements when conditions improve. Neither reason, however, accounts for why job growth is particularly sluggish for the less skilled when the economy picks up.
The economist Melvin Reder suggested a reason in 1955: in a downturn, many employers raise skill requirements for a given job, rather than cut pay. The less skilled thus find their job options even more limited until demand picks up smartly, while skilled workers take positions further down the job ladder.
Lawrence Katz of Harvard suggests another reason. "Think of a recession as a time when firms reorganize," he said. Reorganization tends to increase demand for skilled workers, who are more flexible. Furthermore, when companies introduce new technology as part of a reorganization, they tend to hire skilled workers to operate the equipment and release unskilled workers whose jobs are made redundant.
To some extent, the lingering pattern of unemployment after growth resumes, especially among the less skilled, is inadvertently reinforced by the major policy tool used to lift the economy out of recession -- interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. With a lag, rate cuts stimulate demand for new capital and consumer durables. But this is a two-edged sword for workers. On the one hand, a rise in economic activity increases the demand for all factors of production, including workers. On the other hand, because machinery is cheaper, many companies replace some workers with machines, or hire fewer workers, because the machines can do the work at lower cost.
What's more, capital -- especially high-technology equipment -- and skilled labor are complementary factors of production, while capital and unskilled workers can be substituted for each other. In other words, highly skilled workers are hired to operate and service new machines, while less-skilled workers are let go because the machines can do their work.
The current recession -- which many forecasters think may have already ended -- is shaping up as if it consists of two distinct phases distinguished by how skilled and unskilled workers fared. In the first phase, which lasted from March to July 2001, the employment-to-population rate fell for those with at least some college training, from 74.9 to 73.9 percent, while it actually increased slightly, from 55.1 to 55.3 percent, for those with a high school education or lower.
In the second phase -- the six months after July 2001 -- the opposite happened: the employment rate stopped falling for those with at least some college education, and dropped 1.7 percentage points for those with a high school education or lower.
A similar picture holds by race and ethnicity. At the beginning of the recession, the employment rate fell more for whites than for blacks and about the same for whites and Hispanics. Since July, however, employment has fallen more for blacks and Hispanics. Likewise, unemployment rose for whites in the first phase and held steady for blacks and Hispanics, while in the second phase unemployment is growing around twice as fast for blacks and Hispanics.
The egalitarian nature of the first phase came as a surprise but is consistent with the egalitarian tilt of the early 1990's recession. This phenomenon probably resulted from the plunge in capital investment that apparently precipitated the downturn, the implosion of many dot-coms and the fact that the cyclically sensitive manufacturing sector is much more skill intensive than it was 20 years ago.
It appears, however, that the egalitarian phase is over. If recent trends hold, job opportunities will rise or remain steady for the better educated and continue to contract for some time for the less educated and minorities.
The message to policy makers should be clear: to avoid another jobless recovery, stimulate demand for less-skilled workers. This suggests that policies that spur investment, like an accelerated capital depreciation allowance, may prove to be counterproductive; lower capital costs would increase demand for skilled workers but reduce demand for less-skilled workers.
Senator Pete V. Domenici's proposal for a temporary cut in the payroll tax, which is borne disproportionately by low-paid workers and their employers, would do much more to increase job growth.
Although many have argued that the opportunity or desirability for fiscal stimulus has ended, if the immediate goal is to avoid another jobless recovery, a temporary cut in the payroll tax still has much to offer, especially versus initiatives that would subsidize capital investment.

HEADLINE: Possible Deal Seen on Fuel Economy Measure in Senate 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 6 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain and a handful of other Republicans appeared to be close tonight to signing on to a modified proposal from Senate Democrats to raise federal fuel economy standards. An agreement would increase the measure's chances of survival as part of the Senate's energy bill. 
 Fuel economy standards have not been raised significantly since the 1980's, and the auto industry has been lobbying heavily against an increase by Congress. 
 A fuel economy proposal in the energy bill was co-sponsored by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, both Democrats, and called for a 50 percent increase in gas mileage for the average new automobile by the 2013 model year. In striking a compromise with Senator McCain, the proposal would require roughly the same mileage improvement by the 2015 model year as well as a trading system for greenhouse gas credits, according to people close to the negotiations. 
The credits could provide automakers with some leeway in reaching the goal. The compromise version would most likely also retain requirements for tougher safety standards for rollovers as well as requirements to design pickups and sport utility vehicles to be less of a threat to passenger cars during collisions. But it would still do away with the lower separate standards that now apply to pickups and sport utility vehicles.
Such legislation is unlikely to become law given the Republican House and White House, as well as opposition from some Midwestern Democrats. Even passage by the Senate is seen as a longshot, despite renewed concerns about dependence on foreign oil. 
Last week, General Motors held rallies at truck plants in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin against the Kerry-Hollings proposal. Company officials, as well as officials from Ford and Chrysler, have said that such a measure would have a catastrophic effect on the industry, lead to more than 100,000 lost jobs and could even lead to the extinction of pickups and sport utilities.
"It will do little or nothing for the environment but will do a hell of a lot to destroy American jobs," Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said during a G.M. rally at a truck plant in Pontiac, Mich.
Democrats and environmental groups have said that the auto industry made a similar argument when fuel standards were first proposed in the 1970's. 
"This is a job creator," Senator Kerry said during a recent news conference, arguing that the standards could push the Big Three to be more competitive with foreign automakers. Toyota and Honda have been more aggressive in pushing innovations like hybrid electric-gasoline engines. 
Senator Levin, one of the industry's closest allies, plans to introduce a proposal that would take the issue out of the hands of Congress. Instead, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department, would be given a timetable to make a decision. The auto industry has lobbied in the past against the agency's making the decision but would prefer that the agency handle it under the Bush administration. Andrew Card, a former top G.M. lobbyist, is President Bush's chief of staff. 
The auto industry thinks the compromises being made with Senator McCain will leave the bill little better than where it started. 
"A two-year extension does not solve the inherent problem that combining cars and trucks together, and then raising them by 50 percent, threatens the existence of S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickup trucks as we know them today," Stuart Schorr, a spokesman for DaimlerChrysler in Washington, said in an e-mail message.
In addition to Mr. McCain, Republican Senators who are said to be considering the proposal are Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Gordon Smith of Oregon.
The Bush administration has said that the Senate energy bill's fuel economy proposals are one of its flaws.
The proposal "would contribute to many thousands of additional passenger fatalities and injuries," according to a statement released by the Office of Management and Budget earlier this week. 
A study by the N.H.T.S.A. showed that reducing the weight of vehicles to increase fuel economy could also lead to hundreds of additional fatalities. But a more recent study, sponsored by Honda indicated that such reductions would not increase traffic fatalities and might even lower them.

PERSON: Hugh Morris Gloster 

HEADLINE: Hugh Gloster, 90, Ex-President of Morehouse 

 BODY:
Hugh Morris Gloster, who as president of the historically black Morehouse College greatly strengthened its endowment and faculty in the civil rights era, died on Feb. 16 in Decatur, Ga. He was 90.
 As Morehouse's seventh president and the first graduate to lead the school, he served from 1967 to 1986, as most predominantly black colleges faced new challenges as a result of the civil rights movement. Many previously all-white institutions began recruiting the best black students, forcing black colleges to compete while also facing the economic difficulties of the 70's. 
 Under Dr. Gloster's leadership at Morehouse, the campus doubled in size, as did the number of faculty members and their salaries. Faculty members holding Ph.D.'s increased to 65 percent of the total. Enrollment, meanwhile, doubled, and the endowment quadrupled to $29 million.
The fields of study were also increased, with the addition of an international studies program, a school of medicine and eight major fields in the department of business.
Dr. Gloster was also an author who often lectured on American literature and education. He wrote "Negro Voices in American Fiction," in print since 1948, and "My Life -- My Country -- My World" (1952) which became a standard anthology in college literature courses.
Hugh Morris Gloster was born May 11, 1911, in Brownsville, Tenn. He spent his early years in Memphis, where his father was a principal and teacher. After earning his bachelor's degree from Morehouse in 1931, he earned a master's degree from Atlanta University in 1933. He taught at LeMoyne-Owen College until 1941 and then at Morehouse until 1943, when he also earned a Ph.D. from New York University. He then worked for the United Service Organizations in Arizona and Atlanta.
At the Hampton Institute in Virginia, he rose to become the dean of faculty and helped the college raise $21 million. 
Dr. Gloster was a Fulbright professor of English at Hiroshima University in Japan and in the international educational exchange program at the University of Warsaw in Poland. He was also a member of several presidential commissions. 
Dr. Gloster was chosen by Benjamin Mays, the previous president of Morehouse, to succeed him, with the assent of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was on the board of trustees. 
Survivors include his wife of 45 years, Yvonne King Gloster; their daughters, Alice Burnette and Evelyn Dawkins; their son, Dr. Hugh M. Gloster Jr.; 4 stepchildren; 11 grandchildren; and 4 great-grandchildren.
"The tradition that Dr. Gloster helped create has benefited all black educational institutions," said Pat Swygert, president of Howard University, another top black college, who added that "the first two African-American presidents of Howard University, Mordecai Wyatt Johnson and James Nabrit Jr., were Morehouse men."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 12, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Thursday about Hugh Morris Gloster, former president of Morehouse College, omitted the names of his previous wives and misstated the length of his marriage to Yvonne Arnold King, who survives. Dr. Gloster's first marriage, to Louise Elisabeth Torrence, ended in divorce. In 1957 he married Beulah Victoria Harold, who died in 1985. Dr. Gloster and Ms. King were married in 1989, not 45 years ago.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Try Again for Bill on Tax Cut for Business 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, March 6 -- With evidence growing by the day that the recession is over, Republican leaders in the House made a last-ditch effort today to enact tax cuts for businesses this year by tying them to increased unemployment benefits.
 In their most serious effort yet to break a monthslong partisan deadlock, Republicans said they would bring to the House floor on Thursday a pared-down package of measures intended to help the economy, including tax breaks for companies that invest in new factories and equipment and a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits beyond the current 26-week limit. 
 The Democratic-controlled Senate has been pressing the House for weeks to give up on cutting taxes and pass an extension of unemployment benefits by itself. Democratic leaders said they were not sure whether the new House bill would lead to a bipartisan compromise. 
The maneuvering came as the Congressional Budget Office said today that the rapidly recovering economy should improve the federal budget outlook a bit but probably not enough to avoid deficits for at least the next few years.
The political calculus for both parties is changing along with the economic outlook.
Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said today that he would try to come up with a balanced budget plan for the next fiscal year, reflecting his party's reluctance to give up its self-appointed role as guardian of fiscal discipline. But Mr. Conrad said reaching his goal would require him to use the Bush administration's economic and technical assumptions about the budget, which are more optimistic than those of the Congressional Budget Office. 
"It's a heavy lift," Mr. Conrad said.
Representative Jim Nussle, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he had not ruled out a balanced budget for next year either. But he said his first priorities were to provide the money necessary to fight the war on terrorism, improve domestic security and put the economy on sound footing.
Nearly every economic indicator for the last few weeks has suggested that the economic downturn last year had given way to a robust recovery. Dan L. Crippen, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Senate Budget Committee today that the economy was "rebounding in a remarkable fashion."
Mr. Crippen said the strong pace of recovery should add more than $100 billion to the budget office's surplus estimate over the next decade, bringing it to $2.38 trillion.
The budget office projected that if Congress and the Bush administration made no changes to current tax or spending policy, the $2 trillion federal budget would eke out a $5 billion surplus this year and $6 billion next year. A little more than a month ago the budget office projected a $21 billion deficit for this year and a $14 billion deficit for next year.
But because spending increases are a foregone conclusion, and further tax cuts remain a possibility, those surpluses are all but certain to disappear. 
President Bush is about to ask for more money for the war on terrorism. Both parties have long lists of spending requests for years to come. Extending unemployment benefits would cost $8.5 billion this year, and if the two parties agreed on the full package of economic measures to be taken up by the House on Thursday, it would cost $51 billion this year.
White House officials said the new budget projections were evidence that the tax cut pushed through Congress last year by President Bush was helping the economy and gradually restoring the budget surplus.
But House Republicans said the plan they would bring to the floor on Thursday would do much less for the economy than the three previous economic packages they had passed since last fall, all of which have been blocked in the Senate.
The decision by Republicans to drop some of the more contentious provisions of their package -- most notably an acceleration of planned income tax rate reductions -- reflected a growing consensus within the party that time may be running out for delivering on their promise of tax cuts for business.
Twice in recent months, the Senate has unanimously passed extensions of unemployment insurance, a step routinely agreed to by both parties in past recessions. Democrats have been putting increasing pressure on Republicans in the House to decouple their demand for tax cuts from the unemployment insurance extension, saying that hundreds of thousands of people a month are exhausting their unemployment benefits before they can find a new job.
Although the economy is growing again, unemployment tends to continue rising for at least the first several months of a recovery, and so far the historical pattern seems to be repeating itself in this business cycle.
The new House bill would allow businesses to write off an additional 30 percent of their investments in new factories and equipment for the next three years, a step intended to address one of the weakest aspects of the economy. 
The House bill would also create tax breaks for rebuilding lower Manhattan and extend a variety of longstanding deductions and credits that expired at the end of last year.
In addition to stripping out some of the tax cuts previously sought by Republicans, it would also drop a provision championed by Democrats, a one-time payment of up to $300 for low- and middle-income workers who did not get a rebate under the tax cut signed into law last year by President Bush.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "FORECAST: Budget Benchmark Returns to Black"The Congressional Budget Office's new estimates of the baseline budget surplus, which assumes no changes in taxes or spending, project a small surplus in this fiscal year and next, instead of the deficits seen in January, because of the improved economic outlook. But any surplus is all but certain to be consumed by new spending and the possibility of further tax cuts. Graph shows January and March figures for projections of 2003-2007.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Anew report says ad spending in major media fell 9.8 percent last year, more than first thought.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott and Allison Fass 

 BODY:
ADVERTISING activity in major media fell even more than had been feared last year, according to a report released yesterday by a company that tracks ad spending by marketers.
 Still, life goes on for Madison Avenue, particularly as signs begin to emerge of a nascent recovery in ad spending. Indeed, two large advertisers are making decisions on their accounts, with combined spending estimated at $160 million to $175 million. 
 The tracking company, CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, reported that ad spending in major media fell 9.8 percent last year, to $94.3 billion, in contrast to a record $104.5 billion in 2000. Estimates of the decline in ad spending last year had previously ranged from 4 percent to 8 percent for media outlets like national television, newspapers, radio, magazines and outdoor. 
"Looking back, 2001 was an extraordinary year for the advertising industry," said David Peeler, president and chief executive at CMR in New York, because of the dot-com bust as well as "the downward turn in the economy, budget cuts, agency consolidations and the tremendous cuts in television advertising in the days following Sept. 11."
National newspapers suffered the largest decline in ad revenue last year among the major media, according to the report, down 23 percent. Of the 12 categories tracked by CMR, 2 had spending gains: cable television, up 1 percent, and nationally syndicated TV programs, up 0.1 percent.
General Motors remained the largest American advertiser in 2001, CMR reported, spending almost $2.2 billion. That was despite G.M.'s cutting of its ad budget by 25.4 percent, the largest percentage drop of any advertiser in the top 10. Other advertisers that significantly reduced their ad budgets included Philip Morris, at $1.38 billion, down 23.4 percent, and DaimlerChrysler, at $1.39 billion, down 17.3 percent.
Other estimates of ad spending for 2001 are scheduled to be released in the spring. That data will include spending in media not tracked by CMR, like direct marketing and Internet advertising.
Turning to the advertisers that made decisions on their accounts, one was the Wachovia Corporation and the other was the California State Lottery.
Wachovia, the nation's fourth-largest bank, will consolidate its account, with combined spending estimated at $60 million to $75 million, at Mullen/LHC, an office of Mullen in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Wachovia was acquired in 2001 by First Union, which for the last six years used Publicis & Hal Riney in San Francisco, part of the Publicis Groupe. Before then, Wachovia used, also for six years, Mullen/LHC, formerly known as Long Haymes Carr. The combined company operates under the Wachovia name.
The consolidation of accounts came after a six-week "shootout" between Riney and Mullen/LHC, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to determine which would be the agency of record for the combined company. With the decision, Riney has lost its second major account in five weeks, coming after the agency was dismissed by the Saturn division of General Motors.
Mullen/LHC "matched us as far as chemistry, cultural fit and creative ideas," said Shika Raynor, a spokeswoman for Wachovia in Charlotte, N.C. 
Erwin-Penland in Greenville, S.C., will continue handling secondary advertising assignments for Wachovia.
As for the California lottery, its account is being placed in review again, two months after lottery officials tentatively named a new agency. Spending was estimated at $100 million for a four-year contract.
The move came after the incumbent agency for five years, the Los Angeles office of Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, protested the decision to award the contract provisionally to the Los Angeles office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, claiming that the review had been mishandled.
"During the course of the protest some facts came to light," said Jim Hasegawa, marketing director at the lottery in Sacramento, concerning the omission of required information from the agencies listing the names of executives at the sibling shops that would handle the media buying duties for the account. For DDB, that would be OMD, and for Grey, that would be MediaCom.
As a result, Mr. Hasegawa said, "it's in the lottery's best interest and the public's best interest" to review the account again.
David Park, chief executive at DDB Los Angeles, described the agency as frustrated and disappointed, but added, "We'll go along with whatever their rulings are -- we must -- with a smile on our face."
Another request for agencies to submit proposals will be sent within a month, Mr. Hasegawa said. The contract with Grey expires on June 30. Both Grey and DDB are expected to take part in the second review.

HEADLINE: MY MANHATTAN; 
Like Italy, Only Not Far Away

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LOURIE; Richard Lourie's latest book, "Sakharov: A Biography," is being published this month.

 BODY:
The Italians invented hanging out. The design of their towns and cities draws people together. Once, outside a train station in a small Italian town, I observed this scene: There was one customer in the outdoor cafe. A second arrived, scanned the dozen or so tables, then sat at a table next to the one already occupied. That probably would not have happened in the United States, except in places like Carmine Street in Greenwich Village, where the old traditions still live, even as they morph into more modern form.
 Carmine Street is in many ways exceptional, even eccentric. Unlike most streets in the Mondrianesque parallelogram of Manhattan, Carmine does not run east-west or north-south but cuts at an angle from Seventh Avenue to the Avenue of the Americas. It is only three blocks long. Both of those facts define its nature. 
 It is an obvious shortcut from one avenue to the next and yet, because it is so short, it never accumulated any of the piercing-and-bong-shop tackiness of Bleecker Street, which it intersects briefly and obliquely before emptying like a small tributary into the Avenue of the Americas. It's a village within the Village. 
It is best seen, and entered, from Seventh Avenue. From there it has the aspect of a pleasant street in a minor European city -- trees, awnings, sidewalk stands in all but the worst of weather, the copper oxidized green dome and cross of Our Lady of Pompei both anchoring and elevating the view. Perfect for a watercolor.
Its length makes it ideal for strolling and its one side street, Bedford, invites exploration with its minuscule cafes, unusual stores and a nearby chic restaurant, which is all alone on a residential block. Of course, like nearly everything else, Carmine Street is best enjoyed in lovely weather, but there is another aspect of the street that makes it appealing even on frigid days. Its smallness creates cozy intimacy, hominess. It is there in the easy ambience of the small shops cheek by jowl, some plain and utilitarian, some exotic like the East Corner Company, which has lovely treasures from the dynasties of China, and in the cuisine of its many restaurants, mostly a mix of traditional Italian and trendier Asian.
It is a real Greenwich Village street, not one tarted up for tourists. This is a difference that might be defined as that between a street with shoe stores and a street with only a cobbler. The cobbler of Carmine Street is Misha or Mike, depending on which nickname you prefer, who is from Odessa, Russia's Brooklyn. A stream of emigres from the former Soviet Union have passed through Magic Shoe Repair, shining shoes, working their way into America with a rag, polish and hungry energy. Like all Odessans, everything reminds Misha of a joke. But he transplants not only jokes from Russia, but tomatoes as well, and he becomes suddenly rapt and poetic as he describes their skin -- delicate, pale red -- the juicy plumpness within. 
But Misha's reverie is interrupted by a gleaming black Jaguar that pulls up in front of his store. A long-legged supermodel emerges. She's a regular customer and the banter begins at once, reaching a particularly sprightly pace when she is seated on the shoeshine chair and Misha is fitting her midcalf-high elegant boots, an experience certainly superior to selling a pair of shoelaces. And then she is gone like the kiss she blows at the door. A sudden windfall of beauty, grace, the excitement of celebrity and the great world. Carmine Street may be cozy and enclosed but this is still, after all, Manhattan. 
The heart of the little community of Carmine Street is the intersection with Bleecker, formed by Joe's Pizza and Father Demo Square, Our Lady of Pompei and Trattoria Spaghetto. Joe's is a no-nonsense joint if "nonsense" means tables. You can eat standing up or take your food to go. 
Either way, it's well worth it, pizza that is both genuine and tasty, the slices that New Yorkers transplanted to other states can only dream of. Most of the year, a good portion of the slices are consumed in Father Demo Square; though improvements are to be made, it is an undistinguished square of paving, benches and scraggly trees frequented by pensioners, pigeons and assorted urban jetsam. Though essentially wedged into the Avenue of the Americas, it still manages to provide a small miracle of tranquillity. 
The church was itself founded in 1927, replacing St. Benedict the Moor, which had served black residents until they were replaced by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century. But even before this, when the neighborhood residents were predominantly black, the street was at times integrated: Aaron Burr resided at property he owned there and the poet William Cullen Bryant lived there, as did Edgar Allan Poe (at a perfect address for him: 113 1/2).
The streets and the church are integrated again. That the church is a living institution I had occasion to witness while reading historical material that a woman in the rectory office had given me. Suddenly, the door opened and a handsome middle-aged woman in a fur coat entered, her eyes glistening with high emotion.
"I tried the church door and it was locked," she said.
By way of explanation, the woman in the rectory said, "They're working in there now." 
The first woman said: "But I really need to be in church! I really need it!" 
To which she was told, "Follow me."
In the window of Trattoria Spaghetto is a thank you note from the children of Our Lady of Pompei School for "helping us maintain high standards." That would seem to indicate that the school and the restaurant are knit together in the same community, but that impression would be illusory. The street has been largely de-Italianated. Nearly all the students in the parochial school are bused in. The families who made this an Italian street, even, said one resident, 90 percent Sicilian, are long gone to the suburbs.
There are very few left from the old days who can still remember when the Avenue of the Americas ended just a little south of Carmine, when the street was cobbled and rang with the wheels of peddlers' horse-drawn carts and the movies were all black-and-white. But there are a few last Mohicans and they preserve the honorable tradition of dolce far niente, sitting or standing around, talking; in a word, hanging out.
Where the old-timers congregate is determined by the precise position of the sun. In the blaze of summer they seek out the shade of a playground in a courtyard invisible from the street. In the more temperate weather they will move their metal folding chairs out onto the sidewalk, every day a parade if you know how to look. As the Earth tilts away from the sun in autumn, they move across the street on Carmine to enjoy the best of the scant rays on the church steps. 
But no matter where they are, the same rules apply: the talk must be fast, vigorous, jokey, argumentative, anything but boring. The group is exclusively male, with five to eight men, though sometimes a woman will drift over for a time and she is always treated with gallantry both while she is there and after she is gone. 
The subject of the conversations can range from an argument about what restaurant was there before the last two to the fine points of a boxer with the marvelous name Unknown Winston. Someone might recall the peddler who sold fruit off a wagon or their memories might be considerably more contemporary because some of them, having moved to the church step side on Sept. 11, had a clear vision of the Avenue of the Americas as a passenger jet roared over it low heading due south. 
Carmine Street may be something of a place apart, but it is still part of Lower Manhattan and its economic blood is only slowly rebuilding its strength. As the owner of the Magic Carpet restaurant said, "People are going to restaurants less and to Middle Eastern restaurants even less." 
A shame because the spinach pie there is especially subtle and the Saturday belly dancer is especially sinuous and is not of the overly fleshy sort perhaps because she is Norwegian by extraction. But that fits just right on Carmine Street, where the Chinese manager of the Village Laundry and Cleaner speaks with a Caribbean accent, pure smiling Calypso.
Though the old-timers still wield a certain proprietary authority, it is not their street anymore. As one of them, who has lived for almost seven decades on Carmine Street, says with an amazement that is both good-humored and tragic, "I'm a stranger on the block."
Now it belongs to the young people who have inundated the neighborhood. It is they who frequent the Unoppressive Nonimperialist Bargain Books store whose remainders lean to Kerouac and Eastern Zen masters. The store is not, however, antiexpansionist, having just taken over the shop next door to make a children's book annex.
It is the young who patronize Evergreen, one of the best video stores anywhere and the several vinyl-only stores; it is they who pack the Grey Dog's Coffee restaurant for its zesty stews and soups and the new restaurant, Deborah, which some days posts this notice: "Life is too short to eat bad food with unhappy people." They also favor the Asian restaurants like Yama because the food is exotic, low in calories, hip and healthful. Do Hwa, a Korean restaurant, has united two of the street's new aspects and has a D.J. sampling vinyl in the bar area, though not everyone will find kimchee and hip-hop the most auspicious combination. 
The youth culture of Carmine Street is bohemian in an easy, natural, even somehow wholesome way; few flaunt tattoos, whose bearers have no idea that in time those colors will run like Sunday comics left out in the rain. (Inks may have improved but flesh hasn't.) Though de Kooning lived here for a time, the street feels more like a musicians' than a painters' quarter. 
Music flows out of vinyl stores and people are usually on stools testing out some chords in Carmine Street Guitars, a building, one of three in a row, that dates from the 1820's, where stringed instruments by the dozen are suspended from the ceiling, angels in guitar heaven. 
The demographics are more mixed in the Italian restaurants like Trattoria Spaghetto, Cent'Anni, Marinella and Nostro Sapore. Some of the clientele are from other parts of Manhattan out for some Village Italian, the nice little place on a quiet side street. There are always out-of-towners seduced by guide-book prose. Some diners are from the old neighborhood, back in the city for one reason or another, who feel it a shame not to go back, walk around, have something to eat. Nostalgia and red sauce. 
Carmine Street is still changing. Twenty years from now one of today's vinyl-and-video neo-Beats may be deriding the SoHo-ization of Carmine Street, able to remember when it was still good little stores and interesting places to eat. One resident of the neighborhood, Karen Kramer, is making an epic effort to capture local history on film in a documentary, "The Ballad of Greenwich Village," which spans the whole history from 1811, when New York decided to adopt the grid system of streets and Greenwich Village declined to participate in anything so rectilinear -- that is, square -- to the present. She fights the classic battle of the documentarian, scratching for dollars even as people and places vanish, a cafe folds, a poet dies. 
For now it is the old-timers by the church steps who keep the past alive and the pace fast and furious: "No, that wasn't Unknown Winston; it was another guy. What's his name? What the hell is his name?"

HEADLINE: Notes From Fayetteville; 
North Carolina Under Friendly Fire

BYLINE:  By Catherine Lutz; Catherine Lutz, author of "Homefront: A Military City and the American 20th Century," is a professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina.

DATELINE: FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. 

 BODY:
At a quiet rural crossroads 25 miles northwest of the Army's Fort Bragg, a local lawman shot two soldiers on a Special Forces training exercise two weeks ago Saturday, killing one. The deputy feared for his life when the soldiers -- dressed in flannel shirts and jeans and failing to identify themselves -- grabbed for an automatic rifle in their bag. The soldiers wrongly assumed that the sheriff was in Pineland with them, Pineland being the imaginary country where these exercises have taken place over the last 50 years.
 By the Army's and most locals' accounting, the problem was a simple miscommunication. But the accident raises questions about the size and scale, invisibility, and day-to-day home-front impact of America's military -- the largest armed force the world has ever seen. 
 I first became aware of Pineland while researching Fayetteville, a city just to the east of Fort Bragg. Pineland has been imagined in great anthropological detail for use in these war games, its "country guide" describing a parallel universe to Fayetteville. Pineland has a small elite, a hospitable culture and struggling, honest poor folks with hearts and minds ready to be won. The report provides cultural advice for soldiers to avoid alienating the locals, as well as contact information for friendlies. In the war game's standard scenario, American forces assist a rebel David in overthrowing a tyrannous Goliath and liberating Pineland -- a kind of miniature American Revolution.
Beneath this imaginary plot lie very different stories of what United States forces have done in Guatemala, Vietnam or El Salvador, where the scenario has been different: propping up unpopular governments or assisting local militaries and paramilitaries in terrorizing civilians. And beneath Pineland's imaginary geography in North Carolina there are some complicated real places. They include Fayetteville, close to the vast fort's barracks side, and 10 rural counties, on the opposite boundary, where the games are mainly played.
Like many in military cities, Fayetteville's people mainly get by on low-paying retail jobs selling bath mats, tattoos or movie tickets to soldiers. Unemployment is high as residents tread water in a labor pool enlarged by military spouses and teenagers, and they cope with municipal budgets weakened by the fort's tax-free land and post-exchange shopping. The challenge to democracy comes not from the shadowy figures of Pineland but from low voter-registration rates -- most soldiers retain residency in their hometowns.
At the same time, soldiers are paid on a very egalitarian wage scale, which makes for a substantial middle class, and the city is more diverse than most in the South. That is the legacy of a century of war and an empire of American bases: French, German, Korean, Okinawan and Filipino floats all go by in the city's annual International Folk Festival. The pioneers in these groups probably came as spouses, but then relatives arrived and new communities grew.
The military mission here trumps all other public concerns and institutions. Political leaders around Fort Bragg have complained, to no avail, about jets that fly so low over some neighborhoods that children can see the pilots in their cockpits.
Playing the roles of Pineland's people does not pay a wage. Most in the area feel they are making a patriotic contribution when their land is used as a training ground and they become used to armed men with camo-painted faces appearing in their backyards. (The exercises are held four times a year, with about 100 soldiers participating each time.) When I visited recently, the men and women at the convenience store in Robbins talked about the accident and then switched to the recent shuttering of the town's furniture plant, hosiery mill and trailer factory. As jobs disappear, the Special Forces will have fewer hearts and minds to practice on in Pineland, and the student-soldiers may come across more bitter people like the man I met a few miles from Robbins. He was flying two large Confederate battle flags in front of his auto-repair yard and a sign that read, "This is not Mexico." His messages flew in the face of his Latino neighbors who work at the local Perdue plant, which has gone from three shifts to one.
War remains a hygienic fantasy for most Americans. The real costs of war and war preparations in lives and communities, at home or abroad, can remain distant from our everyday experience. The hollowing out of the real communities underneath Pineland reminds me of what Dwight Eisenhower said nearly 50 years ago, around the time when the Special Forces games first began under a cloud of apprehension about foreign attack. Watching the growing military budget and the effect of military industries on government, he feared the "great influence, almost an insidious penetration of our own minds that the only thing this country is engaged in is weaponry." As our current president proposes monumental increases in military expenditures and the numbers of the poor grow in Fort Bragg's shadow, Eisenhower's fears should be our own as well.

HEADLINE: More Graduates Mired in Debt, Survey Finds 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
Two out of 3 students must now borrow money to attend college, and 4 out of 10 face unmanageable debts as they finish college and enter the job market, according to a report released today.
 The report, by the lobbying arm of State Public Interest Research Groups, a nonprofit organization that studies social policy, found that debt among students doubled between 1992 and 2000, when the average graduate left college owing nearly $17,000 in educational loans. The figures are not adjusted for inflation, which remained low in that period. 
 Tracey King, an author of the report, said that higher education remained "a great investment," increasing a graduate's income over the course of a lifetime by more than $1 million. 
"At the same time," Ms. King said, "students are having a hard time when they're graduating with all this debt and the payments are a high percentage of their income."
The report, based on data from the Census Bureau and the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, found that the share of students borrowing to finance their education rose substantially, to 59 percent in 1996 from 42 percent in 1992. During that period, federal financing through Pell grants shrank as tuition rose. 
Though Pell grants increased after 1996, the educational debt of graduating seniors jumped to $16,928 in 2000 from $9,188 in 1992.
A third of students graduate owing more than $20,000 in education loans, and nearly half of all student borrowers graduate with credit card debts that average $3,176. By 2000, 64 percent of students relied on loans to help finance their education.
The report defines an unmanageable educational debt as one draining more than 8 percent of a person's monthly income. The report said this was a standard definition used by the loan industry.
Alyssa Ferree, a student at the University of California at Davis, said she had hoped to become a teacher or a social worker after graduating in 2004 with a degree in community and regional development. In California, New York and elsewhere in the country, school systems face a severe shortage of teachers, and the recruitment of fresh talent has been a priority of policy makers.
But with her student loans set to reach $15,000 by graduation day, Ms. Ferree said she would have to aim for a better paying job after leaving college. 
"When I entered college I knew I'd have debt," Ms. Ferree said, "but I didn't expect it to be this much."

HEADLINE: If Jobs Are Gone for Good, What Good Are Benefits? 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: SOUTH BOSTON, Va., March 1 

 BODY:
For 13 years, Amy Altman worked at the JPS Apparel Fabrics plant here, and wound up earning $9.50 an hour. With production grinding toward a halt early last year, she began working one week on and one off, and on the off weeks she collected a $224 unemployment check. When the plant closed on Aug. 1, letting 346 workers go, the checks continued.
But in October, they stopped. Her eligibility, limited to six months, had expired. Creditors phoned. "When would I pay?" she recalls them asking. "Did I know I was late? I had nothing to pay nothing with." 
 Ms. Altman, 42, a divorced mother of two grown children, filed for bankruptcy. The judge let her keep her mobile home and her 1992 Chevrolet Cavalier, its blue paint rubbing off. Since moving in with her fiance, a 27-year veteran of JPS who has found work driving trucks, she has put the mobile home and its half-acre of land up for sale. She is asking $39,000. 
 The unemployment insurance program that ran out for Ms. Altman, just as it has run out for hundreds of thousands of other Americans since the onset of the recession that hit in early 2001, has been around for 67 years, as long as welfare. It was conceived as a lifeline to pull laid-off workers through recessions, granting them cash until their jobs came back or they found new ones, for a maximum of 26 weeks. In the last five recessions before this one, Congress routinely extended benefits, to 39 weeks. A bill passed by the House on Thursday would do so again. 
But even as Congress moves toward an extension this time around, a larger question about the program remains: whether for many beneficiaries, including hundreds here in this industrial string of towns in far southern Virginia, it still works as intended.
Previously, factories in this part of the country weathered recessions by reducing the work force and then bringing employees back when the economy revived. This time, however, the plants are shutting down, for good, leaving no jobs to bring workers back to.
Even as the national economy shows signs of rebounding, jobs here are leaving faster than they are coming, bloating welfare rolls as the tally of unemployed workers who have exhausted their benefits grows.
Unemployment in this area exceeds 10 percent, the level of a deep recession and almost twice the national rate. In Martinsville, it is 20 percent. In Danville, the area's biggest town, the number of laid-off workers jumped to 5,160 last December from 1,680 the December before.
What new jobs there are, in fields like warehousing and telemarketing, pay less than the old ones: $6 to $10 an hour (as against $9 to $15), or about what people laid off from the old jobs collect in unemployment benefits.
Small furniture companies have closed in all these towns. In Clarksville, the Russell Stover candy plant has also shut down this winter, eliminating 700 jobs. But it is the closing of textile and apparel factories that has done the most damage. 
In January, Burlington Industries said it would permanently shut four American plants, including one in Clarksville and another in nearby Halifax. Just over two years ago, the Tultex Corporation, then the biggest employer in Martinsville, filed for bankruptcy, shutting plants there and in South Boston, with the loss of 2,400 jobs. This year Vanity Fair Imagewear, which employs 2,300 people near Martinsville, is closing. 
In most cases, the reason is competition from foreign goods. With adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement nine years ago acting as a spur, more and more shirts, dresses and cloth are being imported rather being churned out here. 
"More imports have meant more exhaustion of unemployment benefits," said Joyce Snead, manager of the Virginia Employment Commission's office in Martinsville. "It's a bad situation. It truly is. It is getting worse and more frightening."
Helping qualified workers apply for benefits and look for jobs is taxing Ms. Snead's office. She said she had asked the state to add five more counselors to her 32. 
"Unless the economic development people can turn things around, it's going to become even more difficult than it is now," she said. "We have gone from having 350 jobs posted on a weekly basis six months ago to less than 100." 
To get any of those 100, candidates must often ratchet down their standard of living. 
At the State Employment Commission office in South Boston, Linda Miles, 24, separated mother of three children, said she lost her Burlington job in January. It paid $9.35 an hour. She searched the office's computer for new jobs, and made a list of three: phlebotomist, $6 an hour; general warehouse worker, $6.90; cashier, $6. 
Ms. Miles's estranged husband pays her rent, but she has no unemployment benefits to fall back on: she had not worked long enough and earned enough to qualify. She is unwilling to leave the area, and without a job here, her last resort is welfare. 
She is not alone. In Danville's welfare office, Frederic Fraley, the manager, said the decline in caseloads after the overhaul of the nation's welfare system six years ago had reversed as the number of layoffs rose. In January, he had 601 cases, up from 531 a year earlier. 
Betty Wells, manager of the welfare office in Halifax, said her welfare cases grew by 22 percent in the latter half of 2001, and her food stamp cases 21 percent.
"That doesn't include all that's coming," said Mrs. Wells, who has been touched personally by the plant closings. After 30 years at the Burlington plant in Halifax, where he earned more than $15 an hour as a mechanical planner, her 53-year-old husband was let go in January.
There are government-paid job-training programs, but workers with 20 or 30 years' grounding in a single industrial skill tend to resist. Ollie Spencer, a counselor in Ms. Snead's office, said: "They will say to us, 'I was a good worker. Someone will want to hire me.' We tell them, 'Sure, go ahead, but if you're interested in training, we'll help.' "
People can also move. But many were born and raised here, and leaving would mean shedding the emotional and financial support of family and friends. Some are rooted to the land. 
James M. Parrish Sr., 56, was a mechanic for seven years at the JPS plant, where he earned $13.65 an hour. "I've got a double-wide on 25 acres of land half-owned with my ex-wife," he said. He also has 10 cows and 15 registered coon hounds for hunting. 
He is going to Southside Virginia Community College to learn to fix computers, but he is not going to move. 
"I've got animals I have to feed," he said.

HEADLINE: McCall Campaign Won't Pay for Israel Trip 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller running for governor, returned from a three-day trip to Israel yesterday, called a news conference to recount his impressions of Israel, and held out the possibility that his campaign would pick up part of the cost of the trip, a visit that could enhance his candidacy among Jewish voters in New York.
 But barely an hour after he finished telling reporters about his trip, Mr. McCall's office rolled back and announced that the costs would, in fact, be paid almost entirely by the New York State pension fund and by State of Israel Bonds, an organization that promotes economic development in Israel. The McCall campaign, an aide said, would cover only the cost of bumping up the comptroller from coach to first class on his El Al flight. 
 The back-and-forth occurred on a day when Mr. McCall returned from his trip at 7 a.m. and, within seven hours, called a news conference at his Manhattan office -- with a telephone link-up to reporters across the state -- to discuss his observations and to recount his meetings with Israeli leaders, among them Ariel Sharon, the prime minister, and Shimon Peres, the foreign minister.
The state comptroller, who is battling Andrew M. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination to challenge Gov. George E. Pataki, asserted that in visiting Israel, he was acting as the chief custodian of the state's pension fund. Mr. McCall said he wanted to personally inspect the projects that had benefited from his investment of $68 million from the fund into State of Israel Bonds.
"I go, whether it's Buffalo or Hong Kong or wherever we have invested money," Mr. McCall said. "I did this on behalf of my role as the sole trustee of the pension fund. And it is my responsibility, if we are investing money in any particular area or region or project, it is important to see the results of these investments."
But Mr. McCall's itinerary included a stop by the Western Wall in Jerusalem, public appearances with Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn, who represents one of the most heavily Jewish districts in New York, and a visit to a Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The settlement, while including a number of Jews from New York, has not benefited from any expenditures of New York State pension funds, Mr. McCall said.
And he acknowledged that the trip might afford some political benefit to a candidate running for office in New York, where Jewish voters make up a large segment of Democratic primary voters. (His aides aggressively pushed for coverage of the trip in New York newspapers.)
And in response to a question, he seemed receptive, at least momentarily, to the notion that his campaign might pay at least some of the costs of the trip, during which he was accompanied by three aides. "Maybe we will," Mr. McCall said, adding: "I don't know. We'll get all the bills and see what they are. And maybe we'll do that. I just haven't decided."
The decision was reached quickly. Reporters returning to their desks yesterday afternoon were greeted with phone calls from Mr. McCall's press secretary saying there was no reason for campaign funds to pay for this trip.
"There was no campaigning involved," said Steven Greenberg, the press secretary. "The comptroller was there in his role as the sole custodian of the fund."
Mr. Greenberg said the cost of the trip would be divided, almost evenly, between the Common Retirement Fund, which is financed by the pension contributions of New York State workers, and State of Israel Bonds. Mr. Greenberg was unable to provide a cost estimate. He also said he did not know how much the campaign would have to pay to cover upgrading Mr. McCall's ticket.
Mr. McCall is hardly alone in taking an international trip that might provide domestic political benefits. Mr. Pataki has gone to Israel, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, all at taxpayers' expense. Mr. Cuomo has gone to the Dominican Republic -- the former housing secretary is, at least temporarily, not on a government payroll, so his campaign paid most of that expense.
Although Mr. McCall said such overseas inspection trips were usual for him, his aides were unable to note another time when he had returned and immediately called a news conference to draw attention to his voyage. And in truth, Mr. McCall devoted nearly five days in travel to inspecting what amounts to a minuscule portion of the pension portfolio that he controls: just $68 million out of $112 billion.
Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager, Josh Isay, denounced Mr. McCall for using state money to pay for the trip, describing it as evidence of what was wrong in Albany. "We need to end business as usual," he said.
Mr. McCall asserted that his visit to the West Bank settlement was critical to help him appreciate the struggles of the country. "These are controversial, and a lot of people advised me not to go to the settlements," he said "But I thought it was important for me to go because I needed to understand the movement. Who were the people who were there? Why were they there?"
"It was good to let them know of my concern, and my solidarity with them -- most of them former New Yorkers, particularly from Brooklyn," he said.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates Increase 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
Mortgage rates around the country climbed this week as investors, looking at evidence that a recovery has begun, raised the odds that the Federal Reserve might increase short-term interest rates later this year. 
 Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, reported that the average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.87 percent, from 6.80 the previous week, according to the company's nationwide survey released today. Fifteen-year mortgages, which are a popular option for refinancing, rose to 6.37 percent, up from 6.28 percent the week before. 
 On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 5.07 percent, up from 4.94 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SURVIVAL; 
Children as Barter in a Famished Land

BYLINE:  By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: KANGORI, Afghanistan, March 2 

 BODY:
Haunted by want, depleted from hunger, Akhtar Muhammad first sold off his few farm animals and then, as the months passed, bartered away the family's threadbare rugs and its metal cooking utensils and even some of the wooden beams that held up the hard-packed roof of his overcrowded hovel.
 But always the hunger outlasted the money. And finally, six weeks ago, Mr. Muhammad did something that has become ruefully unremarkable in this desperate country. He took two of his 10 children to the bazaar of the nearest city and traded them for bags of wheat. 
 Gone now from his home are the boys, Sher, 10, and Baz, 5. "What else could I do?" the bereft father asked today in Kangori, a remote hamlet in the mountains of northern Afghanistan. He did not want to seem uncaring. "I miss my sons, but there was nothing to eat," he said, casting a glance sideways to prove that his misery was hardly unusual. 
In the nearby foothills, enfeebled people were coming back from foraging wild spinach and even blades of grass -- a harvest of hideously bitter greenery that can be made edible only if boiled long enough. "For some, there is nothing else," Mr. Muhammad muttered.
Afghanistan, cradle of tragedy, is now in its fourth year of drought, and with the drought has come its inevitable offspring, famine. The hungry, spiraling deathward, try to cope in pitiable ways, selling all, eating fodder, wandering away to beg.
Yet a measure of solace accompanies the abundance of despair. Last fall, when American bombing raids hindered emergency food deliveries, humanitarian groups were concerned about mass starvation. As winter comes to a close, the famine has not proved as lethal as feared, leaving millions in the vicinity of the grave without quite pushing them in.
"Always, in any situation like this, people are going to die, but we've done a lot to minimize the loss of life," said Alejandro Chicheri, a spokesman for the World Food Program of the United Nations. "If there is starvation, it's only in small pockets." 
The World Food Program and various aid groups are generally credited for a laudable mobilization. Wheat -- and occasionally beans and cooking oil -- have been distributed to 6.5 million Afghans, the goods sometimes sent in a relay from trucks to camels to donkeys. 
This charity has kept huge numbers from a final spill into nothingness.
"It's really quite weird," said an aid worker, Christopher S. F. Petch. "You go to places where people are only eating bread made out of barley and grass. The people don't look good and they don't look strong. But they also don't look skeletal. They are managing."
It is hard to estimate how many lives hunger has recently claimed. The situation is complex, and information incomplete. This is not a nation of record-keepers. Besides, hunger is often an indirect killer, letting disease provide the finishing blow.
In Afghanistan, two decades of war have also left it hard to distinguish between the bad times and the worse. Even without famine, more than one in five children die before the age of 5 and the average life expectancy is a mere 44.
The largest of the unanswered questions are complicated by topography.
Hundreds of villages are far from roads, tucked away in steep ravines and mammoth peaks, cut off further by snow. Some Afghans are several days journey from any site of food distribution.
What has happened to the isolated? 
"We call them internally stuck people," said Ahmed Idrees Rahmani of the International Rescue Committee. "Wherever the roads stop, disaster seems to start. Reaching some villages requires 4-5 days on a donkey. People might be starving. We wouldn't know."
Kangori, in Sar-i-Pol Province, is a modest village of mud-walled dwellings that seem to blend seamlessly into the parched, unyielding earth. It is a three-hour walk through rolling hills to Sholgarah, the nearest town of any size, and that has proved an impossible distance for some. The old, the infirm and the morose are paralyzed with deprivation.
Not all in Kangori are suffering, however. Ajab Khan, a prosperous shepherd, provided a welcoming hand and an energetic tour of the sickly and dispossessed.
"Look, she is eating the grass," he said at the first stop, introducing a frail woman who was sitting near her only food, a bowl of weeds. "She has nothing, nothing at all."
The woman, Gul Shah, said she had sent her five children out to gather more wild greens from the landscape. For her, Sholgarah, where wheat was once given away, might as well be Timbuktu. "How would I know when or where there is free food?" she said.
Mr. Khan then directed the way to someone even more pitiful. "I can show you a woman whose husband and two children died of hunger," he said, pacing toward another hovel.
There sat Khali Gul, a tearful woman with a bowl of grass at her feet and nearby a young daughter whose face was blemished with sores. She said her family had become foragers two months before and now seemed to be succumbing one by one to diarrhea. Five days after her husband died, a son, 3, and a daughter, 4, perished as well. 
"I have no one to help me," she said, beginning to weep. "There are some rich people in the village. When they feel like it, they give me scraps of bread."
Mrs. Gul looked toward Mr. Khan, who nodded amiably and said he himself was among the generous in this way. "But there is hunger all over, and if I give someone food for a month, then what follows after that?" he complained. "For how long do you help?"
The same matter troubles the aid agencies. These days, food is a lodestone, luring the hungry from their homes and into huge camps where paltry monthly rations -- usually just one hefty sack of wheat per family -- are nevertheless dependably supplied.
One such place has been set up in the city of Ser-i-pol. After the first gift of grain, the population of the camp doubled within a few days as destitute people eagerly forsook their mountain villages for life in a makeshift municipality of donated tents.
"The people won't leave and why should they?" asked Ghulam Nabi, director of the camp. He was standing amid long rows of white canvas tents. In the distance were snow-topped peaks. "Out there, there is no food or water or seed for planting."
In the past year, Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan's largest city, rapidly became home to 27 separate camps, with its own urban poor lining up for food alongside famished migrants. The merely vulnerable feel as entitled to a handout as the fully stricken.
Perhaps the biggest challenge ahead will be getting people to go home, where their last memories are of unendurable hardship, the burying of their dead, the dying of their animals, the eating of the seed they direly needed for the next season's planting.
Afghanistan is primarily a country of those who live from the land. When rain falls once again, they will require the replenishment of seed as well as fertilizer and tools and draft animals. 
"The key word is return," said Mireille Borne of the aid group Acted. "If you just give away food, you undermine the economy. You have to think about the long term."
The long term is what most disconsolate parents are thinking of when they sell their children. There is not much precedent in Afghanistan for this heart-wrenching sacrifice. Traditionally, girls are "sold" for marriage, with the bride's family collecting a price. But what is occurring now is closer to the practice of bonded labor. Arrangements differ but most often the child is exchanged for a continuing supply of cash or wheat.
"The family was very hungry and I needed help in my restaurant," said Muhammad Aslam, explaining why he bought two young brothers nearly two years ago. As he sipped tea, Bashir, 13, and Qadir, 11, were cleaning the cooking area in the narrow establishment in Sholgarah. "It is cheaper to buy boys than hire boys. Actually, I could have had them free." 
Mr. Aslam described the transaction: the boys' father had offered to give up his sons so long as they were kept well fed. "But I know about human rights," said the restaurant owner. "I knew I was obligated to pay him something."
The compensation settled upon was 400,000 Afghanis per month -- about $5 at the time of the deal. "After two years, I stop paying and the boys are mine forever," Mr. Aslam said happily, presenting the situation as something as benevolent as an adoption.
He asked the youngsters to sit at his side. He requested a smile. They complied.
Abdul Hamid, a porter, was also seated in the restaurant. "I've bought three children, all from different families," he volunteered. Noor Agha is 8, Amruddin 9, Malik 11. He sent someone to get the boys. He said he considered himself a doer of good deeds.
"These families were all hungry," Mr. Hamid said. "They cannot give their children what I can. The boys work for me, but I also send them to school. They are becoming my sons. If they get lonely, I have agreed to let them see their real parents every six months." 
Akhtar Muhammad, with his family starving in Kangori, bargained harder than most. For his 10-year-old, Sher, he now receives a stipend of 46 pounds of wheat per month; for the younger boy, 5-year-old Baz, he receives half that amount. The deal continues for six years.
"I have sold the two most intelligent of my 10 children," the father said insistently. 
Six weeks had passed since his sons were delivered to Sholgarah. He agreed to ride into the town, to search out his older boy, to inquire about the lad's uprooted life.
By chance, father and son happened upon each other in a crowded street. Immediately, they embraced. Sher was astride a donkey, toting several metal jugs. He had been sent to fetch a supply of water.
"They don't treat me well," the boy said sorrowfully when asked. Indeed, looking away from his father, his eyes moistened. He seemed close to sobbing.
"I work very hard and during the night they send me into the mountains to sleep with the sheep."
His father listened silently with no telling expression on his face. "I felt bad that I was sold," the boy continued, staring down now, swallowing his shame. "I cried. Sometimes I still cry. I cry at night. But I understand why the selling of me was necessary."
He is his family's antidote to hunger.
"I must go now," the 10-year-old said, riding off. "I must hurry or they will beat me."

HEADLINE: Constituents Go Star-Gazing at the State House 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 7 

 BODY:
In tough budget times, New Jersey lawmakers can be an awfully tough audience. 
 A handful of Hollywood celebrities descended on the State House today to make a pitch for $20 million to help build film production facilities in abandoned factories near the State Capitol. They were given star treatment: private briefings with lawmakers, state police escorts, shrieking fans, a news conference on the State House steps, and plenty of state senators lunging to be photographed beside the likes of William Baldwin, Paul Sorvino and Valerie Harper. 
 But in the end, the glitterati left town with little more than a warm welcome and a free lunch of baked ziti and tossed salad. 
In recent years, it hardly took star power to get a handout from New Jersey's government. The last Legislature, and the lame-duck acting governor, bestowed tax dollars on so many favored constituents and pet projects that they left behind huge budget deficits. With New Jersey now laying off hundreds of employees and cutting an assortment of popular programs, many lawmakers seemed reluctant today to support a measure that would grant millionaire movie stars a subsidy at taxpayers' expense. 
"I think this will be a tough sell to the public," said Richard J. Codey, co-president of the Senate. "Some people might think it's absurd." 
Whatever the ultimate fate of the proposal, Trenton's brush with fame certainly added a bit of buzz to a day when the most pressing issues were the swearing-in of the new state police superintendent and the sale of the Newark watershed.
State workers ducked out of their offices to snap pictures of celebrities strolling the halls. Glen Gilmore, mayor of the working-class suburb of Hamilton, came to meet with the movie stars and had a conversation with a publicist who bid farewell by actually saying, "I'll get back to you about that Travolta thing."
Mr. Codey took a break from a debate on the floor of the Senate and asked Mr. Baldwin if he had had a chance to appraise the senators' public speaking abilities.
"We were auditioning," he said, at least partly in jest. The appearance made the front pages of local newspapers, so hundreds of people crowded the Capitol steps for a peek at the stars, far more spectators than have appeared at any State House rally since the governor's inauguration two months ago. 
Jacquel Pfeiffer, a self-described artist, drove 45 minutes from her home in Fieldsboro in hopes of being discovered. "I do graphic arts in my spare time and I bartend at a family-oriented go-go bar," said Ms. Pfeiffer, who tried to stand out from the buttoned-down State House crowd by wearing black leather pants and a leopard-print halter. "But this movie thing is going to be my big break."
Mr. Baldwin, who promised that the state's $20 million in investments would bring a $100 million boost to New Jersey's economy, said he recognized that many who cheered his words were more interested in star-gazing than lawmaking. 
"It's a sad commentary that we have in this country a cult of celebrity," he said. "But we have to recognize that unfortunate reality and try to harness it responsibly, for projects that will help the economy of the entire community."
Senator Peter A. Inverso, the sponsor of the bill, said he believed that the public would eventually embrace the plan because it would help create jobs for all the bit players who are essential to moviemaking: gaffers, carpenters, lighting technicians, makeup artists, grips and hair stylists.
But there were few signs of any groundswell of support. Gov. James E. McGreevey, the one official with the most power to greenlight the project, did not meet with the actors, citing a scheduling conflict. 
When Mr. Sorvino took the floor of the Senate, legislators listened politely as he told them that he had three movies he would make in New Jersey if the aid package was approved. A few eyebrows were raised when Mr. Sorvino mentioned that his "good friend" Harvey Weinstein, president of Miramax Pictures, was also likely to invest millions in New Jersey filmmaking if the bill passed.
When he made reference to his daughter, the actress Mira Sorvino, one senator blurted out, "Maybe if he sent his daughter here it would have been more convincing."

GRAPHIC: Photo: Paul Sorvino, right, was among the actors who went to the New Jersey State House yesterday to ask for $20 million to help build moviemaking facilities in the state. Others who attended were, from left, William Baldwin, Leo Rossi and Al Sapienza. Hundreds of people showed up to see the stars. (Dith Pran/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Japan Economy Contracts for 3rd Consecutive Quarter 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, March 8 

 BODY:
Japan's economy contracted sharply in the fourth quarter of 2001, by 1.2 percent, the government reported today. It was the third consecutive quarter in which the economy shrank, the first such streak in nearly a decade. For all of 2001, the economy contracted 0.5 percent.
 Most forecasters now expect Japan's economy, the world's second largest after the United States, to go on shrinking this year as well, though not so rapidly, and for growth not to resume until 2003. By contrast, the United States economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent to 3 percent this year, according to the Federal Reserve. 
 But many analysts say that a mild pickup in the economy may make itself felt in Japan toward the end of 2002, because of the American recovery and because Japanese businesses have drawn their inventories down to low levels. 
"I expect the economy to post growth toward the middle of this year," Haruhiko Kuroda, the vice minister of finance, said before today's statistics were released.
The rapid growth analysts expect this year in the next two largest economies in East Asia -- 6 to 7 percent in China and 4 to 5 percent in South Korea -- should bolster Japan as well. But these countries are rivals as well as trading partners of Japan.
As a measure of shifting fortunes, a Chinese government study released this week predicted that within five years China would displace Japan as the world's largest personal computer market.
Corporate spending in Japan fell a steep 12 percent in the fourth quarter, according to today's report, as businesses laid off workers, put off purchases and investments and cut costs to weather the downturn. They have also worked off inventories, getting them down to levels not seen since 1990 and removing an obstacle to new growth.
"Japan's producers are in a fantastic position to benefit from the tail winds generated by America, Taiwan and Korea," Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities, told an investor conference in Tokyo on Wednesday. "Any incremental increase in demand from Asia, or particularly from the United States, is going to generate an export-led industrial recovery."
In a survey taken in February of executives at 264 Japanese companies, 42 percent said the recession would ease in the second half of 2002. "The economy is on the verge of bottoming out," Yotaro Kobayashi, the chairman of Fuji Xerox, said as he announced the survey results at a news conference here this week. "Though we must remain cautious, I believe the Japanese economy is heading in a favorable direction."
Just as cherry blossom season unfolds across Tokyo, a new exuberance, perhaps irrational, swept the markets here this week. The battered yen rallied to nearly 127 to the dollar in Tokyo today, a gain of more than 5 percent in the last month and its strongest level in several months. And the stock market's main index has shot up more than 20 percent since early February, closing Thursday with a gain of 2.6 percent to 11,648.34. It rose 85 points, or slightly less than 1 percent, in trading this morning.
Both rallies seem to be linked to the imminent end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31, a crucial date for the country's financial system. The yen's rise is attributable in part to companies repatriating assets and profits from overseas as they prepare to close their books for the year.
The stock market rally matters hugely for the nation's major banks, which have immense stock holdings and depend on their value at the end of the year for much of the capital they need to meet international standards. Government officials have publicly stated that the banks need the Nikkei 225-stock index to finish the year above 10,000 to keep them solvent.
To prop up the stock market, the government has introduced stiffer new penalties for short selling, a way of betting on falling prices that tends to accelerate declines. After the government penalized half a dozen, mainly foreign, brokerage houses here under the new rules, short sellers began unwinding their positions by repurchasing shares, starting a wave of buying. The government is also widely believed to be intervening in the market by having state-run companies and pension funds buy shares.
For all the market's present effervescence, though, in the real world of profits and losses, Japan's recession is taking a great toll. In a survey of 310 publicly held companies published on Thursday, profits this year are expected to be only one-quarter what they were in 2001, according to the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo. Even before the Bush administration announced new tariffs on steel imports, four of Japan's top five steel makers expected to report combined losses of $1.6 billion in the year ending March 31.
Prominent Americans visiting Japan are increasingly critical of what they say is the country's unwillingness to tackle its huge budget deficit, its banks' bad debt problems and excessive economic regulation.
"If Japanese governments continue to favor short-term comfort over long-term reform, Japan seems to me likely to remain on a road characterized by stagnation," Charlene Barshefsky, a Washington lawyer and former United States trade representative, said here on Monday. "Year by year, Japan's influence will erode, and the centrality of the U.S.-Japan relationship to Pacific affairs will diminish with it."
Last week, Japanese newspapers printed a letter that President Bush sent to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi before his visit to Tokyo last month. "I want to urge you to continue moving forward to tackle the problem of Japan's nonperforming loans," President Bush wrote. "I am also deeply concerned that these nonperforming loans and assets are not being moved quickly to the market."
On Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service signaled that it may reduce its rating of Japanese government debt by two notches by May. 
Japan's economic reverses have been complicated by the country's slip into a deflationary pattern of falling prices, falling wages and falling consumer spending, which economists say are interrelated phenomena that reinforce each other. One bright spot in the fourth-quarter statistical report today was an uptick in consumer spending from the period before.
Consumer prices have been falling in Japan for three years, and in a survey released Thursday by NLI Research of Tokyo, about 40 percent of 3,361 companies said they expected deflation in Japan to go on for another three years. Asked why, 54 percent of the group cited domestic competition, and 30 percent cited falling demand.
The government and the Bank of Japan have been trying to stem the deflation by flooding the economy with money on easy terms -- short-term interest rates are effectively zero. But the policy has shown little effect. In January, bank lending fell for 50th consecutive month and retail sales fell for the 10th month. Rapidly rising numbers of banknotes in circulation suggest that consumers are nervous even about keeping money in banks, and are squirrelling away cash under the futon.
Still, Prime Minister Koizumi said on Thursday that Japan is not in "a deflationary spiral," adding "we haven't gone as far as that."
And on Wednesday, Japan's powerful lower house approved the $630 billion federal budget, which is 1.7 percent smaller than last year's and the smallest since 1998.

HEADLINE: Final Rules for Federal Victims' Fund Increase Aid to Families of Sept. 11 Dead 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
Saying that the complaints from families of those killed or injured on Sept. 11 had not fallen on deaf ears, the official overseeing the federal Victims Compensation Fund announced final regulations today that he said would produce substantially larger awards than his initial rules would have allowed.
 Under the new rules, average awards -- before any mandated deductions for life insurance, pensions and assorted government benefits -- would increase to $1.85 million from $1.65 million, Kenneth R. Feinberg, special master of the Victims Compensation Fund, said at a news conference here today. 
 The new rules will temper the perceived harshness of the mandated deductions, he said, and they will also make it far easier for the injured to win awards, particularly the hundreds of rescue workers and firefighters now complaining of disabling lung ailments from working in the dust at ground zero.
"I've listened to the families and learned a great deal," said Mr. Feinberg, who said he had met with more than 1,000 families since he issued draft regulations in December. Mr. Feinberg strongly urged families today to sign up for the fund without further delay, and he specifically pledged that illegal immigrants would face no sanctions if they came forward. 
"They need not fear any type of prosecution," he said. 
To date, only 366 claims have been filed with the fund. To enter the fund, one must agree not to sue elsewhere. Mr. Feinberg, though, warned that Congress had left families with little alternative when it passed special legislation to protect airlines and others from lawsuits.
"The litigation option isn't real," he said with characteristic bluntness.
Today, most victims' groups, political leaders and lawyers reluctantly agreed with that assessment. But while lauding Mr. Feinberg for making significant improvements -- establishing a $250,000 minimum award, doubling noneconomic awards to dependents to $100,000 from $50,000, offering ballpark award estimates to families before they commit to the fund -- several continued to voice angry complaints about various provisions. And some were already exploring the possibility of challenging the fund's final regulations in federal court.
Carie Lemack, president of Families of Sept. 11, said that the fund was barely improved, especially for spouses with young children, whose substantial Social Security death benefits would still be deducted from awards.
Lee S. Kreindler, senior partner at Kreindler & Kreindler, a law firm that represents the families of more than 150 men and women who died in the attacks, said that the final rules penalize high-income families by disregarding any income over $225,000 from calculations of economic losses.
"They've made some improvements," he said. "But for the large cases, mostly in the financial industry, the young people who were earning a lot of money and leave behind families, it is a rather dismal prospect. Those cases are dreadfully undervalued."
Yet, he added, challenging the final regulations in court poses risks, too. "What if that prompted Congress to revisit the entire statute?" he asked, mindful of the public reaction in some quarters against the fund. "You wonder what you're going to end up with when it's all over."
Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, had found the draft regulations so offensive that he had threatened to sue Mr. Feinberg, arguing that the regulations as first envisioned failed to follow the intent of Congress. But today, Mr. Spitzer said that Mr. Feinberg's revisions and clarifications had persuaded him that he no longer had any solid basis for a court challenge. He, too, urged families to file claims.
"He has said repeatedly that the proof will be in the magnitude of awards," Mr. Spitzer said. "We have to put him to the test."
Mr. Feinberg, who was appointed special master of the fund by Attorney General John Ashcroft, refused to budge on perhaps the most controversial element of his draft rules -- his decision to pay all families a flat rate of $250,000 for the pain and suffering of relatives killed in the attacks.
Hundreds of victims, all the major victim groups and virtually every major political leader in the Northeast had urged Mr. Feinberg and the Bush administration to increase that $250,000 payment. They cited scores of jury awards in other airline crash cases in which such payments were in the millions. But Mr. Feinberg today continued to insist that the $250,000 pain and suffering payment was fair and appropriate.
"Reasonable people can differ," he said.
Seeking to allay the concerns of New York City leaders, Mr. Feinberg was far more flexible in modifying the final regulations for claims by the injured.
The draft regulations said that rescue workers were eligible for awards only if they suffered a disabling injury in the first 12 hours after the attacks, sought treatment within 96 hours and had contemporaneous medical records to document the injury. In the final regulations, those deadlines are eliminated, as is the requirement for contemporaneous medical records.
"It is a favorable change in the winds," said James P. McGarry, a lawyer in New York whose firm represents more than 1,000 firefighters who have complained of respiratory problems. Roughly half of them are temporarily or permanently disabled, he said, and "the statistics are getting grimmer and grimmer."
The final regulations open the door to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in fund awards to these men, he said.
Mr. Feinberg said such an assumption was premature at best. Each case must be scrutinized, he said. At the same time, however, Mr. Feinberg strongly rebutted assertions from some quarters that the families' complaints about the fund were driven by rank greed.
"That criticism is definitely unwarranted," Mr. Feinberg said. "It's unfair." In his experience, he said, these are grief-stricken families -- many of them deeply afraid for their financial futures -- who are trying to put their lives back together.
"It has nothing to do with greed."

HEADLINE: FILM IN REVIEW; 
'Miss Wonton'

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
Directed by Meng Ong
Not rated, 88 minutes
 "Miss Wonton," Meng Ong's debut feature, tells the story of Ah Na (Amy Ting), a young woman who emigrates from rural China to New York City, where she finds a job working at a small restaurant near Grand Central Terminal. She shares cramped sleeping quarters upstairs with her co-workers and gravitates to the Golden Palace, a section of the train station where immigrant women gather in the hopes of picking up American men. 
 The women have culinary classifications associated with their countries of origin -- thus Wonton -- and the men are sorted by economic status, with meatloaf at the bottom and escargot at the top. Ah Na snags an escargot, a middle-aged insurance executive (James Burns) in a suit and tie and, after spending a night at his house in the suburbs, convinces herself that the American dream is within her reach.
Considered objectively, the events in "Miss Wonton," which opens today at Cinema Village (22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village), have a sad, sleazy quality. But Mr. Ong chooses to present Ah Na's life as a slight, weightless fairy tale, whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism. A number of big, complex issues pile up around her -- AIDS, the sexual and economic exploitation of immigrants, the brutality of Chinese peasant traditions -- but none of them take on much dramatic weight.
The director has fallen into the common first-timer's trap of biting off more than he can chew, stitching together an unwieldy, disorganized story out of subplots and flashbacks, without paying enough attention to the basic requirements of character and narrative. 
Ah Na herself must walk a tightrope between sophistication and naivete, and as a result her personality is blurred and her motives are hard to understand. Mr. Ong seems to think that the only way to make her sympathetic is to make her completely innocent, pitching the film into a state of moral confusion.
Ah Na, along with her best friend, Ling (Chyna Ng), was the victim of a vicious slander back home involving her supposed promiscuity, but the way the matter is resolved leaves one a little queasy. And the movie's conclusion, brazenly throwing realism to the wind, strikes a note of buoyant determination that seems, after the muddle that has preceded it, not so much refreshing as absurd.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Interest Rates Are Steady 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The European Central Bank and the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged amid signs of an economic rebound. 
The European Central Bank, which sets rates for the dozen countries using the euro, left its benchmark rate at 3.25 percent. The Bank of England kept its main lending rate at 4 percent. The central banks of Europe and Britain along with the United States Federal Reserve have signaled that they are done lowering borrowing costs as global economies show signs of recovery. Central bankers now want to gauge the resilience of the recovery before nudging rates higher, analysts said. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: France:Retailer's Profit Falls 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The French retailer Pinault Printemps-Redoute reported a decline of nearly 2 percent in 2001 earnings as profitability was hurt by the economic slowdown in the United States and higher financial charges from acquisitions. 
The retail group, whose operations include the electrical supplies retailer Rexel and the Gucci fashion house, said its outlook for 2002 was cautious. The chairman, Serge Weinberg, said the company's steps to rein in costs in the face of economic slowdown meant it had begun the year with a more favorable cost structure. In 2001, the company's profit fell 1.9 percent, to 752.7 million euros. Sales were up 12 percent, to 27.8 billion euros.

Intel Sees Quarter Revenue Running Largely on Track

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 7 

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation, the world's largest chip maker, narrowed its first-quarter forecast near the top end of its range today, as sales of computer chips followed normal patterns for this time of year.
 Midway through its quarter, Intel said it was on track to report revenue of $6.6 billion to $6.9 billion, compared with the $6.4 billion to $7 billion it projected on Jan. 15. In the period last year, revenue was $6.7 billion. 
 The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it expected that gross profit margins would exceed 50 percent, above the midpoint of its previous forecast. Analysts said Intel appeared to have sold more of its higher-priced chips, for notebooks and data-serving computers.
"We have seen some stronger demand in the server space than we anticipated going into the quarter," Andy D. Bryant, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts.
Computer chip sales usually drop as much as 10 percent from the fourth quarter to the first, as holiday purchases of computers and consumer electronics slow. Intel, which reported sales of $7 billion in the fourth quarter, said that its computer chip business was following the usual seasonal decline and that sales of its communications chips like flash memory remained weak.
"Intel's business is performing pretty much as we expected at the beginning of the quarter," Mr. Bryant said, adding, "We've seen no evidence yet of an economic recovery in our business."
After suffering through its worst year on record in 2001, the semiconductor industry appears to have reached the bottom of its decline. Chip makers have reported that customers in the computer industry -- though not in the communications equipment industry -- have largely cleared their excess inventory.
But few companies or analysts predict a sharp rebound without a lift from the general economy.
"We are setting the stage for a recovery," said Thomas A. Thornhill III, an analyst with UBS Warburg. "We still need macroeconomic growth to help really drive order growth for semiconductors."
Earlier in the day, National Semiconductor, which makes analog chips for devices like cellphones and computer displays, reported a loss but offered a rare positive forecast. For its fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 24, the company reported a loss of $37.8 million, or 21 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $39.2 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
But the loss was narrower than the 27 cents analysts had expected, and officials of National Semiconductor, also in Santa Clara, said they saw signs of recovery for the first time in a year and a half. New orders rose 16 percent over the period a year earlier, and the company's book-to-bill ratio -- a measure of new orders compared with orders shipped -- was above 1.0, a sign of a growing market.
"This is the first such growth message in six quarters," Brian L. Halla, the chairman and chief executive of National Semiconductor, told analysts.
Mr. Halla said he would let the analysts decide whether an improving marketplace or strong management at his company had caused the increase in orders. "I believe it's a little of each," he said.
In regular trading before the announcement, Intel's stock rose 2 cents today, to $32.98. After hours it declined 28 cents, to $32.70. Shares in National Semiconductor, which reported its results at midday, rose $1.35, or 4 percent, to $32.96.

HEADLINE: Testing His Metal 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Just a few days ago, some supporters of George W. Bush hoped that he would show his mettle by standing up to steel industry demands for tariff protection. Instead he capitulated, with a cravenness that surprised even his critics.
 It's quite a contrast with Bill Clinton, who -- like Mr. Bush -- declared his belief in the benefits of free trade, but -- unlike Mr. Bush -- was willing to spend a lot of political capital in support of that belief. Many Democrats are protectionists, so Mr. Clinton reached out for Republican support to pass both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the treaty creating the World Trade Organization. He defied intense bipartisan opposition to rescue Mexico from its 1995 financial crisis, which might have destroyed Nafta, and resisted pressure to limit imports, including steel imports, during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. 
 It's possible that Mr. Clinton's determination to do what he believed was right on international trade cost the Democrats the White House -- not just because West Virginia's electoral votes provided Mr. Bush with his winning margin, but because Mr. Clinton's free-trade policies fueled Ralph Nader's spoiler campaign. 
Now we know for sure what some of us already suspected: that the Bush administration is all hat and no cattle when it comes to free trade, and probably free markets in general. 
Never mind Mr. Bush's claim that his decision to impose high tariffs on imported steel was simply a matter of enforcing the law. Nothing in U.S. law obliged him to impose tariffs -- and it's pretty clear that the tariffs violate our international trade treaties. 
We can also dismiss the claim that this was "temporary relief so that the industry could restructure itself." Traditional steel producers are in long-term decline, the result less of imports than of competition from so-called mini-mills, exacerbated by the fact that an increasingly service-oriented economy uses far less steel per dollar of G.D.P. than it used to. A temporary import tariff won't turn this trend around.
True, the steel industry does have a special problem: "legacy costs," the benefits steel companies promised to retired workers in happier days. These costs mean that the failure of major companies would cause disproportionate hardship; they also make it hard for the industry to reorganize itself, because no investor wants to buy a company burdened with huge liabilities.
But economists long ago concluded that import restrictions are the wrong way to deal with domestic problems. Such problems should, instead, be dealt with at the source -- in this case, by having the government take over at least some of those liabilities. Trying to mitigate the problem with tariffs will be far less effective, and will impose a lot of collateral damage. As one harsh critic of the administration's action declared, tariffs "are nothing more than taxes that hurt low- and moderate-income people."
Oh, sorry -- that wasn't an administration critic. That's what Robert Zoellick, Mr. Bush's trade representative, said a few weeks before his master decided that protectionism in the pursuit of political advantage is no vice.
If Mr. Bush really felt he had to do something for the steel industry, why not address the legacy costs? His excuse -- that such action is up to Congress, not the White House -- was, like the claim that he was just upholding the law, a weak (and characteristic) effort to shift the blame. (Am I the only one who thinks of this as the 'Johnny did it!' administration?) The real reason, presumably, was that direct help to the industry would be an explicit budget item, while the costs of protectionism -- though far larger -- are mostly hidden. 
In addition to being bad economics, the steel tariffs are terrible diplomacy. Our staunchest allies are outraged: Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, pronounced the move "unwarranted, unacceptable and wrong." Even before the steel verdict, the United States was developing a reputation for hypocrisy -- ready and willing to criticize others for failing to live up to their responsibilities, but unwilling to live up to its own. Now that our free-trade rhetoric has proved empty, who will listen to our preaching?
Let's be clear: Many Democrats were on the wrong side of the steel issue. But it was up to Mr. Bush to show leadership, to demonstrate that he really cares about the principles he espouses. I guess not.
