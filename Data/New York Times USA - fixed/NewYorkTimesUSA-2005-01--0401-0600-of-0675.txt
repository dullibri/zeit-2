HEADLINE: Price Index Rose 3.3% In '04, Highest In 4 Years

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index, the best-known measure of inflation in America, rose 3.3 percent last year, the largest increase since 2000, the government reported yesterday. 
 The higher inflation rate was a result of a surge in oil prices early last year. Oil prices have since leveled off, allowing the inflation rate to return to more modest levels.
 The moderating trend was already evident in December, when the index fell by 0.1 of a percent, the first month-to-month decline since July. That was mostly because of a sharp drop in gasoline prices; gas prices fell again in early January. 
 ''We don't see any sign of an immediate pickup in inflation,'' said Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment firm. ''That said, looking out toward the end of the year, we think the trends are in the direction of a very modest pickup.''
 In the New York region, rising fuel costs helped drive the largest year-over-year increase in the index since 1990. [Page B1.]
 The trends that Mr. Tilton and other forecasters point to are higher prices for imports as the dollar falls and for materials used in manufacturing. 
 Ian C. Shepherdson, chief economist for High Frequency Economics, said, ''I think there will be a recognition, that if the dollar falls far enough and commodity prices rise fast enough, you can push up goods prices.''
 Citing such pressures, many Wall Street economists predicted yesterday that the Federal Reserve's policy makers would continue to raise interest rates by a quarter of a point at their meetings this year until the crucial federal funds rate gets at least above 3 percent and perhaps above 3.5 percent. 
 The federal funds rate, now at 2.25 percent, is the rate that banks and other financial institutions charge each other for loans. As it rises, so do mortgage and auto loan rates, as well as the cost of other consumer and business credit. The Fed's goal is to curtail spending and, in doing so, damp price increases. 
 Whatever the future holds, inflation today remains decidedly modest. The so-called core inflation rate, covering all prices except those for energy and food, rose 2.2 percent last year, roughly the rate that has prevailed each year since 1997 with the exception of 2003, when the core rate was 1.1 percent. The December increase conformed to this pattern; the core rose only 0.1 percent.
 Rising prices for new and used cars accounted for more than half of the rise in last year's core C.P.I. rate, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Actually, car prices rose only modestly, but they fell in 2003 and the swing from negative to positive magnified that category's contribution to inflation.
 The swing drew a cautionary comment from Mr. Shepherdson. ''The automakers are sneaking through sticker price increases and consumers are not feeling them because they are getting financing incentives,'' he said. ''I guess what the manufacturers are hoping to do is reduce the incentives and reap the benefits of higher sticker prices.''
 The rising cost of housing and rates for hotel rooms also contributed significantly to last year's inflation rate. The various costs of maintaining a home rose most sharply, but hotel rates also jumped as travel picked up strongly.
 Beyond the increases for autos and housing, and a noticeable rise in the prices of home furnishings and medical care, there was little upward movement in the prices of goods and services. Apparel prices fell in December, by 0.4 percent.
 ''The core inflation rate, in the broad historical scheme of things, is still very low, just over 2 percent,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, ''and it is not likely to go much higher as long as the job market remains soft and there is still more production capacity in manufacturing than there is demand for what is produced.''
 The 3.3 percent jump in the overall inflation rate last year was the largest since 1991, except for the 3.4 percent rise in 2000. The rise in the average hourly wage last year did not keep pace, so workers lost ground. Real hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.4 percent, the first decline since the early 1990's.
 Separately, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts, when ground is broken for the construction of new homes and apartments, rose in December to a strong annual rate just above 2 million from 1.8 million, nearly as strong, in November. For all of last year, starts totaled 1.95 million.

HEADLINE: Is less government really better for business? Not if history provides a reliable guide.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick. 
Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His most recent book is ''Why Economies Grow'' (Basic Books/Century Foundation). E-mail:challenge@mesharpe.com

 BODY:
WHAT is the purpose of government in the American economy? To many people these days, it is axiomatic that less government is invariably better for the economy and the nation. In this way, tax cut after tax cut is justified despite a growing federal budget deficit. Such thinking also lies behind the efforts to privatize Social Security. 
 But it is hard to square this view that government is always an economic menace with the long history of capitalist development. Going back in time, every successful capitalist economy in the world has had an active partnership between government and business. Even when the United States government was small in the nineteenth century, it built the canals, subsidized the railroads, made private ownership of land accessible, and developed a widely envied public education system. 
 Consider how the role of government changed in America as the economy and society changed. The presidency of Thomas Jefferson is a good example. Jefferson is criticized today because he feared the encroachment of manufacturing on what he considered an American agricultural utopia. Jefferson fought against the establishment of American tariffs and promoted free trade, so farmers could easily sell their produce to Europe. He favored a small government and discouraged the public financing of internal improvements like roads. 
 It was Alexander Hamilton, the favorite founding father of business, who wanted to protect domestic manufacturing from foreign competition by imposing tariffs. Hamilton also wanted a powerful central federal government, which could sell its own bonds and build the roads the nation badly needed. 
 As the economy evolved, however, even Jefferson began to change his tune, accepting modest tariffs. More to the point, his followers became government activists. In the nation's early years, they began to support manufacturers and tariffs. In particular, the Jeffersonians in New York used government money to build the great public project of the day, the Erie Canal. Jeffersonians in other states followed suit. 
 The United States economy is still changing radically. Consider the last 30 years. The two-worker family is now the norm, largely because a single wage can no longer support a family. The quality of public education is highly unequal, depending more than ever on how upscale one's neighborhood is. Health care costs are rising much faster than typical family incomes. Computers and the Internet have become necessities not luxuries.
 More use of the markets may help solve some of these problems. But judicious and imaginative use of government will also be necessary. Government, however, is being shut out as an alternative. 
 Consider an index of economic freedom published annually by the Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal, which ranks more than 150 nations largely on the level of government interference in the economy. The lower the taxes, the lower the barriers to free trade and the smaller the government share of gross domestic product, for example, the higher the nation's ranking on the index. Limited social programs, of course, also improve the freedom quotient. The editors of the report contend that such economic freedom is the ''universal'' key to prosperity. 
 But compare those top 10 countries to the 10 most competitive countries on a list compiled by an international business group, the World Economic Forum. The forum's growth competitive index is based heavily on an opinion survey of business executives, as well as measures of technological sophistication and other factors. 
 Only 3 of the 10 most competitive nations are among the Heritage Foundation's index of the world's 10 freest nations. They are Singapore, Denmark, and Iceland. In fact, some countries like Finland, Sweden and Norway, all with high taxes and generous welfare systems, are considered by business executives among the 10 most competitive nations. Why? Because they use their government spending to improve education, for example. 
 Indeed, Norway, which has the second highest gross domestic product per capita in the world, ranks 29 on the index of economically free nations. The Chinese economic miracle has occurred even though China ranks 112 on the index of economically free nations. 
 Such attitudes that less government is invariably better have restricted this nation's vision, compared with the bold efforts of the past. Education is a good example. It has become as difficult to live a middle-class life today without a college degree as it was to lead a decent life without a high school education 100 years ago. One hundred years before that, the same was true for a primary school education. 
 In the early 1900's, a dynamic nation built the free high schools it needed and hired the teachers. In the preceding century, it built a free primary school system that by 1850 was more widely attended than the system of any other nation.
 Government did all this. But if we ask the nation to consider financing a four-year college education for everyone today, neither Republicans nor Democrats will entertain the idea. They even find it quaint and naive. We are mostly told that we cannot afford this and that individuals should fend for themselves. 
 Yet the president may soon be willing to borrow $2 trillion to privatize Social Security. Advocates say that the Social Security system will cost less in five or six decades as a result of privatization. But if that $2 trillion were channeled into college education, imagine the gains in new ideas, in a superior labor force, and in productivity in general. 
 Instead of bold new roles for government, the right increasingly reverts to a mantra about less government, while the left, hamstrung, offers few new imaginative plans for a changing society. 
 If our politicians realize that the purpose of government is to adapt to, and even promote, change, they may at last deal successfully with the nation's problems. At the moment, that looks unlikely.

HEADLINE: Uneven Slopes Can Lead Straight to the Top

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: LAKE PLACID, N.Y., Jan. 17 

 BODY:
A year ago, Travis Mayer, the silver medalist in moguls at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, had all but quit skiing to study economics at Cornell. His weekends were no longer spent in the dazzling ski resorts of the World Cup circuit, but in the humdrum of a quiet Ivy League library.
 At roughly the same time, Jeremy Bloom was spending his weekends in clamorous stadiums around the country, living the life of a major college football player at the University of Colorado.
 Today, Mayer is the world's top-ranked men's freestyle mogul skier, and Bloom, a former world champion, is not far behind. It may be an unorthodox approach to conquering a sport, but Mayer and Bloom are taking the uneven path, which may not be so unusual in a sport in which the trail to success is nearly always bumpy. 
 ''It's not normal,'' Mayer said. ''But then this is freestyle.''
 Or, as Bloom said: ''Chasing dreams can be complicated. But worth it.''
 And so, while Bloom wants to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics next year in Turin, Italy, and has stopped playing football at Colorado, he plans to enter the N.F.L. draft after the 2006 Games.
 ''I haven't given up football,'' said Bloom, who returned punts and kickoffs and played wide receiver at Colorado. ''I want to play for the Jets.''
 Mayer and Bloom may be the two biggest names among male American moguls skiers, but they are part of a gaggle of 2006 Olympic medal contenders on the United States team. Toby Dawson was the world's top-ranked mogul skier until he broke his foot last week. Dawson, who was second in the World Cup standing last year, may be back in a month. There is also Travis Cabral, the World Cup champion in 2003, and Luke Westerlund, who is known as Skywalker, who had a top-three World Cup finish earlier this month.
 Mayer, a 22-year-old who was reared outside Buffalo, always seems to be the one who receives the least attention in the group. On Saturday, he won the World Cup moguls event at Whiteface Mountain outside Lake Placid, N.Y., with two dynamic runs down a course hardened by frigid temperatures. Several competitors went skittering off the course, including Bloom, who lost his balance approaching his second jump in Saturday's finals.
 It was a result a bit reminiscent of Mayer's silver-medal performance at the 2002 Olympics. All the attention leading up to those Winter Games had been on Bloom, who was ranked No. 1 in the world at the time, and Jonny Moseley, the defending gold medalist. Bloom ended up ninth and Moseley was fourth.
 ''I am a bit under the radar, but I like it that way -- there are fewer distractions,'' Mayer said Saturday.
 But in 2003, after winning his Olympic silver medal, Mayer discovered that the expectations for him had risen significantly, and it affected his skiing.
 ''It was starting to wear on me, and I was losing perspective,'' he said. ''So I decided to go back to school.''
 He went back to a life of near anonymity. ''The seniors at Cornell had heard the story,'' Mayer, who is a junior, said. ''It was kind of old hat. The underclassmen didn't know or care.''
 Along the way in his year's sabbatical, Mayer found he missed competing.
 ''I have come back with a lot more passion for skiing and a lot less fear,'' he said. ''When I get in the start, I tell myself I could be sitting at a desk studying, waiting to graduate and move on to my cubicle somewhere. That makes me appreciate the skiing -- even on the toughest days.''
 Bloom, 22, left college under different circumstances.
 ''I got a solid kick out the door,'' he said.
 Bloom had challenged a National Collegiate Athletic Association ruling that said he could not receive endorsement money from his skiing career and remain eligible to play football at Colorado. For two years, he had not taken the money, and since he had to pay for much of his own travel and training to compete in the moguls, he missed many competitions and opportunities to practice.
 ''I basically took two years off,'' Bloom said. ''There were months when you could count the amount of time I spent on skis by the hour not the day.''
 But last year, Bloom decided to accept the skiing sponsorships even if it meant giving up his football eligibility. He still hoped to do both, and fought the N.C.A.A. regulations, but in the end he was declared ineligible.
 ''I don't regret it and I won't even if I don't win a gold medal next year,'' he said. ''And I hope the N.F.L. is in my future. I want to be known as someone who was successful in both. Eventually, the N.C.A.A. will change its rule.''
 Bloom has not exactly dropped out of sight. He has a budding modeling career, and was on the cover of Abercrombie & Fitch's Christmas catalog. A three-sport athlete in high school (football, skiing and track), Bloom also sees himself as a role model against the national trend of young athletes' specializing in one sport at an early age.
 ''I went against that pressure for years,'' said Bloom, who was named to the United States Ski Team as a 15-year-old and kept playing two other high school sports. ''I hope some 10-year-old who wants to play basketball and do BMX biking thinks of me when a coach tells him he has to choose one or the other. I hope that kid says: 'No way, man, I'm doing what I believe is right. I'm doing both.'''
 For now, however, Bloom is paying for his diversity with inconsistent results in the moguls.
 ''When I'm on, I can still win,'' said Bloom, who came into last weekend's moguls event ranked fifth in the world. ''But since I'm devoting all my time to skiing again, I'm testing out new things. It's sort of like Tiger Woods's approach, sometimes you have to remake some things. And, I have to make up for two years of not training.
 ''Back then, I might have been busy getting ready for the Big 12 championship instead. So that's O.K. I will always have those memories. Now I just have to make some new ones.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall Amid Earnings That Analysts Call Mediocre

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as disappointing results from companies like Motorola and Lucent Technologies overshadowed economic data that showed declines in consumer prices.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 11.35 points, or 1 percent, to 1,184.63. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.82 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,539.97. The Nasdaq composite index fell 32.45, or 1.5 percent, to 2,073.59. 
 Benchmark indexes extended their declines in the final hour of trading, sending the S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq to their second-steepest losses in 2005. Yesterday's slide followed the market's first back-to-back gains of the year.
 The S.&P. 500 has lost 0.5 percent since the reporting season began on Jan. 10. For the year, it is down 2.3 percent amid rising oil prices and concern that the Federal Reserve will step up its pace of interest rate increases.
 ''It's becoming evident that so far earnings at best are just O.K., not great,'' said Peter Boockvar, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Company in New York.
 Motorola, the mobile phone maker, fell $1.23, or 7 percent, to $16.20. The company said it expected first-quarter earnings of 17 cents to 20 cents a share. The average analyst estimate is 20 cents, according to Thomson.
 Lucent, the nation's largest maker of telephone equipment, lost 28 cents, falling to $3.42, after its fiscal first-quarter sales trailed analysts' estimates. Sales were $2.34 billion, less than the $2.41 billion expected by analysts in a Thomson survey.
 A gauge of computer and communication equipment makers that includes Motorola and Lucent slid 2.6 percent, the worst performance among the S.&P.'s 24 industry groups.
 Rambus, a designer of high-speed memory chips used by Samsung Electronics and Sony, plunged $3.46, or 16 percent, to $17.85 on the Nasdaq exchange. Net income last quarter fell to 6 cents a share, Rambus said late yesterday. Analysts expected 8 cents, on average, according to a Thomson survey.
 Even some companies whose results beat expectations failed to get a lift. I.B.M., the world's largest provider of computer services, declined $1.80, or 2 percent, to $93.10, even after saying that fourth-quarter profit had surpassed the average analyst estimate in a Thomson survey.
 Verizon Communications, the largest United States telephone company, lost $1.03, falling to $36.65 in its 14th decline in 15 days. Revenue growth for Verizon's local phone business is lagging behind peers like SBC Communications, a Morgan Stanley analyst, Simon Flannery, wrote in a note to clients. 
 Maytag slumped $1.94, or 10 percent, to $16.73, the steepest drop in the S.&P. 500, after Best Buy said it would stop selling Maytag washers, dryers and ranges.
 Fannie Mae, the largest source of financing for United States home mortgages, slid $2.27, to $67.43, after it cut its quarterly dividend in half to build capital as required by a federal regulator.
 The 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 10020/32, after a government report showed that consumer prices unexpectedly declined in December, a sign that inflation may be contained. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.17 percent, from 4.18 percent on Tuesday.
 Shorter-maturity notes, which are more sensitive to expectations about monetary policy, showed little change; investors expect the Federal Reserve to continue to raise its benchmark interest rate this year to make sure inflation remains in check. Inflation erodes the value of a bond's interest payments.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.851
High Rate: 1.910
Coupon Yield: 1.939
Low Rate: 1.850
Median Rate: 1.900
Total applied for: $30,322,078
Accepted: $10,001,578
Noncompetitive: $71,192

The four-week bills mature Feb. 17, 2005.

HEADLINE: In Pataki's Budget, Transit Advocates See Trouble for M.T.A.

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is already planning to raise fares every two years starting in 2006, could be forced to do so earlier and in progressively higher increments as it struggles to pay for a gap in its new five-year capital plan, transit advocates said yesterday. 
 A day after Gov. George E. Pataki proposed a $105.5 billion budget for the next fiscal year, transit officials and others were digesting the transportation portion. Though Mr. Pataki proposed increasing taxes and fees to pay for what he called $19.2 billion in transit spending over five years, transit advocates asserted yesterday that the source of most of that money was unexplained or based on unrealistic assumptions. Of the total amount, $15.2 billion is intended for maintenance and upkeep and $2 billion for expansion. The figure also includes $2 billion in city funds for the westward extension of the No. 7 line. 
 The authority in September had requested $27.7 billion, including $17.2 billion for essential maintenance. Critics said yesterday that Mr. Pataki had not demonstrated where most of his proposed $19.2 billion would come from.
 ''It's the first time there's been such great uncertainty in 20 years,'' said Richard Ravitch, who was chairman of the authority from 1979 to 1983.
 Mr. Ravitch said that some of his worst fears were being realized. ''I have said since 1980 that the M.T.A. needs a recurring, inflation-sensitive source of revenue to fund a continuation of its capital improvement plan,'' he said. ''This proposal does not appear to meet that test.'' 
 The governor's aides disputed that assertion, saying the governor planned to aggressively lobby Washington for greater transit aid and insisting that the authority had to exert greater discipline and find creative ways to pay for its needs. 
 ''We're confident that working together with the M.T.A., we'll be able to achieve this plan,'' said Adam L. Barsky, a deputy secretary.
 Ronald Rock, the deputy director of the state's Division of the Budget, said: ''It's going to be a challenge for the M.T.A. They're going to have to do some hard actions, but they agree they'll be able to accomplish them.''
 Officials briefed on the plans yesterday said the authority might be asked to raise money by issuing pension-obligation bonds and by tapping into a $200 million stabilization account created late last year. 
 In addition, the officials said, Mr. Pataki supports an initiative proposed by the authority in 2002 to consolidate several subsidiaries. The Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad would be combined into an entity called M.T.A. Railroads, but that plan has stalled in the Legislature. 
 Officials at the authority declined to comment on the governor's budget. ''We're still reviewing it,'' said a spokesman, Tom Kelly. 
 Critics of Mr. Pataki said the measures would be minuscule compared with the shortfall in the authority's capital budget.
 ''I don't think anyone's quite absorbed the level of calamity that's likely to befall subway, bus and commuter rail riders,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly committee that oversees the authority. Mr. Brodsky added, ''Dramatic fare increases and worse service are inevitable.'' Mr. Ravitch and other transit advocates said they feared a similar outcome. 
 The authority raised tolls and fares last month, and it plans to do so again in 2006. But as a greater proportion of the budget goes to pay off old debt, the authority's capacity to borrow money against capital projects has declined.
 Even normally circumspect business leaders expressed reservations about the plan, saying that the figures did not add up to the sum that the governor had promised.
 Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, which represents construction, engineering, real estate and architectural firms in New York City, went further. ''The budget proposal is enormously less than what the transportation needs of New York State require,'' he said.

HEADLINE: New York Jumps Gun On Stadium

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SEBASTIAN COE possesses two Olympic gold medals in the 1,500 meters and two silvers in the 800 meters. Presumably he knows something about not making false starts.
 Lord Coe, as he is titled as a member of the House of Lords in Britain, is a Conservative in every sense of the word. As the chairman of the London bid for the 2012 Summer Games, he is firmly endorsing not bolting into action too soon. 
 London does not have anything remotely resembling an Olympic stadium, but that's all right. The city endured the Great Fire and the Blitz. It knows the value of patience. 
 ''You get the green light in July, you can put the bulldozers in place the next day,'' Coe said in a telephone interview last month.
 In the home of Marryin' Donald Trump and other such impetuous folk, you can hear the frantic gnawing and pounding of big-time lobbying to get steam shovels in the ground on the West Side of Manhattan, sometime before July 6. That is when the International Olympic Committee, meeting in Singapore, will choose the host of the 2012 Games.
 The I.O.C. does not stipulate that a bidding city must have a stadium in place seven years before the Games commence. Nor does the I.O.C., in its new posture of professionalism and environmentalism and economic compassion, demand that potential hosts refrain from building until the host is chosen.
 ''I don't think there is one rule of thumb,'' said Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff, the man behind NYC2012 who knows those rules by heart. 
 Paris is the only one of the five bidding cities to have a stadium in place -- the handsome, modern Stade de France, built for the 1998 World Cup, and underutilized ever since. 
 Although Paris appears to be the favorite for 2012, this is not necessarily because the Olympic stadium exists. Moscow and Madrid plan to upgrade existing stadiums not far from downtown, but not until well after being assured of being the host.
 ''It isn't essential,'' Coe said of having a stadium in place.
 In fact, not one Olympic host has ever built a stadium while awaiting the result of the vote. Moscow's old Luzhniki Stadium and Los Angeles's old Coliseum served Coe just fine for his four medals in 1980 and 1984. 
 New York, however, is twitching for a head start because the Summer Games are being used as a linchpin, an emotional greenie, to kick off some humongous economic movement on the West Side of Manhattan.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Doctoroff are attempting to build a three-headed monster -- part Olympic and Jets stadium, part sports arena with a retractable roof and air-conditioning, and part adjunct to the existing Javits Convention Center.
 Never mind that the convention business is in a slump, and never mind that New York is a distant outsider for the 2012 Summer Games. 
 The appeal of the stadium and the rationale for the billion-dollar Brasilia on the Hudson come directly from the Olympics. 
 ''There is almost a religious belief in the Olympics,'' said New York City Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn, who represents the West Side neighborhood that would be affected by any growth.
 ''Their belief in the Olympics has blinded them.'' 
 Everybody who has ever slumped in front of the tube during the midsummer doldrums and sniffled at a medal ceremony has emotional investment in the Olympics, usually beyond reason. 
 Host cities are often blinded, at least until the bill is served, which is now happening in Athens, billions of dollars over budget, with last summer's Olympic buildings rusting away in front of the public's eyes. 
 Doctoroff and the other 2012 planners seem smarter than that. They claim that all of the 2012 Olympic facilities will be used afterward, with no attached debts. 
 Why are the 2012 boosters so intense about getting the Jets' $1.4 billion playground going before this summer's I.O.C. vote? One theory is that they fear taxpayer lawsuits and opposition from the cuddly Dolans of Cablevision could stall building after New York was chosen, which would be terribly inconvenient.
 For some reason, in a city of millions of slickers, there is not enough civic skepticism about the mayor's moving three playing cards very quickly around a cardboard box.
 Fortunately, some resistance is coming from the New York City Council, which yesterday voted, 46 to 1, to separate economic growth on the far West Side of Manhattan from any stadium building. The 2012 boosters immediately proclaimed this vote as a major victory, but stadium skeptics labeled it as a tactic for delay and clarification.
 ''By cutting off that revenue stream, we'll have to see where they're coming from,'' Quinn added. 
 Quinn does not consider herself anti-Olympics but she says there are better places for an Olympic stadium that blocks the view of the Hudson River. The mayor's office must still sell the stadium concept to all three members of the state's Public Authorities Control Board in February. 
 ''Not to sound too sportsy, but it's like a Hail Mary pass,'' Quinn said of the intense pressure to start the giant earthmovers. 
 Meanwhile, all five bid cities are poised at the starting line, like Sebastian Coe about to burst into gear. Only one city will win the bid. But at the moment, only one city is threatening to build a stadium that may lose much of its theoretical purpose and glamour and persuasiveness in the first week of July.

HEADLINE: Learn for Learning's Sake

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''College Degree Still Pays but It's Leveling Off'' (Business Day, Jan. 13):
 Your analysis of the ''value'' of college degrees once again proves that America has some true learning to do before it can catch up to the intellectual level of the rest of the industrialized world. 
 I am tired of opening the newspaper at least once a year to find an article that basically reduces college education to a question of economics.
 Given the intellectual paucity of the American high school experience, all Americans should be going to college to finally learn something, regardless of whether that newfound knowledge increases their salaries. 
 Prof. Harley Shaken, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley, argues in the article that the ''obsession with education'' overshadows attempts to equalize incomes by other means, and he is undoubtedly right. 
 If Americans were to stop thinking of education as a means to an end, maybe it wouldn't be constantly cheapened in this way.
 Yes, please raise the minimum wage, enact something like the Equal Rights Amendment and strengthen unions. At the same time, strengthen education by reminding all Americans that a sound education is an end in itself.

To the Editor:
 Because of strong opposition led by the AARP, it seems unlikely that a majority in both houses of Congress will pass President Bush's proposal to partly privatize Social Security. Here's an alternate way to partly privatize Social Security. 
 Current law requires that the Social Security trust fund consist entirely of United States Treasury securities. All we need to do is change the law so that it may also buy corporate stocks and bonds. While the trust fund would now bear some risk, it would also stand to reap a higher return on its investment.
 Better yet, in 2042, the year the administration says the trust fund will be depleted, retirees would still be able to collect full benefits.

HEADLINE: Behold The Artful Price Tag

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

 BODY:
YOU'VE read the same exciting story about design for years. As it goes, corporate America recognizes design as a point of difference, a sales edge, an emotional connection to buyers.
 And buyers recognize design as fashion, coolness, lifestyle.
 ''The big D,'' as Bruce Claxton, a designer, called it.
 Companies like Apple Computer exemplified both sides of the thinking. With a series of highly design-conscious introductions like the candy-colored iMac and the milk-white iBook -- products with looks that had the hummability of pop songs -- Apple set itself apart. And consumers responded as a cult, which grew, culminating in the iPod, the personal music player, which quadrupled the company's first-quarter profit this year and increased Apple's revenue by 74 percent. 
 But the design excitement last week in Apple's latest introductions, the Mac Mini and iPod Shuffle, was not in the Mini's small simple box or the Shuffle's stick-of-gum wand. It was in the prices: $499 and $99.
 In a conversation on Monday, Jonathan Ive, the company's vice president for industrial design, described Apple's newest generation of designs less by how they look than what he termed ''a whole new level of access to the product.'' 
 This was not Apple's traditional design card, played at a premium for its core audience, a group that an editorial in The Times on Jan. 13 about Apple's move toward the mainstream called ''the lonely elite'' (a phrase that despite the media buzz still adequately describes most of the interest in design). 
 The important feature of Apple's new designs was the price, not design as something you could not live without but, paradoxically, design as something you might finally be able to live with. Does design, too, have to think different now? As Apple reaches for a mass market, as yet out of hand, is it dropping the ball on design? 
 ''The most affordable Mac ever,'' Apple.com, the company's online store, announced. And the iPod Shuffle was pictured next to a package of bubble gum, as though to suggest that at $99 you could stuff it into your mouth and chew it for a while, then spit it out when it lost its flavor.
 Eric Chan, the founder and president of Ecco Design, whose clients include Best Buy and Toyota, said: ''Design has become a commodity now, and the price has to come down. Even the Chinese are shipping us pretty reasonable design.'' On the ability of design to command a premium or drive a business, Mr. Chan added: ''Coolness is overhyped. Apple was smart enough to do the high end first and then come down to this and connect both points. The new economy won't make money from the rich. Look at IM messages. It's a huge market on nickels and dimes on every minute.''
 Tucker Viemeister, a designer and the president of Springtime USA, whose clients include Volkswagen and Heineken Breweries, concurred.
 ''Price trumps design every day of the week,'' he said. Mr. Viemeister cited an observation of Tocqueville, whom he is reading. ''Americans care more about function than looks. This is not a new situation.''
 Mr. Chan commissioned a survey of 200 people to learn what consumers identify with in a purchase.
 ''The fashion end is getting less important,'' he explained. ''People want the feel-good end: ecology or comfort or genuine use.'' Mr. Chan said that businesses like Whole Foods and American Apparel, which are perceived less as brands or labels than as intelligent generics, came out very high in the ratings of those surveyed.
 ''Too much superficial design was not good,'' he added of their conclusions.
 Scott Henderson, an independent designer who has worked at Smart Design, was comic on the subject of design as a perennial ingenue.
 ''Good design as a 'new thing' is a sad concept,'' Mr. Henderson said sadly.
 Transparency is a word being used by design professionals. It might translate as a new, lower profile, like that of the Mac Mini, which even its creator, Mr. Ive, described innocuously as ''nice.''
 Bruce Claxton, who is the senior director of design integration at Motorola and chairman of the Industrial Designers Society of America, said that the physical appeal consumers quickly associate with design could ''become more invisible, more transparent.'' In other words, you look through the design rather than at it and, it is hoped, register a product's appeal on a less conscious level. You still reach for your wallet; you just don't argue with yourself about whether it is a frivolous, design-driven purchase. 
 Rather than design excitement, ''design provides the focus of the product, of a particular lifestyle,'' Mr. Claxton suggested of this next phase of product marketing. Citing the success of the iPod, he said that he believed industries like personal electronics would ''emerge past industrial design to design of a total activity,'' providing devices like cellphones or music players that sold not a style but a point of entry to a stylish experience. And at a price. Was Apple once again a seer in the design world, or reading the writing on the wall?
 ''When you resonate well -- design with lifestyle -- people will pay more, but not enough people pay well,'' Mr. Claxton said. ''The business saturates, and you have to expand your base. You drive up aspirations, then you move down the food chain, to the less expensive models.'' Mr. Claxton mentioned BMW's 1 Series compact cars, introduced last year. The company has shelved plans to sell the series in the United States, sticking to the luxury sales strategy that Apple abandoned last week. Target, the chain of stores now inextricably associated with a business philosophy that integrates a belief in design with its corporate image and performance, unveiled its latest television advertising campaign during the Golden Globe awards on Sunday.
 ''Expect more. Pay less,'' the spot concludes in a tagline, after a cavalcade of design-related imagery. The word ''design'' floats across the screen, making acrostics with other stylish concepts, like a beautiful person's daydreams coming into view.
 But Target, which has commissioned product collections from design celebrities like Michael Graves and Philippe Starck, is also taking a different tack now, quietly lowering the volume on a message that it thinks no longer requires noise and concentrating on ''nondesign'' design. 
 ''We helped build the case,'' said Michael Francis, executive vice president for marketing, about design in the mass marketplace. ''Now it's time to take it a step further. Not all design is high design.'' Mr. Francis used as an example Target's Archer Farms spring water, introduced three months ago, and other grocery items on their way to stores.
 ''We've shifted away from one designer with a point of view,'' he said. ''We spent a lot of time with design partners that will inform thinking on the packaging that will never bear those designers' names.''
 With a mass marketplace that now recognizes design when it sees it, though it refuses to pay for it, Apple's risk is very real. It has stretched its enviable earpod cord out on the block. Only a company with design charisma can make a price exciting, as Apple now knows, and would do well to remember.
 ''I don't think Apple's product cost reduction is a new industry trend or design watering-down,'' Dan Harden wrote by e-mail. Mr. Harden is a designer whose company, Whipsaw Inc., designed the Rio Carbon MP3 player, which competes with iPod. ''It's Apple joining the rest of the real world. I just hope they remain a beacon of quality.''
 Cheap on its own has never had much of a name.

HEADLINE: Fare Increases Adding Up to a Grumpy Ride to Work

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; John Holl contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan and other inflation-fighters may be soldiering on, but for most commuters in the New York area, the latest battle has already been lost.
 All around the region, the cost of getting to work is jumping, and the increases are easily outpacing gains in wages, according to figures compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. From mid-2003 through the middle of last year, average weekly wages in the region rose 3.2 percent, while transportation costs rose 5.7 percent. And that was before the latest round of increases.
 Connecticut residents felt the first bite of the year when their train fares rose 5.5 percent on Jan. 1. Suburban commuters in New York are facing a 5 percent fare increase two years after a 25 percent increase, as well as a rise in parking fees. Many will also pay more to ride the subway, starting Feb. 27, when the price of unlimited monthly MetroCards will go up 8.6 percent. 
 New Jersey residents are not likely to be spared. Yesterday, New Jersey Transit, which operates trains and buses in the state, proposed a fare increase that would take effect in midsummer and that would raise ticket prices an average of almost 15 percent. Just three years ago, it raised fares about 10 percent.
 George D. Warrington, the agency's executive director, said it was playing catch-up after going from 1990 until 2002 without raising prices. He said the increase was needed to bridge a projected $60.6 million gap in the operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
 But that logic is unlikely to soften the blow for the system's current users.
 Under the proposal, which must be approved by the agency's board and by Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, most people commuting into New York would pay about 13 percent more. For example, the price of a monthly train pass from Summit to Hoboken would rise to $174 from $154, while the monthly fare for buses between Perth Amboy and the Port Authority Bus Terminal would go up to $184 from $162.
 ''No one's getting this kind of pay increase, so these rising transportation costs will far outstrip the growth in wages, particularly for low-income households,'' said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
 With the economy on the rebound, economists say they expect employment and pay to rise this year, but not as fast as transit fares.
 Tony Chan, an accountant who commutes to Midtown from Manhasset, on Long Island, said he was bracing for what he called a ''triple whammy'' that will push his commuting cost up by almost 10 percent in March. Mr. Chan, 30, rides the Long Island Rail Road to Pennsylvania Station, then catches a subway. The prices of both the monthly train pass and the MetroCard are going up, and the discount he receives for buying them together is shrinking. In his case, it is a double triple-whammy, because his wife, Alice, also an accountant, has the same commute. Together, they will pay more than $490 a month, up from about $447 now.
 ''When I add it up, it's a lot; it's close to $6,000 a year,'' said Mr. Chan, who declined to reveal their income. ''I'm pretty fortunate, but I still feel it with everything else going up, like health insurance co-payments.''
 Rae Rosen, a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the overall effect of the fare increases would be muted because the local economy was strong and growing. While the increases are not likely to push many workers or jobs away from New York, there is too much slack in the job market for workers to demand immediate raises to cover their higher monthly expenses, she said.
 ''On the middle and upper ends, I think you're going to see very little impact,'' she said. Most families like Mr. Chan's will simply have less disposable income, she said.
 Of course, those who drive to work are seeing an even higher increase in transportation costs because of the high cost of gasoline, which has hovered above $1.70 a gallon for months. But if they drive to the train station, they are also paying higher parking fees. Metro-North Railroad is raising fees at some stations along its lines in Westchester and Putnam Counties, starting next month. Irvington residents will pay about $440 a year, up from about $300, for example.
 The pending fare increase on Metro-North, which will take effect at the end of February, will be the second in two years, pushing fares more than 30 percent higher than they were in early 2003. The monthly fare from Goldens Bridge, on the Harlem line, for example, will go up to $251 from $239. 
 But Metro-North officials have pointed out that the railroad has gone more than seven years without an increase.
 Indeed, the 1990's were a sort of golden age for suburban commuters in New York and New Jersey. The economic boom that ran for most of the decade drove up incomes and housing values year after year, but transportation costs rarely budged.
 Metro-North raised fares just once between January 1990 and May 2003. New Jersey Transit's 10 percent increase in April 2002 was its first since July 1990. Adjusted for inflation, Mr. Warrington said, its fares are lower than ever.
 Mr. Zandi said transit agencies in Philadelphia and many other cities were in a similar situation.
 ''This is a phenomenon that is happening in many parts of the country,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''There are big budget holes at the state and local level, so they're cutting back on subsidies and grants they give to transportation. And this is all happening before wages really start to rise.''
 Mr. Zandi said that over time, wage increases would accelerate, diluting the impact of these sharp increases in commuting costs.
 In New Jersey Transit's case, during the 12 years when it did not raise fares, it papered over its annual operating shortfall by transferring money from its capital budget.
 Mr. Warrington has been paring administrative costs at the agency since he arrived in 2002, but the costs of fuel, employee health care and security have risen. The agency has also added light-rail service along the Hudson River and in the Trenton area and has improved rail connections to Penn Station in Midtown.
 While raising fares, New Jersey Transit wants to ease commuters' ability to move among the different modes of transportation. Mr. Warrington proposed allowing holders of monthly train passes a free transfer to the light-rail systems or to a bus on one leg of their trips.
 The plan received support from Jack Lettiere, New Jersey's transportation commissioner, and two other members of the agency's board, John L. McGoldrick and Patrick W. Parkinson, and all said they would listen to riders at the 13 public hearings scheduled for February.
 Mr. Lettiere called it ''a good first step,'' but Kelley Heck, a spokeswoman for Mr. Codey, said yesterday that he thought the proposed increases were ''a bit high'' and would like to see them reduced in favor of a bigger cut in expenses.
 Commuter advocates who spoke at the board's meeting yesterday demanded that the state raise its tax on gasoline to help subsidize mass transit before raising fares again, but workers at Penn Station in Newark expressed resignation.
 Crystal Jones, 29, who was on her way to work as a waitress in Manhattan, said, ''Public hearings are nice, but commuters know the reality. When Jersey Transit announces a fare increase, it's going to happen no matter what.''

HEADLINE: Don't Know Much About Algebra

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard, has been pilloried for suggesting that women may be biologically unsuited to succeed at mathematics.
 He may have a point.
 Just look at Condoleezza Rice.
 She's clearly a well-educated, intelligent woman, versed in Brahms and the Bolsheviks, who has just been rewarded for her loyalty with the most plum assignment in the second Bush cabinet. 
 Yet her math skills are woefully inadequate.
 She can't do simple equations. She doesn't even know that X times zero equals zero. If you multiply 1,370 dead soldiers times zero weapons of mass destruction, that equals zero achievement for Ms. Rice, who helped the president and vice president bamboozle the country into war.
 Was Condi out doing figure eights at the ice skating rink when she should have been home learning her figures? She couldn't have spent much time studying classic word problems: If two trains leave Chicago at noon, one going south at 20 miles an hour and one going north at 30 miles an hour, how far will each have gotten by midnight? 
 Otherwise, she might have realized that if two cars leave the Baghdad airport at noon on the main highway into the capital of Iraq, neither one is going to get there with any living passengers. Our 22 months at war have not added up to that one major highway's being secured.
 It's lucky for Ms. Rice that she's serving with men who are just as lame at numbers as she is. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz couldn't be bothered to tally correctly the number of dead soldiers when he testified before Congress. And his boss, Donald Rumsfeld, didn't realize that using an autopen signature on more than 1,000 letters to the relatives of fallen troops added up to zero solace.
 Our new top diplomat has obviously not mastered fractions. When she asserted during her confirmation hearing that 120,000 Iraqi troops had been trained, Senator Joe Biden corrected her, saying she was off by a bit. His calculation of trained Iraqi troops was actually 4,000 -- hers was 30 times that. Maybe she's confusing hyperbole and hypotenuse.
 Her geometry is skewed if she thinks she'll now be more powerful than Rummy and Dick Cheney. Doesn't she know that the Pentagon has more sides than her Crawford triangle with George and Laura?
 She could at least have read ''The Da Vinci Code.'' Then she would have learned about Fibonacci numbers, a recurring mathematical pattern in nature. When you invade a country, you should expect an insurgency. Or, as Fibonacci might have calculated it, if you kill one jihadist, two more arrive to take his place; if you kill three, five more pop up; if you get five, eight more appear, and so on.
 The incoming secretary of state and her colleagues are, alas, also lousy at economics. After Bush officials promised that the postwar expenses would be covered by Iraqi oil revenues, we find ourselves spending $1 billion a week of our own money.
 Ms. Rice and her fellow imperialists know so little about physics that they arrogantly jumped into ''spooky action at a distance,'' turning the country they had hoped to make into a model democracy into a training ground for international terrorists, a nucleus for a new generation of radioactively dangerous fanatics.
 How could they forget Newton's third law: for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction?
 The administration needs a lesson in subtraction. How do we subtract our troops and replace them with Iraqi troops while the terrorists keep subtracting Iraqi troops with car bombs and rocket-propelled grenades?
 Condi may not know Einstein's theory of relativity, but she has a fine grasp of Cheney's theory of moral relativity. Because they're the good guys, they can do anything: dissembling to get into war; flattening Iraqi cities to save them; replacing the Geneva Conventions with unconventional ways of making prisoners talk. The only equation the Bushies know is this one: Might = Right. 
 It is puzzling that if you add X (no exit strategy) to Y (Why are we there?) you get W2: George Bush's second inauguration. 
 At Condi's hearing, she justified the Bush administration's misadventures by saying history would prove it right. ''I know enough about history to stand back and to recognize that you judge decisions not at the moment, but in how it all adds up,'' she told a skeptical Senator Biden.
 Problem is, she's calculating, but she can't add. For now, Sam Cooke is right about the Bushies. They don't know much about history.

HEADLINE: What Rises In the West? Uncertainty

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
THE City Council adopted the Bloomberg administration's ambitious plan yesterday for the Far West Side of Manhattan, the Hudson Yards. What does the vote portend?
 This would seem an opportune time to remind New Yorkers who may be confused that they are not alone. Nobody ever knows quite what's going on in New York. 
 In most other places, people think in straight lines. A plan turns into the bricks and mortar of a building or a stadium or a convention center. In New York, it might turn into something that bears little resemblance to the original -- after a long and often brutal game of three-dimensional Monopoly. With so much at stake -- jobs, investment, political futures, fortunes -- plans on their first outings are generally starting points.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a deputy mayor, Daniel L. Doctoroff, got their zoning plan on the board in record time. And now? ''Westway, Times Square, Battery Park City, Queens West -- the first plan never happens,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association. ''They always get mired down in controversy, litigation and delay. It takes the second or third plan.'' 
 For instance, the administration has linked the Hudson Yards to its proposed Jets stadium and convention center, across 11th Avenue on the Hudson; Mr. Bloomberg contends that the stadium plan will jump-start development in the area. 
 But the stadium's fate depends on the economy, on the outcome of lawsuits, maybe on the status of the city's bid for the 2012 summer Olympics, on some still murky details about financing and on the Jets' real timetable, since its lease at the Meadowlands expires in 2008. If development is delayed, does the team have a point of no return? 
 The stadium's future also relies on the politics of Albany, where each of the three men in that infamous room has a veto. Gov. George E. Pataki supports the plan, but Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, says he is undecided. The Senate leader, Joseph Bruno, is officially undecided, too, but is expected to go along with his fellow Republican, the governor. It's Mr. Silver's Monopoly move. 
 And then there is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the land where the stadium would rise and would be charging the Jets for development rights. The transportation agency, which has commissioned an appraisal, hasn't set a price yet.
 With the authority in its own financial straits, it will presumably try to get as much as it can, or be prepared to explain why it did not. The authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, could find himself caught between Mr. Pataki and pressure to ask top dollar from the Jets or risk harsh criticism. What price would be too high? 
 If the stadium and convention center are a no-go, what impact would that have on the extension of the No. 7 subway line, which City Hall reasonably considers central to the area's development?
 The city sees the Hudson Yards as a mini-city: 42 blocks of commercial and residential development. But beyond public investment in a new boulevard and some parkland, the rest would be up to real estate developers. They prefer it if the economy, the market and the courts cooperate. 
 Will they? 
 The revival of Times Square is a helpful precedent. Its transformation from smutty to flashy took 21 years and seven variations on ever-changing plans. The first plan back in the late 1970's bears little resemblance to the lively tourist-and-entertainment center that Times Square is today. 
 IN fact, the once-blighted area revived purely unpredictably. The city and state kept revising their vision for Times Square, reflecting changing interests and finances. The state fought lawsuits, condemned properties to make way for development and issued plans that focused for a decade on sterile office buildings. 
 Then the sensibility shifted to boldly lighted entertainment uses: government set the newest ground rules, then stepped back while developers took over. From then on, the market created the tourist and entertainment magnet that Times Square has been for the last five years.
 It's the principle of the second man, as some in the city's development world call it. Or maybe the third man. Times Square's comeback spanned the administrations of three mayors and three governors.
 The Hudson Yards plan has moved unusually rapidly. ''The mayor and Dan Doctoroff are to be congratulated for getting the zoning approval this quickly,'' Mr. Yaro of the Regional Plan Association said. ''It's the city's economic future.'' Emphasis, of course, on the word future.

HEADLINE: Council Approves West Side Rezoning Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The City Council gave formal approval yesterday to the Bloomberg administration's plan to rezone a large swath of the Far West Side for office towers, housing, parks and a new boulevard.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said that the city's economic future depends on transforming the 42-block neighborhood of warehouses, factories and tenements into a vibrant office and residential district over the next 30 years. He has linked the rezoning to a separate proposal to build a $1.4 billion stadium for the Jets on the Far West Side, which has prompted opposition from local residents, elected officials and some business leaders. 
 In a compromise with Council leaders 10 days ago, the administration agreed that 25 percent of the proposed 13,600 new apartments would be for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. The Council also agreed to reduce the total cost of the 30-year plan by $1 billion to $3 billion by appropriating money from the city's operating budget to pay interest every year for the first decade.
 At the same time, the Council severed connections between the redevelopment plan and the proposed stadium, which is not part of the new zoning but is a major and highly contentious element of the mayor's master plan.
 ''This is a historic rezoning which re-imagines what the entire Midtown of Manhattan could be,'' said Gifford Miller, the Council speaker.
 ''Not a dime goes to a stadium,'' he added. ''That isn't in the best interests of the city.''
 The mayor was even more ebullient. He called the vote an ''enormous win for New Yorkers in all five boroughs.'' 
 The action yesterday follows the State Legislature's vote in December to approve a second element of the West Side plan: the $1.4 billion expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The mayor said he hoped the stadium itself would be approved next month.
 The Empire State Development Corporation is expected to approve the stadium project at its meeting next Thursday. The project then moves to Albany and the Public Authorities Control Board, a three-person panel controlled by the governor and legislative leaders.
 It is unclear what will happen there. Both Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate leader, Joseph L. Bruno, have expressed misgivings about the stadium. Yesterday, John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said, ''The jury is still out.''
 The city and the state have said they will invest $300 million each in the stadium project, with the Jets putting up $800 million and covering any cost overruns. But the city may face a fight over its share. It has said it will divert annual payments in lieu of taxes that are made to the city by developers to pay for the stadium. Councilwoman Christine Quinn said the Council was looking into the legal viability of using those payments, most of which go into the city's operating budget.
 Stadium opponents have also filed two lawsuits challenging the stadium on environmental grounds. Both sides expect another lawsuit claiming that the city's using income tax revenues in the West Side financial plan is illegal.

HEADLINE: Health Nominee Tells Panel He Knows of No Plans to Curb Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Michael O. Leavitt, President Bush's nominee for secretary of health and human services, told a Senate committee Wednesday that ''Medicaid is flawed and inefficient,'' but said he knew of no plans to replace it with a lump-sum payment, or block grant, to control costs.
 State officials and health policy analysts have been expecting Mr. Bush to propose some kind of block grant in place of the open-ended entitlement to benefits that Medicaid now provides.
 But Mr. Leavitt said, ''I know of no block grant proposal that would come to you.'' 
 He made the statement at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid and Medicare, the giant health insurance programs for more than 80 million people who are poor, disabled or elderly.
 Members of both parties expressed relief at Mr. Leavitt's comments. But he left himself plenty of wiggle room, suggesting that the administration might again propose a limit on federal spending for some Medicaid recipients or some types of services, which he described as optional.
 Echoing his comments before another Senate committee on Tuesday, Mr. Leavitt said state officials needed more freedom and flexibility to reshape Medicaid, trim benefits and expand or cut back eligibility. Medicaid, he said, provides benefits much more generous than those typically available under private health insurance.
 ''This society needs to provide high-quality basic health care to its needy,'' Mr. Leavitt testified. But, he said, ''it would be better for all to have high-quality basic health care than for a few to have a benefit package unmatched by anyone else in society.''
 In general, Medicaid spending rises automatically with the number of recipients and the costs of medical care. The federal government and the states together spend more than $300 billion a year on the program, and governors say it is crowding out other items in state budgets.
 Under federal law, states that participate in Medicaid must cover some groups, including pregnant women and children with incomes below certain levels. States are allowed to cover other groups. The optional beneficiaries include some of the more vulnerable people on Medicaid: for example, an 85-year-old widow with income of $850 a month or a pregnant woman with income of $15,000 a year. 
 In 1997, when he was governor of Utah, Mr. Leavitt said that he and other governors adamantly opposed ''a cap on federal Medicaid spending in any form.'' But on Wednesday he left open the possibility that he might now accept some type of cap on spending for optional services or optional groups.
 ''Mandatory populations should remain mandatory,'' he said repeatedly in response to questions. ''Optional coverage should remain optional. Optional populations should remain optional.''
 Senators and governors of both parties have criticized proposals to give states fixed amounts of Medicaid money, set in advance, each year. 
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said that block grants, fixed allotments of money or caps on spending would cripple states' ability to respond to changes in the economy and to increases in the number of uninsured.
 ''It's an indeterminate number of people who might be in need,'' Ms. Snowe told Mr. Leavitt. A block grant or a cap on spending, she said, ''would shift costs to the states and would undermine support for the neediest people in the country.''
 Mr. Leavitt was Utah governor for more than 10 years and has been administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the last 14 months. He says he wants to give states more discretion and flexibility.
 But Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said: ''Caps on federal Medicaid spending will reduce flexibility, not increase it. And it is this flexibility that has allowed a swift response to recessions, epidemics, disasters like 9/11 and treatment innovations.''
 Senators of both parties said Mr. Leavitt was well qualified and would easily win confirmation from the Senate within a few days.
 Mr. Leavitt assured Congress that he would not take action against federal employees who exposed problems at the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
 In November, a federal drug safety reviewer, Dr. David J. Graham, told the committee that the F.D.A. was ''virtually incapable of protecting America'' against unsafe drugs. Last March the chief actuary of the Medicare program, Richard S. Foster, said he had been forbidden to give Congress data showing that the cost of a new drug benefit might far exceed official estimates.
 Also on Wednesday, President Bush's nominee for energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, promised to work toward opening the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling, telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that he would be an ''energetic advocate for the proposal,'' which has sharply divided Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.
 Dr. Bodman, a deputy Treasury secretary and former chemical and financial industry executive, is expected to be confirmed. Although many Democrats have opposed Alaskan oil drilling, two Democratic committee members, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, said Tuesday that they would vote to confirm Dr. Bodman. 
 The Associated Press reported Wednesday that the senator who had blocked the nomination of Margaret Spellings to be education secretary had relented. The lawmaker, Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said he agreed to allow a vote after Ms. Spellings promised to review tactics for the promotion of department programs.

HEADLINE: Public Voicing Doubts on Iraq And the Economy, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
On the eve of President Bush's second inauguration, most Americans say they do not expect the economy to improve or American troops to be withdrawn from Iraq by the time Mr. Bush leaves the White House, and many have reservations about his signature plan to overhaul Social Security, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 Seventy percent, however, said they thought Mr. Bush would succeed in changing the Social Security system. The poll found that 43 percent of respondents expect most forms of abortion to be illegal by the time Mr. Bush leaves the White House, given Mr. Bush's expected appointments to the Supreme Court.
 The Times/CBS News Poll offered the kind of conflicting portrait of the nation's view of Mr. Bush that was evident throughout last year's presidential campaign. Nearly 60 percent of respondents said they were generally optimistic on the eve of Mr. Bush's swearing-in about the next four years, but clear majorities disapproved of Mr. Bush's management of the economy and the war in Iraq. 
 Nearly two-thirds said a second Bush term would leave the country with a larger deficit, while 47 percent said that a second Bush term would divide Americans. A majority of those surveyed said that they did not expect any improvement in health care, education, or in reducing the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly by January 2009.
 Just under 80 percent, including a majority of those who said they voted for Mr. Bush in November, said it would not be possible to overhaul Social Security, cut taxes, and finance the war in Iraq without increasing the budget deficit, despite Mr. Bush's promises to the contrary.
 The findings, coming after a tensely competitive election, suggest that Mr. Bush does not have broad popular support as he embarks on what the White House has signaled would be an extraordinarily ambitious second term, which in many ways will commence with Mr. Bush's swearing-in and speech on Thursday. That could undermine his leverage in Congress, where even some Republicans have expressed concern about major aspects of Mr. Bush's Social Security plans.
 Mr. Bush's job approval rating is at 49 percent as he heads into his second term -- significantly lower than the ratings at the start of the second terms of the last two presidents who served eight years, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. And 56 percent said the country has gone off on the wrong track, about as bad a rating Mr. Bush has received on this measure since entering the White House.
 Still, as Mr. Bush enters what the White House views as a critical two-year window before his power begins to wane, the poll suggests that Mr. Bush's effort to lay the groundwork to reshape the Social Security system has had some success.
 Fifty percent said Social Security is in crisis, echoing an assertion that Mr. Bush has made and that has been disputed by Democrats and independent analysts.
 Answering another question, 51 percent said that while there were good things about Social Security, the system needed ''fundamental changes,'' while 24 percent said it needed a complete overhaul.
 But 50 percent said it was a ''bad idea'' to permit workers to divert part of their payroll taxes into the stock market, as Mr. Bush is expected to propose. That number leaps to 70 percent when the question includes the possibility that future guaranteed benefits would be reduced by as much as one-third. 
 Nearly 60 percent of respondents said they were not likely to put their own Social Security money into the stock market, and a majority said that in pushing for a Social Security overhaul, Mr. Bush was more interested in helping Wall Street than protecting the average American. 
 ''I think it's a bad idea,'' said Tina DeSantis, 46, of Pennsylvania, who identified herself as a Republican. ''People that I've encountered don't necessarily have the tools necessary to make proper decisions with them and end up losing money.''
 And Ilene Bernards, 46, a Republican from Clinton, Utah, said she feared that permitting people to invest in private accounts would end up destabilizing the system. 
 ''We would be farther in the hole than we already are with Social Security, because at some point if people use their money and lose it and they're old, then somebody is still going to have to take care of them,'' Ms. Bernards said.
 The nationwide telephone poll was taken Friday through Tuesday with 1,118 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 The poll suggests that in some ways, many Americans are expecting Mr. Bush to succeed in making major changes in the political landscape over the next four years. 
 That is most notable on the question of abortion; 71 percent expect Mr. Bush to appoint Supreme Court justices who will vote to outlaw abortion. 
 A majority of Americans, 71 percent, support some forms of legal abortion, albeit some with more restrictions than now exist.
 Tony Rhoden, 53, an independent from Queens, said of the president regarding abortion: ''He is against it, so obviously whatever judges he picks are going to be ruling in his favor. He wants someone who thinks the way he does. It seems to me that with everybody he's putting into place whatever he wants, they're going to get for him.''
 The poll also found that concern about the war in Iraq is rising: 75 percent said Mr. Bush had no clear plan for getting out of Iraq, a sharp jump up from 58 percent last fall, and a majority said that he routinely exaggerated conditions there.
 And 75 percent said they believe a significant number of American troops will still be stationed in Iraq when Mr. Bush leaves the presidency.
 The poll also found that 53 percent of Americans think the war in Iraq will not have been worth the loss of American life if unconventional weapons are never found. 
 A majority of respondents said that Iraq, which has been plagued by violence over the last week, is not secure enough to proceed with elections in two weeks, as scheduled.
 However, the respondents are divided over whether the elections should be postponed in the hope of some sense of order being restored there.
 In any event, only 15 percent of respondents said that elections would produce a decline in violence in Iraq; 40 percent said it would create more violence.
 Respondents do not appear to share Mr. Bush's concern about the urgency of the Social Security problem, in the context of other problems facing the nation.
 Asked to name the most important problem facing the country, just 3 percent named Social Security, while 11 percent named Iraq and Osama bin Laden, and 10 percent identified ''war'' and the economy.
 Still, 54 percent of respondents said they do not expect the Social Security system to have enough money to pay them pensions when they retire, a figure that has not varied much since the Times/CBS News Poll started asking the question in 1981. 
 And younger people were much more likely to support the change Mr. Bush is seeking than older Americans.
 On taxes, another area where the Bush administration is expected to make a major effort over the next four years, 54 percent said investment and interest income should be taxed at the same rate as wages.
 Republicans have been moving to reduce the tax on investments and interest as a way of overhauling the tax system and encouraging business investment. 
 At the same time, by a margin of 47 to 40 percent, Americans think that temporary tax cuts that were passed in 2001, and are due to expire this year, should be made permanent.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Friday through Tuesday with 1,118 adults throughout the United States.
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike.
 Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller sub-groups the margin of sampling error is larger.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

Family Furniture, From Way Back
 Cotton Mather, the 17th-century Puritan minister in Boston, called the colonial settlement of Newport, R.I., ''a sewer of religious contagion'' because Newport was accepting such Puritan outcasts as Baptists, Quakers, Anglicans, Jews and Unitarians. 
 Pieter Nicholson Roos, executive director of the Newport Restoration Foundation, speaking at a seminar on Rhode Island furniture last week at Sotheby's, said such open-mindedness may have contributed to Newport's economic boom of the early 1700's. 
 ''By 1740, Newport is thriving and has reached its golden age,'' he said. ''It is one of the five largest cities in North America.'' 
 Its merchants grew rich selling rum, candles, slaves and foreign goods. Unencumbered by tradition, skillful Newport cabinetmakers invented a style of their own and successfully supplied furniture to some of the richest families in Rhode Island.
 The British occupied Newport during the Revolutionary War, and it suffered a 30-year decline. Nevertheless, Newport's golden age produced some of the finest high-style pieces of furniture ever made in colonial America, much of it by craftsmen in the Goddard and Townsend families.
 Tomorrow, Sotheby's will sell some Newport furniture that has been in the same family for two centuries.
 The top lot is a Chippendale carved mahogany scalloped-top tea table attributed to John Goddard of Newport from about 1760. Leslie Keno, the top Americana specialist at Sotheby's, thinks the table was part of a suite of new furniture the Providence merchant Nicholas Brown (1721-1791) commissioned when he married Rhoda Jenckes. (Sotheby's found a tea table listed in a 1791 inventory of Brown's estate.)
 Brown was one of the richest and most powerful men in Providence. The table has descended through his family, via marriage, to the Goddards, who are selling it.
 ''We made a decision to divide up family objects seen as so important to serious collectors,'' William Goddard said. ''It was not only a problem of dividing things up equitably; we thought they would be better off in the hands of collectors. The furniture has been treated with great respect from generation to generation, but this furniture has come into its own in the past 30 to 40 years.''
 How can the family bear to sell its treasures? Mr. Goddard said he had commissioned Al Breed, a veteran cabinetmaker based in South Berwick, Maine, to duplicate certain pieces. Last summer, Mr. Breed made a copy of the tea table, which is nearly 27 inches high with a top that is 33 by 19.5 inches. The estimate for the elegant table at Sotheby's is $2 million to $5 million. 
 Asked about its appeal, Mr. Breed said: ''It is the design, not the wood or finish, that makes it so. You don't have to be a scholar to love it; that's the sign of a great piece.''
 Mr. Breed said that in making the copy, he considered why the design was so successful. ''It's the symmetrical ogee curves,'' he said, referring to a double curve that is sometimes called a Cupid's bow. ''The cabinetmaker took a motif, the ogee curve, to its logical design conclusion without overdoing it.''
 Referring to the top of the table, he noted: ''The double curve is repeated eight times. On the side, on the short end of the apron, you see the same curve on the bottom edge. And when you flip that curve up to the vertical plain, you get more ogee curves that swell in and out.''
 Making the copy proved difficult.
 ''Getting the subtleties of the proportions of the leg right was hard,'' Mr. Breed said. ''The table has a certain delicate stance to it. The way the leg transitions to the knee is what gives it that 'wow' factor.''
 Sotheby's explained its appeal differently. ''There are four factors to evaluating a piece,'' Mr. Keno said. ''Quality, rarity, condition and provenance. This tea table has very high doses of each.''
 ''It's a symphony of curves,'' he continued. ''The sides of the case roll, like waves breaking against the sand, and the grain of the wood is carefully choreographed to go with it.''
 The carver has even cut out openings between the talons and the ball they grip (inspired by a Chinese dragon clutching a pearl). 
 Concerning rarity, ''the table is one of a handful of tea tables attributed to John Goddard,'' Mr. Keno said. The catalog illustrates similar examples at the Winterthur Museum in Delaware and in the Bayou Bend Collection in Houston.
 Wood on a 250-year-old table normally shows signs of movement. ''The top hasn't split because chestnut blocks placed under it have allowed it to breathe,'' Mr. Keno said. ''Shellac on the underside may also have saved it from warping or splitting.''
 The table shows few signs of wear. ''It was not stripped,'' said Albert Sack, the dean of the Americana dealers. ''It was cleaned but not really refinished. It has its original golden color.''
 Mr. Keno said: ''It has been polished and lovingly cared for, as any masterpiece would be. It was one of the family jewels.'' 
 Sotheby's catalog documents the long provenance. ''The table has survived this well because it has stayed in the same house since 1803,'' Mr. Keno said. 
 Coincidentally, Christie's Americana sale today includes a rare New York marble-top pier table that has equally sexy ogee curves and a fine provenance. The Cortelyou family Chippendale carved mahogany table, 1750-1770, is one of very few serpentine tables that survive from colonial New York.
 Though the carver is unknown, the table has elegant proportions, S-shaped carved legs and claw-and-ball feet. It retains both its antique surface and its original highly figured, black-and-white marble top.
 ''The rarity of having the original marble top cannot be overemphasized,'' said Todd Prickett, a second-generation Pennsylvania dealer in fine Americana. The table's estimate is $800,000 to $1.2 million. John Hays, the Americana expert at Christie's, thinks the pier table and a Chippendale mahogany bonnet-top chest-on-chest from about 1772 are the ''sleepers'' in today's sale.
 The tall chest, thought to be the only documented piece of furniture made by Thomas Townsend of Newport, comes from the considerable estate of Robert David Lion Gardiner, the owner of the 3,000-acre Gardiners Island off eastern Long Island. Mr. Hays said it had probably been in the Gardiner family since 1772, when the sixth proprietor of Gardiners Island built a new house there. The estimate is $500,000 to $800,000.

102 Minutes
The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers
By Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn
Illustrated. 322 pages. Henry Holt and Times Books. $26.
 Perhaps the strangest thing about the destruction of the World Trade Center towers, for many of us who lived through the attack and its aftermath in New York, is how unreal it all seems now. Already, the events of Sept. 11, 2001, often feel as if they took place in the distant past. And yet all it takes is the smallest reminder -- a low-bearing plane, a National Guardsman patrolling Grand Central Terminal, a whiff of jet fuel like the smell that pervaded Lower Manhattan for months afterward -- and one is plunged immediately into the same emotions that gripped us at the time: horror, grief, shock, rage.
 In ''102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers,'' Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn evoke all these responses, and more. Mr. Dwyer, a reporter for The New York Times and the author or coauthor of two other books on New York (including one on the 1993 attempt to blow up the trade center), and Mr. Flynn, a special projects editor and former police bureau chief at The Times, have put their experience to good use, drawing on hundreds of interviews and thousands of pages of electronic, phone and radio transmissions and oral histories. What they have produced is a masterpiece of reporting. 
 Not all of ''102 Minutes'' was truly ''untold,'' but it is a remarkably comprehensive account of what went on inside the trade center that day, distilled to an amazingly coherent 261 pages of text. The authors have added charts and drawings to help readers keep track of the dozens of individuals whose plights they follow, but so vivid are their characterizations that one hardly needs to refer to such aids.
 Their style is invariably succinct and understated; like all the best reporters, they let the story they have dug out speak for itself. 
 ''102 Minutes'' is a book riveting enough to be read in a sitting, but I suspect that many readers will find it too emotionally debilitating to do so. It contains one story after another of harrowing escapes, immense heroism and heart-rending loss. Take the experience of Liz Thompson and Geoffrey Wharton, who became the last people out of the Windows on the World restaurant because a man happened to hold an elevator door for them. Or Jan Demczur, a window washer stuck in an elevator on the 50th floor of the north tower when the first plane hit and who, with five other men, cut his way out of the elevator shaft with the blade and handle of his squeegee.
 Frank De Martini, the ebullient Port Authority construction manager, with his crew of Pete Negron, Carlos DaCosta and Pablo Ortiz, performed herculean labors, saving at least 70 people in the north tower and even radioing out the first, ominous reports of the damage the fire was causing to the building's steel (reports that appear to have gone largely unheeded).
 Then there are Abe Zelmanowitz, who stayed with his paralyzed, wheelchair-bound friend Ed Beyea to the end; the 24-year-old security guard Robert Gabriel Martinez, who was assigned to the 78th floor of the south tower only because he was a few minutes late to work that day and refused to abandon his post; and the 72-year-old Port Authority construction inspector Tony Savas, who, after being trapped in a smoky elevator for half an hour, bounded out asking, ''What do you need me to do?'' and who insisted, when he was finally rescued, ''I've got a second wind.'' 
 Again and again, one finds oneself moved to the point of tears by the smallest things. A conversation between a person trapped in a tower and a loved one; the mere fact that several of the firms in the center preferred to hire friends and relatives; the account of a firefighter, Danny Suhr, who is mentioned only once in the narrative, killed by a falling body before he could even get into the south tower. The pictures of those who didn't make it, even the simple diagrams showing the outlines of the planes where they hit and dissolved into the buildings, are nearly as heart-wrenching. 
 Mr. Dwyer and Mr. Flynn's story is an intensely human, personal one. And yet it also draws them inevitably into the question of whether or not some part of this calamity might have been ameliorated. This is where the rage comes in. 
 Of the 2,749 people thought to have been killed in the attack, the authors estimate that at least 1,500, ''and possibly many more,'' survived the initial plane crashes but died because they could not get out of the towers before they collapsed. They attribute this to the design of the buildings themselves, and to ''a sclerotic emergency response culture in New York that resisted reform'' even after the earlier 1993 terrorist attempt to destroy the trade center. 
 The towers had been built under a New York City building code that was quietly modified in the 1960's in order to make such steel-and-glass boxes economically feasible. This was a betrayal of the city's longtime social covenant, stretching back to another of its most tragic moments, the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, in which dozens of teenage girls ended up jumping to their deaths because they were caught beyond hope of rescue by a fire in a tall building.
 Ninety years later, the authors explain, because the Port Authority was allowed to erect skyscrapers with insufficient stairways or fireproofing, victims again were forced to leap to their deaths.
 Even worse was how the police officers and especially the firefighters who rushed to the stricken towers were left mostly to their own devices by their superiors and, ultimately, by the administration of the most acclaimed public hero of 9/11, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Messrs. Dwyer and Flynn spell it out: ''The people fighting the two worst building fires in the nation's history had no video monitors. No radio communications with other agencies. No way to get reports from police helicopters and only a limited ability to communicate among themselves.''
 Mr. Giuliani, testifying before the Congressional 9/11 Commission, tried to make out that the estimated 200 firemen still in the remaining north tower at the time of its collapse had somehow received the order to evacuate but had chosen to keep helping civilians. Mr. Dwyer and Mr. Flynn find no evidence for this assertion. Nearly all the civilians who could have left the north tower were already gone, they write; the hard fact spelled out here is that most of the firefighters who died there probably had no idea the building was about to fall. 
 The courage of these men remains unsurpassed in the annals of our city. It needed no gilding from Mr. Giuliani -- especially none that conveniently obscured the failure of his own administration to properly prepare for and react to the terrorists' attack. 
 Mr. Dwyer and Mr. Flynn duly point out that ''nothing can diminish the culpability of the hijackers and their masters'' for all the death on Sept. 11. Yet if this brilliant and troubling book gives us any indication, we will probably be just as unprepared the next time.

HEADLINE: A Happy Return for Eagles Linebacker Trotter

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
As linebacker Jeremiah Trotter spoke with reporters last Sunday, wearing a mink coat and headband after Philadelphia dispatched Minnesota in a divisional playoff game, it was easy to forget that Trotter had been on the unemployment line seven months earlier, his career having unraveled as his knee once did.
 His frosty relationship with Coach Andy Reid had long grown cozy again, and his Eagles had advanced to Sunday's National Football Conference championship game here against Atlanta.
 Snow is expected this weekend, and a fourth consecutive Eagles loss in the conference title game would leave this city also buried and muffled in disconsolate grief. Whatever happens to Philadelphia, this has been a season of atonement and renewal for Trotter. 
 After two seasons in Washington, he rejoined the Eagles last summer, first as a special teams player, later as a middle linebacker who was voted to the Pro Bowl after starting only seven games.
 He is known as the Ax Man for the chopping celebration he makes after his insistent tackles, commemoration of a youth spent building massive forearms in his father's wood-cutting business in Hooks, Tex.
 Against Minnesota, Trotter made seven tackles, collected half a sack and intercepted a pass as the Eagles won, 27-14, displaying a ferocity that has been the signature of Philadelphia's defense since mid-November, when Trotter was placed at middle linebacker and Mark Simoneau was shifted to weakside linebacker.
 Trotter provides an insistent presence and an infectious personality, making him indispensable on the field and in the locker room. This is the Eagles' year, he keeps saying, believing that his faith has brought him here to finish something that he started as a younger, less mature player.
 Earlier in his career, according to Jim Johnson, the Eagles defensive coordinator, Trotter sometimes lacked restraint, straying out of position in his eagerness to make plays and build his reputation, sometimes leaving the middle open and vulnerable.
 He plays with a new discipline, Johnson and Reid said, which will be urgent on Sunday against Atlanta, the N.F.L.'s top-rushing team. The Falcons possess a threatening versatility in the roaming of quarterback Michael Vick, the cut-back skill of Warrick Dunn and the pounding of T.J. Duckett.
 ''I definitely have to have my greatest game ever,'' said Trotter, who is 6 feet 1 and weighs 262 pounds.
 So thankful is he to return to Philadelphia, Trotter said he began crying when he witnessed the frenzied cheering and towel waving at Lincoln Financial Field during player introductions last Sunday.
 He again feeds off the energy of Philadelphia's fans, but for the previous two seasons, the Eagles were the opposition as Trotter played for the Redskins, a contentious division rival. He made the Pro Bowl twice during his first stint here, then left in a bitter departure.
 In 2000, Trotter declined a five-year offer worth about $20 million from the Eagles, then grew upset when the team placed its ''franchise'' designation on him in 2001, which effectively limited his ability to move to another team, given the requirement of two first-round draft picks as compensation. Harsh words were lobbed at Reid and the Eagles' management.
 The franchise tag was removed in 2002, and Trotter signed a $36 million contract with Washington. But, Trotter has since admitted, leaving was a mistake. He never felt happy in Washington, or comfortable in the Redskins' more conservative defense. Twelve games into his career there, he tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
 While recuperating, Trotter received an unexpected phone call from Reid, with whom he had feuded in Philadelphia. His former coach wished him well, and Trotter felt appreciative.
 He played all 16 games during the 2003 season, but severe knee injuries sometimes need a full season of recovery. When Joe Gibbs replaced Steve Spurrier as coach of the Redskins after that season, Trotter became expendable. He was released in June 2004, and called Reid to inquire about a job, to thank Reid for his previous well-wishing call and to apologize for an astringent departure.
 ''I've grown up a lot,'' Trotter told reporters when he rejoined the Eagles last July, signing a contract reportedly worth $660,000, the minimum for a veteran in his seventh season. 
 ''I'm not ashamed to say I made some bad decisions. I didn't handle things the way I should have. I told him if I never see him or we never speak again, I just felt I needed to call him and tell him that.''
 In his absence, the Eagles lost twice more in the N.F.C. championship game. In retrospect, Trotter said, he believed he could have made a difference. This season, he has. And, unlike previous seasons at this point, the Eagles seem confident and relaxed as they play for a berth in the Super Bowl.
 ''Without a doubt, they were the better team both of those years'' in his absence, Trotter said. ''I don't think it was their time. That's why I believe this is the time. For some crazy reason I can't explain, I just believe this is our year.''

HEADLINE: Economic Index Points to Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Lifted by gains in stock prices and consumer confidence, the index of leading economic indicators increased 0.2 percent in December after rising a revised 0.3 percent in November, the Conference Board said yesterday.
 The rise in the index, created to chart the economy's probable direction over three to six months, supported statements this week by Federal Reserve officials that the United States is in a sustained expansion. 
The index had fallen for five consecutive months before November. 
 ''This second straight positive report is the beginning of a pattern that clearly suggests the economic expansion is real and likely to continue throughout this year,'' said Anthony Chan, an economist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio. ''It also explains why the Fed has been so confident about raising interest rates at a measured pace.'' 
 Four of the 10 indicators the board uses to derive the index contributed to the December increase, including a 2.6 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last month and the second consecutive increase in the University of Michigan's measure of consumer expectations.

HEADLINE: Increase in Quarterly Earnings for UnitedHealth Group

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
UnitedHealth Group, the nation's second-largest health insurer behind WellPoint, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings increased 46 percent after it added members through acquisitions. Profit this year will rise more than forecast, the company said.
 Net income increased to $739 million, or $1.09 a share, from $507 million, or 83 cents, the company said. 
 It was expected to earn $1.08 in the quarter, the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Revenue surged 40 percent to $10.5 billion.
 The company, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., relied on acquisitions rather than job growth to increase membership by 3.38 million last year, sending quarterly revenue past the $10 billion mark for the first time.
 UnitedHealth gained customers in New York and Washington, with deals like its $4.6 billion purchase of Oxford Health Plans in July.
 ''The best way to grow membership in a slower economy is by acquisitions, and they've done that,'' said Michael Obuchowski, a money manager at Altanes Investments in New York, which owns UnitedHealth shares. 
 ''They are in the beginning of truly benefiting from their investments of the last several years, especially in terms of employing technology to slow down the growth in health care costs.''
 Shares of UnitedHealth, the first of the big United States insurers to release fourth-quarter results, fell $1.65, or nearly 2 percent, to $86.63. 
 They rose 51 percent last year.
 ''Maybe some traders expected more of an upside,'' Mr. Obuchowski said. ''The numbers were not only strong but pointing to some really positive trends.'' 
 Shares of WellPoint fell $3.56, or 2.9 percent, to $120.04.
 UnitedHealth said profit this year would be in the range of $4.75 to $4.80 a share, 5 cents more than forecast. It earned $3.94 a share last year.
 The company said it spent about 78.8 cents of each dollar it received in premiums on medical care for members, unchanged from the fourth quarter in 2003.
 For the full year, UnitedHealth spent about a penny a premium dollar less on care compared with 2003.
 Administrative costs consumed about 15.1 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with about 16.7 percent a year earlier. 
 Increases in medical costs have begun to slow nationwide as employers shift costs to workers in the form of higher co-payments and deductibles. 
 Slowing increases in prescription drug spending have had the biggest impact on leveling off costs, according to William W. McGuire, the chief executive of UnitedHealth.
 Steven Sean Hill, a fund manager at First Investors, which has about 175,000 shares of UnitedHealth, said, ''UnitedHealth did fine.''
 The UnitedHealth divisions that focus on providing health care services for state Medicaid programs and Americans over the age of 50 had combined revenue of $9.32 billion, an increase of 44 percent from the year earlier.
 Revenue from the company's Ingenix business, which provides software that large employers can use to track changes in spending across their entire range of employee benefits programs, rose 20 percent to $214 million.

HEADLINE: 'Birth Dearth' Is Blamed For Decline In Population

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

 BODY:
Long Island is the victim of something, but is it a brain drain or a birth dearth?
 Many researchers and politicians believe it is a brain drain -- that Long Island's young adults are fleeing to New York City, the South and the Southwest in search of better jobs and cheaper homes. They cite census data from last year showing that Nassau and Suffolk Counties have lost about 140,000 18- to 34-year-olds since 1990. 
 But a study released yesterday attacked that theory, arguing that there are fewer young adults on Long Island today because fewer people had babies 20 years ago. The author of the study, Seth Forman of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, is calling the phenomenon a birth dearth.
 ''You don't need a larger explanation than that,'' Mr. Forman said. ''There is no brain drain.''
 A study released last year said that Long Island's population of young adults was declining at five times the national rate, and politicians and planners seized on the statistic. Both of the Island's county executives have called for more housing that is affordable to lower- and middle-class families to keep young couples on Long Island.
 Officials with the Rauch Foundation, which published the study, the Long Island Index, did not respond to phone messages. The foundation's 2004 study included a survey that found that 53 percent of Long Island's 18- to 34-year-olds had considered moving elsewhere because of the cost of living, high taxes and lack of housing.
 Ed Dumas, a spokesman for the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, said he disagreed with the new study, and still believed a housing shortage was forcing young adults off Long Island.
 The median home price in Nassau County is just under $450,000 and in Suffolk it is just over $350,000, according to December data from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, and Mr. Levy have argued that few young families can afford those prices.
 But Mr. Forman said people trying to decide where to settle pay more attention to the abundance of jobs, climate and where their family lives than housing costs. ''The idea that 20- to 34-year-olds are fleeing because of housing costs is manipulating the affordable housing issue,'' he said. 
 Mr. Forman said old census records showed that Long Island had 144,044 fewer infants to 9-year-olds in 1980 than in it had in 1970. The children born in 1980 have grown up, and by 2000, there were about 130,000 fewer 20 to 34-year-olds on Long Island than there were a decade earlier. It was a demographic shift mirrored across the country, the study said. But while the percentage of young adults dropped to 20 percent from 25 percent nationwide from 1990 to 2003, there was a sharper drop on Long Island, to 17.7 percent from 24 percent.

Broadway

+ 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.

++ 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.
BRANTLEY

*++ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by an Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.
BRANTLEY

*+ 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.
BRANTLEY

++ 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience to prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to David Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.
BRANTLEY

++ 'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200 Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.

* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.

*++ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.

Off Broadway

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.
BRANTLEY

*++ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.
BRANTLEY

* 'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (A K A LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212) 533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.

++ 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.

'K.I. FROM CRIME' We can all bring to mind a list of literary characters it might be edifying to spend some time with, but Katerina Ivanovna, from ''Crime and Punishment,'' probably isn't on your list. A minor figure in the novel, she is the miserable, impoverished widow of a hopeless drunk. In a grim scene, she presides over a funeral banquet for her husband. Racked with a consumptive cough, she belittles the seedy guests who have bothered to show up, fumes at the indifference of the more respectable ones who haven't, bemoans the fate of her fatherless children. Now, thanks to the wonders of the contemporary stage, you're invited. Theatergoers who delight in audience participation will not want to miss the New York debut of the Lithuanian-born director Kama Ginkas. Audience members, who are conscripted into the roles of Katerina's guests, must listen patiently to her long tale of woe. But since most of the monologue is delivered in Russian, only those conversant with the language will grasp the nuances of her plight. Ms. Mysina gives a boldly physical, emotionally transparent performance, but there is no development of her character. And while it may seem paradoxical, involving an audience in a theatrical performance tends to lessen its impact. The self-consciousness that results shuts the lid on imaginative empathy (1:30). Freight Entrance Theater, 208 West 37th Street, Manhattan. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $40. Sold out for the run of the show.

*++ 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.
ISHERWOOD

* 'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.
BRANTLEY

+ 'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the cliched. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 p.m. Tickets: $55.
ISHERWOOD

+ 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.

Last Chance

*+ 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' Oh, spare a tear for dear old Gilbert and Sullivan! Too wordy to sit comfortably in the opera house, too quaint and old-fashioned for Broadway. Oh, bother not. They're doing just fine, thank you, as the prized property of devoted fans the world over. The New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players have been tending the legacy with loving care for three decades, and are in residence at City Center with an endearing production of ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' Alfred Bergeret, the artistic director of the company, has conscripted Hal Linden at the Major General. The rest of the cast is culled from regulars with the company. Equal measures of experience and affection are blended in their spirited, vocally confident performances (2:30) City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; final performance, Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85.

'THE RIVALS' Here she is at last! Dear old Mrs. Malaprop! The delightful Mrs. M, who, with a disdainful nod to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, misspoke her way to immortality in the pages of the Oxford English Dictionary. You know the word, you've probably made the mistake, and now, courtesy of the new Broadway revival of ''The Rivals,'' Sheridan's celebrated 1775 comedy of manners, you can finally make the acquaintance of the famous dame who generously bequeathed her name to a linguistic error. As personified by Dana Ivey, an actress of blissfully well-honed comic instincts, Mrs. Malaprop is indeed the main event in Mark Lamos's plumply upholstered production. But despite a largely zesty cast and a first-class production, the uncomfortable truth is Sheridan's comedy is one of those approved-and-certified classics that require unexpected reserves of patience and fortitude. Intermittently adorable, it is also, and not infrequently, tedious (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; final performance, Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $85.
ISHERWOOD

'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Snapshots from the past reveal layers of guilt, dissatisfaction and recrimination in the family history. Emotional entrapment, and the desperation it causes, have become obsessive themes in Mr. Allen's work, and they constitute almost the whole fabric of ''A Second Hand Memory.'' Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; final performance, Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

Now Playing

'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At 18 he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.
MANOHLA DARGIS

'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelganger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.
A. O. SCOTT

'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising instpirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, no relation to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown, as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.

'ELEKTRA' Starring Jennifer Garner, Terence Stamp, Kirsten Prout, Goran Visnjic, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 96 minutes). The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, ''Elektra'' stars Ms. Garner as a superheroine who dons fetishwear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. ''Your parents must have had a sense of humor,'' the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no they did not and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. What she emphatically does have -- and this of course is the entire point of ''Elektra'' -- is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the Victoria's Secret catalog.

'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on-screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.
DARGIS

* 'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered to the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed by ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a 100-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.
HOLDEN

'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.
DARGIS

'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (a k a Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.
DARGIS

'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations.
SCOTT

'A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG' Starring John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Shainee Gabel (R, 119 minutes). In this first feature directed by Ms. Gabel, Mr. Travolta delivers a hammed-up scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in ''Primary Colors.'' This is the story of a down-at-the-heels former star professor and his protege rotting in the New Orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folk-blues singer and their partial redemption when the singer's alienated daughter comes to live with them. The film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise. The movie's hokey solemnity suggests ''The Mundane Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood'' or ''The Notebook Goes to the Big Easy.'' The movie is another example of Hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes South.
HOLDEN

'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).
DARGIS

* 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.
SCOTT

* 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliche, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.
SCOTT

* 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan, and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.
DARGIS

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micromanaging phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.
SCOTT

'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles, all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.
SCOTT

'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trench mate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiance will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken.
DARGIS

'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose resume hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror and, as in numerous Japanese and Korean titles, his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.
DARGIS

'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Mos Def, Benjamin Bratt, David Alan Grier and Eve. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.

Pop

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

GREGG ALLMAN AND FRIENDS, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. Moonlighting from the Allman Brothers Band, the weary-voiced singer behind the beefy, soul-tinged keyboard parts leads his own band. It should jam the old songs in less familiar directions. Sunday at 7, with Jeffrey Gaines opening; tickets are $20.
JON PARELES

* SEKOUBA BAMBINO, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Both of Sekouba Bambino's parents were griots in Guinea -- his last name is Diabate, a familiar name for griots -- and despite their better wishes he followed them into music. With a voice that puts a husky penumbra around the soaring arabesques of griot style, in the 1970's he became the lead singer of Bembeya Jazz, one of the many African bands drawn to Cuban music. On his solo albums he finds his own ways to merge griot traditions, pop and a Latin lilt. He also sang with the Afro-Latin fusion group Africando. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 Sunday.
PARELES

BARBEZ, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Barbez, a New York City band, pushes sultry cabaret vocals and the violin and accordion of tango toward skewed extremes. Its repertory includes songs by Kurt Weill and the Residents. Tonight at 8, sharing the bill with Beat Circus; admission is $10.
PARELES

* DERRICK CARTER, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780. Mr. Carter, who has long been one of the country's leading house DJ's, loves to enliven his thwacking beats with all sorts of squiggles and squelches. On ''Live at Om'' (Om), a great double-CD that also includes a set by Mark Farina, Mr. Carter gravitates toward robotic basslines, disembodied voices and scrambled snippets of disco and jazz. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $30, midnight to 2 a.m., $25, after 2 a.m., $30.
KELEFA SANNEH

* GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500 and B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. George Clinton leads his large, motley band through marathon jams that preach togetherness without uniformity and subversion through pleasure. His funk vamps are constantly mutating, touching on gospel and be-bop, salsa and soul, hip-hop and heavy metal; they're omnivorous and utterly unpredictable, although the flux will doubtless include hits like ''Atomic Dog,'' ''Flash Light'' and ''Give Up the Funk.'' At Starland Ballroom tonight at 8; tickets are $25. At B.B. King tomorrow night at 8, where he shares the bill with a P-Funk alumnus: the keyboardist Bernie Worrell and the Woo Warriors. Tickets are $37.50 in advance, $42 tomorrow.
PARELES

* DR. DOG, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. This emerging Philadelphia band, enamored of light-headed riff-rock and off-kilter ballads, comes to New York to play for its small (but growing) cult of fans. Last year, the group released a charming album called, ''Easy Beat,'' which it plans to reissue this year, through National Parking Records. The album includes nine songs filled with breezy vocal harmonies and unexpected digressions, but the group's live show is much louder and more exuberant, especially when Scott McMicken unleashes one of his wailing, shape-shifting guitar solos. Tomorrow night at 9 (get there early -- Dr. Dog is the opening act), with the Upwelling, Hopewell and the King of France; tickets are $8.
SANNEH

JORDAN KNIGHT, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. A teen generation before 'N Sync squealed for the New Kids on the Block, who included Jordan Knight. He made a solo album in 1999, doing his best to apply his creamy tenor to the latest brittle beats, and he's working on a followup due this year. Tonight at 8, with Honestly opening and guest appearances by Rob Base, Flavor-Flav, Jon Knight and Tommy Page. Tickets are $20.
PARELES

* MATES OF STATE AND REGINA SPEKTOR, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Mates of State is the duo of Kori Gardner and her husband, Jason Hammel. Their new mini-album, ''All Day'' (Polyvinyl), has three playful, infectious new songs (plus a cover of David Bowie's ''Starman'') that are quietly radical in their commitment to equality: her keyboards are as loud as his drums; his words are as important as her ''Da, da, das.'' Ms. Spektor is an inventive singer-songwriter who keeps time on a piano while unleashing knotty, witty rants and songs; last year she released a striking debut album, ''Soviet Kitsch'' (Sire/Warner). Tonight at 10, with Ida; tickets are $14.
SANNEH

* MURK, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. Murk is the Miami-based duo of Oscar G. and Ralph Falcon, who excel at producing and spinning thick, hazy dance tracks that ooze and evolve, occasionally making way for snippets of euphoric vocals. They've done some of their best work on remixes, and earlier this year they turned Yoko Ono's ''Everyman Has a Woman Who Loves Him'' into a woozy, frenetic rhythm experiment, with Ms. Ono's vocals mainly submerged beneath synthesizer snarls and air-raid sirens. Tonight after 10; tickets are $15 in advance, expect to pay more at the door.
SANNEH

HUGH POOL BAND, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 683-6500. Hugh Pool's songs hark back to 1960's rock that was steeped in the blues. His repertory extends from rolling-and-tumbling slide-guitar boogies to neo-psychedelic jams to reflective, down-home hymns that recall the Band. Tonight's first set starts at 10 p.m.; free.
PARELES

* IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION, Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, below Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077. Wiry garage-rock adds a storyteller's intelligence in Ike Reilly's songs, which crank up the guitar riffs before they philosophize. Tonight at 10, with Speedway at 11 and Gene Dreamy and Gary Sincere at 9; admission is $8.
PARELES

THE SMITHEREENS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The ebullient guitars of 1960's rock and folk-rock and 1970's power pop echo in the songs of the Smithereens, which often harness bouyant melodies to sing about disappointments and regret. Tomorrow night at 7:30, with the Good Rats opening; tickets are $25.
PARELES

THE SCENE IS NOW, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The Scene Is Now is in its 30th year of turning stray musical ideas into pop songs that sound jerry-built but definitely are not. Sunday night at 8, with the Wrist & Pistols and Matt Mottel opening; admission is $8.

THE TOASTERS/THE PIETASTERS, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Ska got started in Jamaica in the 1960's and was revived in punk-era England in the 1970's; then punk-ska was revived in the United States in the 1980's and 1990's. And some bands are still at it: enough to fill all three floors for a night at the Knitting Factory. Along with the Toasters (formed in 1982) and the Pietasters, this night of uptempo bounce includes the Planet Smashers, the Supervillains, Westbound Train, the Players, Taj Motel Trio, Hub City Stompers, Superspecs, the Drastics, the Scorchers and Tristate Conspiracy. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow.

* BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. The imperious, Dieterich-like cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise an German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.
HOLDEN

* 'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra'' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging, 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $40.
HOLDEN

* WESLA WHITFIELD, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. This San Francisco pop-jazz singer has undergone a personal revolution. A once complacent performer, she now reads a song like a personal short story, her interpretations informed by a keen critical intelligence that views songs as tough-minded dialogues between cynicism and romantic faith. Her new show, ''In My Life'' (inspired by the Beatles song) expresses her complicated feelings about the New Year, which she declares ''has little to recommend it.'' Her solution to her dread is to dream. And the show balances a biting medley of vintage songs about money with soaring renditions of ''Some Other Time,'' ''I Have Dreamed,'' ''Pure Imagination'' and a witchy, seductive ''Bali Ha'i.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50 tonight and tomorrow night, $35 on Sunday; no minimum.

BEN RATLIFF

RICHARD BONA, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Richard Bona, a New Yorker born in Cameroon, is a fretless bass virtuoso who has performed with Joe Zawinul, Joni Mitchell and Harry Belafonte. While he knows his way around jazz-funk fusion, he is also a singer with the kind of gentle, imploring tenor prized in West Africa. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, $20 on Sunday.
RATLIFF

GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. The tenor saxophonist George Coleman, who is nearing 70, may be an athlete among musicians, but he doesn't go for extremes. He has always been a moderate, with fairly sophisticated harmonic knowledge and a strong blues sensibility, best known for his early work with Miles Davis -- an engagement that lasted for a little more than a year and produced several albums. If his legacy seems elusive compared with the countless musicians who were influenced by his top contemporaries -- Coltrane, Wayne Shorter or Sonny Rollins -- it has still endured, carried by those of similarly modest temperament. Tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11, and 12:30; cover charge is $20.
RATLIFF

* MARTY EHRLICH SOLO AND DUO WITH GREG COHEN, The Issue Room, 619 East 6th Street, East Village, (718) 812-1129. A veteran of the jazz scene in New York for more than 25 years who has traveled in almost every school of playing, Mr. Ehrlich is a saxophonist and clarinetist who can make you understand that jazz, in all its fragments, has an inner cohesion. Here he will play solo performances, something he hasn't done much lately, and duos with the bassist Greg Cohen. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $10.
RATLIFF

LOUIS HAYES BAND, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Louis Hayes, whose drumming you might know from the Blue Note hard-bop records of the mid-1960's, is a standard-bearer for this music, an almost classical entity. (He played with Horace Silver and Lee Morgan, among others.) Tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20, with a $10 minimum.

BILL HENDERSON AND RENE MARIE, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. Mr. Henderson, a bluesy ballad singer who has long lived in Los Angeles, and Rene Marie, a young New Yorker, represent slices of jazz singing's past and future. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30; limited tickets, $100 to $150.
RATLIFF

* HANK JONES TRIO AND KENNY WERNER TRIO, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Hank Jones, who made his first album in 1947, can improvise with such a minimum of fuss that it's not immediately obvious how many idioms he shuttles among: you hear 30's swing, bebop, drawling blues, a little repeated riff, some refracted harmony. Throughout, there is swing rhythm, sure and steady, and a seemingly endless number of songlike phrases that could conceivably have come from any part of American popular music in the last 50 years. Kenny Werner, who started leading bands in the 1980's, is a pianist with a terrific ear for harmony and a sense of the big picture; he's also able to show you all the good things about free improvising with few of the longeurs. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge at the tables is $25, with a $5 minimum; at the bar, $15 and a one-drink minimum.
RATLIFF

DAVE LIEBMAN BIG BAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. While many others of his late-1960's generation have fallen off in ambition, the soprano saxophonist Dave Liebman has remained dogged about composition and trying different styles, from Brazilian music to rearrangements of late-period Coltrane. He recently recorded a big-band album, ''Beyond the Line'' (Omnitone), with a 19-piece group. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.
RATLIFF

* BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. With excellent rhythm sections, a preference for tough, athletic group improvisation and a hyper-alert playing style, the saxophonist Branford Marsalis can pull off some of the more satisfying performances among current jazz musicians. His recent album, ''Eternal'' (Marsalis Music) is something new for him: an album of ballads. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, with a $10 minimum.
RATLIFF

PAT MARTINO TRIO, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. Pat Martino, who came out of Philadelphia in the 1960's, is one of jazz's finest guitarists, with a limpid sound and fast fingers; you'll see guitar students hanging on his every note. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 tonight and Sunday night, $32.50 tomorrow, with a $10 minimum all nights.
RATLIFF

* MULGREW MILLER TRIO WITH GARY BARTZ, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. The much-admired but seldom celebrated pianist Mulgrew Miller proves the efficacy of moderation. His playing commits no extravagance. At an even volume, he balances his improvisations among all the instrument's registers; he also balances bulletlike runs, sweet-and-sour experiments in harmony and rhythmic block-chording, producing just enough sound to ring through the band's. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.
RATLIFF

YOSVANY TERRY GROUP, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Yosvany Terry, the Cuban saxophonist, has has helped to redefine Latin jazz as a complex new idiom since arriving in New York; his band this weekend includes the trumpeter Avishai E. Cohen, the pianist Luis Perdomo, the drummer Dafnis Prieto and Mr. Terry's brother, the bassist Yunior Terry. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.
RATLIFF

VISION CLUB, L.E.S. Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street at Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681.

This weekend's participants are the trumpeter Matt Lavelle, with his band Espiritu; and the saxophonist Jemeel Moondoc's trio. Sets are tomorrow at 7:30 and 9; admission is $10 per set or $15 for the whole evening.
RATLIFF

THE WOLLESONS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934. A funk-jazz group led by the drummer Kenny Wolleson, who has played all over the map of New York jazz. Tomorrow night at 10 p.m.; no cover or minimum.

Opera

'CLAUDIA LEGARE' The composer Robert Ward won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1962 for his operatic adaptation of Arthur Miller's play ''The Crucible,'' a dramatically effective work though with a musically traditional score. The Dicapo Opera is offering New Yorkers a chance to hear a later work by Mr. Ward, the New York premiere of a chamber opera, ''Claudia Legare,'' adapted from Ibsen's ''Hedda Gabler'' and set in South Carolina after the Civil War. Mr. Ward's score is unabashedly conservative. For comparison, consider that when this opera had its 1978 premiere, Messiaen was composing his visionary ''Saint Francois d'Assise'' and Stephen Sondheim was hard at work on the groundbreaking ''Sweeney Todd.'' But ''Claudia Legare'' has its adherents, including Michael Capasso, the dedicated general director of the Dicapo Opera. The company has gone all out for this production, which runs through this Sunday. A very gratified Mr. Ward, 87, attended last weekend's performances. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, at St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438. Tickets: $47.50.

Classical Music

AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA As part of its ''Orchestra Underground'' series at Zankel Hall, this new-music orchestra is offering four world premieres, two of them commissioned for the occasion. The works are Jason Freeman's ''Glimmer,'' Carlos Carrillo's ''Algunas Metaforas que Aluden al Tormento, a la Angustia y a la Guerra,'' Dan Trueman's ''Traps Relaxed'' and Eve Beglarian's ''FlamingO,'' in a revised version. The Beglarian work sounds particularly promising: the composer describes it as ''not really an orchestra orchestra piece, but a piece for three simultaneous bands, which include flamingo honks, wolf chasers and other entertaining sounds.'' Steven Sloane, the orchestra's music director, will conduct, and So Percussion will perform with the orchestra, as will Mr. Trueman, who will play violin and electronics in his own work. Tonight at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $32.
ALLAN KOZINN

BARGEMUSIC As a composer dedicated to music education, Paul Hindemith made a project of writing sonatas for virtually every major instrument -- bassoon, tuba, you name it. Tonight at Bargemusic, the floating recital hall docked at Fulton Ferry Landing in Brooklyn (an ideal place for chamber music), you can hear Hindemith's Sonata for flute and piano played by the excellent flutist Michael Parloff and the nimble pianist Steven Beck, as well as Hindemith's Third Piano Sonata, which Mr. Beck will have to himself. Bach, another composer with an interest in music education, fills out the program, with two sonatas for flute and piano and the partita for solo flute. And that's not all at Bargemusic this weekend. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon brings a program of three piano trios by Beethoven, performed by the violinist Paul Rosenthal, the cellist Yehuda Hanani and the pianist Doris Stevenson. Flute and piano program: tonight at 7:30; Beethoven trios program: tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35, seniors $30, students $25.
TOMMASINI

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Aaron Jay Kernis keeps proving that a young American composer can engage the steady interest of performers and audiences. Lorin Maazel conducts the New York Philharmonic in Mr. Kernis's ''Lament and Prayer'' tonight, with the orchestra's concertmaster Glenn Dicterow taking the solo violin part. Mr. Kernis's piece, which had its premiere in 1996, remembers the 50th anniversary of the Holocaust. The piece will be surrounded on the program by Faure's ''Pelleas et Melisande'' Suite and the Sibelius First Symphony. Today at 11.a.m. and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $22 to $74 today and $25 to $90 tomorrow.
BERNARD HOLLAND

* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC ENSEMBLES The musicians of the New York Philharmonic periodically leave Avery Fisher Hall for Sunday afternoon chamber music concerts elsewhere in town. This week, the orchestra's string and wind players are offering a program that includes works by two of the players. Joseph Pereira, the orchestra's assistant principal timpanist, is presenting the world premiere of his Woodwind Quintet, and Vladimir Tsypin, a violinist, will perform his ''Three Songs for Bass and Violin.'' Also on the program are Mendelssohn's String Quintet in A and Brahms's irresistible String Sextet in B flat. Sunday at 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330. Tickets: $28.
KOZINN

* ADAM NEIMAN In 1996, this pianist gave a stunning debut recital that included a stunningly dramatic, colorful account of Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue (BWV 903), a work he will revisit at Town Hall on Sunday afternoon. At the time Mr. Neiman was only 17, but was already a polished, resourceful and imaginative performer. It should be interesting to hear how he plays at the comparatively grand old age of 25. His program, part of the People's Symphony series, also includes Schubert's Sonata in A minor (Op. 143), Prokofiev's Sonata in D minor (Op. 14, No. 2) and a handful of Chopin works, among them the Grand Waltz in A flat (Op. 42), the Waltz in C-sharp minor (Op. 64, No. 2), the Mazurka in A minor (Op. 17, No. 4) and the Ballade in F minor (Op. 52). Sunday at 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680. Tickets: $9 and $11.
KOZINN

CHITOSE OKASHIRO This fine young pianist kicks off the Miller's Theater's festival ''Brahms the Progressive'' (a counter to Lincoln Center's ''Brahms the Classical Romantic'' last fall?). She plays late piano works of Brahms (Opp. 118, 119), followed by presumably kindred music of Takemitsu, Messiaen and Ichizo Okashiro, her brother. Later programs will feature similar juxtapositions of Brahms with modern composers in horn trios, piano quartets, piano quintets and string sextets. Tonight at 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $25.
JAMES R. OESTREICH

OSLO STRING QUARTET This Norwegian foursome performs its New York recital debut with an intriguing program that includes selections from both its national and regional repertory: the United States premiere of a work by the prominent Norwegian composer Lasse Thoresen and the String Quartet No. 5 by the Swedish composer Wilhelm Stenhammar. Rounding out the program with a work from the ''international'' literature, the group will play one of Beethoven's ''Razumovsky'' Quartets (Op. 59, No. 2). Sunday at 2 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20, students and seniors $10.
JEREMY EICHLER

JEAN-CLAUDE PENNETIER This well-regarded French pianist is currently at work recording the complete Beethoven sonatas, but for this New York recital debut in the warm and rounded music room of the Frick Collection, he has assembled an enticing all-French program: Ravel's Sonatine, Faure's Preludes and Debussy's Preludes, Book I. Sunday at 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. Free, though tickets are required.
EICHLER

RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY The adventurous and admirable Riverside Symphony offers a typically intriguing program tomorrow night, for which the conductor George Rothman is joined by the soprano Ann Panagulias and the male vocal quartet Hudson Shad. An orchestral work, Copland's early, jazz-inspired ''Music for the Theater,'' will be complimented by an actual work of musical theater, ''The Seven Deadly Sins,'' with music by Kurt Weill and texts by Bertolt Brecht. The program also offers the New York premiere of Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon's ''Candelabra III,'' which the orchestra's directors describe as a riveting and deeply personal score. Tomorrow night at 8, Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $45.
TOMMASINI

TAKACS QUARTET Decca Records has just released the final installment of this half-Hungarian, half-English ensemble's Beethoven quartet cycle, and to celebrate, the group is performing the complete series under the auspices of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Its format is mix-and-match: most of the programs offer an early, middle and late quartet (although tonight's includes two early works and nothing from the middle period). A chronological rendering of these works may make more sense for listeners intent on following Beethoven's journey, but for those who aren't taking in the full series, the Takacs's approach has the virtue of showing Beethoven's development in microcosm within each program. The program tonight includes the Quartets in C minor (Op. 18, No. 4), A (Op. 18, No. 5) and A minor (Op. 132). Sunday, the ensemble offers the Quartets in D (Op. 18, No. 3), E minor (Op. 59, No. 2) and E flat (Op. 127). Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $30 to $42, tonight; Sunday is sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office.
KOZINN

VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE New York concert-goers have gotten to know of George Steel as an agitator for contemporary music of all kinds through the bracing and popular programs he presents at Miller Theater. But Mr. Steel is also a fine choral conductor whose other passion is Renaissance and Baroque choral music. On Saturday night the Vox Vocal Ensemble, which Mr. Steel founded, performs a program to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the English Renaissance master Thomas Tallis. And the Rotunda of the Low Library has ideally reverberant acoustics for Tallis's mystical choral music. Tomorrow night at 8, Low Library Rotunda, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $35.

JACK ANDERSON

* CLASSICAL SAVION Savion Glover has returned. Need we say more? But this is the last weekend to see him -- if there are any tickets left in Fort Knox -- in a program in which he performs almost entirely to classical music. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org. Tickets: $42.
JENNIFER DUNNING

* DANCE ON CAMERA FESTIVAL Produced by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Dance Films Association, the festival will present six different programs in this last of three weekends. Highlights include one of the great video-dance classics, ''Dune Dance,'' from 1978, by Carolyn Brown and James Klosty, in which all ordinary senses of time are altered by the paces of a dancer and the slow surge and retreat of water on the sand. The performers include Sara Rudner and other dancers from the companies of Twyla Tharp and Merce Cunningham (tomorrow at 3:30 p.m.). Other new programs are ''Dancing From the Heart,'' an exploration by Marilyn Hunt of the importance of dance in the Pueblo Indian culture (today at 3:30 p.m.) and ''Tango: A Strange Turn,'' a history of that dance and music form (tonight at 9). Other programs are ''The Gods of Bali'' (today at 1 p.m.); ''The Red Shoes'' (tonight at 6:15), and new dance films from France (tomorrow at 1 p.m.). In connection with the festival, an exhibition of paintings, designs and photographs by Geoffrey Holder will run through January. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center Plaza, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600 or www.filmlinc.com. Tickets: $10; $7 for students, $5 for 65+ for weekday matinees.

ALONZO KING LINES BALLET Alonzo King's work has been seen often recently in New York, performed by the Alvin Ailey company, but this is a rare performance here by his own San Francisco-based troupe. The program includes the New York premiere of ''Before the Blues,'' set to music by Pharoah Sanders, and the intriguingly entitled ''Who Dressed You Like a Foreigner?,'' to music by Zakir Hussain. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place at Washington Square South, Manhattan, (212) 992-8484. Tickets: $20 to $40.
DUNNING

YVONNE MEIER Ms. Meier conjures up mysterious creatures in ''Limpopo, Part II,'' a revision of a 1987 work that uses Expressionist imagery to evoke longing, rage and madness in ''Mad Heidi.'' Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.
ANDERSON

* EARL MOSLEY'S DIVERSITY OF DANCE Earl Mosley's modern-dance choreography and his committed dancers tend to get the heart beating harder, and this program looks no different, with pieces set to music by composers and performers including Nina Simone, Cyndi Lauper, YoYo Ma, Roberta Flack and Sade. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $18; $12 students and 65+.
DUNNING

* NEW YORK CITY BALLET This is Christopher Wheeldon Weekend at City Ballet, what with a performance of Mr. Wheeldon's thought-provoking ''Polyphonia'' tonight, with an all-star cast dancing to music by Ligeti, and the premiere tomorrow night of ''After the Rain.'' George Balanchine and Peter Martins also manage to get their choreographic say, with an all-Balanchine program tomorrow afternoon. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or www.nycballet.com. Tickets: $30-83. For availability of Student Rush tickets at $12, check the company Web site or call (212) 870-7766. The company will also present a ''Ballet Insight'' program, in which company insiders talk about aspects of the ballet, tonight from 6:45 to 7:30 at the City Ballet studios at the Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center. Tickets: $8. And Jerome Robbins is the subject of a company seminar featuring the dance writer and Robbins biographer Deborah Jowitt on Monday from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at the State Theater. Tickets: $5. Information on both programs: (212) 870-4074.

* PHILADANCO This august yet vibrant Philadelphia-based company will pay tribute to African-American dance with new and repertory pieces by Christopher Huggins, Bebe Miller and Ronald K. Brown, set to music by Steve Reich, La Voix Bulgare and Led Zeppelin, and Wunmi Olaiya. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, one block from the junction of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Brooklyn, (718) 951-4500. Tickets: $30.
DUNNING

ROSEANNE SPRADLIN ''Future Past'' choreographically reflects on themes of mortality, time and memory with the aid of a commissioned score by John Bischoff that combines electronic music with natural sounds and the ringing of bells.

Art

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.
HOLLAND COTTER

'BLUE,' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through March 6. This cool, offbeat little show is made up of all-blue or mostly blue objects from the permanent collection, including, ceramics, quilts, Shaker ''gift drawings'' and some attractive portraits. In one dated around 1768, a proud young Newport, R.I., belle wears pricey pale blue silk. An 1830 watercolor of a boy named Frederick Buxton was done on the cheap. But while his blue suit has faded with time, his big, candid eyes are as blue as the day they were painted. They make a perfect conclusion to this chromatic take on American social history. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students, 62+, $7.
COTTER

JAMES GILLRAY, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089, through Jan. 29. One of the most popular cartoonists of his day, Gillray (1756-1815) produced lively, hand-colored etchings that lampooned major public figures like the king, the queen and Napoleon, and many minor ones, too. At his best, Gillray's draftsmanly skill and visionary imagination puts him in a league with artists like William Blake, James Ensor and R. Crumb. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.
KEN JOHNSON

'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.
JOHNSON

THE LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER, Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. Having made possible high-density open-storage displays at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New-York Historical Society, the Henry Luce Foundation has now done the Brooklyn Museum a similar favor. Brooklyn's new ''visible storage'' gallery assembles 1,500 objects from four departments and represents 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas, as well as several years of work by curators, designers and computer programmers. Sleek up-to-date vitrines house often jaw-dropping clusters of related objects: Tiffany lamps and glass; early Native American ceramics; pewter and silver, 19th and 20th-century design objects ranging from chairs to clocks and radios. Displays of Spanish Colonial art and the notebooks of the 19th-century landscapist William Trost Richards amount to mini-exhibitions. Nearly 600 paintings and scores of sculpture are also on view. Computer terminals enable visitors to call up detailed information about each object and to also learn about the inner-workings of the museum. In all, the new gallery represents a welcome departure from the Brooklyn's tendency to pit great works of art against needlessly intrusive installation designs. May its example prevail. Hours and admission: see above.
ROBERTA SMITH

* 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.
GRACE GLUECK

Galleries: Uptown

ROSWELL ANGIER, Gitterman, 170 East 75th Street, (212) 734-0868, through Jan. 29. In the early 1970's, this photographer explored a Boston netherworld called the Combat Zone where strip joints and other sex-related businesses flourished. His documentary pictures of strippers and pimps are not sensational but matter-of-fact, tender and sad. A more recent series studying street and bar life in Native American border towns in the Southwest is similarly humane and visually poetic.
JOHNSON

MILTON AVERY: 'ONRUSHING WAVES,' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 29. The sea was always a painterly challenge for Avery (1885-1965) who saw it as a landscape of forms in endless free motion. This show of his seascapes from the 1920's through the 50's includes paintings, watercolors and a selection of his sketchbooks recording trips to seaworthy places. The best of the canvases here are the later ones, larger and much closer to abstraction, done in Provincetown summers. ''Onrushing Wave,'' which gives the show its title, is a white field stroked with horizontal dashes of off-blue; in the foreground is a mountainous white crest that confronts the viewer head on, vertically striated with the same blue. At the painting's bottom, rows of tiny blue ripples giver whispering echo to the upheaval above them. These works stay fresh no matter how often you've seen them.
GLUECK

ANTHONY CARO: 'PAINTED SCULPTURE,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, (212) 744-7400, through Feb. 26. In the 1960's, Mr. Caro diverted into the field of formalist, welded steel sculpture some of the hedonism, playfulness and freedom that were rejuvenating broader sectors of European and American culture. Six works from the 60's and early 70's presented by this show still look infectiously fresh, while three recent assemblages of industrial metal parts exude a comparatively ponderous gravitas.

JOEL SHAPIRO, Cook Fine Art, 1063 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street, (212) 737-3550, through Feb. 25. This is a fine, economical retrospective of the post-Minimalist sculptor's career. There are not any of the early diminutive houses but there is a small, toylike bronze horse from 1973-4 that may surprise viewers familiar with Mr. Shapiro's oeuvre. Also on hand are dense, blocky abstract sculptures in painted wood and in bronze and elegant, sumptuous geometric drawings on paper in velvety charcoal and vividly colored pastels.

Galleries: 57th Street

JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Feb. 5. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.

Galleries: SoHo

* 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown.

Galleries: Chelsea

THOMAS ASHCRAFT, CUE, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, through Jan. 29. Mr. Ashcraft's spooky installation in a darkened room is like the workshop of an industrious, 19th-century scholar-mystic that has been carefully preserved as a museum attraction. Two subjects in particular emerge: a presumably fictive place called Heliotown, or the ''Interdimensional City of Friends,'' where the artist is said to live as ''extrapolator in residence''; and the idea of money as the materialized form of energies needed for other-dimensional travel.
JOHNSON

CHARLOTTE BECKET, Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 924-0212, through Feb. 5. Ms. Becket's ''Wishing Well'' is a notable contribution to the department of extreme trash accumulation, kinetic division. Stacked tiers of paper, cardboard, bottles and other sorts of refuse sandwiched between sheets of plywood rise 10 feet in the air. In the middle of this tower of garbage, a vertical conveyor continuously churns up loose debris. It owes a lot to the work of Phoebe Washburn but has its own wacky humor and inventiveness.
JOHNSON

FABIAN BIRGFELD, Josee Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-7990. Through January 29. As the exhibition's press release accurately observes, Mr. Birgfeld's work is 'a reflection on the culture of mobility.' It is visually engaging, too. Small triptychs of photographs depicting airports, train stations and subway passageways are formally elegant; and video sculptures in which elevator doors open and close within vertical wooden structures have an oddly soothing effect. (Johnson)

ROZ CHAST: 'SEASON'S GREETINGS,' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410. through Jan. 29. For her first New York gallery exhibition, this brilliant cartoonist presents recent cartoons, many of which have appeared in The New Yorker, and a set of eggs brightly painted according to a traditional Ukrainian craft. The eggs bearing images of funny-looking people are amusing, but they don't compete with the cartoons' hilarious and uncannily acute take on the conflicted psychic life of ordinary, white, liberal Americans.
JOHNSON

'CONSTRUCTED IMAGE,' Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, through Jan. 29. Though not quite convincing as a theme show, this 15-artist exhibition presents some compelling works, including a small, extraordinarily life-like bronze head with glass eyes by Elizabeth King; a haunting Pop-surrealist painting of an old boxer by Llyn Foulkes; a large collage portrait of a woman made of neatly inlaid pieces of road maps by Matthew Cusick and a bizarrely erudite, diagrammatic painting about the Grand Guignol Theater by Paul Laffoley.
JOHNSON

'THE FURNITURE OF POUL KJAERHOLM AND SELECTED ART WORK,' Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181; R 20th Century, 82 Franklin Street, (212) 343-7979, through Jan. 29. The market-accelerated convergence of art and design proceeds apace with this two-gallery exhibition of severely elegant, Modernist furniture by the Danish designer Poul Kjaerholm (1929-1980) with works by 19 contemporary artists from John Baldessari to Richard Tuttle providing background aesthetic resonance. Many of Kjaerholm's works look like anonymous airport furnishings, but the best have a finely detailed grace.
JOHNSON

EMILE GUEBEHI AND MALICK SIDIBE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701, through Feb. 5. Lively studio portraits from 40 years and curious new photographs of heavy women seen from behind by Mr. Sidibe, the celebrated photographer from Mali, nicely complement the striking painted sculptures by the Ivory Coast-based Mr. Guebehi. Representing big, buxom women naked or partly naked and, in some cases, visibly pregnant, the sculptures look like the works of a self-taught artist with a thing for maternal women.
JOHNSON

KEITH HARING, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, (212) 560-0670, through Jan. 29. If you liked the New Museum's lively survey of the East Village scene of the 1980's, you will appreciate this selection of paintings and sculptures by one of the best artists to emerge from that cauldron of antic creativity. It includes subway drawings in chalk on black paper; large, dizzyingly patterned canvases and brightly enameled, cut-metal characters. Barking dogs, radiant babies, flying saucers, mythic monsters and all kinds of hyperactive humans animate Haring's delirious cosmic comedy.
JOHNSON

'ONE-ARMED BANDIT,' D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Feb. 12. This three-artist show is notable mainly for its playful installation. Presented in groups of three with each artwork framed by red tape applied to the wall, Polly Apfelbaum's gridded drawings of cartoon blossoms on white velvet, Tony Feher's flattened, glitter-covered found boxes and Joanne Greenbaum's buoyant abstract pictures are displayed in various permutations like slot machine icons.
JOHNSON

'ED RUSCHA, ROBERT FRANK, WALKER EVANS,' Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-9610, through Jan. 29. A fine synergy is generated by this selection of pictures by photographers from three distinct generations. All share an understated, sometimes ironic, sometimes mordantly romantic love for vernacular American culture of the street and the open road. The show includes late Polaroid shots of commercial and traffic signs by Evans; examples from Mr. Frank's beatnik-era masterpiece ''The Americans'' and aerial views of parking lots by Mr. Ruscha.
JOHNSON

THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Feb. 5. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.
JOHNSON

Other Galleries

'FIGHT OR FLIGHT,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Feb. 18. Six artists were asked to make works about fear and anxiety. Excepting Rico Gatson's kaleidoscopic video punctuated by exploding bombs, none directly address war or terrorism. Amy Gartrell's psychedelic felt banners spoof self-affirmation mantras, Kristin Baker's semiabstract paintings evoke car crashes and Marc Swanson's ship mast with a square sail of stitched-together T-shirts encourages a spirit of adventure. Little carnivorous horses graze on the flesh of a fallen dragon in Ivan Witenstein's large fantasy sculpture and an installation by Wangechi Mutu stages a surrealistic shootout.
JOHNSON

'NYC,' DFN Gallery, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 334-3400, through Jan. 29. This selection of New York City-scapes by more than 40 painters is uneven but has many good things, including: a picture of the Columbia University green from 1975 by Rackstraw Downes; a small, Whistleresque study of office building windows by Alex Katz; a dreamy vision of a Coney Island roller coaster by David Levine; and a finely detailed, overhead picture of an intersection painted in egg tempera by Douglas Safranek with the tender exactitude of an early Renaissance master.
JOHNSON

PINAR YOLACAN: 'PERISHABLES,' Rivington Arms, 102 Rivington Street, between Essex and Ludlow Streets, (646) 654-3213, through Feb. 6. Ms. Yolacan's provocatively discomfiting large photographs portray elderly women in carefully tailored off-white blouses, sweaters or scarves made wholly or partly of raw animal flesh -- tripe and chicken skin, mainly -- purchased from butchers. You can read her pictures as unusually visceral feminist poems about fashion and mortality.
JOHNSON

Last Chance

FRANZ ACKERMANN, 'NONSTOP WITH HHC,' Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, closing tomorrow. This Berlin-based painter who was shortlisted for the 2004 Hugo Boss Prize, has produced a characteristically enveloping, high-energy environment of mural painting and variously sized canvases and works on paper centered around a giant, free-standing, Pop-Cubist style painting apparently representing a crashed airplane. Altogether it makes for a lively but grandiose commentary on the thrills and terrors of globalized modernity.
JOHNSON

* A. BALASUBRAMANIAM, Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, closing tomorrow. The work of this exceptional young artist, based in India, is about the play of material solidity and illusion. His first show at Talwar two years ago included a full-size human form that seemed to pass through a gallery wall; for the current show he has cast his own head in an opaque, waxy substance of a kind used to produce air fresheners, so that the self-portrait will dissolve through slow evaporation. Time and change are also the subjects of other work here. And the whole, spare, resonant show comes together in a sculpture of a single slender branch bristling with sharp thorns and cast in solid gold; the more alluring illusion is, the more be painful it can be.
COTTER

* 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D.,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closing on Sunday. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. Most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. Hours and admission: see above.
COTTER

'IN THIS PLACE,' Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-0473, closing tomorrow. This exhibition of photographs and videos by 15 artists includes works that evoke specific places, like Claudio Nolasco's street-level views of Williamsburg and Francesca Romeo's powerful video record of life in a Lower East Side bar. But too many others look as if they could have been made just about anywhere -- Clifford Owens's sadomasochistic video performance piece set in an empty studio, for example -- and that undermines the thesis of the show's curator, Allen Frame.
JOHNSON

'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' the Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, closing today. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Solorzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape painted in orange and white on the wall; and Rem Koolhaas's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by Jose Davila.
JOHNSON

FRATELLI TOSO, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 691-6565, closing tomorrow. Fratelli Toso was a Murano glass-making factory in Venice that operated from 1823 to 1979. This beautiful show presents bottles, vases and bowls made in the murrine technique in which round slices of multi-colored glass canes are melded together before the final shape is blown. The woozy, richly colorful and intensely detailed floral and starburst patterns are riveting to look at and each object is a marvel of luxurious sensuousness. Visual hedonists take note.
JOHNSON

SU-MEI TSE, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, closing tomorrow. This exhibition features the work that won the prize for best national pavilion -- Luxembourg's -- at the 2003 Venice Bienale. It consists of a white neon sign that reads ''[E:r] conditionne,'' and two dreamlike video projections. In one, the artist plays the cello on a grassy, alpine prominence; in the other, men in green janitorial uniforms in a desert use green-bristled brooms to sweep sand into small piles.

BYLINE: By Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
New York State's unemployment rate rose slightly to 5.3 percent in December 2004, up from 4.9 percent in November, according to the federal government. It was the third consecutive month in which the state's unemployment rate was lower than the nation's, which remained at 5.4 percent. The job count in New York State's private sector increased by 4,400, or 0.1 percent in December, the same as the nation's rate of growth for the same period, the State Labor Department reported yesterday. Job growth was firmest in the educational and health services fields and in the leisure and hospitality industries, led by an increase in tourism in New York City. Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT)

WRISTON, WALTER B.

 BODY:
 WRISTON--Walter B. On January 19, 2005 in New York City after an 18 month fight with pancreatic cancer. He was 85. Mr. Wriston was one of the most innovative financiers of our time. Mr. Wriston was born in Middletown, CT, and graduated from Wesleyan University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Following a year's service as a U.S. State Department officer and a four-year tour with the U.S. Army during World War II, Mr. Wriston joined Citibank in 1946. He held numerous positions at Citibank and served as chairman and chief executive officer of Citicorp for 17 years before retiring in 1984 after 38 years with the company. Mr. Wriston was a visionary who saw the future of the banking industry and the important role it would play in the global economy. He is credited with jumpstarting the electronic banking revolution with the introduction of the ATM as well as the expansion of Citibank's international franchise. At the time of Mr. Wriston's retirement, Citibank had bcome the world's largest bank with branches in 79 countries and its investment in computers and software surpassing $1.75 billion. An outspoken advocate on the need for the deregulation of the banking industry and the free flow of capital, Mr. Wriston was also a powerful voice in Washington and was named chairman of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board in 1982. Widely quoted for his forward thinking remarks, his most famous quote, ''Information about money has become almost as important as money itself,'' is inscribed in the lobby of the New York Library of Science, Industry and Business. Mr. 
Wriston served as a director of several corporations including General Mills, General Electric, J.C. Penney, Pfizer and ICOS. In June 2004, Mr. Wriston received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award. He is also the author of two books, In the Twilight of Sovereignty and Risk and Other Four-Letter Words. He is survived by his wife, Kathryn; daughter, Catherine Quintal; son-in-law, Richard Quintal; two grandchildren, Christopher and Barbara Catherine; and his sister, Barbara Wriston. Burial services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date in February. In lieu of flowers, contributions should be made to The Lust Garten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer, 1111 Stewart Avenue, Bethpage, New York 11714.
WRISTON--Walter B. The Trustees, Life Trustees, Physicians and Staff of NewYorkPresbyterian Hospital and the Overseers, Faculty and Staff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend, Walter B. Wriston. A financier, philanthropist and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, Mr. Wriston championed the democratizing effects of globalization and information technology. A member of the Board of Trustees of the Hospital since 1975, he lent his uncommon vision, keen intellect and leadership skills to furthering our mission of excellence in patient care. We especially appreciate his early and prescient efforts to bring the benefits of information technology to the Hospital and Medical College as a member of the institutions' Joint Board. We also remember him as the co-founder of ''Cabaret!,'' NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center's annual fund-raising event. He leaves an outstanding legacy of stewardship and benevolence. We will miss his wisdom, kindness, and friendship, and join with all those who knew him in mourning his loss. Our deepest condolences are extended to his beloved wife, Kathryn, and to the entire Wriston family. John J. Mack, Chairman, Board of Trustees Dr. Herbert Pardes, President & CEO Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Vice Chairman Charlotte M. Ford, Vice Chairman Peter A. Georgescu, Vice Chairman Jerry I. Speyer, Vice Chairman NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Sanford I.

HEADLINE: MBNA Earnings Rise 9.3%; Company to Cut 1,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The MBNA Corporation, the world's largest independent charge card company, said yesterday that its quarterly earnings rose 9.3 percent. The company also said it would incur as much as $350 million in costs to shed about 1,000 jobs.
 Third-quarter net income increased to $768.9 million, or 59 cents a share, from $703.5 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Earnings topped the average estimate of 58 cents among analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. 
 MBNA, based in Wilmington, Del., is cutting jobs as growth in loans wanes, a result of the company's decision to back away from no-interest credit card promotions. Loans, which increased 3 percent, to $121.6 billion, as of Dec. 31, would have been $4 billion higher if MBNA had kept up the promotions, Kenneth A. Vecchione, MBNA's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
 Robert Millen, who helps manage $3.2 billion for Jensen Portfolio Inc., including 5.5 million MBNA shares, said of the job eliminations: ''It's been needed. They have a lot of competition and they need to reposition their company to have a cost structure for a slower-growth market.''
 MBNA estimated that the voluntary retirement program, which is aimed at eliminating about 3 percent of the work force, will save $150 million this year and $200 million in 2006. The pretax costs will come during the first quarter. MBNA also said it would buy back as much as $2 billion of its shares through 2006.
 ''Our hiring, our staffing got ahead of our loan growth,'' Mr. Vecchione said.
 MBNA now offers no-interest introductory rates in 10 percent of the 30 million to 40 million credit card promotions it mails out each month, Mr. Vecchione said. That is down from 40 percent in January a year ago.
 ''We have been shifting, offering the consumer a variety of different reward programs in addition to zero interest rates,'' he said. ''The money comes in a little slower but it's stickier and we get more loyalty from our customers.''
 MBNA's delinquency rate fell to 3.29 percent from 3.84 percent. That helped the company set aside less for loan losses, an amount counted as an expense that reduces profit. Credit loss provisions dropped 23 percent, to $257 million.
 MBNA shares rose 24 cents to close at $27.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.

PERSON: Saru Jayaraman

HEADLINE: For the Kitchen Help, She Stands the Heat

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
SARU JAYARAMAN has good reason to be pleased. She is the executive director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, a little nonprofit that just pulled off a David-versus-Goliath feat. The center extracted $164,000 from two fashionable Manhattan restaurants -- Cite and the Park Avenue Cafe -- to settle lawsuits that involved charges of discrimination and failure to pay overtime to 23 restaurant employees, most of whom are immigrants from Mexico and Bangladesh.
 The center was born out of the ashes of the World Trade Center to help the surviving employees of Windows on the World, and it has grown into a muscular advocacy group for restaurant workers citywide. 
 The other afternoon, Ms. Jayaraman, who is also a lawyer and an adjunct college professor, sits underneath what she calls the victory wall in the center's cramped TriBeCa office. Displayed on it are oversize checks. There is the fat one symbolizing the $164,000 from the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group, which owns Cite and the Park Avenue Cafe. There is also a $19,500 check to settle legal charges involving the Three Guys Restaurant, a diner in Manhattan where Mexican workers said they were told they were too fat, dark and ugly to be waiters.
 ''In our experience and through our research,'' Ms. Jayaraman says, ''you wouldn't believe the ads put out by restaurant employers -- 'good-looking required, send photos' -- to be a waiter. Employers have told us that means they want good-looking white people in the front and hard workers in the back. Hard workers mean immigrants.''
 The latest settlement is one of six campaigns waged by the center since it started in April 2002, shaming restaurants through litigation and demonstrations into paying a total of more than $300,000 in back wages and discrimination payments, in addition to improved working conditions. 
 Ms. Jayaraman often leads the protests outside the restaurants. She is a soprano who used to sing with a gospel choir at Harvard. ''It comes in very handy,'' she says.
 The restaurant workers came up with a Christmas-carol protest outside Cite in Midtown. ''You better pay up, I'm telling you why, R.O.C. New York is coming to town,'' she chimes in singsong.
 Wearing a tangerine turtleneck and jeans, she looks younger than her 29 years. She has a heart-shaped face and a high-pitched squeal of a laugh.
 One would think Ms. Jayaraman would be eager to talk. The center is on a roll. This fall, it plans to open a restaurant, Colors, on Lafayette Street near Astor Place, to be owned and governed by workers. On Tuesday, the center is set to release what it describes as a groundbreaking report on the state of the restaurant industry.
 Yet Ms. Jayaraman is uncomfortable, squirming, about being the interview subject. She explains she is merely the group's facilitator.
 ''As an organizer, I don't think that this is appropriate,'' she says somewhat sternly. ''The point is that restaurant workers lead their own struggles for justice. I'm just a spark in the fire.''
 She is insistent and tough. In her cluttered corner of the room, there are posters of Che Guevara, Mahatma Gandhi and Angela Davis. Ms. Jayaraman, who is single and works 70 to 80 hours a week, lives in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. 
 She does not want to be in the spotlight. But her career trajectory has been rather striking. A daughter of immigrants from southern India, a graduate of Yale Law School and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, she was singled out and honored as one of America's finest young people in 1995 by President Bill Clinton. 
 MR. CLINTON recognized her not only as a top undergraduate at the University of California, Los Angeles, but also because two years earlier, at 17, she founded Women and Youth Supporting Each Other in Los Angeles, where she was born. The group's goals are to teach women leadership skills and reduce high pregnancy rates. It is now a national organization with 12 chapters in six states.
 She says she created the group because she was angry at the way teachers constantly told her and her classmates that they would probably get pregnant and not make it through high school. As it turned out, some classmates fulfilled that prophecy. ''I wanted to find a way to provide something with more opportunity, more options and more self-esteem,'' she says.
 Ms. Jayaraman, whose father is an unemployed software developer and whose mother is a school aide, grew up in a Mexican-American neighborhood in southeast Los Angeles. Fluent in Spanish, she says her interest gravitated to immigrants as she began to understand the pressures and abusive working conditions faced by the families of the young women she came to know. She has organized Hispanic workers and day laborers on Long Island for a nonprofit group, the Workplace Project. She teaches political science at Brooklyn and Queens Colleges and immigrant rights at New York University.
 After the Sept. 11 terror attacks, she was invited by the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union to found the worker center. Despite charges from the restaurant industry that the group is a union in disguise, she insists that as rabble-rousing and litigious as the center may be, it is not a union.
 ''We are not interested in getting a collective bargaining agreement or servicing grievances that workers have in an ongoing way,'' she says, noting that fewer than 3 percent of the city's 165,000 restaurant workers are unionized. ''What we're trying to do is to get settlement agreements. We're trying to get justice for workers.''

HEADLINE: Disappointing Forecasts Send Shares Tumbling

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, sending benchmark indexes to new lows for the year, after eBay and Qualcomm said profit might miss analysts' estimates.
 AT&T's forecast of a bigger 2005 sales decline than analysts expected, along with Ford Motor's loss at its carmaking unit, added to concern that earnings would slow more than anticipated.
 ''There are quite a lot of companies that are reporting earnings that are a little light,'' said Douglas Ober, who manages the $1.3 billion Adams Express fund in Baltimore. ''People say, 'Oh, well, it looks like things are slowing down a bit.' In the short term, it's liable to cause some disappointment and some selling.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.22 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,175.41, its lowest since Nov. 30. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 68.50 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,471.47.
 The Nasdaq composite index fell 27.71 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,045.88, dragged lower by Amazon.com and Yahoo shares in the wake of eBay's results. The Nasdaq, which gets two-fifths of its value from computer-related shares, closed at a level not seen since Nov. 10.
 About three stocks dropped for every one that gained on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.6 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, in line with the three-month daily average.
 Stocks extended their losses after a regional survey showed manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded at its slowest pace since July 2003. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's index of current conditions fell to 13.2 from 25.4 in December.
 The S.&P. 500 is down 3 percent this year and is headed toward its worst January since 2000. 
 ''We've had some pretty high-profile companies miss Wall Street expectations -- like an eBay, like J.P. Morgan,'' said Edwin Miska, who manages about $1 billion for First Investors Management in New York. ''There seems to be a real caution out there in terms of investors committing.''
 EBay, the largest Internet auction site, plunged $19.72, or 19 percent, to $83.33. The company said profit excluding some costs would rise to as much as $1.52 a share for the full year, less than the $1.61 average estimate of analysts in a Thomson Financial survey. In the fourth quarter, eBay earned 33 cents, excluding certain costs, missing the average estimate by a penny. 
 Qualcomm, the No.2 maker of chips that run mobile phones, dropped $3.29 to $37.78, after saying fiscal second-quarter profit would be as much as 27 cents a share, less than the 30-cent average estimate of analysts in a Thomson survey.
 Ford slid 47 cents, to $13.46. Its automotive operations had a pretax loss of $470 million last quarter, and only the income from its lending unit enabled Ford to report a fourth-quarter profit of $104 million.
 AT&T lost 44 cents, to $18.07, after it forecast a drop in revenue of as much as 18 percent this year, to $25 billion to $26 billion. Analysts on average expected $26.5 billion, according to Thomson. 
 Citigroup, the world's biggest financial services company, lost 27 cents, to $47.77. Its chief financial officer, Sallie Krawcheck, said she was ''more comfortable'' with the lower end of analysts' 2005 earnings estimates, which range from $4.20 to $4.57 a share, according to Thomson Financial.
 Citigroup said fourth-quarter earnings rose 12 percent, to a record $5.32 billion, in part because the bank released some money it previously set aside to cover loan losses.
 Delta Air Lines fell 58 cents, to $5.37. The company said its fourth-quarter net loss widened to $16.58 a share from $2.69 a year ago.
 May Department Stores climbed $2.88, or 9.2 percent, to $34.25. The owner of the Lord & Taylor and Filene's chains rose after The Wall Street Journal reported that Federated Department Stores was holding talks to buy May.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 2/32, to a price of 100 22/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.16 percent from 4.17 percent on Wednesday.

PERSON: Walter B. Wriston

HEADLINE: Walter B. Wriston, Banking Innovator as Chairman of Citicorp, Is Dead at 85

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citicorp who became the most influential banker of his generation by making his bank into the world's largest through a barrage of innovations, including the automated teller machine, died on Wednesday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, his brother-in-law, Robert Dineen, said.
 When he started at what was then First National City Bank in 1946, Mr. Wriston sat at a roll-top desk waiting for customers and feared that he would be bored to death by the stodgy banking world. 
 By the time he retired in 1984, he had dazzled the industry through aggressive international expansion, computerization and diversification that seemed dizzying except when compared with the changes that followed.
 Mr. Wriston redefined banking as he erased rules that had long constrained banks, from operating across state lines to competing with Wall Street investment firms to paying small savers the same interest rates as large investors. By pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into automated teller machines and other technological improvements, he revolutionized the way Americans handle their money. The company, now named Citigroup, also came to dominate the credit card business.
 From the fiscal crisis of New York City in the 1970's to the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's, Mr. Wriston was at the forefront. He led the way in creating the financial supermarkets of today -- offering insurance, brokerage services and even data-processing and real estate development services.
 His final positions were chairman and chief executive of both Citibank and its holding company, then Citicorp. Previously, holding companies had been more common among smaller banks; Mr. Wriston was instrumental in adopting them to the needs of larger banks, allowing them to offer more services. 
 Under Mr. Wriston's 17 years of leadership, Citicorp's assets grew by 761 percent, to $150.6 billion; its net income by 764 percent, to $890 million; and its loans by 937 percent, to $102.7 billion. But he also left the company with hundreds of millions of bad loans to poor countries, a hole that took the better part of a decade to dig out of. Ultimately, the company prospered and in 1998 merged with Travelers Group Inc. in a $84 billion deal to become the world's largest financial company. It was renamed Citigroup. 
 John F. McGillicuddy, the former chairman of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said yesterday that Mr. Wriston was ''the acknowledged leader of our generation of bankers.'' Mr. McGillicuddy said that Citibank was the first to make profitability its principal goal rather than simply having a good balance sheet.
 ''He changed banking from a relatively slow-moving institution to a fast-moving institution,'' Mr. McGillicuddy said.
 Paul A. Volcker, who as chairman of the Federal Reserve System, sparred with Mr. Wriston over banking regulations, said that he believed that the Citicorp chairman saw himself ''as a rival of the Federal Reserve in terms of his influence on the banking system.''
 When asked to describe Mr. Wriston, Mr. Volcker said, ''The word aggressive keeps coming back.''
 In particular, the two clashed over Mr. Wriston's contention that banks no longer needed high levels of capital as long as they were profitable, well managed and growing. In the end, Mr. Wriston won out: capital restrictions today are much lower.
 One of his early innovations, developed with another First National City executive in 1961, was a revolutionary financial instrument -- the negotiable certificate of deposit, or C.D. The bank proposed to offer these to corporations in denominations of $100,000 or more at higher interest rates. They attracted surplus cash that corporations had on hand from time to time, and were quickly imitated by other banks.
 As chairman of Citicorp, he continued an expansion of foreign and domestic branches he had begun as executive vice president, extending it to 41 states and 91 nations. Employees grew from 26,900 to 71,000.
 ''He is more responsible for the current landscape of American global banking than anyone in the 20th century,'' Phillip L. Zweig, author of ''Wriston: Walter Wriston, Citibank and the Rise and Fall of American Financial Supremacy'' (Crown, 1995), said yesterday.
 Mr. Wriston was not without his critics. Ralph Nader in 1973 issued a 406-page report denouncing Citibank, saying that, among other things, it cheated customers and underpaid employees.
 The bank issued a point-by-point rebuttal, with a forward by Mr. Wriston accusing Mr. Nader of ''reckless misuse of facts.''
 Walter Bigelow Wriston was born in Middletown, Conn., on Aug. 3, 1919. His father, Henry Merritt Wriston, was a history professor at Wesleyan University who would later achieve distinction as president of Brown University and as an adviser to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His mother, the former Ruth Colton Bigelow, was a chemistry teacher.
 In 1925, the family moved to Appleton, Wis., where Henry was named president of Lawrence College. In an interview in Vision magazine in 1976, Henry said the family ''never had any money in the house.''
 He added, ''Walter was not brought up on Easy Street.''
 The boy was raised as a strict Methodist and was forbidden to go to the movies or listen to the radio. He walked several miles to school, often in subzero temperatures. He became an Eagle Scout at 15, and excelled at debating.
 When he enrolled at Wesleyan, he first majored in chemistry but switched to history because chemistry labs and basketball practice conflicted. He edited the college newspaper and won a prize for public speaking. 
 After earning a master's degree from the Fletcher School of International Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, he immediately joined the State Department as a junior foreign service officer.
 He was drafted into the Army, and served 38 months in command of a Signal Corps unit in the Philippines. After he was discharged as a second lieutenant, he decided to look for work in New York City rather than rejoining the State Department.
 In June 1946, he reluctantly accepted a job as a junior inspector in the controller's office of First National City Bank. He promised himself he would leave within a year if it was as boring as he expected.
 But his ''dart hit the board'' in a phrase Current Biography attributed to Mr. Wriston. He began to climb the ranks and he eventually attracted the attention of George S. Moore, who was in charge of the expansion of international operations.
 Mr. Moore chose him as his assistant on the basis of an evaluation that described Mr. Wriston as the most brilliant young man who had ever worked at the bank. By 1960, he had become executive vice president.
 In 1967, Mr. Wriston succeeded Mr. Moore as president of the bank. That year, First National City edged past the Chase Manhattan Bank, headed by David Rockefeller, to become the biggest bank in New York City. In the world, the bank was then second only to Bank of America.
 As president, Mr. Wriston immediately reorganized the corporation into five groups, ranging from personal banking to an investment management group able to provide every conceivable financial service to some 7,000 institutions and individuals of high worth. 
 The holding company called Citicorp was set up in 1968, a move that allowed the company to engage in activities normally prohibited to banks. Among other things, the corporation extended its small leasing business into an international operation that by 1973 was the world's largest, supplying everything from jumbo jets to gumball machines.
 In May 1970, Mr. Wriston succeeded Mr. Moore as chairman of the bank and holding company. He immediately set a goal of a 15 percent annual increase in earnings, a target considerably higher than the 10 percent or lower earnings growth rate of the 1960's. With the exception of 1975, a recession year, the goal was met.
 ''We have zero interest in asset growth,'' Mr. Wriston told Vision in 1976. ''What we're interested in being is the most profitable financial services business in the world, and we are.''
 Perhaps Mr. Wriston's most revolutionary achievement was setting up the first network of A.T.M.'s, which allowed customers to do their banking at any time, rather than depending on a human teller from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Citicorp's initial investment was $50 million and it developed the technology internally. 
 When Mr. Wriston received the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently, he said the bank ''got a lot of flak'' for the necessarily impersonal nature of A.T.M.'s. Ads of competitors spoke of ''smiling young ladies who remember your name,'' he said.
 Mr. Wriston said, ''And the answer to that was at 7:30 at night when you go to the movies and you don't have any money, you like the soulless machine.''
 Mr. Zweig said that Mr. Wriston craftily brought women into management positions by identifying them in documents only by their initials. Some directors in particular could not imagine women in the executive dining room, Mr. Zweig said.
 Mr. Wriston, who also aggressively recruited minority employees, was known for his wide knowledge and sharp wit. When a New York State legislator accused the bank of peddling risky bonds during the fiscal crisis without warning people of possible problems, Mr. Wriston held up The Daily News with the front-page headline: ''City Broke.''
 He suggested that this news in a paper read by millions constituted adequate disclosure.
 Citibank was once accused of both lagging in making loans to the poor and seducing them into borrowing more money than they should. Mr. Wriston, a commanding 6-foot-4, gibed, ''Do I have a third choice?''
 He sometimes displayed his erudition in pop music by dropping snatches of songs into otherwise solemn discussions, The New York Times reported in 1985. On the frustrations of having too little knowledge to make a sensible decision, he paused before warbling, ''I don't know enough about you.'' His blue eyes twinkled. 
 Mr. Wriston's first wife, the former Barbara Bengle, died in 1966. He is survived by his wife, the former Kathryn Dineen; his daughter, Catherine, of Darien, Conn.; and two grandchildren.
 During his retirement Mr. Wriston wrote several books about business and technology, and served on numerous boards. Small, innovative technology companies especially intrigued him. Fortune magazine in 1999 asked him why.
 ''Well, if I'm not awfully careful, I learn something,'' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Jan. 21 about Walter B. Wriston, who was chairman of Citicorp when it was the holding company for Citibank, misstated the name it bore when he went to work there in 1946. It was the National City Bank of New York; it became the First National City Bank in 1955.

HEADLINE: For Democrats, It's Topas: Tired of Pataki Alphabet Soup

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
With the release of his 11th annual budget proposal for New York State, George E. Pataki can fairly lay claim to a new honorific: The A-LOV-GOV, or acronym-loving-governor, whose favorite state programs boil down to a hearty alphabet soup.
 AIM and SPUR and Impact and Safe-T and Heal-N.Y. -- they are all among the new or expanding initiatives that received glowing praise in Mr. Pataki's 13-page budget speech on Tuesday. Yet his MOAA, or Mother of All Acronyms, had to be the STAR program (which stands for School Tax Relief). Under the new budget plan, STAR would spawn not one but two spinoffs: Co-STAR, offering tax cuts for county and city taxpayers, and STAR-Plus, a new property tax credit. 
 Leading Democrats have been giddily mocking Mr. Pataki's wordplay, perhaps a measure of the hostility in the Legislature, which has trouble agreeing on even the smallest issues.
 At a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, according to two Democrats who were there, Mr. Pataki's ''S.B.E.'' program (a label that stands for Sound Basic Education) was carved up in jest: S was changed to ''significant'' and E to ''effort,'' while B became a profane word that may be typical in the corridors of power, or barnyards, but not in a family newspaper. The Democrats also chided Mr. Pataki for aiming too low with Co-STAR, when the words Mega-Star were available.
 The Senate Democratic leader, David A. Paterson, said that the acronyms were just a flashy sounding way to add zip to ''warmed over'' initiatives and tax cuts that the governor has been proposing and re-proposing for three terms.
 ''With all the mnemonics -- STAR and Co-STAR and SPUR and S.B.E. and AIM and HEAL -- there's also C.Y.A., but I won't tell you what it stands for,'' Mr. Paterson said. (An aide later said that C.Y.A. stood for another unprintable expression, this one for watching out for one's backside.)
 ''I find that the governor is a bit obsessive about words; if he uses 'bold' once, he'll use it 21 times,'' Mr. Paterson added, referring to Mr. Pataki's repetition of that word in his annual address to the Legislature earlier this month. ''These acronyms are a technique, but they leave you with the impression that he's giving a performance, rather than a plan.''
 New York has a long, rich history with acronyms: Unlike most states, for instance, the public university systems are known by their acronyms, SUNY and CUNY, and the state's major student financial aid program also goes by one, TAP.
 The acronyms were one of the first things that Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is running for governor, brought up when he was asked to assess Mr. Pataki's budget speech.
 He singled out Mr. Pataki's newly proposed Operation SPUR -- the Strategic Partnership for Upstate Resurgence, a seven-part effort focused on economic development. He said he would be more ambitious than Mr. Pataki in promoting job growth and economic incentives in cities and towns west of the Hudson River. ''Let's get rid of the catchphrases and do a better job,'' said Mr. Spitzer, who did not attend the speech but watched 15 minutes of it on television.
 Michael Marr, a spokesman for the state's Division of the Budget, shrugged off the pokes at acronyms, saying they were shorthand for New Yorkers to cite and remember programs that could benefit them.
 ''Anyone who attended, read or saw the speech would know the real message was about protecting real property taxpayers,'' Mr. Marr said. ''If anyone needs a lesson on what STAR is, they can ask any homeowner.''

HEADLINE: Cheney Says Israel Might 'Act First' on Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Just hours before being sworn in for a second term, Vice President Dick Cheney publicly raised the possibility on Thursday that Israel ''might well decide to act first'' to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
 In an interview on the MSNBC program ''Imus in the Morning,'' a highly unusual forum for Mr. Cheney, he appeared to use the danger of Israeli military action as one more reason that the Iranians should reach a diplomatic agreement to disarm, noting dryly that any such strike would leave ''a diplomatic mess afterwards'' and should be avoided. 
 President Bush, in his inaugural speech on Thursday, appeared to have Iran, among other countries, in mind when he said he was committed to ''the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.'' 
 After defending the administration's decision to invade Iraq, Mr. Cheney, who appeared on the show with his wife, Lynne, was asked about the Iranian threat. ''We believe they have a fairly robust new nuclear program,'' Mr. Cheney said of the Iranians, carefully not using the word ''weapons,'' though in the American and European intelligence communities there is a widespread belief that the program is intended to build a nuclear arsenal. 
 He also said that Iran ''is a noted sponsor of terror,'' particularly in its support for Hezbollah, and that the combination of nuclear technology and terrorism ''is of great concern.''
 ''You look around at potential trouble spots, Iran is right at the top of the list,'' he said.
 Mr. Cheney focused on diplomacy, not military action, as the key to the Iranian situation. 
 ''At some point, if the Iranians don't live up to their commitments, the next step will be to take it to the U.N. Security Council, and seek the imposition of international sanctions,'' he said, restating the administration's longstanding position.
 Europe has opposed any such move, saying it would only drive Iran to break out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and openly pursue an atomic weapon, the path that North Korea took two years ago.
 Don Imus, who during the election campaign made no secret of his dislike of the policies of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, then asked, ''Why don't we make Israel do it?'' It was a reference to a military option much discussed in Washington but rarely talked about in public by top officials.
 ''Well, one of the concerns people have is that Israel might do it without being asked,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''If, in fact, the Israelis became convinced the Iranians had a significant nuclear capability, given the fact that Iran has a stated policy that their objective is the destruction of Israel, the Israelis might well decide to act first, and let the rest of the world worry about cleaning up the diplomatic mess afterwards.''
 ''We don't want a war in the Middle East, if we can avoid it,'' he said. ''In the case of the Iranian situation, I think everybody would be best suited or best treated and dealt with if we could deal with it diplomatically.''
 Mr. Cheney's remarks came at what appears to be a critical moment in the administration's internal debate over how to deal with Iran. For more than a year the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies have been intently focused on identifying Iranian nuclear facilities. Some of that information has been shared with the International Atomic Energy Agency to guide its inspections.
 Mr. Imus, unable to resist the temptation to tease Mr. Cheney about his reputation as the real decision maker in the White House, also asked him: ''Do you want to be president now?''
 ''No,'' the vice president said, with no hesitation.
 Mr. Imus pressed: ''Are you the president now?''
 ''No,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''But that was a nice try.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A subheading on Jan. 21 about remarks on Iran by Vice President Dick Cheney on an MSNBC program referred incorrectly to that country's nuclear program. As the article said, there is a widespread belief that the program is intended to build a nuclear arsenal. There is no evidence that Iran currently has nuclear weapons. A reader e-mailed The Times this week about the error and said he had sent an earlier message, which apparently went astray.

HEADLINE: Loyalty Prevails Over Money in Guggenheim Showdown

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Usually the richest man wins.
 That's what makes the departure of Peter B. Lewis -- chairman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and its biggest donor -- on Wednesday a bit surprising. Mr. Lewis has characterized the three-hour meeting at which he announced his decision as amicable. But no matter how decorous, the meeting ultimately amounted to a showdown between Mr. Lewis and the Guggenheim's director, Thomas Krens. 
 For years the two had diverged on what the museum's focus should be. Mr. Krens was interested in creating Guggenheim satellites around the world to build on the raging success of its showy outpost in Bilbao. Mr. Lewis felt that Mr. Krens should keep the museum's attention on New York, getting the finances of the mother ship in order and perhaps seeking once again to open a branch elsewhere in the city.
 Each came to the conflict with distinct advantages. Mr. Lewis had money behind him. A Cleveland auto insurance magnate who had served the board since 1993, he has given the museum about $77 million over all, nearly four times as much as any other board member in its history.
 That kind of money is manna to arts institutions, given the decline in contributions from foundations, corporations and individuals and the decline in government support.
 Mr. Krens, on the other hand, apparently had the board behind him. In his 17 years as director, despite financial ups and downs and controversial programming that included shows featuring motorcycles and Armani fashion, he had fostered loyalty from most of the trustees. 
 Mr. Krens declined to comment yesterday. Several members of the board did not return calls. A spokeswoman for Mr. Lewis said that he was traveling yesterday and unavailable for comment.
 Anthony Calnek, a spokesman for the museum, said of Mr. Krens and Mr. Lewis, ''I think they had a very successful partnership.''
 That Mr. Krens emerged triumphant after years of tension with Mr. Lewis is highly unusual. As cultural organizations have grown increasingly dependent on the largess of generous individuals, big donors have increasingly called the shots.
 When Alberto Vilar, a Cuban-American money manager and major opera donor, offered to support the San Francisco Opera, he did so on the condition that the company choose between two of his candidates for general director. When neither was chosen, Mr. Vilar shifted his backing to the Los Angeles Opera. 
 The chairman of American Ballet Theater, Lewis S. Ranieri, has become that company's largest donor and in turn has been able to make decisions on spending, like increasing advertising to promote the troupe and adding a week to the fall performance schedule, both of which he personally underwrote.
 Leonard A. Lauder, the chairman of the Whitney Museum of American Art, has been that museum's most generous donor and a hands-on decision maker. When the museum made its biggest acquisition, buying $200 million worth of artworks in 2002, for example, he selected most of the art. 
 But at the Guggenheim, Mr. Krens bucked the trend. At a time when commerce typically trumps art, the museum's director managed to be the one left standing.
 Until now it looked as if Mr. Lewis had the upper hand. In 2002 he gave the museum $12 million to help clean up its financial situation and told Mr. Krens that if he didn't cut spending he would be out of a job.
 The museum's annual spending in New York had peaked at $48 million in 1999; the staff was slashed from 391 to 181 people in 2001; and Mr. Krens was forced to use endowment funds to cover operating expenses.
 Mr. Krens tightened spending, yet kept pursuing his vision of a world full of architecturally distinctive Guggenheims -- in Taichung, Taiwan (designed by Zaha Hadid), Rio de Janeiro (Jean Nouvel) and Guadalajara, Mexico (to be designed by Mr. Nouvel, Enrique Norten or Hani Rashid/Asymptote). 
 Mr. Lewis said he believed that if the Guggenheim were to expand, it should do so in New York. A plan to build a $950 million Guggenheim designed by Frank Gehry on the waterfront in Lower Manhattan unraveled in December 2002 because of a lack of funds. Last July, the possibility surfaced of a Gehry-designed Guggenheim on the far West Side of Manhattan as part of the Jets Stadium project. From the city's point of view, a Guggenheim satellite could serve the purpose of lessening criticism of the stadium. 
 Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of the Related Companies, a real estate concern, recently joined the Guggenheim board. He is a friend of Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development in New York City who is leading the push for the stadium.
 Given the financial pressure on arts groups, it will be hard for the Guggenheim to replace Mr. Lewis's support. Perhaps in anticipation of Mr. Lewis's defection, Mr. Krens added five wealthy trustees in the last year, including Mr. Ross and William Mack, a founder and managing partner of Apollo Real Estate Advisers, and now the museum's acting chairman as well as its president.
 Mr. Ross and Mr. Mack -- together with Kenneth A. Himmel, the president and chief executive of the Palladium Company -- developed the $1.7 billion Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. 
 Still, it is difficult to imagine any new chairman matching the will of the mercurial Mr. Lewis. In Cleveland, for example, Mr. Lewis withdrew his support from every cultural and charitable organization in the city to pressure Case Western Reserve University's board to use more fiscal restraint or to resign. 
 Mr. Krens, a motorcycle-riding 6-foot-5-inch graduate of the Yale School of Management is equally colorful. During his tenure as director, he has become an art world celebrity and a lightning rod in the museum world. 
 For a time Mr. Lewis seemed to value Mr. Krens' risk-taking approach, even as he felt compelled to rein it in. But a comment that Mr. Lewis made on the occasion of his 2002 ultimatum to Mr. Krens now seems prescient. ''He is a maverick, I am a maverick,'' Mr. Lewis said at the time. ''I like Tom, but I am down to tough love. We are going to make this right this time, or else someone is going to have to go.''

HEADLINE: BUSH, AT 2ND INAUGURAL, SAYS SPREAD OF LIBERTY IS THE 'CALLING OF OUR TIME'

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Reporting for articles about the inauguration was contributed by Edmund L. Andrews, Joel Brinkley, John Files, Ray Hernandez, David Johnston, David D. Kirkpatrick, Anne E. Kornblut, Eric Lichtblau, Kristen A. Lee, Neil A. Lewis, Courtney C. Radsch, David E. Rosenbaum, David E. Sanger, Ian Urbina and Brian Wingfield.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
George Walker Bush was sworn in on Thursday for a second time as the 43rd president of the United States, and in an Inaugural Address striking for its idealism told Americans that spreading liberty around the world was ''the calling of our time'' and that the nation's ''vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.'' 
 Mr. Bush, 58, whose career in elective politics began only a decade ago as the governor of Texas, took the oath of office at 11:56 a.m. under broken clouds from an ailing Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who is critically ill with thyroid cancer and spoke in a hoarse voice. 
 With his hand on the same family Bible used in his first inauguration, Mr. Bush stood by his wife, Laura, and began his second term as a leader tested and altered by the terrible events of one day in his first. 
 But in the first presidential inauguration since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Bush only alluded in his address to what he called a ''day of fire'' and did not mention the two wars he waged in response. As general as his words were, they were intended to justify the invasion of Iraq and to offer a reason for Americans to be patient with his efforts to quell a violent insurgency there.
 His speech was infused with a deliberate sense of timelessness, and it often seemed as though his words were directed as much to history as to the crowd of invited Republicans, who huddled on the snow-covered lawn beneath the West Front of the Capitol. 
 ''At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together,'' Mr. Bush said in his 21-minute address, which was interrupted briefly by hecklers. ''For half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of Communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical -- and then there came a day of fire.''
 As a testimony to that conflagration, Washington was fortified for the inauguration in a show of force unseen in previous years. More than 100 blocks of downtown were closed to traffic. An additional security perimeter was set up around the White House and the inaugural parade route on Pennsylvania Avenue, requiring people to pass through metal detectors.
 More than 10,000 law enforcement officers were stationed around the Capitol, the White House and Pennsylvania Avenue, and at some points they stood four deep along the route for the parade held after the oath of office and Mr. Bush's address. The police estimated that 100,000 people watched the ceremony and the parade in person.
 The federal authorities said they knew of no reported threats to the inauguration. As the evening wore on without incident, Mr. Bush and Mrs. Bush briefly danced at nine inaugural balls. 
 Along the parade route, the crowd cheered and at times roared its approval as Mr. Bush's motorcade passed, but protesters also jeered and waved signs like ''Evil Rules in the Land of Fools'' and ''Worst President Ever.'' Three blocks from the White House, protesters burned a flag and tried to push through a security gate. The District of Columbia police said they used pepper spray to break up a shoving match between officers and protesters at the start of the parade, The Associated Press reported.
 Rolling slowly along the parade route from the Capitol to the White House in his armor-plated limousine, Mr. Bush was surrounded by a defensive phalanx of trucks, cars, a large bus and dozens of Secret Service agents. Unlike the leisurely strolls along the route by other presidents, Mr. Bush did not get out of the car until he reached the highly secure area near the White House, beyond the protesters.
 Then Mr. Bush and Mrs. Bush walked the length of the White House complex, about three blocks, before looping back to the glassed-in reviewing stand in front of the North Lawn to take their seats with family, friends and senior members of the administration.
 Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's nominee for secretary of state, who just went through two contentious days of Senate hearings only to have her confirmation delayed by Democrats, was captured by television cameras yawning broadly in a back row.
 As is customary when the cabinet gathers for presidential speeches, one cabinet member stays away in case of attack or disaster. On Thursday, it was Gale A. Norton, secretary of the interior.
 The somewhat forced spirit of partisan comity that hung over the Capitol during the inauguration was much less evident inside the building, and Republicans were fuming over the decision by Democrats to hold up Ms. Rice's confirmation. Administration officials had intended for Ms. Rice to be sworn in Thursday to succeed Colin L. Powell.
 On the inaugural platform, Mr. Bush was seated near Vice President Dick Cheney, who was sworn in for a second term by the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, only minutes before Mr. Bush took the oath. The president was accompanied by his parents; his twin 23-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara; his three brothers; and his sister. 
 There were 146 members of the Bush clan in Washington for the celebration, and the president's immediate family attended the traditional lunch after the swearing-in ceremony at the Statuary Hall of the Capitol. Guests ate quail breasts, scalloped lobster and crab, and braised turnips, beets and rutabagas -- a menu inspired by food served during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt and by game shot on the Lewis and Clark expedition in the early 1800's. 
 ''I want to thank my brothers and sisters,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They have meant a lot to me. Their unconditional love is an important part of keeping perspective here in the nation's capital.''
 The man Mr. Bush defeated to win a second term, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, also attended the swearing-in ceremony as a member of Congress, sitting in a highly visible spot at the edge of the inaugural platform. Mr. Kerry chatted with fellow senators, waved to acquaintances in the crowd and clapped politely throughout Mr. Bush's address. Mr. Bush made no mention of him. 
 Mr. Bush did single out the three former presidents on the platform behind him, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, the man who denied Mr. Bush's father a second term. But unlike four years ago, when Mr. Bush shared history with the departing Mr. Clinton and the raw emotions surrounding the disputed 2000 election, this time the stage was his alone.
 The Inaugural Address, composed by a speechwriter, Michael Gerson, and edited by the president through 21 drafts, bore a strong personal stamp of Mr. Bush in its optimism and its belief in the transforming powers of freedom. It sidestepped many of the unpleasant realities in Baghdad, although it seemed to address directly the election in Iraq that is to be held in just 10 days. 
 ''Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own.''
 America, he said, ''will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom and make their own way.''
 Mr. Bush spoke in terms intended to rally Americans behind a moral crusade against despotism. He said that ''America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.''
 Mr. Bush recited the brief oath of office with the crisp confidence of a leader who had survived four tumultuous, polarizing years and a hard-fought re-election race. 
 In his first term, he redefined national security policy after the terrorist attacks, saying the United States would consider itself free to act pre-emptively to head off threats. His exercise of that doctrine in Iraq divided Americans from the start, and even more so after it turned out that he was wrong in asserting that Saddam Hussein held stockpiles of banned weapons.
 As in foreign policy, Mr. Bush governed boldly when it came to domestic policy, running up big victories like the tax cuts he pushed through Congress. He called himself a ''compassionate conservative,'' but his opponents sometimes lamented that he was much more the latter. 
 Mr. Bush headed back to the White House on Thursday afternoon having already started one of the most ambitious second-term agendas any president has offered. But over the last few weeks, it has become clear that his party is not going to blindly follow him on his proposal to overhaul Social Security, and that Democrats, while trying to regain their footing after their electoral defeat in November, are inclined to fight rather than compromise on many fronts.
 Although Mr. Bush's Inaugural Address emphasized the transforming nature of liberty as a global force, he sought to tie that theme to his domestic agenda and the broader conservative push to move away from reliance on government as a solution to problems. He linked individual freedom to personal responsibility, character and an ''ownership society'' that makes ''every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny.''
 ''Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self,'' Mr. Bush said. ''That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran and the varied faiths of our people.''
 But the president quickly warned against equating freedom with selfish individualism, saying, ''Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.''
 In seeking a new balance between the collective and the individual, Mr. Bush said it is time to modernize economic institutions. Chief among those he mentioned was Social Security, which Democrats point to as the most successful expression of the belief in the government's ability to step in where market forces fail, but which many Republicans see as in need of the potential financial gains offered by those same forces.
 ''By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal,'' Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: The Invasion of the Midsize Movie

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
This year's Oscar nominations will be announced on Tuesday, smack in the middle of the Sundance Film Festival, a coincidence of the calendar that might be taken to represent a larger convergence. For three-quarters of a century the Academy Awards have been Hollywood's annual official tribute to itself while Sundance, from its humble beginnings in the early 1980's, has flourished as the official alternative to Hollywood -- an annual celebration of that elusive entity called independent film.
 The antagonism between the two has always been a bit overstated. The label ''independent'' has, like ''low fat'' or ''all-natural,'' never been subject to rigorous regulation, and while low-budget, idiosyncratic movies seem to offer filmgoers a ticket out of the mainstream, they have also been, for many filmmakers, a ticket in. This has been true for at least 15 years, but more recently a new synthesis has emerged. Independent film may be dead, as so many of its partisans continually proclaim, but if it is, it has been reincarnated in the shape of another much-mourned, perpetually misunderstood movie martyr, the studio system. 
 If you sift through the litter of critics' top 10 lists or browse the Web sites of various award-giving organizations -- or, for that matter, if you peruse the advertisements that give this section of the newspaper its awards-season bulk -- you might notice the predominance of a certain kind of movie. I don't mean a genre; ''House of Flying Daggers,'' ''A Very Long Engagement,'' ''Sideways,'' ''The Motorcycle Diaries'' and ''Hotel Rwanda,'' to take a few prominent examples, don't have much in common when it comes to their stories or their cinematic styles. But all of them originated within what are sometimes called the specialty divisions of the major studios, an awkward name that refers to subsidiary companies -- Sony Pictures Classics and Paramount Classics, Warner Independent, Focus Features, Fox Searchlight -- dedicated to distributing and, increasingly, to producing movies that tend to attract equally awkward descriptions. Art films? Indies? Director-driven projects? Prestige products? Oscar-bait? Serious movies for grown-up audiences?
 All of the above -- at least some of the time. But perhaps it's best to think of the output of these companies as middle-size movies. In 1968, during her brief tenure as chief film critic for The New York Times, Renata Adler published an essay called ''Patience for the Transition to Little Films'' in which she proposed that ''the days of the single, grand film for everyone are nearly gone'' and suggested that an audience seeking the traditional pleasures of moviegoing would be well advised to seek them out in smaller packages. The article may not stand up as prophecy -- the next decade would bring ''Love Story,'' the first two ''Godfather'' pictures, ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'' -- but Ms. Adler did identify one of the cycles that governs both the movie industry and the public taste. 
 Today the major studios, most of them housed within larger multimedia conglomerates, are most heavily invested in building entertainment franchises that can generate huge profits around the world -- movies whose budgets and revenue are counted in hundreds of millions of dollars and whose appeal must be calculated on a similarly wide scale. But the appetite of a significant portion of the domestic audience for other kinds of movies -- and for movies from other countries -- along with the desire of actors and directors to pursue challenging and artistically satisfying work, have combined to open up a fertile middle ground, which the specialty divisions have claimed as their own. This middle ground can be defined economically -- the films in question are neither extravagant would-be blockbusters nor shoestring, seat-of-the-pants productions -- and culturally. The public they seek is neither the global mass audience nor a coterie of cinephiles, but rather something -- ideally something profitable, as well as Oscar-worthy -- in between.

The 80's Revisited
 The high-quality, middle-size movie is not a new phenomenon. Nor, for that matter, is the idea of carving out a niche within larger companies in which such movies can be nurtured. Film executives (and movie fans) whose memories stretch back to the 1980's remember the specialty-division boom in that decade, and the short-lived epiphany of the 1986 Oscars, when Geraldine Page won the best actress award for ''The Trip to Bountiful'' and William Hurt won best actor for ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' both of them distributed by the long-defunct Island Pictures. 
 ''Back in 1982, I was in charge of marketing for Columbia's specialty division,'' said Mark Urman, now the head of distribution at ThinkFilm, an independent distributor. ''I turned around and every company had one, and then a few years later nobody had one. It was a trend, a cycle. Part of me thinks we're seeing that all over again.''
 Certainly, at this point, nearly every company has one, the newest being Warner Brothers, whose Warner Independent label released its first film, Richard Linklater's ''Before Sunset,'' last summer. The other relative newcomers are Universal's Focus, which came into existence in 2002, and Fox Searchlight, which has existed in its current form for about five years. 
 Of the existing specialty divisions, Sony Pictures Classics, which started in 1991 and grew out of Orion Classics, is the oldest. And then, of course, there is Miramax, which has mutated since the 1980's from an independent distributor into Disney's specialty division and then into a quasi-major studio in its own right, and whose future is currently the subject of much speculation, as its founders, Harvey and Bob Weinstein, negotiate their separation from Disney. But whatever happens on that front, the current proliferation of studio art-house divisions may be a sign that we have entered the post-Miramax era. 
 ''Miramax has ceded their place as the Microsoft of the business,'' said Mark Gill, president of Warner Independent, who worked at Miramax as head of marketing and went on to run the studio's Los Angeles office, ''so more movies are getting made, there's more room for them, and more diversity.''

Wide Variety, Common Approach
 This diversity is clear enough from a glance at the range of movies these companies -- which will inevitably take turns being labeled ''the next Miramax -- released in 2004. They included literary adaptations (Paramount Classics' ''Enduring Love,'' Warner's ''We Don't Live Here Anymore,'' Focus's ''Vanity Fair''), costume dramas (Sony's ''Being Julia'' and ''House of Flying Daggers'') and offbeat coming-of-age stories (''Garden State'' and ''Napoleon Dynamite,'' both from Fox Searchlight). 
 Each studio offers a slightly different blend of styles, genres and sensibilities. From year to year the number of movies they release varies -- most hover between 8 and 12, though last year Sony Classics released more than 20 -- as do the ratios of English-language to subtitled films, of movies purchased for distribution to movies produced in-house or financed with partners, and, of course, of successes to disappointments. (The biggest success story of the year just ended was probably Fox Searchlight, with the summertime hit ''Napoleon Dynamite'' and the critically beloved ''Sideways.'')
 But though their approaches differ, and though they are frequently in competition for the attention of the same sectors of the audience, there seem to be certain principles that the specialty divisions hold in common. Interviews with some of the people who run them return, with remarkable consistency, to the importance of the director. 
 ''The politique des auteurs is still political with us,'' said James Schamus, co-president of Focus Features, referring to the idea, popularized by postwar French critics and imported to the United States by Andrew Sarris, that the art of film resides in the creative signature of the filmmaker. Peter Rice, president of Fox Searchlight, makes a similar point in plainer English. ''I think we're becoming more and more a director-based company,'' he said in a recent telephone conversation. ''Find an original voice, come with original material, be bold, and we'll back you.''

Slow-Motion Success
 The movies that result from this philosophy may not satisfy every taste -- which is exactly the point. ''The only reason I would ever make a film at Focus was if I was sure somebody would hate it,'' Mr. Schamus said. ''We make movies that are precisely not for everyone.'' 
 Focus's 2004 releases included ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' a film by the Brazilian director Walter Salles about the young Che Guevara's travels in South America, and ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,'' a heartfelt, brain-teasing romantic comedy directed by Michel Gondry from Charlie Kaufman's script. The company was born out of the merger of USA Pictures, an independent studio, and Good Machine, a production company Mr. Schamus used to run with Ted Hope. 
 In its first year of existence, Focus released ''The Pianist,'' which it had acquired at the Cannes Film Festival and which went on to win several Oscars, including best director for Roman Polanski and best actor for Adrien Brody. The following year it released Sofia Coppola's ''Lost in Translation,'' which won a host of critics' awards as well as the Oscar for best original screenplay.
 ''Lost in Translation,'' with its combination of originality and accessibility, its deft mixture of old-fashioned emotion and postmodern cool and its canny cross-generational appeal, may be the paradigmatic middle-size movie. Released in fall 2003, before the crush of holiday award-seekers, it was propelled through the awards season by critical enthusiasm and word of mouth, a pattern that is being repeated this year by ''Sideways,'' from Fox Searchlight, which won a Golden Globe for best motion picture (comedy or musical) on Sunday and which is likely to add a handful Oscar nominations to its long list of accolades. 
 Awards and nominations can propel a middle-size movie onto the larger cultural stage, as well as produce the kind of box-office returns that can pay for other such movies down the road. But the pursuit of this kind of recognition can be an expensive gamble, given the high costs of marketing, publicity, and new prints to enable an expanded release. ''One thing that's changed dramatically is the cost of media,'' saidTom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics. ''You didn't used to spend as much. Then people started the vanity spending -- Oscar campaigns for brand identification, spending your profit to get recognition. Everyone looks good in the media, but the accountant in the back room gets the bill two years later and says, what the hell were they doing?''
 Compared with their corporate siblings, the specialty divisions spend less on production and chase after relatively small returns. Fox Searchlight tries not to spend more than $15 million making a movie (according to Mr. Rice, ''Sideways'' cost around $16 million), much less than what the big studios routinely spend on action movies, or even romantic comedies. But the studios can open their franchise movies simultaneously on several thousand screens nationwide with an accompanying advertising blitz engineered to maximize opening-weekend grosses, while specialty films generally start out in one or two major cities and roll out gradually, dependent on critical good will and audience word of mouth as well as advertising. 
 So far ''Sideways,'' 13 weeks after its release, has made a little more than $28 million, a number that seems small until you consider that it has come from only 370 screens. (For comparison, consider that ''Coach Carter,'' the No.1 movie at the box office last week, made $24 million on more than 2,500 screens.) Today, ''Sideways'' expands to 800 screens, and next Friday, in the wake of the Oscar nominations, it will add another 1,000. 

Is the Box Office Irrelevant?
 Meanwhile, a glance at the box-office figures for some other well-reviewed, heavily marketed middle-size pictures reveals the challenges they face. ''House of Flying Daggers,'' which expanded last week to 1,200 screens, has so far brought in just under $7 million; ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' 17 weeks into its run, has made a little more than $16 million.
 ''The specialty divisions start out ambitious,'' Mr. Bernard said, ''bringing new and different films to the marketplace, but as they progress they become mirror images of the studios. The studio films can make a lot of money if they spend a lot of money; in the specialty divisions you can lose a lot of money if you spend a lot of money.'' 
 But the theatrical box office is no longer the only source of revenue, and may not even be the most important one. ''We are not in the business of making movies,'' Mr. Schamus said, not entirely facetiously. ''The movie experience you have when you buy a ticket is subsidizing an ad campaign for a DVD and a cable show. You are legitimizing that by letting us pretend that it is a movie.''
 In other words, a film's initial run can be the seed of a longer process of cultural absorption and audience exposure, which bears fruit in DVD sales and rentals, as audiences go back to catch up on what they've missed.
 ''More and more, the movie business is becoming like the music business,'' Mr. Gill said. ''The question is not can you get the movie made, but can you get anyone to go?'' And here the abundance of middle-size movies can start to look like a glut, and their high visibility in awards season can be perceived as a threat to the very adventurous spirit -- the independence, you might say -- whose triumph they nonetheless represent. 
 ''I think it's wonderful and I think it's awful,'' Mr. Urman said of the current ascendance of the specialty divisions. ''My concern,'' he continued, ''is that moviegoers, if they feel they have satisfied their quotient for alternatives with something that is readily available and omnipresent and advertised -- they don't have to pick up a magazine, don't have to work, don't have to read much. The film has big stars. They see it and say, I'm smart; they congratulate themselves, and that keeps them from seeing the really challenging film'' 
 But it may also be possible -- it can, at any rate, be hoped -- that some of the audience will be led by the middle-size movies toward more difficult and specialized pleasures, toward the little films that will continue to occupy the vanguard of this constantly evolving art form. 
 ''I like that our filmmakers get to expand the way you're allowed to tell a story,'' Mr. Schamus said. ''Maybe we're not Sun Ra, but we're John Coltrane ballads. We're still not at that Jazz at Lincoln Center moment, it's still very fun, not too institutionalized. We've found pockets within these large companies where there is an interest in this kind of freedom and creativity.''

HEADLINE: Disputes at Every Turn of Siberia Pipeline

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: PEREVOZNAYA, Russia 

 BODY:
Stretching from Lake Baikal to the Sea of Japan, the first trans-Siberian oil pipeline is to run 2,565 miles -- more than three times the length of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. With a price tag of $15.5 billion, it looms as modern Russia's biggest infrastructure investment, President Vladimir V. Putin's answer to the Trans-Siberian Railway of the czars.
 Because China and Japan both rely on the Middle East for about 85 percent of their oil imports, both economic giants competed fiercely over what could be the world's longest and most expensive oil pipeline. Trumping China with a more generous financing offer, Japan, the world's second-largest oil importer, hopes that the four-foot diameter pipe will bind it to Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter.
 It may be a decade before the pipeline is completed. But the line would increase by about a third Russia's capacity to export oil by pipeline and would be a major Russian shift toward the Pacific, where oil could be sold to any country, including the United States. 
 But the project still faces major hurdles. There are no guarantees there will be enough oil to fill the pipe, although Russia has as much as 67 billion barrels of untapped oil reserves along the pipeline route. When the oil reaches the Sea of Japan, there are no public commitments binding Russia to sell it to Japan, whose ports are only a day's sail away. And Russia's last-minute switch of the Pacific terminal site from an existing oil port to this pristine bay is already putting Japanese banks in the middle of a growing global environmental protest movement. 
 Contrary to the traditionally opaque nature of many major Russian investments, the pipeline is expected to come under rigorous international scrutiny. The Kremlin has vowed not to contribute government funds for the pipeline construction. Instead, Transneft, the government pipeline monopoly, has been told to go find its own financing, preferably on international markets.
 Foreign banks, especially the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, will increasingly face questions over the pipeline's future profitability and over Moscow's little-publicized decision in December to switch the pipeline terminus from Vostochny, Russia's main industrial port in the Pacific, to Perevoznaya, a tranquil bay.
 In the summer, the bay's sandy beaches and warm waters are frequented by ferry loads of beachgoers from Vladivostok, 10 miles to the east. In the winter, this frozen semiwilderness is home to some of the last 30 to 40 Amur leopards in the world. The Amur is one of 50 endangered species found only in this corner of Pacific Russia. 
 To get to the terminal and planned oil refinery, dozens of tankers would steam daily past Russia's only maritime nature reserve, a collection of 11 islands prized for 3,000 species, a rare wealth of biodiversity that comes from a meeting of boreal and subtropical water currents. Navigating a five-mile-wide channel littered with more small islands, the tankers would then enter a maritime cul-de-sac with such shallow waters and fragile ecology that environmentalists have started calling Perevoznaya Bay ''Siberia's Prince William Sound,'' evoking memories of the 1989 oil spill in Alaska by the oil tanker Exxon Valdez.
 ''We are already seeing the start of an environmental campaign on this issue, which is really going to grow in coming months,'' said David Gordon, executive director of Pacific Watch, an environmental group based in California. ''The pipeline will be a test case of whether or not Russia can meet the top-level environmental standards that the public expects from oil and gas projects around the world.''
 This winter, American and European environmentalists are organizing a campaign to persuade Moscow to build the pipeline terminal in Vostochny, a modern industrial port and railhead built 30 years ago next to Nakhodka. Adding urgency, May 1 is the new deadline for Transneft to devise a pipeline construction timetable and for the ministries of transport and defense to establish oil tanker shipping routes to Perevoznaya Bay.
 Last fall, Russian environmentalists began collecting signatures on petitions and writing letters of protest to President Putin and to Transneft, which plans to get the oil here by building the pipeline through one nature preserve and along the southern border of a second preserve.
 ''If the pipeline is to be built in this area, a tremendous part of the tiny leopard and tiger habitat will be cut off,'' Dimitri G. Pikunov, a Russian biologist, said one recent afternoon as he drove through Barsovy Wildlife Refuge, which would be bisected by the pipeline. Noting that the Siberian tiger has other strongholds in the maritime region, he added: ''If a port is built near this reserve, no animals will stay. And this area represents the leopard's last stand.''
 Anatoly Lebedev, a Vladivostok environmentalist leading the opposition campaign, said: ''It is obviously a crazy idea to kill all the recreational industry in the district, which offers generally cheap and accessible recreation on the sea coast for millions of Far Easterners and Siberians.''
 Anton Semenov, another environmentalist in Vladivostok, said he was worried that the bay's ''strong currents would carry oil from any spills far and wide.''
 The oil terminal project also presents a test between Japan's energy anxieties and its environmental concerns. Representatives of Japan's development bank have participated closely in negotiating possible financing for the project.
 Conceivably, this Japanese bank could finance up to 80 percent of the project, which would make it the largest loan in the bank's history. From an original price tag of $6 billion, costs have ballooned over the last two years, inflated by rising steel prices and the technical challenge of building across soils affected by differing conditions of permafrost.
 Although Japanese studies say there will be enough oil found near the pipeline route to fill the pipeline, skeptics say the line could be a 21st-century Trans-Siberian Railway -- a wonderful exercise in nation building that has never made a profit.
 Initially, the pipeline was to be far shorter, going to Skovorodino, a Siberian town 37 miles north of the Chinese border, and then angling south into northern China. A later version, had the pipeline forking at Skovorodino, with one third of the oil going to China, and two thirds going to Vostochny, and the open market. 
 But Japan overpowered China in the bidding, although, to appease China, Russia has promised to increase its annual oil shipments to China by rail to 300,000 barrels a day next year.
 China is the world's fastest-rising major oil consumer. By 2020, China's oil imports are to be double the 2004 level. By 2030, China may have more cars than the United States. But China would not match Japan's financing power, and Russia feared falling captive to one buyer.
 Moving aggressively, Japan offered $7 billion in soft loans for construction of the line and billions more to help Japanese oil companies find and develop oil in Eastern Siberia.
 Tokyo lobbied heavily to get the entire pipeline to the Sea of Japan -- 1.6 million barrels a day. Although oil supply guarantees have not been worked out, Japan, with its seaports only 275 miles to the southeast of Vladivostok, is expected to be the primary buyer. But much of the oil is expected to go on the open market, available for shipment to South Korea, China or even the United States.
 ''The Nakhodka route is undoubtedly a win-win not just for Russia, Japan, South Korea, and China, but also the United States,'' Helen Teplitskaia, president of the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, wrote in an e-mail message. ''New sources of oil, and should the idea of a parallel pipeline materialize, gas as well, will diversify the energy supply and ease dependence on the volatile Mideastern sources.''
 With Transneft keeping quiet about its decision to make Perevoznaya the terminus, many outsiders still believe that the planned route follows the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Nakhodka-Vostochny.
 But Japanese and American environmentalists are preparing to campaign to pressure the Japan Bank for International Cooperation to condition its loans on a Nakhodka terminus.
 ''Although we understand the pipeline construction is of great importance to the energy security of Japan, Friends of the Earth Japan believes that J.B.I.C. is not right if they start spending public money without looking at the environmental concerns, such as the possible threat to the survival of Amur leopards,'' Eiichiro Y. Noguchi, Russia program director for Friends of the Earth Japan, said in Tokyo.
 With a major environmental battle looming, the Japanese development bank is stepping cautiously.
 ''If J.B.I.C. considers the possibility of financing this project, we have to review, not only in terms of the financial aspect, but of the environmental point of view,'' Yoshimi Tamura, spokeswoman for the Japanese development bank, said in Tokyo.
 [American and European participation in pipeline construction contracts may be welcome, Victor Khristenko, the industry and energy minister of Russia, hinted last Friday at a news conference in Moscow. Speaking as Japan's visiting foreign minister, Nobutaka Machimura, listened, the Russian said, ''Russia counts on getting loans that won't be linked to the purchase of Japanese equipment or technology.'']
 In interviews in 2004, Sergei Darkin, governor of the Pacific Maritime region, was a determined backer of building the oil pipeline terminal and refinery in Perevoznaya. Mr. Darkin's local opponents, including Mayor Viktor S. Gnezdilov of Nakhodka, have accused Mr. Darkin of having financial interests in the Perevoznaya area. The governor has denied the accusation.
 It is unclear why Mr. Darkin has been able to persuade the Moscow-based pipeline company to shift the terminal to an area that he prefers.
 President Putin, who now has power to virtually hire and fire regional governors at will, is known to have chilly relations with Mr. Darkin. If Russian and international outcry becomes too strong, he could veto the plan to bring oil tankers into Perevoznaya Bay, part of the larger Peter the Great Bay, amid fears of threats to three nature reserves, the region's main beach resorts, and new fish farms for scallops and sea cucumbers.
 Two years ago, local environmentalists succeeded in halting a plan to open a coal mine in the middle of the Barsovy Refuge, the core habitat of the endangered leopards.
 ''People are not trying to eliminate the pipeline -- they realize it would be the lifeline of the economy,'' said Dale G. Miquelle, an American biologist here for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York. ''Nobody is saying, 'Don't do it.' They are just saying, 'Do it in the most sensible way.'''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress seethed Thursday over Democrats' refusal to allow a quick vote on Condoleezza Rice's confirmation as secretary of state, a dispute that provided a quick reality check about the partisan divide on Capitol Hill just hours after President Bush was sworn in.
 ''If this is the kind of comity we can expect for the rest of the session, we are not getting off to a good start,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a member of the Republican leadership. ''It is churlish.''
 Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, said, ''You want continuity in this country, and this is a senior cabinet minister.'' He added, ''This didn't win them any merit badges.'' 
 Members of both parties have already acknowledged that they expect a difficult session. Besides dealing with President Bush's initiative to overhaul Social Security, the Republican leadership has plans of its own. It wants to try to limit lawsuits that Republicans assert are hurting the economy and access to medical care, develop a budget and spending program that begins to reduce the deficit, consider changes in the tax code, advance stalled highway and energy measures and continue their Senate fight with Democrats over judicial nominations. 
 ''I think we ought to put the pedal to the metal,'' said Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, saying Republicans should be aggressive about using their greater numbers to overcome Democratic opposition.
 In delaying Ms. Rice's inevitable confirmation, Democrats said it was only reasonable to give their senators the chance to express their views given Ms. Rice's crucial role in developing the administration's Iraq and antiterror policies. Under an agreement, the nomination will be open to nine hours of debate beginning Tuesday with a vote expected Wednesday.
 ''Questions of foreign policy and particularly the Iraq war really center on her decisions in the first four years, and they want to speak to that,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip. ''I don't believe that waiting a few days will create any hardship.'' 
 Democrats have also delayed a vote on the nomination of Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, to be attorney general. Democrats did agree to the confirmations of Mike Johanns as secretary of agriculture and Margaret Spellings as secretary of education without requiring roll-call votes, and more nominations are expected to be cleared next week. 
 Looking ahead, the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, said in a statement Thursday, ''The next four years will not be easy, but with the leadership of President Bush and the Republican Congress, we will work toward four more years of success.''
 Mr. Bush's Inaugural Address was devoted more to his view of America's role in the world, and lawmakers said they would await details of his policy initiatives in the State of the Union address on Feb. 2. 
 But a proposal to change the Social Security system to allow workers to invest some of their own retirement income is expected to be a centerpiece of his second term.
 Several Republican lawmakers and senior legislative officials who asked not to be named because they did not want to alienate the president early in the debate said that there was as yet little enthusiasm in the president's own party for a broad overhaul of Social Security and that they were skeptical that the White House could push one through. Plus, some Republicans have ideas on how to change the program that are at odds with the president's. Democrats say the president is wading into perilous political and policy territory.
 ''I think they have a tiger by the tail on this one,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a new member of the Senate committee that oversees Social Security.
 Despite the undercurrent of partisan strife, there was ample talk of the opportunity for bipartisanship both in Mr. Bush's speech and in the halls of Congress as lawmakers gathered for the inaugural celebration.
 The Democratic leaders Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California had a cordial coffee with Mr. Bush at the White House before the ceremony. They said they welcomed his overtures at working together but also wanted to see if he and Congressional Republicans follow through.

HEADLINE: The Inaugural Address: 'The Best Hope for Peace in Our World Is the Expansion of Freedom in All the World'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's Inaugural Address yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 Vice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, members of the United States Congress, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: 
 On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed. 
 At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together. For a half-century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of Communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical. And then there came a day of fire. 
 We have seen our vulnerability and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny, prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder, violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. 
 We are led by events and common sense to one conclusion. The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. 
 America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth. 
 Across the generations, we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgent requirement of our nation's security and the calling of our time. 
 So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. 
 This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. 
 And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom and make their own way. 
 The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America's influence is not unlimited. But fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause.
 My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve and have found it firm. 
 We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation. The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies. 
 We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies. Yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators. They are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty. 
 Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny, because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it. 
 Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world.
 All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you. 
 Democratic reformers facing repression, prison or exile can know America sees you for who you are, the future leaders of your free country.
 The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did, ''Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.'' 
 The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know to serve your people, you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice and America will walk at your side. 
 And all the allies of the United States can know we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies' defeat. 
 Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens. 
 From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon. 
 Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well, a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power. It burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world. 
 A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy, the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments, the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives, and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice. 
 All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself, and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character. 
 America has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home, the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.
 In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act and the G.I. Bill of Rights.
 And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance, preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal. 
 In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character, on integrity and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today and forever. 
 In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. 
 Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time. 
 From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that cause? 
 These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes, and I will strive in good faith to heal them. 
 Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free. 
 We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability. It is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation. God moves and chooses as he wills. 
 We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our founders declared a new order of the ages, when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty, when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ''Freedom Now,'' they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the author of liberty. 
 When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said it rang as if it meant something. In our time, it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength, tested but not weary, we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom. 
 May God bless you, and may he watch over the United States of America.

HEADLINE: An Impresario Explores Life Without P.S. 122

BYLINE: By PHOEBE HOBAN

 BODY:
''I'm interested in dangerous theater, that's it,'' Mark Russell, the former artistic director of P.S. 122, said. ''I want something that is going to shake people up a little bit. I'm not interested in comfort-food theater.'' 
 For 21 years Mr. Russell served up anything but, transforming the red-brick public school on Ninth Street and First Avenue into a renowned performance space, and in the process fostering the careers of cutting-edge artists like Eric Bogosian, Karen Finley, Blue Man Group, John Leguizamo, Danny Hoch, Meredith Monk and Spalding Gray. 
 ''Mark tunes into the fringes of performance art,'' Mr. Bogosian said. ''He has a sort of sixth sense. It's hard to describe how he was able to look for things that nobody knew about yet. Ezra Pound once said that the 'artist is the antenna of the race.' Mark is the antenna of the antenna. He's an artist in his heart.'' 
 It's been just over a year since Mr. Russell announced, to the shock of the downtown cultural world, that he was resigning from P.S. 122, and found himself, somewhat unexpectedly, in the market for a new job. His sudden departure, widely seen as a forced resignation -- something Mr. Russell does not dispute -- was bittersweet. 
 ''After 20 years, Mark had accomplished everything he could accomplish,'' Donald Guarnieri, chairman of the P.S. 122 board, said.
 In November, the board announced that it had appointed Vallejo Gantner, 30, former director of the Dublin Fringe Festival, as the new artistic director. 
 Mr. Russell discussed his current activities over lunch recently. ''It's guerilla warfare,'' he said of operating without a permanent site. ''It's a different way of moving within the culture. It's a whole other thing for me because I don't just have to do things that fit between the four columns, and there's so many works that I want to present that I wasn't able to do at 122.''
 So Mr. Russell is trying to do what he does best: push the envelope. He organized the Under the Radar festival this month at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn and elsewhere. The offerings included Cynthia Hopkins's ''Accidental Nostalgia'' (through tomorrow) and ''K.I. From 'Crime''' (through Jan. 30). ''I was thrilled with the result,'' said Olga Garay, program director for the arts at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which financed Under the Radar and plans to do so again next year.
 Tonight he is presenting ''Big Voices'' at the Bowery Poetry Club, and he has been working with the French government on the Act French festival to be held July through December in New York City.
 ''Under the Radar was a very good title for Mark to choose for the festival,'' Susan Feldman, the artistic director of St. Ann's, said. ''Mark catches artists when they are at a very developmental raw state and doesn't worry about their production values. Spalding Gray didn't have to have a finished monologue to be on Mark's stage. He could be there working on that and founding a whole new form of monologues.''
 Mark Russell Projects, as Mr. Russell is calling his nascent production company, may be forging ahead, but Mark Russell himself is still adjusting to his new situation: after two decades at P.S. 122, his reputation and the downtown institution's are inextricably bound.
 ''One of the great dividends of being associated with P.S. 122 and with Mark was that people all over the world trusted his judgment,'' John Collins, an artistic director of the theater company Elevator Repair Service, said. ''If you were presented by Mark, that was an amazing kind of seal of approval.'' 
 There was a changing of the guard in the last year or so at a number of New York cultural landmarks, including the Kitchen, Dance Theater Workshop and the Public Theater. Still, while it may have been time to turn the reins over to a younger generation, Mr. Russell was hoping for a somewhat smoother transition.
 ''I would have rather mentored someone through,'' he said. ''But P.S. 122 should be a place for youth and run by young people who understand it. There are episodes of 'Scooby-Doo' I don't even know about.'' 
 Dressed head to toe in black, with a tiny gold hoop in each ear, Mr. Russell, 50, looks every inch the downtown impresario. ''I really wanted to die in my boots at P.S. 122.'' he said. ''That was my whole retirement plan. But after 9/11, we hit a really hard time in the arts, and for the last three years, I was really fighting an uphill battle privately. And when I realized I didn't have the votes on the board, I decided to resign. I had a great run at P.S. 122.'' 
 That run began in 1983. ''I was P.S. 122's first official employee,'' said Mr. Russell, who was born in Wisconsin and went to school in Austin, Tex. ''When you take on a place like that, you have to commit to being ready to do the toilets and spend all night and tear the tickets. I wish they had told me those were the golden years. I was being paid $150 a week, and that was with unemployment. So I had to hire and fire myself so I could get the extra $3,000 in unemployment.'' 
 Despite or maybe because of its gritty infrastructure -- which included an auditorium with 13-foot ceilings and four obstructive columns, a coal heating system and, in some cases, buckets instead of toilets -- the funky space quickly became a success. 
 Once when Ms. Finley was reading her father's suicide note, the theater's new oil heating system began to groan, and she stormed off the stage. Ms. Finley later recalled the moment as cathartic.
 In the 1990's, after the National Endowment for the Arts clamped down on its grants, Ron Athey did a number of performances in which he covered himself in H.I.V.-positive blood.
 ''I would have TV crews coming down there, saying, 'We want to see Blood Boy,''' Mr. Russell recalled. ''We would have to keep people from hugging him after the performance because the emotional response was so intense.'' 
 For artists, P.S. 122 is more than a performing space, it is a community. ''I remember this profound moment of sitting in a dressing room with Spalding Gray, discussing both having parents that had committed suicide,'' said Ms. Finley, who did some of her first performance pieces in the space. ''I remember seeing Eric Bogosian, and chills went through my spine. And Lou Reed came to see me there. I don't think there was really any other place like it.''
 Still, Mr. Russell said he was ready for a change. ''In some ways, I've done P.S. 122, and I did it as long as I needed to,'' he said. ''I didn't know if I was going to be able to do this when I'm 60 -- you know, 'Wheel him in.' How many times can you watch young women get naked and pour blood on themselves?'' 
 Kenneth B. Lerer, the chairman of the board of the Public Theater, said Mr. Russell had been considered for the director's job there last year. ''Mark was a major candidate until the very end,'' Mr. Lerer said. Ultimately, Oskar Eustis was chosen in November to replace George C. Wolfe. ''We were utterly impressed with him,'' Mr. Lerer added, ''and I plan to get Oskar and Mark together and see if we can get Mark directly involved in an ongoing basis at the Public.'' Mr. Russell and Mr. Eustis had coffee on Thursday, and more discussions about a potential role for Mr. Russell are planned. 
 But wherever he ends up, audiences already know to expect the unexpected. ''The key to a good theater moment is a certain transgression that opens it up,'' Mr. Russell said. ''And that can be anything from Elevator Repair Service or someone taking off their clothes, or someone telling their own story without changing the names, like Spalding. These little fissures open us up into something new.'' 
 Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: A Proposal to End Poverty

 BODY:
It is so easy to sit back in the affluence of our comfortable lives, protected from scourges like malaria and extreme poverty and hunger, and nitpick to death the United Nations' landmark action plan to eradicate poverty and hunger and the plagues they spawn. Indeed, no sooner had the long-awaited report, bearing the stamp of the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, hit the street this week than some economists took shots. ''Utopian central planning by global bureaucrats,'' carped one. 
 There is certainly much to debate about the details of Mr. Sachs's report, which calls for rich countries like the United States to drastically increase foreign aid to poor countries in an effort to halve poverty in its many forms -- hunger, illiteracy, disease -- by 2015. But this is not a time for armchair quarterbacking. The United Nations report is a bold initiative that refuses to accept hunger as the inevitable fate of so many Africans, Latin Americans and Asians. There will be and should be a debate about it as world leaders prepare to meet in September on the antipoverty goals, but it is vital that it not turn into another excuse for inaction. 
 Mr. Sachs's report lays out, in real terms, the myriad ways to help poor people. The beauty of his ideas is in their simplicity: Provide mosquito nets for children who live in malaria-infested regions. Eliminate school and uniform fees to ensure that poor children don't stay home because they can't afford to go to school. Provide farmers in sub-Saharan Africa with soil nutrients to ensure healthier crops. Reform and enforce legislation guaranteeing women and girls property and inheritance rights. 
 None of this is rocket science, although many will try to make it seem so. The strongest, and probably most legitimate, critique of approaches that flood poor countries with money is that many of these poor countries are run by corrupt governments that will stash most of the donor money in private Swiss bank accounts. That has certainly proved true in the past, particularly in Africa, where the poor have stayed poor while a succession of despots have run country after country into the ground.
 But it is counterproductive to make poor people suffer because they have bad governments. Mr. Sachs says now is the time to try the radically different approach of giving bigger amounts of real, quality aid directly to recipients on the ground. That means money to clinics and schools, to build generators and buy medicine and food, instead of the usual low-interest loans to benefit companies back home. 
 The United Nations proposal calls for rich countries to increase their foreign aid to 0.7 percent of G.D.P. by 2015. That's a target that these very same rich countries, flush with good will at the start of the new millennium, set for themselves. In 2002, world leaders, including President Bush, supported a declaration promising to ''make concrete efforts'' toward the 0.7 percent target.
 Three years later, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are already there. The United States remains far behind, at 15 hundredths of 1 percent. So, let's get started, America. The world is waiting.

HEADLINE: Will He Block That Stadium? Speaker Silver Bides His Time

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
''What does Shelly want?''
 It's the question that Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and the Bloomberg administration keep asking at City Hall, in Lower Manhattan and in Albany.
 ''Shelly'' is Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, who stands astride the road as the administration tries to complete its relentless drive to build a $1.4 billion stadium for the Jets, and possibly the 2012 Olympics, on the West Side of Manhattan. Voters may not have a say in whether the stadium gets built -- using $600 million in tax money -- but Mr. Silver will, and his ambivalence is driving other politicians slightly batty. 
 The speaker, however, has a reputation as a horse-trader, and so Mr. Doctoroff and other city officials have been trying to learn what Mr. Silver wants for his downtown Manhattan district in return for his approval when the stadium comes before the little-known Public Authorities Control Board, where the speaker holds veto power. Is it money for affordable housing, something for Chinatown, new funds for the Hudson River Park in TriBeCa? 
 Mr. Silver is not saying, and so far, his relationship with stadium proponents has been chilly. A community leader and two executives involved in rebuilding Lower Manhattan say that the administration is suddenly holding hostage various downtown projects, such as a school for the area's growing population, that had already been agreed on. Gov. George E. Pataki's preliminary budget has not improved the negotiating climate, as it slashes funds for the Second Avenue subway, a project championed by Mr. Silver.
 And so, although Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Wednesday that he hoped the stadium project would be approved at the public authorities board's meeting on Feb. 16, few in the Assembly, the Senate or the governor's office say it will even be on the agenda.
 ''What's the hurry?'' Mr. Silver asked in an interview this week. ''The driving force in this is the Olympics. I don't understand the rush to build a stadium for the 2012 Olympics in 2005.''
 Mr. Silver said he had not made up his mind about the stadium, and had questions about its impact on traffic congestion and the community. He said it was also part of a broader project to redevelop the West Side with office towers, which may compete with efforts he prefers to rebuild the business district in Lower Manhattan at a time when there is a high vacancy rate and no tenants in sight for two buildings at the trade center site.
 Mr. Silver, who has worked to keep downtown's commercial sector vital, has also been philosophically at odds with the Bloomberg administration, which has promoted residential development in the area.
 He said it would be ''unfortunate'' if the mayor were holding up projects he supported in an effort to prod him into voting for the stadium.
 ''If it's true,'' he said, ''it would appear the mayor is more interested in trading, rather than governing; in a physical legacy, instead of governing.''
 He said it appeared that plans for an elementary school in a proposed residential project on Beekman Street were now ''stalled.'' And for three years, he said, he has urged the city to reopen a section of Park Row in front of City Hall. Many people in nearby Chinatown think the street closing has contributed to a severe drop in tourism since 9/11. But, Mr. Silver said, City Hall has not responded.
 Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for Mr. Doctoroff, said the administration would not comment on the specifics of the negotiations.
 Few people on either side of the stadium issue are willing to be quoted by name, because the talks are going on behind closed doors.
 Mr. Silver ''really loathes what Bloomberg is trying to do here,'' said an executive who knows Mr. Silver and is active in Lower Manhattan. 
 ''He's a guy who believes in long-term relationships,'' the executive said. ''They're trying to hold up everything.''
 But stadium advocates say that this is all part of the push and pull of negotiations. ''So long as Shelly gets what he wants downtown,'' said one person involved in promoting the stadium, ''we'll get a stadium.''
 That remains to be seen.
 ''Shelly's genuinely trying to do this on the merits,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. ''The mayor seriously underestimates him if he thinks he can bully him or hold projects hostage.''
 The Bloomberg administration is on something of a roll. Last month, the State Legislature approved the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the Far West Side. On Wednesday, the City Council approved a comprehensive $3 billion rezoning of the 42-block neighborhood. James Whelan, executive director of the Hudson Yards Coalition, left the council meeting saying, ''Two down, one to go.''
 The one to go is the stadium, which the mayor said is critical to the city's future and its bid for the 2012 Olympics.
 The Jets are in tense negotiations with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority over the cost of development rights for building over the West Side rail yards. The authority, which faces fare increases, service cuts and multibillion-dollar shortfalls in its operating budget, wants ''full value'' for the rights, a number that may be far higher than the Jets are willing to pay.
 The team and the Bloomberg administration must also contend with two lawsuits challenging the stadium project. Opponents hope the lawsuits will delay the project from starting until at least July 6, when they contend the International Olympic Committee is likely to pick Paris, not New York, for the 2012 Olympics. The stadium, they say, would then fall by the wayside.
 In the meantime, the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm, is expected to approve the stadium at its meeting on Thursday, reflecting the governor's support for the project. But before the Jets can begin construction, the project must also be approved by the Public Authorities Control Board, whose three members are appointed by Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. The board's decisions must be unanimous, and each member has the right to delay consideration for 30 days.
 Trying to figure out what Mr. Silver will do has become a guessing game for both stadium opponents and supporters.
 Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets, and Jay Cross, the Jets' president, met with Mr. Silver two weeks ago to press their case. They have lined up support from 60 elected officials in New York City, including about 30 Assembly members, in an effort to surround the speaker.
 ''We appreciate that the speaker has kept an open mind about this project,'' said Matt Higgins, a Jets vice president, ''while we work hard to build support in the Legislature.''
 Mayor Bloomberg, who also discussed the stadium with Mr. Silver in Albany recently, wants the public authorities board to approve the stadium on Feb. 16, just before a group from the Olympic Committee arrives in New York to evaluate the city's bid. But Mr. Silver has steadfastly refused to commit.
 Mr. Bruno is also straddling the fence. State officials and the Jets think he will go along if the governor provides $300 million for upstate projects to match the state's support for the stadium in New York City. But that may take until this summer, when, and if, the State Legislature manages to approve a budget.

HEADLINE: Surge in Oil Price Sends Major Indexes Down Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A surge in oil prices sent the major stock indexes to their lowest levels of the year yesterday as investors overlooked a strong earnings report and a bullish outlook from General Electric. All three indexes fell for the third consecutive week.
 Frigid weather in the Northeast and concerns over possible OPEC production cuts pushed crude futures substantially higher. A barrel of light crude settled at $48.53, up $1.22, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Even an 18 percent jump in earnings at General Electric -- a market bellwether because of its varied holdings -- failed to hold investors' attention for long, highlighting the deep concerns on Wall Street since the sell-off began at the start of the year. Oil prices, a weak dollar, concern over interest rates and the Iraqi election have all been cited as potential problems that have kept investors on the sidelines.
 ''I think you're seeing people reacting to things, rather than anticipating things,'' said Paul F. McManus Jr., chief investment strategist at Independence Investments. ''There's a lot of caution out there. I think people are sitting around, waiting for earnings to get past us, before making any kind of moves.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.48 points, or 0.75 percent, to 10,392.99, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 7.54 points, or 0.64 percent, at 1,167.87. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 11.61 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,034.27.
 The last time the major indexes sustained losses for this long was a four-week stretch from late June through late July. The Dow and S.&P. have not started January with three down weeks since 1977.
 Profit taking, concerns over inflation and some high-profile earnings disappointments all contributed to the slump.
 For the week, the Dow fell 1.6 percent, the S.&P. was down 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 2.6 percent.
 Analysts said the week ahead could bring more of the same, with worries about the Iraqi elections, production cuts from OPEC after its Jan. 30 meeting and the Federal Reserve meeting on Feb. 1-2 adding to the mix of uncertainty.
 Consumer confidence fell slightly in January, according to a preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index. The index fell to 95.8, down from December's 97.1 reading and less than Wall Street had expected.
 G.E. remained confident regarding its 2005 earnings. The company, which beat earnings estimates by a penny a share for the quarter, said it expected earnings to grow 10 percent to 15 percent this year. G.E. shares nonetheless slipped 24 cents, to $35.13.
 ''When good news leads to more selling, as opposed to a broad-based rally, that's a sign that the market is really struggling,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke. 
 United Technologies added 30 cents, to $100.08, after beating Wall Street profit forecasts by 2 cents a share. Earnings rose 11 percent for the quarter, and company executives expect them to grow by up to 15 percent in the coming year.
 Earnings were generally good in the financial sector, but Wall Street's reactions were mixed. PNC Financial Services beat Wall Street estimates by 4 cents a share, and KeyCorp surpassed expectations by 8 cents a share after one-time charges. PNC nonetheless tumbled $1.80, to $52.85, while KeyCorp rose 83 cents, to $32.53.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 6/32, to a price of 100 28/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.14 percent from 4.16 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Europe Is Lifting Trade Sanctions on U.S.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The European Union announced on Friday that it was lifting sanctions on American products now that Congress has repealed tax cuts for exporters that were declared illegal by the World Trade Organization.
 Lifting the sanctions also helps improve the atmosphere for President Bush's visit to Europe next month.
 The Europeans couched the announcement as another gesture of good will in their trade relationship with the United States. This month, the two sides backed away from suing each other over the billions of dollars in subsidies that each gives to its biggest civilian aircraft maker. 
 ''We think this is good news,'' said Anthony Gooch, spokesman for the European Union delegation to the United States. ''We hope to get this dispute out of the way, put it to bed and turn off the light.''
 The tariffs on $4 billion of American goods were imposed by Europe a year ago and covered more than 1,500 products from steel to clothing. Mr. Gooch said the sanctions would be lifted retroactively from Jan. 1.
 The European announcement on Friday followed intense debate among the member states of the union, with some countries insisting that the sanctions be kept in place until the United States removed several provisions in a new corporate tax bill passed in October to make it conform more closely to the W.T.O. judgment. 
 Those provisions allow some industries to continue benefiting from the subsidy system, known as the Foreign Sales Corporation, for up to three years as a transition. Other provisions allow some corporations to keep the subsidies in contracts that were signed before the new law was enacted. 
 The Europeans have asked the World Trade Organization to decide the issue. Negotiations between Europe and the United States over the next few months could resolve the dispute. But if there is no agreement, a W.T.O. ruling upholding the Europeans' position could lead to a reimposition of sanctions against American goods.
 That is why the administration, joined by Democratic lawmakers, said Friday that it was not satisfied with Friday's announcement. Both the administration and Democratic lawmakers want the Europeans to drop the complaint before the W.T.O.
 ''After years of hard work and close consultation with the European Commission, Congress fully addressed the E.U.'s major concerns,'' said Richard Mills, the spokesman for the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick. ''It is harmful for the E.U. to needlessly prolong this matter in the face of Congress's good-faith action.''
 In October, Congress approved a corporate tax bill that did away with the narrow $5 billion export subsidy that the W.T.O. had declared illegal. But the measure, three years in the making, included $137 billion in new tax giveaways to companies ranging from Hewlett-Packard and Boeing to an array of oil and gas producers, shopping mall developers and even restaurants. It was one of the most heavily lobbied pieces of legislation in several decades.
 But Pascal Lamy, then the chief trade negotiator for the union, repeatedly told American lawmakers that the bill fell short of satisfying the Europeans if it contained the transition and grandfather clauses. 
 Lawmakers from both parties now say that the Europeans are being unreasonable.
 ''Democrats have always advocated a reasonable transition to preserve American jobs while complying with W.T.O. rulings,'' said Dan Maffei, spokesman for the Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee.
 More troublesome, the dispute over the tax subsidy is entwined in the larger trans-Atlantic disagreement over government subsidies to Boeing and Airbus.
 The Europeans have complained that the long transition periods in the new corporate tax law helped Boeing just as the United States was filing suit against Europe for the government subsidies it gives Airbus, its giant passenger airline company.
 Mr. Mills, the spokesman for the United States trade representative, has said throughout the discussions that this is not the case and that the Europeans should pause before linking the two trade cases. He said global trading rules prohibit using one trade case to influence another.
 For his part, Mr. Gooch, the E.U. spokesman, said that lifting the sanctions was a major achievement given disagreements within the union.
 ''Our intention is to work well with the U.S. side,'' Mr. Gooch said. ''They knew that we had strong concerns about the transitions throughout the process.''

An article in Business Day on Saturday about the European Union's removal of sanctions on American products now that Congress has repealed tax cuts for exporters referred incorrectly to the transition period in which some American industries will continue benefiting from an export subsidy. It is two years, not three.

HEADLINE: Euro Disney to Raise Cash With Low-Priced Stock Offer

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Euro Disney, seeking to complete a refinancing of its troubled theme parks, said Friday that it would raise 253 million euros, or $328 million, by selling shares at 0.09 euro each, or 11.7 cents. 
 The extraordinarily low price for the shares, seemingly intended to assure that the offering would be completed, sent the price of existing shares down 0.04 euro, to 0.22 euro. The shares are down more than 99 percent from their peak in 1992, shortly before the opening of Disneyland Paris, the first of the company's two theme parks east of Paris. 
 The rights offering is the final part of Euro Disney's second financial restructuring. Under it, the United States parent, the Walt Disney Company, will buy 1.11 billion new shares. A company controlled by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia will buy 217.3 million shares. The purchases will enable each to maintain its percentage holdings in Euro Disney.
 The prince, who gained a reputation for financial acumen by investing in Citicorp, a predecessor of the current Citigroup, when that stock was depressed in 1991, helped complete the first Euro Disney restructuring in 1994 by purchasing shares at the French franc equivalent of 1.52 euros.
 The 1994 restructuring essentially put off obligations for 10 years, hoping that by then growth in the business and inflation would have solved the financial problems. That did not happen, leading to the second restructuring.
 The new restructuring involved putting off payments to the parent company for many years. But those payments would still be owed, and that has helped to hold the share price down.
 In an interview, the chief financial officer of Euro Disney, Jeffrey Speed, said the rights offering ''will give us the liquidity and the capital we need for new attractions.'' Noting that Disneyland is less than 13 years old, he said theme parks in Europe were ''a relatively immature business'' with room to grow.
 In 1992, admission to Disneyland cost the equivalent of about 34 euros, or less than the cost of two shares. Now, a one-day ticket for either Disneyland or the newer Walt Disney Studios park is 40 euros and it would cost the value of 444 shares in the rights offering to get into one of the parks for one day.
 Existing shareholders will receive 13 rights to buy new shares for each 5 shares now held. That would increase the number of shares outstanding to 3.9 billion from the current 1.1 billion. 
 The part of the offering not subscribed by Walt Disney and the Saudi prince is to be underwritten by five financial institutions, although Mr. Speed said they had the standard right to back out of the commitment because of adverse market conditions.
 There has been speculation that the company would do a reverse stock split to raise its per share price, which is now the lowest of any company in the CAC Mid 100 index. But such splits are complicated under French law and such a move could lead to a decline in the price after the split is completed. Mr. Speed said a split was ''not currently in the plan.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about a plan by Euro Disney to raise cash through a stock offering misstated the stake proposed for a company controlled by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia. A planned purchase of 217.3 million shares will leave the prince's company with a 10 percent stake in Euro Disney, less than its current holding of more than 16 percent; the purchase will not enable his company to maintain its current ownership percentage. The article also misstated the number of financial institutions underwriting the part of the offering to which Walt Disney and the Saudi prince are not subscribing; it is six, not five.

HEADLINE: Pentagon's Needs Offer Airlines a Lift

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
At the slowest time of the year for the nation's struggling airlines, one big customer, the Pentagon, wants to give them more business.
 According to a government memorandum circulated this week, the Pentagon has increased its spending by 15 percent so far this year on flights by passenger airlines, with the heaviest traffic expected in February and March.
 The memo also said that the two dozen airlines, charter companies and cargo carriers that participate in a program, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, may also be given the opportunity to fly goods and troops to countries in South Asia that were ravaged by the tsunami, supplementing a relief effort by the military.
 The memo, dated Jan. 14, summarized a teleconference involving military officials and participants in the air fleet. 
 In 2005, the government is ''buying at a pace about 15 percent above'' what it was spending last year, according to the memo. It estimated spending of $315 million on flights during the first quarter of 2005, compared with the $275 million spent in the first quarter last year.
 The memo gave no reason for the increase, but it coincides with the third rotation of troops to Iraq since the conflict began nearly two years ago. A spokesman at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, where the program is based, had no immediate comment. 
 According to the memo, the Pentagon wants to contract with the airlines to fly 71,600 passengers in February, and 75,300 in March. The transporting of passengers and equipment drops off significantly after that: in April, the air fleet is scheduled to carry 18,200 passengers, and 10,400 passengers in May. In addition, the commercial carriers are supplying one daily flight of 250 military personnel bound for rest and relaxation.
 Under military regulations, the commercial carriers do not remain at the bases after landing but immediately depart after unloading. The airlines and cargo carriers supply flight crews.
 During the initial deployment in Iraq in 2003, the air fleet program served as a lifeline to airlines as they struggled with a weak economy, the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus on air travel and the reluctance of travelers to fly.
 The government paid $636.2 million to 10 airlines that flew troops to the Middle East during the 131-day mobilization, and another $574 million to 14 cargo carriers to deliver equipment. 
 All major passenger airlines have participated in the air fleet, although the amount of business each handles varies widely. ATA Airlines has received the most passenger business, while two charter carriers, Omni International and World Airways International, transport both troops and equipment.
 ATA filed for bankruptcy protection in October, and reached an agreement last month to sell some assets to Southwest Airlines. Even so, the airline said it planned to keep participating in the military program. 
 The Pentagon's plans for greater use of the air fleet coincide with efforts by the major airlines to reduce their flights inside the United States and expand international flights. The carriers have been involved in a fare war at home, set off by Delta Air Lines' decision to cut ticket prices by 50 percent and place limits on what it charges for air fares.
 In theory, that might limit the number of planes available to the air fleet, since the airlines might prefer to fill them with civilian passengers. But one person involved with the program at a major airline said he thought the government would be able to persuade carriers to bid.
 For one thing, airlines will receive slightly more than they received during the early part of the Iraq conflict, when they were paid 8.5 cents per seat mile to transport troops on their biggest planes. 
 According to government data, the airlines this year will receive 9.149 cents per seat mile for flights involving the biggest jets in the program, like the Boeing 747 and the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10. 
 The memo said the Pentagon hoped members of the air fleet would soon be able to bid for flights under Operation Unified Assistance, which is sending relief to countries ravaged by the December tsunami. ''We hope to soon relieve most of these gray tails and start sending more missions'' to commercial participants, the memo said.
 Through Jan. 4, military planes based at Scott Air Force Base had transported 1.6 million pounds of cargo and 748 passengers to areas affected by the tsunami, according to a military newsletter posted on the base's Web site. The flights are primarily using Kadena Air Base in Japan as a positioning center.

HEADLINE: Agent for Saddam Hussein Met With Carter and Kemp

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS and DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
An Iraqi-American businessman who pleaded guilty this week to secretly lobbying influential Americans on behalf of Saddam Hussein pursued contacts with Democrats like former President Jimmy Carter and Republicans like Jack Kemp, the former vice presidential candidate, government officials said Friday.
 The businessman, Samir A. Vincent, is now cooperating with a federal investigation into corruption in the United Nations oil-for-food aid program for Iraq. He pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges that he had pocketed millions in hidden oil profits in exchange for helping the Iraqi government in its efforts to end economic sanctions imposed in 1990.
 Mr. Kemp said in a statement on Friday that he had met with Mr. Vincent first in about 1997 to discuss the American position on sanctions. He described the essence of the conversations by saying that Mr. Vincent had told him he was motivated ''by the national security of the United States and thought the Iraqi government believed the sanctions would never be lifted, which he said he believed was leading them to obstruct inspectors from coming into the country.'' 
 Mr. Kemp said he agreed that sanctions might be lifted but only in exchange for an unconditional guarantee of unlimited and surprise inspections for unconventional weapons. 
 Mr. Kemp said he had had no dealings with Mr. Vincent on any other matters and received nothing in return for any discussions he had had with government officials about Iraq sanctions. 
 Former President Carter said through a spokeswoman in Atlanta that his only involvement with Mr. Vincent was in receiving him, along with three Iraqi clerics, at his home in Plains, Ga., in September 1999. The spokeswoman, Deanna Congileo, said the purpose was ''to hear their views on the plight of children in Iraq and the impact of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.'' Before the visit, Mr. Carter had long been on the record as opposing sanctions against Iraq. 
 The contact with Mr. Kemp was reported by Newsweek on its Web site this week. The New York Sun reported Mr. Vincent's contact with former President Carter in its Friday editions. 
 Mr. Vincent's practice of lobbying officials on behalf of Iraq was referred to in one of the government's charges, but the people he met were not identified. That was in keeping with what officials said was the Justice Department's policy of withholding the names of people who are involved in a matter under investigation but not suspected of wrongdoing. Mr. Vincent has told prosecutors that he met with a number of other prominent Americans in his effort to enlist their help in getting sanctions lifted, the officials said. However, several of those officials, contacted on Friday by a reporter, said they had never met him. So far, prosecutors do not believe that any former American officials engaged in wrongdoing, the officials said.
 The charges against Mr. Vincent said that he had lobbied ''former officials of the United States government who maintained close contacts to high-ranking members of both the Clinton and Bush administrations in an effort to convince the U.S. government to support the repeal of sanctions against Iraq.''
 Mr. Vincent's lobbying efforts between 1997 and 2001 were repaid with millions of dollars worth of allocations under the United Nations oil-for-food aid program. The program was intended to permit Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil on condition that the proceeds be used only for purchases of food and other necessities. 
 Mr. Vincent's lawyer, Robert A. Litt, said he would not discuss the case.
 The officials said the case involving Mr. Vincent was the beginning of a rapidly widening American criminal inquiry into the Iraq aid program, which is also being investigated by a panel appointed by the United Nations. 
 The criminal inquiry, being conducted by prosecutors in New York, has included efforts to determine whether United Nations officials were aware of Mr. Vincent's activities, the government officials said. If there is any finding of wrongdoing by United Nations officials, it is unclear whether prosecutors could bring charges, because many high-level officeholders at the world body have diplomatic status immunizing them from prosecution under American law.

HEADLINE: Powell to Step Down at F.C.C. After Pushing for Deregulation

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Michael K. Powell, who has overseen the Federal Communications Commission during a time of helter-skelter convergence among telephone, television and high-speed Internet services, announced Friday that he would be stepping down from the agency in two months. 
 Mr. Powell sought to roll back regulation of each of those industries. But on his watch the F.C.C. also enforced stringent decency standards, imposing hefty fines on television and radio broadcasters. 
 Administration officials and industry executives said that two leading contenders had emerged to succeed Mr. Powell as chairman. One is Kevin J. Martin, a Republican commissioner and former White House official who several times foiled Mr. Powell's attempts to deregulate broadcasters and telephone companies. The other is Becky A. Klein, a senior policy adviser to George W. Bush when he was governor of Texas and a former chairwoman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. She lost a Congressional bid two months ago. Her campaign received a large amount of financial support from executives at telecommunications companies who expected she would be a top contender for the F.C.C. job. 
 Both Mr. Martin and Ms. Klein have close ties to Mr. Bush and they have track records that are less ideological than Mr. Powell's. Both have taken steps as regulators that at times have angered the large Bell companies and at other times pleased them. Working in Mr. Martin's favor is the fact that he is a sitting commissioner and, as such, could fill the position quickly because he would not need Senate confirmation. Some broadcasters are concerned, however, that Mr. Martin could be even more aggressive than Mr. Powell in enforcing the indecency rules. 
 The officials and executives said that other candidates being considered to succeed Mr. Powell include Michael D. Gallagher, the top Commerce Department official on telecommunications issues; Pat Wood III, another former Texas regulator who is head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and Janice Obuchowski, a consultant who worked in the Commerce Department during the administration of the first President Bush.
 The White House is also expected to soon have a second Republican vacancy on the five-member commission. Kathleen Q. Abernathy, an ally of Mr. Powell, has recently told administration officials that she intends to step down.
 Mr. Powell, 41, who became chairman four years ago this week after serving the prior three years as a commissioner, has told friends that he will take time off after he leaves the F.C.C. to consider his next career move. His announcement has long been expected although the way his resignation was initially disclosed -- in an editorial on Friday in The Wall Street Journal -- was unusual.
 ''Having completed a bold and aggressive agenda, it is time for me to pursue other opportunities and let someone else take the reins of the agency,'' he said in his statement. ''The seeds of our policies are taking firm root in the marketplace and are starting to blossom.''
 Mr. Powell, the son of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is also leaving his post, declined to discuss his decision. 
 His successor faces a number of difficult challenges. The commission has to decide how it will regulate the newly emerging telephone services being offered over the Internet. 
 It also faces significant issues on the transition to digital television and on overhauling the multibillion-dollar universal service fund that provides telephone and Internet services to rural areas, schools and libraries. And it has not announced how it will respond to the decision in June by a federal appeals court casting doubt on the commission's attempt to allow media conglomerates to own more television, radio and newspaper properties. 
 ''There is a large agenda of unfinished business,'' said Blair Levin, a former top official at the commission during the Clinton administration who is now a senior regulatory analyst at Legg Mason, the financial services company. ''Powell leaves a very mixed record.''
 When he was appointed, Mr. Powell vowed to erase scores of regulations -- from those restricting the size of media companies to those setting wholesale phone rates. He also promised to consider relaxing the tough indecency rules restricting television and radio broadcasters. Those positions earned him significant support among the largest telephone and broadcasting companies.
 Although he was fortunate enough politically to be able to work with both a Republican White House and a Republican Congress, industry executives and analysts said he nonetheless fell short of his agenda. His efforts at deregulating the media ownership rules were blocked by the appeals court. His attempt to revamp the phone-rate rules failed initially after Mr. Martin broke ranks with him. After an appeals court struck down the rules, the commission rewrote them and they are once again being challenged in court. 
 He also sharply shifted emphasis on broadcasting regulations and indecency. As a commissioner, and early in his tenure as chairman, he was praised by companies and First Amendment organizations for saying it was time to eliminate the double standard that allowed the government to subject broadcasters, unlike cable and satellite television, to indecency and other speech regulations. 
 But under pressure from lawmakers and some conservative organizations, he wound up leading the agency through one of its most aggressive enforcement periods and expanded the indecency rules. His shift became apparent about a year ago, after the House and Senate adopted resolutions critical of an F.C.C. staff conclusion that Bono, the lead singer of U2, did not violate indecency rules by uttering an expletive after winning a Golden Globe Award on NBC; the commission later overruled its staff.
 Mr. Powell has said the broadcasters have lowered their standards in a quest for higher ratings. But industry lawyers say the broader interpretation of the rules has had the effect of chilling legitimate speech.
 Consumer groups praised Mr. Powell for two regulatory changes. The first, done with the Federal Trade Commission, set up a ''do not call'' registry that restricts telephone solicitations. The second fostered competition among mobile phone companies by permitting customers to retain their phone numbers when changing providers. 
 But the groups also sharply criticized Mr. Powell for a variety of other policies that they said led to higher prices and reduced competition. They said his policies had the effect of introducing some competition for services being sought by wealthier consumers, like high-speed Internet service, while neglecting the needs of the less affluent.
 ''During his tenure, cable rates have risen almost three times faster than inflation, satellite prices are beginning to similarly rise, broadband prices have increased and there has been enormous consolidation in the wire line and wireless services,'' said Gene Kimmelman, a senior director of public policy at Consumers Union. ''Powell was more concerned about preserving competition for wealthy people, people who already have broadband, people who have video service. The people who used to rely on the long-distance companies, who want more choices for their cellphone carrier, they were left out in the cold.''
 It was a sign of the contentious, and, to some, disappointing nature of his tenure that Mr. Powell received as much praise as criticism on Friday from various industry leaders.
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who fought to reverse the commission's decision to relax the media ownership rules, said, ''I wish him the best in the future and look forward to working with his successor, who I hope will see things a little differently on the need for localism and diversified ownership of broadcasting stations.''
 Richard E. Wiley, a commission chairman in the 1970's and a telecommunications lawyer with Wiley Rein & Fielding, said Mr. Powell ''was a strong, visionary leader.''
 ''I've watched them all come and go and I think he has been one of the better ones we've seen, particularly in understanding the technological issues,'' Mr. Wiley said.
 Others were not as laudatory. ''It actually gives us hope that there can actually be a new agenda at the helm of the F.C.C.,'' Jeff Zucker, president of the NBC Universal Television Group, said in answering a question at a gathering of television critics in Los Angeles. ''I think it's a real opportunity, quite frankly.''
 The Parents Television Council, an advocacy organization that has lobbied hard for more stringent indecency rulings, was equally critical, saying the F.C.C. could have gone further during Mr. Powell's tenure. ''While we acknowledge and respect his many years of service to the nation in a number of capacities, Michael Powell has brought us four years of failed leadership at the F.C.C.,'' said L. Brent Bozell, president of the council. 
 Officials have said that the commission has traced virtually all of the complaints received over the last two years -- with the exception of those involving last year's Super Bowl halftime show featuring Janet Jackson -- to the parents' council.

HEADLINE: Bush's Smiles Meet Some Frowns in Europe

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
The start of President Bush's second term has been marked by conciliatory gestures toward Europe: a promised visit to the headquarters of the European Union, the selection of a top State Department team deeply versed in European affairs, restraint on trade, cooperation on the Ukrainian crisis and bold commitments to the active Middle Eastern diplomacy that Europeans want.
 All of this amounts to a presidential gamble that the Atlantic community is alive and well, despite the divisive trauma of Iraq. But Mr. Bush will want results. As his secretary of state-designate, Condoleezza Rice, said this week: ''When judging a course of action, I will never forget that the true measure of its worth is whether it is effective.''
 By this yardstick, can European-American cooperation still deliver? Can it usher in the freer world to which the president is committed? Promising to listen to the counsel of allies, Mr. Bush declared Thursday, ''The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is the prelude to our enemies' defeat.'' 
 The initial reaction was generally cool. European commentators asked what new war Mr. Bush might embark on in the name of his idealism, and portrayed his global bid to eliminate tyranny as hubris or hypocrisy. But a few newspapers, like the conservative German daily Die Welt, suggested, ''A little bit of this spirit would do the Old World good and help it to renew itself.''
 Pressing tests of cooperation abound: the Iraq war, a Middle East changed by Yasir Arafat's death, the slow-building potential missile crisis in Iran, Ukraine's democratic transition.
 ''The president has demonstrated his willingness to re-engage with the Europeans -- all of them, not one at a time, and that includes the French,'' said Simon Serfaty of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''This is critical. But achieving tangible results will not be easy because basic positions have not changed.''
 The French, although they have tried not to trumpet the fact, feel vindicated by the morass in Iraq -- the result, in their view, of a war fought on flimsy grounds with inadequate means in a bad neighborhood they know well from bitter colonial history.
 The Bush administration, by contrast, feels vindicated by what it sees as a significant democratic tide set in motion by a war on terror that has assumed aspects of a war on tyranny.
 The Palestinian election on Jan. 9, the Iraqi election planned for Jan. 30, even the overturning of a fraudulent election in Ukraine -- all of these events are seen as the fruits of the ''transformational diplomacy'' Ms. Rice embraces, one directed at the spread of freedom and democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere.
 Such differences of perception will be reinforced by deep-rooted forces that now push Europe and the United States in opposite directions.
 The most important of these is the fact that, with much of their sovereignty ceded to the European Union, the countries of Europe are post-nationalist states, troubled by military assertiveness and the bold projection of national power.
 Wolfgang Ischinger, the German ambassador to the United States, said fighting for freedom was fine, but the question was how. ''The push for liberty has to come from within,'' he said, referring to societies America might want to change. He added that if the president's ambitions mean ''going out and being a missionary, Europeans may not want to buy into that.''
 Against this backdrop, the potential for renewed discord persists. Differences may erupt over the speed of an American military withdrawal from Iraq that many in Europe would like completed by the end of the year.
 Where Europeans see dead Palestinians, Americans tend to see terrorized Israelis; as a result, coordinated pressure on the two parties will be elusive.
 The administration may tire of European diplomacy in Iran if it is convinced that Tehran is close to acquiring a nuclear weapon under a secret program whose reality the Europeans have missed.
 Still, a real determination seems to exist for the moment to mend the worst trans-Atlantic crisis in many years. The National Security Council has even begun weekly meetings with senior European officials like Mr. Ischinger; the talks, intended to promote a new dialogue, have been welcomed by Europeans.
 ''We don't want to give lessons and we have no desire to look in the rear-view mirror,'' Michel Barnier, the French foreign minister, said in an interview this month. ''The alliance between Americans and Europeans must be balanced and effective.''
 In what a senior American official in Europe called ''a symbolic event to bring us together,'' Mr. Bush will go to Brussels on Feb. 22, visiting NATO and the 25-member European Union. His speeches are expected to include not only a powerful endorsement of the alliance but also of the idea of a united Europe.
 The European Union often felt slighted during the first Bush term, which was marked more by talk of ''coalitions of the willing'' and of ''old'' and ''new'' Europe than of the promise of the continent's integration. It was not only in Paris that a view gained ground that America now saw its interest more in a divided than in a united Europe.
 Mr. Bush, the senior official said, will seek to dispel this notion. He is likely to underscore the joint effectiveness and interest of the United States and Europe in spreading democratic market economies. Another potential theme is their shared commitment to a two-state solution in the Middle East, an outcome on which Ms. Rice has said she will expend ''an enormous amount of effort.''
 At the heart of Mr. Bush's new policy in Europe lies a push to reconcile with Germany, a firm postwar ally that opposed the Iraq war.
 From Brussels, the president will travel to Mainz, Germany, for meetings that Ezra Suleiman, an expert on European affairs at Princeton University, said ''has focused French minds on the fact that they risk being sidelined and marginalized if they don't get over the Iraq row.''
 A rapprochement with Germany comes naturally to Ms. Rice and her selected deputy, Robert B. Zoellick, both of whom were involved in the country's unification in 1990, an example of transformational diplomacy that left a lasting impression on the incoming secretary of state. The likely No.3 at the State Department, R. Nicholas Burns, who is now ambassador to NATO, is also a committed Atlanticist.
 ''We see old European hands coagulating at the top of the State Department,'' said Jonathan Eyal, a British foreign policy expert. ''We see a secretary of state with the ear of the president, we see the president coming to Brussels and deferring for now to European diplomatic efforts in Iran, and we see a quest for quiet mediation in the Airbus-Boeing dispute. All of that seems to amount to an opportunity we must grab.''
 But Europe, of late, has been characterized as much by division as unity, and hostility to Mr. Bush remains virulent in many countries.
 An influential current in European thought sees the European Union more as a counterweight to the United States than as a partner. Where Poland and Slovakia embrace America, France and Spain wonder. The Continent is at best ambivalent about American power, at least as it has been exercised under Mr. Bush.
 If such divisive forces prevail and Mr. Bush's overtures prove sterile, Ms. Rice may find herself quickly outflanked by others in the administration, not least Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, whose views of Europe, or at least European unity and traditional alliances, are far more skeptical.

JACK FISH
By J. Milligan.
217 pp. Soho Press. $23.
 CONSIDER the similarities between fish and hit men. They are both coldblooded. They have names like Hammerhead and Dead-Eye. They are sociopaths with links to highly organized networks. They are incapable of meaningful hugging. They are often killed in restaurants.
 I'm not trying to make your next dip in the ocean terrifying. I'm simply trying to provide some context for an odd but juicy new novel called ''Jack Fish.'' A comedic noir, it's the story of an assassin named Jack Fish who must track down an architect in New York City named Victor Sargasso and kill him. The only thing is, Jack has just walked out of the ocean -- though human, he lives underwater, in Atlantis -- and he's having immense difficulties breathing up here in the Topworld. Oh, there's another thing, too -- all Jack is wearing is a ''tiny blue mankini.'' 
 You could call this book a fish-out-of-water story, but it is more accurately described as a fishlike-man-out-of-water story. Moving from Brooklyn diner to Midtown architecture firm to New Jersey theme park, the novel has the stealthy and web-toed Jack tangling with New York demimondaines and corporate wonks as he dodges a violent gang called the Maltese. The book brims throughout with hyperspecific detail and hipster patois; it's like a Mark Leyner novel, but with a plot, and harpoons.
 Come with me now to Page 22, to the primer gray Econoline 250 passenger van in which Jack and a fellow operative named Dick are barreling down the road, fleeing harpoon-throwing Maltese and hurrying Sargasso-ward. As if it weren't distracting enough that Dick, the van's owner, has decoupaged the entirety of the vehicle's interior with photos of famous Dicks ranging from Van Dyke to Butkus to Nixon to Van Patten, Jack is still intensely landsick. All his saliva has ''wicked through his cheeks'' and disappeared, and his tongue has ''fused to his palate and stuck there.'' Ever-helpful Dick proffers a bottle of Gatorade, its flavor Fierce Melon. Jack takes a ''long pull through the Sport Top'' and then lets out ''a satisfied, 'Aaah!' before remarking, 'Fierce Melon! In the DickVan!' ''
 If your idea of fun does not, as mine does, have room for rhapsodies like ''Fierce Melon! In the DickVan!'' then this may not be the book for you. I was, uh, fairly hooked. That said, my attention did flag midway through when, despite the acuity of detail and the virtuosity of imagination on display, it became clear that the relationships between the characters weren't growing much and the protagonist wasn't changing. But by the end, J. Milligan had won back my admiration because he is such a terrific observer of New York City. Here are Lower East Side streets ''viscous in struggle and trade and rotting garbage''; here is Brighton Beach, ''where the el tracks kept the street in permanent zebra shadow.'' There's a lovely passage, set in a municipal pool building hung with W.P.A. murals, in which Milligan contrasts the sturdy, hard-working figures in the murals (''workers who made . . . big, true things like boilers and smelters'') with the boho dancers at a party down below (who make ''things like PowerPoint presentations and intranets and 'solutions' to nonexistent problems'').
 With an imagination this rich, what will Milligan do next? This is his first novel. Previously -- and, as we say on the F train, ya gotta love it -- he was the co-author of the memoir of the actor who plays Big Bird on ''Sesame Street.'' Recent literary history would suggest first novels that are comedy-laced noirs featuring talking animals can augur huge acclaim and success for their authors: Jonathan Lethem put animal characters like a kangaroo gangster in ''Gun, With Occasional Music,'' and later became one of the voices of his generation; Eric Garcia's dinosaur-filled ''Anonymous Rex'' has spawned a trilogy, and one of Garcia's non-dinosaur books, ''Matchstick Men,'' became a Nicolas Cage movie. So, in Milligan's case, I'm thinking: Big Bird . . . Jack Fish . . . congratulatory phone call from Stockholm?
 Let it be so. Linus Pauling in the DickVan!

HEADLINE: Teenagers Get a Taste of 'The Apprentice'

BYLINE: By STACY ALBIN

 BODY:
JAMEL THOMAS, 17, of Freeport, had 30 minutes to figure out how to attract more customers to a make-believe men's clothing store. The role-playing scenario was one part of a regional contest, held on Jan. 12 and sponsored by DECA, the national program that teaches marketing and business skills to high school students.
 In the annual competition, 800 or so students from schools in Nassau County participated in the regional battle at the Nassau Coliseum, where they showed off what they had learned in business classes and any relevant real-life experience. 
 To participate in the competition, students had to have taken at least one business education class and be a member of DECA through one of the school chapters. Because of the large number of students who wanted to participate, some schools held runoff competitions to decide who would go to the regionals. 
 There, the students worked individually or in teams of two to address one of 23 different problems, described in handouts distributed on the day of the contest. To prepare, each team or individual read the scenario and formulated a plan of action. After their half hour was up, the participants then had 10 minutes to present their ideas to two judges, who asked questions and then scored the presentation based on the students' oral skills, knowledge of terminology and understanding of marketing and business principles.
 The judges covered a wide range of occupations, everyone from lawyers to public relations specialists to real estate agents. One celebrity judge was George Ross, senior legal counsel and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, who can be seen on television on ''The Apprentice.'' 
 In addition to the oral presentations, students also had to take a written exam: 100 multiple-choice questions about marketing, economics and management. Based on their combined scores on the written test and the presentation, the top 184 students will go on to the semifinals, to be held in Rochester on March 9-11. From there, the winners will then advance to the finals in Anaheim, Calif., on April 27, where they will compete for corporate scholarships of $1,000 to $10,000. 
 For his part, Mr. Thomas, who was assigned to work alone, drew on his after-school job as a sales associate at the French Connection, a clothing store in Roosevelt Field. Faced with the contest problem of luring more shoppers, he proposed doing what the managers would do at work: frequently changing the front display window. 
 ''It's catching,'' said Mr. Thomas, a student at Freeport High School. ''I'm even thinking about changing the lighting outside the store.'' 
 DECA, which started life as the Distributive Education Clubs of America, was formed in 1946 to improve educational and career opportunities in marketing and management for high school students. Long Island is a DECA stronghold with 3,400 student members and 21 chapters in Nassau County and 34 in Suffolk. New York State has 6,000 members, and there are some 160,000 members nationally.
 In simple terms, the chapters provide students with an opportunity to role-play as managers and business executives outside the classroom. But the classroom is where the students learn the basics -- how to prepare a budget for a business, for example -- and address more complicated issues like corporate responsibility.
 The classes provide hands-on experience in how to run a business and how to make business-related decisions, said Mary Peres, a teacher at Oceanside High School and a principal organizer of DECA's regional and semifinal competitions.
 At Oceanside High, for instance, students who enroll in a class called DECA Leadership act as management trainees -- in the classroom -- for a company of their own choosing. In written reports and oral presentations, they work on a budget and identify the company's target customers and how best to advertise. They also write news releases and create slogans and advertising campaigns.
 Howard Mizel, 15, said he and his friends Matthew Ross Coleman and Jill Katz, picked the Home Depot for their project. One challenge, he said, was figuring out all the various advertising mediums and whether advertising in each would be worthwhile. ''When you look at a bulletin board, I never realized how much goes into it,'' he added. 
 Ms. Peres, who has been a DECA adviser for 25 years, said the class provided students with ''a reality education so that they're not just reading a textbook.''
 The regional, state and national contests attempt to hone students' skills by calling upon their problem-solving abilities and requiring them to think quickly and creatively, she said. Mr. Ross, the Trump executive, said it made good sense for teenagers to develop some business acumen. ''I think as a culture we've become so enamored with becoming a professional, we've overlooked the reality and creativity of being an entrepreneur,'' he said.
 The hypothetical situations at the regional contest were devised to touch upon various industries and issues. One, for instance, put the students in charge of publicity for a state's tourism bureau and asked them to write a news release meant to reassure the public that a tourist area was still safe after a rash of fires. Another scenario asked students to persuade their bosses to relieve them of some of their recently added management responsibilities.
 Other events focused on the fast-food industry, e-commerce and financial analysis. ''Dressing up, talking, presenting themselves and ideas to adults, this is what they learn regardless of the topic,'' said Gigi Michaels, who served as a judge. She is a retired guidance counselor and business teacher for Farmingdale High School. 
 At the contest students were required to dress up -- shirts and ties for the boys and skirts for the girls -- or they could wear tailored slacks and DECA's officially sanctioned navy blazer with the club insignia on the pocket. Cellphones and laptop computers were prohibited, unless they were part of a particular situation. Although there are no official rules about chewing gun, Ms. Peres said teachers should tell their students not to -- the rules were there to teach students how to be professional, she said. 
 Students have their own reasons for becoming involved. Some said they signed up for a marketing class because there were no regular exams and the curriculum was more colorful than, say, computer science. Others said that these classes, which often require oral presentations, helped them overcome their shyness and nervousness in speaking publicly.
 ''It's totally different than a structured class,'' said Nicole Wolosoff, a senior at Oceanside High School. She described herself as a ''very creative, hands-on person who doesn't like taking tests,'' and the DECA Leadership class fit that mold. ''I really like it,'' she added. 
 Mr. Coleman, 15, a sophomore at Oceanside High, said he wanted to become a surgeon, not a businessman. But by studying marketing, he was learning how to communicate effectively, which would be important in job interviews, he said.
 He wanted to advance in the DECA competition because his sister Lindsay, now 22, placed third in the nationals when she was in high school. ''Ever since then,'' he said, ''I've been excited to go and beat her.''

HEADLINE: For Brokers, Cleaning Up Is Part of the Job

BYLINE: By Anna Bahney

 BODY:
In the competitive sport of residential real estate in New York City, the arrival of end-of-the-year bonuses on Wall Street is like the long awaited day when pitchers and catchers show up for spring training: HOPE at the beginning of another season.
 Rather than PREPARING for the summer real estate season typical in the suburbs and much of the rest of the country, New York follows the money. While there is no real ''slow'' time in real estate in the city any more, inventory tends to BUILD at this time of year, making the period from January to April showtime. 
 With the bonus money circulating, interest rates holding relatively steady and the supply of apartments only slightly more than it was at this time last year, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, it should be another busy season.
 Ethan Woods, an AGENT for Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, wants the apartment of his client Melissa Radin to be toned and fit for the NEW SEASON. Like a personal trainer, he is coaching, encouraging and instructing Mrs. Radin on CLEANING, updating and de-cluttering her two-bedroom condo in preparation for it to be a real million-dollar baby and bona fide contender. 
 Mr. Woods is pushing Mrs. Radin to be ready in the next couple of months, although she doesn't think she will be ready until the summer. ''Bonuses have come in," Mr. Woods reminded her. ''People are itching to buy now. February is good, March is O.K. But after that, people begin looking at spending their money on their summer -- the Hamptons or their vacation.''
 Walking through Mrs. Radin's apartment in the St. Tropez building at 64th Street and First Avenue, where she lives with her husband, Michael, and their two young sons, Mr. Woods also points out that she has the best chance to make the most money during the first two to three weeks it is on the market, after which, he said, properties become stale. He stops and points at a yellow, brown and green equine painting propped against the wall on top of a bulky bookshelf: ''But nothing is going to happen unless you get rid of that horse.'' 
 He's tough, but Mrs. Radin hired him as an agent to be her -- and her apartment's -- domestic fitness guru. Mr. Woods showed the Radins this apartment three years ago and they know he has a track record for training apartments for higher sales. ''I told him to be brutal,'' Mrs. Radin said, ''because I want to get the most that I can out of this apartment,'' adding that she expects to spend about $6,000 (for things like new doors, a bathroom vanity, window treatments and storage for toys and furniture) to perk up the apartment. She bought it three years ago for $830,000 and now hopes to sell it for $1.5 million. 
 Mr. Woods is among a growing number of agents in the city taking a stand against open houses featuring dirty dishes in the sink. If he arrives to show an apartment and sees such a thing, he will remind sellers, ''That is $3,000 sitting in your sink.''
 He and like-minded agents try to find a diplomatic way to tell sellers that Fluffy and Whiskers have a litter box that makes a wall of stink upon entering the apartment. They delicately explain that the acid green walls in the bathroom might make a better first impression if covered in eggshell white paint. These agents have concluded that ''estate sale'' doesn't have to mean an empty, distressed apartment and will hire contractors, rent furniture and even commission architecture plans at their own expense, sometimes spending thousands of dollars. 
 Their mission is to show -- often by rolling up their sleeves and pushing around credenzas -- that a property can get a higher price and spend less time on the market if it is clean and uncluttered. It sounds simple, but with several years of a strong seller's market, brokers are faced with people who do not even pick up their dirty socks, because they're convinced that their apartments will sell themselves. 
 If sellers don't think its worth some effort, they should talk to more buyers.
 Lindsay Hunter and her boyfriend, Chris Guilmet, both actors, have been looking at apartments in Manhattan and Brooklyn since October. ''I think I'm particularly bad at looking past things that I find unattractive on a surface level,'' Ms. Hunter said. ''I hate it when there is a flagrant misuse of space. Like if they can't find a place to put their shoes, how will I? If it is cluttered or unclean it really bothers me.''
 She remembers looking at apartments with dirty dishes in the sink and black dust on the windowsills. One apartment had an old laminate countertop ''the color of tooth decay: a faux marble ivory with odd ribbons of red that made me think of pain.'' She peeked in a shower once, and ''the owner's hair was there in the drain. I felt awful, like I had looked in someone's underwear drawer -- a little too personal.'' 
 ''I'm susceptible to charm,'' Ms. Hunter said. ''If it looks lovely, and I feel like I want to live there, it is a little better. My boyfriend is better at pointing out that if we don't like the wall color we can fix that. I tend not to have much imagination about that stuff.''
 Kelly Cole, an agent with the Corcoran Group, is working with Ms. Hunter and Mr. Guilmet. She has cleaned litter boxes, wiped down counters and cleaned up accidents after pets while showing her own apartment listings. ''I'm really surprised that people don't heed the advice of industry professionals,'' she said. ''I don't know if it is denial or if people think that because it is a sellers' market it will sell anyway. But it is a numbers game. Who knows what you will get when you clean up?''
 Lisa Lemisch Lazarus, an occupational therapist who put her Riverside Drive apartment on the market last fall, was skeptical about the idea of investing in an apartment she was leaving. Not only did she make back the $5,000 she put into the property, which was listed at $995,000, but she made another $100,000 because it went into a bidding war after 30 days on the market and is in contract for $1.1 million. 
 Susan Nierenberg, a broker for Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, Ms. Lazarus's agent, insisted that this was not ''designing to live, but designing to leave,'' and aimed to make the cozy apartment into a spa-like environment. ''It's as if you were going to a fancy-schmancy hotel for three months.'' 
 The 1,400-square-foot two-bedroom, untouched since Ms. Lazarus moved in 18 years earlier and did her own renovations, was repainted with a neutral cream color going over the lavender walls. White sheer curtains were placed on the windows to pull light in and a spray of bright flowers was placed in front of windows looking out to another building to distract the eye from the unappealing view. Ms. Lazarus spent two weeks sorting through her crafts supplies, packing up books and dishes and hauling away 20 years worth of National Geographic and Architectural Digest, with the help of her broker and her twin sister, Ellen Lemisch.
 She also spent at least two weeks crying. Ms. Lazarus said it was a scary process to face the erosion of familiarity around her. She wasn't the type of person, she said, to have silk flowers and a glass vase of cranberries in her house. She was alarmed not to have any books around. She was hurt to have to pack away the china and move out the furniture. But among the most painful was painting over the bathroom walls. 
 ''I had painted it celadon, this bright green color,'' Ms. Lazarus said. ''As the painter is painting it white, I'm standing there with tears running down my face and he said, 'Let it go. Just let it go.'''
 Through it all, Ms. Lazarus recalled, her agent was a cheerleader. ''I would cry and she would say, 'No, no, no. There are no tears in real estate.' It was her mantra. It did make a difference. She kept me focused on the goal, which was to sell the apartment and get the most out of it.''
 When the work was done Ms. Lazarus told her agent that it was not her house anymore. Ms. Nierenberg, who has trained in staging properties for quicker sale, told her, ''Then I've done my job,'' adding, ''Every house speaks, and I control what it says.''
 She is also careful about how she deals with sellers, tending to bring in her partner to make more controversial suggestions, particularly regarding hygiene and odors. 
 ''As the broker you are their knight in armor,'' she said. ''The seller needs to have every confidence you love the apartment. You can't be the one to say, your apartment smells like a cat.''
 Occasionally that job falls to Dana Williams, who is the director of concierge services for Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy. and, among other things, arranges for the painters and cleaners to come into an apartment. Often agents will bring her in to tell a client that there is a need to clean up and clear out the apartment. 
 ''People are very aware of it,'' Ms. Williams said. ''They are almost embarrassed. Just selling their home can be emotional so you need a few people to be supportive.''
 But she can be tough when she needs to: ''I've been pretty forthright if there is a smell, from a cat or smoking. They may not smell it, but it slams me when I walk in.'' 
 Most agents agree that there is no need to get rid of the pets (or children for that matter), while the property is on the market as long as they are out of the house during showings and a cleanliness routine is maintained.
 Few agents have gone as far in transforming a space as Jacky Teplitzky, an executive vice president and agent for Douglas Elliman. She calls the two-month journey to transform an apartment on Gramercy Park North, priced at $1.995 million, her ''via Dolorosa'' of staging.
 When she visited the two-bedroom apartment in the back of the building that had been occupied by a tenant for 25 years, and had no park views, she knew she had a problem.
 "I needed to tell the owner she had to do several things,'' Ms. Teplitzky said. ''At the bare minimum we had to paint the walls and redo the floor. Some of the windows didn't have glass in them. There was a hole in the wall.'' Although the owner was hesitant, she agreed to go along with Ms. Teplitzky.
 Ms. Teplitzky arranged for a contractor to repair the walls, windows and some lights. The apartment also needed a ''very deep cleaning,'' she said, and some charming objects to distract from the fact that it not only lacked a park view, it had a difficult layout. 
 She said she rented some furniture, because nearly everything looks worse when it is empty, and even hired an architect to draw sketches of possible renovations, to inspire prospective buyers.
 ''If you spend $10,000,'' Ms. Teplitzky said, ''you might increase your price by $50,000.''
 Gus Perry, the principal broker and owner of Stein-Perry Real Estate in Washington Heights, said that he would never advise anyone to renovate a kitchen with the goal of getting a higher price. More important, he said, is editing out clutter, and engaging in constant cleaning.
 ''Clean windows, clean bathrooms,'' he said. ''It can be the oldest appliances in the world. It doesn't matter as much as if it is clean.''
 Ms. Hunter, searching for an apartment, agreed. ''Old is different than old and sticky,'' she said. But she said that sometimes brokers go too far. 
 She saw an apartment where the broker had lit an assortment of scented candles to cover a bad odor, but they only made the smell worse. ''She clearly meant it to be a good thing but the effect was quite the opposite,'' Ms. Hunter said. She and her boyfriend were driven out, she said, ''in a steam of an awful hazelnut, vanilla, ocean and rain candle smell.''

Clean, De-Clutter And Forget Purple
 TO get an apartment ready for sale, at the maximum price, most brokers will suggest cleaning, de-cluttering and choosing a neutral color scheme. Here are some specific tips:
 An unattractive view can be de-emphasized by placing by the window a brightly colored object, like a bunch of red flowers or an orange vase, which will catch the eye before it goes to the building wall across the way.
 Brown-colored stains on ceilings in unventilated bathrooms should be removed with a sponge and an all-purpose cleaning solution. Longer-lasting stains may require paint.
 Invest in a professional paint job and cleaning.
 Boost the illumination of windows that get little or idiosyncratic light by hanging white sheers over them. 
 Remove personal artifacts or collections that may be a distraction to buyers. (Brokers recalled how one seller had an elaborate doll collection that kept people from looking at the apartment. A gay couple with triplets, meanwhile, were asked to remove family photographs because they became the focal point of their home rather than the home itself.)
 There is no need to evict pets (or children) from an apartment while it is on the market, but all family members and animals should leave during showings. 
 Rearrange furniture on a slant to give the feeling of more floor space. ANNA BAHNEY

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, I saw a film like none I had seen before or have seen since. The movie, which I cannot name for reasons that will soon become clear, stars a legendary European beauty and was directed by a well-regarded filmmaker. It was a period piece, handsomely photographed but achingly dull, and it seized my attention only after the star was flung on her back for a torrid love scene, causing her hair to fall from her face like an opened curtain. But it wasn't the passion of the actress that transfixed me; it was the fresh surgical scars alongside her ear. 
 Later, when a colleague who had gasped along with me asked the film's director about the scars, he simply said, ''Oh, it is not a finished print.'' The implication being that, like the wires that support Hong Kong martial arts actors when they fly through the air, the scars would be erased before the film opened in theaters. The surgery had removed evidence of this beautiful woman's submission to time and nature, and her subsequent fight against them. The postproduction wizards would just finish the job for her. 
 Acting always involves an element of plasticity. Lon Chaney, the silent star known as the ''Man of a Thousand Faces,'' bound his legs behind his body to play a legless man and wore heavy weights to play Quasimodo. But while we admire actors who build hard muscle, pack on the pounds and downsize to skin and bone, no such glory awaits those who publicly admit to plastic surgery. Beauty in Hollywood is rarely natural, but it is highly prized, fetishized. Sharon Stone recently sued a surgeon, saying he falsely claimed to have given her a face-lift, and the suit puts a great deal of emphasis on the star's ''natural beauty,'' as in ''Sharon Stone prides herself not only on her acting ability and other talents, but also on her natural physical appearance'' (hair dye and Pilates notwithstanding). 
 Movie stars have always been put on diets, and had their hair and teeth straightened and bleached. Rita Hayworth's hairline was raised through electrolysis and imperfections were erased from Marilyn Monroe's chin. Noses have been bobbed, breasts enlarged, tummies tucked. But these alterations mostly remain the stuff of slander and innuendo, and certainly not serious film conversation. For the most part it's only trashy entertainment outlets that tackle the subject and lower-tier celebrities, like Patricia Heaton of ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' who admit to having had work done. Physical perfection is an illusion most stars cannot afford to shatter; for most it's easier, and certainly better publicity, to announce you're drying out in rehab than going in for an eyelid lift. 
 Yet today plastic surgery seems inescapable, inevitable. Our screens are crowded with freakishly plumped lips and breasts so round they look drawn by protractors. Easiest to spot are the plastic-surgery casualties: the character actor with misaligned ears, the actress who looks permanently stuck in a wind tunnel. These are surgery's cautionary tales, the waning careers and lost souls who, in attempting to hang onto fame, become grotesques. The bigger the star the better the surgery. But even when you look at the best face money can buy, something seems wrong with the picture. Take the star with a face like a mask: I wonder what she sees in the mirror? Does she see what I see on screen: a face without lines, but also without affect, history, life? 
 I see a lot of preternaturally swollen lips and un-furrowed brows as a film critic; I also see a lot because I live in Los Angeles, where it sometimes seems as if every other face has been surgically smoothed. The effects of this radical realignment -- bodies nipped, tucked and lipo-sucked -- are on magazine covers, nitwit talk shows, sober news programs, daytime soaps, nighttime dramas and every type of movie. For the most part, these overtly plasticized personalities are a matter of curiosity and some distaste. I find plastic surgery neither morally nor politically objectionable; what bothers me are the aesthetics, the cavalcade of look-alike noses, stretched cheeks and bulbous breasts. And it is, I find, becoming increasingly difficult to see the actors -- and the acting -- for the plastic surgery. 
 One of the pleasures of steady moviegoing is that if a performer has lasting power, you can grow up and then older along with them. That's true of stars you discover when they're young adults and even more so for those you follow from childhood, like Elizabeth Taylor and Winona Ryder. There is something satisfying about that first encounter with such actors, which becomes a marker by which to view the past, both theirs and yours. One such performer is Jennifer Jason Leigh, whom I first encountered when she was 19 in ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' (1982), rediscovered in her 20's as an exuberant sexpot in ''Miami Blues'' (1990), and then found once more as a lushly, unmistakably adult woman in Jane Campion's ''In the Cut'' (2003).
 Ms. Leigh looks like a real person, though more beautiful. By vivid contrast, consider a different, only somewhat older beautiful actress -- again, someone I can't name -- who when filmed in close-up barely seems able to move her face. Her forehead and cheeks are lustrously polished, almost glazed, like a pebble smoothed by centuries of pounding surf. When she cries on camera sound pours from her mouth -- and yet something is missing, a crinkle of pain around the eyes, a furrow of worry grooved between her manicured eyebrows. She looks like an exotic aristocrat, a porcelain figurine, a creature from another planet (think Hollywood). But she does not look like herself, at least that self I remember with fondness, the one who could put across a scene with feeling so honest it made you weep, too. 
 In Hollywood, 40 is the new 30 and 50 the new 40, but only, it seems, when that new 40 and 50 have been surgically enhanced. The spectacle of young-looking stars of all ages -- or, more accurately, stars without wrinkles, creases, furrows and folds -- has become commonplace and hard to ignore. Most of the obviously altered faces are female, which are also the most problematic since female actors are invariably damned for looking old and damned for doing nothing about it. These days, when a 40-plus-year-old actress lands a starring part opposite a 60-plus-year-old actor, such age-appropriate casting seems meaningless because the actress has a face as unlined as a teenage girl's. Hollywood rarely provides older women meaty parts, so it's no wonder that few older actresses look their age. 
 Anecdotally, plastic surgery has helped some performers and hurt others, turning some actors into cartoons and others into pinups. Throughout movie history, the actor's body has been contested terrain, a site of both symbolic and very real battles. In ''The Devil's Candy,'' her 1991 book about the making of Brian De Palma's ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' Julie Salamon writes that the film's celebrated cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond complained about Melanie Griffith's appearance. ''She doesn't mind those lines around her eyes? Those bags?'' asked Mr. Zsigmond. One of the producers joked that they should slather Preparation H on the star to shrink those bags. For her part, Ms. Griffith , then 33, responded with fabulous passive aggression: she had her breasts enlarged, mid-production. 
 These enhancements, alas, did nothing for Mr. De Palma's movie or Ms. Griffith's career. Big breasts are a dime a dozen in Hollywood. Actually, as of 2003, the most recent year for which such figures are provided by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the average cost for breast enhancement was $3,375, though it's unclear if that is for a single or a double. In any event, the amplitude of a star's breasts rarely merits scrutiny by film critics. Negative comments about actors' bodies are generally considered vulgar, inappropriate, but I am no longer certain polite silence is a good idea. After a decade of living in Los Angeles, for instance, I feel comfortable saying that it is a very bad idea when a woman enhances her breasts so they measure larger than her head. 
 What is undeniable and increasingly unavoidable is that plastic surgery is altering one of the greatest landscapes in cinema: the human face. Jean Renoir loved the close-ups of the silent era, because of what he believed they revealed ''about the inward life of the idealized woman.'' But close-ups also reveal the outward life of the idealized woman and as such can also betray the ideal. The great silent auteur D.W. Griffith didn't invent the close-up, but he perfected the technique and in doing so gave us the gift of faces like those of Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford. Griffith seemed to know that, and in a 1918 film he softened the edges in the close-ups of Gish because the star, then in her early 20's, was considered old for one of his heroines. 
 The great Hollywood studios were built on stars and the cults of beauty and youth that rose around them. It's worth noting that the rise of the classical studio star system parallels the increased acceptance and use of the close-up, which was not a popular technique until after the mid-teens. (As Griffith put it, ''the feet can't act.'') At least one critic has argued that DVD and video have fostered another boom in close-ups, but such real and extended shots seem rare in contemporary Hollywood. Not only because few filmmakers fix on an image for more than a few seconds, but also because many famous faces cannot withstand such detailed attention. These faces suggest that the digital avatars so beloved by cinematic technocrats will be able to replace the human actor more easily than some of us imagined. 
 There are faces that remain recognizably human, thankfully, like that of Paul Giamatti. Mr. Giamatti, as has been repeated ad nauseam by this critic among others, is not in possession of classic good looks. No matter. In ''Sideways,'' his director, Alexander Payne, affectionately holds the camera on Mr. Giamatti as if the actor were Greta Garbo, taking in each micro-movement flickering across his face. Such discreet fluctuations are impossible with a face shot full of Botox. My second favorite close-up of last year belongs to Julia Roberts, who in ''Closer'' had the guts to let the camera come in for an intimate appraisal, lines and all. Ms. Roberts has rarely looked more lovely or seemed more touching; not because she looked flawless, but because she did not.
 In the recent past, about the only way a layperson could witness breast augmentation or liposuction was on a cable TV surgery program. These days plastic surgery is within the economic reach of the middle class and is part of our pop-culture vernacular. There are reality television shows like ''The Swan,'' in which so-called ordinary women undergo multiple radical surgeries, and the fictional cable drama ''Nip/Tuck.'' In celebrity magazines, stars routinely swear off future surgery and, every so often, insist that they're taking a wait-and-see attitude. A few celebrities confess to surgeries and, when they don't, some magazines employ plastic surgeons who speculate which star might have had surgery and where. Meanwhile, on the Internet the anonymous post before-and-after photographs of the famous and the rest of us click in for a peek. 
 This is a repellent sport. We have always maintained a love-hate relationship with our stars, but we seem ever more dedicated to tearing them down as fast as we build them up. I am increasingly distracted and alarmed by what plastic surgery is doing to the movies, but I never want to lose sight of the human factor either. There is, it's worth repeating, a person behind that frozen smile. Clearly, part of the blame for the spectacle of the post-human lies with the movie industry and its pernicious sexism; after all, Sean Penn wins awards with a face crosshatched with lines. But while it's easy to blame the industry, the entertainment media, the satellite industries and the stars themselves, let's face it: the other culprit, the faithful keeper of the cults of beauty and youth, is staring out at us in the mirror.

HEADLINE: It's Cold on the Trading Floors, Too

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market fell for its third consecutive week as rising oil prices and declining consumer confidence deepened the slump of 2005.
 There has not been a week of net gains for the market since the year began. 
On Friday, crude oil prices in New York reached $48.53 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 30, and the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index showed a decline for December. Both factors weighed on the market.
 May Department Stores rose nearly 18 percent for the week, the biggest gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, on reports that Federated Department Stores is interested in a merger of the two companies. Delta Air Lines had the index's biggest weekly decline, more than 18 percent, after recording a $2.2 billion loss in the fourth quarter.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 165.01 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 10,392.99. The S.& P. 500 dropped 16.65 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 1,167.87. The Nasdaq composite index fell 53.64 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 2,034.27.
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.14 percent from 4.22 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Coffee, Tea or Regulation?

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
MARILYN FREEMAN fondly remembers being treated like royalty by the American Airlines crew on her honeymoon flight to Hawaii 30 years ago. Just out of college, she and her husband, Gary, were pampered with Champagne and personal attention from the flight attendants. ''It was a privileged situation,'' she recalled.
 These days, she said, her biggest treat on business trips is finding an empty seat next to her. And Mrs. Freeman, 51, the co-founder of an investment firm in Stamford, Conn., is similarly amazed when flights arrive or depart on schedule. Flying in the current airline environment, she said, ''isn't pretty; it isn't fun; it isn't pleasant.''
 But does she pine for the good old days of regulated air travel? Not in the least. Even with the crowds, the delays, the occasionally surly service and all the other problems of modern air travel, her flights are much cheaper and her choices far broader than they were before deregulation. 
 Her previous firm had a contract with American, which limited where she could fly and routinely charged $800 and up for a round trip to cities like Chicago and West Palm Beach, Fla. Now, when she books the same trips on the Internet, she generally pays no more than $400 on a variety of airlines like Southwest, JetBlue and ATA. And she travels from the New York airport of her choice, usually at a time that suits her schedule.
 She said she is convinced that going back to regulated service -- when prices were high and the government, not passenger demand, set the frequency and destination of flights -- isn't the answer. ''Good and healthy competition'' will pull the airlines out of their morass, Mrs. Freeman said.
 But others, including representatives of labor unions and some consumer groups, long for the stability of the time, before 1978, when the government decided fares and determined where airlines would fly. Labor unions in particular are looking for an alternative to the current situation, having been hit this decade by five airline bankruptcies, the elimination of more than 120,000 jobs and cuts of as much as 50 percent in pay and benefits.
 These groups say it is time to consider reregulating airlines, or at least to start a debate about how to stabilize an industry that may be so vital to the nation's fabric that government intervention is warranted. 
 As yet, there is not one single measure behind which these proponents have rallied. And because the Democratic Party, a traditional ally of organized labor, is out of power, Congress could easily turn a deaf ear. But that is not stopping union leaders and others from floating ideas, like asking the government to require airlines to charge a flat fee per seat mile, or changing the pension system to protect workers' benefits that are being eroded by the industry's deepening problems. 
 SOME people have even suggested forbidding companies to start new airlines. The idea is that such a move would cap competitive pressures now and could make life easier for those who survive if some airlines fail in the future.
 ''Are we willing to accept the results of a free marketplace, or do we think the role of commercial aviation is such a part of our economy that we have to have government influence?'' asked Patricia A. Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, a labor union that represents about 75,000 airline employees. ''It's a conversation I'd like to have before everyone wakes up and asks, 'What the hell happened?'''
 What has happened, those who follow the industry say, is that deregulation is finally causing the seismic shift that free-market advocates expected to occur long before now. ''It's hard to doubt that we've reached some kind of climax of the previous kind of system,'' said Alfred E. Kahn, former head of the Civil Aeronautics Board, who oversaw deregulation more than a quarter-century ago.
 Airline executives say they never anticipated that deregulation would precipitate a crisis as deep or as long as the present one, in which the industry has lost $30 billion over the last five years, compounded by high jet fuel prices that have removed the airlines' breathing space. ''This is not a criticism, but a question: Is this really the best way to try and run a giant industry?'' asked Ron Ricks, the chief Washington lobbyist for Southwest, the only big airline to post a profit for 2004.
 But even as the pain hobbles unions and irritates consumers, the benefits of deregulation outweigh its drawbacks, its proponents say. ''All that regulation would do is put back the problems it originally caused,'' said Clifford Winston, a senior economist at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning research organization. 
 Since federal restrictions on routes and fares were removed, consumers have been saving $20 billion a year on air fares, when adjusted for inflation, according to Brookings. Fares have dropped by more than 30 percent, on average, and as much as 70 percent when tickets are bought in advance, the group concluded.
 At the same time, airlines have vastly expanded their networks, bringing air travel -- a relatively infrequent experience when the Freemans took their honeymoon -- to people all over the country. For example, American, the biggest airline, flew to just 50 cities in 1975; it now serves more than three times that number. Southwest, which started in 1971 with a single route in Texas, now flies to 61 cities, not counting those it serves through a code-sharing arrangement with ATA.
 ''Most people who have a history of flying know that the air fares available today are far, far lower than what they were, and the choices are far better than they were in regulation,'' Mr. Ricks said.
 But it is difficult to remind fliers of past weaknesses when they are stranded without suitcases, as happened to thousands of passengers of US Airways over the Christmas holiday when its baggage system at Philadelphia broke down. Some passengers did not get their luggage for as long as a week.
 LAWRENCE Kudlow, an economist and the co-host of ''Kudlow & Cramer'' on CNBC, said in an interview that he still did not understand why his bags were never loaded onto a direct US Airways flight from La Guardia Airport in New York to Virginia Beach on Christmas Eve. As a result, he had to wear the same pinstriped suit for two days during a family reunion. Frustrated at hearing nothing from the airline, he ultimately went back to the Virginia Beach airport and found his suitcases amid hundreds on the floor of the baggage area.
 Despite his experience, he said that airlines should find their own solutions -- and that government intervention would only worsen the situation. ''You don't want to Post Office-ize or Amtrak-ize the airlines,'' he said.
 Mr. Winston, the Brookings economist, said that the benefits of deregulation were rarely emphasized. ''It's the catastrophic nature of this industry that constantly gets attention,'' he said.
 Others, however, say they believe the situation requires the government to become involved -- if nothing else, to talk about solutions. This month, for example, the Business Travel Coalition, which represents business travelers and corporate travel departments, called for the development of a national air transportation policy, saying the industry was too vital to the country to be left unscrutinized. At the same time, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers asked Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta to convene a summit meeting of management, labor and consumer groups in an effort to stop the industry's mounting losses.
 Rodney E. Slater, who was transportation secretary in the Clinton administration, called a similar meeting in August 2000, after the industry endured a delay-pocked travel season remembered as ''the summer from hell.'' A labor-management panel came up with a series of recommendations that led to consumers receiving more information on the causes of airline delays.
 Mr. Slater, who now works as a lawyer in Washington, said the current situation might benefit from examination. ''I'm sure some kind of good could come out of a meeting like that,'' he said.
 In a statement, Mr. Mineta said he would be happy to meet with the machinists' union, which represents more than 100,000 baggage handlers, mechanics and ramp workers. But Mr. Mineta, the only Democrat in President Bush's cabinet, stopped short of promising anything more.
 PREVIOUS airline crises prompted similar calls for action by federal regulators and by Congress, which would have to authorize any new regulations. But past crises also prompted competitive solutions, including mergers, the development of frequent-flier programs to help retain customers, and computerized reservation systems, which helped airlines manage their inventories of unsold tickets and decide when to cut fares.
 This time, airlines seem determined to address the problem primarily by cutting labor costs, said Robert Roach Jr., the vice president for transportation at the machinists' union. The six traditional airlines have already announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs in 2005, on top of previous reductions in wages and benefits. ''The industry is not looking for any way to recoup these losses except through the pockets of workers,'' Mr. Roach said.
 He added that he was alarmed that airlines, in a frantic bid for customers, often charge less for tickets than it costs them to carry those passengers. ''That would be O.K. if they were making money,'' he said, ''but they are not making money.''
 Mr. Roach wants the Transportation Department to require airlines to charge at least what it costs them to transport passengers -- a plan that would appear to run counter to the goal of deregulation, which was to let the market determine the fares that customers would accept. The Airline Mechanics Fraternal Association, a rival to the machinists' union, also has floated a proposal to charge a set fee per mile for plane tickets.
 Jim Atkinson, the president of the mechanics' union at Northwest Airlines, acknowledged in a newsletter last fall that the idea might not be popular with passengers. But the objective, he told union members, is ''to stop this game and get the airlines back on their feet.''
 Michael W. Tretheway, an industry analyst who is executive vice president of Intervistas Consulting in Vancouver, British Columbia, countered the unions' argument with a single word: Southwest. That airline, the biggest of the low-fare operations, carries more passengers within the United States than any other airline and is the sixth-largest United States airline over all. Its fares are no more than $299 each way to a destination, and often much less.
 Still, he said, Southwest has remained profitable despite the industry's fluctuations because of its relentless attention to costs. Last week, it said it earned $313 million in 2004, when airlines like American, Delta and Northwest collectively lost billions. A minimum fare that leads to profits for those old-style airlines may be well above what Southwest needs to charge, Mr. Tretheway said. 
 Moreover, it has been demonstrated many times that when fares go low enough, passengers will fill planes. This month, Delta and US Airways generated record Web site traffic with sweeping fare cuts. Delta reduced fares by up to 50 percent, and US Airways had a heavily advertised two-day fare sale that was so popular that the offer was repeated last week.
 But Mr. Roach, the union official, said that such moves ''could be a problem for the entire industry.'' The solution, he said, was for government leaders to ''sit everyone down in a room and try to make some sense of it.''
 The last time the government became directly involved in helping the airlines was just 17 days after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Congress passed a $15 billion bailout bill that provided $5 billion in cash and $10 billion in loan guarantees for the struggling airlines and created the Air Transportation Stabilization Board to administer them.
 The board's chairman, Edward M. Gramlich, who is also a governor of the Federal Reserve, said the board's mission was to address a short-term emergency, not to ''get in the way of normal market transformations.''
 Some industry leaders, including Southwest's chairman, Herbert D. Kelleher Jr., said that the board did get in the way of market change, by acting as a life support for ailing airlines like ATA, Aloha and US Airways. Without the board's help, all might have disappeared, gone the way of carriers like T.W.A., Pan American World Airways, Eastern and Braniff, which could not compete in a deregulated industry. As it was, the three ailing airlines all received government-backed loans, defaulted on them, and have been allowed to keep flying by spending the cash they had pledged as collateral. 
 Given what happened with the transportation board's bailout, the industry would find it hard to seek another bailout, or even to ask for the kind of help that the airline unions want. The industry's legislative agenda this year focuses mainly on tax relief -- a perennial issue for its trade group, the Air Transport Association -- as well as pension reform.
 Mr. Tretheway, the industry analyst, said it would be best for the airlines to again figure out a solution themselves. The current crisis is no different than those faced by the airlines in the early 1980's, when the first wave of low-fare carriers emerged, or in the early 1990's, when a streak of airline bankruptcies swept some players off runways, he said. Each time, the airlines found ways to adjust. ''Essentially, once a decade an industry like this goes through major changes in technology, changing consumer tastes and business models,'' he said.
 But Mr. Roach, the union official, said he believed that airlines could not solve the problem by themselves. ''All of labor has got to understand -- and all of government has got to understand -- that we need each other,'' he said. ''It's like a chain on a bicycle: if one link is broken, we aren't going anywhere.''
 For her part, Ms. Friend of the flight attendants' union said the only strategy she could see among the airlines was ''to be the last man standing.'' She said she sensed that the industry was secretly wishing for a carrier to fail, in the hope that it would eliminate seats and raise prices. That, she said, would be disastrous for the industry's workers.
 But Mr. Gramlich at the loan board said the current situation did not unduly alarm him. ''If I felt that we were doing something that was reducing overall airline capacity, I would have been more concerned,'' he said. ''But there has been a huge expansion of airline capacity and flights.''
 AND travelers like Mrs. Freeman are taking full advantage of that.
 Last week, she and her husband took a trip from New York to Nassau, the Bahamas, to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. When they married, the tickets would have cost the equivalent of $464 each in today's dollars, and the route would have been served by three airlines -- American, Delta and Eastern. Now, their tickets cost $228 each and they could choose from six airlines: US Airways, American, JetBlue, Continental, Delta and Song, a low-fare operation started by Delta two years ago.
 The more such choices, Mrs. Freeman said, ''the better for us.''

HEADLINE: Want to Invest Abroad? Maybe You Already Have

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
GOOD ideas are hard to come by on Wall Street. Conventional wisdom, on the other hand, is common. Investors would be wise to remember that distinction as they put their ideas to work this year.
 For individual investors, perhaps the most popular move so far in 2005 is to look abroad. Foreign stocks, already attractively valued, have been even more alluring to American investors because of the weakening dollar. The average international stock fund rose more than 18 percent in 2004, in dollar terms; the average emerging-markets stock fund was up more than 25 percent. 
 Not surprisingly, foreign equity portfolios have attracted significant sums of new money this month. Investors plowed about $2 billion into international stock funds through Jan. 19, putting these funds on a pace to collect $3.4 billion for the month, according to www.Trimtabs.com, the Web site for Trimtabs Investment Research, a firm based in Santa Rosa, Calif., that tracks mutual funds.
 By comparison, domestic stock funds had net outflows of $2.6 billion. ''Interest in international funds is just exploding,'' said Carl Wittnebert, director of research for Trimtabs.
 But before deciding to shift additional assets into international portfolios, investors should keep one thing in mind: there is a great likelihood that mutual fund managers have already had the same idea.
 Consider Jeffrey L. Knight, lead manager of the Putnam Asset Allocation Balanced fund, who said that there were essentially three reasons for his move to invest in more international equities. 
 For starters, foreign shares, on average, are cheaper than domestic stocks. Moreover, he expects the dollar to continue to weaken against foreign currencies. Then there is what he calls the ''rebalancing of the global economy.'' Mr. Knight said that from 1997 to 2002, about 95 percent of the world's economic growth could be attributed to the United States. ''That's unsustainable,'' he said, adding that economic activity in Europe and Asia was likely to outpace growth in the United States in the coming years and even out the imbalance. As a result, he has increased his fund's stake in international stocks to as much as 20 percent from the normal 10 percent. 
 Investors in general, he added, should check whether their money managers were already making such decisions on their behalf. ''If you want to make a 15 percent investment in international stocks and then discover that you already have 8 or 9 percent, you might find yourself overexposed to this idea, especially if it goes against you,'' he said.
 Mike Scarborough, president of the Scarborough Group, an investment adviser in Annapolis, Md., says that while a few additional percentage points of foreign exposure ''may seem negligible, it's a real concern.''
 For example, what if the conventional wisdom is wrong and the dollar strengthens instead of weakens? What if foreign shares lag behind the domestic market this year? 
 Moreover, investors should consider the indirect exposure they may already have to overseas business, thanks to the global economy. For example, more than half of the revenue derived by domestic technology companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index comes from outside the United States. And more than a third of the sales generated by American industrial companies come from abroad.
 Caution is also advised now that some mutual funds are committing a sizable proportion of their assets to foreign holdings. For example, Mutual Beacon, a value-oriented domestic portfolio, recently held nearly a third of its assets in foreign securities, according to Morningstar Inc., as did Janus Orion, a growth-oriented domestic stock portfolio. 
 Over all, the average domestic stock fund recently held 5.6 percent of its assets in European and Asian stocks. Those that committed even more resources overseas generally added to their performance last year. Among domestic stock funds that finished in the top third of their respective categories in 2004, the average foreign stake was more than 7.3 percent. 
 Investors in sector funds are probably gaining even more exposure overseas. ''Most sector funds like health care, technology, certainly energy are global in scope,'' said Roseanne Pane, a mutual fund strategist at S.&P.
 Martin Vostry, a research analyst at Lipper, the fund tracker based in New York, recently crunched the numbers and found that the average telecommunications sector fund invested nearly 24 percent of its assets overseas. And $1 of every $5 invested in a natural resources fund was invested abroad, he found. 
 JACK ABLIN, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, in Chicago, said some managers were beginning to regard international equities as no different from domestic stocks. ''There is a mind-set out there that says we shouldn't look country to country, but rather industry to industry and you shouldn't care where the company is from,'' he said. ''For instance, you're not buying Nokia because you like Finland.''
 Don't expect the love affair with foreign holdings to end anytime soon. A recently completed survey of fund managers by Merrill Lynch found that 49 percent said they were overweighting emerging-markets stocks and 53 percent said they were adding to their normal positions in European equities. At the same time, nearly half said they were moderately or aggressively underweighting domestic stocks.
 That may turn out to be a good idea. But an even better one for mutual fund investors, said Christine Benz, Morningstar's associate director of fund analysis, ''is to drill down and check how much foreign stock exposure you already have.''

HEADLINE: New Location, Same Truffles

BYLINE: By LOUISE KRAMER

 BODY:
VALENTINE'S DAY will be especially important this year for Martha Bond, the owner of Li-Lac Chocolates, one of New York's oldest and best-loved candy stores. It will be the first big holiday since she moved Li-Lac eight blocks north after 81 years on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. 
 When her landlord tripled her rent and refused to offer a long lease, Ms. Bond, 60, agonized over whether to move her store or close it. 
 ''I couldn't sleep for months,'' Ms. Bond said. ''What if people didn't like it or nobody came?''
 In a city where many blocks provide virtually every human need, be it food, clothing or manicure, eight blocks can seem like eight miles, even if it is a matter of satisfying a yen for fine chocolate. 
 ''They might as well be in another country,'' said Ira Davidson, director of the Manhattan regional office of the New York State Small Business Development Center at Pace University. ''She is going to have to rely on new business. Any old business she keeps will be gravy.''
 Ms. Bond, originally from Gulfport, Miss., decided to take a chance. She has been running Li-Lac since 1982 and still loves peddling her store-made truffles, fudge and butter crunch. She is proud that she provides work for a dozen full-time employees, including the head candymaker, Anwar Khoder, a native of Lebanon who learned his craft in the store. Not even her recent engagement to a long-ago sweetheart who lives in Mississippi was enough to tip the balance in favor of closing.
 Earlier this month, Ms. Bond relocated Li-Lac from 120 Christopher Street to a bright storefront at 40 Eighth Avenue at Jane Street, a space that is larger than her old store but a comparable rent. Her real savings will come from another move. After Easter, she plans to relocate her chocolate factory, which had been squeezed into a space next to her shop -- rent that had also tripled -- to Sunset Park, Brooklyn. 
 A few days before Li-Lac's debut, several passersby peered in, among them the actress Kathleen Chalfant, who lives around the corner. ''We've all been waiting with bated breath,'' she told a clearly delighted Ms. Bond.
 Garber's Hardware, a West Village mainstay for more than a century, made a similar eight-block move in 2003 because of a rent increase. Many customers have remained loyal, but some, especially older customers, found it too far to walk, said Nathaniel Garber Schoen, a great-great grandson of the founder. He said Ms. Bond ''might not see all the same people, but she will see plenty.'' 
 Ms. Bond's hunt for space might have been fruitless without Bruce Camacho, a landlord with a sweet spot for Li-Lac. His girlfriend's grandmother was born above the store on Christopher Street, and he has shopped there since he was a boy. Mr. Camacho had inquiries from Starbucks, some prominent restaurateurs and a pornography shop, all with more money to spend. ''It will be really nice to have a homey type of store,'' he said. ''Li-Lac is one of the last.''
 Li-Lac has been immune to concerns about weight and the uncertain economy. The candy sells for an average of $30 a pound. New competition from stores like Jacques Torres Chocolate Haven, a combination chocolate factory and store at Hudson and King Streets, have not put a dent in sales. ''They make more people aware of chocolate,'' Ms. Bond said. 
 Ms. Bond financed the shop from her savings. In Sunset Park, she leased an entire building, and is working to secure a construction loan and breaks for taxes and utilities with help from the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation. ''This kind of company is flourishing in our community,'' said Phaedra Thomas, co-interim executive director of the development organization. ''They are not competing with China to do mass production.'' Employment in Sunset Park has increased 44 percent, to 33,000 since early 2000, she said.
 While some food merchants are born with a taste for the business, Ms. Bond never much thought about chocolate when she was growing up. She spent the first part of her career helping to run a jewelry business in Mississippi. One of her brothers, Edward Bond, ran a catering company in Manhattan that served Li-Lac chocolates. When the owner of the chocolate store was ready to retire, she sold him the business. Then Mr. Bond lured his sister north to run it. He sold it to her in 1988. 
 ''I came in and learned everything and loved it, and the rest is history,'' said Ms. Bond, a low-key, friendly woman who carries an umbrella decorated with images of chocolate, and whose lilac-colored sweater matched the color of her new display cases. She enjoys sampling her wares and has wrinkle-free skin, a fact she jokingly attributes to ingesting lots of cocoa butter. 
 She is looking forward to Feb. 14. ''I expect quite a last-minute rush. Men will forget that it's Valentine's Day until they get to work and someone reminds them. Then they'll be desperately seeking chocolates.''

HEADLINE: Not Too Fancy, Except for the Views

BYLINE: By JENNIE GREEN

 BODY:
TAKE a random sampling of New Yorkers and ask them: ever hear of the Lincoln Tunnel? They'll tell you, ''Of course!'' Now ask the same group if they've ever heard of Weehawken. Among the head-scratchers, some will think they know, while others actually do know. But chances are they won't be in the majority. 
 Still, for anyone who has ever wondered where the Lincoln Tunnel ends, or begins, the answer is Weehawken. Weehawken, New Jersey. 
 The Lincoln Tunnel, which opened in 1937, is a relatively new development in the history of Weehawken. First incorporated as a township in 1859, Weehawken was originally home to 269 people. Because of its proximity to New York, a percentage of the residents have always toiled in office buildings east of the Hudson. Yet thriving rail and manufacturing companies on the west bank of the river in the first half of the 20th century gave Hudson County economic autonomy, which fertilized the local soil in which many small businesses and close-knit communities took root. 
 Nearby Jersey City is huge, and Hoboken underwent a thorough gentrification that started in the 1980's. But Weehawken, which is just north of Hoboken (10 minutes by car unless tunnel traffic is especially thick) and only a couple of blocks wide, has remained largely unchanged since the 1940's. So much so that Anthony Keating, who moved his family back east from Olympia, Wash., five years ago and bought from his mother the house on Columbia Terrace where he grew up, pointed from an enclosed front porch to the street where his two sons and their friends played touch football. ''See, the goals are exactly the same as they were when I was a kid,'' he said. ''Manhole cover in front of the house to the fire hydrant on the other end of the block. We played a lot of stickball, too, which has been replaced by whiffle ball in an effort to save windows.''
 To many New Yorkers, the concept of living and raising a family in the same house they were raised might seem unusual. Not so for a surprising number of people from Weehawken. The school superintendent, Kevin J. McLellan, grew up in Weehawken, as did Richard Barsa, who was appointed to the nonpaying position of Board of Education president. 
 Barbara Tulko, a broker associate for Re/Max Villa Realtors who some refer to as the queen of Weehawken real estate, grew up in Jersey City but so enjoyed family outings to visit an ice cream truck that parked along Boulevard East that she often said to herself, ''I'm going to live here some day.''
 Airy and open largely because of its position atop the Palisades, the township of Weehawken is a place where residents have been comfortable with ethnic and economic diversity for many generations. A Cuban community that took root among Irish, Italian and German immigrants in the 1950's eventually paved the way for Hispanics from a host of other South American and Latin American countries. More recently, a Middle Eastern community has started to form. 
 A new development, owned and operated by Weehawken, will add a performing arts center and recreation facility that will encompass sports fields, basketball courts, a swimming pool and many playgrounds. This project will be set on 11 acres of a larger development that starts at Lincoln Harbor -- where the ferry terminal is and where a town house condominium, hotel and several restaurants have already been built -- and is to stretch north to the border with West New York. 
 The biggest problem with Weehawken nowadays is that there isn't enough of it to go around. According to Ms. Tulko, 60 percent of all Weehawken residents rent their homes, and while many of them are eager to buy, most can't find anything within their price ranges. 
 Rents for a one-bedroom apartment range from $1,000 to $1,500, depending on the level of luxury. A two-bedroom apartment in a private home averages about $1,500 a month, and starts at $2,000 a month in a luxury building.
 Tightness in the real estate market, however, was not always the case. Only five years ago, when Weehawken, along with many of its Hudson County neighbors, was starting to emerge from a decades-long economic slump, there were still plenty of one- and two-family homes on the market for $200,000 and under. 
 According to Ms. Tulko, sharp increases in the price of real estate have been driven by the New York City market and skyrocketing house prices in affluent New Jersey suburbs. In addition, people who lived and worked in Manhattan could see new waterfront row houses being built from across the river. A quick phone call would reveal the million-dollar asking price for these town house condominiums, but for many people who had considered spending the same amount on a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, 4,000 square feet on four floors became a reasonable argument for an exploratory 10-minute ferry ride across the river. ''Already over here, they'd wander up the hill and start poking around,'' Ms. Tulko said. ''For less than the price of the condo and no maintenance fees, they could move into a sprawling Victorian in great condition. It's not rocket science.''
 Although she has been the beneficiary of soaring real estate costs, Ms. Tulko is the first to express a sense of astonishment. One example is a two-family house that sold twice within 16 months -- first in June 2003 for $450,000, and again in October 2004 for $585,000. 
 Low-end Weehawken real estate includes co-ops and condominiums in the $200,000 to $400,000 range. At the next level up ($400,000 to $650,000) spacious and newly renovated condos, and one- or two-family detached houses in a range of conditions are available. High-end properties ranging from $660,000 to more than $1 million tend to be rambling, turn-of-the-last-century houses in great condition, or waterfront town-house condominiums with every newly constructed bell and whistle.
 The lack of glitz along Park Avenue, Weehawken's commercial strip, is more bothersome to some than to others. Mr. Keating, for instance, is happy to zip over to Hoboken for fancy breads and cheeses, and then return to his unpresumptuous Weehawken, which he describes as a ''real'' place. 
 Karen Brady, on the other hand, who moved to Weehawken from New York City as a young adult and has lived in town for the last 20-odd years, thinks that Park Avenue could use a nip here and a tuck there. ''The municipal government has been really proactive about gaining funding for public works projects, such as parks and schools,'' she said. ''Now, I think, it would be great to support local commerce.'' 
 In fact, Weehawken's commercial thoroughfare is more serviceable than destination-oriented, with bodegas and hardware stores under old-fashioned bubble awnings. The avenue, with its conspicuous lack of upscale coffee shops, day spas, children's clothing boutiques and fancy kitchen gadget stores, does not say, ''Stroll me.'' 
 Ms. Brady, who ran for the City Council and currently volunteers as a representative for a new Chamber of Commerce that she helped create, expects Park Avenue to evolve soon. 
 The Weehawken school district, recently overhauled with a fresh infusion of local and state funds to help restore its reputation for academic excellence after a low point during the 1980's, is becoming yet another selling point for the town. According to Mr. McLellan, the school superintendent, small schools and class sizes are the key to success. Weehawken High School, which encompasses Grades 7 through 12, offers more advanced-placement courses than any other school in the state, he said, while 85 to 90 percent of the students are college bound. Moreover, state testing at Grades 4, 8, and 11 have placed Weehawken students in the top 10 percent statewide.
 Anthony Keating, who is a lawyer, and his wife, Beth, who works as a manager at a state agency, never considered sending their three children to one of the private or charter schools in nearby Hoboken. ''When we moved back, we wanted to become part of the Weehawken public school community, and it's working out beautifully,'' Mr. Keating said. ''My kids are challenged and engaged, the school population is extremely diverse, and my wife and I have developed nice relationships with many of the other parents.'' 
 Mr. Keating hesitated a moment before concluding: ''When I was growing up in Weehawken during the 1960's and 70's, people from outside Hudson County would often say disparaging things about the area. But those of us who actually lived in Weehawken never felt the shame that others tried to impose. My wife and I feel lucky to be raising our family here.''

HEADLINE: Believe It or Not, Five-Figure Homes

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
IT was big news in December when a couple paid $45 million in cash for an 18,000-square-foot waterfront estate in East Hampton. Real estate brokers called it the highest price ever for a home in New York. 
 But there was perhaps more stunning Long Island real estate news made with far less fanfare last year over on the North Shore, in the small cottage community of Woodcliff Park in Baiting Hollow.
 There, Floyd and Evelyn Chivvis, 69 and 65 respectively, plunked down $40,000 for a two-bedroom cottage with a living room, a small L-shaped kitchen, a dining area and a cellar. 
 It's a short walk from the 700-square-foot home on Cottage Road, which the Chivvises have already renovated, to a 36-step wooden stairway ending right on the shore of Long Island Sound.
 On the beach just below the Woodcliff Park bluffs, rowboats rest behind pilings for the winter. In mid-April, cottage owners can return to put them in, open up their summer homes, plant flowers in their small gardens and join neighbors for beach parties until October rolls around.
 The Chivvises made no headlines when they paid perhaps the lowest price for a house near the water, perhaps for any kind of house, on Long Island last year. But they did make themselves happy.
 ''I had been searching the North Fork for several years,'' Evelyn Chivvis said by telephone from the couple's home in Lindenhurst. ''I always had a dream to have a little cottage close to the water, something that wasn't too expensive. I had gone all over. And everything I found was at least $300,000.'' And those, she added, needed a lot of work.
 But fixing up the small cottage -- adding new siding and a new roof and furnishing the interior -- was a lot of fun, she said. Her blue-tinted glass bottle collection now lines the windowsill, matching the home's new blue trim and window frames. 
 ''I was renovating it most of the summer,'' she said. ''But I was also enjoying it because I'd go out in the morning to the water. Or I'd work on my little garden, or I'd paint.''
 Most of the cottage owners lease the land from Woodcliff Park's owner, Benjamin Karlin. Cottage owners pay taxes to the Town of Riverhead. Ms. Chivvis said the couple pay about $3,000 a year in combined taxes and lease charges. 
 It is not a high price, considering the benefits. ''That's totally insane,'' said Enzo Morabito of Prudential Douglas Elliman real estate. ''You're paying $3,000 a year to live by the water for the summer.'' By comparison, he noted, ''A summer rental cottage steps away from the water in the Hamptons, a cottage or a shack, let's say in Springs or in Amagansett, you would still pay $30,000 or $40,000 for a rental for just the summer.'' 
 But the low prices and summer-camp flavor of the 50-year-old Baiting Hollow community and others like it -- Sound Beach, Wading River and Oakwood on the Sound -- may fast be fading.
 ''These cottage communities are rapidly disappearing,'' said Pearl Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association in Hauppauge. ''The reality of the housing market on Long Island is that anything near the waterfront is being grabbed up rather quickly and luxury housing is being built.''
 Paul Basileo of Basileo Real Estate in Rocky Point, who sold the Chivvises their cottage, was in a rush recently as he showed visitors another cottage for sale in the park for $79,990. An hour later, he was holding an open house only a few hundred feet down the road for one of the new condominiums at the Fox Hill Golf and Country Club. Prices in the year-round condos start at $400,000. 
 On another border of Woodcliff Park, just beyond a patch of woods, a group of large contemporary homes with high windowed peaks for rooftops encroached upon the view.
 There is little doubt that developers would like to have the land the cottages sit on. But the Chivvises are not very concerned about their land lease arrangement, Evelyn Chivvis said. Some of her Woodcliff Park neighbors have leased their lots for more than 30 years, she said.
 ''There are 178 houses in there, and I don't think you'll find 178 people sitting back and saying 'O.K., take my house,''' she said. ''At our age even if they did that, we would be going to court, and I'm sure we would still have several years to enjoy it.''
 Each cottage has a septic tank, and owners pay their own electric bills. Water charges are included in the lease fee, according to Steve Morrow, who manages the 40-acre Woodcliff Park property for Mr. Karlin, the owner.
 The cottage leasing arrangement is similar to that of a mobile home park. ''The danger always is that you own the trailer, but you don't own the land,'' said Marianne Garvin, executive vice president of the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, a not-for-profit housing counseling organization. 
 In addition, unlike cottage owners, mobile home owners usually do not have another home. ''When the entity who owns the land wants to sell it, there has been tragic displacement of people,'' she said.
 A search for other homes selling for less than $100,000 on the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island (www.mlslirealtor.com), which provides listings from its 2,200 Long Island members, returns mostly mobile home listings. 
 The under-$100,000 variety of mobile home ranges in price from a one-bedroom in Amityville for $15,000 (no photo provided) to a two-bedroom built in 1973 with a den, carport and washer and dryer for $97,000 in Bunker Hill Village, Bohemia. 
 The listing service also reported that at least four single-family properties sold for less than $100,000 last year. One of them, a ranch in Central Islip, sold for $99,000. ''It was in total disrepair, falling down,'' said Michael Mendicino of Millennium Homes real estate in Bay Shore, who sold the property. ''That house is lucky we found it.''
 The property was in foreclosure, he said, and the buyer, another real estate agent, negotiated a price with the bank, which Mr. Mendicino said had been owed about $150,000 on the previous owner's mortgage. The buyer plans to renovate the home and resell it, he said.
 ''Right now, in today's world, you can't buy dirt for a hundred grand,'' Mr. Mendicino said of the Long Island housing market. ''The dirt costs more than a foreclosed house.''
 But in Baiting Hollow at least, cottage buyers can still snag one of the last real estate bargains on Long Island. Mr. and Mrs. Chivvis have their 700 square feet of paradise to share with their children and six grandchildren while it lasts.
 ''Even though it's so tiny, what more could you want?'' Ms. Chivvis said. ''It's perfect.''

HEADLINE: Factories Rev Up (At Last) In the U.S.

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Ace Clearwater Enterprises, a Torrance, Calif., maker of custom parts for everything from jet planes to power plants, offered its 175 workers the choice between a shortened workweek and job cuts. This year it is staffing up. ''We've been in hiring mode for about a year now,'' said Gary Johnson, its vice president, who wants to bring his payroll up to 195.
 Manufacturing is back. Last year, producers of machinery increased employment by 22,000. Makers of computers and electronic products added 11,000 jobs. After six years of decline, manufacturing added 76,000 jobs in 2004. 
 The increase hardly makes a dent in the 2.8 million manufacturing jobs lost from 2000 to 2003, when manufacturing took the steepest dive since the early 1980's. No economist expects manufacturing to return to its peak of the 1970's, when it accounted for 20 percent of the nation's jobs, compared with 11 percent today.
 Yet as producers of everything from power generators to surgical devices guardedly add to their payrolls, some economists are cautiously optimistic that the decline of the former great job engine, which supported the rise of the nation's middle class through the postwar era, might have finally come to an end.
 ''We've probably hit bottom,'' said Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, who follows factory employment. ''We should see some benefits from the fall in the dollar so far. If the fall broadens against other currencies in Asia we could get more gains.''
 Manufacturing workers have had a rough century so far. Employment at manufacturers fell from 17.2 million at the end of 2000 to 14.3 million at the end of last year, the lowest level since 1950.
 Much of the blame lies in a combination of lackluster spending by businesses since the recession of 2001, which reduced demand for manufactured goods, and a burst of productivity growth as companies squeezed more out of their work force. Trade's role in this situation is in dispute. But as the nation's trade deficit has swollen, some American politicians have decided that imports -- notably from China -- displace American jobs.
 Currency manipulation by China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, the major Asian trading partners, has contributed significantly to the loss of United States factory jobs since July 2000, according to a bipartisan resolution introduced in 2003 by more than 50 House members.
Last September, nine House Democrats introduced a bill that would require the administration to embark on negotiations with China to set limits on imports of Chinese textiles into the United States.
 Yet while foreign products can displace production by American workers, many economists argue that imports had little to do with the steep decline in factory employment.
 To begin with, America and China do not manufacture the same things. Growing imports of Chinese goods have displaced imports from other countries, like Malaysia or Mexico, not American-made products.
 Moreover, the manufacturing jobs that America lost to trade during the 2000-2003 slump were mainly lost from weak exports, most economists say. Rather than reducing American employment, imports might have actually increased the number of American manufacturing jobs.
 In a recent study, Martin N. Baily, chairman the Council of Economic Advisers at the end of the Clinton administration, and Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, argued that because productivity grew so fast from 2000 to 2003, the number of American workers needed to produce a given product in the United States fell faster than manufactured imports grew. As a consequence, the number of factory jobs displaced by foreign products fell.
 Trade's contribution to manufacturing job loss came, instead, through exports, as a strong dollar whittled away at the competitiveness of American goods abroad. Mr. Baily and Mr. Lawrence concluded that while the export slump destroyed nearly 750,000 manufacturing jobs, imports lifted factory employment by over 425,000, yielding some 325,000 jobs lost because of trade.
 What does this mean for the future of manufacturing employment? Trade should contribute to employment growth as a weakening dollar helps American exports and reduces the competitiveness of imports. Trade is most likely to be a net positive for manufacturing jobs over the next 10 years, Mr. Baily said.
 Take Ace Clearwater's case. The high dollar almost cost the company a longstanding German client. And it lost about $6 million of business to Hungary. But as the dollar has declined, some of the Hungarian business seems to be coming back. Exports have risen from some 3 percent to 8 percent of Ace's total business.
 In the immediate future, manufacturing employment should benefit from the continued strength of the American economy, which is expected to grow 3.5 percent this year. Yet the future of manufacturing employment is not quite rosy. Continued productivity improvement is most likely to curb it over the long term.
 Trade is unlikely to provide much of a lift on the way out. Trade was not the problem, Mr. Lawrence said. But it may also not be the solution.

HEADLINE: Gold Prices? The Dollar Offers Clues

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
SOME precious-metals analysts may be wondering about their job security.
 To get a fix on the price of gold, they examine mine production, estimate the recycling of gold scrap, weigh the demand for gold jewelry, assess investor interest in gold bars and coins and keep an eye on inflation.
 Lately, however, you probably could have done just as well by watching the price of the euro against the dollar. The euro, as compared with the dollar, has moved pretty much in lock step with price of an ounce of gold. When the euro has jumped in value -- meaning that the value of the dollar has declined -- the price of gold has generally also climbed; it is now at $426.90 an ounce. 
 Since the dollar began a sharp decline against the euro on Aug. 30, there have been 82 days when the euro's value and the near-term gold futures contract moved in the same direction in New York. On only 17 days did the two go in opposite paths, and just once did that happen two days in a row. 
 It is no surprise that moves of the dollar and gold are related, with gold rising when the dollar falls. That is because many factors, like inflation or robust American stock and bond markets, often push the two in opposite directions.
 But in predicting gold prices, the dollar's strength against the euro has been a much more effective tool than its value against the Japanese yen. Over the same period, there were 34 days when the yen's value against the dollar did not move in lock step with gold. That is twice the number of days when the euro and gold diverged.

DATA WATCH -- The fourth-quarter 2004 report on the gross domestic product is due on Friday. It is expected to show that the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, after inflation, according to the consensus forecast gathered by Bloomberg News. That compares with a 4 percent pace in the third quarter.
 Because of recent worry about inflation, the G.D.P.'s price deflator will be watched closely. It is expected to rise 2.1 percent. Also on the inflation front, the government on Friday will release the employment cost index for the fourth quarter. It is expected to increase 0.8 percent, just below the third quarter's 0.9 percent. 
 Durable-goods orders for December, to be reported Thursday, are expected show a jump of 0.6 percent, down from 1.4 percent in November.

HEADLINE: Best Thing Since Sliced Bread

BYLINE: By GARY SANTANIELLO

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, Michele Bronson of Newtown was struck by an odd sight in her neighbor's driveway, an apparent apparition from the past: a dairy truck delivering milk to a box on the front porch. Upon investigation, she signed up for the service herself.
 ''It's the best thing since sliced bread,'' she said. ''It's very, very convenient, and the price isn't much more than what you pay for milk and orange juice at the grocery store. Even when we move to our cottage on the lake in the summer, I bring my little Marcus Dairy box and have the delivery switched to there.''
 Ms. Bronson is one of roughly 6,000 customers in Connecticut who get milk delivered to their homes, a practice that largely disappeared decades ago in the face of the economics of small dairy farms, the proliferation of supermarkets and convenience stores, and the increase in dual-income households. Connecticut has been losing about 15 dairy farms a year, according to the state Department of Agriculture. They now number fewer than 200, down from more than 5,000 in the early 1950's. 
 ''When I say I get home delivery of milk, people are amazed,'' said Marie Cassin, another Marcus Dairy customer. ''They can't believe there still is home delivery.''
 Only Marcus Dairy of Danbury, Mountain Dairy of Mansfield and Trinity Farm of Enfield still make home milk deliveries in Connecticut, and all also offer complementary products like juices, eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, sour cream and butter.
 A half-gallon of home-delivered milk from Marcus Dairy is $2.67. Mountain Dairy charges $2.24, Trinity Farm $2.65.
 ''It might be a little more than you pay at the supermarket,'' said Jim Stearns of Mountain Dairy, ''but part of what you're paying for is the service.''
 Not coincidentally, all three dairy farms are family businesses with roots in door-to-door service.
 Marcus Dairy, the largest home-delivery operation with 3,500 customers, traces its origins to the early 1900's, when the family patriarch, Harry Marcus, bought a small dairy farm in Litchfield County. Ultimately, the family consolidated operations at a new processing plant on Sugar Hollow Road in 1947, and now Harry's grandsons run the business: Michael Marcus is chief executive, Neil Marcus is president and Jeffrey Marcus is vice president.
 Marcus Dairy's delivery network extends as far east as Branford, as far north as Torrington and as far west as Putnam and Westchester Counties in New York. Six delivery trucks dedicated to residential accounts are on the road each day, five days a week.
 ''We've been in the home delivery business for as long as Marcus Dairy has been in business, which is probably why we're still in it,'' said Bill Fitchett, the dairy's general manager. ''It's part of our heritage.''
 Mountain Dairy has been selling milk since 1871, ''and the farm itself has been in the family since 1772,'' said Mr. Stearns, the ninth generation of his family to work at the dairy.
 In addition to Mr. Stearns, the corporate secretary, five other members of his family are among Mountain Dairy's 30 employees, not including two members of the 10th generation, a cousin's daughters, who work part time.
 ''We're proud of what we've accomplished, and we're proud we're still here,'' he said.
 Mountain Dairy maintains a herd of 600 cows, most of them at its plant on, naturally, Stearns Road. Its delivery area doesn't extend beyond a 15-mile radius, so its 2,500 customers and cows are virtual neighbors.
 ''Our milk,'' Mr. Stearns said, ''is delivered by the time other milk is processed.''
 Trinity Farm, by far the smallest operation of the three, was started in 1984 by Michael Smyth, who grew up working on his family's dairy farm across town. The home-delivery business tailed off in the 1970's -- ''Women went to work, so there was no one home to get the milk,'' he explained -- and the family eventually sold the land to developers.
 After working at other dairies, Mr. Smyth started Trinity Farm on 20 acres abutting I-91. His daughter, Bridget, started the home-delivery business in 1998, delivering milk in an old pick-up truck.
 Trinity Farm delivers to just 200 customers, ''but there's more demand than we can take care of,'' Mr. Smyth said. ''I'm running the farm at the same time, so there's not enough time to manage it properly.'' Still, he plans to add a few cows to the 45 Holsteins already in his herd.
 Despite its relatively small scale, Trinity Farm is the only dairy that delivers milk exclusively in glass bottles.
 ''For what we consider a premium product, it's the proper packaging,'' Mr. Smyth said. ''The milk doesn't pick up the flavor of the container, it stays colder, and it stays fresher longer with our resealable cap.''
 Marcus Dairy provides milk in half-gallon glass bottles upon request, but Mountain Dairy dropped the practice when its glass washer wore out. ''The glass bottles just required an inordinate amount of time and labor,'' Mr. Stearns said, ''so we've gone to all one-way packaging.''
 Home delivery accounts for 5 percent of Mountain Dairy's business, ''but there are some indications it's making a comeback,'' Mr. Stearns said. ''We pick up 50 to 100 new accounts a year.''
 The dairy does some radio advertising, promoting that it doesn't use artificial growth hormones on its herd, but mostly it relies on word of mouth.
 ''Whenever a new neighborhood springs up, people notice a neighbor getting home delivery,'' Mr. Stearns said, ''and then they call us.''
 Marcus Dairy, on the other hand, relies exclusively on its fleet of trucks (which display its 800 number and Web site address) and current customers to bring in new business. ''Our drivers are good salespeople, too,'' Mr. Fitchett said.
 Al Watson has been driving for Marcus Dairy for more than 20 years, and makes more than 100 stops per day on his routes. His day typically runs from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 A genial man who carries dog treats in a plastic bag, Mr. Watson said he encounters people at only one in 20 stops. Typically, he drives his compact, box-shaped truck into a driveway, gathers the items for the order from the back of the truck, kept cold by refrigerated plates, places them in a plastic crate and then carries them to a porch box at a side door.
 On average, the stops are five minutes apart, meaning Mr. Watson spends a large part of his day plying winding, hilly back roads. ''It's peaceful,'' he said. ''No pressure. And you see something different every day. There are a lot of deer out here, and I drive a lot of dirt roads.''
 One of his Newtown customers, Dorothy Schmidt, has been part of his route for more than 10 years.
 ''I had little ones, and one on the way, so I started getting home delivery for the convenience,'' she said. ''Now that my kids are 14, 12 and 9, I don't need home delivery as much, but it's nice knowing the fridge is always full. It's just one less thing to worry about.''
 She remembers Mr. Watson leaving little gifts of chocolate when his children were small, and she said she enjoys having a part in keeping an old-time tradition alive, but Mrs. Schmidt also has a practical reason to continue her home delivery.
 ''I know I'd regret it if I stopped getting milk at home,'' she said, ''because I know I'd still be the one making the last-minute trips to the store.''

HEADLINE: In Search of Affordable Child Care, New Yorkers Pool Their Resources

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

 BODY:
Mary Ellen Bettencourt and C.D. Clifford were new moms with a lot in common. Their sons, Robbie and Felix, were born days apart and were in the same baby yoga class. The mothers shared opinions about baby videos (O.K.), sugary juice (bad) and the gentrification of their Brooklyn neighborhood (the worst). 
 So when the women needed a way to save money on child care, they came up with what seemed like a natural solution: share a nanny. They pooled their money, their schedules and their anxiety about leaving their sons, now 17 months old, to return to work, and they hired one nanny to watch the two boys.
 ''A good nanny-share situation has a kind of team feeling to it,'' said Ms. Bettencourt. ''It's a real group project. We're all trying to make this work.'' 
 If the chatter at play groups, on online parenting networks and at child-friendly coffee shops is any indicator, nanny sharing is becoming an increasingly popular child care option for working parents. As child care costs rise and budgets strain, the era when a nanny dandled one family's child from infancy to grade school is waning, parents say.
 ''All of a sudden, everybody is looking for a nanny share,'' said Angela Secul, a part-time design consultant who works from her Harlem town house and shares a nanny with a family on the Upper East Side. ''I can't get a full-time nanny because my husband would kill me. It's perfect to have two or three days of a nanny, have the company and be home.''
 The arrangement, which tends to be most common among middle-class parents, seems simple at first, a parental version of splitting a cab or cramming two roommates into a one-bedroom apartment.
 Two to five families pool their money, children and time, and divide them among a single caregiver. The nanny earns more, and parents save by splitting the cost. Some nannies rotate from family to family during the week; others watch all the children at once.
 But it is not that easy. These little economies of scale can fall apart as parenting styles collide, schedules clash and harried nannies reach a breaking point.
 Sometimes, one family quits the arrangement, leaving the rest to pay more. Different families have different rules about meals, naps and television. Should the nanny do housework? When one family buys the nanny a gift, do the other families have to match it?
 One nanny share stumbled after the nanny fed a baby another mother's breast milk. The baby's mother called the doctor to ask if her child could have gotten sick from the milk, upsetting the other mother, who thought that her breast milk was being stigmatized.
 ''If the parents are flaking out and not bringing their kids and not treating the nanny well, the whole thing falls apart,'' said Lisa Cohn, an author of books on child care who lives in Oregon and has seen neighborhood nanny shares crumble. ''It can wreck friendships and relationships. It's very hot and emotional.''
 Because many shared nannies are undocumented immigrants who work off the books, there is no reliable data on how many families use them. A 2000 study by the Urban Institute, a policy research group, found that 12 percent of families in New York State use nannies, compared with 6 percent nationwide. Of that 12 percent, anecdotal evidence provided by members of nanny associations suggests that about one in five share their nanny.
 The practice has long been popular in Sweden and parts of the Pacific Northwest. But Barbara Young, a member of the Bronx-based Domestic Workers Union, an advocacy group, said that she first noticed interest in the idea in late 2001 when the city plunged into a recession following the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
 Parents said they could not afford a child care worker's average salary -- $10.43 per hour in New York State compared with $7.26 per hour nationwide, according to 2003 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two families sharing a nanny can typically save about $3 to $4 per hour or as much as $6,000 to $8,000 each year based on a 40-hour workweek.
 Ms. Bettencourt, who lives in Williamsburg, returned part-time to her Manhattan job where she taught reading to students with learning disabilities. A full-time nanny for Robbie would have been costly and redundant because Ms. Bettencourt was not working every day, she said.
 So Ms. Clifford, who recently moved from Williamsburg to Jackson Heights, Queens, would bring Felix to Ms. Bettencourt's apartment, and the nanny would watch him and Robbie together. Rather than paying two nannies $12 per hour, they paid one nanny $16 per hour.
 There were other ground rules. The boys were not allowed to eat sugary foods, and because Felix was gluten-intolerant, neither could eat wheat. If one parent came home late, the other would take both boys. 
 The boys quickly synchronized their routines and their behavior. They slipped into the same schedule for naps and meals. Robbie, who loves to play with balls, soon had Felix saying ''ball.'' 
 ''When you have your first child, it can be kind of frightening and daunting to find a caregiver in the city,'' Ms. Bettencourt said. ''It was reassuring to start that process with a partner. There's always anxiety and guilt when you're leaving your kid with another person. It's nice to share that.''
 Parents seeking to share nannies typically use the Internet to find other interested families, so every day, Web sites like Craig's List, craigslist.org, or Urban Baby, urbanbaby.com, crackle with offers. A lower Manhattan share group with ''flexible scheduling, reasonable rates.'' An Upper West Side family whose share partner is moving to New Jersey. A family in western Suffolk County who needs a shared nanny who drives.
 It can be a difficult jigsaw to solve, but after an afternoon of phone calls, e-mail messages and discarded drafts of schedules, Laurie Ulster of Pelham, N.Y., was able to knit together a nanny-share calendar that matched two nannies with her family and two others. 
 The two nannies spend part of the week at Ms. Ulster's house and the rest with the other families in Chappaqua, about 20 miles away. 
 Ms. Ulster, who works in Manhattan, said her 22-month-old son, Nathaniel, had thrived from spending time with the two women. One is boisterous and takes Nathaniel to the park, while the other is quieter and spends more time at home.
 ''The variety has been great for him,'' Ms. Ulster said. ''He can adapt to pretty much anything.''
 While sharing nannies makes sense for many families, Ms. Young, of the domestic workers union, said nannies considering that kind of job should think twice. Parents and nannies said nannies often take the shares as a last resort or take on a second family when longtime employers cuts their hours. The patchwork of families often adds up to 40 hours each week, but nannies can lose vacation time and job security.
 Julie Spodek, a shared nanny who works in Williamsburg, said the work is harder because everything is duplicated: meals, baths, naps, sets of toys. Twice the kids, twice the parents and twice the scheduling headaches. And woe to the family with only one Teletubbies toy.
 ''They both want it, they both grab it, and they're in tears,'' Ms. Spodek said. ''It's like a dance. You have to be flexible and very coordinated and very alert to the needs of the moment.''
 She was recently hired by Ms. Clifford and Ms. Bettencourt after their first nanny abruptly quit.
 Ms. Spodek, described by Ms. Clifford as a ''wacky Mary Poppins,'' seems altruistic in a city where child care is a competitive, fiercely economic scrimmage. Being in a nanny-sharing arrangement, she said, is a chance to give good care to families eking out a living. 
 Across the East River, there was a dose of economic reality. One recent afternoon, two nannies named Deann and Sheryl sat cross-legged on the polished living-room floor of an Upper West Side apartment, cooing at their charges and debating the merits of the nanny share. Sheryl watches one family's children. Deann is a nanny for three families. The women talked candidly on the condition that their full names not be used because they are being paid off the books.
 At first, Deann said, she bristled at the rotating arrangement, which takes her across Central Park once a week and up and down the Upper East Side on other days.
 ''I do not like running from east to west, north and south,'' she said. ''I said, 'Do you think I'm a puppet and you can just pull the strings?''' 
 But Deann said the families paid her for her travel time and as she got used to the job she grew attached to the three children she cared for. Sheryl scoffed at the idea.
 ''I would never do it,'' she said. 
 ''To live,'' Deann replied, ''you have to do whatever you can to survive. I have my bills to pay. I've got to do what I've got to do.''

HEADLINE: How a Painkiller Has Brought On the Pain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MILLER

DATELINE: WHITEHOUSE STATION 

 BODY:
THE world headquarters of Merck is tucked in the hills of horse country here, visible to only the most discerning of drivers zipping along Interstate 78. In many ways, Merck's hexagon-shaped building is a mystery to those who live in this wealthy suburb of 15,800, situated about 50 miles west of New York. 
 Here, after all, is a $68 billion company that for years has been one of the most respected and successful drug makers in the world, boasting thousands of patents and 60,000 employees worldwide. In recent years, its drug for river blindness was handed out in Africa -- for free. And after the tsunami struck Southeast Asia last month, the company pledged $3 million in cash and $7.4 million in much-needed supplies.
 ''Medicine is for people, not for profits,'' the chairman, George W. Merck, told Time magazine in 1950, and it became a slogan that to this day many in the company invoke. It is a place where people came to work, and stay. It is frequently ranked by business publications as one of the best workplaces in America; Fortune magazine has consistently identified it as one of the ''100 best companies to work.'' 
 But in recent years, cracks have begun to appear in that sterling facade. Merck has slipped further behind competitors like Glaxo SmithKline and Pfizer in terms of total market value. And in the last few months, those who work for the company have been roiled by a series of events that have cost it billions in sales and left it vulnerable to tens of billions of dollars in lawsuits. Trials could start in Alabama and Texas in a matter of months.
 ''Absolutely, we're concerned,'' said Frank L. Gatti, mayor of Readington Township, where Whitehouse Station is situated. 
 And with good reason. In the past few years, Merck has endured a triple whammy of bad news -- the expiration of five patents with no new promising moneymaker in the pipeline, a chilly climate for pharmaceutical companies, problems in accounting with Medco, a division of the company that had managed benefits, and then, in September, the bombshell: the announcement that the company was voluntarily withdrawing the pain-killing drug Vioxx after studies showed that doses of the prescription medication over a long period of time increased the likelihood of stroke and heart attack. 
 In November, following disclosures that the company may have been more aware of the problems with Vioxx than had been revealed, the beleaguered president, chief executive and chairman of Merck, Raymond V. Gilmartin, was called before the Senate Finance Committee to defend the company.
 ''Withdrawing Vioxx was consistent with an ethic that has driven Merck actions and decisions for more than 100 years,'' Mr. Gilmartin said, noting that his wife had used the drug up to the day it was pulled from the shelves. ''Merck puts patients first.''
 It may well have put patients first, but the profits did not hurt. Vioxx was introduced in 1999 and had been wildly successful -- with sales of $2.5 billion a year, although earnings had decreased in recent years because of safety concerns. When researchers started raising new questions about the affects of Vioxx in a study this fall, the company decided to pull the drug from the market. Since then, Merck's stock price has plummeted -- from a high near $50 a share in Februay 2004 to a low of $25 just after the announcement, costing the company $25 billion in market value. For now, the stock is hovering around $30 share.
 According to the company, 475 lawsuits involving Vioxx have already been filed, including 289 in New Jersey. Depositions could start in the state by March, when Mr. Gilmartin is likely to be called to testify in Atlantic County. Last November, the company was hit with a $120 billion lawsuit from New York State's public pension fund, among other stockholder suits. Federal law allows large investors that suffered a precipitous decline in stock value to take the lead in such lawsuits. 
 For Merck, it was harsh medicine indeed. In December, the company announced that in addition to 5,100 employees it was planning to lay off as a result of earlier restructuring, an additional 700 employees would lose their jobs. The company declined to say how many employees in New Jersey would be affected.

Repercussions Over Vioxx
 Already, the repercussions are being felt at the world headquarters here. 
 In the aftermath of the most recent layoff announcement, workers have begun making anxious calls to placement agencies. And over the holiday season, local business owners took notice of subdued company parties. In driveways and in diners around New Jersey, many have heard the worry from workers.
 ''There's a change in the tenor of the invincibility of Merck and the stability in the company even prior to Vioxx,'' said Ellie Cantor, president of CJ Resources, a pharmaceutical employee placement firm in Malvern, Pa. 
 A former researcher herself, Ms. Cantor said she and her colleagues lived in constant fear and awe of the company. 
 ''Merck was always considered the 800-pound gorilla in the corner,'' she said. ''People went there and didn't leave. I think it has tarnished the image of Merck. Market factors have tarnished the image. A lot of people have left Merck and went to J&J. I think there's much of an image that you don't go to Merck and stay there for the rest of your life.''
 In a way, Merck's biggest problem may be its success. Many in town, from the mayor to real estate agents and business owners, say that since moving here from Rahway in 1992, Merck has been a very good neighbor. And talk to anyone here long enough, and most will start sounding like defenders of an ailing sports franchise, often complaining that the company is being unfairly targeted.
 ''I just thought it was another political massacre against a company making profits,'' said Yvonne Schneider, a real estate broker for ReMax who has lived in town since 1951. ''It's weird, something like this gets out and it becomes a real plague. It's a domino affect.''
 Many point to the good deeds of the company. In the 1990's, Merck started an ambitious program in Readington, Linden, Rahway and Elizabeth, pouring $12 million into science and math programs in the public schools over the last dozen years. Someone like Cynthia Kennington wonders what would happen if Merck went away.
 ''If Merck crashed, what would happen to the school?'' asked Ms. Kennington, a real estate broker and mother of two school-age children who lives in the township. ''Because I know they've dumped so much money into our school system.''
 It is also the biggest taxpayer to Readington Township. Last year, the company paid $4.7 million, about eight percent of the total taxes collected.
 ''Obviously, they have a very large piece of property,'' said Mayor Gatti, ''and I'm sure they have plans for future offices, which would add to the tax base. Obviously, the issues with regard to their sales might delay those future plans.''
 Mr. Gatti and others here credited the company with a resurgence on Main Street. In the early 90's, anticipating growth in the area, a 500-home development went up off Route 22 named Lake Cushetunk Woods, where many Merck employees now live.
 ''I moved here in 1995,'' said Ms. Kennington, who counts a Merck employee as a neighbor. ''There wasn't a store open on Main Street. Just Cushetunk being there revitalized the town.''
 One of those Main Street businesses is a place called Whitehouse Gardens-New Leaf Florist. Standing behind the counter and smiling cheerily was Debbie Budd, whose life seems inextricably bound to Merck. As a horse owner, Ms. Budd and others use the company's drug, Ivermectin, to fight worms. Her husband, the owner of a moving company, won the contract to relocate the Merck offices from Rahway in the early 90's. 
 Today, Ms. Budd works at the flower shop, often making arrangements for company conferences, and frequently going to its headquarters and conference center, Dakin House, in Branchburg.
 As they sat around a back room, she and her colleagues talked about the giant drug maker and their flower business.
 Bernadette Mitchell, the co-owner of the shop who was putting together arrangements of Gerbera daisies, said she noticed a slowdown in holiday parties. ''Some things have been cut,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''Christmas things. It's not as big as it used to be.'' 
 Her partner, Ms. Budd, was quick to add: ''The nice thing about Merck is they've been very conscientious to support local merchants. I think everybody in the whole area is concerned about the whole thing.''

'Getting a Bad Rap'
 Roxane Smith, who was cutting stems, ventured into the discussion. ''I think they're getting a bad rap,'' she said. ''Everyone makes mistakes. I took Vioxx, I'm fine.''
 ''Are you sure? Ms. Budd joked. ''That twitch ''
 Merck traces its roots back more than 300 years and across the Atlantic Ocean, starting as a modest pharmacy by Friedrich Jacob Merck in 1668, in the German village of Darmstadt. By the late 1800's, the business had grown, and had begun exporting alkaloids to America. In 1903, the company opened a plant in Rahway with 20 employees. 
 There it remained for 90 years, transforming itself into one of the country's leading drug manufacturers. Last year, sales topped $30 billion.
 By the early 1990's, the company was looking to expand, and in 1992 moved its executive offices to a former dairy farm in the Appalachian foothills of Whitehouse Station, making an easier drive for many high-level employees who already lived in lush Hunterdon County or nearby. Locally, the move was met with enthusiasm. At the same time, the company transformed its newly vacant offices in Rahway into research facilities.
 Merck seemed poised for long-term success. But by 2000, it had become clear even to the company's chief executive that Merck had entered a new age in the pharmaceutical business.
 ''Merck today faces three major challenges as we pursue our strategy,'' Mr. Gilmartin told a conference of chief executives in Boston that January, ''patent expirations of four major medicines, an increasingly competitive environment, and cost containment in health care.''
 And he seemed to understand the ramifications. ''Many people are skeptical about our ability to offset these patent expirations,'' he went on. ''Most companies can't even handle the loss of one patent without suffering. ''But thanks to the productivity of our research --we have introduced 15 new medicines in five years -- we are confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth that is competitive with the other leading health care companies during this time.''
 Of course, Vioxx was supposed to be part of that growth. And now it has become an enormous albatross around Merck's neck. In October, the company estimated that its 2005 earnings would be 11 percent less than previously expected.
 Those who work at the company are understandably concerned. Many say that they chose Merck because of its stability, its benefits and its magnificent reputation.
 ''You tell people you work for Merck, they go 'Oooh,''' said one employee who requested anonymity. ''You tell them you work for Oracle and they go, 'Eh.'''
 But even before the Vioxx announcement, some say, matters had been deteriorating. 
 ''I think the Vioxx announcement was like kicking someone when they're already low,'' said a long-time employee in the manufacturing division who also declined to be identified. ''I think the morale was low with the first round of layoffs. But once that occurred I think the morale was worse. It was something I'd never seen.''
 Workers say that it has become hard not to notice the constant barrage of radio, television and Internet ads from lawyers seeking Vioxx users for clients in what will undoubtedly prove to be costly liability lawsuits, almost 500 of which have already been filed. ''Reprehensible'' is how one worker described the lawsuits.
 It is a nerve-racking time.
 ''I think it's natural to worry,'' said the worker, who also noted that despite the company's best efforts at reassurance by way of a daily corporate newsletter and other announcements, management has indicated that further layoffs may be necessary. 
 ''I think to be honest, the way it was told to us, there's always that opportunity for cost-cutting,'' the employee said. ''There's ways to cut costs to make things more efficient, and in doing so you don't need as many employees, so the door's always open.''

'We Acted Responsibly'
 At the same time, many employees are standing by the company's decision on Vioxx. ''I don't know enough about science,'' said another employee who declined to be named. ''I can only support what my company says over what some outsider says. From what I know, I think we acted responsibly.''
 C. Anthony Butler, a pharmaceutical analyst for Lehman Brothers, believes that many high-level Merck employees are getting whispers in their ears from other companies. 
 ''Competitors can easily sway an employee of a company by saying: 'Your options are under water. From an options standpoint, it could be in disarray.' If I were a competitor, I'd do the same thing.''
 For the worker in the manufacturing division, that comment is not idle talk.
 ''I think it's certainly on people's minds, the future of the company, the stock,'' the manufacturing employee said. ''Are people actively seeking headhunters? I think so.''
 For their part, Merck officials say they will fight the lawsuits vigorously and anticipate a resurgence in sales. 
 ''For many, many years Merck has worked with and supported the communities where we operate,'' said Chris Loder, a spokesman for the company. ''Here in New Jersey, we look forward to continuing to be a good corporate citizen well into the future.''
 Just how bad have things gotten? Some analysts are encouraging investors to pick the stock, reasoning that because it is doing so badly, the situation can only improve.
 Indeed, a recent article in Forbes magazine said: ''Merck has come off its lows in recent trading, but the stock was still one of the worst performers in the Dow in 2004. That's why I'm sticking with Merck as one of my picks in the Dow for 2005. It is hard for me to see these shares going much lower.''
 As Merck looks to right itself, it will probably encounter more pitfalls. A little more than a week ago, an advisory panel urged the Food and Drug Administration to reject Merck's joint application with Johnson & Johnson for an over-the-counter version of Mevacor, a popular cholesterol drug, which the company had hoped would boost sales. The panel deemed the drug too risky for average consumers, advice that the F.D.A. is likely to take. 
 At the same time, a potential successor to Vioxx called Arcoxia -- approved for use in 48 countries though not in the United States -- has come under increased scrutiny from some European nations along with similar drugs. Last week, the European agency chose not to stop the distribution of the drug, but instead said it would gather more information. 
 And the patent for Zocor, the company's popular anti-cholesterol drug, is up in 2006.

New Drugs Planned
 After several of Merck's most promising drugs failed in late trials, some analysts feared that the company's struggles could continue. For now, it is pinning its hopes on new drugs intended to combat diabetes, sleeplessness and cervical cancer.
 What all this means for Merck, Whitehouse Station, and New Jersey remains to be seen. But on a recent afternoon at Spiotta's, a bar and restaurant about 10 feet from the Whitehouse train stop, Jessica Driscoll was relaxing and working on a word puzzle. The lunch crowd had departed, and a few salesmen were sitting at the bar watching the news. 
 For six years, Ms. Driscoll has worked the bar and tables at Spiotta's -- a favored spot for Merck employees -- but lately she has noticed a drop in business.
 Looking out across the empty dining room, where she has begun hearing discouraging words from the workers, she said, ''It's slowed down a lot.''

HEADLINE: A Chinese Leader Is Honored From Afar

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
It was a memorial service that organizers hoped would be the perfect tribute to Zhao Ziyang, the former leader of China's Communist Party who died last week in Beijing.
 There, in the corridor outside, were grainy photos of Mr. Zhao with the likes of Deng Xiaoping and Henry A. Kissinger. There, in the overflow audience of more than 200 mourners, sat Li Lu and Liu Gang, two of the top student leaders during the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989. And there, too, were some of Mr. Zhao's former advisers, delivering testimonials in Mandarin about Mr. Zhao's commitment to economic and political reform. 
 It was the perfect tribute, perhaps, but for the location: the basement of a hotel in Flushing, Queens, rather than a huge square or grand hall in Beijing.
 Mr. Zhao died last Monday at the age of 85, 15 years after he was purged and placed under house arrest on the orders of Mr. Deng for publicly supporting pro-democracy student protesters in Tiananmen Square. He had been prime minister, general secretary of the Communist Party and a principal architect of the economic changes that transformed China in the 1980's. Yet his death was barely mentioned by the official press.
 Only in recent days has the Chinese government decided to hold a low-key funeral service, not the pomp of a full state memorial service usually expected to honor top officials.
 Some Chinese are using memorial services outside the country as a substitute for expressing both their admiration for Mr. Zhao and their frustration with how political reform has lagged far behind economic reform. And in the Western Hemisphere, no memorial has had as many faces from China's turbulent political past, arguably, as the one that was held yesterday at the Sheraton La Guardia East hotel in Flushing.
 It was, on the one hand, a reunion of sorts for some of China's leading intellectuals and dissidents who now live in the United States. But since many young Chinese have scant memories of Tiananmen and Mr. Zhao, the reunion may have also been a little bittersweet; the last chance, in the foreseeable future anyway, for these dissidents to come together in so public, so political and so visceral a way.
 ''He's probably the only person you can call a national hero since 1949,'' said Mr. Li, a student leader who escaped China after the troops crushed the protesters, and now is a venture capitalist in Manhattan. ''We have to immortalize him if the nation has any hope of any revitalization.''
 Those dissidents who have made their way to America are now doing a variety of things, from pursuing doctorates in political science (like Wang Juntao, a former adviser to Mr. Zhao who is now at Columbia) to running businesses (like Gao Han, a writer who now owns an ice cream store in Bayside, Queens).
 But many still stay in touch and follow the latest pro-democracy murmurings from China. In fact, many ''are still obsessed with political reform and want to keep the memory alive,'' said Merle Goldman, a research associate at Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research, and author of the coming book, ''From Comrade to Citizen: The Struggle for Political Rights in China.''
 So when Mr. Zhao died, the response among Chinese living abroad was immediate and dramatic. Mr. Gao, for one, quickly set up a Web site in honor of Mr. Zhao (http://crdea.net/zzy) that, accompanied by Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, has so far drawn more than 23,000 visitors who have contributed 4,000 testimonials. About 60 percent of those visitors are from Hong Kong, while 20 percent are from the United States and 10 percent are from China, Mr. Gao said.
 Word spread quickly, as well, about yesterday's memorial, both through the Chinese-language press in New York and the Internet. And despite the snowstorm, the service attracted a standing-room-only crowd.
 Sometimes, tensions flared. At one point, a woman who was trying to tell the mourners to take their seats confronted a man who she thought was an agent of the Chinese government sent to report on the proceedings.
 ''I know you are with the public security bureau! I can tell!'' she said.
 With the exception of Councilman John C. Liu of Queens, who made his remarks in English, the tributes were in Mandarin and often referred to the Tiananmen uprising. And most of the speakers were older intellectuals like Yan Jiaqi and Chen Yizi, who either were advisers to Mr. Zhao or have long been associated with the democracy movement.
 But there were also a few who said that they were from Taiwan, and admired Mr. Zhao, too. For all the statements made during the service, and at a news conference afterwards, perhaps the most eloquent tribute to Mr. Zhao was on display at the front of the room.
 There, garlands of flowers draped a black-and-white photo of Mr. Zhao. And there, next to the portrait, was a simple Chinese idiom, ''Gao feng liang jie,'' used to describe someone who is believed to be noble, decent and principled, an aphorism that Mr. Chen, an economist, repeated in his remarks.

LOVE AND HATE IN JAMESTOWN: John Smith, Pocahontas, and the Start of a New Nation, by David A. Price. (Vintage, $14.95.) ''English America was a corporation before it was a country,'' Price explains in this absorbing new history of Jamestown (founded 1607) and its hero, Capt. John Smith. Organized and financed by the Virginia Company of London, Jamestown became the first English-speaking colony to survive in North America, largely because of Smith's Machiavellian leadership. Price recounts Smith's encounters with native Indians, especially the ruthless Chief Powhatan and his daughter Pocahontas, as well as the history of Indian-English relations in Virginia after Smith left.

THE STORIES OF RICHARD BAUSCH. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $15.95.) The 42 stories in this engaging collection investigate the heart and soul of the American male: the hope and disappointment in the lives of spouses and lovers, parents and children. ''There is much life being confided here,'' our critic, Sven Birkerts, wrote, ''and Bausch has the timing and the moves to pull us in.''

THE SORROWS OF EMPIRE: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic, by Chalmers Johnson. (Owl Books/Holt, $16.) Johnson, an Asia scholar and former consultant for the Central Intelligence Agency, maps the global spread of American military and economic control, and warns of a possible future state of perpetual war and economic bankruptcy. John Newhouse, in IMPERIAL AMERICA: The Bush Assault on the World Order (Vintage, $13), argues that President Bush's foreign policy, by replacing diplomacy with a doctrine of preventive war, has done more to imperil America than to enhance its security. In BUSH IN BABYLON: The Recolonisation of Iraq (Verso, $12), Tariq Ali, a Pakistani-born novelist, depicts the American occupation of Iraq as the latest misguided attempt at colonization.

WOLVES OF THE CALLA: The Dark Tower V, by Stephen King. Illustrated by Bernie Wrightson. (Scribner, $18.95.) The Mid-World quest to prevent the destruction of the Dark Tower continues in this fifth volume, which follows the gunslinger Roland Deschain and his trekking ''ka-tet'' (roughly, those joined by destiny) as they defend Calla Bryn Sturgis, a village teeming with twins, from soldiers dressed as wolves. Our reviewer, Andrew O'Hehir, praised the novel's ''everything-but-the-kitchen-sink enthusiasm'' and its ''disparate styles of popular narrative, from Arthurian legend to Sergio Leone western to apocalyptic science fiction.''

OVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe, by Laurence Bergreen. (Perennial/ HarperCollins, $15.95.) This superb real-life thriller follows the voyagers who sailed west from Spain in 1519 in search of the Spice Islands. They returned in 1522 with a better understanding of the Pacific, but only after losing their captain, Magellan, most of their 260-member crew and four of their five ships.

HEAVENLY DAYS, by James Wilcox. (Penguin, $14.) Wilcox's deliciously funny novel, the fifth to be set in fictional Tula Springs, La., revolves around an addled, stubbornly forgiving heroine who's always the last to know.

JUNG: A Biography, by Deirdre Bair. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $19.95.) Scrupulously fair to its subject, Bair's comprehensive biography of the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung (1875-1961) is all the more impressive because of the family's tight grip on Jung's archives. Bair, the author of biographies of Samuel Beckett and Simone de Beauvoir, shows less interest in Jung's ideas than in his life: he treated Thornton Wilder and briefed federal agents on the psychology of Nazi leaders. Our critic, Robert S. Boynton, called this a ''balanced, full-blooded portrait of a tremendously flawed and divisive figure.''

GROWING UP FAST, by Joanna Lipper. (Picador, $15.) Lipper's exhaustively researched book grew out of her short documentary film on the difficult lives of six teenage mothers from Pittsfield, Mass., where various systems (schools, welfare, social services department) repeatedly fail them.

ANJA THE LIAR, by Thomas Moran. (Riverhead, $14.) Moran's disturbing novel explores the moral climate of post-World War II Europe through a collection of fragile characters, including Anja, a girl from Krakow longing to be invisible after six years as a Nazi informer. Ihsan Taylor

HEADLINE: Rapid Rise and Fall for Body-Scanning Clinics

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
For a brief moment, Dr. Thomas Giannulli, a Seattle internist, thought he was getting in at the start of an exciting new area of medicine. He was opening a company to offer CT scans to the public -- no doctor's referral necessary. The scans, he said, could find diseases like cancer or heart disease early, long before there were symptoms. And, for the scan centers, there was money to be made.
 The demand for the scans -- of the chest, of the abdomen, of the whole body -- was so great that when Dr. Giannulli opened his center in 2001, he could hardly keep up. ''We were very successful; we had waiting lists,'' he said. He was spending $20,000 a month on advertising and still making money.
 Three years later, the center was down to one or two patients a day and Dr. Giannulli was forgoing a paycheck. Finally, late last year, he gave up and closed the center. 
 Dr. Giannulli's experience, repeated across the country, is one of the most remarkable stories yet of a medical technology bubble that burst, health care researchers say.
 It began as a sort of medical gold rush, with hundreds of scanning centers, with ceaseless direct-to-consumer advertising, and with thousands of Americans paying out of pocket for the scans, which could cost $1,000 or more. 
 It ended abruptly with the wholesale shuttering of businesses. 
 CT Screening International, which scanned 25,000 people at 13 centers across the nation, went out of business. AmeriScan, another national chain, also closed. So, radiologists say, did another company that put scanners in vans and traveled to small towns in the South.
 The business's collapse, health care researchers say, holds lessons about the workings of American medicine. 
 It shows the limits of direct-to-consumer advertising and the power of dissuasion by professional societies, which warned against getting one of these scans. The tests, they said, would mostly find innocuous lumps in places like the thyroid or lungs, requiring rounds of additional tests to rule out real problems, and would miss common cancers, like those of the breast.
 It also shows the workings of the medical market -- when insurers refused to pay, requiring customers to dig into their own pockets for the tests, scanning centers found themselves cutting prices to compete. Within a year, some centers said, prices fell to less than $500 from $1,000 or more.
 And when the flow of patients began to slow, the combination of low prices and reduced business spelled doom. It turned out that the assumption by radiologists -- that people would be willing to pay for early detection by scans and that there was a huge market waiting to be tapped -- were not true.
 The scans were something new in American medicine -- not like traditional screening scans, mammograms or colonoscopies, for example, in which patients are overseen by their doctors. People requested these scans on their own. They paid on their own, with no hints that insurers would start picking up the bill. And the reports came to the customers, not their doctors.
 Some proponents said the scans would enable people to take their health care into their own hands. Critics said the scans were medical nightmares, a powerful medical technology gone out of control.
 But few anticipated the precipitous reversal of fortune for the scanning centers.
 In Seattle, Dr. Scott Ramsey of the University of Washington got a federal grant to study patients at nine centers, expecting to enroll 1,500 patients. Last year, when he was ready to begin, only two centers were left, and he enrolled just 50 patients.
 He also hoped to do a study with a company, ScanQuest, on the scans' effectiveness. ''We were in negotiations when they suddenly stopped returning our phone calls,'' Dr. Ramsey said. It turned out that ScanQuest had gone out of business.
 ''I've never seen a market for a medical technology collapse so completely,'' Dr. Ramsey said.
 Whole body scans erupted onto the national scene in 2000, helped in large part by Dr. Harvey Eisenberg, the owner of HealthView, a scanning center in Newport Beach, Calif. Oprah Winfrey, scanned there, featured him on her show, and his competitors watched with interest as he got attention on morning shows like ''Good Morning America'' and ''Today'' as well as in newspapers and magazines like USA Today and Men's Health. Soon, HealthView's waiting list grew to eight months. 
 The HealthView Web site quoted Whoopi Goldberg (''The most comprehensive health exam that exists. I love them.'') and William Shatner (''I'm sending everyone I know.''). And the site told how the concept worked: a person could call and make an appointment and have a simple 15-minute scan, while lying fully clothed on a table.
 The powerful X-ray scanner could look inside the entire body, ''from the neck to the pelvis,'' the advertisements said. ''Almost all diseases uncovered at asymptomatic stages can be modified, reversed, or cured,'' HealthView promised. Those whose scans found nothing amiss could have peace of mind.
 Soon, competitors opened their own center, CT Screening International, just across the street. Dr. Michael Brant-Zawadzki, a radiologist who was medical director there, remembers those heady days after the center opened in 2001.
 ''The place was jammed,'' Dr. Brant-Zawadzki said. ''We had a waiting list, and we were competing with the poster boy of whole body scanning.'' 
 In just two years, CT Screening International had grown to a national chain. ''It was a very big operation, and it was an enormously rewarding operation,'' said its chief executive, Dr. Richard Penfil. 
 The business also appealed to radiologists who normally send reports to doctors but have little contact with patients. At the scanning center, though, Dr. Brant-Zawadzki sat down with patients and discussed their scans. ''It was very pleasurable,'' he said, adding that ''it also promoted the value of radiologists to those patients.'' 
 Dr. Carl Rosenkrantz, a radiologist in Boca Raton, Fla., said the business had another appeal -- it promised radiologists a good living without being on call at a hospital and even without necessarily being present at the scanning center.
 ''The goal in life seems to be to try to figure out some way where you don't have to go to the hospital, where you don't have to take calls,'' Dr. Rosenkrantz said. ''Radiologists saw this as a cash business and a way out.''
 Academic medical centers also got into the business, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard, which opened Be Well Body Scan. The center is owned by the Beth Israel Radiology Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports the hospital's radiology department.
 Dr. Max Rosen, medical director of the scanning service, says he has saved lives, finding a lung cancer at a stage when it could be removed, he says, and a heart problem that led to a bypass operation. 
 At Yale, Dr. Howard Forman, an associate professor of diagnostic radiology and management, said he had felt pressure from hospital administrators to explore the possibility of offering whole body scans to healthy people. He could see why. ''From a profitability standpoint, you would go in this direction.'' But he and his colleagues resisted. ''There is no evidence that the scans are good medicine,'' Dr. Forman said. 
 Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the National Institutes of Health's office of disease prevention, said: ''For every 100 healthy people who undergo a scan, somewhere between 30 and 80 of them will be told that there is something that needs a workup -- and it will turn out to be nothing.'' 
 The same arguments were made by the American College of Radiology and the Food and Drug Administration. 
 Radiologists at scanning centers protested. It may not be proven that scans save lives, but on the whole, they said, the benefit of finding something like cancer early outweighs the problem of finding harmless nodules and having additional tests to rule out disease.
 But that is not how the scans were portrayed by professional societies, the scanning center doctors say.
 ''We were perceived as charlatans, bilking the population,'' Dr. Brant-Zawadzki said. He was chagrined, he said. 
 ''Did I see it coming?'' Dr. Brant-Zawadzki asked. ''No, obviously, I didn't.''
 Dr. Edmund Lundy, director of the Health Test Scan Center in Boca Raton, says his center is one of the few in his area still in business. The trick, he said, is to market to doctors, persuading them to send him patients. When doctors do the referring for diagnostic purposes, health insurance often pays, he adds. 
 So Dr. Lundy sponsors seminars for doctors and hired former drug company representatives to visit them. 
 ''I think there's a real place for doing this,'' Dr. Lundy said of the scans. ''And I think there's a population that wants to have it done. It's a question of who's going to pay for it.''
 Be Well Body Scan at Beth Israel has also stayed in business, even though it sees just 25 patients a week, not nearly enough to make a profit, said Dr. Rosen, its director. 
 ''We don't want to lose money, but we don't have stockholders; we don't have investors,'' Dr. Rosen said. When he is not using the scanner to screen patients, he said, he uses it on patients who need diagnostic radiology.
 Dr. Eisenberg, the man who scanned Ms. Winfrey, has a new company, Body Scan International. These days, instead of seeing patients in an office, he takes the scanner to them, operating out of a van that, on a recent day, was parked in a rundown parking lot beside a runway at John Wayne Airport in Irvine, Calif. 
 Dr. Eisenberg was unavailable for an interview, but one of his employees, Don Ark, said that since last May, the van has gone to two sites, an Indian reservation and an electrical workers' union.
 As for Dr. Giannulli, he has moved on to other things. He founded a company, CareTools Inc., which sells software for medical record keeping to doctors' offices. That, he says, is the new frontier in medicine.

HEADLINE: Courting the Lazy and the Klutzy

BYLINE: By ROBERT JOHNSON

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla. 

 BODY:
MOST people aren't inspired to perspire. And no part of American retailing is more determined than the sporting goods industry to see that inertia, no matter how comfortable, doesn't dominate consumers' lives.
 But the makers of sports gear know all too well the public's couch-potato tendencies. ''Obesity in America: It's a Huge Problem,'' screamed the headline on an industry report distributed last week at the annual convention of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association in Orlando, Fla., attended by 40,000 industry professionals.
 The sporting goods market has been growing slowly, partly because of a sluggish overall economy and partly because of stalled participation rates for many sports; the sales gain of 4 percent last year, to $52 billion, was the highest since 1997, the association said. To jump-start the market, companies are introducing a vast array of products, from battery-powered skateboards to practice baseballs that are engineered to curve when thrown. The industry's new theme might be summarized this way: ''Look, these activities are easier than they seem. Buy this new stuff and get an edge with less effort.'' 
 That is a hard sell, because buyers of sports gear have realized some bitter truths, said Tim Sitek, a sports marketing consultant in the St. Louis area.
 ''They bought expensive running shoes and still got sore feet,'' Mr. Sitek said. ''They bought state-of-the-art compression workout shorts and still got achy muscles at the health club. They spent lots of money to equip their kids for everything from Little League baseball to roller hockey, and most of the stuff is piled up in the garage gathering dust.''
 Old tennis racquets are regulars at garage sales, and Mario Rizzo of Santa Barbara, Calif., is among those who say, ''I just never could play that game.'' So he has invented ''Tamball,'' in which tambourinelike devices with wrist straps are used to bash that elusive yellow ball. The tambourines' surfaces are stretched leather, and they sound like drums when the ball is struck. ''A lot of noise, a lot of action,'' Mr. Rizzo said. 
 He advocates playing across a volleyball net, without letting the ball bounce on the ground. That allows for competition at places like the beach. A set of two Tamball racquets and a ball sells for $49.95. 
 Clearly, the industry's philosophy is one of unrelenting optimism. Dennis Naville, president of the Swiss company that offers Kangoo Jumps bouncing boots, said the footwear was ''a revolutionary exercise product that I predict will come to lead its entire category,'' though he readily acknowledged that as of now, there was no measurable sales category for it. The boots are priced at $229 a pair at www.kangoojumps.com, and they resemble ski boots with attachments on the bottom that look vaguely like tank treads. The flexible plastic treads are governed by Mr. Naville's patented spring, which allows wearers to bounce along in what he calls the ''world's lowest-impact'' form of aerobic exercise. Schutt Sports of Litchfield, Ill., introduced its DNA football helmet, which sells for $160, about five times the price of most such headgear. Schutt's marketing manager, D.J. MacLean, said the DNA helmet was not named for the body's famous microscopic strands of genes. ''It means different, new and advanced,'' he said. The helmet has what he described as a newly improved internal padding system to reduce the impact of blows to the head. 
 Products that help keep adults and children out of the emergency room are just as popular as those that promise improved performance, said Mr. Sitek, the industry consultant. He noted that an estimated one-third of American children did not participate in team sports. ''Parents have enough concerns when their kids try several sports and don't like them,'' he said. ''That's expensive enough. But if the child gets injured, that's even more expensive, and it's scary, too.''
 Taking the fear out of paintball -- a game played with guns that fire hard paint-splattering balls at 300 feet a second -- is viewed as potentially lucrative by Franklin Sports Inc. of Stoughton, Mass. Paintball play wars are largely the province of adults and older teenagers; most commercial paintball playing sites, which offer targets, hiding places and even leagues, do not allow younger children to participate. But Franklin's new Battle M.A.X. line of low-impact guns, which fire soft plastic pellets to ''replicate the paintball experience,'' are aimed at lowering the acceptable playing age and drawing more customers. A Franklin promotional video lauds paintball as an ''addictive game'' but laments that many potential players have been excluded by its danger.
 Expected to make their debut in September, the $99 Battle M.A.X. guns have a hand-pump air mechanism that shoots projectiles at just 50 feet a second. The soft plastic bullets can be fired dry or dipped in paint. They still sting a little if they strike bare skin, and each gun comes with a protective mask.
 To broaden the game's appeal to backyards and to imitate the commercial paintball places, Franklin is offering a line of targets, as well as air-filled plastic castles and command posts to help create a variety of war zones. Bill Best, who designed Battle M.A.X., said that furnishing a typical backyard for the game would cost about $200. Franklin will also offer a line of gloves, pads, ammo harnesses and color-coordinated team vests to identify opposing players. 
 For young baseball pitchers who find a distinctly limited supply of batters willing to lean over home plate while they warm up, there is the new Bullpen Buddy from David Ross, a Las Vegas inventor and former college baseball player. Selling for $59.95 at www.pitchersworld.com, Bullpen Buddy is a 5-foot-tall air-filled batter in pinstripes. He can bat from either side of the plate while facing the mound, by virtue of a detachable head. 
 But why isn't Buddy bigger -- more like the muscular Barry Bonds? ''We have tried several prototypes, and this was the most popular,'' Mr. Ross said. ''One we started out with was 6-foot-8 and had huge arms.'' Too intimidating for some pitchers, perhaps, he speculated. But Buddy is tough, Mr. Ross said: ''You can't make him pop by hitting him with the ball. I took a baseball bat to him in my backyard and he didn't break. I don't know what the neighbors thought.''
 Maybe they didn't notice because they were watching sports on television. Some people in the industry say that if you can't budge couch potatoes, at least you can sell them something more expensive to sit in. That might be the new Ultimate Sports Chair recliner, priced at $2,000, from Bass Industries Inc. in Miami. 
 ''We're licensed to use the colors and logos of all the college teams,'' said Paul Baron, chairman emeritus, as he relaxed at the show on a red-and-black suede University of Georgia lounger. The logos vary, but every chair has a built-in cup holder on each arm. ''All sports fans drink,'' Mr. Baron said with the confidence of a man who doesn't need a consumer focus group. ''This we know.''

HEADLINE: Sure, Come Back to the Nest. Here Are the Rules.

BYLINE: By DALE BUSS

 BODY:
LAUREN ZIEJA, a store security manager in Pompton Lakes, N.J., lives where she always has: with Mom and Dad. They don't ask her to pay rent, for groceries or any other household expenses. Therefore, Ms. Zieja, 28, socks away $600 to $1,000 a month toward an eventual departure from the roost. 
 Last year, she sprang a nice surprise on her parents: a hot tub. ''It's certainly nothing we asked for,'' said her mother, Clarice Zieja, 54. ''It was her way of saying, 'Thanks, Mom and Dad.'''
 The Ziejas are hardly alone in having offspring living in the family home well into post-collegiate adulthood. The Census Bureau says 50 percent of all 18-to-24-year-olds were living at home in 2003; for 18-to-34-year-olds, it was 27 percent. Chubb Insurance says it has noticed an 11 percent increase in the number of 21- to 25-year-olds on parents' auto insurance policies in the past two years. 
 Many factors may be at play, including what many experts call post-9/11 insecurities -- as well as parents' compassion for children who may be recovering from the breakup of a romance. But many people say the main reasons for the growing numbers are economic. In some cases, the returning offspring, sometimes called boomerangers, may be struggling to pay off college loans or having trouble finding jobs that can cover housing costs. And their parents are often at the peak of their own earning power and can afford to take them back in.
 ''My parents want me to be set for the long run, which is why they're helping me now,'' said Nicole Dahman, who is living with her parents in Louisville as she pays off debts from four years at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. ''If they were just pushing me out on my own already, that would hinder my opportunities.''
 In fact, Ms. Dahman, 23, is in the middle of a life stage that can be considered ''emerging adulthood,'' said Jeffrey J. Arnett, a developmental psychologist at the University of Maryland. ''Almost all of these kids are less dependent on their parents than they were as adolescents,'' he said. ''But most still have some financial dependence on their parents, and nearly all will until they're about 30.'' Health and auto insurance costs alone may make some dependence inevitable. 
 The best of these parent-child relationships are built on some financial rules, or at least on some expectations, that encourage responsibility: A child who is unemployed must try to find work. One who has college debts must strive to pay them off. A graduate student has to hit the books hard. Gainfully employed children should pay rent -- or some amount for parents to set aside for them -- or invest for their own future. 
 ''Lots of parents want to look the other way,'' said Doug Charney, a senior vice president of the Charney Investment Group of Wachovia Securities in Harrisburg, Pa. If that happens, he said, children don't build self-discipline or learn responsibility. 
 ''If you're a parent, and you're cleaning out your gutters while your 20-something is in the basement playing Madden football and eating pizza all day, that's not a pretty picture,'' said Randall Flanery, an expert on family studies at St. Louis University, referring to the popular video game.
 In the Hlebiczki family, of Fort Thomas, Ky., Louis, 26, Elena, 24, and Nadia, 22, all live with their parents and two younger sisters. While one older sister works full time as a marketing assistant and the other teaches high school math, Louis is finishing a business management degree at Northern Kentucky University. He is also working three part-time jobs.
 For a time, Mr. Hlebiczki (pronounced la-BIT-skee) was the only sibling who paid rent, at $750 a summer -- imposed whenever he wasn't in school mainly as an incentive for him to stick with his classes. His parents, Louis and Helen, put that money into an account to help him finish college. He also says he contributes to his church, to the Special Olympics and to other charities.
 ''I hear from my friends who are out on their own who aren't keeping up with their own financial expectations,'' he said. ''I don't have to deal with that, and it's a nice advantage.''
 For the Hlebiczkis, having so much grown-up humanity in just 2,000 square feet of space can become complicated. For example, the younger Louis ends up subsidizing his teenage sister's allowance through a bookkeeping arrangement created by his father, an industrial engineer, to ensure equitable responsibility for a broadband Internet connection. And parking logistics are difficult for the family's six vehicles.
 COURTNEY WITTER, 28, came home to Seargentsville, N.J., two years ago -- broke and fighting lupus, an autoimmune disease, after living and working in New Zealand for five years. Her financial obligations are largely restricted to payments of $250 a month for her health insurance and $300 a month for her car. She has also saved about $2,000 toward the $6,000 or so she figures she needs to get her own apartment, maybe next year.
 With her immune condition stabilized, Ms. Witter is working for her father's industrial marketing and publishing company.
 ''I like to think I give him a cut rate in pay because he pays the rent for me,'' said Ms. Witter, who has a psychology degree from Connecticut College. ''And I try to contribute financially in my own way with groceries and being generous with gifts. But my parents love having me here, especially after seeing me only three times in five years.''
 Her father, Andrew Witter, agreed. ''Every now and then, Courtney will make mention of how much she appreciates it,'' said Mr. Witter, 60. ''If I never heard it, I'd probably bring that up sometimes.''
 In the Zieja family in New Jersey, Lauren's brother, Ryan, 24, is finishing college -- and also living at home. He helps out around the house -- along with his father, he recently installed his own bedroom in the basement -- though he sometimes saddens his mother by smoking.
 ''I've tried to quit, but it's hard,'' he said. ''But it's only $30 a week."
 More and more marketers, in fact, are trying to figure out how they can avoid such sensitivities while also tapping into the significant disposable income enjoyed by some adult children who live with their parents. They're maneuvering toward targets like Shannon Doung, 25, an ad agency representative who was living at home with her mother in Redwood Shores, Calif., last May when she decided to spend $3,000 on a three-week vacation in Greece -- a trip she believed was therapeutic, because her father had died in February.
 Marketers have already broken the code in Japan, where the boomeranger trend is older. ''The Japanese kids in their 20's and 30's that live at home are the ones with the big plasma TV's in their rooms and the top-of-the-line cars,'' said David Morrison, president of Twentysomething, a marketing firm based in Philadelphia. 
 Mr. Morrison and others said young American adults would keep boomeranging, even in a recovering economy. ''The expectation is already filtering down to the high-school level,'' he said. ''They've seen neighbors or siblings do it, and they've seen that everybody makes it.''

QUICK READ
If you are a parent sharing the nest with a 20-something child, here is some financial advice to consider:

HEALTH INSURANCE
Many policies cut off dependents if they have graduated from college or are over 25. If your child has a job that offers no insurance, decide who will pay for it -- or run the risk that he or she will be uninsured in the event of illness.

AUTO INSURANCE
Multicar discounts usually make it cheaper for a child to stay on his parents' policy, but consider having him pay his share.

FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS
If you require your child to pay rent, you may want to set a lower amount at first, then raise it gradually. If your child is looking for a job, don't let the search become an open-ended excuse for staying in your home.

NEST EGGS
Don't assume that by using your own savings to support your adult children, you are guaranteeing that they will support you in the future.

Seeking Faster Iraq Training
The retired four-star Army general sent to Iraq to assess operations there has concluded that the American military must accelerate and strengthen the buildup of Iraqi security forces, a task that will require assigning thousands of additional Army advisers to work directly with Iraqi units, said senior defense and military officials. 1

Two American soldiers were convicted on court-martial charges related to the shooting death of an Iraqi woman who was working with them as an interpreter. One soldier was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and the other of being an accessory after the fact. 14

With Iraq's election on Jan. 30, people here still have strikingly different views on the vote, with the disparities apparently based on the country's durable fault lines of ethnic and religious affiliation. 1

Praise for Palestinians
Israel and the United States praised the effort by the new Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to halt rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli civilians as more Palestinian policemen were sent to patrol Gaza's borders. 10

This summer, the Israeli government intends to clear out every last settler in Rafah, a much-battered border town, and that pullout could set off a frantic land rush by impoverished Palestinians. 10

Secret Domestic Security
Elite military forces are conducting special counterterrorism missions in support of civilian agencies in the United States under a top-secret plan updated after the Sept. 11 attacks. The units were among the 13,000 people providing security for President Bush's inauguration. 1

Governors' Medicaid Concern
America's governors are struggling for a grip on mounting Medicaid costs, and some are squeezing providers and chipping away at services. Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida may have the most far-reaching plan, which would allow private companies to decide the scope and extent of services. 25

Hubble Rescue in Jeopardy
A much-anticipated service mission to extend the life of the Hubble Space Telescope could be jeopardized by a White House plan to eliminate funding for it from NASA's 2006 budget request, according to government sources. 25

A Medical Bubble Burst
The promise of CT scans began as a sort of medical gold rush, but it quickly became one of the most remarkable stories yet of a medical technology bubble that burst, health care researchers say. 1

HEADLINE: The Crafty Attacks on Evolution

 BODY:
Critics of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution become more wily with each passing year. Creationists who believe that God made the world and everything in it pretty much as described in the Bible were frustrated when their efforts to ban the teaching of evolution in the public schools or inject the teaching of creationism were judged unconstitutional by the courts. But over the past decade or more a new generation of critics has emerged with a softer, more roundabout approach that they hope can pass constitutional muster. 
 One line of attack -- on display in Cobb County, Ga., in recent weeks -- is to discredit evolution as little more than a theory that is open to question. Another strategy -- now playing out in Dover, Pa. -- is to make students aware of an alternative theory called ''intelligent design,'' which infers the existence of an intelligent agent without any specific reference to God. These new approaches may seem harmless to a casual observer, but they still constitute an improper effort by religious advocates to impose their own slant on the teaching of evolution. 
 The Cobb County fight centers on a sticker that the board inserted into a new biology textbook to placate opponents of evolution. The school board, to its credit, was trying to strengthen the teaching of evolution after years in which it banned study of human origins in the elementary and middle schools and sidelined the topic as an elective in high school, in apparent violation of state curriculum standards. When the new course of study raised hackles among parents and citizens (more than 2,300 signed a petition), the board sought to quiet the controversy by placing a three-sentence sticker in the textbooks:
 ''This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully, and critically considered.''
 Although the board clearly thought this was a reasonable compromise, and many readers might think it unexceptional, it is actually an insidious effort to undermine the science curriculum. The first sentence sounds like a warning to parents that the film they are about to watch with their children contains pornography. Evolution is so awful that the reader must be warned that it is discussed inside the textbook. The second sentence makes it sound as though evolution is little more than a hunch, the popular understanding of the word ''theory,'' whereas theories in science are carefully constructed frameworks for understanding a vast array of facts. The National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious scientific organization, has declared evolution ''one of the strongest and most useful scientific theories we have'' and says it is supported by an overwhelming scientific consensus.
 The third sentence, urging that evolution be studied carefully and critically, seems like a fine idea. The only problem is, it singles out evolution as the only subject so shaky it needs critical judgment. Every subject in the curriculum should be studied carefully and critically. Indeed, the interpretations taught in history, economics, sociology, political science, literature and other fields of study are far less grounded in fact and professional consensus than is evolutionary biology. 
 A more honest sticker would describe evolution as the dominant theory in the field and an extremely fruitful scientific tool. The sad fact is, the school board, in its zeal to be accommodating, swallowed the language of the anti-evolution crowd. Although the sticker makes no mention of religion and the school board as a whole was not trying to advance religion, a federal judge in Georgia ruled that the sticker amounted to an unconstitutional endorsement of religion because it was rooted in long-running religious challenges to evolution. In particular, the sticker's assertion that ''evolution is a theory, not a fact'' adopted the latest tactical language used by anti-evolutionists to dilute Darwinism, thereby putting the school board on the side of religious critics of evolution. That court decision is being appealed. Supporters of sound science education can only hope that the courts, and school districts, find a way to repel this latest assault on the most well-grounded theory in modern biology.
 In the Pennsylvania case, the school board went further and became the first in the nation to require, albeit somewhat circuitously, that attention be paid in school to ''intelligent design.'' This is the notion that some things in nature, such as the workings of the cell and intricate organs like the eye, are so complex that they could not have developed gradually through the force of Darwinian natural selection acting on genetic variations. Instead, it is argued, they must have been designed by some sort of higher intelligence. Leading expositors of intelligent design accept that the theory of evolution can explain what they consider small changes in a species over time, but they infer a designer's hand at work in what they consider big evolutionary jumps. 
 The Dover Area School District in Pennsylvania became the first in the country to place intelligent design before its students, albeit mostly one step removed from the classroom. Last week school administrators read a brief statement to ninth-grade biology classes (the teachers refused to do it) asserting that evolution was a theory, not a fact, that it had gaps for which there was no evidence, that intelligent design was a differing explanation of the origin of life, and that a book on intelligent design was available for interested students, who were, of course, encouraged to keep an open mind. That policy, which is being challenged in the courts, suffers from some of the same defects found in the Georgia sticker. It denigrates evolution as a theory, not a fact, and adds weight to that message by having administrators deliver it aloud. 
 Districts around the country are pondering whether to inject intelligent design into science classes, and the constitutional problems are underscored by practical issues. There is little enough time to discuss mainstream evolution in most schools; the Dover students get two 90-minute classes devoted to the subject. Before installing intelligent design in the already jam-packed science curriculum, school boards and citizens need to be aware that it is not a recognized field of science. There is no body of research to support its claims nor even a real plan to conduct such research. In 2002, more than a decade after the movement began, a pioneer of intelligent design lamented that the movement had many sympathizers but few research workers, no biology texts and no sustained curriculum to offer educators. Another leading expositor told a Christian magazine last year that the field had no theory of biological design to guide research, just ''a bag of powerful intuitions, and a handful of notions.'' If evolution is derided as ''only a theory,'' intelligent design needs to be recognized as ''not even a theory'' or ''not yet a theory.'' It should not be taught or even described as a scientific alternative to one of the crowning theories of modern science.
 That said, in districts where evolution is a burning issue, there ought to be some place in school where the religious and cultural criticisms of evolution can be discussed, perhaps in a comparative religion class or a history or current events course. But school boards need to recognize that neither creationism nor intelligent design is an alternative to Darwinism as a scientific explanation of the evolution of life.

HEADLINE: 'A Great Calamity Has Come Upon Us'

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
BY 1934, it was not hard to make the case for Social Security. The Great Depression had devastated employment, pensions, the stock market and savings. Many older Americans, and their beleaguered children with families of their own, found themselves suddenly and shockingly in economic freefall. 
 ''A great calamity has come upon us, and seemingly no cause of our own,'' declared a 69-year-old architect, one of millions of Americans who wrote to President and Mrs. Roosevelt, pleading for help. ''It has swept away what little savings we had accumulated and we are left in a condition that is impossible for us to correct.'' 
 As Congress begins a debate over the future of Social Security -- whether to allow Americans to put some of their Social Security taxes in private investment accounts -- the relevance of this history will be a matter of fierce dispute.
 Isn't it time, many Republicans argue, to reinvent a Depression-era program for a more financially savvy generation that trusts, rather than fears, the market? Or, as Democrats assert, are Republicans ignoring a cautionary history that highlights the value of a guaranteed government benefit?
 Even in 1934, historians say, it was not easy to resolve the political tensions over what an individual could and should accomplish on his own, and what Americans could do better together.
 Roosevelt, his labor secretary, Frances Perkins, and the other architects of Social Security tried to construct a peculiarly American form of social insurance, one that recognized the strain of rugged individualism that runs deep in the national psyche. 
 Roosevelt insisted that the new program not look like a dole, his aides later explained; rather, it should resemble a private insurance plan, tied to an individual's contributions in their working years. ''You want to make it simple, very simple,'' Roosevelt told his aides, Perkins later wrote in a memoir. ''Just simple and natural nothing elaborate or alarming about it.'' Along the way, the New Dealers set aside the idea of adding national health insurance to the package, assuming that it would come later. (It never did.)
 Even so, Perkins wrote that when she went before Congress to present the plan, Senator Thomas Pryor Gore of Oklahoma had a pointed question.
 '''Isn't this socialism?' he asked me. My reply was, 'Oh, no.' Then, smiling, leaning forward and talking to me as though I were a child, he said, 'Isn't this a teeny-weeny bit of socialism?'''
 David M. Kennedy, the Stanford historian and author of ''Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War,'' said that he found it paradoxical that the current debate over Social Security ''is being couched in terms of individual ownership and privatization of the system, when those kinds of ideas deeply informed the way the original Social Security system was put together.''
 In fact, while the movement for social insurance and old-age pensions had been building for years, it took a depression to overcome resistance to it. ''It's not an accident that only in the context of that protracted trauma did we get such a departure from our notion of laissez-faire, rugged individualism,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 The trauma for the elderly of that era can hardly be overstated. As W. Andrew Achenbaum, a historian at the University of Houston, put it, ''The Depression destroyed every mechanism that had existed for covering the vicissitudes of old-age dependency.''
 Before the creation of Social Security, some Americans had private or state pensions, but most supported themselves into old age by working. The 1930 census, for example, found 58 percent of men over 65 still in the workforce; in contrast, by 2002, the figure was 18 percent. 
 The elderly also relied heavily on their families. ''Children, friends and relatives have borne and still carry the major cost of supporting the aged,'' the Committee on Economic Security, the Roosevelt administration panel that developed Social Security, reported in 1935. ''Several of the state surveys have disclosed that from 30 to 50 percent of the people over 65 years of age were being supported in this way.''
 The Depression swept this world away. Many of the elderly could no longer find work. Those who had been lucky enough to have a pension or some savings saw them disappear. And many who relied on their children saw them buckle under the strain. 
 ''I am in no position to do the right thing for my mother,'' one woman wrote to Roosevelt. ''I thought as long as I lived there was no need to worry about her being taken care of, but I never dreamed of a depression like we have had.''
 Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College, reviewed 15,000 letters sent to the Roosevelts for his book, ''Down and Out in the Great Depression: Letters From the Forgotten Man.'' He said that many who wrote to the Roosevelts asked for a loan, not a handout. 
 A 72-year-old man wrote, ''I have worked hard all my life, and bad luck has overtaken me in my old days, and I wanted to see if you could help me get a little relief, so I can get me a team and to make a crop this next year.'' He added, ''You know that I need it or I would not ask for it.''
 Roosevelt sent his Social Security plan, which included unemployment insurance, to Congress in January 1935, and by August he was able to sign it into law. Some New Dealers chafed at its limits, but the law was widely seen as a moderate alternative to the more radical proposals -- like a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly -- that were stirring then from the grassroots.
 ''We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life,'' Roosevelt declared. ''But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.''
 Today, opponents of partially privatizing Social Security say the guaranteed benefits of a traditional social insurance program are still the best way to protect against the hazards and vicissitudes of life, that the balance struck by Roosevelt and the New Dealers, in short, was just right.
 But advocates of private accounts argue that it is time to think anew, just as Roosevelt did.
 ''We are all children of F.D.R.,'' Representative Bill Thomas, the conservative Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, declared last week, underscoring, perhaps unwittingly, the great pragmatist's enduring triumph.

 BODY:
JUST outside the little shopping district is the blue and gray hulk of the shuttered Shoreham nuclear plant, like the brooding ghost of a vanished industrial civilization. To the south is Brookhaven National Laboratory, with its own tortured environmental history. Farther east, in Southold, officials are stewing because they were not notified about license renewal hearings for the Millstone nuclear plant, across the Sound in Connecticut, but close enough that they worry about evacuation plans. Then there's Plum Island and its ominous, obscure research, the dispute over the Cross Sound Cable to Connecticut, the long struggles over preserving the Long Island Pine Barrens.
 Nowhere in the New York area, it seems, is there such a pervasive buzz of environmental alarm coexisting in such a bucolic setting as on Eastern Long Island, particularly here on the North Shore. And the buzz was more like a car alarm at 2 a.m. last week, when more than 60 environmentalists, civic leaders and others gathered at Shoreham, the nation's only nuclear plant that was built but never allowed to fully open, carrying signs reading, ''Broadwater: The Shoreham of a New Decade.'' 
 Whether it is and whether it can be stopped as Shoreham was remains to be seen. But it's clear that the proposal for Broadwater, a huge terminal for liquefied natural gas that would be built in Long Island Sound, has once again guaranteed that the Island's environmental politics will be running at full tilt.
 This is a proposal that would probably generate some controversy in many other places as well. Broadwater Energy, a partnership formed for the project by TransCanada Corporation of Calgary and Shell U.S. Gas and Power of Houston, an affiliate of the Royal Dutch Shell Group, is proposing to build what could become the first offshore liquefied natural-gas facility.
 The gas plant, a floating structure resembling an ocean tanker and permanently moored to a tower anchored to the bottom of the Sound, would be 1,100 feet long, 180 feet wide and up to 100 feet above the waterline. Tankers would enter the Sound, deliver natural gas, cooled to 260 degrees below zero to make it liquid and thus denser and easier to store and transport.
 At the station, the liquid would be warmed until it becomes a gas again. Then it would be sent through a new 25-mile-long pipeline connected to the existing Iroquois pipeline and on to Long Island, New York City and Connecticut.
 Critics have already raised many health, safety and environmental issues, citing some catastrophic accidents at existing facilities and on tankers. And here in a town founded in 1671, where businesses tend to have names like the Duck and the Daisy, Andrew's by the Pond, and the Hickory Swings, the project, even nine miles offshore, seems to many an alien idea.
 ''It's too close,'' said Linda Mathews, who moved here from Queens after Sept. 11 and works at the Hickory Swings, a music and video store. ''Especially when you think of the terrorists, it's like a bomb waiting to go off.''
 FOR all the technical, environmental and safety issues, the opponents' case may rely on something similarly visceral -- whether the project is consistent with the way that people want the Sound to be. 
 The executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, Adrienne Esposito, said the project set a horrible precedent toward industrializing the Sound. ''What this does is change the Long Island Sound from an open natural resource into commercial real estate,'' she said. ''We don't feel we should be the generation that sells off the Long Island Sound in small portions -- it's not ours to give and it's not theirs to take.''
 The project director, John Hritcko Jr., said the health and environmental issues were overblown and any risks were limited to the immediate site and could not possibly warrant any kind of broader evacuation. He said the project was in the early stages of a full environmental review and cited a December 2004 study by Sandia National Laboratories, a Department of Energy center in New Mexico, which said the location nine miles from shore would not endanger communities on Long Island.
 ''The fact that someone has a home on the shoreline and doesn't want to see it does not offset the benefits this will bring in terms of getting energy costs under control, helping to keep the air clean and providing a healthy, vibrant economic future,'' he said. 
 The final decision on the project will be made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after reviews and permit applications before many federal and state bodies. Never underestimate the chances of a global energy giant, but in Suffolk County, the critics have played this game with great skill in the past and are geared up to do it again. 
 The executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, Richard Amper, said two dozen groups were on board as opposed to the project, with about two dozen more soon to join them. ''Long Island doesn't have the need, doesn't get the benefit and takes all the risk,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Woman Sought in Boston Threat Is Already in Custody

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
One of the Chinese citizens sought for questioning in connection with an unspecified, unconfirmed threat against the city of Boston has been in United States custody for more than two months, the F.B.I. said on Saturday.
 Mei Xia Dong has been located in a Customs and Border Protection detention facility in the San Diego area, the F.B.I. said in a statement on its Web site. 
 It said Ms. Dong, identified earlier this week as a man, is a woman who was arrested on an immigration violation on Nov. 11. 
 Ms. Dong has been in custody ever since.
 The F.B.I. said she had paid an undisclosed sum to human smugglers to be brought into the United States through Mexico.
 ''It appears at this time that Mei Xia Dong's motives for entering the U.S. may have been for economic reasons,'' the F.B.I. statement said. 
 ''The investigation thus far does not tie her to any terrorist group,'' it said.
 Officials have said they are increasingly skeptical about the validity of an uncorroborated tip from an anonymous source that led to a terror alert in Boston on Wednesday.
 News media reports spoke of threats to explode a ''dirty bomb,'' which disperses low-level radioactive material, and the F.B.I. announced it was seeking to interview 14 people, most of them Chinese, in connection with the unspecified plot.
 But by Friday, Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts said that he was growing less concerned about the situation.
 Officials began to speculate that the tip was a hoax.
 The F.B.I. said that it was still interested in speaking with the remaining 13 people it identified this week.

HEADLINE: Still Waiting For Mammogram

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Rell's Treatment Highlights Hurdles for Screenings Faced by Many'' (Jan. 9): 
 Isn't it nice to be an elected official! I guess if I was the governor of Connecticut, I would be able to get a mammogram as easily. As a well-educated black woman, I have been waiting six months for a slot to have my mammogram. And this is after having surgery for a suspicious calcification (it was O.K., thank God) just two years ago. I have not been back for a follow-up appointment because this center does not send reminders and because I lost my insurance because of unemployment. Now that I have a job and insurance, it takes six months to get an appointment. 
 Between my mammogram and the four months to wait for an appointment with my gynecologist, I have plenty of time to work, and wait.

HEADLINE: An Economist's Perspective

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Are Spendthrift Americans Really the Problem?'' (On the Contrary, Jan. 9), raised several interesting points about savings, but economists use a different definition. For economists, the issue is whether financial savings -- the difference between household income and consumption -- have a real impact on the economy. 
 Sometimes they do not. When financial savings are used to buy houses or stocks and prices spiral, everyone feels richer but there is no real addition to investment. This seems to be what is happening now -- a bubble in housing prices.
 Government policy should be trying to increase real saving. Lowering taxes most for the wealthy as the Bush administration has done will not lead to increased real saving if it is used only to drive up housing prices. 
 In short, the question for policy is whether saving more increases real investment or lowers the trade balance. Historically low interest rates may have households currently feeling richer, but all the borrowing by consumers and government will have to be repaid. There may be much hardship as a result.

WRISTON, WALTER B.

 BODY:
 WRISTON--Walter B. On January 19, 2005 in New York City after an 18 month fight with pancreatic cancer. He was 85. Mr. Wriston was one of the most innovative financiers of our time. Mr. Wriston was born in Middletown, CT, and graduated from Wesleyan University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Following a year's service as a U.S. State Department officer and a four-year tour with the U.S. Army during World War II, Mr. Wriston joined Citibank in 1946. He held numerous positions at Citibank and served as chairman and chief executive officer of Citicorp for 17 years before retiring in 1984 after 38 years with the company. Mr. Wriston was a visionary who saw the future of the banking industry and the important role it would play in the global economy. He is credited with jumpstarting the electronic banking revolution with the introduction of the ATM as well as the expansion of Citibank's international franchise. At the time of Mr. Wriston's retirement, Citibank had bcome the world's largest bank with branches in 79 countries and its investment in computers and software surpassing $1.75 billion. An outspoken advocate on the need for the deregulation of the banking industry and the free flow of capital, Mr. Wriston was also a powerful voice in Washington and was named chairman of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board in 1982. Widely quoted for his forward thinking remarks, his most famous quote, ''Information about money has become almost as important as money itself,'' is inscribed in the lobby of the New York Library of Science, Industry and Business. Mr. 
Wriston served as a director of several corporations including General Mills, General Electric, J.C. Penney, Pfizer and ICOS. In June 2004, Mr. Wriston received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award. He is also the author of two books, In the Twilight of Sovereignty and Risk and Other Four-Letter Words. He is survived by his wife, Kathryn; daughter, Catherine Quintal; son-in-law, Richard Quintal; two grandchildren, Christopher and Barbara Catherine; and his sister, Barbara Wriston. Burial services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date in February. In lieu of flowers, contributions should be made to The Lust Garten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer, 1111 Stewart Avenue, Bethpage, New York 11714.

THEY MADE AMERICA
From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine:
Two Centuries of Innovators.
By Harold Evans with Gail Buckland
and David Lefer.
Illustrated. 496 pp.
Little, Brown & Company. $40.
 ABOUT 150 years into Harold Evans's formidable ''They Made America. From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine: Two Centuries of Innovators,'' any or all of these realizations may occur to you: 
 1. You are not worthy. 
 2. You are getting only half the story.
 3. Stop them before they innovate again.
 The first is actually a two-parter: you may feel both that you are not worthy to read this book and that you (presuming you live in the United States) are not worthy to share citizenship with the people discussed in it. 
 In ''They Made America,'' Sir Harold, the historian, publisher and journalist, follows up his 1998 volume, ''The American Century,'' with absorbing profiles of Americans whose inventiveness and industriousness changed the way human beings live. Read just a few of these portraits and you begin to become dismayed at what you yourself have accomplished in your time on the planet: that is, comparatively nothing. Certainly nothing that compares with the lasting transformations wrought by Samuel Insull (who put cheap electricity into many thousands of homes) or Samuel Morse (whose telegraph liberated communication from the constraints of geography). It's enough to make you throw the book down and plunge headlong into the development of time travel or climate control or anti-aging pills -- anything that might result in a legacy with some heft to it. 
 But your sense of inadequacy may also apply to the actual consumption of the book: you'll know that you are not putting nearly as much effort into reading it as was put into writing it. This is a rich, wide-ranging work, with 50 or so substantial profiles, numerous smaller portraits and anecdotes, an ''Innovators Gallery'' that nods to a hundred other important figures and lots of photographs and drawings. You can feel the Sir Harold History Factory working overtime to crank the thing out (Gail Buckland and David Lefer get a ''with'' credit on the cover), yet the presentation is of the reader-friendly, bite-size variety that encourages you to pick at the book as you would an hors d'oeuvre tray. That might prevent you from seeing the grand canvas that Sir Harold sees in this collection of lives. 
 His premise is that the United States has bred a subspecies of humans who have pushed the world forward through a frenzy of innovating; that America's geography, economic structure, political and educational systems and psychic makeup have combined to make the U.S. of A. an unrivaled wellspring. It's a proposition that feels as if it needs disputing, just for humility's sake. Surely Sir Harold's native England, for example, has produced many equally worthy innovations. There was all that great Beatles music, not to mention the, um -- well, lots of other stuff too numerous to catalog here.
 Anyway, Sir Harold's book singles out not mere inventors, but people who took a new thing or idea and put it to widespread practical use. ''Invention without innovation is a pastime,'' he writes. He also emphasizes that many of those he describes were not the first to come up with their gizmos, but the first to mass-produce them, market them, get them into the homes and lives of everyday folks. ''Originality is not the prime factor,'' he says, ''effectiveness is.''
 Once Sir Harold lays out the concept, the book becomes an entertaining second-guessing game for those who like that sort of thing. Certain innovators in his pantheon are givens: Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, the Wright brothers. But Garrett Augustus Morgan (the gas mask)? Ruth Handler (the Barbie doll)?
 Some of these odder choices appear to be an attempt by Sir Harold to balance the demographic ledger. (''I readily acknowledge that the book is light on the contributions of women, African-Americans and other minorities,'' he writes. ''It is because the history of innovation is light on them.'') If so, good for him, and in any case their stories are among the volume's most fascinating (as with Morgan, a black man who in 1916 rushed to the scene of a disaster on Lake Erie with his invention, saving many lives but going unacknowledged for years). Yet it does seem as if the closer Sir Harold gets to the present, the more suspect his choices become. Does the guy who gave us eBay (Pierre Omidyar) really deserve to be in a book with the guy who gave us electric lights?
 Regardless of the individual choices, the sheer length of this celebration of American innovation eventually generates a quiet but insistent internal backlash: dadgummit, we Americans haven't been that amazing. What about all the scoundrels? The embezzlers, the defilers of the landscape, the peddlers of dangerous food and cars? The same things that made the United States a place where innovation could thrive also made it the land of ''The Jungle'' and Pintos and Enron. 
 TOO much exposure to the glow of ''They Made America'' may generate another nagging suspicion as well: if many of these stories were told from another perspective, they would be evidence of why the United States is the Great Satan. Sir Harold's innovators filled needs, but they also generated demand -- for Model T's, for plastics (Leo Hendrik Baekeland), for Maidenform bras (Ida Rosenthal), for hip-hop (Russell Simmons). They helped create the consumer culture, and in parts of the world that is nothing to be proud of. It's easy to imagine someone in a far-off place reading this book's interesting account of Elisha Otis's elevators and seeing the germ of the World Trade Center disaster.
 Sir Harold, though, did not write this book to explore the dark half of American innovation. He takes it as self-evident that the world is a better place because people can listen to the radio, take photographs, fly, wear Levi's and get an M.R.I., and he's probably right. And his book is a compellingly written, nicely illustrated reminder of how much we in 2005 owe to some determined, risk-taking forebears.
 You may also find it, somewhat perversely, to be an argument for a moratorium on innovating. Somewhere along the journey from the steamboat (John Fitch) to the Google search (Larry Page and Sergey Brin), it may occur to you that innovations have morphed from being things that make life easier to being things that simultaneously make life easier and more complicated. 
 The steamboat? Sure, an improvement; much better than pack mules. The electric light bulb? You bet; simpler and safer and more reliable than flame. Air travel? Hmm -- flights to catch, luggage to lose. Venture capital (Georges Doriot)? Don't understand it. Biotechnology (Herbert Boyer and Robert Swanson)? Really don't understand it. Twenty-four-hour news (Ted Turner)? Too much information. 
 As Anthony Newley said: Stop the world! We need breathing space, a chance to sort out 200 years' worth of innovations, figure out where to put all this stuff, how to work it, what its implications are. Perhaps a century from now Sir Harold (having had his life prolonged by those anti-aging pills you invented) will write ''They Unmade America,'' about the heroic visionaries who showed us how to simplify.

HEADLINE: Birth of an Industry: IPod Loading

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
IT sounds like a line from a spam e-mail: Work from home! Low risk! Flexible schedule! Earn hundreds of dollars each gig!
 But an emerging group of resourceful entrepreneurs says there is no catch. The rising popularity of Apple's sleek iPod has created a new niche service: the professional iPod loader. There are housekeepers to tend homes and gardeners to tend landscaping. Why not iPod loaders to take care of music collections? 
 For $1 to $1.49 a CD, the professional loaders will embark on the time-consuming process of copying a music collection onto an iPod, often providing a digital backup copy as well. 
 ''It's a booming aftermarket of the iPod economy,'' said Bill Palmer, a 27-year-old entrepreneur who has created a nationwide network of iPod loaders called Loadpod. Each loader picks up the iPod and CD's at the client's home, then returns a fully loaded iPod in a few days. 
 The loaders say they are finding growing demand, especially after the holiday season, which increased the number of iPods sold to 10 million. Consumers are realizing that the digital wonder that was supposed to unify and simplify their musical existence actually eats up time, lots of it. Converting enough CD's to fill a 40-gigabyte iPod can take 60 to 100 hours, depending on the computer's speed. ''The prospect of spending all this time was daunting,'' said Nell Eckersley, a 35-year-old educator in Brooklyn, who was excited when she received an iPod for Christmas. Then she began converting her collection of 400 CD's. ''I spent all day Sunday doing it, and said, 'This is crazy,' '' she said.
 Hearing such frustration has inspired many would-be businessmen. College graduates, computer technicians and D.J.'s are setting up shop. The business is even attracting medical doctors. 
 ''I'm deeply in debt because of medical education and other things -- why not?'' said Jay Parkinson, a 28-year-old pediatric resident at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital in New York who recently started loading iPods in his spare time. He says he sits at his home computer for at least two hours every night anyway, so changing CD's while he is sitting there is a minimal burden. ''Why not just get paid to be sitting at home?'' Dr. Parkinson said. ''It doesn't take much effort on my part.'' 
 Hyung J. Chun, a 30-year-old cardiologist at Stanford, has started his own iPod business. With two other doctors, Dr. Chun invested $1,000 to buy a 100-CD changer to start his business, Feedmypod.com. ''Hopefully we can turn it into something that can generate revenue eventually,'' Dr. Chun said.
 Some are starting full-fledged small enterprises -- creating banks of computers, hiring hourly workers, and aggressively sending out direct- mail advertisements. Others are one-person shops, moonlighting in boxer shorts or multitasking with their laptops at their day jobs.
 Loading iPods is appealing because it is low risk, requires relatively little overhead and can be done from home or work. The only thing that is required is a relatively up-to-date computer and some computer knowledge. Marketing can be done on the cheap: online through the site Craigslist.com and Google, offline through neighborhood fliers and word of mouth. 
 ''The reason it's so good right now is you buy the computer up front and there is very little marginal cost,'' said Brian Stucki, a 24-year-old president of Las Vegas Technical Associates, who has six computers converting CD's day and night. For the overnight shift, he pays college students a quarter for each CD they load, and gives them an Xbox and a television for entertainment. 
 Mr. Stucki started his business with an aggressive marketing campaign, sending 5,000 postcards to every lawyer's and dentist's office, bank, real estate agency and gym he could find in Las Vegas. 
 An iPod loader can earn several hundred dollars for converting a large collection, but hour by hour, the money is modest. Transferring a single full-length CD takes five to nine minutes on a standard computer, which means that most computers can generate $6 to $12 an hour. Even a computer capable of transferring a CD in three minutes would generate no more than $20 an hour.
 But from the perspective of many customers, it's a bargain, especially for highly paid lawyers or executives. ''The guy makes $250 to $500 an hour and he spends the next three weeks just to get his stupid CD collection on his iPods,'' said Kris Shrey, who runs cds-dvds-wanted .com. Mr. Shrey says he makes his money on scale: he runs eight computers loading iPods. Among his clients is Ms. Eckersley of Brooklyn, who paid $213 to convert a portion of her collection.

A Collection.

 AT a time when neither a large national economy nor a modern military is required to produce and deploy a weapon that can destroy a medium-size American city, a good interrogator constitutes a better defense against catastrophe than soldiers or marines. No group of people in the defense establishment get to know the enemy better on a personal level than interrogators do. As the Abu Ghraib scandal reveals, some guards and interrogators can be sadistic ghouls; but many other interrogators could qualify as the most liberal people in the armed services since, for one thing, they have spent years studying the language and the history of their captives. As one Special Forces officer told me in Afghanistan, ''In order to defeat the enemy you first have to love him, and his culture.''
 Competent interrogation is less about breaking a prisoner down to learn a single fact than about engaging him in hours upon hours of conversation, and comparing his responses on seemingly irrelevant details with those of others revealed under questioning. It is about looking for one plot and finding another; or rather not finding a plot at all, but happening upon -- for example -- the travel patterns and safe houses of a group of Muslim terrorists of one nationality and deducing how that group differs from another. 
 Real interrogation is about finding shards of evidence in a desert, in which a vital fragment will come not from a high-level Qaeda operative, but from a midlevel functionary who spends weeks in captivity before anyone realizes his importance. In ''The Interrogators: Inside the Secret War Against Al Qaeda,'' Chris Mackey (the pseudonym of an Army interrogator) and Greg Miller, a Los Angeles Times correspondent, write that as a prisoner in Afghanistan reached for his glasses (by now long lost) when he went to examine a photograph, that ''absent-minded move'' alerted interrogators to the fact that he was ''accustomed to poring over documents.''
 Interrogators can use many tools that do not involve actual physical abuse. They spread rumors among detainees, wear them down through repetitive questioning and threaten to turn them over to other intelligence services known to employ torture -- all of which cause interrogators constantly to ask themselves where, exactly, does the slippery slope toward real abuse begin? Sadly, it is no use saying torture never works, because as the French authorities learned in Algeria, as the Filipinos learned with their own Muslim insurgents and as the Dubai authorities learned with a Qaeda terrorist, it periodically does work, and in some instances can possibly avert a major attack. While it is true that the threat of torture, as Mackey and Miller report, induces more anxiety among detainees than torture itself, that threat over time will carry little weight if it becomes widely known that the jailers have no record of following through. ''Fear is often an interrogator's best ally,'' the authors note, ''but it doesn't have a long shelf life.'' A captured Qaeda manual even advises Muslim prisoners that people in the West don't ''have the stomach'' for torture, ''because they are not warriors.''
 Machiavelli famously said that good men bent on doing good must know how to be bad. And because we all share a social world, he goes on, the virtue of a policy maker resides not in his moral perfection but in the communal result of his act. If one is not already ill at ease with such maxims, consider this: In the ultimate hypothetical case, if a terrorist with hard intelligence about an impending large-scale terrorist strike could be broken by torture, shouldn't it be used? That nauseating question forms the theme of ''Torture: A Collection,'' edited by Sanford Levinson, a professor of government at the University of Texas. What's most striking about these essays is that despite their abstract and theoretical content, they generally do not contradict the depiction of actual interrogators described by Mackey and Miller. The wall between the liberal campus and a conservative, utilitarian-minded military breaks down because the questions are so serious that few of this book's contributors want to engage in polemics, and few -- to their credit -- ever seem completely comfortable with their own conclusions.
 To follow Machiavelli further: it is not simply and crudely that the ends justify the means. It is that evil, if it is to be employed, should be used only to the minimum extent necessary, and then only to accomplish a demonstrably greater amount of good. As the Princeton professor Michael Walzer writes, ''It is important to stress Machiavelli's own commitment to the existence of moral standards.'' But knowing what that minimum extent is, and knowing with reasonable certainty that a greater amount of good will result, thwarts scholars and interrogators alike.
 The Harvard law professor Alan Dersho-witz argues for legally sanctioning torture in ''ticking bomb'' cases. ''At bottom, my argument is not in favor of torture of any sort,'' he says. ''It is against all forms of torture without accountability.'' His rationale is that in ticking bomb cases the idea that torture in some form will not be used is illusory, and the government should not be able to walk away from responsibility for it. That, in effect, would leave the interrogators with all of the legal and moral blame. Jean Bethke Elshtain, a professor of ethics at the University of Chicago, counters that torture is so extreme that it should remain ''tabooed and forbidden,'' and that any attempt to legitimize torture even in the rarest of cases risks the slippery slope toward normalizing it. Seeking a middle ground, Miriam Gur-Arye, a criminal law professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, argues that in the absence of a concrete terrorist threat, only a specific self-defense argument can justify force in an interrogation: it cannot be justified by the more general and utilitarian -- that is, Machiavellian -- argument of necessity.
 Interrogators themselves are not above such hairsplitting. After an intense discussion about how humane it would be to deprive prisoners of sleep, and just how much sleep deprivation constituted cruelty, Mackey came to the conclusion that ''if the interrogator followed the exact same regime -- slept, ate . . . and took breaks on the same schedule as the prisoner -- there was no way to argue'' that such treatment was cruel. There is even a name for an interrogator staying with a prisoner until one or the other of them breaks: it's called ''monstering.'' Double-teaming a prisoner, in which different interrogators take turns sleeping, was considered immoral, Mackey says. Because monstering was so hard for an interrogator to endure, it was used only when something important was at stake and the prisoner seemed close to breaking. One interrogator kept a prisoner in a booth for 29 straight hours. It was worth it, Mackey reports: the prisoner had been a translator for Osama bin Laden and disclosed a Qaeda plot to use the chemical agent ricin.
 But what if the prisoner hadn't confessed? Should he have been double-teamed for 48 hours and beaten? Such questions demand answers, and yet are unanswerable. My own experience covering the military suggests a different approach to the issue. As Mackey and Miller themselves note, the effectiveness of interrogators is regularly undermined by a host of problems that have nothing to do with torture. Rarely do military interrogators get all the language training they need. Their offices are understaffed. When they walk into an interrogation room they often lack vital information about the detainee that another agency in the United States government already possesses, and won't share. Embedded with Army Special Forces in Afghanistan a year ago, I was shocked by how a creaky bureaucracy was stalling the hunt for terrorists on the Pakistani frontier. An administration that dynamically addresses such problems will provide the public with a wider cushion of protection than one that stretches the boundaries of what constitutes physical abuse.
 No matter how wise those drawing up the guidelines are, however, the art of interrogation does not lend itself to micromanagement from above. Interrogators will forever be forced to make split-second decisions with grave life-and-death consequences. The way toward public safety and out of the moral abyss will come less from philosophy than from sturdy bureaucratic reform: correcting, for example, the broken reserve system that contributed directly to the abuses at Abu Ghraib. An interrogator armed with fluent Arabic and every scrap of intelligence the system can muster, who has mastered the emerging science of eye movements and body signals, who can act threatening as well as empathetic toward a prisoner, should not require the ultimate tool.

HEADLINE: The Ghost of Tiananmen Continues to Haunt China's Rulers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: Beijing 

 BODY:
LAST week, President Hu Jintao delivered a eulogy in Beijing's Great Hall of the People before 700 senior cadres and the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee. The next morning, the front page of The People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, extolled the ''outstanding achievements'' of the deceased.
 Such elaborate state ceremonies generally commemorate a figure of towering national importance, someone like Zhao Ziyang, who died Monday and led the Chinese government and ruling party through much of the 1980's. 
 It was Mr. Zhao, then Communist Party chief, who, just before the violent crackdown on June 4, 1989, appeared in Tiananmen Square, with tears in his eyes and a bullhorn in his hands, apologizing for having ''come too late'' and warning students to leave the square for their own safety. 
 But it was not Mr. Zhao who was being honored; it was an obscure official named Niu Yuru, from Inner Mongolia. Mr. Zhao got a one-line death notice deep inside The People's Daily, just above the weather map.
 In the end, the Orwellian exercise of obscuring the death of one man by commemorating another testifies to the continuing political reverberations of the suppression of the protesters in 1989. 
 But just as the party's heavy-handed efforts to define the Beijing uprising as a ''counterrevolutionary riot'' have helped elevate it to almost mythic status among older Chinese, so the campaign to eradicate Mr. Zhao's memory has enhanced his reputation among former colleagues, Chinese intellectuals and journalists, overseas dissidents, legislators in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and even policymakers in the White House.
 When Mr. Zhao died, the Foreign Ministry read a terse statement condemning him as a ''splittist.'' But supporters poured out e-mail eulogies to offshore Web sites and regional and foreign media outlets. He was called an architect of Chinese economic reforms, a visionary who favored sweeping political change, a man who opposed violence against the people. 
 ''Zhao Ziyang remains with us still, in the ongoing struggle for rights and democracy for the Chinese people,'' wrote Bao Tong, a former aide to Mr. Zhao and the most senior Chinese official jailed after the protests, in an essay released after Mr. Zhao's death. Mr. Bao himself lives under house arrest and nearly constant police harassment.
 The White House hailed ''a man of moral courage.''
 The Communist Party, from the first, has tried to rewrite the history of Tiananmen, which, to some, questions the party's very legitimacy. Mr. Zhao, for example, was purged after he opposed the use of force against the student protesters. He spent nearly 16 years under house arrest, and references to him vanished from the state-run media. 
 The party also clamped down on students. Today, many at Beijing University have only hazy notions of what happened at Tiananmen, and little to no knowledge of Mr. Zhao. 
 Nonetheless, his stature only grew in other parts of Chinese society, as details of his conflict with China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, leaked out, along with word that he had refused to write the traditional self-criticism and appeal for clemency. 
 HIS rising reputation survived the fact that more complete biographies have noted how Mr. Zhao, as a party official in Henan in the early days of Communist rule, ordered killings of landlords, possibly including his father. As premier in the mid-1980's, he toppled Hu Yaobang, a reformist party chief.
 Even some who admire Mr. Zhao say that the main impetus for China's economic and modest political liberalization came from Mr. Deng. And Wuer Kaixi and Wang Dan, leaders of the student movement now living in exile, wrote in separate op-ed articles in The Asian Wall Street Journal that Mr. Zhao's conversion to the cause of the protesters came only after he lost an internal party battle for control.
 But those are shades of gray in a propaganda battle waged in black and white for the nation's memory and loyalty. In effect, the Communist Party abandoned Mr. Zhao and the opposition adopted him, making him an unlikely icon of resistance. 
 It's not that the dissidents -- who lack even a common platform -- are about to topple the Chinese government. But Mr. Zhao and Tiananmen are two accusing ghosts the Communist Party does not seem to be able to exorcise.
 In an age when opponents operate virtually and borderlessly, the party may prove incapable of enforcing its version of history, of truth. If this generation of students doesn't know about Tiananmen and Mr. Zhao, the next may, or the one after that. 
 ''The whole Tiananmen affair is like a giant spring that the party keeps repressing,'' says Wu Jiaxiang, who worked in the party's central committee in 1989. ''But it is getting harder, not easier, and it is making the party tired.''

HEADLINE: Stadium Push by Bloomberg May Come at His Political Peril

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stood amid students in a library of a Brooklyn middle school that had just been removed from the list of the state's worst. The moment was meant to promote the mayor's election-year case that schools are getting better.
 But the photo opportunity was interrupted when one student switched to a less congenial topic, challenging him to explain why he was so intent on having a new Jets stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. The girl, whose question was answered by the mayor, told a reporter afterward that she had asked it because the stadium project was ''really stupid.''
 It was just one example of how Mr. Bloomberg's passionate devotion to the stadium is emerging as a dangerously soft spot in what even some of his critics acknowledge to be an otherwise formidable record. And it is becoming the first major flash point in the mayoral race this year. 
 His Democratic rivals are seizing upon it in their early stump speeches to paint the mayor as an out-of-touch billionaire stubbornly favoring fellow moguls, like the owners of the Jets, over average New Yorkers.
 At a forum on Monday for Martin Luther King's Birthday, one of the mayor's leading rivals, Fernando Ferrer, the former borough president of the Bronx, made criticism of the stadium a central theme of what amounted to his first major campaign appearance of the year. Representative Anthony D. Weiner and Council Speaker Gifford Miller did the same. And during an interview with Gabe Pressman of WNBC to be shown today, Mr. Ferrer called for a ballot measure on the stadium this fall. 
 A new Quinnipiac University poll of 1,027 registered city voters released on Thursday appeared to confirm what strategists for the mayor's rivals already believed: that New Yorkers are cool to the stadium plan. Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they opposed the stadium and more than a quarter said they would be less likely to vote for Mr. Bloomberg because of that issue.
 Yet for all that, the mayor has dug in, calling the opponents naysayers and, if anything, pushing harder for the stadium, which he says will create thousands of jobs, help draw the Olympics to the city in 2012 and transform a decrepit part of the Far West Side, the last vast stretch of relatively undeveloped land in Manhattan.
 Mr. Bloomberg's position is delighting opposing strategists, who consider his public zeal for the stadium -- requiring a $600 million public investment -- to be a real vulnerability. They say it crystallizes their plan to portray the mayor as a candidate whose priorities are out of step with those of average New Yorkers who have been asked to sacrifice so much since Sept. 11. 
 ''You have schools without toilet paper, teachers without supplies and a mayor who thinks taxpayers should put $600 million into the most expensive stadium in the world for a billion-dollar franchise,'' said Joel Benenson, an adviser to Mr. Weiner. ''As a political consultant, I cannot fathom for the life of me what on earth made them think this is so important.''
 The mayor was happy to answer as he traveled around the city last week. ''When people look back 10 years, 20 years, 30 years from now, they'll say, 'Thank God New Yorkers had the courage in tough times to go ahead and not listen to the naysayers, but to do the great things,''' Mr. Bloomberg told reporters on Tuesday at a day care center in Bushwick, Brooklyn. ''The naysayers didn't want Central Park, the naysayers didn't want the Triborough Bridge, the naysayers didn't want the subways and the water tunnels.''
 Asked on Thursday about the Quinnipiac poll -- conducted from Jan. 11 to 17, with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points -- Mr. Bloomberg called the stadium, ''arguably one of the most important economic things for this city.'' He also noted that the poll showed that a majority would support the stadium if its income would pay back the public investment in it, a case he is making aggressively.
 His vigorous support of the stadium plan has surprised some supporters, who would have been content to see him leave the issue in the hands of his deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, Daniel L. Doctoroff. Mr. Doctoroff founded the group most aggressively pushing to bring the Olympics to New York a decade ago. He made clear early on that he believed the stadium to be crucial to that bid, and he has pursued it with a zeal that identified him more closely with the plan in the public mind. 
 One of the mayor's prominent supporters, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of appearing to be helping Mr. Bloomberg's opponents, lamented, ''They're spending a tremendous amount of political capital on what is a peripheral issue in his administration.'' He added that he supports the stadium plan, but not at such a high political cost. ''If he wants to get elected on education, that's fair game because that's really important. If he loses a chunk of votes because of this stadium, it would be a crime.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides and associates have said that while he always supported the West Side redevelopment plan, his enthusiasm soared after he visited Athens during the Summer Games in August. ''He had been to Athens in 2001 and it was a different city,'' said the mayor's spokesman, Edward Skyler. ''It had been transformed by all of the projects put into motion by the Olympics.''
 Other people close to the mayor said that the nature of the opposition had led him to dig in: before his Democratic opponents joined the fray, a major source of criticism was Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden and sees the stadium as a potential competitor. The company hired a vice president who was a supporter of Mr. Ferrer's, and it backs a group that has spent millions of dollars on television commercials that attack the mayor and his plan. 
 Two associates said that in standing firm, Mr. Bloomberg was not obstinately driven to leave a physical legacy, as some have suggested, but was playing to type -- as he did with the smoking ban and his takeover of the Board of Education. They pointed to passages in his book, ''Bloomberg by Bloomberg,'' in which he recalls reveling in building his financial media empire, Bloomberg L.P., despite predictions that it could not survive. Describing conversations with doubters, Mr. Bloomberg wrote: ''Either they believe in me, trust me, and are willing to take the risk that I will deliver success, or they don't. It's that simple. There's no haggling. I don't negotiate.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides say they do not see his no-holds-barred approach to the stadium as a liability. If anything, they say, it fits his personal marketing as an anti-politician. ''Politics don't enter the equation with him,'' Mr. Skyler said. ''He sees things on the merits and the merits alone, and he's going to do what he feels in his heart is right.''
 In recent days, Mr. Bloomberg has spoken about the project as a sort of boroughwide jobs program. And his aides say they think plenty of people, including Jets fans and construction unions, support the project.
 Signaling one tack Mr. Bloomberg's campaign will be certain to take in responding to criticism of the stadium from the likes of Mr. Ferrer, Mr. Skyler said, ''I don't understand why some people are against creating jobs and economic growth, but that's for them to explain.''
 Of course the stadium issue could be stale come November, if its fate is decided by then. But Jen Bluestein, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ferrer, said it would remain a major issue until the bitter end.

HEADLINE: Bush Didn't Invent the Internet, but Is He Good for Tech?

BYLINE: By JAMES FALLOWS. 
James Fallows is a national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly. E-mail: tfiles@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
GEORGE W. BUSH probably won't be remembered as ''the high-tech president.'' The strongholds of the biotech and infotech industries, on the East and West Coasts, voted against him. If his State of the Union address next week, his fourth, is like the previous three, it will say next to nothing about the role of science or advanced technology in the nation's economic and social future. The symbol of Al Gore's relationship with gizmos was the early-model BlackBerry he wore on his belt. The symbol of Mr. Bush's was his tumble from a Segway computerized scooter in 2003.
 Yet the Bush administration could end up being known for some technology advances that occurred on its watch. I am speaking not only of purely private developments -- the renaissance of Internet-based businesses in this age of Google -- or of the heavy public spending for military and surveillance systems, which is creating a vast new antiterrorism-industrial complex. 
 Instead, as in many chapters of American technological history, some of the most significant innovations have been made where public and private efforts touch. In its first term, the Bush team made a few important pro-technology choices. Over the next year it will signal whether it intends to stand by them. 
 There is a long historical background to the administration's choices, plus a variety of recent shifts and circumstances. The history stretches to the early days of the republic, and the idea that government-sponsored research in science and technology could bolster private business growth. Progress in farming, led by the land-grant universities, demonstrated this concept in the 19th century. Sputnik-era science, culminating in the work that led to the Internet, did the same in the 20th century. 
 In the last two decades, this old idea has been dressed up with concepts like ''network economics'' and ''increasing return to scale.'' The results include the widely accepted understanding that the relationship of public science and private business is more important than ever. An environment in which the exchange of information is timely and inexpensive, rather than slow and costly, can foster the growth of many industries. 
 That sounds obvious. But it has political consequences. For one, it helps explain why the United States has been so fertile an incubator for tech companies, compared with most of Europe: government-sponsored information has been much cheaper here. (The United States government sells a CD set containing all weather readings taken in the last 50 years for $4,290; the German government data costs $1.5 million.) American dynamism also creates an ever-changing set of winners and losers. In fostering many new companies, the government often dislodges a few old ones; dealing with the resulting protests is each administration's problem.
 During President Bill Clinton's first term, the Office of Management and Budget issued a bold new document on balancing these interests. Although it reeked of ''bridge to the 21st century''-style futurism, it had actually been prepared and approved by the previous Bush administration and was released under President Clinton virtually unchanged. The document was called O.M.B. Circular A-130, and its crucial argument was that the government should distribute information as quickly, as broadly and as cheaply as possible -- technically, ''at no more than the cost of dissemination'' -- and that it should do so via the most modern channels available. Of course, that meant the Internet. 
 The Clinton-era information wars followed. Mead Data Central, then the owner of Nexis-Lexis, had enjoyed an exclusive contract to distribute data from S.E.C. filings, at steep prices. After a lawsuit and a change in policy, that filing data became available free, over the Internet. Struggles with other companies, with similar results, occurred in the Patent Office, the I.R.S. and other agencies.
 When the George W. Bush administration arrived, it faced a choice. Should it dump the A-130 policy like other detritus of the Clinton era, sparing more companies disruption like Mead's? Or should it push ahead, because of the assumed benefit of free information to the economy?
 In general, and perhaps surprisingly, it kept pushing. Compromises were struck and adjustments were made -- and information with any conceivable link to the ''war on terror'' was locked up tight. A continuing struggle concerns when and how the results of publicly funded medical studies should be made freely available -- a subject for another day. But for the most part, the federal government acted in the spirit intended by George H.W. Bush and put into effect by Mr. Clinton.
 One of the most important and contentious struggles, mentioned here last spring, appears to be turning out in a way that will burnish the Bush administration's pro-tech record. This is the ''fair weather'' controversy. The question at its core is whether the National Weather Service, which uses taxpayer funds to collect nearly all weather readings, will be allowed to make its information available through the Internet -- or instead required to sluice it all to commercial weather services, as the S.E.C. once did with Mead. 
 The famous Circular A-130 argued strongly for Internet distribution, as did a special study of the question by the National Research Council in 2003. The weather service went ahead with such sites -- and they have proved enormously popular. During the three months last fall when four hurricanes struck the South, weather service sites received nine billion hits -- breaking a government record of six billion hits on NASA sites in the three months after the Mars rover landing last spring. 
 From an interest in aviation, I often visit the weather service's marvelous Aviation Digital Data Web site, at adds.aviationweather.noaa.gov. Without a doubt, it has saved many lives by making it easy for pilots to understand where the dangers from icing, thunderstorms and turbulence are. Last fall, the government invited public comment on the weather service's new strategy and received overwhelming support. Just after the election, the service announced that it would officially embrace an open-information policy. 
 BUT the Commercial Weather Services Association, the industry's trade group, has complained that such sites violate an agreement from the pre-Internet era. By their argument, the taxpayers should continue to pay for all the weather balloons and monitoring stations -- but should not be allowed to get the results directly from government sites. 
 ''We feel that they spend a lot of their funding and attention on duplicating products and services that already exist in the private sector,'' Barry Lee Myers, executive vice president of AccuWeather, says of the weather service. ''And they are not spending the kind of time and effort that is needed on catastrophic issues that involve lives and property, which I think is really their true function.'' 
 He added that the weather service might have done a better, faster job of warning about the southern Asian tsunami if it had not been distracted in this way. Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, where AccuWeather is based, has supported the industry group's position. A spokesman said Mr. Santorum would introduce legislation to ''help'' the weather service ''continue providing meteorological infrastructure, forecasts and warnings, rather than providing services already effectively provided by the private sector.'' In other words, taking down those Web sites that the stealth High-Tech Administration has helped create.

HEADLINE: Deficits May Be Wearing Thin at the Fed

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THEY are only low-level rumblings, oblique signals of discontent that are stripped of any direct political threat.
 But as President Bush embarked on his second term last week, it was hard to escape the sense that his longtime honeymoon with the Federal Reserve may be ending. 
 The Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have arguably been Mr. Bush's most important economic supporters. Mr. Greenspan gave his blessing to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and, less enthusiastically, to those of 2003. 
 Despite Mr. Greenspan's reputation as a staunch opponent of fiscal deficits, he tiptoed around criticism of the soaring federal debt that Mr. Bush ran up in his first term and will almost certainly continue to run up in his second.
 Perhaps most important, the Greenspan Fed cut interest rates and showered the nation with cheap money to soften the recession of 2001 and to keep consumers spending through nearly three years of rising unemployment.
 But something new is afoot, and it is not just that the Fed is raising rates back to more normal levels. So far, a measured pace of rate increases has merely reflected the Fed's increased confidence that economic growth is on a steady course.
 The new element is a rising concern at the Fed about the nation's imbalances: the federal deficit, which hit $413 billion in 2004; a low and declining national savings rate; evidence of speculative behavior among investors and consumers; and the country's enormous trade and financial deficit with the rest of the world.
 In November, Mr. Greenspan noted that foreign claims on United States assets -- essentially the nation's net indebtedness to the rest of the world -- were now equal to one-quarter of the nation's gross domestic product. The trade deficit this year is almost certain to exceed $600 billion -- nearly 6 percent of the nation's economy, and still climbing.
 ''This situation suggests that international investors will eventually adjust their accumulation of dollar assets or, alternatively, seek higher dollar returns to offset concentration risk,'' Mr. Greenspan said. That, he continued, would make the cost of foreign debt ''increasingly less tenable.''
 To most economists, such comments are simply a statement of time-honored truth: a borrower who runs up huge debts will become a bigger risk to lenders and gradually have to pay higher rates. But Mr. Greenspan's comments also carried a warning: rising budget and trade deficits come at the price of higher interest rates.
 The Fed fired off another warning in the published minutes from its policy meeting on Dec. 14, saying, ''a number of participants voiced concerns about domestic and global financial imbalances.'' Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy, were said to believe that the odds of ''significant deficit reduction over the next few years were remote.''
 More surprising, the minutes said that some policy makers worried that the prolonged strategy of low rates might be fostering ''excessive risk-taking'' in financial markets and in the market for houses and condominiums. That sounded like a veiled reference to concern about a ''housing bubble,'' an idea that Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly shot down.
 A third veiled warning came on Jan. 13 from Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a speech to financial executives about risk management, Mr. Geithner suggested that investors had become too complacent about risks posed by global imbalances -- particularly those in the United States.
 Declaring that the current account deficit had reached an ''unprecedented scale,'' even as investors continue to demand very low risk premiums, Mr. Geithner warned that they had little buffer for unexpected shocks.
 ''The present fiscal trajectory entails an uncomfortable scale of borrowing and little insurance against possible adverse outcomes in an uncertain world,'' he said.
 In private sessions, Mr. Greenspan may well be warning Mr. Bush in blunter terms. The Fed chairman meets regularly with Vice President Dick Cheney and periodically with Mr. Bush.
 There is a rumor in Washington -- thus far unconfirmed -- that Mr. Greenspan warned the White House in mid-December that it would have to take more credible steps than it has so far to meet its goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.
 If true, the unspoken but inescapable threat would be clear: if the Fed wasn't satisfied, Mr. Greenspan could signal his lack of confidence in Mr. Bush's fiscal plan. Investors would be shaken and Mr. Bush's credibility would be damaged.
 What is certain is that the White House has started to signal tough cuts -- trimming as much as $30 billion over six years at the Pentagon -- and Mr. Bush has adjusted his rhetoric about the deficit.
 Where administration officials routinely called the deficits ''unwelcome but manageable,'' Mr. Bush and other top officials now describe deficit reduction as the cornerstone of their strategy for shoring up the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
 Complicating the chemistry between the White House and the Fed this year is Mr. Greenspan's anticipated retirement in January 2006.
 White House officials are trying to expand their list of potential successors. One early favorite -- John B. Taylor, under secretary of the Treasury -- is no longer in contention, according to people close to the White House.
 White House officials are also cool about Martin Feldstein, the esteemed Harvard professor and director of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Mr. Feldstein has been a passionate supporter of tax cuts and partly privatizing Social Security -- Mr. Bush's top economic priorities. But some officials are still angry that Mr. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, criticized deficits run up by his boss.
 MR. FELDSTEIN is not out of the running, but White House officials are looking at others. One would be R.Glenn Hubbard, an architect of Mr. Bush's tax cuts and now dean of the Columbia Business School. 
 A third possibility is Ben Bernanke, a Fed governor and a respected economist. While at the Fed, Mr. Bernanke, not a Bush insider, has impressed White House officials and is likely to be named chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Though Mr. Bernanke would be a long shot to become Fed chairman, a successful tour at the White House could help his chances.
 No matter who succeeds Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Bush will have to tread warily at the Fed. It is noteworthy that Republican Fed officials have tended to be more hawkish of late about raising rates sooner rather than later. The most dovish voice has been that of a Democrat -- Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. If tea leaves from the Fed indicate anything, it is that Mr. Bush could get tough treatment from officials tied to his own party.

HEADLINE: Parsimony From Albany

 BODY:
It was probably wishful thinking to expect Gov. George Pataki to help the city out of its fiscal crisis. Facing his own multibillion-dollar budget hole, the governor pretty much stiffed the city on education and transportation and provided limited relief on Medicaid. All that is tough news for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who now must find new and probably painful ways to close a budget gap of some $2 billion, even as he asks voters for a second term. 
 The shortfall in school aid was particularly galling. A court-appointed panel recommended increasing the budget by an extra $1.4 billion in each of the next four years to give city schoolchildren a sound basic education. Few believed that the state could produce all the money, but surely Mr. Pataki could have done better than the $280 million he offered. He proposes to raise much of the money through video lottery terminals, another name for slot machines. 
 That is too little, and too lame. Worse, it sends the wrong message just when a state judge is considering how to address the underfinancing of education. Indeed, it's not unthinkable that the schools could be made wards of the court -- an utter abdication of duty for elected officials who always claim such deep concern for education.
 The outlook for public transportation is better, but not by much. The governor has at least slowed, without actually killing, projects like the Second Avenue subway, the Grand Central rail connector and the Lower Manhattan connection to Kennedy Airport. This makes sense, as we have noted before, at a time when the state is unable to maintain the system it now has. 
 But even on this crucial matter, the governor falls short, offering less money than the Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs for regular maintenance and upgrades. As with many of the budget's whacks, such short-term savings could result in long-term damage to the economy and to the quality of life for commuters and straphangers in the metropolitan area. 
 While everyone agrees that Medicaid's out-of-control costs need to be contained, the governor's approach was a reminder that there are no easy answers to one of the thorniest problems confronting both the state and the city. He proposed savings of $1 billion statewide, including $400 million in savings for the city. But half of that would be negated by associated costs to nursing homes and city-owned hospitals. With other localities howling for Medicaid help, the mayor must fight hard for a better deal.
 The governor did not ignore the city's need for new revenues, but some of his priorities are skewed. He would raise some $200 million a year by extending the tax on clothing costing up to $110, which would hurt both low-income families and the retailers who try to compete with New Jersey outlets for their business. Meanwhile, he would hasten the process of removing the surcharge on the personal income tax for most New Yorkers making more than $100,000. When it comes to reducing taxes, the first beneficiaries should be the people most in need.
 A budget proposal is only an opening salvo that awaits a return volley from legislators. But this is shaping up as a year when Mr. Bloomberg won't be able to count on one-shot windfalls or bailouts, as happened when the state was ordered last year to take on the city's $500 million annual obligations from its 1970's debt. The mayor could always forgo his proposed $400 rebate on property taxes for homeowners. But nothing would help as much as more help from Albany.

HEADLINE: 'Don't They Know There's a War On?'

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
''ENJOY the party!'' a protestor shouted in cheerful greeting to Republicans arriving at a pre-inaugural party here. ''People are dying in Iraq. Enjoy the champagne!''
 To many Democrats, images of Republicans in sequined gowns and designer tuxedos nibbling roast quail and twirling the Texas two-step in last week's $40 million-plus inaugural extravaganza seemed inappropriate, unseemly, even unpatriotic, when American soldiers are dying in Iraq. 
 ''Precedent suggests that inaugural festivities should be muted -- if not cancelled -- in wartime,'' Representative Anthony Weiner, a Democrat from New York, chided in a letter to President Bush. Citing Franklin D. Roosevelt's austere fourth inaugural in 1945, Mr. Weiner suggested that the money would have been better spent on armored Humvees and pay bonuses for the troops.
 In a nationwide Gallup Poll released last week, 54 percent of respondents said the inauguration should have been toned down because the country was at war. But both the poll and the Democrats' protests raise a deeper question: Do Americans really feel as if they are living in a time of war?
 The few surveys on the subject suggest that many Americans aren't quite sure. In a Gallup Poll last year, two-thirds of respondents said they knew of no friend, relative or co-worker who had served in Iraq. And a Pew Research Center report to be released on Tuesday finds that Americans' political concerns are returning to where they were before Sept. 11, focusing more heavily on domestic priorities like jobs and health care than on national security or terrorism.
 Unlike the Civil War, the two World Wars and Vietnam, which were brought home to most people by the draft, tax increases and in some cases rationing, Iraq remains something of a dark cloud on the horizon, not touching most Americans in any direct way.
 But if the vast majority of Americans do not feel the economic pinch or emotional pain of this war, the concept of war remains a powerful political theme. Like the cold war, Iraq and the war on terrorism provide an important subtext to American politics without being daily concerns of most voters, said Andrew Kohut, president of Pew. 
 ''The cold war, particularly when it began in the late 40's and early 1950's, was an omnipresent force in American political thinking,'' he said. ''But it didn't change people's lives.''
 Yet, it is the political potency of the current war that makes it such a tempting cudgel for politicians. Indeed, raising questions about what is appropriate ''in a time of war'' has let politicians from both major parties assail opponents without appearing, they hope, overtly partisan. 
 ''One has to be very careful as to how one criticizes the other party during war,'' said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the presidential historian. ''But if they can couch arguments that an opponent's actions are preventing the country from being fully mobilized for war, they can avoid appearing so political.''
 Hence, Democrats have hit at Republicans not only over the lavish inaugural, but also over energy conservation (''Now!'') and tax cuts (''Not now!''). And Republicans have questioned the patriotism of Democrats who criticize Mr. Bush's security policies, saying that qualms about civil liberties must take a back seat ''in a time of war.''
 But if the war is not foremost in people's minds, can such attacks really be effective? 
 Mr. Kohut believes they can, citing Iraq and terrorism as ''decisive'' issues in Mr. Bush's re-election. 
 And Ms. Goodwin says that in wartime, certain political themes gain potency when wrapped in the flag. For that reason, she says, the Democrats might have done better last year by attacking Mr. Bush's tax cuts mainly as being harmful to the war effort, instead of emphasizing the tax cuts' threat to budgets for health care or education.
 ''It was Roosevelt who said the home front has to support the war front,'' she said. ''If it's done right, those kinds of criticisms can be very powerful.''

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Aims At State Pension System

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, echoing language used by those who claim Social Security is headed for a crisis, contends that California can no longer afford a generous traditional pension plan for state employees and teachers and should force all new workers into a 401(k)-style plan of private accounts.
 California's $300 billion pension system for its public employees is the largest state system in the nation and as early as this summer, Californians will be asked to vote on the proposed changes. The change that Mr. Schwarzenegger has endorsed is supported by a number of Republican state lawmakers and is driven by the same ideology behind the effort to transform Social Security. 
 The outcome of the vote in California, pension experts and political analysts say, will not only have an impact on the state pension system, but will also provide an important marker of public opinion on proposed changes to Social Security.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, in his State of the State address earlier this month, described California's pension system as ''another government program out of control,'' careering toward fiscal ruin. He cited the state's obligation to inject $2.6 billion into the system this year to keep it actuarially sound, compared with $160 million four years ago.
 The impetus for Mr. Schwarzenegger's plan comes from some of the same antitax advocates, free-market enthusiasts and Wall Street interests pushing President Bush's Social Security initiative. Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington lobbying and research group, has endorsed the plan. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, in California, is sponsoring a similar measure. The Jarvis group plans to put its proposal on a statewide ballot if the State Legislature does not act on the governor's plan.
 Although Social Security and the California pension plans have important differences and different long-term challenges, the proposed solution -- private accounts managed by individual workers with a predetermined contribution by employers -- is basically the same.
 ''They certainly are kissing sisters,'' said Stephen Moore, the former director of the conservative Club for Growth who is now the president of a political action committee, the Free Enterprise Fund, which is dedicated to remaking Social Security. ''These are proposals that aim toward giving people real ownership and a real stake in how the economy and the stock market perform.''
 Mr. Moore, who has advised Mr. Schwarzenegger on economic policy and participated in an independent audit of state finances last year, said that California tends to lead the nation on social policy. If California moves from a traditional defined-benefit pension plan to a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan, the nation is likely to follow, he said.
 The proposal would affect the California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, which handles the accounts of 1.4 million state and municipal workers and retirees. It has $178 billion in assets and is one of the largest pools of investment capital in the world. The proposal would also cover the California State Teachers' Retirement System, with 750,000 members and $116 billion in assets.
 Although Mr. Schwarzenegger described the plans as a looming train wreck, even advocates of privatization in his own administration say the system is currently sound. The plans, taken together, are nearly 90 percent funded, a level that most experts consider quite healthy.
 ''We're not warning of imminent collapse,'' said Tom Campbell, an economist and former member of Congress who is the state's new budget director. ''There is a potential danger for the state to have a defined benefit system, and to the extent we can move away from it, as many private employers in America have done, we should do that.''
 The danger, as Mr. Campbell and others describe it, is found in the vagaries of the stock market and the tendency of the State Legislature to award generous new retirement benefits in flush times. Unlike Social Security benefits, which can be changed by act of Congress, benefits granted to recipients of public pensions, at least in California, are virtually untouchable.
 Opponents of the plan, who include almost all Democrats in the Legislature, state employee unions and the trustees of the pension plans themselves, say that the plans have been well managed and provide a critical source of income security to workers who sacrifice pay in their working years to toil in the public sector.
 The state contribution to the system this year is large because of a downturn in the market, not because of extravagant benefits paid to retirees, they said. The state has benefited in the past from a strong stock market and in some years has had to make no payments into the funds.
 ''Calpers investments have generated $173 billion over the last 20 years,'' said Patricia K. Macht, a spokeswoman for the fund. ''Why would anyone want to throw away the chance to add another $173 billion over the next 20 years? People see this as an opportunity to use a temporary downturn to drive a stake into the heart of a well-funded system.''
 Some opponents of privatization also detect a subtler agenda among those pushing private accounts -- to silence the voice of workers and their pension fund managers, who oversee some of the largest institutional investment accounts in the nation.
 Calpers has been a leader in an effort to bring greater accountability to corporate boardrooms. It pulled its money out of tobacco companies in the 1990's, voted its shares against Michael Eisner, chairman of The Walt Disney Company and leaned on the Philippines to do more to protect worker health and safety.
 Critics say the role of pension funds is to safeguard their members' money, not make social policy.
 ''There is an overriding issue of what happens when you have these superlarge retirement systems straying from bottom line of the benefit of members and straying into corporate governance, even social engineering,'' said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. ''A motivation for us, as you move to a system of individual accounts, is that over time you will depoliticize the retirement system in the state of California.''
 Supporters of Calpers and other traditional public pension plans intend to vigorously contest an overhaul and say they expect a costly battle if the plan makes the ballot.
 Richard C. Ferlauto, director of pension investment policy for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said that Mr. Schwarzenegger and others were manufacturing a crisis to justify sweeping changes to the retirement systems that millions of workers rely on and to throttle the influence the workers wield through their pension plan investments.
 ''The debate around private accounts will be fought in California before the outcome of the Social Security debate is determined,'' Mr. Ferlauto said. ''The attempt in California is the stalking horse for whether private accounts can be sold to the American public.

HEADLINE: College Endowments Post Solid Gains in '04

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
Buoyed by a healthy stock market, university endowments posted robust earnings in 2004, but not enough to compensate fully for the losses of previous years and to enable the kind of spending that many institutions depend on to run their campuses, according to the most recent annual survey by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
 Endowments -- the financial stockpiles that help determine an institution's financial health and often pay for crucial aspects of academia, including some professors and scholarships -- brought in an average 15.1 percent return during the 2004 fiscal year. It was one of the largest average returns since the mid- to late 1990's, and it came as a huge relief after declines in 2001 and 2002, followed by only a modest rebound in 2003. 
 The survey credited the strong performance of stocks, bonds, hedge funds and other investments for last year's gains, pointing out that some indexes, including the Standard & Poor's 500, did even better than the typical endowment during the same period. But for all the good news, the survey also found that endowments still faced erosion from the combination of inflation and a widespread need to dip into the money. 
 ''We're all pleased to see the good year,'' said Jessica M. Shedd, the association's research director. ''But there's still a long way to overcome the difficulties we've faced.''
 Over the last five years, endowments have earned an average of 3.8 percent, the survey found. That is only slightly above the average rate of inflation over the same period, 2.7 percent, according to the survey. Beyond that, universities typically have to use some of their money to pay managers who orchestrate their investments. And, most significantly, institutions spend about 5 percent of their endowments every year to run their campuses, making for an overall drain on endowments despite last year's strong returns. 
 ''When you add those up, you're ending up with a deficit, so institutions are still lagging behind,'' Ms. Shedd said. ''It's entirely possible, however, for institutions to make up for that gap through gifts.''
 And make up for it they did. All but a dozen or so of the 741 colleges and universities in the survey ended up with larger endowments at the end of the 2004 fiscal year, thanks in no small part to some major fund-raising campaigns.
 In the midst of a $1.8 billion campaign, for example, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, received $190 million in grants and donations last year, the most in a single year, helping its endowment grow 20 percent. Other universities, including Brown, Tufts and the University of Michigan, also announced record gifts in 2004, and as the money comes in, it will probably help strengthen their endowments for years to come.
 But even as their endowments have grown, many public universities say the additional money has not been enough to offset recent cuts in state contributions. 
 With strong investment returns and a capital campaign to help it along, the University of Michigan's endowment grew by about $700 million, or 20 percent, during the 2004 fiscal year. That would seem to dwarf the $44 million in cuts from the state that the university says it has faced in the last two years. But because Michigan, like most careful institutions, imposes strict rules on spending from its endowment, it would have had to raise about $880 million just to make up for the loss in state money. 
 ''We got pretty close, but we didn't quite do that,'' said Timothy P. Slottow, Michigan's chief financial officer. ''Even if we did, the substitutes for state money are difficult to come by.''
 That is because state money, unlike most private donations, can usually be spent on almost any academic purpose. Even if universities were in the habit of plugging budgetary holes with alumni gifts, they would often not be able to do so, because donors often specify what their money is to be used for.
 Nonetheless, last year's healthy returns helped restore a sense of normalcy for university officials, who have occasionally felt that they were fighting, and losing, a war on two fronts: in the legislature and with the stock market. 
 ''Some of the years before were a little bit ugly, but luckily they're behind us,'' said James L. Nichols, treasurer of Ohio State University. 
 In most years, the wealthiest universities wield their financial heft and sophistication to reap the biggest rewards, often by investing more heavily in riskier options like hedge and venture capital funds. But last year, the stock market did well enough to help some institutions with more modest endowments outperform their wealthier peers. 
 The survey found that institutions with endowments of $500 million to $1 billion typically earned higher returns than Stanford (with a $9.9 billion endowment), Princeton (also $9.9 billion), Yale ($12.7 billion) and even Harvard ($22.1 billion).


CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about growth in college endowments last year referred imprecisely to the relative investment performance of colleges with endowments of $500 million to $1 billion. That group, with returns of 17.9 percent, outperformed the group with endowments over $1 billion, which had returns of 17.2 percent but did not outperform three of the specific institutions mentioned: Harvard, (21.1 percent), Yale (19.4 percent) and Stanford, (18 percent).

HEADLINE: Nations Ranked as Protectors of the Environment

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Countries from Northern and Central Europe and South America dominated the top spots in the 2005 index of environmental sustainability, which ranks nations on their success at such tasks as maintaining or improving air and water quality, maximizing biodiversity and cooperating with other countries on environmental problems.
 Finland, Norway and Uruguay held the top three spots in the ranking, prepared by researchers at Yale and Columbia Universities. The United States ranked 45th of the 146 countries studied, behind such countries as Japan, Botswana and the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, and most of Western Europe. 
 The lowest-ranking country was North Korea. Among those near the bottom were Haiti, Taiwan, Iraq and Kuwait. 
 The index is the second produced in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, which meets in Davos, Switzerland, this week. The first complete index, in 2002, produced outrage and soul-searching in lower-ranking countries like Belgium and South Korea, said Daniel C. Esty, the director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and an author of the report. 
 The report is based on 75 measures, including the rate at which children die from respiratory diseases, fertility rates, water quality, overfishing, emission of heat-trapping gases and the export of sodium dioxide, a crucial component of acid rain. 
 In its opening chapter, the Environmental Sustainability Index report said: ''Although imperfect, the E.S.I. helps to fill a long-existing gap in environmental performance evaluation. It offers a small step toward a more vigorous and quantitative approach to environmental decision making.''
 The report also cited a statistically significant correlation between high-ranking countries and countries with open political systems and effective governments. 
 The report's flaws stem largely from inadequate data, Mr. Esty said, adding that the ranking system is at best approximate, because some individual scores had to be imputed in many cases. But he said that data might improve in coming years.
 He also said a system that rated Russia, whose populated western regions have undergone extraordinary environmental degradation, as having greater environmental sustainability than the United States had inherent weaknesses. 
 At 33, Russia's ranking, Mr. Esty said, is in large part a consequence of the country's vast size. While it ''has terrible pollution problems'' in the western industrial heartland, he said, its millions of unsettled or sparsely settled acres of Asian taiga mean ''it has vast, untrammeled resources and more clean water than anywhere in the world.'' So, he added, ''on average, Russia ends up looking better than it does to someone who lives in western Russia.''
 Because such differences make many countries inherently difficult to compare, he said, this report also analyzed seven clusters of similar countries; in this analysis, the United States ranked slightly below the halfway point among 24 members of the Organization of American States. 
 Another cluster ranked countries whose land is more than 50 percent desert, including Israel and much of the Arab world. In this group, Israel ranked second, after Namibia, and the best-performing Arab countries were Oman and Jordan. But some nations with considerable oil wealth, like Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, ranked in the bottom third.
 After Finland, Norway and Uruguay, the top 10 countries in the overall rankings were, in order, Sweden, Iceland, Canada, Switzerland, Guyana, Argentina and Austria.
 Irritation at low rankings in the 2002 index spurred countries like Mexico and South Korea to improve their efforts, Mr. Esty added. Young Keun Chung, an environmental economist with South Korea's state Korea Environment Institute, agreed, saying: ''The first time we were shocked. Our government wanted to improve our situation. So we concentrated on improving environmental policy, pollution problems, traffic problems and everything.'' 
 South Korea moved up 13 spots between 2002 and the new report, but was only No.122 in the overall index, and 14th out of 21 high-density countries in which more than half the land has a population density greater than 100 people per square kilometer.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a study that ranks nations by their success in managing environmental problems referred incorrectly to an air pollutant that is an important component of acid rain. It is sulfur dioxide, not sodium dioxide.

HEADLINE: A Death at Cornell: Parents Belatedly Learn a Serial Killer's Name

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Jan. 22 

 BODY:
If Michael Bruce Ross, a convicted serial killer, is executed on schedule Wednesday morning in a northern Connecticut prison, he will die without having been prosecuted for raping and strangling Dzung Ngoc Tu on the campus of Cornell University in May 1981.
 It took several days before the body of Ms. Tu, 25, a first-year graduate student in economics, was discovered in the waters of Fall Creek, the first fatality but the final victim in a series of sexual assaults at Cornell that spring. 
 But it took nearly 24 years, until the week before Mr. Ross's scheduled execution, for her family, Vietnamese immigrants who came to this Washington suburb in the middle of the Vietnam War, to learn that the crime that devastated them so long ago had been solved for much of the two decades they have spent grieving. Mr. Ross confessed to it in 1987, but was never charged. 
 ''My sister went back to college one day and then we heard she was dead and that was it,'' Lan Manh Tu, her older brother, recalled in a phone interview last Wednesday, the same conversation in which he learned from a reporter that her death had been linked to Mr. Ross. ''It was thought likely that somebody, that whoever had murdered my sister, was one of these people who had the wrong wiring. They prey on strangers and are very difficult to catch unless they do something to attract attention.''
 If the case of Dzung Ngoc Tu seems a murder mystery cruelly and unnecessarily prolonged, it is also a complex one, full of conflicting memories and lingering questions, of grief enduring beneath emotional reserve, and of a golden lost daughter whose father still kneels before her ashes to mourn.
 ''He has never been able to mention it,'' Lan Tu said, ''the fact that my sister died.''
 In 1984, after Mr. Ross was arrested and linked to six killings in Connecticut in which five of the victims were raped, he became a suspect in two similar rapes and killings in New York State. One was the 1982 death of Paula Perrera, 16, in Wallkill, about 90 miles north of New York City. The other was that of Ms. Tu at Cornell in Ithaca, where Mr. Ross graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics shortly after her death. 
 Mr. Ross eventually was sentenced to death for four of the Connecticut cases, and also confessed to both New York crimes. In 2001, long after he was originally convicted in Connecticut, he was convicted and sentenced to 8 to 25 years in prison in Orange County in the case of Paula Perrera.
 But for reasons of practicality and what an investigator and prosecutor said they perceived as a desire for family privacy, Tompkins County, where Cornell is located, never charged Mr. Ross for killing Dzung Ngoc Tu, who was, by his own account, his first murder victim.
 Now, because he has decided not to pursue appeals, Mr. Ross is about to become the first person executed in New England since 1960. His status as a so-called volunteer has prompted a flurry of last-minute court efforts by death penalty opponents to stop the execution, even as state polls and many politicians show support for it. 
 The final days before the execution have made for a passionate and legally complicated countdown in Connecticut, where some victims' families have attended court hearings for years. But it was not until Friday that a sense of expectation arose in the modest Bethesda house where Ms. Tu arrived in 1969 at the age of 13 and where her parents still live. 
 On Friday, Lan Tu, after consulting an uncle, approached his father with the news about the killer. The day before, he had told his siblings and other relatives. ''He had no idea,'' Lan Tu said of his father. ''This is the first he had heard of it.'' 
 The next morning, the father sat on a leather sofa in front of a wide window that framed the falling snow. He is 74 years old, and he asked that he and his wife not be fully identified to protect the privacy they have long tried to maintain. 
 ''It feels like a nightmare is coming back,'' he said evenly, his sandaled feet resting flat on the chilly living room floor. ''But I'm glad to know her killer was caught.''
 He sat very still but left the room twice over more than an hour, once returning with tea, once returning with the last photograph taken of his oldest daughter, smiling at her 25th birthday party at Cornell a month before she was killed.
 A friend had sent it with a letter of condolence, one of dozens the family has saved. Mr. Tu's voice caught briefly at one point as he nodded to an evergreen tree in the backyard.
 ''I used to sit in that seat and look at that tree outside the window and see her up there,'' he said. ''But I also knew I had to go on with my life. I still had a family.''
 In Connecticut, Mr. Ross has become a familiar face on television news and in newspapers, constantly reiterating a wish to be executed that he says is rooted in a desire to help heal his victims' families.
 In Bethesda, Mr. Tu and his family said they had never heard of Mr. Ross. Only now, over hours and days, were they absorbing the range of emotions other families have experienced over years. Mr. Tu said he shared the news with his wife early Saturday morning. Mrs. Tu, who is not fluent in English, stayed in a back bedroom while Mr. Tu and his son Lan, 49, talked to a reporter in the living room.
 It is unclear how much contact may have occurred between the Tu family and investigators after Mr. Ross became a suspect. Time seems to have faded some memories, while other recollections simply conflict.
 A Cornell police investigator who worked on the case, Scott C. Hamilton, said he had contacted the family twice to let them know Mr. Ross had become a suspect, once in the late 1980's and again in the early 1990's.
 ''I remember I called the family,'' Mr. Hamilton said in a phone interview. ''Whoever I talked to was a male, and he said 'we're not interested in pursuing anything.' I called again, and whoever I talked to said they had moved back and weren't in the country anymore.''
 Mr. Hamilton said that as convictions piled up against Mr. Ross in Connecticut, prosecuting the Cornell crime seemed less urgent. ''What are you going to do?'' he said. ''What's it going to mean?''
 The prosecutor at the time Mr. Ross became a suspect, Benjamin J. Bucko, said he did not remember making contact with the family.
 Mr. Bucko, retired and living in Groton, N.Y., said he felt he could not prosecute the case because ''there was just no evidence at the scene'' and because Mr. Ross's confession first surfaced in the testimony of a psychiatrist, complicating whether it could be used in a trial.
 George M. Dentes, who replaced Mr. Bucko as Tompkins County district attorney in 1989, said the fact that Mr. Ross had been sentenced to death in Connecticut made prosecution pointless in New York, where there was no death penalty at the time the crime was committed.
 ''Here he couldn't even get the death penalty, and this woman was a foreign student whose relatives, I think, they really didn't even want anything done,'' he said. ''We were without really a victim or even the survivors of the victim here or even any local interest in the case, and basically we decided not to prosecute.''
 Lan Tu said the notion that the family was uninterested or had moved back to Vietnam was mystifying. ''We've had the same phone number since 1969,'' he said, incredulous. ''We were in the phone book in Bethesda the whole time.''
 Mr. Tu, a retired economist for an international banking organization who speaks English slowly and with a strong accent, said he had not been contacted by investigators or prosecutors since several months after the murder. He said he had called and written to prosecutors for several months after Dzung's death but eventually gave up.
 ''I saw no point in trying to go out and scream to the heavens or quit my job and go to Cornell,'' Mr. Tu said. ''I felt it might bring about nothing and possibly could destroy me.''
 He added, ''I accepted it as fate. That was my mistake.''
 He expressed frustration with the way investigators handled his daughter's death. ''If the authorities had been more active and more efficient pursuing Dzung's death, then it's possible that the subsequent crimes could have been avoided,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Tu, who each month prays at a Buddhist temple in Washington where his daughter's ashes are stored next to those of her grandmother, said there may have been benefits to not knowing. ''If I had been informed as early as 1984,'' he said, ''then probably the last 20 years would have been even more painful.''
 He added, ''His execution would go a long way toward putting my mind at rest, in giving me peace. I hope this will go ahead, that nothing's going to stop it,'' he said. ''Certainly in my mind I have questions about the death penalty, but when someone's in my position, abstract considerations are no longer that important.''
 He said his daughter, who was just under 5 feet tall and weighed less than 100 pounds, was an idealist who worked hard. She sponsored orphaned children through the mail. She volunteered to help cancer patients. She graduated from Walt Whitman High School here in 1973 and from Vassar College in 1977.
 On the night Dzung Ngoc Tu was killed in 1981, investigators say, she had been studying in Warren Hall, the same campus building where Mr. Ross had been working.
 ''My feeling about it mostly is that it's such a shame that her life was snuffed out,'' said Lan Tu, who works as a real estate appraiser near Annapolis, Md., and is one of four living siblings. ''She would have been a really good person to have in the world, not just for her family, but for society.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A headline on Monday with an article about the 1981 killing of a Cornell University student by a serial killer now on death row in Connecticut omitted attribution for the claim that the student's family was not informed until recently that the case was solved in 1987. That is the family's contention. Because of an editing error, the article referred imprecisely to the accounts given by the family of the victim, Dzung Ngoc Tu, and by Cornell. The sides differ on when and how the university informed the family about the investigation; their differences go beyond conflicting memories and lingering questions. Cornell officials disclosed records yesterday describing their contacts with the family. Developments are reported today on Page B5.

HEADLINE: After Postpunk? Post-Postpunk by the Gang of Four

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Clank. Clank. Clank. Clank. Jon King, lead singer of the Gang of Four, was methodically bashing a metal rod against a microwave oven that he found at a recycling dump. Each blow added a dent; paint chips went flying.
 It wasn't petulance; it was the introduction to ''He'd Send in the Army,'' a bleak, brittle song from the Gang of Four's 1981 album ''Solid Gold.'' Stubbornly slow, with Hugo Burnham's drums, and Dave Allen's bass stopping and starting, and Andy Gill's guitar shrieking across the spaces, it is one of the band's most rigorous and unforgiving songs, and one of its favorites.
 On Friday night at the Montague Arms, a packed pub in the scruffy New Cross neighborhood of South London, about 200 latter-day punk fans greeted the song with a curiosity that quickly turned into cheers. The four men, now in their late 40's, were playing their first show together since 1981. 
 They immediately reclaimed the meticulous ferocity that made the Gang of Four one of postpunk's most influential bands. Its old blend of the cerebral and the visceral was in full force as Mr. King sang lyrics like ''Fornication makes you happy/No escape from society'' with hips pumping and hands in the air. Afterward, one sweaty patron in his 20's said, ''I hadn't realized how much all the bands I like sound like them.'' 
 It's exactly the right moment for the Gang of Four to reappear. The sound of postpunk -- the smart underground rock from the late 1970's and early 80's that followed through on punk's iconoclasm, noise and eccentricity -- has made a startling comeback. Though few postpunk bands breached the Top 40, they left their mark on musicians a generation younger. In Britain and the United States, bands like Franz Ferdinand, the Rapture, Radio 4 and Bloc Party have latched on to the jumpy, clattery beats and combative guitars of the Gang of Four and its contemporaries. Members of the Gang of Four hear themselves echoed in their children's album collections. 
 Reunited postpunk bands like the Pixies and Mission of Burma have found eager young audiences on tour, and now the Gang of Four is headed for the road. ''The goal is to be as incredibly intense as we were the first time around,'' Mr. Allen said. ''What we have to do is leave them with their tongues hanging out again. If not, we don't retain our authority in the musical canon. There's no excuse that we're 23 years older.'' 
 Mr. Burnham added, ''I realized that we could do it because we all still had our hair.''
 This week the Gang of Four is playing five shows at 2,000-capacity clubs around Britain, and it starts a United States tour with an appearance in California at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, which runs from April 30 to May 1. Last year the Pixies probably set the gold standard for reunion tours by barnstorming festivals and by selling out 3,000-seaters for eight months. The Gang of Four's music was far more ascetic than the Pixies' songs, and its reunion is more modest, with the band members returning to day jobs between stretches of touring. But if the band's first show was any indication, it should galvanize a new audience.
 Formed in 1977, the Gang of Four came up with what would soon be called punk-funk. 
 The band was conceived by Mr. Gill and Mr. King, high school friends and fellow art students at Leeds University. They visited New York in the summers of 1976 and 1977 as punk, primitivism and art-rock were conspiring at CBGB. ''It suggested the possibility that anything could happen,'' Mr. Gill said. (The band's sardonic name came from the radical leaders in China who fomented the Cultural Revolution. These days Mr. Gill uses a cigarette lighter shaped like Mao's Little Red Book.)
 The music Mr. Gill wanted to make was like paintings he was doing at the time: precise black grids with blotches of paint smeared across them. ''It would be the juxtaposition of tight, fixed patterns that were very physically energizing and relentless, which would largely be supplied by the bass and drums, and the guitar, which would sometimes completely go along with that, and sometimes not,'' he said. ''If you took one of these elements out and made it ordinary, the whole thing would lose its authenticity. Every part of it had to be radical. It was building musical tension in a precise way.'' 
 Precision meshed with anarchy via Mr. Gill's guitar, which touched down in funk rhythms only to veer into defiantly dissonant lines, glassy harmonics and wails of feedback. ''On the surface it looked like a rock band,'' Mr. Allen said. ''But the idea was, 'How can we turn this whole thing upside down?'''
 The Gang of Four's lyrics were equally astringent. Although they were quickly classed as political, few of the band's songs were direct protests. ''What we were trying to do was understand the way things worked,'' Mr. Gill said. The lyrics were bitterly analytical, infused with theories from Marx, Adorno, Baudrillard and Godard, and the band was determined to puncture pop romance with the consciousness that people are manipulated by power, economics, media and marketing. ''Why not write about ideas?'' Mr. King said.
 ''This band had something to say, and it had this really odd guitar sound,'' Gordon Moakes, the bassist of Bloc Party, said by telephone from Glasgow. ''People picking up the guitar now are interested in that very percussive guitar approach, which the Gang of Four did like no other band did. The Gang of Four pretty much covered that whole area, so anyone who tries it sounds like them.'' 
 The band has returned to its most significant lineup. Its members recall the group's glory years as contentious. ''This time around, everyone has even stronger opinions and there's even less backing down,'' Mr. Allen said.
 Mr. Allen quit the band in 1981, exhausted from touring, and he had not had any contact with Mr. King until last year. Mr. Burnham was fired in 1983. ''I think they wanted a duopoly rather than a triumvirate,'' he said.
 Mr. King and Mr. Gill retained the Gang of Four name for later, more conventional albums, working together on and off until 1995. But the reunited Gang of Four is the one that made its indelible 1979 debut album, ''Entertainment!,'' along with ''Solid Gold.'' With some satisfaction, Mr. Burnham said, ''Those are the albums that matter.'' 
 The band doesn't plan to write new songs. But it has recorded a new double album to be sold on tour and online: 15 old songs redone with better equipment, and a second CD of remixes by old fans including Franz Ferdinand, Massive Attack, Bloc Party and Futureheads. The band had been determinedly austere on ''Entertainment!,'' recording without overdubs. ''It's not dated by any particular production technique because it didn't have one,'' Mr. Allen said with a laugh. Mr. Gill half-jokingly compared the difference between the old and new versions of the songs to the difference between Giotto and Michelangelo: ''the skinny primitivism of the original text as against the muscular, beefy, luxuriant 2005 version.''
 Mr. Gill is the only band member continuing his recording career, writing soundtracks and producing bands including Killing Joke and the Jesus Lizard. Mr. Burnham, who worked as a band manager and recording-company executive after leaving the Gang of Four, teaches at the New England Institute of Art in Brookline, Mass. The other two members have followed the band's media critiques with media jobs. Mr. King is the chief executive of World Television, which produces news reports, Webcasts and corporate video for clients from Greenpeace to Nestle. Mr. Allen lives in Portland, Ore., and works in digital-music distribution and brand marketing with his company, Pampelmoose. 
 The band members had to shape up for the tour. Mr. Burnham hadn't played drums since 1985; he started exercising with his wife, a Pilates trainer. Mr. King, who is still lean, teased the other band members with e-mail messages about the ''celebrity fat club.'' But as they started to relearn the songs, old reflexes came back. 
 ''The blueprint was still in my body,'' Mr. Allen said.
 On the 9-foot-by-18-foot stage of the Montague Arms, Mr. King flailed and twitched, dropped to the floor and leaped up like a funky scarecrow, as hyperactive as he was a generation ago. ''It's the tragedy of old age that people stop doing stupid things,'' he said before the show. ''When you're young, you're reckless and oppositional, and that's what you should be your whole life. Why should you not take a risk?''

HEADLINE: Record Immigration Changing New York's Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The immigrants who remade New York in the 1990's are now indelibly shaping its future, according to new city figures showing that 6 in 10 babies born in the city since 2000 have at least one foreign-born parent. The foreign-born groups growing fastest through immigration, including Mexicans, Guyanese and Bangladeshis, also have among the highest birthrates, the figures show. 
 Even for a city with a storied immigrant past, the sheer size and diversity of the present foreign-born population is greater than ever before, according to the most detailed and sweeping portrait of immigrant New York ever to be issued by the City Planning Department. Demographers counted 2.9 million immigrant residents in 2000 and estimate the current number is at least 3.2 million, a record high. 
 The report, to be released today as a 265-page book called ''The Newest New Yorkers 2000: Immigrant New York in the New Millennium,'' offers a comprehensive look at the foreign-born residents who have transformed the city's neighborhoods, schools and businesses, bringing sari shops to Queens, halal pizza to Brooklyn and Ghanaian preachers to the Bronx. Unlike earlier city reports that dealt only with legal immigrants recorded by federal authorities, this analysis tries to capture legal, illegal and temporary residents alike, combining census information, city housing surveys and vital statistics to offer a fine-grained topography of a global resettlement unmatched by any other metropolis. 
 One result is the striking emergence of Mexicans as the fifth largest immigrant group in the city. Their census numbers quadrupled to 122,550 in the decade since 1990, when they ranked 17th with 32,689. City demographers said the true growth was still higher, possibly to a total of 200,000, and not expected to slow. Births to the city's Mexican-born mothers -- 6,408 in 2000 -- are second only to births to foreign-born Dominicans, who remained the most numerous of the city's foreign-born groups at 369,000 residents, followed by the Chinese, the Jamaicans, and the Guyanese.
 The report did not try to calculate rates of illegal immigration for Mexicans or any other group, though Mr. Salvo acknowledged that the large increase in the Mexican-born population could not be accounted for by recorded legal immigration. Jeffrey Passel, a demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center who has studied the issue, said that nationally, 80 to 85 percent of all Mexican immigration since 1990 was undocumented, while among other immigrant groups, a great majority had entered legally.
 ''Any place that's getting a lot of new immigration from Mexico, virtually all of it is undocumented,'' Mr. Passel said, ''and that certainly includes New York.''
 Still, the city is home to only 1 percent of Mexicans in the United States -- compared with 54 percent of the nation's Dominican-born immigrants and 45 percent of its Bangladeshis, who are the city's fastest-growing group. Too few to count in 1980, Bangladeshis surged to 17th place from 42nd in the 1990's, mainly through diversity visas issued by lottery. They now place 10th in the number of births, with Pakistanis right behind them. One reason is that nearly 80 percent of Bangladeshi households are married-couple families, as are more than 6 in 10 Indian, Chinese, and Pakistani homes, compared with only 31 percent of native-born New Yorkers' households. 
 At a time when a Congressional push for crackdowns on illegal immigrants is converging with backlogs in legal immigration, the report stresses the economic benefits that sheer numbers of newcomers brought the city in recent decades, replacing residents who died or moved out, filling housing vacancies, revitalizing small businesses, and now accounting for 43 percent of the city's work force. High rates of migration to other states are still offset only by a combination of foreign immigration and births increased by immigrant fertility, the demographers said.
 ''If we didn't have immigration, I don't know where we'd be,'' said Joseph Salvo, director of the department's population division and co-author of the report with Arun Peter Lobo. ''Immigrant flows have mitigated catastrophic population losses in the 1970's, stabilized the city's population in the 1980's, and helped the city reach a new population peak of over 8 million in 2000.'' 
 In the new world limned by the report, ethnicity and race are moving categories. More than a third of the city's black population is now foreign-born, the demographers said, with Afro-Caribbeans, who represent 21 percent of the city's immigrants, tending to replace African-Americans moving outside the city and to southern states, and the African-born population more than doubling to 92,400, or more than 3 percent of the foreign born. 
 Though Europeans increased in numbers through a surge of refugees and the use of diversity visas, available to people with low rates of recent immigration, like Poland, they declined to 19 percent of the city's foreign-born population from 24 percent. Had the countries of the former Soviet Union been counted together, as in earlier reports, immigrants born there would have been the city's fourth largest group, with 164,000 residents. Instead, Russia placed 10th, with 81,408, with Ukraine, Belarus and others lower on the list.
 Nearly a third of city immigrants are from Latin America. Yet they seem as much divided as united by their Hispanic origins, with Mexicans joining the Chinese in Sunset Park, Ecuadoreans in Jackson Heights beside Bangladeshis, and Salvadorans and Guatemalans showing up in Far Rockaway. In that seaside neighborhood, demographers also discovered Russians, Ukrainians, Haitians, Israelis, Nigerians and Jamaicans after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, noticing its unusually high numbers of non-English speakers on a map of literacy needs recently, asked them, ''What's going on down there?'' 
 In his 1997 book ''A Far Rockaway of the Heart,'' the Bronx-born poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti might have provided an answer:
 Everything changes and nothing changes
 Centuries end 
 and all goes on
 as if nothing ever ends
 And the fever of savage city life 
 still grips the streets
 But I still hear singing
 A century ago, when immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe poured through Ellis Island, the foreign-born made up more than 40 percent of the city's population -- 80 percent when their American-born children were counted, too. But the city's total population was then only 4.7 million. At 36 percent of today's 8 million New Yorkers -- up from a low of 18 percent in 1970 -- the size of today's foreign-born population is a record, and taken together, foreign-born residents and their offspring account for more than 55 percent of the city's population. More than 43 percent of the foreign-born arrived after 1990, and 80 percent after 1980.
 The same dynamic that New York experienced then is now under way in the 31 counties of the metropolitan region, the report said, especially in Hudson, Passaic, Union, Middlesex, Bergen and Essex in New Jersey and Westchester in New York, which all count the foreign-born as more than one-fifth of their populations.
 Increasingly, some immigrant groups, like Jamaicans and Haitians, are bypassing the city and settling directly in adjacent counties, drawn to housing vacated by aging European immigrants of earlier migrations and their children.
 ''New York City is as much a process as a place,'' the report said of these crosscurrents. 
 What Mr. Salvo called the report's ''wall-to-wall statistics'' conveyed a strikingly mixed bag of socioeconomic factors, with some large groups, like Dominicans and Mexicans, far below the city's median education and earnings, and others, like Filipinos and Indians, far above it. In many groups, high rates of homeownership coexist with high rates of overcrowding -- 42.2 percent of Chinese households are owner-occupied, for example, and 34.2 percent are overcrowded, compared with citywide rates of 30.3 and 14.6 percent respectively.
 Just over one in four foreign-born Dominicans has completed high school, and only 30 percent speak English very well. Nearly a third are in poverty, compared with a citywide rate of 21 percent, and 18.6 percent of households are on public assistance, compared with 7.5 percent for all residents. 
 Though Mexicans had the city's lowest median earnings ($16,737 for women, $21,284 for men) and lowest levels of education (slightly more than a third graduated from high school), they managed to bring their household incomes to 85 percent of the city median of $37,700, by having multiple workers in overcrowded households. 
 That was a strategy used even by highly educated foreign-born groups like the city's 49,600 Filipinos, at the other end of the spectrum. Median female earning among Filipinos was $51,000, and median household income $70,500, both the highest of any immigrant group. Though there are only 60 Filipino men to every 100 Filipino women, the Filipino poverty rate is only 5.3 percent, a fourth the citywide rate of 21 percent; only 2 percent receive public assistance. 
 ''There is no typical New York immigrant,'' Mr. Salvo said. The report assembles an intricate mosaic of facts to support that assertion, from the highest rates of homeownership (Italians, 64 percent) to the most skewed sex ratio (161 Pakistani men to every 100 Pakistani women). Its combination of maps and tables pinpoint the whereabouts of the top 40 immigrant groups, from the 90,336 Dominicans in Washington Heights, to the five French immigrants settled in the Great Kills Zip code on Staten Island.
 ''The level of complexity and diversity is beyond anything we've had in our history,'' Mr. Salvo said. ''We've evolved into a city that's just an unprecedented mix. And for the most part all these people get along -- it's a testament to the power of the city.''

HEADLINE: A Bridge to Sell

 BODY:
One of the main talking points in the administration's drive to privatize Social Security is that retirees have nothing to fear. ''If you're a senior receiving your Social Security check, nothing is going to change,'' President Bush said recently. Mr. Bush seems to presume that older Americans are indifferent to the future retirement security of their children and grandchildren. But even taken on its face, the argument does not hold up. 
 The president promises that under a private retirement scheme, anyone age 55 or older would continue to receive full Social Security benefits. What he repeatedly fails to mention is that privatization would require some $2 trillion in new borrowing over the next 10 years and an additional $4.5 trillion in the decade thereafter. That's on top of the trillions that need to be found to cover the costs of Medicare and Medicaid and -- if the president gets his way -- to make this decade's tax cuts permanent. It's foolhardy to assume that the government could continue to meet all of its obligations, including the payment of Social Security benefits, under such a mountain of debt. 
 All told, by 2030, when today's 55-year-olds turn 80, the national debt would be as big as the economy itself, according to a calculation by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that uses data from Social Security and the Congressional Budget Office. To compare, consider that in the last 50 years, national debt has equaled only 38 percent of the economy on average, and that percentage includes the tremendous overhang of debt from World War II. 
 Large and virtually permanent fiscal imbalances could create severe hardship. At the least, big and ongoing deficits erode living standards because they reduce the money available for investment in the economy. At worst, enormous and endless deficits could provoke a loss of investor confidence, leading to higher interest rates and inflation, lower stock and bond prices, less household wealth, less government spending and slower economic growth. 
 If Congress faced that kind of crisis, it's safe to assume that everything would be on the table, including Social Security retirement benefits. This would be especially true if such a crisis were provoked by privatization. The reason: diverting a portion of payroll taxes into private accounts -- the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's privatization scheme -- would greatly accelerate the exhaustion of the Social Security trust fund, unless the government made huge transfusions of other tax revenue into the fund. It could be difficult to justify such transfers if the economy were in dire straits. A dwindling trust fund, in turn, could create a political dynamic for benefit cuts that would be hard to resist. 
 Even if Congress managed to keep the commitment to continued funding of full Social Security benefits for today's retirement-age population, senior citizens could find that their other sources of retirement income, especially stocks and bonds, had taken a hit. Their adult children would probably not be able to provide a safety net. Indeed, a country in fiscal crisis is one in which adults are more likely to turn to their elderly parents for help. 
 Despite the risks to their own economic well-being in retirement, some older Americans might be willing to support Social Security privatization if it would ensure a stable retirement for their children and grandchildren. But it wouldn't. Privatization would require potentially debilitating borrowing up front, in exchange for a drastically reduced benefit later on, no matter how well, or poorly, private accounts performed. So there's no reason for senior citizens to support it and plenty of reasons to oppose it. Mr. Bush is wily, and wrong, when he tries to dismiss older Americans from the debate.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley is flush with cash, so why are job and income numbers there still lagging?

BYLINE: By Gary Rivlin

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
VENTURE capital is on the rise, and once again Silicon Valley is growing thick with startups. Research and development funding in the Valley has hit new highs and corporate profits at area firms are generally robust.
 And yet, despite an environment in which entrepreneurship is strong and established firms are by and large healthy, the Silicon Valley job market remains stagnant. Household income in the area is down, and troubling disparities persist in the areas of health care, education and housing. 
 Those are among the findings of a report, ''2005 Silicon Valley Index,'' released today by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a nonprofit organization that assesses the region's economic health each year.
 ''There are really two ways to view the Silicon Valley economy,'' said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. ''You could say lots of things are up in Silicon Valley, which gives us reason to be hopeful, except jobs are down, and of course that's an enormous exception.'' Mr. Levy was an adviser to the Joint Venture. 
 ''Sales and exports are up at Silicon Valley companies,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Profits are up. But that's not translating into general prosperity. In the past, we could take the return of prosperity among Silicon Valley's biggest companies as a signal that general prosperity is upon us. But I think the story here is that link has been severed. The question now is whether that link has been severed permanently.'' 
 The study found that the region lost an estimated 1.3 percent of its jobs between mid-2003 and mid-2004, and average pay fell by 1 percent. That drop came on the heels of the 200,000 jobs that were lost earlier in the decade -- representing nearly 20 percent of the work force -- when the San Jose metropolitan area, which includes much of Silicon Valley, suffered the worst collapse of any metropolitan area in the United States since the Great Depression, surpassing even Detroit in the early 1980's, which lost 13 percent of its jobs. 
 ''Silicon Valley used to be this place that created jobs at a dizzying pace,'' said Russell Hancock, the group's chief executive. ''People thought of that as a reality, but our index is saying this is reality. The reality is that ours is an economy that will be very productive on the high end but not necessarily this big job generator.''
 The main culprit, Mr. Hancock said, has not been that jobs have migrated to countries where labor is cheaper, as one might have expected, but that productivity gains have enabled companies to do more with less. 
 ''Offshoring has always been part of the Silicon Valley story, back to the 70's,'' Mr. Hancock said. ''Today it's Taiwan and China and India, but back then it was the Japanese. What we do in Silicon Valley is innovate, things become a commodity, and so it's moved offshore while we continue to do the design and innovation.''
 Increasingly, those high-end jobs can be found in the health and medical fields, the report found. ''The local economy is creating these dynamic new clusters in areas like biotech, the biomedical industry, bioinformatics, health care and at the intersection of bio with information technology,'' Mr. Hancock said. ''That seems to be where the job generation is.''
 The report's authors cautioned against drawing conclusions that were too negative. If comparing present-day Silicon Valley to 2000, things look grim by nearly every measure, as the area has seen a steep decline in everything from jobs to venture capital to funding for the arts and municipal services. 
 But if the comparison year is 1998, just before the dot-com phenomenon spun out of control, ''then we seem to have returned to similar levels of performance, and embarked on a new period of incremental growth,'' according to the report's authors. The study also found that 40 percent of the regional population is foreign-born, up from 32 percent in 2000.
 ''I'd say it's not bad news coming out of Silicon Valley, but we have our challenges,'' Mr. Hancock said. Primary among those concerns is what he called the ''Manhattan effect.'' 
 ''Our worry is that Silicon Valley becomes this world center for people working on innovative enterprises who can afford to live here, but at the same time people who want and need to be here find that ours has turned into an economy that's not robust in terms of the middle,'' he said. That day hasn't arrived yet, Mr. Hancock said, but the study found that housing is so expensive that ''it's difficult to retain young talent, teachers and service professionals.''

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Faces A New Set Of Challenges After Powell

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
The departure of Michael K. Powell from the Federal Communications Commission in a few weeks will lead to profound and subtle policy and personality changes for an agency at the center of the transformation of the telecommunications and media industries. 
 During Mr. Powell's four years as head of the agency, regional Bells have largely prevailed against long-distance companies and their smaller rivals. And media conglomerates have mostly been foiled in their efforts to relax limitations that have prevented them from expanding into markets and lines of business. 
 Now, new challenges are arising. The telephone companies face competition from less-regulated cable companies, and have responded by beginning to offer their own video services. The biggest phone companies are scampering to adapt to the nascent Internet telephone services and hope to employ their own versions. 
 The media companies, meanwhile, have begun to face an assault on their standards by groups that have pressured the agency to issue a record number and amount of fines for violations of indecency rules. The fines have not put any significant dent on the earnings of the companies. But they have had an effect on programming -- prompting some stations to refuse to broadcast programs, including the movie ''Saving Private Ryan,'' and others, like public stations, to revise scenes from ''Masterpiece Theatre'' shows to avoid sanctions.
 Under Mr. Powell, the agency has a number of unresolved issues. It has not responded to a federal appeals court decision last June that ordered it to rethink rules Mr. Powell advanced that would ease the way for conglomerates to buy TV affiliates and run newspapers and broadcast stations in the same cities.
 By all accounts, the most vexing rulemaking facing the commission is sorting through proposed changes to the complicated rules governing how much phone companies pay one another to begin and complete calls, and the regulations governing the financing of programs that provide universal telephone service to underserved areas. 
 ''The big hairy ugly issues left for the next commission are intercarrier compensation and universal service,'' said Scott C. Cleland, a telecom analyst at the Precursor Group. ''It's a spaghetti bowl level of complexity. It makes your head spin.''
 Many of the telephone-access fee regulations will expire this summer, and industry lawyers have failed to come up with new rules. Compounding the complexity is that the Bell companies, traditionally the largest recipients of the access fees, are swiftly moving into new businesses, like long-distance and broadband data transmission, forcing them to take different positions in the debate. What is more, cable companies and computer application concerns are also offering telephone services.
 Analysts said that the answers to the intercarrier compensation and universal service issues would determine market winners and losers and resolve the most important regulatory issues facing the new Internet telephone services.
 In addition, major political changes in Washington are certain to alter the debate over the access and universal service fees. Foremost among these is the new leadership at the Senate Commerce Committee, which was headed by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. It now falls under the control of Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, and Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii. 
 The two men will play the most important roles in overseeing the commission and drafting any telecommunications legislation. They have a close working relationship and an abiding interest, by virtue of their constituency, in promoting the universal service program. They are seen as tilting in favor of rivals of the Bell companies.
 Mr. Powell, who did not respond to a request for an interview, vowed when he became chairman that he would run a more collegial and efficient agency, saying that he had learned valuable lessons after three years as a Republican commissioner at the agency during the time it was led by Democrats.
 But he often led a bitter and partisan F.C.C., which at pivotal moments he could not control. His allies complained that they found him mercurial and unpredictable, while his opponents said they were shut out from the process. 
 When one member of the commission voted against the chairman after they failed to reach a compromise, Mr. Powell eliminated the commissioner's budget for international travel, officials said. And throughout his tenure, the agency's two Democrats repeatedly said that if they had been included in the process, deals would have been reached on regulations that would have been able to withstand court challenges.
 Mr. Powell also promised at the outset to bring what he called ''rigorous economic analysis'' to changes in rules. But the agency's analysis on critical telephone and media company rules was sharply attacked by the courts for being ''arbitrary and capricious.''
 Kevin J. Martin and Becky A. Klein, the top two candidates for Mr. Powell's job, have earned reputations as regulators for being more conciliatory and less partisan and ideological than Mr. Powell. Mr. Martin, a Republican commissioner and former White House aide, angered some of the Bell companies two years ago when he broke ranks with Mr. Powell and voted with the agency's two Democrats to leave in place rules that were meant to foster local telephone competition by requiring the four regional Bell companies to lease their local networks to their rivals at low prices set by state regulators.
 But Mr. Martin has taken steps to mend relations, and senior executives at two Bell companies said he was their preferred candidate.
 Ms. Klein, a former head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and top adviser to Mr. Bush when he was the state's governor, was known for taking a bipartisan approach to regulation.

HEADLINE: 'Never Retire'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
The Nobel laureate James Watson, who started a revolution in science as co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, put it to me straight a couple of years ago: ''Never retire. Your brain needs exercise or it will atrophy.'' 
 Why, then, am I bidding Op-Ed readers farewell today after more than 3,000 columns? Nobody pushed me; at 75, I'm in good shape, not afflicted with political ennui; and my recent column about tsunami injustice and the Book of Job drew the biggest mail response in 32 years of pounding out punditry.
 Here's why I'm outta here: In an interview 50 years before, the aging adman Bruce Barton told me something like Watson's advice about the need to keep trying something new, which I punched up into ''When you're through changing, you're through.'' He gladly adopted the aphorism, which I've been attributing to him ever since. 
 Combine those two bits of counsel -- never retire, but plan to change your career to keep your synapses snapping -- and you can see the path I'm now taking. Readers, too, may want to think about a longevity strategy.
 We're all living longer. In the past century, life expectancy for Americans has risen from 47 to 77. With cures for cancer, heart disease and stroke on the way, with genetic engineering, stem cell regeneration and organ transplants a certainty, the boomer generation will be averting illness, patching itself up and pushing well past the biblical limits of ''threescore and ten.'' 
 But to what purpose? If the body sticks around while the brain wanders off, a longer lifetime becomes a burden on self and society. Extending the life of the body gains most meaning when we preserve the life of the mind.
 That idea led a lifetime friend, David Mahoney, who headed the Dana Foundation until his death in 2000, to join with Jim Watson in forming the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives. They roped me in, a dozen years ago, to help enliven a moribund ''decade of the brain.'' By encouraging many of the most prestigious neuroscientists to get out of the ivory tower and explain in plain words the potential of brain science, they enlisted the growing public and private support for research.
 That became the program running quietly in the background of my on-screen life as language maven, talking head, novelist and twice-weekly vituperative right-wing scandalmonger. 
 I had no pretensions about becoming a scientist (having been graduated near the bottom of my class at the Bronx High School of Science) but did launch a few publications and a Web site -- www.Dana.org -- that opened some channels among scientists, journalists and people seeking reliable information about the exciting field.
 Experience as a Times polemicist made it easier to wade into the public controversies of science. Dana philanthropy provides forums to debate neuroethics: Is it right to push beyond treatment for mental illness to enhance the normal brain? Should we level human height with growth hormones? Is cloning ever morally sound? Does a drug-induced sense of well-being undermine ''real'' happiness? Such food for thought is now becoming my meat.
 And what about what the cognition crowd calls ''executive transfer'' in learning? Does an early grasp of the arts -- music, dance, drama, drawing -- affect a child's ability to apply that cognitive process to facility in math, architecture, history? New imaging techniques and much-needed longitudinal studies may provide answers rather than anecdotes and affect arts budgets in schools. 
 So I told The Times's publisher two years ago that the 2004 presidential campaign would be my last hurrah as political pundit, and that I would then take on the full-time chairmanship of Dana. He expressed appropriate dismay at losing the Op-Ed conservative but said it would be a terrible idea to abandon the Sunday language column. That's my scholarly recreation, so I agreed to continue. (Don't use so as a conjunction!)
 Starting next week, working in an operating and grant-making foundation, I will have to retrain parts of my brain. That may not make me a big man on hippocampus, but it means less of the horizon-gazing that required me to take positions on everything going on in the world; instead, a welcome verticalism will drive me to dig more deeply into specific areas of interest. Fewer lone-wolf assertions; more collegial dealing. I hear that's tough.
 But retraining and fresh stimulation are what all of us should require in ''the last of life, for which the first was made.'' Athletes and dancers deal with the need to retrain in their 30's, workers in their 40's, managers in their 50's, politicians in their 60's, academics and media biggies in their 70's. The trick is to start early in our careers the stress-relieving avocation that we will need later as a mind-exercising final vocation. We can quit a job, but we quit fresh involvement at our mental peril. 
 In this inaugural winter of 2005, the government in Washington is dividing with partisan zeal over the need or the way to protect today's 20-somethings' Social Security accounts in 2040. Sooner or later, we'll bite that bullet; personal economic security is freedom from fear.
 But how many of us are planning now for our social activity accounts? Intellectual renewal is not a vast new government program, and to secure continuing social interaction deepens no deficit. By laying the basis for future activities in the midst of current careers, we reject stultifying retirement and seize the opportunity for an exhilarating second wind. 
 Medical and genetic science will surely stretch our life spans. Neuroscience will just as certainly make possible the mental agility of the aging. Nobody should fail to capitalize on the physical and mental gifts to come. 
 When you're through changing, learning, working to stay involved -- only then are you through. ''Never retire.''

HEADLINE: Maine Ski Resort Tells Smokers They Can't Light Up (No, Not Even in the Cold)

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: RUMFORD, Me. 

 BODY:
Skiers atop Black Mountain here may find the clean, crisp air just a little cleaner this winter. 
 When Black Mountain opened for the season on Dec. 10, it became the first ski resort in the nation where tobacco use was banned everywhere, including the lodge, the alpine and cross-country trails, and the lifts, state and industry officials said.
 But it probably will not be the last.
 ''In many other areas, it's fairly common to say 'no smoking' in a building, but this is the first area to say 'no smoking' in parking lots, in base areas and on lifts,'' said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, a trade group in Lakewood, Colo. ''I think it's been noticed. I think it's the beginning of a trend I think you'll see more of.'' 
 Maine banned smoking last year in virtually all indoor spaces except hotel rooms, homes, smoke shops and privately chartered buses. Although ski resorts in Maine and throughout the country have been subject to local and state laws prohibiting smoking indoors, outside had always been fair territory for smokers. 
 Black Mountain, which bills itself as family-friendly, has prominently posted signs reading ''This is a tobacco-free facility.''
 Terrie Anne Bennett, the resort's general manager, said the goal was to protect children from second-hand smoke. Ms. Bennett conceived the policy last August after meeting with members of the River Valley Healthy Communities Coalition, a local group that promotes health and uses some of Maine's money from the 1998 tobacco settlement to help curb smoking.
 Anyone caught, for instance, passing time on a chairlift with a cigarette or spitting chewing tobacco into a snowbank is pulled aside and told that tobacco is prohibited.
 ''I'm not the smoking police or the chew police,'' Ms. Bennett said. ''I inform them why it's important to us, and people are very compliant.'' 
 Ms. Bennett said only a handful of people had been asked to snuff out their cigarettes, and all had complied. The resort has, however, received a number of complaints. 
 ''I've had one person say they're going to drive by the mountain and blow smoke out the window,'' Ms. Bennett said. ''If they feel that way, fine. We have nothing against smokers or tobacco products. We just want to have a safe environment for children to recreate.''
 Maine health officials have spent years trying to lower the state's smoking rate among young adults, the highest in the nation in 1996. Last year about one-quarter of 12th graders in the state and here in Oxford County said they smoked, according to Dr. Lani Graham, acting director of the Maine Bureau of Health. 
 The smoking ban meshed well with the mission of the nonprofit organization that operates Black Mountain, the Maine Winter Sports Center, which uses skiing to promote economic stability and a healthy lifestyle in rural Maine, said the center's president, Andy Shepard. The center's five other ski areas will probably follow suit, he added. 
 ''We weren't making this decision based on economics,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''Rather we chose to do it on, 'Is this good for us based on our mission?' And the answer is yes.''
 The decision may well keep away skiers like Stephen Helfer, a member of Cambridge Citizens for Smokers' Rights, a group based in Massachusetts that opposes legislation restricting tobacco use.
 ''I definitely wouldn't go there, no,'' Mr. Helfer said. ''If I did go there, I would certainly consider defying the rule because I think it's a form of petty tyranny. I've skied all over New England and the West and Europe and Asia over the course of 40 years, and this is a first. 
 ''They say smoking is unnatural, but it's ecological smugness,'' he said. ''They have lifts there using energy, which creates air pollution, and all the people going to Black Mountain are polluting with their cars.'' 
 But Susan Duka, 51, a teacher from Hanover, Me., who was sitting in the lodge at Black Mountain while her 12-year-old son, Matt, put on his ski boots, said she was happy that he would not be tempted to take up smoking at the resort, where he skis a few days a week. 
 ''I think there needs to be places where people can smoke,'' said Ms. Duka, a former smoker. ''But this is a family place. A lot of children are dropped off here, and it's comforting to know that that particular influence is not here.''

HEADLINE: Gray Matter and the Sexes: Still a Scientific Gray Area

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER and KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
When Lawrence H. Summers, the president of Harvard, suggested this month that one factor in women's lagging progress in science and mathematics might be innate differences between the sexes, he slapped a bit of brimstone into a debate that has simmered for decades. And though his comments elicited so many fierce reactions that he quickly apologized, many were left to wonder: Did he have a point? 
 Has science found compelling evidence of inherent sex disparities in the relevant skills, or perhaps in the drive to succeed at all costs, that could help account for the persistent paucity of women in science generally, and at the upper tiers of the profession in particular? 
 Researchers who have explored the subject of sex differences from every conceivable angle and organ say that yes, there are a host of discrepancies between men and women -- in their average scores on tests of quantitative skills, in their attitudes toward math and science, in the architecture of their brains, in the way they metabolize medications, including those that affect the brain. 
 Yet despite the desire for tidy and definitive answers to complex questions, researchers warn that the mere finding of a difference in form does not mean a difference in function or output inevitably follows. 
 ''We can't get anywhere denying that there are neurological and hormonal differences between males and females, because there clearly are,'' said Virginia Valian, a psychology professor at Hunter College who wrote the 1998 book ''Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women.'' ''The trouble we have as scientists is in assessing their significance to real-life performance.'' 
 For example, neuroscientists have shown that women's brains are about 10 percent smaller than men's, on average, even after accounting for women's comparatively smaller body size. 
 But throughout history, people have cited anatomical distinctions in support of overarching hypotheses that turn out merely to reflect the societal and cultural prejudices of the time.
 A century ago, the French scientist Gustav Le Bon pointed to the smaller brains of women -- closer in size to gorillas', he said -- and said that explained the ''fickleness, inconstancy, absence of thought and logic, and incapacity to reason'' in women.
 Overall size aside, some evidence suggests that female brains are relatively more endowed with gray matter -- the prized neurons thought to do the bulk of the brain's thinking -- while men's brains are packed with more white matter, the tissue between neurons. 
 To further complicate the portrait of cerebral diversity, new brain imaging studies from the University of California, Irvine, suggest that men and women with equal I.Q. scores use different proportions of their gray and white matter when solving problems like those on intelligence tests. 
 Men, they said, appear to devote 6.5 times as much of their gray matter to intelligence-related tasks as do women, while women rely far more heavily on white matter to pull them through a ponder. 
 What such discrepancies may or may not mean is anyone's conjecture.
 ''It is cognition that counts, not the physical matter that does the cognition,'' argued Nancy Kanwisher, a professor of neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 When they do study sheer cognitive prowess, many researchers have been impressed with how similarly young boys and girls master new tasks. 
 ''We adults may think very different things about boys and girls, and treat them accordingly, but when we measure their capacities, they're remarkably alike,'' said Elizabeth Spelke, a professor of psychology at Harvard. She and her colleagues study basic spatial, quantitative and numerical abilities in children ranging from 5 months through 7 years. 
 ''In that age span, you see a considerable number of the pieces of our mature capacities for spatial and numerical reasoning coming together,'' Dr. Spelke said. ''But while we always test for gender differences in our studies, we never find them.''
 In adolescence, though, some differences in aptitude begin to emerge, especially when it comes to performance on standardized tests like the SAT. While average verbal scores are very similar, boys have outscored girls on the math half of the dreaded exam by about 30 to 35 points for the past three decades or so. 
 Nor is the masculine edge in math unique to the United States. In an international standardized test administered in 2003 by the international research group Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to 250,000 15-year-olds in 41 countries, boys did moderately better on the math portion in just over half the nations. For nearly all the other countries, there were no significant sex differences. 
 But average scores varied wildly from place to place and from one subcategory of math to the next. Japanese girls, for example, were on par with Japanese boys on every math section save that of ''uncertainty,'' which measures probabilistic skills, and Japanese girls scored higher over all than did the boys of many other nations, including the United States. 
 In Iceland, girls broke the mold completely and outshone Icelandic boys by a significant margin on all parts of the test, as they habitually do on their national math exams. ''We have no idea why this should be so,'' said Almar Midvik Halldorsson, project manager for the Educational Testing Institute in Iceland.
 Interestingly, in Iceland and everywhere else, girls participating in the survey expressed far more negative attitudes toward math.
 The modest size and regional variability of the sex differences in math scores, as well as an attitudinal handicap that girls apparently pack into their No. 2 pencil case, convince many researchers that neither sex has a monopoly on basic math ability, and that culture rather than chromosomes explains findings like the gap in math SAT scores. 
 Yet Dr. Summers, who said he intended his remarks to be provocative, and other scientists have observed that while average math skillfulness may be remarkably analogous between the sexes, men tend to display comparatively greater range in aptitude. Males are much likelier than females to be found on the tail ends of the bell curve, among the superhigh scorers and the very bottom performers. 
 Among college-bound seniors who took the math SAT's in 2001, for example, nearly twice as many boys as girls scored over 700, and the ratio skews ever more male the closer one gets to the top tally of 800. Boys are also likelier than girls to get nearly all the answers wrong. 
 For Dr. Summers and others, the overwhelmingly male tails of the bell curve may be telling. Such results, taken together with assorted other neuro-curiosities like the comparatively greater number of boys with learning disorders, autism and attention deficit disorder, suggest to them that the male brain is a delicate object, inherently prone to extremes, both of incompetence and of genius. 
 But few researchers who have analyzed the data believe that men's greater representation among the high-tail scores can explain more than a small fraction of the sex disparities in career success among scientists. 
 For one thing, said Kimberlee A. Shauman, a sociologist at the University of California, Davis, getting a high score on a math aptitude test turns out to be a poor predictor of who opts for a scientific career, but it is an especially poor gauge for girls. Catherine Weinberger, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has found that top-scoring girls are only about 60 percent as likely as top-scoring boys to pursue science or engineering careers, for reasons that remain unclear. 
 Moreover, men seem perfectly capable of becoming scientists without a math board score of 790. Surveying a representative population of working scientists and engineers, Dr. Weinberger has discovered that the women were likelier than the men to have very high test scores. ''Women are more cautious about entering these professions unless they have very high scores to begin with,'' she said. 
 And this remains true even though a given score on standardized math tests is less significant for women than for men. Dr. Valian, of Hunter, observes that among women and men taking the same advanced math courses in college, women with somewhat lower SAT scores often do better than men with higher scores. ''The SAT's turn out to underpredict female and overpredict male performance,'' she said. Again, the reasons remain mysterious. 
 Dr. Summers also proposed that perhaps women did not go into science because they found it too abstract and cold-blooded, offering as anecdotal evidence the fact that his young daughter, when given toy trucks, had treated them as dolls, naming them ''Daddy truck'' and ''baby truck.'' 
 But critics dryly observed that men had a longstanding tradition of naming their vehicles, and babying them as though they were humans. 
 Yu Xie, a sociologist at the University of Michigan and a co-author with Dr. Shauman of ''Women in Science: Career Processes and Outcomes'' (2003), said he wished there was less emphasis on biological explanations for success or failure, and more on effort and hard work.
 Among Asians, he said, people rarely talk about having a gift or a knack or a gene for math or anything else. If a student comes home with a poor grade in math, he said, the parents push the child to work harder. 
 ''There is good survey data showing that this disbelief in innate ability, and the conviction that math achievement can be improved through practice,'' Dr. Xie said, ''is a tremendous cultural asset in Asian society and among Asian-Americans.''
 In many formerly male-dominated fields like medicine and law, women have already reached parity, at least at the entry levels. At the undergraduate level, women outnumber men in some sciences like biology. 
 Thus, many argue that it is unnecessary to invoke ''innate differences'' to explain the gap that persists in fields like physics, engineering, mathematics and chemistry. Might scientists just be slower in letting go of baseless sexism?
 C. Megan Urry, a professor of physics and astronomy at Yale who led the American delegation to an international conference on women in physics in 2002, said there was clear evidence that societal and cultural factors still hindered women in science. 
 Dr. Urry cited a 1983 study in which 360 people -- half men, half women -- rated mathematics papers on a five-point scale. On average, the men rated them a full point higher when the author was ''John T. McKay'' than when the author was ''Joan T. McKay.'' There was a similar, but smaller disparity in the scores the women gave.
 Dr. Spelke, of Harvard, said, ''It's hard for me to get excited about small differences in biology when the evidence shows that women in science are still discriminated against every stage of the way.'' 
 A recent experiment showed that when Princeton students were asked to evaluate two highly qualified candidates for an engineering job -- one with more education, the other with more work experience -- they picked the more educated candidate 75 percent of the time. But when the candidates were designated as male or female, and the educated candidate bore a female name, suddenly she was preferred only 48 percent of the time. 
 The debate is sure to go on. 
 Sandra F. Witelson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, said biology might yet be found to play some role in women's careers in the sciences. 
 ''People have to have an open mind,'' Dr. Witelson said.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about claims that brain differences between men and women may affect their success in math and science careers referred incorrectly to a 1983 study finding that when college students were shown identical academic papers, they tended give higher ratings to those they were told were by a man. The papers judged in the study were about politics, education and the psychology of women, not mathematics.

HEADLINE: A Bright Diaspora Star Fails to Dazzle Israel

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Stanley Fischer, a widely respected American economist and banker, has agreed to leave the United States and a job as a vice chairman of Citigroup to become governor of the Bank of Israel, taking Israeli citizenship in the process.
 Does that make Israelis proud? Don't be so sure.
 Mr. Fischer's appointment, like everything here, has been caught up in politics. He has also been subject to some Israelis' deep ambivalence about Israel's relationship to Jews abroad. 
 On one hand, Israel wants to be a light unto the nations and attract the best and brightest Jews from around the world -- the Zionist dream of Theodor Herzl. Mr. Fischer, who is a Zionist and speaks reasonably good Hebrew, is making a significant financial sacrifice to make aliyah. The word is the Hebrew term for immigration to Israel that literally means a rising up, or ascent.
 On the other hand, some Israelis resent the fact that the leader of one of its most important institutions was recruited abroad and is someone who may have distinguished himself in a much bigger pool but has not been through the army or the other various trials of Israeli life.
 Ari Shavit, a writer for the daily Haaretz, went so far as to call Mr. Fischer's appointment morally unacceptable no matter how fine an economist he was or how good a job he would do. ''A person cannot shape the destiny of a community of which he has not been a part until now,'' Mr. Shavit wrote. 
 It is bad enough, Mr. Shavit wrote, that the largest private bank in Israel is owned ''by a cruise-ship heiress from Florida,'' Shari Arison, chairwoman of Arison Holdings. ''The possibility that the government bank will now be handed over to a guest governor from Manhattan is simply intolerable.''
 The tempest is partly about politics and economic policy. Mr. Fischer, who declined an interview request, was chosen at the last minute in a deal between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his finance minister and rival within the Likud Party, Benjamin Netanyahu.
 Mr. Netanyahu has been pushing the economy away from its socialist roots, confronting major unions and government ministries, and trying to revise the tax system. Mr. Fischer, who has many years of experience at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, is considered a strong advocate of opening markets and fostering economic competition. 
 He is perhaps best known for guiding the monetary fund during the Asian and Russian financial collapses in 1997 and 1998.
 ''Fischer has a very liberal, capitalist and nonsocialist agenda,'' said Omer Moav, a senior fellow at the Shalem Center and a senior lecturer in economics at Hebrew University. ''He believes in markets, small government and that people should work for their living. That's why Netanyahu brought him in.'' 
 So those who dislike Mr. Netanyahu and his policies, which include a significant part of the political center and the left in Israel, do not much like the fact of Mr. Fischer, who despite his personal politics -- he has been a supporter of the dovish Peace Now movement -- will bring further international standing and credibility to one side of a domestic policy battle. To shoot at Mr. Fischer, then, is to shoot at Mr. Netanyahu.
 Of course there are those, including financial journalists of various stripes, who were pushing their own choices and found reasons to criticize a choice from outside.
 For Shlomo Avineri, an internationally renowned political philosopher and former Foreign Ministry official, the fuss is reflective of a deeper Israeli ambivalence toward successful Jews in the rest of the world, who are a source of both pride and resentment.
 ''Israel wants aliyah, immigration, and we always ask why don't thousands of American academics come here,'' Mr. Avineri said. ''But on the other hand, they will take our jobs. In general, Israel hasn't attracted a lot of top-drawer immigrants. We've been the country of refuge, which takes in the poor or the downtrodden, from North Africa or Iraq or the Soviet Union, and gives them room in our house.''
 ''And then suddenly someone comes to rule the natives, and the relationship is reversed,'' he said. ''Israelis are not used to this.''
 Avinoam Bar-Yosef, who directs the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute, which studies the diaspora, said: ''Israel's main asset is the Jewish brain and the support of the Jewish world. To our sorrow, the majority of Jews in the world don't live here, and at the top of our agenda is to attract the best and brightest to join us.''
 Imagine, he said, if Steven Spielberg came to Israel, or Henry Kissinger. ''It would be like living in the days of the Messiah,'' he said.
 Some of the complaints about Mr. Fischer stem from professional frustration and others come from people with financial interests, who may find it harder to call a prominent stranger to lobby him. 
 ''And of course others say to live in Israel is a burden,'' Mr. Bar-Yosef said. ''You pay a price to live here. You go through the army. And you don't need to bring stars from outside who haven't been through the same experience.''
 Somehow, he said, Israel understands the need for imports in sports. Israeli basketball, for instance, would not be the same without them, and Israel's Olympic team has been greatly strengthened by immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
 Mr. Fischer's own Zionism, as a youngster and a volunteer on a kibbutz, should not be underestimated, Mr. Bar-Yosef said. ''Perhaps he thought of aliyah as a young person and it didn't work, and sometimes it doesn't,'' he said. ''But now he has an opportunity to complete a dream.''
 Stefanie Pearson, 33, an American who made aliyah four years ago, said Mr. Fischer should be an inspiration. ''He lived the American dream, and he is willing to come and run the bank of a very small country,'' she said. ''He's a reminder to us of what Israel is.'' 
 ''Israel shouldn't just be the country where Jews go when there is no other place to go,'' she said. ''Herzl believed Israel would inspire a renaissance in Judaism and draw Jews here. Instead of people being wounded by Fischer's choice, they should be inspired by it.''

HEADLINE: Freedom Rings, But the Bills Don't Get Paid

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
IN his inaugural address on Thursday, President Bush repeatedly invoked freedom and liberty, telling his fellow citizens that spreading liberty around the world was ''the calling of our time.''
 The more direct needs of people back home got five presidential sentences. Mr. Bush never spoke about, say, the freedom of knowing that the rent will be paid, that the refrigerator will be full, that car payments or a round-trip subway ride won't be a burden. Health insurance got merely a glancing reference. 
 Maybe the president plans to discuss those matters in another speech. If so, he could do some research in New York, where, even as the city rebounds and makes inroads into homelessness, some people are left behind. 
 The latest city statistics show, for instance, that the number of people visiting food pantries and kitchens that get city support (only part of the emergency food network) grew between November 2003 and November 2004 -- to 1,034,415 from 885,400. 
 The issue is complicated. The number of New Yorkers who use food programs began to increase with the economic downturn just before Sept. 11, 2001, and has continued to grow. The statistics reflect unemployment rates, the high cost of living, the large numbers of immigrants -- many of them unskilled and undocumented -- and the growing sophistication of the system itself, program directors say.
 They also say that in most cases people who go to food pantries for groceries (food kitchens serve meals) are not hungry. They are needy. ''It's sustenance,'' said Jeffrey Ambers, executive director of the Yorkville Common Pantry on East 109th Street. ''It's to supplement their income.'' 
 Food programs, largely government-financed, have grown and become institutionalized around the country -- an unofficial but crucial part of the social welfare system, relied on not just by the chronic poor, but by the working poor. Estimates show that slightly more than a quarter of the people who visit the city's food pantries have jobs.
 A recent study by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger shows that about the same percentage are on Social Security or Supplemental Security Income, while 18 percent are on welfare. ''The term now used is 'food insecurity,''' said Doreen Wohl, the executive director of the program, on West 86th Street. ''People who can't pay all of their household bills will come to food programs because they can get free food that helps free up money for those other necessities.''
 Some of those New Yorkers were lined up outside the Yorkville Common Pantry on Saturday as the snow began to fall.
 ''It's hard to make ends meet,'' explained Elaine Sparkman, a hospital claims worker. She supports her mother and disabled sister, and finds that her salary of about $26,000 a year doesn't go far enough. ''The expenses -- transit went up, food. This comes in handy,'' she said of the groceries.
 People get one to four bags of groceries at Yorkville, depending on family size. On Saturday, each bag contained cans of juice, vegetables, fruit, beans and soup, a small box of cereal, a pound of pasta, a quart of dried milk, a bag of potatoes or other fresh produce, a chicken, a loaf of bread. 
 Of course, some treat food programs as an entitlement, a crutch. On Saturday, a young man of 22, who would not give his name, said he needed the food because he had not found work. And if the pantry did not exist? ''I guess I'd look harder for a job.''
 OTHERS are among the chronically poor, like the man of 46 who looked 66, wore patched clothes and had liquor on his breath. He smiled and thanked everyone profusely and shuffled away. But many more are like Ms. Sparkman, coping with rising costs in New York, even of basic food. 
 Dorothy Gray, a home hospice attendant, said that without the pantry, ''I'd have to get public assistance.'' She turned to a volunteer. ''No potatoes?'' she asked. No, the potatoes were all gone. 
 Sam Williams, 20, said he couldn't get regular work as a roofer, so the groceries were a necessity: ''Nothing is enough.'' Monica, who would not give her last name, said she was laid off from a clerical job last year, and though she is doing temp work, she still struggles to pay her rent and medical insurance.
 ''Companies don't want to hire me because of health insurance,'' explained Monica, who is 59 and, it would seem, not enjoying all the freedoms the president wants to bring to the world.
 Sounds like a good subject for a political speech.

HEADLINE: Some See Risks for G.O.P. as It Revels in New Powers

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush begins his second term with the Republican Party in its strongest position in over 50 years, but his clout is already being tested by Republican doubts about his domestic agenda, rising national unease about Iraq and the threat of second-term overreaching, officials in both parties say.
 With this election producing a second-term Republican president and solid majorities in both the Senate and the House, Mr. Bush's party is more dominant than at any time since Herbert Hoover was elected in 1928. As Mr. Bush embarks on an explicit effort to put an imprint on politics and policy that will long outlast his presidency, his advisers are heady over what several described as an opportunity to make a long-lasting realignment in the nation's political balance of power. 
 But even those advisers said Mr. Bush had at most two years before he faced the ebb that historically saps the authority of a second-term incumbent, a relatively short time to sell his far-reaching agenda. And Republicans say his situation could be complicated by the absence of an obvious heir, opening the way for competing wings of the party to battle over details and tactics on the very issues Mr. Bush is embracing. 
 Richard Norton Smith, a presidential scholar who is director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, said the Republican Party had ''come closer now than they've been at any time in my lifetime'' to being the nation's majority party. But Mr. Smith said historical cycles over the past century suggested that its dominance might be coming to a close.
 ''The calendar alone tells you this conservative cycle is long in the tooth,'' he said. ''Add to that the divisions, or latent divisions, that exist with your own coalition. Once Bush is removed from the scene, and once he becomes in effect a lame duck, all those tensions are there.''
 The White House has described the election results as a mandate, and in his Inaugural Address on Thursday, Mr. Bush laid out his vision in sweeping terms.
 But some Republicans said they were worried about overconfidence, including Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who invoked his experience serving alongside Speaker Newt Gingrich when Republicans captured the House in 1994. ''Hubris is deadly,'' Mr. Sanford said.
 And Gary Bauer, a conservative who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, said that while he applauded Mr. Bush's ambition in pursuing two major domestic goals -- overhauling Social Security and the tax code -- those issues, if handled incorrectly, could undercut Mr. Bush's long-term goal for the party.
 ''They could provide the president's opponents with fodder for some of the old canards, that Republicans don't want a social safety net, that they're the party of the rich, all those things,'' Mr. Bauer said. ''It's going to take a very astute effort and massive amounts of presidential involvement to keep that from happening.'' 
 Mr. Bush got a reminder on the Sunday talk shows of the difficulties he faces, as Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who is talking about running for president, said on ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC that he did not believe the White House had a strategy to extricate the United States from Iraq. On ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, Representative Bill Thomas of California, the head of the Ways and Means Committee, laid out his own ideas for how to change the retirement system, which were to a large degree different from what the White House has suggested.
 Democrats, even while struggling with their own party divisions and confusion, are showing signs of coalescing into an aggressive opposition party, especially on issues like judicial appointments and Social Security. 
 Mr. Bush has repeatedly overcome doubts about his ability to win approval of controversial proposals. And his political advisers are confident going into this second term. They say that the party is poised to at least begin the broad political realignment and the diminishment of the Democratic Party that has been a goal of Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, Karl Rove.
 ''It is now fair to say that today the Republican Party is the dominant party in America,'' said Ken Mehlman, the new Republican National Committee chairman. ''It's not a deep majority, it is not a broad majority, but it is a very strong majority.'' 
 ''Now what does that mean?'' Mr. Mehlman continued in an interview at his new office on Capitol Hill. ''We're certainly not in the position that F.D.R. Democrats were in the 1930's and 40's. We're not the overwhelming favorite. There are going to be challenges. We're going to lose elections sometime. But it does mean we're in a very strong position.''
 Before 2001, the last time Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress was 1953. Gary Jacobson, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, argued that given the longevity and margins of Republican control in the House and Senate over the past decade, this was the most powerful period the party had enjoyed since 1928, the year Hoover was elected and Republicans held 56 Senate seats and 267 House seats. The numbers now are 55 and 232.
 With this presidential election, the Democrats lost a nearly 30-year advantage in party identification in presidential elections; in a survey of voters leaving the polls, 37 percent said they were Republican and 37 percent said they were Democrats. Mr. Bush won by nearly three million votes, after losing the popular vote last time. He drew more than 11 million more votes than in 2000; by contrast, Mr. Kerry drew about 8 million more votes than Al Gore, the Democratic candidate in 2000.
 It is a sign of Republican ascendance that the party is already forcing its opponents to re-examine some of their most strongly held positions. Democrats, for example, have been openly discussing whether to decrease their emphasis on one of their touchstone issues, abortion rights, after an election in which Mr. Bush ran aggressively as an opponent of abortion. 
 Still, Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic National Committee chairman, disputed the long-term meaning of the gains, arguing Democrats would have won the White House had 60,000 votes shifted in Ohio, and said Mr. Bush had enjoyed a ''huge advantage'' because of the attacks of Sept. 11.
 ''George Bush is in serious difficulties on Social Security, tax reform, all the cornerstones of the Bush agenda that the Republicans can't agree on,'' Mr. McAuliffe said.
 And even Republicans acknowledge there are questions about the durability and significance of the changes taking place. Most fundamentally, it is difficult today to measure whether the Republican successes of 2002 and 2004 were merely a ratification of Mr. Bush himself -- a president running for re-election in wartime -- or the start of a long-lasting shift to the Republican Party.
 ''It's still a story waiting to be told,'' Matthew Dowd, a senior Bush campaign adviser, said. ''You can't say after a national election that you won by 2.7 percent nationally, and a lot of states were close, that the Republican Party is going to be dominant.''
 The critical question for Mr. Bush, his advisers and Democrats say, is the success or failure of his agenda, both in terms of getting it through Congress and winning support for it from the public. Recent polls show apprehension about important aspects of his Social Security plan, and an overwhelming sentiment that Mr. Bush does not know how to end the war in Iraq, which is increasingly unpopular.
 And Governor Sanford of South Carolina pointed to the public perception of an economy in trouble, saying, ''If we were to see some sort of storm in our economy, well, there are advantages to holding all the cards, and there are disadvantages.'' 
 Republican leaders say the challenge now is to deliver on the ambitious agenda Mr. Bush set out in the 2004 campaign. He is trying to persuade Congress and the American people to embrace his plan to reshape Social Security by adding private investment accounts and to create a new tax system that rewards more saving and investment. He wants to reduce the costs that lawsuits and regulations impose on businesses and put more conservative judges in the nation's courtrooms.
 Against the backdrop of continued violence in Iraq, he is seeking to rally the nation behind a national security policy that is at once pre-emptive, interventionist and wrapped in a moral imperative to spread freedom.
 If he can succeed at all or even most of those undertakings, and those changes leave voters feeling more prosperous and secure, it could usher in an enduring change in the balance of political power in the nation, Mr. Bush's aides say. If he fails, Republicans may well remember this moment as little more than a fleeting alignment of the political stars: the short-lived victory of an incumbent president running for re-election in wartime against an unsteady opponent and a weakened opposition party.
 David Mayhew, a professor of political science at Yale, suggested that Mr. Bush's task was not easy and that the historical import of his victory had been overstated.
 ''I do not think this is a lasting, mountainous achievement in terms of building coalitions,'' Professor Mayhew said. ''Knowing what we know now, the presidential election of 2008 is probably a tossup.''

HEADLINE: For the Wrongly Convicted, New Trials Once the Cell Opens

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
This month marks one year since Nick Yarris was released from prison after having spent 23 years behind bars, many of them in solitary confinement and on death row, for a murder he did not commit.
 DNA testing proved his innocence. Upon his release, he was given no money, no housing, no training, no therapy. And no apology. 
 But he is not an angry or bitter man. In fact, Mr. Yarris, 43, is remarkably composed and articulate in discussing his fate and that of others who have been released after wrongful conviction. They are featured in a new documentary, ''After Innocence,'' at the Sundance Film Festival, where viewers leaped to their feet, many in tears, at the end of the first screening on Saturday.
 ''What were my choices?'' he said after seeing the film for the first time, when asked how he could seem so sane. ''I could, A) be really devastated and angry and let them continue to own me, or B) I could have fun. B sounds better.''
 He continued: ''I realized at some point that everyone in my family was waiting for me, hoping for me. The lowest insult would be if I came out destroyed, a broken man, bitter and angry. And it was survival. My survival technique was to become a good man.''
 For all his eloquence, Mr. Yarris is far from on solid ground. He still has no job, no permanent home and no money. Still, he is in much better condition emotionally than many of the other exonerees featured in the film, all of whom were released, often after years of struggling to get DNA testing in their cases, with no amends by the state.
 (More than a dozen states have passed laws providing compensation for convicts who are later exonerated, though most of the men in the film, including Mr. Yarris, who is from Pennsylvania, are from states that have none.)
 Jessica Sanders, the film's director as well as its co-producer and screenwriter, met 30 exonerees at a conference in 2002. ''I was so moved by the stories of these men, and shocked that nothing was being done for them,'' she said. ''I knew that a film had to be made.'' 
 Showtime developed the project, though the producers are also seeking a theatrical distributor.
 Ms. Sanders was introduced to the men through the film's co-producer and writer, Marc Simon, who as a law student volunteered at the Innocence Project, a nonprofit group run by Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld that focuses on freeing the innocent, frequently through DNA testing.
 While that effort continues -- the group has helped free more than 150 wrongfully convicted inmates in the last 13 years -- there has been little attention to what happens to the men after their release. Some depend on welfare and on their already burdened families.
 ''Without their families, these guys would be homeless,'' Mr. Simon said. 
 Wilton Dedge, a soft-spoken, blond-haired man, was released five months ago after serving 22 years in prison in Florida for sexual battery and burglary. In 2001, DNA tests of a hair, a central piece of material evidence in his conviction, proved it was not his, but the prosecution continued to fight to keep him in jail. More advanced DNA testing of semen won his release last year.
 ''If the state had their way, I'd still be in jail,'' Mr. Dedge said quietly, nursing a beer at the post-screening lunch. ''They don't want to admit they messed up.''
 Mr. Dedge learned welding in prison and since his release has found some part-time work for a tree service. ''All I got was a basic form letter apologizing for what happened, not admitting they did anything wrong,'' he said. ''But it seemed pretty hollow, after all the names they called me in court. They weren't man enough to step forward and apologize to my face. That disappointed me.''
 Last October, Mr. Yarris traveled to London to address the British Parliament about the death penalty and his proposal for an economic embargo against Pennsylvania. While there, he met Karen Karbritz, 30. They plan to be married in May, and he hopes to start a new life with her in England.
 ''I'm going to go, to try my best to have the things I wanted,'' he said, adding, ''I was waiting, hoping for a chance just to live. Now the greatest respect I can have for her for trusting me is by loving her, and to thank her just for holding me.''

HEADLINE: American Express Posts Gain of 17%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that profit rose 17 percent last quarter, the biggest jump in two years, as rising consumer confidence spurred record card use.
 Net income climbed to $896 million, or 71 cents a share, from $763 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier, the company said. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial predicted earnings per share of 70 cents on average.
 American Express, which is based in New York, has increased quarterly earnings by more than 10 percent for three years, the longest streak of any company in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average. 
 The company added 4.9 million cardholders, an 8.1 percent gain that brought the total to 65.4 million. Outstanding card balances rose 7.2 percent, to $46.5 billion. Revenue increased 10 percent, to $7.77 billion, and expenses were $6.6 billion, an 11 percent jump.
 Cost-cutting during the quarter included the elimination of 2,000 jobs and the sale of units in Bangladesh, Egypt, Luxembourg and Pakistan. The reorganization resulted in costs of $102 million, the company said.
 ''Record levels of card member spending along with higher client-asset levels generated double-digit revenue growth throughout the year,'' Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive, said.
 American Express shares rose 1.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest gain in more than a month, and closed at $52.60.

HEADLINE: Justices Back Full Taxation Of Awards

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the full amount of a court award or legal settlement is taxable to the successful plaintiff, even if a sizable portion goes directly to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement.
 The lower federal courts have been split on the question. Acting on government appeals in two cases, the justices voted 8 to 0, with the ailing Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist not participating, to overturn decisions by the federal appeals courts in San Francisco and Cincinnati. Both courts had rejected the Internal Revenue Service's position that all economic gain is taxable to the person who has earned it, unless specifically exempted by Congress. 
 Shortly before the cases were argued in November, Congress changed the tax law in favor of a subcategory of lawsuit-winning taxpayers. Under that law, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, taxpayers can deduct lawyers' fees and court costs ''in connection with any action involving a claim of unlawful discrimination.'' Discrimination is broadly defined to include many kinds of employment disputes.
 Writing for the court on Monday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the new law would probably have applied to the cases at issue, both involving employment-related lawsuits. But the law is not retroactive and does not apply to other kinds of lawsuits. Consequently, the Justice Department had urged the court not to find the cases moot.
 John W. Banks II, the plaintiff in one of the cases, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Banks, No. 03-892, settled an employment discrimination case against the California Department of Education for $464,000, with $150,000 of that going to his lawyer under their fee agreement. 
 In the other case, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Banaitis, No. 03-907, Sigitas J. Banaitis, a former vice president of the Bank of California, won a jury award of $4.9 million in compensatory and punitive damages in an employment dispute against the bank. The defendant paid an additional $3.9 million directly to his lawyer.
 Legal expenses can generally be counted as miscellaneous itemized deductions. But their awards made both men subject to the alternative minimum tax, which eliminates miscellaneous itemized deductions. Under the new legislation, the deductions may be taken even when the alternative tax applies.
 In his opinion in favor of the I.R.S., Justice Kennedy cited the long-established rule that ''a taxpayer cannot exclude an economic gain from gross income by assigning the gain in advance to another party,'' even if the assignment was a valid business arrangement that was not undertaken for the purpose of avoiding taxes.

HEADLINE: Tracing Drift Of Terrorism As It Evolves

BYLINE: By ERIC MINK. 
Eric Mink is commentary editor and an op-ed columnist at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He has written about television for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
In the battle against Islamist terrorism, Xavier Raufer, a French expert on terrorism and international crime, fears that the Bush administration is 20 years behind the curve.
 ''They describe this as some kind of an Irish Republican Army, except that instead of being Catholics, they are Muslims,'' Mr. Raufer says on ''Al Qaeda's New Front,'' a documentary that has its premiere tonight on PBS's ''Frontline'' series. ''This is 1980's terrorism,'' he tells the program's correspondent, Lowell Bergman, who is also a correspondent for The New York Times. ''It has nothing to do with what terrorism is today.'' 
 ''Al Qaeda's New Front'' suggests that the splintering of Islamist terrorism into widely dispersed, more-or-less independent units is an evolutionary adaptation to Al Qaeda's eviction from Afghanistan three years ago by United States military forces. It focuses on the countries of Western Europe -- especially Spain, Britain and France -- to which vast numbers of Muslims have been migrating for at least two decades.
 ''Most Muslims in Europe are devout, conservative and opposed to the fanaticism of the militant Islamists,'' the program acknowledges, but their relative isolation within the broader cultures around them helps create conditions ripe for exploitation by astute extremist recruiters.
 The problem is magnified by the spread of virulent strains of Salafi, a fundamentalist variant of Sunni Islam. Particularly ominous, the program notes, is the increasing number of adherents to the Takfir wal Hijra version of Salafi, which approves of any tactic, no matter how violent, against nonbelievers, including other Muslims.
 The documentary succumbs to movie-making temptation in a couple of spots. An opening sequence about the bombings of commuter trains in Madrid last March marries newly shot scenes with surveillance video of the actual explosions. The editing is so seamless that it carries the program needlessly close to the line between legitimate illustration and inappropriate staging. A later simulation of a stakeout, complete with mood music and an ostensibly dramatic close-up of images in a car's rearview mirror, likewise undercuts the film's seriousness.
 It is also hard to justify the program's use of audio recorded during the beheading of the 26-year-old American hostage Nicholas Berg in Iraq last May. Although the sounds are heard in a segment about the recruitment of a suicide bomber, they add nothing of value to the program. 
 Those lapses notwithstanding, ''Al Qaeda's New Front'' makes a vivid contribution to the understanding of Western Europe as both an incubator and a target of contemporary Islamist terrorism.
 ''This is an ideal breeding ground,'' explains Mamoun Abdelali, a Muslim who lives in Paris. Among the factors he cites are ''unemployment, ignorance, academic failures, professional failures, a feeling of rejection by French society because there is no work or housing.'' He also points to ''a very low education level and thus very little knowledge of Islam.''
 The Bush administration's description of the war in Iraq as the central battle in the war against terrorism has raised doubts about its understanding of the mutating Islamist threat, particularly in Europe. In the aftermath of last year's bombings in Madrid, the ''Frontline'' program states, ''Many Europeans, already wary of the Iraq war, were worried that the United States, by pursuing a mainly military campaign against Al Qaeda, had underestimated the evolving nature of the threat.'' 
 ''Al Qaeda's New Front'' is a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation production by Neil Docherty for ''Frontline'' in association with The New York Times. A program titled ''War Without Borders,'' which used much of the same material, was broadcast in Canada in December.

HEADLINE: Pataki Makes His Fiscal Case To a Conservative Audience

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
With speculation in political circles that he is considering a run for president, Gov. George E. Pataki sought last night to shore up his conservative bona fides before an influential conservative group with a slide show and a forceful defense of fiscal policies that he said had helped control state spending.
 Mr. Pataki appeared at the Monday Meeting, an exclusive gathering of some of the city's most conservative political donors, activists, journalists and opinionmakers. 
 The group's visitors in the two and a half years of its existence have included a wide range of political leaders, including presidential cabinet members and numerous members of Congress. But until last night, Mr. Pataki was not one of them.
 His appearance came as speculation swirls about his ambitions. His third term is up in 2006, and he has not announced his intentions. He has faced criticism from some conservatives, traditionally an important base of support, who say he has not reined in state spending as tightly as he could.
 Mr. Pataki said he decided to appear before the group merely to highlight his state budget. He did that and then some. He spoke for nearly a half hour, well beyond the normally allotted 5 or 10 minutes for guest speakers. 
 ''Going into this year's budget battle, which I know will be a battle, I wanted to make sure people appreciate the philosophy and the ideas behind it,'' Mr. Pataki said afterward.
 Mr. Pataki received a polite response from the group. A handful of the 100 or so people in the room, at the Grand Hyatt in Midtown Manhattan, rose to applaud when he entered, and some laughed at his few asides at the expense of adversaries. Afterward, he chatted for a few minutes with a small group before departing.
 During his presentation, complete with charts flashed on a screen, Mr. Pataki portrayed himself as a careful fiscal steward hamstrung by legislators bent on raising taxes. 
 ''We have the single worst legislative body in America,'' he said, later signaling out the Democratic-controlled Assembly as particularly obstructive to his efforts.
 Mr. Pataki lingered particularly long over a chart showing a vast improvement in the state's credit rating from Standard & Poor's.
 ''You don't have to believe me; I'm a politician,'' he said with a grin. ''This is Wall Street's analysis of my fiscal stewardship.''
 Though some fiscal analysts give heavy credit to the improving economy, Mr. Pataki stressed his role in managing the state budget.
 His latest budget, the 11th of his tenure, is a $105.5 billion proposal, released last week, that increases state spending by 2.4 percent, which he said was less than the 2.7 percent rate of inflation. The increase was due largely to health care and other costs, his aides have said.
 But analysts have disputed the picture, suggesting that spending is actually higher, and Mr. Pataki did not dwell on the $700 million in tax increases he has proposed, including a higher excise tax on wine and the extension of a tax on clothing and footwear priced under $110 that was supposed to end on May 31.
 Edmund J. McMahon, a policy analyst with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group with a close following among the audience Mr. Pataki addressed, has criticized the governor's budget -- as well as legislative action -- for what he called excessive spending. His analysis of the budget puts the increase in spending of state funds in Mr. Pataki's budget -- not counting federal aid -- at 5.4 percent.
 Mr. Pataki, while casting himself as an agent of change ''very proud of the fiscally conservative policies we have put in place,'' suggested that taxes and spending were still too high, but that contrary to what some critics say, he was not to blame.
 ''Back in 1994, when I was first running for governor, I believed a couple of things. One was that New York spent too much and another was that New York taxed too much,'' he said. ''It is now 2005, and I have a number of beliefs. One is that New York spends too much and another is New York taxes too much. I don't think there's ever been any question about that.''

HEADLINE: Judge Delays Killer's Death To Examine Competency

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
A federal judge issued a stay of execution on Monday for Michael Bruce Ross, 36 hours before Mr. Ross, a convicted serial killer, was scheduled to become the first person executed in New England since 1960. 
 The ruling, by Judge Robert N. Chatigny of United States District Court, climaxed a furious series of appeals by public defenders and death-penalty opponents in recent weeks that, until the ruling shortly after 2 p.m. on Monday, appeared unlikely to prevent Mr. Ross from his scheduled death by lethal injection at 2:01 a.m. Wednesday at Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers. 
 It also cleared the way for public defenders to press their claims in federal court that Mr. Ross was incompetent when he decided last year to forgo further appeals of his death sentence. In a series of rulings in state courts, including the State Supreme Court, public defenders were denied legal standing to make their claims, in part because Mr. Ross had dismissed them last year.
 ''In the state courts, we've lost at every turn,'' said the state chief public defender, Gerard A. Smyth, ''Finally, a highly respected federal judge has validated our position.''
 The chief state's attorney, Christopher L. Morano, filed an immediate appeal, and a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed to hear the case on Tuesday, raising the possibility of another turnabout. Mr. Ross's lawyer, T.R. Paulding, said he planned to meet with his client. 
 Judge Chatigny said he based his ruling on testimony Monday by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Stuart E. Grassian, who said in court that Mr. Ross appeared to be depressed and possibly inclined to irrational decisions after living in solitary confinement for many years. Mr. Ross, who has confessed to killing eight girls and young women and to raping many of them, was arrested in 1984.
 ''Having listened to the witness, there's no doubt in my mind that we have a genuine issue here, and it needs to be fully explored,'' Judge Chatigny said. 
 Dr. Grassian, who specializes in the impact confinement has on inmates, criticized an evaluation last month by another forensic psychiatrist who said Mr. Ross was competent, it ''uncritically'' accepted some of Mr. Ross's explanations for why he wanted to be executed. 
 Dr. Grassian said Mr. Ross, who has often said he wants to be executed to help heal the families of his victims, appeared to be masking a desire to commit suicide that he said is evident in essays Mr. Ross has published on the Internet and elsewhere. 
 ''He's stating this for public consumption, but they're not the real reasons,'' Dr. Grassian said.
 He read aloud from a widely distributed 1998 letter he said Mr. Ross wrote about why he wanted to be executed: ''The truth is I was driven more by a desire to end my own pain than out of any noble cause.'' 
 Dr. Grassian declined to offer a precise diagnosis without having examined Mr. Ross. But, he said, ''There is clearly something wrong with the man.''
 Judge Chatigny echoed Dr. Grassian's assertion that state courts may have found a ''comfort level'' in finding Mr. Ross competent based on the articulate testimony he offered in court appearances. Mr. Ross graduated from Cornell University in 1981 with a degree in economics.
 ''The comfort level one gets looking at Mr. Ross and listening to him may be ill founded,'' the judge said.

HEADLINE: In $8 Billion Restaurant Industry, a Study Finds Mostly 'Bad Jobs'

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
A new study of New York City's restaurant industry has found that at least 36 percent of its workers are illegal immigrants, that 59 percent of restaurant workers surveyed reported overtime violations, and that 73 percent said they had no health insurance.
 The study is scheduled for release today by the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, an advocacy group for restaurant workers. Assistance with the study was provided by numerous community groups, economists and sociologists. 
 According to the study, most of the city's more than 165,000 restaurant workers earned less than $20,000 a year and 13 percent reported minimum wage violations. The study also found that 33 percent of the city's restaurant workers reported verbal abuse by their employers and that 19 percent said management illegally took a share of the tips.
 ''While there are a few 'good' restaurant jobs in the restaurant industry, the majority are 'bad jobs,' characterized by low wages, few benefits and limited opportunities for upward mobility of increased income,'' the report concluded.
 The study, based on surveys of 530 restaurant workers and in-depth interviews with 35 restaurant executives and 45 workers, found that many restaurant executives said rent and other costs in New York were so high that they feared they would go out of business if they provided better wages and benefits. The study said the city had more than 15,000 food and drinking establishments with total revenue of more than $8 billion a year. 
 The study said fast food workers earned $6.99 an hour on average, restaurant dishwashers earned $7.64 an hour; waiters, $9.33 an hour; and cooks, $13.45 an hour. 
 E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the New York State Restaurant Association, questioned the survey's representation of the industry.
 He said restaurants played an important role in helping the city's immigrants, noting that ''the restaurant industry is one of the few industries that offer opportunities for new citizens and for people who have just come to this country.''
 According to the study, employers who were interviewed recognized that the wages they paid were barely enough to live on, but they said it would be extremely difficult to pay a living wage and still make a profit. The study quoted one restaurant executive who said providing health benefits would be extremely hard and could be the difference between staying in business and going under.
 The study called for stronger enforcement of wage and occupational safety laws and for government incentives, like tax breaks, to persuade restaurants to provide better wages and benefits.
 Saru Jayaraman, executive director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, which seeks to improve conditions for restaurant workers, said a major problem was that white workers were often given the highest-paying, front-of-the-house jobs like hostess or waiter, while Hispanic and Asian workers were often given the lowest paying, back-of-the-house jobs like dishwasher or prep cook. 
 Mr. Hunt, the industry official, condemned any minimum wage and overtime violations and denied that discrimination by race or by nationality was widespread in New York restaurants.

HEADLINE: White House Looking for Ways to Ease Opposition to Social Security Overhaul

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, facing opposition from Democrats and unease among Republicans over its plan to overhaul Social Security, is looking at new ideas for cutting future benefits that would hit wealthy retirees harder than those in the middle or bottom ranks of wage-earners, people involved in the discussions say.
 But despite signs of reluctance from Capitol Hill, the White House remains confident that it can find a consensus on legislation that President Bush can sign into law, administration officials and advisers to Mr. Bush said.
 People who have been briefed on White House discussions said the administration was striving to retain as much flexibility as possible both on legislative tactics and policy details. Deliberations are under way within the White House and between the White House and Republican leaders in Congress over how to proceed, they said, but there is no sense of panic or even surprise within the administration. 
 Over the last few weeks, the White House has seen the debate over Social Security take off, but not always in ways that appear helpful to Mr. Bush's goal of quick action to create personal investment accounts within the retirement system and deal with its long-term financing problems. 
 Democrats and interest groups like the AARP, the lobbying organization for older Americans, are rallying opposition to Mr. Bush's plans; on Monday, the AARP released a poll showing little public support for personal accounts once the costs and tradeoffs involved in establishing them are made clear. Republicans said the poll was flawed and gave a misleading view of public opinion.
 But Republicans are not entirely in sync with the White House, either. Representative Bill Thomas of California, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on Sunday that deliberations on Social Security should be broadened to include an overhaul of the tax code, and perhaps other issues, like the long-term-care needs for the elderly. He also suggested a re-examination of the retirement age, but cautioned that that would raise equity issues about gender, race and occupation. 
 Moderate Republicans like Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine have suggested they are unconvinced about the need to create personal accounts. 
 ''They're not upset about this,'' said one adviser to the White House, speaking on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Bush frowns on public disclosures of internal discussions. ''They've raised the topic, and now the topic has momentum. The White House figures it can impact the conversation as it goes ahead.''
 But White House officials have yet to decide a number of crucial and politically treacherous subjects, most particularly, the issue of cutting benefits to future retirees. Indeed, White House officials are locked in a debate about whether to even offer a detailed proposal to Congress.
 The White House has already floated one approach to the issue of future benefits, suggesting that the benefits be based on price increases rather than on the current formula, which is based on economy-wide growth in wages. Since wages tend to rise faster than prices, the effect would be to set benefits at lower levels than promised under current law.
 But that approach drew intense criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Administration officials are now reviewing an idea called ''progressive indexation.'' The idea is in effect a compromise that would allow initial benefits for low-income workers to rise in line with their wages but would peg benefits for affluent workers to the inflation rate.
 The effect would be to direct relatively more benefits to lower-income people than to higher-income people.
 White House officials say that future benefits have to be reduced in order to close a long-term financial gap that the government estimates at roughly $3.7 trillion over the next 75 years.
 Shifting from wage indexing to price indexing would in itself come close to eliminating the projected shortfall. 
 But such a change would mean Social Security would steadily replace less and less of a person's pre-retirement income.
 The new approach would help protect people at the lowest rungs of the income scale. But it would not save nearly as much money. By one estimate, it would close about two-thirds of the projected shortfall.
 ''They are trying to make the proposal more friendly to low-income workers,'' said David John, a senior analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization. ''The major problem is that if you don't do full price-indexing you don't get the full savings and you don't completely solve the problem.''
 The alternative idea was proposed by Robert Pozen, an investment executive in Boston who was a member of Mr. Bush's advisory commission on Social Security in 2001.
 White House and Treasury officials are studying computer analyses of that idea, Mr. Pozen said in an interview last week. 
 Michael Tanner, director of health and retirement issues at the Cato Institute, said White House officials were studying the idea as a possible solution but had not made any final decisions.
 ''We're all running a lot of different numbers,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who has sponsored legislation that would create private investment accounts.
 ''I have the numbers in my briefcase right now,'' Mr. Ryan said last Friday in a telephone interview from Wisconsin. But, he added, ''there are a lot of different ways of doing this.''

HEADLINE: Shares Slide After Oil Rises, Reviving Fear of Slowdown

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as oil prices climbed to an eight-week high, renewing concern that energy costs may weigh on earnings. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 24.38 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,368.61, a level not seen since Nov. 4. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.12 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,163.75, the lowest since Nov. 10.
 The Nasdaq composite index dropped 25.57 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,008.70. The index has dropped 4.6 percent in the last four days, its steepest such decline since August. 
 The S.&P. 500 is headed for its worst January since 2000, giving back half of its fourth-quarter increase, while the Nasdaq is 0.3 percent shy of wiping out its 2004 advance.
 Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.5 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, in line with the three-month daily average.
 Both the S.&P. 500 and the Dow opened higher and peaked after American Express reported sales and profit that exceeded analysts' estimates. The indexes retreated in the afternoon after oil prices, which bounced between gains and losses for most of the day, closed up.
 ''The market has reacted really badly each time we see crude oil move up,'' said James McBride, who helps manage $185 million at TrendStar Advisers in Overland Park, Kan. ''Higher energy prices across the board are going to cause a global economic slowdown.''
 Crude oil for March delivery added 0.6 percent, to $48.81 a barrel, in New York, the highest close since Nov. 30, after a report that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had reduced production as members followed through on pledges made six weeks ago to cut output.
 The Philadelphia semiconductor index declined 1.7 percent; all 19 of its members dropped. Infineon Technologies said a decline in chip prices and lower demand would crimp sales and profit this quarter.
 Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, slid 43 cents, to $21.99. Its 2 percent decline made it the Dow average's worst performer. Micron Technology, which makes memory chips, lost 35 cents, to $10.06.
 Autodesk, a maker of software to design buildings, also pushed the Nasdaq lower.
 Its shares tumbled $3.74, to $27.58, after a Banc of America Securities analyst, Hari Srinivasan, said in a report that Autodesk's sales growth may slow as fewer clients upgrade their programs. He cut the stock, the S.&P. 500's best performer last year, to sell from neutral.
 Shares of two large retailers also fell. Home Depot, the big home improvement chain, lost 51 cents, to $40.39. Its rival, Lowe's, fell 82 cents, to $55.09.
 Shares of Procter & Gamble, the nation's largest consumer goods maker, fell 44 cents, to $55.21. Shares are ''fairly valued'' relative to the company's prospects for earnings growth, a UBS analyst, Andrew McQuilling, wrote. He lowered his rating on the stock to neutral from buy.
 Prices of Treasuries were mixed yesterday. The price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32, to 101 2/32, pushing its yield to a five-week low of 4.12 percent, on expectations that slowing economic growth would keep inflation from accelerating. The note's price, which moves in the opposite direction from its yield, rose over the last two weeks as consumer confidence fell and manufacturing growth abated. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.413	98.680	High Rate	2.320	2.610	Investment Rate	2.366	2.682	Low Rate	2.280	2.580	Median Rate	2.300	2.600	Total applied for	$39,280,322	$39,584,247	Accepted	$26,005,580	$21,790,847	Noncompetitive	$1,616,775	$1,250,048	

Both issues are dated Jan. 27, 2005. The three-month bills mature on April 28, 2005 and the six-month bills mature on July 28, 2005.

HEADLINE: Cartoon Character . . . or Political Animal?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your editorial about SpongeBob SquarePants (''Nautical Nonsense,'' Jan. 22) missed the point about the condemnation of this cartoon character by Dr. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family. Similar challenges to fictitious characters have played a key role in the political strategy of conservative Republicans for years. 
 Dr. Dobson and other cultural conservatives exploit such dubious threats as SpongeBob SquarePants to illustrate their allegations of a liberal elite's assault on religion, family and children. 
 Moreover, they seize on the ridiculing of their critiques -- like your editorial -- to justify their crusades for ''traditional'' values. 
 These well-planned campaigns are designed to lead voters to overlook conservative policies and their own economic self-interest and vote for those who position themselves as defenders of cultural normalcy. After all, why should politicians address falling wages, prolonged unemployment, crashing pensions, evaporating unemployment insurance and outsourced jobs when you can get millions of voters to go for the cultural head fake and take out their anger on cartoon characters?

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Mexico: Trade Deficit Rises

BYLINE: By Elisabeth Malkin (NYT)

 BODY:
Mexico's trade deficit grew to $8.1 billion last year, the Finance Ministry said, as economic growth of at least 4 percent drove demand for imports. The increase in imports was partly offset by higher prices for Mexico's oil exports and more exports of manufactured goods. An estimated 90 percent of Mexico's $189 billion in exports last year went to the United States. Elisabeth Malkin (NYT)

HEADLINE: Let the Competition Begin

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
China is better known for making most of the world's sports shoes rather than wearing them, but the world's biggest athletic shoe brands are in a race here to change that.
 Adidas-Salomon announced Monday that it would be a major sponsor of the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008. Chinese athletes will wear the Adidas brand shoes and sportswear throughout the Games.
 The announcement was part of Adidas's ambitious hopes for China. The company, based in Germany, intends to increase its stores in China to 4,000 by 2008 from 1,300 now, and to expand its China revenues to more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) by the end of the decade. 
 ''We foresee by 2008 China could be the No.3, or with some push, No.2 market in the world,'' Christophe Bezu, the Adidas senior vice president for the Asia Pacific region, said at a news conference here. ''China clearly is the driver.'' Annual revenue from China currently stood at well over $130 million, he said.
 Rival sportswear brands like Reebok and Nike and other multinational corporations also have their eyes on China's increasingly affluent and image-conscious young consumers. They have recruited sports stars like Yao Ming, the Shanghai-born center of the Houston Rockets, and Liu Xiang, China's gold-medalist hurdler, as icons of a confident sports-loving nation. Nike's sales in China rose two-thirds in 2003 to $300 million.
 Chinese consumers now spend about $5 billion a year on sports merchandise and events, a sliver of the $200 billion or more spent in the United States every year, said Terry Rhoads, a former Nike marketing executive who is now general manager of Zou Marketing, a Shanghai company that advises on sports management and promotion.
 ''Perhaps there's more hype than opportunities,'' Mr. Rhoads said, ''but there's no doubt there's pent-up demand for sports in China.''
 Chinese city governments have also spied that opportunity, and many have spent heavily on new sports centers. Apart from Beijing's preparations for the 2008 Olympics, Shanghai has spent heavily on Formula One racetracks and tennis courts for international meets.
 But more than income and budgets stand in the way of turning China into a major sports market, experts say. As in many other areas of the economy, multinational companies hoping to profit from China's growth must contend with bureaucracies that want to profit from their involvement, but show only flickering awareness of customers and market competition.
 ''Sports in China are still greatly controlled by the government,'' Mr. Rhoads said in an interview. ''The toughest thing the government is grappling with is that sports are entertainment.''
 But sports executives said that making China's sports administration more responsive to fans and consumers might be a long and troublesome process. Adidas sponsors China's soccer league, which has almost collapsed amid internal disputes between club managers and game officials, as well as charges of match fixing.
 ''It's the shenanigans around the sports that cause fans to lose interest,'' Mr. Rhoads said.
 The government's reach into sports clubs means that little attention is given to making sports stadiums comfortable and convenient, and spicing up matches with midmatch entertainment, Mr. Rhoads said. China's premier soccer league regularly draws a few thousand spectators to games in stadiums that can seat tens of thousands, and last year China's national basketball league attracted only $1 million for television broadcast rights to its games.
 Multinational companies are instead tending to promote themselves through international events in Beijing or Shanghai, like games between American basketball teams and the Shanghai tennis open, Mr. Rhoads said.
 Chinese sports experts also said Chinese participation in sports is more restricted than in the United States or Europe. Multinational investors are hoping to encourage a youth culture devoted to sports by sponsoring high school basketball contests and university soccer leagues.
 Yu Jie, the acting director of the Fudan University FUON Sports Marketing Center in Shanghai, said that during a two-year stay in the United States she was struck by the relatively widespread participation of high school students in team sports, whereas Chinese students are so busy studying for a series of rigorous exams they have little time for sports. 
 ''Here in China kids have lots of exam pressures, so they don't have the same opportunities to participate in team sports,'' Professor Yu said in a phone interview. ''Kids like to play, but there are limits on their opportunities.''

HEADLINE: The Sticky Ladder

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In his Inaugural Address President Bush embraced the grandest theme of American foreign policy -- the advance of freedom around the world. Now that attention is turning to the State of the Union address, it would be nice if he would devote himself as passionately to the grandest theme of domestic policy -- social mobility.
 The United States is a country based on the idea that a person's birth does not determine his or her destiny. Our favorite stories involve immigrants climbing from obscurity to success. Our amazing work ethic is predicated on the assumption that enterprise and effort lead to ascent. ''I hold the value of life is to improve one's condition,'' Lincoln declared. 
 The problem is that in every generation conditions emerge that threaten to close down opportunity and retard social mobility. Each generation has to reopen the pathways to success.
 Today, for example, we may still believe American society is uniquely dynamic, but we're deceiving ourselves. European societies, which seem more class riven and less open, have just as much social mobility as the United States does.
 And there are some indications that it is becoming harder and harder for people to climb the ladder of success. The Economist magazine gathered much of the recent research on social mobility in America. The magazine concluded that the meritocracy is faltering: ''Would-be Horatio Algers are finding it no easier to climb from rags to riches, while the children of the privileged have a greater chance of staying at the top of the social heap.''
 Economists and sociologists do not all agree, but it does seem there is at least slightly less movement across income quintiles than there was a few decades ago. Sons' income levels correlate more closely to those of their fathers. The income levels of brothers also correlate more closely. That suggests that the family you were born into matters more and more to how you will fare in life. That's a problem because we are not supposed to have a hereditary class structure in this country.
 But we're developing one. In the information age, education matters more. In an age in which education matters more, family matters more, because as James Coleman established decades ago, family status shapes educational achievement. 
 At the top end of society we have a mass upper-middle class. This is made up of highly educated people who move into highly educated neighborhoods and raise their kids in good schools with the children of other highly educated parents. These kids develop wonderful skills, get into good colleges (the median family income of a Harvard student is now $150,000), then go out and have their own children, who develop the same sorts of wonderful skills and who repeat the cycle all over again. 
 In this way these highly educated elites produce a paradox -- a hereditary meritocratic class.
 It becomes harder for middle-class kids to compete against members of the hypercharged educated class. Indeed, the middle-class areas become more socially isolated from the highly educated areas.
 And this is not even to speak of the children who grow up in neighborhoods in which more boys go to jail than college, in which marriage is not the norm before child-rearing, in which homes are often unstable, in which long-range planning is absurd, in which the social skills you need to achieve are not even passed down.
 In his State of the Union address, President Bush is no doubt going to talk about his vision of an ownership society. But homeownership or pension ownership is only part of a larger story. The larger story is the one Lincoln defined over a century ago, the idea that this nation should provide an open field and a fair chance so that all can compete in the race of life. 
 Today that's again under threat, but this time from barriers that are different than the ones defined by socialists in the industrial age. Now, the upper class doesn't so much oppress the lower class. It just outperforms it generation after generation. Now the crucial inequality is not only finance capital, it's social capital. Now it is silly to make a distinction between economic policy and social policy. 
 We can spend all we want on schools. But if families are disrupted, if the social environment is dysfunctional, bigger budgets won't help. 
 President Bush spoke grandly and about foreign policy last Thursday, borrowing from Lincoln. Lincoln's other great cause was social mobility. That's worth embracing too.

HEADLINE: Minaya's Deadline Becomes Never Mind

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
WHO'S in, who's not? Who's cold, who's hot? If it's the Carlos Delgado negotiations, who knows?
 Delgado is the most attractive free agent remaining on the market, and depending on the day of the week and the time of day, one, two or three teams continue to pursue him.
 The number was four before the Texas Rangers disqualified themselves Sunday. Later Sunday, the number appeared to drop to two when Delgado and his agent, David Sloane, disqualified the Mets. But the Mets leaped back in yesterday morning with a phone call to Sloane from their general manager, Omar Minaya. By yesterday afternoon, they had resumed negotiations. 
 Despite the way Sloane and Delgado reacted to the Mets' heavy-handed maneuver Sunday night, they were obviously happy to see the Mets back in. The more suitors, the more money.
 No free agent wants to negotiate with only one team, unless he is Alex Rodriguez in December 2000, and that one team is the Rangers and that one team's owner is Tom Hicks. In that event, the owner has dinner with the player, falls in love with him, instantly knows he has to have him, asks where he should sign and gives the player $100 million more than the next club is willing to pay. No other competition is necessary.
 But in any other instance, competition is good for the free agent, not to mention the agent, who has told his client of the riches awaiting him.
 Delgado, who in the past seven seasons has hit 32 to 44 homers and has driven in 99 to 145 runs, knows about riches because he has just completed a four-year, $68 million contract with Toronto. Sloane began Delgado's free agency by saying he would seek a five-year, $75 million deal, probably doubting he would get it but operating on the strategy that he had to set the bar high to get clubs thinking big numbers.
 Although neither Sloane nor the clubs have talked publicly about the offers, the numbers have not approached the asking price. Bids are believed to be in the four-year, $48 million area. 
 That is the offer the Rangers made last Friday, but 48 hours later they switched. They sensed that the Mets, at least, were prepared to match their offer and go beyond it and didn't want to get into a bidding war. But they didn't say that. Instead, they borrowed a tactic that the Mets used four years ago.
 The Mets, at that time, didn't want to compete financially for Rodriguez, so they created an excuse. Rodriguez, they said, wanted special treatment and would create a 24-and-1 situation. The Rangers were more subtle. They invoked the designated-hitter monster. 
 ''We had 24 conversations where it was clearly established that Carlos had no interest in being the D.H.,'' Sloane said of the Rangers in a telephone interview yesterday. ''And then in the 25th conversation they told me that 75 percent or more of his at-bats would be as the D.H.''
 That stance prompted Delgado to drop the Rangers from his list of potential employers, which is what Texas wanted. 
 The Mets, meanwhile, shot themselves in the foot. Like trying to rush a butterfly's emergence from its cocoon, the Mets wanted Delgado to make a decision by Sunday night.
 ''They said they had to have a decision by last night,'' Sloane said. ''I told them I would not be able to do that and asked them to reconsider. They said they would not reconsider. I said I'd talk to Carlos. I did, and he instructed me not to call them back because he felt they were backing us into a corner."
 The Mets wanted a resolution before today's start of their annual winter caravan. That seems like a flimsy reason for pushing a free agent who doesn't want to be pushed. Instead of calling the Mets, Sloane called an ESPN reporter and said the Mets were out of it. The Mets heard that and panicked. They issued a postmidnight statement saying they had not withdrawn from the competition.
 Of the teams remaining in the Delgado chase, the Mets, looking to expand their winter commitment to free agents to nearly $250 million, are the one most likely to raise the stakes. They want Delgado for the middle of their lineup. Mike Piazza has lived there for nearly seven years, but he has done little the past two seasons to merit his continued presence there. Delgado would look a lot more threatening than Piazza batting behind Carlos Beltran.
 Like Beltran, Delgado apparently would have preferred the Yankees. He waited to see if the Yankees would shed Jason Giambi because of his link to steroid use. But a few weeks ago, the Yankees decided they were not going to be able to make Giambi disappear, at least not now, and signed Tino Martinez as a backup.
 That eliminated Delgado's shortcut to the playoffs. Now he has to decide which team will more likely get him there. It won't be the Orioles. The Marlins have been in the playoffs more recently than the Mets, but the Mets seem determined to borrow from the Yankees and spend what it takes to build a contender. And the Marlins cannot play in that economic league.

HEADLINE: The Greenspan Succession

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan is expected to retire next year. The Bush administration, because of its nature, will have a hard time finding a successor.
 One Fed chairman famously described his job as being to ''take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going.'' Bond and currency markets want monetary policy in the hands of someone who will say no to politicians. When a country's central banker is suspected of having insufficient spine, the result is higher interest rates and a weaker currency. 
 Today it's even more crucial than usual that the Fed chairman have the markets' trust. The United States is running record budget and trade deficits, and the foreigners we depend on to cover those deficits are losing faith. According to yesterday's Financial Times, central banks around the world have already started shifting into euros. If Mr. Greenspan is replaced with someone who looks like a partisan hack, capital will rush to the exits, the dollar will plunge, and interest rates will soar.
 Yet President Bush, as you may have noticed, only appoints yes-men (or yes-women). This is most obvious on the national security front, but it's equally true with regard to economic policy. The current Treasury secretary has no obvious qualifications other than loyalty. The new head of the National Economic Council apparently got the job because he is a Bush classmate and fund-raiser.
 Of course, Mr. Greenspan himself has become a Bush yes-man. The chairman acted as a stern father figure, demanding fiscal rectitude, when Democrats held the White House. But he turned into an indulgent uncle when Mr. Bush took office. First, he urged Congress to cut taxes in order, he said, to prevent an excessively large budget surplus. Then, when surpluses were replaced by huge deficits, he supported a highly irresponsible second round of tax cuts. 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Greenspan retains considerable credibility with the markets. Who else can satisfy both Mr. Bush and foreign investors? 
 For a while, the presumed front-runner to succeed Mr. Greenspan was Martin Feldstein of Harvard. Mr. Feldstein, like Mr. Greenspan, has a reputation built over a long, distinguished career. Also like Mr. Greenspan, he is a former crusader for fiscal responsibility who became an apologist for budget deficits once Mr. Bush took office.
 I've known Mr. Feldstein a long time, and worked for him at Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. He used to be a deficit hawk; now, out of what may be sincere conviction but looks from the outside like an effort to demonstrate political loyalty, he endorses tax cuts in the face of large budget gaps and gigantic borrowing to privatize Social Security. 
 But it's reportedly not enough, because right-wingers have never forgiven Mr. Feldstein for his finest hour -- the time when, as a member of the Reagan administration, he spoke out against deficits. It's not just vindictiveness on their part: a man who once took a stand on principle while holding office might do so again once ensconced at the Fed.
 Glenn Hubbard of Columbia, who served in the administrations of both Bushes, is also frequently mentioned. He's a smart economist, but everything in his policy career suggests that when the party really got going, he would say: ''More punch? Yes, sir, whatever you want.''
 The last name one often hears is Ben Bernanke, currently a member of the Fed's Board of Governors. (Before going to the Fed, Mr. Bernanke was chairman of the Princeton economics department, where I'm on the faculty.) If Mr. Bernanke were appointed directly from his current Fed position to the chairmanship, there would be general acclaim. But he may soon move to the Council of Economic Advisers. Why?
 Surely it's not because this administration, with its disdain for technical expertise in all fields, wants his advice. I hope I'm wrong, but my guess is that what's intended for Mr. Bernanke is a form of hazing: he will be expected to prove his loyalty by defending the indefensible and saying things he knows aren't true.
 That might seem a tolerable price to pay for the Fed chairmanship -- but a year of it might well make Mr. Bernanke damaged goods from the point of view of the markets. 
 It's a dilemma. I don't have any sympathy for the administration's perplexity. But I do wish Mr. Bernanke the best of luck, and hope he knows what he's doing.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Slide Adding to Tensions U.S. Faces Abroad

BYLINE: This article was reported by David E. Sanger, Mark Landler and Keith Bradsher and written by Mr. Sanger.; David Sanger reported from Washington for this article, Mark Landler from Frankfurt and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
After a first term in which terrorism and war dominated President Bush's foreign policy agenda, his allies in Europe and Asia suspect that his next confrontation with the world could take on a very different cast: a potential currency crisis, in which a steep plunge in the value of the dollar touches off economic waves around the world.
 Already, the tensions over the dollar are becoming a recurring source of friction, a conflict that does not reverberate as loudly as the differences over Iraq but may be as deeply felt. At a meeting in Paris on Monday, the finance ministers of Germany and France complained that Europe had unjustly borne the brunt of the dollar's decline, and called for coordinated action to stop it.
 ''Europe has until now paid too big a share in this readjustment,'' Herve Gaymard, the French finance minister, said. His German counterpart, Hans Eichel, said the United States needed to reduce its deficits, adding ''each one has to play its role.'' 
 Two months ago, similar sentiments came from China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, whose nation is at the center of a struggle with Washington over currency policy. He complained about the fall of the dollar, asking, ''Shouldn't the relevant authorities be doing something about this?''
 In an interview just before President Bush's inauguration, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow played down the tensions. ''We understand that deficits matter,'' he said, insisting that the tight budget Mr. Bush is expected to send to Congress next month should give foreigners and the financial markets the solace they seek.
 But should the dollar continue to fall -- if, for example, global investors determined that Mr. Bush did not have the will to hold spending down -- it would not only add to tensions, analysts said. It might also force up interest rates at home to keep foreigners interested in financing America's need to borrow more than $600 billion a year to cover its gap in the current account. The current account is the broadest measure of the trade and financial flows into and out of the country.
 To be sure, the dollar's fall may never reach crisis levels, and in the last few weeks, after a more or less steady fall of almost 35 percent against the euro and 24 percent against the Japanese yen over the last three years, the dollar has stabilized a bit. Many experts argue that a further decline, if relatively modest and gradual, is entirely manageable.
 Administration officials, along with a number of like-minded economists, contend that the nation's record trade and current account deficits are not particularly worrisome, a reflection more of strong foreign interest in investing in the American economy than any sign of global weakness.
 But across Asia and Europe, a wide range of officials and analysts worry that Mr. Bush's economic team may not be up to the challenge of grappling with the issue. They contend that Washington has retreated from efforts to marshal the biggest economies of the world into a mutual effort at more robust and balanced growth.
 Many European politicians and exporters cannot shake the suspicion that the Bush administration, despite its statements supporting a strong currency, has been perfectly happy to watch from the sidelines while the dollar heads down.
 At a moment of surging American trade deficits that have reached a record share of economic output, a falling dollar makes American exports more competitive and puts imports from Europe at a particular disadvantage.
 ''It's hard to tell an entrepreneur to wait two years for a policy to change when he says, 'I've got to deliver my goods tomorrow,''' said Anton Boerner, the president of BGA, the Berlin-based association of wholesalers and exporters.
 Mr. Snow, for his part, paints a vastly different picture of the international economic landscape. He described the situation as one of America's remaining the economic envy of the world, with the yawning deficits being addressed and little risk that foreigners will rethink the wisdom of lending the United States hundreds of billions of dollars a year to finance the trade gap and to cover the vast borrowing needs of the federal government.
 Mr. Snow suggested some in Europe are seeking a convenient scapegoat, particularly after the tensions over Iraq, to blame for the Continent's own inability to generate stronger growth.
 ''The current deficit levels are too large,'' Mr. Snow said, describing himself as a deficit hawk who sees a chance to cut spending because the American economy is growing again. ''They have to come down, and they will come down.''
 But deficits aside, he argued, ''overwhelmingly the United States is looked at as the model for success.'' After years of stagnation in money flowing into the government, ''revenues look good,'' and the turning point will come in a couple of weeks, he said, when Mr. Bush sends a budget to Congress in which ''you will see a number of programs that not only don't grow at the rate of inflation, but that decline.''
 While the budget is a domestic document, assessments of whether it will realistically grapple with the underlying problems and whether Mr. Bush has the political will to push tough measures through Congress may determine whether investors around the world stick with the American economy or head for the exits.

'At a Critical Juncture'
 No one knows for sure if the doubts that have already contributed to the dollar's decline will intensify. Some worry that the markets may conclude that Mr. Bush will put the financing of the Iraq war, military transformation and the costs of revamping Social Security ahead of deficit reduction. 
 Others fret about the risk that a large, highly leveraged hedge fund or a big bank could be caught betting the wrong way in the markets, touching off a sudden currency sell-off that could have implications for the rest of Mr. Bush's term.
 ''We're at a critical juncture,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, and a persistent critic of how Mr. Bush's team has handled its global economic role. ''The imbalances get worse and worse,'' he said, rivaling Japan's in the mid-1990's.
 ''The projection is that they keep rising,'' he added, noting that the current account deficit is running over 6 percent of the gross domestic product. ''And it is a trajectory that is bound to crack: people will stop buying dollars, and domestic politics will make the soaring trade deficit with China just unsustainable.''
 For all those fears, foreign investors are still buying American. While much of that lending last year came from central banks abroad, private investors have shown renewed confidence lately. In November, the last month for which there are reliable numbers, foreigners made net purchases of $81 billion, enough to easily pay for the amount by which American imports exceeded exports.
 ''Our growth rates are still higher, over the long term, than Europe's and Japan's,'' said Daniel J. Ikenson, a trade policy analyst at the Cato Institute. Given that, for foreign investors, ''there is no reason to think they will sell.''
 But the argument around the world is as much about leadership as about the long-term strength of the economy. Unlike the debate over war in Iraq, in this case the complaint is not about American unilateralism, but American retreat.
 To America's allies, the era in which the world's largest economy also seeks to be the world's economic leader has simply halted. Under both James A. Baker III, a Republican, and Robert E. Rubin, a Democrat, the Treasury Department was viewed as one of Washington's most powerful institutions. It flexed its muscles to trim the market's extremes and stem crises, from an excessively strong dollar in the 1980's to the currency collapses of the 1990's that stretched from Latin America to Asia to Russia.
 There has not been an economic crisis of significant magnitude since Mr. Bush came to office. John B. Taylor, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said that was partly a result of preventive maintenance. ''My first days on the job we had a crisis in Turkey and one coming in Argentina and Brazil,'' he said. ''Both were contained.''
 Today the Treasury is regarded as a vastly diminished institution, with comparatively little influence in the White House. Mr. Bush is seen, rightly or wrongly, as far less comfortable dealing with global economic management than he is sitting in the Situation Room, buried in the details of the Iraqi insurgency or Iran's nuclear threat. 
 As a result, the weakening dollar, to the minds of many from Hong Kong to Berlin, is a metaphor for a presidency so distracted by national security issues that American economic influence has ebbed.

China Stands Its Ground
 Washington's lack of success so far in pressuring China to finally allow its currency to float, or at least appreciate significantly to reflect its vastly stronger economy, is cited as the most striking evidence of Washington's diminished economic influence. Beijing has used other issues, chiefly the Bush administration's dependence on China to help prevent North Korea's development of nuclear weapons from touching off a wider conflagration, to keep currency demands on the back burner. 
 That has contributed to a Chinese export surge that has soared to levels almost no one predicted when the United States, Europe and China reached agreement on the accord that brought Beijing into the World Trade Organization at the end of the Clinton administration.
 The Chinese, like the Japanese in their heyday, have begun to question American economic policy. American officials say that the Chinese could solve a lot of problems by not linking their currency to the dollar, a step toward solving a trade surplus that looks set to hit a record of nearly $200 billion for 2004. It is a subject of enormous sensitivity in Beijing, because of its effect on the breakneck pace of China's economic growth. 
 But Mr. Taylor notes that teams of officials have visited China to offer advice about how to manage a floating currency and the Chinese last year hired the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to help it develop a market in currency futures.
 ''You don't do that,'' Mr. Snow said, ''if you are planning to keep the currency pegged to the dollar.''

Seeking U.S. Leadership
 China is only one piece of the global economic puzzle. The lack of interest by Mr. Bush and Mr. Snow to put together a global accord on currency, akin to the Plaza Accord that Mr. Baker organized in 1985, is viewed as evidence that Washington is content with a downward drift of the dollar. And there is no one to replace the American role.
 ''It will be a world of chaos without a center,'' said Hideo Kumano, a senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. Japan itself, after a decade of downward spiral that seems to be ending, has lost all pretense of assuming the mantle of leadership. Bush administration officials have a deep skepticism bordering on an outright ideological objection to intervening in the markets. 
 Certainly China, while growing in leaps and bounds, has neither the capacity nor the interest. ''China has a big population and big economic growth, but it is not a mature economic system yet,'' Mr. Kumano noted. ''I cannot imagine it replacing Europe or Japan in terms of influence in the world economy. In such a condition, everyone must cope with a world economy where you cannot rely on America.''
 For all the worries abroad, the Bush administration sees few signs of stress. ''You don't have any major economy now in recession, and volatility is low,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''Even inflation is contained in the emerging markets.''
 But the lesson of the 1990's is that currency crises, like the terror strikes of more recent years, are nearly impossible to predict.
 ''Financing of the U.S. current account deficit has gone more smoothly than many economists were predicting just a few years ago,'' wrote Roger M. Kubarych, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research group. ''But that does not mean that market stability can be taken for granted forever.''

HEADLINE: Backers of Gay Marriage Ban Use Social Security as Cudgel

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
A coalition of major conservative Christian groups is threatening to withhold support for President Bush's plans to remake Social Security unless Mr. Bush vigorously champions a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. 
 The move came as Senate Republicans vowed on Monday to reintroduce the proposed amendment, which failed in the Senate last year by a substantial margin. Party leaders, who left it off their list of priorities for the legislative year, said they had no immediate plans to bring it to the floor because they still lacked the votes for passage. 
 But the coalition that wrote the letter, known as the Arlington Group, is increasingly impatient.
 In a confidential letter to Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, the group said it was disappointed with the White House's decision to put Social Security and other economic issues ahead of its paramount interest: opposition to same-sex marriage.
 The letter, dated Jan. 18, pointed out that many social conservatives who voted for Mr. Bush because of his stance on social issues lack equivalent enthusiasm for changing the retirement system or other tax issues. And to pass to pass any sweeping changes, members of the group argue, Mr. Bush will need the support of every element of his coalition.
 ''We couldn't help but notice the contrast between how the president is approaching the difficult issue of Social Security privatization where the public is deeply divided and the marriage issue where public opinion is overwhelmingly on his side,'' the letter said. ''Is he prepared to spend significant political capital on privatization but reluctant to devote the same energy to preserving traditional marriage? If so it would create outrage with countless voters who stood with him just a few weeks ago, including an unprecedented number of African-Americans, Latinos and Catholics who broke with tradition and supported the president solely because of this issue.''
 The letter continued, ''When the administration adopts a defeatist attitude on an issue that is at the top of our agenda, it becomes impossible for us to unite our movement on an issue such as Social Security privatization where there are already deep misgivings.'' 
 The letter also expressed alarm at recent comments President Bush made to The Washington Post, including his statement that ''nothing will happen'' on the marriage amendment for now because many senators did not see the need for it.
 ''We trust that you can imagine our deep disappointment at the defeatist position President Bush demonstrated'' in the interview, the group wrote. ''He even declined to answer a simple question about whether he would use his bully pulpit to overcome this Senate foot-dragging.'' 
 The letter also noted that in an interview before the election Mr. Bush ''appeared to endorse civil unions'' for same-sex couples. 
 The group asked Mr. Rove to designate ''a top level'' official to coordinate opposition to same-sex marriage, as a show of commitment.
 Trent Duffy, a spokesman for the White House, said on Monday that ''the president was simply talking about a situation that exists in the Senate, not about his personal commitment or his willingness to continue to push this issue.'' Mr. Duffy said the ''president remains very committed to a marriage amendment'' and added, ''We always welcome suggestions from our friends.'' 
 Some Senate Republican leaders were not optimistic on Monday about the amendment's prospects this year. 
 ''I think if we had the vote right now we'd come up short,'' said Senator Rick Santorum, the Pennsylvania Republican who is a member of the leadership and one of the amendment's most vocal backers in Congress. ''We'd like to bring it up when we have the best possible chance of getting it passed.''
 The members of the coalition that wrote the letter are some of Mr. Bush's most influential conservative Christian supporters, and include Dr. James C. Dobson of Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, the Southern Baptist Convention, the American Family Association, Jerry Falwell and Paul Weyrich. 
 Several members of the group said that not long ago, many of their supporters were working or middle class, members of families that felt more allegiance to the Democratic Party because of programs like Social Security before gravitating to the Republican Party as it took up more cultural conservative issues over the last 20 years.
 Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, declined to talk about the letter, but said, ''The enthusiasm to get behind his proposals is going to require that he get behind the issues that really motivated social conservative voters.''
 Asked to estimate the level of discontent with the White House among the group on a scale from one to 10, Mr. Perkins put it at 8.

HEADLINE: Verizon, Seeking New Home Base, Is Said to Be Staying in New York

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Verizon Communications, which recently put its corporate headquarters up for sale and began shopping around the country for a potential new home, has decided to remain in New York after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg began an aggressive campaign to keep the company in the city, three people with knowledge of the agreement said. 
 The company, which put its two-million-square-foot Midtown office tower on the block late last year, is continuing to look for a place -- almost certainly outside New York -- to consolidate the numerous parts of its operations peppered throughout the country. 
 And while other states have been trying to lure the company, Verizon has decided to keep its headquarters in the city, and will most likely end up in Lower Manhattan, the people with knowledge of the agreement said. 
 Although several hundred of its 20,000 city employees would move to the new location outside New York, there would be no net job loss to the city, as other jobs would be moved here, Verizon executives assured Mr. Bloomberg, who negotiated personally with Ivan Seidenberg, the company's chief executive. However, the jobs that do leave New York would almost inevitably be higher paying, white-collar jobs, these people said. Peter Thonis, a spokesman for Verizon, declined to comment last night. 
 Mr. Bloomberg is fond of saying that no major company has left New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, even though many companies have moved substantial parts of their operations to New Jersey and beyond. 
 He has also insisted that his administration would not give companies tax incentives simply to stay in the city, and maintained that position in the case of Verizon, said Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary. 
 ''Both as an entrepreneur and as mayor, he has never understood why anyone wouldn't want to be in New York City,'' Mr. Skyler said.
 Bloomberg officials pressed Verizon to take advantage of a program that offers federal tax incentives for staying in or relocating to Lower Manhattan, Mr. Skyler said. Verizon officials are considering moving its headquarters into 140 West Street, a Verizon property near Vesey Street in Lower Manhattan, said two of the people familiar with those potential plans. They spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the company was still finalizing the details and would make its own announcement soon. 
 Had Verizon left the city, it would have been a major blow to the mayor, who is basing his re-election campaign in part on the city's economic recovery after Sept. 11. The mayor was so concerned about the potential loss of Verizon, whose New York roots date back to the days of New York Telephone, that he decided to handle the final negotiations personally. 
 The mayor met with Mr. Seidenberg in late October, but in November, Senator Charles E. Schumer saw Mr. Seidenberg at a Jets game chatting with Richard J. Codey, the acting governor of New Jersey, and became alarmed, Mr. Schumer said. He called Mr. Bloomberg, who then took Mr. Seidenberg to dinner at one of his favorite Midtown restaurants on Jan. 3, where he leaned on Mr. Seidenberg to remain in the city out of a sense of civic pride. 
 During dinner, said an administration official, Mr. Bloomberg gave Mr. Seidenberg a personal presentation of a speech he gives relentlessly throughout the city, emphasizing the city's falling crime rate and other attributes, arguing that smart employees want to be in New York, and pointing to the fact that his own company, Bloomberg L.P., has moved 312 employees from New Jersey to New York and will move 140 more when its new Midtown building is complete.
 ''To have Verizon's headquarters downtown really helps the overall economic development of the city,'' Mr. Schumer said yesterday. ''I think the mayor did a good job and really turned up the heat after I called him.''
 Further, officials from the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, have written letters to Mr. Seidenberg in recent weeks, reminding him of the company's agreement to keep its headquarters in New York for a ''meaningful'' amount of time after the 1997 merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, one of Verizon's predecessors. 
 Verizon's relationship with the city and its residents can politely be described as rocky. The Bloomberg administration recently put out to bid a portion of its voice and data systems business previously owned by Verizon, worth $180 million a year. Further, the city invited residents to complete a survey documenting their cellphone service problems by carrier, which did not please Verizon executives.

 BODY:

White House Says Deficit Will Rise to $427 Billion
The White House said the federal budget deficit was expected to rise this year to $427 billion -- a figure that includes a new request from President Bush to help pay for the war in Iraq.
 The announcement means that this will be the fourth consecutive year in which the deficit has grown. As recently as last July, the administration had predicted that the deficit would fall this year to $331 billion. [Page A12.] 

The United Nations urged the major industrial countries to help the United States reduce its deficits by spurring their economies to grow faster. [C4.]

Kodak Shows Signs of Reviving
With the success of its easy-to-use digital cameras, Kodak is showing signs of making its former business model work again. [C2.]

S.E.C. May Revise Listing Rules
William H. Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the commission was considering tweaking some rules for overseas companies listed in the United States, after an outpouring of foreign criticism. Mr. Donaldson said that the S.E.C. was also considering making it easier for foreign companies to delist from exchanges in the United States. [C4.]

A Path to Pharmaceutical Wealth
The story of Stewart Rahr, one of the wealthiest people in New York, offers a glimpse into a highly lucrative but little-known corner of the pharmaceutical industry. [A1.]

An Alliance to Form Health Network
Eight of the nation's largest technology companies have agreed to embrace open, nonproprietary technology standards to help build a national health information network. [C15.]

Lower-Calorie Rum From Bacardi
Bacardi Global Brands is introducing a flavored rum that the company says has half the calories of regular rum or vodka. [C5.]

Meatpacking Conditions Criticized
A report from Human Rights Watch says that working conditions among America's meatpackers and slaughterhouses are so poor that they violate basic human rights. [A13.]

Ruling Against Catalog Company
A New York judge ruled that a catalog sales company has been making illegal short-term loans at annual interest rates of more than 700 percent. [C3.]

Stock Market Shows Gains
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.95 points, to 10,461.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 4.66 points, at 1,168.41, and the Nasdaq rose 11.25 points, to 2,019.95. [C9.]

Merrill Lynch Profits Increase 21%
After years of aggressive cost cutting, Merrill Lynch showed that it was also capable of revenue growth. The firm reported a 21 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue, buoyed by gains in all its business lines. Earnings, though, fell 2.5 percent from a year earlier, tempered by costs related to adding brokers and to other charges. [C5.]

Ford Motor said operating earnings would fall by as much as 16 percent this year. [C4.]

Suit Filed Against Venture Firms
A lawsuit says that partners at two prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firms cheated founders of a start-up company out of tens of millions of dollars. [C15.]

HEADLINE: A Makeover For Trash: Now, It's Art

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
The air-kissers with the interesting eyewear were all there. It was the art opening of the season, and the cognoscenti gathered to sip chardonnay and wax poetic about the work on display at one of the city's most prestigious galleries: the dump.
 ''It's very textural, very architectonic,'' said Hector Dio Mendoza, a sculptor from San Jose, speaking of his 15-foot plastic foam tree, a work of haunting, austere beauty representative of what might be called the Trash Can School. ''I love the way light reflects off the Styrofoam.'' 
 Mr. Mendoza holds one of the most coveted positions in the San Francisco art world: one of three current artists in residence at the San Francisco Solid Waste Transfer and Recycling Center, a fragrant 44-acre font of inspiration otherwise known as the dump. About 500 gallery-hoppers attended the most recent opening, last Friday night, venturing about eight miles south of downtown to a service road lined by seagulls in Hitchcockian thousands. 
 The open studio was the seasonal highlight of a program that gives a rotating roster of jury-selected artists access to the city's garbage. 
 Founded in 1990 by a local artist and administered by Norcal Waste Systems, the company that picks up and recycles San Francisco's garbage, the program has become a bona fide phenomenon here. It is deeply expressive of a place where recycling is practically a religion and personal expression and environmental politics are urban dogma.
 Artists like Mr. Mendoza set up shop in a studio at the dump (items that cannot be recycled wind up at a landfill east of the city). Decked out in fashionable steel-toed boots and hard hats, they comb through 75 tons a day of eclectic debris -- discarded CD boxes, dead microwave ovens and the like. The resulting artwork, like Mark Faigenbaum's ''Raymond Chandler'' -- a noirish tableau created from salvaged bullets and a 1930's circuit panel spattered with what appeared to be vintage blood -- underscores the city's status as the nation's capital of recycling. Currently, 63 percent of its garbage is recycled. 
 The promotion of garbage as a ''visual resource'' is meant to inspire the public to be less wasteful and to help the city achieve a recycling goal of 75 percent by 2010. 
 ''A lot about San Francisco is outside the box, including dealing with garbage in a thoughtful way,'' said Kate Krebs, executive director of the National Recycling Coalition, a nonprofit organization in Washington. 
 Norcal Waste Systems has also pioneered an ambitious compost program in which vineyards in Napa and Sonoma Counties nourish their soil with four-star leftovers from the city's restaurants. 
 In the unbiodegradable, art endures. At the opening, Flash Hopkins, a local artist, surveyed Mr. Mendoza's ''Artificial Nature,'' an assemblage of packing peanuts configured to resemble coral. Mr. Hopkins worked with Dana Albany, a previous artist in residence, on a sailboat made of books, its sails ripped-out pages from ''The Iliad'' and ''The Odyssey.''
 ''It's amazing what people throw away,'' Mr. Hopkins said of the objects rescued from the recycling building, a cathedral of garbage where the strains of ''Moonlight Sonata,'' piped in by stereo, could be heard over the drone of Caterpillars. ''It's very powerful.''
 The artists in residence, some 50 since the program began, are financed through 2 cents of the $18.90 a month San Francisco residents pay for garbage collection. Each artist receives a $1,800 stipend, though it has been temporarily suspended because of the downturn in the city's economy. 
 The program was the brainchild of Jo Hanson, an artist and a former city arts commissioner, who began picking up trash blowing along her sidewalk in the 1970's and befriended the sanitation workers.
 ''What you see in a street full of trash,'' Ms. Hanson said, ''is that most of what's thrown away need never have existed.''
 She was convinced that art made from trash would appeal to people's emotions about waste. ''People change their ways only when their hearts are touched,'' Ms. Hanson said. 
 New York is the only other city with an artist officially designated to work with garbage. Since 1977, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, 65, has been the sole artist in residence for the city's sanitation department, working on a conceptual piece on the former Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island, from a studio in Lower Manhattan. 
 In contrast to New York, Ms. Ukeles said, San Francisco's rotating artists are selected by a jury, own their own work and are physically based at the dump. ''I was always jealous, honestly,'' she said. 
 The most poignant monument to San Francisco trash may be the sculpture garden on a hillside overlooking the dump, where paths of crushed concrete -- salvaged from the destruction of the Embarcadero Freeway -- wind through olive trees and native plants to resurrected garbage, including a dragonfly with bent propeller wings.
 The opportunity to explore the detritus of consumer culture can be profound, the artists say.
 ''It makes you think about the temporality of human existence,'' said Dee Hibbert Jones, a juror and an assistant professor of sculpture and public art at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ''You see how whole sections of lives end up in the dump.''
 Jose Tovar, a load checker at the dump, helps the artists navigate the welter of plastic trucks no longer played with, scrapbooks no longer cherished, consumer electronics tossed out for the next big thing.
 ''In Mexico, people reuse and reuse and reuse,'' said Mr. Tovar, a native of that country. ''I feel relieved when these artists reuse this stuff. Here in the U.S., we can always create more.''

HEADLINE: At Stanford, Tutoring Helps Make a Janitor Less Invisible

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
DOROTEO GARCIA worked his usual morning shift as a janitor in the art museum, set along the palm-lined promenade leading into the Stanford University campus. Hours before the doors opened and the tourists arrived, he moved nimbly in heavy work boots, well practiced in making himself unobtrusive and being ignored. 
 He passed amid the Egyptian mummy case and Zulu beadwork, the silver dragons from China and the Rodin bronzes, all those treasures, vacuuming carpets, mopping floors, dusting shelves, sponging tables, emptying garbage cans, scrubbing toilets. He earns $10.14 an hour at a university whose students pay nearly $40,000 a year in tuition, fees, and room and board. 
 Then lunch break came on this blustery January day and Mr. Garcia zipped up his jacket and headed for his English lesson. Through the arches and across the tiled arcades of the campus, this hacienda with skateboards and latte, he reached El Centro Chicano, the hub for Stanford's Hispanic students. Eric Eldon, the Stanford senior who tutored him, was waiting.
 They sat in a small conference room with posters of Cesar Chavez, the late leader of the United Farm Workers, and opened a binder of lessons. Today's was titled ''Making Requests.'' With his high rounded cheeks and hooked nose, Mr. Garcia had a profile like something from a bas-relief at Chichen Itza. Mr. Eldon, with spiky black hair, scruffy beard and very horizontal glasses, looked more like a character from a Gus Van Sant or Richard Linklater film.
 An immigrant father, age 41, and an American-born student of 23, they bent together over a list of ''polite expressions'' for a janitor to use with his boss. They lingered over the phrase ''Can I bother you?'' as Mr. Eldon explained that, yes, bothering someone is usually impolite, but in this sentence meant something more like, ''Is it O.K. if I ask you?'' They went through dialogues of a Stanford faculty or staff member requesting a janitor's help. 
 Before the lunch break ended, Mr. Garcia was on the final page of the lesson, developing a more sophisticated kind of request -- a letter to the governor of California on the issue of allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver's license. Hardly anyone around Stanford beside Mr. Eldon knew it, but Mr. Garcia had grown up in Mexico reading the political novels and essays of Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. When you are a janitor in a university of affluence, a university of soft hands, there are a lot of things people don't know about you.
 Bridging that divide was one of the major reasons for creating the tutoring program at Stanford and several other campuses in the Bay Area. Jointly operated by student volunteers, janitorial contractors and Local 1877 of the Service Employees International Union, the project brings together as many as 55 pairs of janitors and students at Stanford.
 For the union and its members, 85 percent of them immigrants from Mexico and Central America, the English classes meet both immediate and long-range goals. Learning even the rudiments of English can save a janitor from being fired for not responding to a request he does not understand. With some fluency, a janitor can get off the night shift and onto days. A rank-and-file janitor can try to become a shop steward. An immigrant can try to pass the citizenship test.
 For the Stanford students, meanwhile, the tutoring provides a sense of purpose and human connection that cannot be taught. Many of these undergraduates won admission partly by doing ''community service'' for the most cynical of reasons, to build their resumes. Their courses here resound with the armchair radicalism of Orientalism, neocolonialism, deconstructionism, white studies, critical race theory, queer theory, blah blah blah.
 ''There's a lot of privilege in this place and a lot of ignorance about that privilege,'' Mr. Eldon said. ''People are used to having maids and servants. If they trash their dorm, they're used to having someone else clean it up.'' He continued, ''You can take classes on all sorts of highfalutin political theories and trends. But to me, none of them teaches as much as being connected to people outside of Stanford.''
 Fittingly, then, the tutoring program arose from an alliance between Local 1877 and Stanford students as the union was engaged in several bitter rounds of contract negotiations in 2000. One outcome of the union's organizing efforts statewide, meanwhile, was the establishment of an educational trust fund, with employers contributing one cent for each hour worked by each janitor. Local 1877 put its share of the fund toward the tutoring system, both at colleges and high-tech companies (where paid teachers lead the literacy classes). Most of the project's current budget of $500,000 a year, though, comes from state aid.
 IN the three years that Mr. Eldon has known Mr. Garcia, three years of barbecues and soccer games as well as English lessons, the student has crossed the actual and metaphorical divide between Palo Alto and its hardscrabble neighbor, East Palo Alto. There, beyond 101 freeway, Mr. Garcia splits a one-room apartment with his son Ernesto, a Stanford janitor and community-college student. His wife and younger son remain in Oaxaca. Mr. Garcia keeps his snapshots of them on the wall, and he keeps a native Mexican cactus outside the front door.
 Sometimes, in sentimental moments, Mr. Garcia writes poetry about the people and place he left nine years ago. At a distance, it is easy to remember the good parts, not the failed economy that sent him from high school into the farm fields, from the depleted fields into town to sell tools, and from town to El Norte.
 After nearly four years of tutoring, Mr. Garcia has become at least a bit less invisible. He has spoken to incoming freshmen as part of orientation. He wrote an op-ed column for the student newspaper. And he has even written a poem about his time on the night shift that is now part of the curriculum for his fellow janitors. It reads in part:
 He doesn't carry books or binders
 He uses a mop and feather duster
 Instead of a computer
 he works with a vacuum
 He keeps the university clean
 while everyone else sleeps
 But now at one in the morning
 a janitor dreams while awake
 hoping for a better future
 for his kids.

HEADLINE: Ford Says '05 Earnings Will Fall, but It Still Expects to Make Money Making Cars

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday that it expected operating earnings to fall as much as 14 percent this year as record profits at its lending division are weighed down by rising interest rates. Ford also expects a weak first quarter that will be far short of Wall Street's expectations. 
 But executives are forecasting sharply higher profits for the core business of manufacturing and selling cars and trucks. And they said they still expected pretax profit of $7 billion in 2006, the central goal of a turnaround plan put in place after steep losses and a management shakeup in 2001. 
 ''We've had a lot of things go up and down in those years but we are remarkably on track when you look at the overall numbers,'' the chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., who took over as chief executive in late 2001, said during a meeting Tuesday with financial analysts in New York.
 To achieve its goal, Ford is banking on sharply higher profit in its core business, even though its automotive operations have been barely able to stay in the black in the last couple of years. On Tuesday, Ford said pretax operating income for its automotive operations this year would be $1.5 billion to $2 billion, up from $850 million last year. 
 Ford executives say much of the improvement will come from their Premier Automotive Group -- a suite of European-based luxury brands including Volvo, Land Rover, Jaguar and Aston Martin. Jaguar has been a particularly troublesome division for P.A.G., as the luxury group is known. 
 In a worldwide market glutted with millions more cars than there are buyers, financial analysts see Ford's projections as ambitious. At the same time, Ford will have to make more money in its automotive unit if it expects to reach its goals.
 Ford Credit, the company's financing division and a crucial profit engine, is expecting earnings to fall at least 25 percent this year as interest rates rise and the division scales back some businesses. For both Ford and General Motors, lending money to car buyers has been more lucrative than selling the cars. 
 ''We believe this improvement in automotive earnings is crucial to the company's ongoing turnaround,'' said John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, in a note to investors Tuesday. ''However, significant improvement from the P.A.G. will be difficult to achieve given that troubled Jaguar has been a persistent money loser.'' 
 Ford was more optimistic than G.M. was in its 2005 forecast earlier this month -- G.M. is projecting a steeper decline in earnings this year and pushed back its mid-decade goals.
 Ford executives said Tuesday that they expect pretax operating profit of $5 billion to $5.7 billion this year, compared with $5.8 billion last year. That projection was in line with what analysts had been expecting. 
 Ford shares rose 16 cents, or 1.22 percent, to $13.23.
 Ford and G.M., the last two predominantly American-owned automakers, have been struggling to compete against Asian and European rivals. Both have been losing market share despite heavy spending on rebates, and both are weighed down by soaring health care and pension costs. Standard & Poor's has the debt of Ford and G.M. rated one notch above junk bonds, a precarious position for two of the largest corporate borrowers. 
 Last week, Ford said its net earnings for last year, after tax and special items, was $3.49 billion, up substantially from its performance in recent years but still modest by the standards of competitors like Toyota. 
 Mr. Ford has sought to focus the company on trying to make compelling cars and trucks and selling or leaving ancillary businesses. In the United States, the company has been augmenting the offerings from its three longtime brands -- Ford, Mercury and Lincoln. This year, it will offer three Ford, Mercury and Lincoln midsize sedans, entering a market dominated by Honda and Toyota.

HEADLINE: Queens Museum Is to Redesign a Redesign

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
It is easy to see why the original design for a renovated Queens Museum of Art in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park initially captured the imagination. The building would have been draped in glass that could change from clear to opaque, framing the museum's signature exhibition, a vast architectural model of New York City. The design, by the Los Angeles architect Eric Owen Moss, was chosen from among nearly 200 entries in a competition judged by prominent architects.
 Now, three years after it was selected, Mr. Moss's design has become a piece of architectural history. The city-owned museum, together with the New York Department of Design and Construction and the Department of Cultural Affairs, has decided to abandon it and begin again with a new architect.
 A change in architects may not seem earthshaking. But the Queens Museum's about-face suggests how a much-heralded public architecture project can be derailed by economics, politics, personalities and competing visions of how an institution operates day to day. 
 ''I think the whole story is kind of sad,'' said Ralph Lerner, a former dean of Princeton University's architecture school, who was an adviser for the architectural competition. ''There was tremendous optimism, and the city really threw their support behind it. We had a top-notch jury, great competitors.'' 
 In August 2001, architects from all over the country were invited to submit their ideas for doubling the museum's size, to about 100,000 square feet, from 45,000. Conceptually, it was no easy challenge: the building was designed by Aymar Embury II, better known for country houses, as an Art Deco-ish pavilion for the 1939 World's Fair; it is the only building remaining from that event. For the World's Fair in 1964, Robert Moses had the 9,335-square-foot city panorama installed. The museum's site in the park is where the United Nations General Assembly made its first home, before moving to Manhattan in 1952.
 The museum itself opened its doors in 1972 to provide a cultural center for Queens. In addition to the panorama, it is home to permanent exhibitions about the two World's Fairs, as well as ''Tiffany by Design: Selections from the Neustadt Museum Collection.'' In the middle of the building there is still an ice hockey rink that is to be removed and relocated by the Parks Department. Except for a three-year, $15 million upgrade of parts of the museum by Rafael Vinoly in 1994, the building has been largely untouched. 
 Yet the site has clear potential. One length of the building faces the wide-open, verdant setting of the park, near the striking, albeit decrepit, World's Fair Unisphere. Grand Central Parkway rolls by on the other. Shea Stadium and the Arthur Ashe tennis stadium nearby offer a crop of potential visitors, though few currently drop in.
 And the building is obviously in need of rejuvenation. The stone facade hard by the parkway is forbidding and outdated. Letters are missing from the sign -- the E in Museum, for example. Inside, the ''cafe'' consists of four vending machines and a few metal tables; the guard sells packaged sushi and sandwiches at the front desk on weekends. And there is no grand entrance to signal that visitors have arrived. 
 ''You always feel like you're coming in the side door,'' said Tom Finkelpearl, the museum's executive director. ''People who are in the park don't realize we're open.''
 Mr. Moss, an architect based in Culver City, Calif., who has an eclectic portfolio of private and public buildings, including several recent commissions in Los Angeles, was intrigued by the Queens project. ''It would have a kind of civic importance both to the Grand Central Parkway and the park,'' he said. 
 ''I was excited,'' he added. ''My family is from New York.''
 Mr. Moss titled his winning design, selected in December 2001, ''Recollecting Forward,'' meaning that the project acknowledged the history of the existing building while imagining a very different future for it and the park. 
 His design had four overarching concepts: ''the main event,'' which called for the removal of the central part of the existing building and its conversion into a large exhibition space with a theater and presentation area; the ''magic mountain,'' in which the excavated earth would be piled along the parkway's edge, forming an acoustic barrier and framing a sculpture garden; the ''highway,'' a path connecting the museum with the nearby Queens Zoo, Shea Stadium and the tennis stadium; and the ''drape,'' a bent-glass roof and wall enclosing the main exhibition space.
 Anne Papageorge, then acting commissioner of the Department of Design and Construction and a juror, said of the design just after the competition, ''This scheme created what's frankly a magnificent event in the center of the existing facade.''
 The plan that the museum ultimately approved reduced the scale of the central area, retained the path to other Queens attractions, eliminated the mountain and replaced the glass drape with two long skylights. Mr. Moss said he was not happy with the changes but accepted them. ''It was my sense that the visionary conviction of the project originally enunciated in the brief was sustained,'' he said. ''We all went forward -- and I thought, positively and optimistically -- with the scheme and an approved budget.''
 The glass drape that Mr. Moss initially designed would have cost about $40 million, he and others involved said. But the available budget was only about $27 million, which the Cultural Affairs Department is to underwrite. 
 But as Mr. Moss continued work on the project, things began to shift around him. The cast of top decision-makers changed: Mr. Finkelpearl, formerly deputy director of P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, took over as director in 2002, replacing Laurene Buckley and her interim successor, Carma Fauntleroy; Alan Suna, the chief executive of Silvercup Studios, became the president of the board; and David J. Burney became the commissioner of the city's Design and Construction Department.
 ''Early in the fall of 2004, the museum director began to raise concerns that suggested the surprise arrival of an entirely different set of priorities,'' Mr. Moss said. ''Should we move the bookstore? The restaurant? Should we relocate the classrooms?''
 ''These questions were answerable -- or had already been answered,'' he continued. ''And they were relatively small issues in the budget context, and in practical terms, readily solvable.''
 Mr. Suna said this was an oversimplification. Having been largely excluded from the selection process the first time around, he said, the board wanted a say in the final design. And when it came to reconciling its requirements with Mr. Moss's vision, the two did not see eye to eye. ''Eric was the winner of a competition -- a competition which did not have really any bounds,'' Mr. Suna said. ''As we got down to the workings of it, it was all different.''
 ''Not enough time was spent on designing the parkway side of the building,'' he said. ''Nor was there sufficient detail on how the actual museum worked, all the parts and pieces.''
 Mr. Finkelpearl, the museum director, said of the design, ''There was a general overarching feeling that it wasn't doing the trick.'' 
 So in November, the museum's board and city representatives met and decided to end the relationship with Mr. Moss. ''We looked at each other and said, 'This is just not working -- it's not meeting the basic programmatic needs, and we have to go in a different direction,''' Mr. Finkelpearl recalled. 
 Mr. Moss said he was taken aback. ''The scheme had been agreed upon by everyone, the budget was signed off on, we had started to work on the next phase,'' he said. 
 Mr. Burney of the city's Department of Design and Construction suggested that the creative aspect of the original competition collided with the less glamorous reality of getting something built. ''For cultural institutions that are on limited funds,'' he said, ''there is a terrific conflict between creating an iconic building that is a fund raiser -- that is an advertisement for a building, that puts it on the map -- and a building that meets back-office needs, exhibition space,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Moss maintained that it was more a matter of a changing of the guard. ''I think the truth of the matter is that the new people involved wanted a different building,'' he said.
 ''My guess is, they'll simplify what we did -- improve the interior in a prosaic, pragmatic, piecemeal way,'' he added.
 There will be no competition for Mr. Moss's successor; an architect will be chosen by the museum and the city from a preapproved list of eight architects compiled by the Department of Design and Construction for projects of $5 million or more. They are Fox & Fowle Architects, a finalist the first time; Mr. Vinoly; Polshek Partnership Architects; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; Arquitectonica; 1100 Architects; the team of Ammann & Whitney and Grimshaw Architects; and Gluckman Mayner Architects. Mr. Burney said he expected to name an architect within six weeks and to start work on the museum by midyear. 
 ''Eric is a very good designer,'' Mr. Burney said. ''Sometimes you get to a point where it's just appropriate to make a switch.''

HEADLINE: Edison Hopes to Transform Old Factory Sites, Smartly

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
Like a number of other suburban towns in the New York area during the boom years after World War II, Edison, N.J., was a magnet for manufacturers looking for vast tracts of land that usually could not be found in older industrial areas like Elizabeth and Rahway. 
 Fifty years later, however, many of the large manufacturing companies that flocked to Edison have left. Local real estate executives say the township, one of the largest in New Jersey and the site of large business parks like Raritan Center and Heller Industrial Park, has done an admirable job attracting other commercial tenants, primarily in retailing and distribution but also in the office sector. 
 Still, in the last few years, Edison has had to contend with some very large sites that have come to market, like a 50-acre site along Route 27 that once was a Frigidaire air-conditioner factory and the 102-acre site on Route 1 that once was a large Ford assembly plant. 
 At the same time, the town has finally begun to address the sprawl of strip malls that has left Edison with no true civic or commercial center. 
 Local officials say that Edison, which sits in the center of a swarming regional highway system, is one of the five fastest-growing centers for suburban-based employment in New Jersey. The township has about 100,000 residents and its daytime population is estimated at 300,000. 
 And local officials say that the town, which no longer is considered a bedroom community, now needs amenities like a performing arts hall, as well as a stronger destination-oriented retail district.
 Like a 32-square-mile doughnut, Edison surrounds the borough of Metuchen, but only Metuchen has a downtown district. 
 Lately the old Ford factory site, because of its size and prominent location, has attracted interest as both a civic and a commercial heart for Edison. 
 Most of the buildings there were recently demolished, and though Ford still needs to finish its environmental cleanup, the site now sits almost eerily empty at the intersection of Route 1 and Vineyard Road, surrounded by big-box retailers, auto dealerships and single-family homes. 
 Hartz Mountain Industries, the developer based in Secaucus that is under contract to buy the old Ford site, says it is still working on a site plan.
 For now, the goal is to build a large pedestrian-friendly ''lifestyle center'' that would combine a few office buildings and hotels with a larger number of stores as well as cultural facilities, a movie multiplex and entertainment sites, like comedy clubs. 
 Hartz is an experienced developer of mixed-used properties, but in Edison, the company is proceeding cautiously because many residents have raised concerns about overdevelopment.
 In August, the company set up a Web site to generate public feedback on the site, and it has since followed up with town-hall-style meetings. Because the old Ford site is large and is within a densely populated area, ''everyone has to get this right,'' said Emanuel Stern, the company's president and chief operating officer. 
 Town officials, meanwhile, envision the old Ford site as a destination point for the community. They say that because Edison's schools are now operating at capacity, they would prefer no new housing there, other than what might cater to either seniors or to young professionals.
 But they also say they hope the site will fit in with Edison's master plan, which was released in August 2003. It hopes to foster smart-growth initiatives, where developers combine commercial, cultural and residential buildings with open land, so that local residents may work, shop and play in the same area. 
 George A. Spadoro, Edison's mayor, said his town was looking to create a ''world-class project'' at the old Ford site, and some local real estate executives predicted that Hartz would not have trouble finding retail tenants because of the site's size. 
 Joseph J. Sarno, a senior director of brokerage services for the Metropark office at Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey, said of the developers: ''They're going to get their pick of the litter. There seems to be an insatiable appetite for retail, as well as a flight to newness, in this area, as well as throughout New Jersey.'' 
 Still, Edison officials have not ruled out the possibility of instead creating a town center on a site along Route 27 that used to be a Revlon plant; it has been mostly vacant since the early 1990's. 
 In February 2004, Starwood Heller, the owner, presented town officials with a plan to use 45 acres of the site for a development of 600 apartments -- 300 of them for seniors -- as well as about 45,000 square feet of retail space. Edison officials, however, quickly dismissed the plan.
 They said it did not fit the concept of smart growth and was nothing more than an effort to build a 1970's-style housing development with a dressed-up strip mall. The site is now being marketed for sale. 
 For now, Edison officials are pursuing their smart-growth goals elsewhere. One current goal is to create a seaport village along the Raritan River that would combine commercial and residential elements as well as a boardwalk, a marina and a science center.
 In addition, Edison hopes to acquire 11 acres off Whitman Road for park, recreational or community use. Roughly half of that land was once used by the Chemical Insecticide Corporation, and it is now an environmental Superfund cleanup site.
 As part of its smart-growth efforts, Edison, since 1994, has acquired 500 acres of land for either recreational or open-space use. Mayor Spadoro, nonetheless, predicted that it would take both time and effort before Edison reached a consensus on development. 
 ''Smart growth is a lot easier to implement in an area where you have open land,'' said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''When you have a fully developed municipality like Edison, it becomes harder to envision.''

HEADLINE: In Birmingham, Richard Scrushy Is a Local Story

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON; Glynn Wilson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Jan. 25 

 BODY:
The trial of Richard M. Scrushy, one of this city's most prominent and charismatic executives, got under way today, with the chief federal prosecutor calling Mr. Scrushy the mastermind of a sweeping accounting fraud at the hospital chain he founded. ''He was the boss -- he was the man,'' the prosecutor said.
 Alice H. Martin, the United States attorney in charge of the case, promised the jurors that she would bring them ''inside HealthSouth'' to the executive offices where the decisions to manipulate the hospital company's results took place. Ms. Martin said all five former chief financial officers would testify. ''You will hear how Richard Scrushy directed them to inflate that profit,'' artificially boosting earnings by $2.7 billion from 1996 through 2002, she said.
 But defense lawyers countered by arguing that Mr. Scrushy was the victim of a fraud conceived by the financial officers, who, the lawyers said, misled him as much as they misled the company's outside auditors, Ernst & Young, and the company's board of directors. The executives ''did it not for Richard Scrushy,'' argued Jim Parkman, a Birmingham lawyer who is serving as Mr. Scrushy's main defender at the trial. ''They did it for themselves. 
 ''You're not going to find one single memo, document, note, e-mail -- nothing -- with Richard Scrushy's fingerprint on it,'' Mr. Parkman said.
 Instead, Mr. Parkman sought to describe William T. Owens, a former chief financial officer who is a critical government witness, as a man desperate to keep the company going. ''He needed the money,'' he said. ''He needed it more than anyone else.''
 The courtroom was crowded with lawyers, local press and the curious, and local television crews waited on the courthouse steps, eager to catch Mr. Scrushy leaving, holding hands with his wife. The trial made the local evening news, although it was not the top story.
 While the case against Mr. Scrushy, who earned and spent tens of millions of dollars as head of HealthSouth, is of national interest, the trial is, in many senses, a local one. He will be judged, if not exactly by a jury of his peers, then certainly by the Birmingham community. 
 And that seems to be a crucial element of Mr. Scrushy's defense strategy. Skeptics say he began more than a year ago to court public opinion, reminding people of his good works and his religious faith. Last year, he began attending the Guiding Light Church, a ministry that caters primarily to blacks. In March, Mr. Scrushy and his wife, Leslie, became hosts of a half-hour Christian-themed talk show each weekday morning on local television.
 The judge, Karon O. Bowdre, of United States District Court in Birmingham, has tried to curtail what she considered overt attempts to influence the jury pool outside the courtroom by forbidding lawyers to comment on the case. In addition, she closed most of the jury selection to the public. 
 The jury seated for the trial -- 12 members of the regular panel and 6 alternates -- is evenly divided between men and women; 11 of the jurors are black. 
 Aware that both the prosecution and the defense may try to introduce elements of Mr. Scrushy's character or lifestyle that go beyond the issues in the case, the judge told the jury on Tuesday, ''A trial is not a popularity contest.'' And, seemingly in response to concerns raised by the defense, Ms. Bowdre emphasized that the jurors should not be influenced one way or another by Mr. Scrushy's wealth. ''Mr. Scrushy is not on trial for making and spending money,'' she said.
 Federal prosecutors are presenting a long list of charges against Mr. Scrushy, although they announced on Tuesday that they had reduced the number of counts to 46 from 58. Along with charges of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering, he is charged with false certification of corporate finances in the first major test of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Congress's response to a wave of corporate fraud cases and its attempt to make executives more accountable for what goes on in their companies. At HealthSouth, Mr. Scrushy signed documents attesting that the financial statements given investors were accurate.
 Mr. Scrushy, who has steadfastly, even defiantly, maintained his innocence, has gone through a changing cast of lawyers. The team that will be defending him in court is now from the Birmingham area, including not only Mr. Parkman but also Donald V. Watkins, a prominent black lawyer and businessman who was sitting next to Mr. Scrushy on the opening day of the trial.
 Just a few years ago, Mr. Scrushy, and Birmingham as well, seemed to revel in his astonishing success at creating HealthSouth, a chain of rehabilitation hospitals. A former respiratory therapist, he started the company in 1984 from virtually nothing, building it into a national presence with some 2,000 hospitals and clinics that employed 50,000 people across the country. To an aging industrial city, Mr. Scrushy seemed to promise a robust future in health care and economic prosperity.
 Mr. Scrushy himself embodied what it was to be a modern chief executive, amassing tremendous personal wealth with all the trappings: luxury homes, fast cars and boats and the ability to spread his good fortune around the community. His charity was on prominent display, with the Scrushy name splashed on buildings from the local library to a junior college campus. His vision included a hospital here that would have the very latest in medical technology.
 But the hospital remains unfinished, and the new management team running HealthSouth plans to exit the venture. 
 In the wake of the fraud uncovered at HealthSouth, investors lost hundreds of millions of dollars, and the shares still do not trade on a major stock exchange. Having narrowly averted bankruptcy, HealthSouth is now struggling to straighten out its affairs. It employs 44,000 people. 
 Some in the community blame Mr. Scrushy for what has transpired since the government first disclosed the fraud nearly two years ago. ''I think there's a real strong sense he has let people down and shamed a community that was proud of HealthSouth,'' said Pamela H. Bucy, a law professor at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, who used to live in the Birmingham neighborhood where the Scrushys live. 
 But the defense lawyers sought to portray Mr. Scrushy as a great visionary, brought down by his trust in others. Mr. Scrushy had ''a dream of building something great -- not for himself, but for others,'' Mr. Parkman said.
 Much of the trial is expected to come down to the credibility of the witnesses, including the numerous former HealthSouth executives who have already admitted their part in the fraud and are cooperating with the government. Mr. Owens wore a secret recording device to tape some of his conversations with Mr. Scrushy, a tape that the jury is expected to hear during the trial. 
 But while Ms. Martin made frequent references to the coming testimony of her witnesses, the defense made clear that it would offer a vigorous attack on the significance of what was said on the tape and whether it represented clear proof of Mr. Scrushy's involvement. 
 Arguing that the tapes were ''controlled'' in a way to try to reach a certain outcome, Arthur Leach, the second defense lawyer to make opening arguments, told jurors to listen to it carefully. ''You will see it's cryptic,'' he said. ''There are no direct references.''
 And legal specialists say that defense lawyers are likely to take an extremely aggressive approach to defending their client, as a way of countering the steady stream of witnesses testifying against Mr. Scrushy. 
 ''Scrushy is going to swing for the fences every chance he gets,'' said Roland Riopelle, a former federal prosecutor who now practices at Sercarz & Riopelle in New York. 
 The stakes are high: Mr. Scrushy faces a lengthy prison term and heavy fines if he is convicted on some of the counts, and the trial has been widely viewed as an important test of the new Sarbanes-Oxley legislation because he was the first chief executive to be charged under the law. 
 Prosecutors have poured enormous energy and resources into the case. ''It is of monumental importance, not only to the United States attorney in Alabama, but also to the Department of Justice as a whole,'' said Christopher J. Bebel, a former federal prosecutor who now practices in Houston.

HEADLINE: Times Company Says Profit Fell Slightly in 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit fell slightly as gains in advertising -- particularly political ads and help-wanted listings -- were outweighed by increased costs, including the price of newsprint.
 The company reported net income of $110.2 million for the quarter ended in December, down from $110.9 million in the period a year earlier, a decline of 0.6 percent. Earnings-per-share rose during the quarter, to 75 cents from 73 cents, in part because of share repurchases. The per-share results beat analysts' expectations, as tabulated by Thomson First Call, by 4 cents. 
 Revenue for the quarter rose 2.5 percent, to $903.9 million from $882.3 million a year ago.
 For the year, the Times Company reported that net income fell 3.3 percent, to $292.6 million, on revenue that increased 2.4 percent, to $3.3 billion. In addition to The New York Times, the company owns 18 other newspapers, including The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune, and 8 network-affiliated television stations.
 Results reported by the Times Company executives provided little solace to investors seeking evidence that the company -- as well as the newspaper industry as a whole -- was about to benefit from a sustained rebound in advertising.
 The company reported that advertising revenue increased 3.2 percent in the quarter, compared with a year earlier. ''The year is off to a slow start,'' Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive, told analysts in a conference call, citing sluggish advertising in the hotel and entertainment sectors. A moment later, she added, ''Visibility remains limited.''
 The company said an increase in costs in the quarter of 4.6 percent had wiped out the gain in revenue, as the cost of newsprint rose and the company increased its spending on compensation and its marketing efforts. Circulation revenue was essentially flat.
 Among the bright spots cited yesterday by the company was a 14.3 percent increase in the advertising revenue of its broadcast operations in the fourth quarter, at least some of it a result of spending on the presidential campaign and other political races.
 At the company's print and digital holdings, retail advertising rose 8 percent in the quarter, but national advertising fell 1.4 percent. Classified advertising rose 2.9 percent. Help-wanted advertising rose 13.3 percent and real estate was up 5.8 percent, while automotive listings fell 6.8 percent.
 Regional newspapers, mostly in the Southeast and California, increased advertising revenue by 4 percent in the fourth quarter, a greater margin than in the company's New England media group, which was up 2.6 percent, or the group that includes its flagship paper, which was up 2 percent.
 The company cited strength in telecommunications, recreation and department store advertising at its regional papers. It said the groups that include The New York Times and its Web site, nytimes.com, as well as The Boston Globe and its Web site recorded strong growth in department store advertising, but those gains were offset by weakness in advertisements placed by movie studios, among other companies.
 ''At this point, the categories that have worked over the past few months continue to work,'' said John Janedis, a research analyst for Banc of America Securities, who does not personally own stock in the company but whose firm has an investment banking relationship with it. ''The problem is that the categories that have been soft are not rebounding at all.
 ''We need to see a rebound in the economy for advertising to rebound to the point the industry hopes it does this year. At this point, it's certainly not a slam dunk.''
 The company predicted that growth in its overall advertising revenue would be ''in the mid-single digits'' for the current year.
 In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of the Times Company closed at $39.95, up 45 cents.

HEADLINE: Married To the Mall

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni

 BODY:
THE upscale food court in the Time Warner Center can be derided for many reasons, but a lack of clear marking is not among them. From the moment you walk into the center, no matter which entrance you use, you encounter signs pointing the way to the preciously termed ''restaurant and bar collection'' a few stories up. 
 But during a lunchtime visit to one of the restaurants last fall I encountered a well-dressed gentleman, perhaps in his early 60's, who paced before the elevators on the ground level. In a confused voice he asked me the location of the restaurant Per Se, where he had a coveted reservation.
 ''The fourth floor,'' I said. He stared at me quizzically. I gestured to one of those signs. I repeated my answer. Finally he climbed aboard an elevator with me. But I could tell that he still had doubts. He seemed unable to believe that one of Manhattan's most ambitious new restaurants was high above the street in a corner of a shopping mall. 
 In fact four of Manhattan's most ambitious new restaurants are in this ''vertical retail environment,'' as its promoters prefer to call it. Their eagerness to euphemize underscores the boldness of their experiment: asking New York diners to consider elevators, escalators and bright indoor lighting appropriate visual preludes to extremely expensive dinners.
 Nearly a year since the center opened it is still too soon to tell whether that experiment will literally pay off. But those restaurants -- Per Se, Masa and V Steakhouse on the fourth floor and Cafe Gray on the third -- have been operating long enough for answers to other questions. How crucially is fine dining affected by an unusual physical context? What is it like to cross yards of gleaming marble and brave the glaring seductions of Samsung and Sephora on the way to and from an appointment with foie gras?
 It is usually disconcerting. It is sometimes disorienting. Alongside the restaurants on the fourth floor is a bar, the Stone Rose, whose music echoes up and down the hall, trapped under the same roof. I left Masa one night and felt my post-toro tranquility shatter under the oppressive beat and incongruous lyrics of ''Hungry Like the Wolf.'' I was irritated like the coyote.
 But an hour and then a day later I did not remember Masa less fondly or long to return less ardently. The layout and gestalt of the Time Warner Center were annoyances, but they were ignorable. The center proves that restaurants transcend their trappings, a truth that was often overlooked as culinary connoisseurs fretted about celebrated chefs like Thomas Keller and Jean-Georges Vongerichten setting up kitchens in the kind of structure that often bestrides a highway access road.
 For New Yorkers the center is a jarring development but also a positive one. Without it Mr. Keller, the head chef of Per Se, might not have set up a kitchen here at all. Because the center is a mixed-use development in which the restaurants lend cachet to the residences and office space, Mr. Keller could be offered an economic safety net, a deal that insulated him from financial failure.
 Mr. Vongerichten, the supervising chef of V Steakhouse, benefited from a similar arrangement, and the aggregate glitter of these two helped to lure Masayoshi Takayama, the chef at Masa, and Gray Kunz of Cafe Gray. The four restaurants that they guide -- plus a fifth, under the stewardship of the chef Charlie Trotter, to come sometime over the next year -- probably wouldn't exist without their atypical commercial cradle.
 Would they be more appealing at street level, with sidewalks in front and portals that admitted natural light? In most ways, yes. Their odd situations yield unsettling effects. After hours in the dimly lighted fantasy of Per Se, a diner is thrust not into moonbeams and fresh air but into the harshly illuminated, stale reality of the rest of the center. A cold slap punctuates a warm hug.
 Or sometimes the rest of the center is thrust upon a diner. One night I watched a woman and her two teenage daughters, all three dressed in white Capri pants and brightly colored T-shirts, march straight into Masa and then into Per Se, just to have a look. Understandably they treated the exclusive restaurants on the fourth floor the way they had treated stores on the lower three, as crannies of a mall that invited exploration.
 ''It's been a problem for us, to be honest,'' said Mr. Keller in a recent telephone interview. ''You don't want to upset people by saying, 'You can't come into the restaurant.' But you don't want to upset diners by having hordes of people walking around.'' He said Per Se might construct an entrance in front of its current entrance, a buffer zone of sorts.
 He conceded that the center presented more disruptions and distractions than he had expected, including the loudness of the Stone Rose and the exuberance of its patrons.
 ''That was just an oversight,'' Mr. Keller said. ''If it was just restaurants on the fourth floor, we could have more control over who was going up and down. But because of the bar you can't really restrict the flow of people.''
 The fourth floor does not have any stores. For a while it did not have much of anything beyond the restaurants, a cash machine and a lot of empty space. ''It felt like a parking garage,'' said Clark Wolf, a prominent restaurant consultant.
 When I stopped by last week it had several modern sculptures and a central cluster of roped-off couches, chairs and lamps: a living room diorama. ''All the time we're talking about ways to warm up the floor,'' said Phil Suarez, an owner of V Steakhouse. They still have a long way to go.
 And yet it does not wholly matter. For a restaurant with enough allure, diners have long endured inconveniences or gone places they might otherwise not. That was true in the past of Windows on the World; it is true today of Rao's and Peter Luger.
 Cafe Gray, on the southern end of the center's third floor, is beside a Bose store that does not exactly whet the appetite, but the long hallway beyond the restaurant's entrance serves as a decompression chamber. By the time a diner reaches his or her table, the J. Crew just a few dozen yards away is a distant memory.
 On the fourth floor Per Se and V Steakhouse offer views of Central Park that represent rewards for the punishment of their milieu. Those views make them feel more connected to Manhattan than, say, Alain Ducasse or Le Bernardin, both of which deliberately separate themselves from the streets they front by essentially walling off or sheathing their windows. Masa contrives a space so fastidiously minimalist and profoundly insulated that it banishes any awareness of the world just beyond its walls.
 The location of these restaurants is an affront less to the aesthetics of dining than the particular -- and, truth be told, provincial -- expectations and experiences of us New Yorkers. When I dined around Hong Kong last spring, more than half of the restaurants I visited, all celebrated and rapturously recommended, were atop skyscrapers or in the middle of shopping malls or office buildings.
 Patric Kuh, author of ''The Last Days of Haute Cuisine'' (Viking, 2001), made an excellent point when we spoke on the phone not long ago. He noted that so much has changed about fine dining inside New York restaurants, where servers dress and speak less formally than they once did, that what goes on outside the restaurants in the Time Warner Center is hardly revolutionary.
 Besides, he said, the proliferation of chain stores in recent years means that ''the malling of Midtown Manhattan has already happened.''
 ''The Time Warner Center,'' he added, ''simply puts it under a roof.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Report Calls for Help to Ease U.S. Budget and Trade Deficits

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
The United Nations on Tuesday urged all the major industrial countries, especially Japan and the nations of Europe, to help the United States reduce its deficits by spurring their own economies to grow faster.
 In a report, ''World Economic Situation and Prospects 2005,'' the United Nations said that the budget and trade deficits of the United States were putting the global economy off balance.
 It echoed warnings by the International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions in saying the United States cannot continue to carry its huge debts.
 ''What we really need is a major advancement in cooperation among the advanced economies to help the U.S. get out of this problem,'' said Jose Antonio Ocampo, the under secretary general for economic and social affairs at the United Nations, in an interview. 
 The United States deficit is a global problem in part because the country has the fastest-growing economy among industrial nations and, together with China, is largely responsible for helping to pull the world economy out of the doldrums. But whereas China has been an economic engine with its huge growth in manufacturing and exports, the United States has pushed growth by consuming far more goods than it exports.
 The report said that the global recovery may have reached its zenith, with the world's economy growing by 4 percent in 2004, compared with 2.8 percent in 2003. The report estimated that the global economy will grow by 3.25 percent this year.
 Over all, the developing economies, including China and India, are doing better than the industrialized nations, according to the United Nations report.
 ''We have a very peculiar mix that is almost unprecedented,'' Mr. Ocampo said. He said the mix included high commodity prices, high oil prices and a lack of major perturbances in financial markets, which routinely hurt the more vulnerable developing countries. The biggest problem facing developing nations is the money they have to give rich nations to repay old debt and the money they are spending to accumulate international reserves to protect against a future financial crisis.
 Much of those reserves are made up of United States Treasury bonds, which in turn are underwriting the United States debt.
 Despite the earlier warnings, the United States debt has deepened; its trade deficit is forecast to have reached a record $600 billion for 2004. The Bush administration has promised to reduce spending in its new budget and has called on China to revalue its currency against the dollar to make Chinese exports more expensive, which in turn would help lower the United States trade deficit.
 But the United Nations report said the problem was made more complicated by the falling dollar. A continued drop in the dollar could hurt the economies of Europe and Japan, which need to grow so they can buy more American goods and help right the trade imbalance.
 Instead, the United Nations report urges the major industrial countries to work out a solution that will help the United States reduce its deficits by spurring their own economies to grow faster, especially Japan and the countries of Europe. 
 The United States has amassed a debt without precedent. The International Monetary Fund calculates that the United States' current-account deficit stands at $631 billion, or 5.4 percent of gross domestic product.
 Japan and China both have trade surpluses, as do most of the wealthiest European nations. The exceptions are Britain, which has a current-account deficit equivalent to 2 percent of its G.D.P., and Italy, with a deficit of 1.1 percent of G.D.P.
 ''The message of our report is that the industrialized countries all have their own problems that will hurt growth,'' Mr. Ocampo said. ''The U.S. has its deficits while Europe and Japan are slow in recovering. But the most challenging is the U.S. twin deficits.''

HEADLINE: At Harvard, the Bigger Concern of the Faculty Is the President's Management Style

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER; Sam Dillon contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Among Harvard's faculty, the underlying conversation right now is not about gender differences and the ability of women to succeed in math and science. It is about Lawrence H. Summers's ability to succeed as president of the university.
 The uproar over Mr. Summers's remarks suggesting that innate gender differences might explain the lack of women in math and science careers comes against the backdrop of distress over his management style, which has been building since he took over three and a half years ago.
 A dozen Harvard professors, as well as other educators associated with the university, said in interviews that for all his intellectual vigor and vision, Mr. Summers, a former Harvard economics professor, has created a reservoir of ill will with what they say is a pattern of humiliating faculty members in meetings, shutting down debate and dominating discussions. This ill will, they say, has helped fuel the fury on campus over what Mr. Summers initially said were meant to be provocative, off-the-record remarks at an academic conference here on Jan. 14. 
 ''Larry is stimulating to argue with one on one and would be admirably controversial as a colleague,'' said Daniel S. Fisher, a Harvard professor of physics and applied physics, who has observed Mr. Summers in many meetings. ''But with Larry as president, the rules are clear. For the president, it is fine to be provocative, but for faculty, serious questions and constructive dissent are squelched.''
 The support of the faculty is particularly important now, as Mr. Summers pushes ahead with his ambitious plans to expand the campus across the Charles River, revise the undergraduate curriculum, make Harvard pre-eminent in big science and bring more low-income students to the university. The many admirers of Mr. Summers say his brash style makes him just the person to lead Harvard into the future. 
 Steven Pinker, a star psychology professor who left the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Harvard a year ago, called Mr. Summers a ''refreshing'' change from the ''bland diplomats'' that he said college presidents tend to be today.
 ''He does speak his mind,'' said Professor Pinker, whose work Mr. Summers is known to admire and which provided much of the foundation for the recent remarks about women. ''He subscribes to the idea that ideas should be discussed. He enjoys stating his position forcefully. He enjoys a forceful rejoinder. He doesn't believe people should wilt under the pressure of a good argument.''
 But his critics say Mr. Summers puts his ego before the university and its academic values.
 ''He just dominates faculty meetings,'' said Mary C. Waters, the chairwoman of the sociology department, ''There's no dialogue. You speak and then Larry responds.''
 Most professors who were interviewed refused to be identified, saying they were afraid of retribution from Mr. Summers. Those who did speak on the record took pains to mute their public criticism. 
 Mr. Summers spent much of last week apologizing for his remarks about women and science and declaring his intention to recruit more women as professors. 
 In an interview on Friday, Mr. Summers said his propensity to debate and challenge ''sometimes leaves people thinking I'm resistant to their ideas when I am really trying to engage with their ideas.'' Asked if he thought he needed to adjust his style, he said, ''I've learned from this experience.'' 
 Whatever anger and resentment he has stirred among the faculty, Mr. Summers appears to have the strong support of the Harvard Corporation's seven-member board, which includes him and his former mentor Robert E. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary. 
 ''I think he is an outstanding president and he has a chance to be one of Harvard's greatest presidents,'' Mr. Rubin said. He added that he was unaware of widespread faculty discontent with the management style of Mr. Summers. 
 Mr. Summers, who was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, was only a few months into the job when he got into a fight with Cornel West, a star of the Afro-American Studies department, over his scholarship, which resulted in Professor West's highly publicized departure for Princeton. (''Good morning, Mr. President, who have you insulted today?'' Mr. Clinton said to Mr. Summers in a telephone conference call after the West incident.)
 Several months later, invited to speak at a conference on globalization sponsored by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Mr. Summers stunned many professors with his brusque dismissal of their views on the subject, saying those who voiced concern about the possible downside of globalization were naive. At an early meeting with some 80 law school professors, Mr. Summers dismissed as stupid the reasoning behind a junior faculty member's suggestion about which departments might benefit by moving across the Charles River, to Allston, Mass., though he later apologized. Some professors who were present felt that Mr. Summers was dismissing the faculty member along with her suggestion. Professor Fisher and others cite many recent examples in which Mr. Summers has dismissed their views or questions, or put down their colleagues. Professor Waters said she and many other women on the faculty left a meeting with Mr. Summers in October feeling he had not understood their concerns over the sharp decline in the recruiting of tenured female faculty members. But Melissa Franklin, a physics professor who had spoken out at the meeting, said she felt encouraged afterward when Mr. Summers telephoned her to say he wanted to explore her concerns.
 Mr. Summers's reputation had preceded him to Harvard, and was even the subject of discussion on the presidential search committee. ''When Larry was being considered for president, his provocative manner and insensitivity to others was the major criticism raised by skeptics,'' said Howard Gardner, a professor of cognition at the Harvard education school and an expert on leadership.
 Supporters like Mr. Rubin ''gave assurances that he'd gotten an education in Washington, that his rough edges had been smoothed,'' Professor Gardner said. ''On the basis of what I have observed and heard from colleagues, I now believe, regrettably, that the supporters were expressing a hope rather than a reality.''
 Professor Gardner made a point of saying that in many ways he still considers Mr. Summers ''an impressive leader,'' adding, ''but I fear that his inability to anticipate the effects of his informal remarks -- both in terms of content and in terms of style -- could cripple his effectiveness.'' 
 His critics say that Mr. Summers brings a hierarchical management style that is especially ill-suited to Harvard, a decentralized institution where much of the power resides with the deans of the university's 10 separate schools and where many faculty members have their own large egos as well as lifetime appointments. A president, they say, needs diplomatic skills to persuade the faculty to support his initiatives and work out compromises.
 ''For me it's sad that Harvard isn't able to benefit from all the upside potential of Summers as a leader because he doesn't know what kind of organization he's operating in,'' said Theda Skocpol, a professor of government. ''And he's often self-centered and discourages people around him.'' Professor Skocpol observed that Mr. Summers's advantages as a leader include his incisiveness and ability to ''identify a problem and throw out challenges.''
 Mr. Summers has made no secret that he intends to shake up Harvard and that intimidation may sometimes be required. In a mostly admiring article in the British newspaper The Guardian in October, he is quoted as saying, ''You know, sometimes fear does the work of reason.''
 Told that many faculty members had described him as a bully who squelches debate, Mr. Summers said the criticism was unjustified. ''I've not, since I've been here, resisted a meeting or a discussion with any faculty member on the university,'' he said. ''I've never suppressed anyone's views.''
 Told that many faculty members said he had created an atmosphere of intimidation, he said: ''I'm really sorry if that's true. It's certainly not my intent.''
 Even his critics say Mr. Summers is highly accessible. He might insult someone in a meeting, they say, and then telephone afterward to apologize and solicit their views. The problem, his critics say, is that his confrontational style and tendency to criticize the ideas of faculty members in front of their colleagues requires an equally combative response. And, as president, he has the upper hand in the battle.
 ''If you come back at him and hold your own, you come out all right,'' said Everett Mendelsohn, who has been a Harvard professor of the history of science for 40 years. ''I've done it on a number of occasions.'' But Professor Mendelsohn added that many of his colleagues, while no shrinking violets, nevertheless feel afraid to speak up.
 Professor Waters says she is not afraid of Mr. Summers. But she said she stopped going to meetings of the faculty advisory committee for the search for the dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences because she felt Mr. Summers was ignoring the faculty's views.

HEADLINE: Waffling On Gambling In Catskills

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Monticello, N.Y. 

 BODY:
YOU would think that after a half-century of efforts to bring casinos to the Catskills, it wouldn't be that hard to discern just what people think of a proposal that could mean five casinos, 2.7 million more cars and, one assumes, the retirement forever of a phrase, the Borscht Belt.
 But go to the second floor of the cavernous Sullivan County Government Center, which on a recent afternoon had the feel of a chilly Sam's Club or Costco minus the merchandise. There you'll find a county legislator, Ron Hiatt, sitting at his desk contemplating heaps of letters in rickety piles, some proclaiming casinos the salvation of the Catskills and others saying they are the agent of its doom.
 The letters are arranged in stacks of pro and con, further divided by letters from inside his district and outside it, and they reflect the continuing avalanche of feedback in public forums, letters to the editor, mailings, e-mail messages, lobbying campaigns and chit-chat over breakfast at Tillie's or shopping at Wal-Mart. 
 Everyone in the Catskills, it seems, has an opinion on casinos, but whether it's the same opinion they had a year ago, whether it's reflected by local governing boards and just how to gauge it is anyone's guess. Mr. Hiatt, one of five county legislators in varying degrees of indecision about casinos (two others are pro and two are con), figures that one of the few things that's clear is that the nearer the decision comes, the more likely that public opinion is slipping and sliding all over the lot.
 ''It's like being gung-ho about the idea of going skydiving,'' he said. ''Then all of a sudden you find yourself walking toward the plane with a parachute on your back, the engines roaring and the door open.'' 
 In the war of casino spin and counterspin, this is no small issue. It's hard to think of a proposal with more potential to transform an area than the one still taking shape a week before county legislators are expected to vote on it.
 A consultant's report last May said that three casinos -- the plan then -- would mean 18,000 new workers in a county that now has 30,000, 5,000 new students in a county with schools already packed, 2.7 million more cars and 90,000 more buses a year, a population increase of 30 percent and countless changes in the area's social fabric. 
 All of which is why bubbling beneath the debate over whether to have casinos is another one: should residents of Sullivan County have a vote on having them?
 Increasingly, residents, particularly those opposed, say if any proposal calls for a popular vote, this is it. Critics say casinos looked good when the old resort hotels began to die off and local boosters tried to come up with a way to recreate the hotels' success. But with its booming real estate market, post-9/11 refugees from New York City and a growing economy, Sullivan County is doing fine without casinos, the critics say. 
 ''A lot of folks who years ago felt the area was desperate for something now see a growing economy and think maybe this isn't a panacea,'' said Chris Cunningham, chair of the County Legislature and one of the two announced casino opponents in the body. ''And the proposal for five casinos changed the dynamic. One or two casinos wasn't perceived as overwhelming. Five, people are thinking, 'Do we really want to be the mini-Las Vegas of the East Coast?'''
 He supports a referendum. Both Mr. Hiatt, and his office mate, Legislator Sam Wohl, a casino supporter, said they could support one. But everything gets murky from there. Would a referendum be on one casino? Three? Five? Would it be a nonbinding referendum before a legislative vote or a binding one to ratify it? And is there a legal mechanism for either? The county attorney is researching the issue, but it's not at all clear that the law provides for any kind of popular vote.
 ''Our research clearly indicates that New York State law does not permit doing this referendum,'' said Josh Sommers, a spokesman for the Catskills Casino Coalition. ''In fact, particularly nonbinding referendums would be illegal.'' 
 In a deeply divided county -- call it blue chips versus red ones -- it is uncertain how a referendum would turn out. Mr. Wahl is fine with one because he thinks it would show support for casinos. And many pieces of the deals still need to be worked out.
 But it's also clear there is titanic political and financial muscle behind the casino plan, from the casino interests, labor groups and the Pataki administration.
 Opponents figure the best card they have to play might be an honest vote.

HEADLINE: White House Says Budget Deficit Will Rise Again

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
The White House announced on Tuesday that the federal budget deficit was expected to rise this year to $427 billion, a figure that includes a new request from President Bush to help pay for the war in Iraq.
 The White House's announcement makes it the fourth straight year in which the budget deficit was expected to grow; as recently as last July the administration had predicted that the deficit, which was $412 billion last year, would fall this year to $331 billion. 
 The deficit figure announced by the White House, which includes part of an additional $80 billion that Mr. Bush requested mostly for Iraq, was higher than the $368 billion estimate announced earlier in the day by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, though that figure did not include supplemental costs for the war. The deficit estimates are roughly consistent with each other with the inclusion of those costs, which cover bombs, bullets, armor for vehicles used in Iraq, and the replacement of tanks and Humvees blown up by insurgent forces. 
 Neither estimate includes the cost of privatizing part of the Social Security program, the leading element of Mr. Bush's domestic agenda. Estimates of the cost of creating those accounts range from $1 trillion to $2 trillion over the next two decades.
 The Congressional Budget Office noted that if Mr. Bush wins Congressional approval to make his tax cuts permanent, a top priority for the administration, the deficit would grow by $2 trillion over the next 10 years. If war costs in Iraq and Afghanistan taper off gradually, the agency estimated that price tag over the next 10 years could total nearly $600 billion. 
 In a briefing for reporters on Tuesday, senior administration officials insisted they were still on track to fulfill Mr. Bush's campaign promise of reducing the federal budget deficit by half by 2009. But Mr. Bush is already well behind in reaching his goal. The deficit this year will amount to about 3.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, a figure that is still below where the United States was in the late 1980's. 
 Beyond the war costs, administration officials did not spell out the precise reasons for the deficit increase. Tax receipts are expected to climb by about $200 billion in 2005, but mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid is expected to rise significantly faster than the rate of inflation. 
 Mr. Bush defended his $80 billion request for Iraq in a written statement on Tuesday -- he had no public events where he could be questioned about it by reporters -- saying ''our troops will have whatever they need to protect themselves and complete their mission.'' 
 But on Capitol Hill, Democrats made clear that while the $80 billion was likely to be approved, they would use the debate on it to question Mr. Bush's war strategy, just as they have done with the confirmation hearings for Condoleezza Rice, the nominee for secretary of state.
 The White House made no estimate of the cost of the war beyond the next year, being careful not to tip its hand about how long Mr. Bush expects American troops to remain. But on Monday, Lt. Gen. James J. Lovelace, the director of Army operations, said that the Army was operating on the assumption that the number of American troops in Iraq would remain above 100,000 through 2006. 
 One military expert who has been briefed by the Pentagon said on Tuesday that part of the $80 billion would be used to establish more permanent military bases in Iraq, assuming the new Iraqi government permits a long-term American military presence. The Congressional agency estimated that the war in Iraq and other military operations against terrorism could cost $285 billion over the next 5 years.
 Democrats quickly seized on the administration's announcement and the new Congressional deficit report, accusing Mr. Bush of making a bad fiscal situation worse by pushing for permanent tax cuts at a time of war. 
 ''The administration remains in denial about these fiscal results,'' said Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina and the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
 In contrast to the White House budget forecasts, which extend only 5 years, the Congressional projections look ahead 10 years and include many of Mr. Bush's most costly initiatives. For example, extending his tax cuts adds little to the deficits over 5 years but would add $1.8 trillion over 10 years. Preventing an expansion of the Alternative Minimum Tax, a parallel tax that was designed to prevent wealthy people from taking advantage of loopholes, would cost about $500 billion.
 Administration officials dispute the notion that creating private Social Security accounts would be as expensive as it first appears. They argue that the government would eventually save at least as much money as it spends by lowering the cost of future benefits to retirees. The government, however, might have to borrow as much as $100 billion a year over the next 20 years to pay full benefits to existing retirees, as even the administration has begun to acknowledge.
 Even without any changes to current law, the Congressional agency predicted that annual interest costs on the federal debt would almost double from $160 billion last year to $314 billion in 2012. That would be about six times what the federal government spent last year on education.
 White House officials provided few details about how they want to use the $80 billion in supplemental war costs that Mr. Bush plans to request.
 A senior administration official said on Tuesday that about $75 billion would go for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and would come on top of $25 billion that Congress already appropriated for the first few months of this fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1.
 Much of the request, which is a big jump from last year, is to cover rapidly rising costs of repairing and replacing equipment. Many soldiers and their families have complained about a shortage of properly armored vehicles. But Pentagon officials have been struggling even more with the wear and tear on tanks and weapons that are being used constantly in grueling conditions.
 One official said on Tuesday that Bradley fighting vehicles were being driven about 4,000 miles a year in Iraq, six times their normal mileage.
 The administration also intends to spend about $1 billion on technology and equipment to fend off ''improvised explosive devices,'' the roadside bombs that have killed hundreds of American soldiers and many more Iraqis over the last year.
 About $5 billion of the $80 billion would be used on programs like financial aid to Palestinians as they try to build a democratic government and a heavily fortified embassy in Iraq for the State Department.
 Administration officials predicted they would spend about $35 billion of the emergency request this year, and the balance in 2006 and later.
 The biggest fiscal problem confronting Mr. Bush is that more than 80 percent of the $2.3 trillion federal budget is currently off-limits for cutting. More than two-thirds of the annual budget goes to mandatory entitlement programs, mainly Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.
 More than $500 billion will go to the military and domestic security, not counting the extra money being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. Administration officials want to increase financing for the military and domestic security above the rate of inflation for the foreseeable future.
 That leaves less than $500 billion for all the other discretionary domestic programs, like space exploration, education and tax collection. Administration officials hope to freeze that spending at current levels, which would lead to real cuts after adjusting for inflation. But that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would save only about $9 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Judge Calls Catalog Outlet A Usurer In Disguise

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
A New York State trial judge has ruled that a catalog sales company in Watertown, N.Y., near the Army base at Fort Drum, is actually a lender in disguise -- one that has been making illegal short-term loans to military and civilian customers at annual interest rates of more than 700 percent. 
 The ruling, by Justice Bernard J. Malone Jr. of State Supreme Court in Albany, came in response to a lawsuit filed in September by the office of the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. It prohibits the company, N.Y. Catalog Sales, from making any new loans and nullifies any outstanding loans, freeing the borrowers from any obligation to repay the principal or the interest. 
 Under New York laws, borrowers who have repaid an illegal loan can recover only the illegal interest that they paid -- any amount higher than 16 percent a year. 
 Judge Malone's ruling, released late Monday, sets up a process to determine how much the company owes those borrowers, said Mark D. Fleischer, an assistant attorney general who worked on the case.
 A lawyer for N.Y. Catalog Sales, Roland Cavalier, said yesterday the company would appeal the decision.
 The company would allow customers to receive $100 cash by writing a check for $130. For that amount, the customers also received gift certificates with a face value of $30, which could be used to buy merchandise from the company's catalog. The company would hold the check until the customer's next payday and then either cash it or give it back to the customer, if the full amount -- $130 -- was repaid in cash.
 Judge Malone ruled that the transactions were short-term ''payday'' loans; borrowers did not actually want to buy gift certificates and few ever used them, he noted.
 Mr. Cavalier said the company would argue on appeal that the certificates had enough value to keep the loans from exceeding the state's usury limit.
 Judge Malone also ruled that the company used unlawful practices to collect the debts, making daily calls to the debtors and to ''supervisors and colleagues of debtor soldiers.'' 
 Finally, he determined that the company's founder, an Alabama businessman named John A. Gill Jr., was personally liable for loans made before he resigned in mid-2003.

HEADLINE: Bush Finds a Backer in Moynihan, Who's Not Talking

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
As he pushes ahead with his proposal to remake Social Security by adding private investment accounts, President Bush has so far failed to attract any prominent Democratic supporters.
 At least, no prominent Democrats who are still alive.
 Instead, Mr. Bush is taking cover under the reputation of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who died nearly two years ago. Mr. Moynihan served as co-chairman of the commission Mr. Bush established in 2001 to recommend ways of establishing personal accounts, a fact the president and his aides mention almost every time they discuss the issue publicly. 
 ''Much of my thinking has been colored by the work of the late Senator Moynihan and other members of the commission, who took a lot of time to take a look at this problem and who came up with some creative suggestions,'' Mr. Bush said to reporters last month in the Oval Office.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow began an op-ed article about Social Security in The Wall Street Journal recently by invoking Mr. Moynihan. Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, frequently refers to Mr. Moynihan's leadership of the commission in defending the president's call for personal accounts.
 But in implying that Mr. Moynihan was a supporter of his approach to Social Security, Mr. Bush and his team are open to challenge, based on Mr. Moynihan's record and documented indications that he was not totally happy with the commission's work. Moreover, their use of his name has drawn criticism from the Moynihan family and people who worked with him.
 ''It's confusing to me and my mom why they are constantly invoking him without presenting his position on Social Security,'' said Maura Moynihan, the senator's daughter, referring as well to his widow, Elizabeth.
 ''I think it's odd or strange or unsettling that the Democrat being invoked here is dead and not able to defend or explain his position, which we all know he would have done with eloquence and passion,'' said Ms. Moynihan, who described herself as a liberal who supported Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts in the presidential race.
 Mr. Moynihan was an early and prominent advocate of creating private investment accounts in Social Security and was often closer to the Republican position on the issue than to the predominant Democratic view. More than almost any elected official in either party, he openly advocated benefit cuts to assure the retirement system's long-term solvency.
 Neither party has ever been shy about citing examples where a high-ranking member of the other side might have crossed the ideological divide or taken a position at odds with a more recent partisan orthodoxy. Republicans love to cast John F. Kennedy as a proto-supply-sider who saw economic evil in high marginal tax rates. Democrats have often pointed to Vice President Dick Cheney's opposition, when Mr. Cheney was defense secretary in 1991, to a full-scale invasion of Iraq.
 In some ways, Mr. Moynihan was a perfect target for such treatment. He was an original and provocative thinker on all kinds of domestic issues, and his position on Social Security was nuanced. It shifted at times and was open to interpretation.
 But when it comes to individual accounts, the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's approach to an overhaul, Mr. Moynihan's preference, as expressed in legislation he sponsored in Congress and in a chairmen's introduction he helped write for the Bush commission report, was for an approach different from what the White House is advocating.
 The administration is pressing for accounts that would be financed out of the payroll tax levied on workers; the accounts would replace part of the benefit paid to retirees by the government. Mr. Moynihan favored accounts that would be layered on top of Social Security, paid for by taxes on top of those directed into Social Security, to supplement the government benefit payment.
 To many Democrats, there is a gulf between Mr. Bush's approach and Mr. Moynihan's, one that is being obscured by the White House.
 ''He supported Social Security plus,'' said Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator from Nebraska, who worked closely with Mr. Moynihan on Social Security legislation. ''He said it should be on top of Social Security, not a carve-out or something that would take away from the guaranteed benefit.''
 Mr. Kerrey said that if Mr. Moynihan were around, he would object to the way his views were being characterized.
 ''If somebody stood up and said, 'Pat Moynihan supports my proposal to carve out retirement accounts from Social Security,' he'd say: 'Like hell I do. I don't support that,''' Mr. Kerrey said.
 White House officials said their use of Mr. Moynihan's name was entirely appropriate, given his long record on the issue. They said he signed off on the commission report, which set out three detailed options for creating the kinds of private accounts that Mr. Bush is seeking to establish. More important, they said, Mr. Moynihan was a forceful and eloquent voice calling attention to long-term financial imbalances in the retirement system and was a courageous advocate of the steps needed to sustain the system, even when those steps were politically unpopular.
 ''Senator Moynihan was a statesman who was offering solutions to one of our nation's biggest challenges,'' said Claire Buchan, a spokeswoman for the White House. ''Our point is simply that we need to put politics aside and find a bipartisan solution to this problem.''
 Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner and a Republican, who served as the other co-chairman of the White House commission on Social Security, said Mr. Moynihan had been comfortable with all the proposals for personal accounts that had been set out by the group.
 ''Pat felt the introduction of a bit of ownership into the system and assuring funding for future operations was a good idea, and that there were different ways you could get at it,'' Mr. Parsons said. ''He was very much in favor of establishing the notion of private accounts, because he had this rap about how that was the fulfillment of the vision that F.D.R. had.''
 Mr. Moynihan retired from the Senate four years ago, just before Mr. Bush took office, so they had little history together before the president asked him, in the spring of 2001, to serve on the Social Security commission. But Mr. Moynihan had a long history of working across the aisle -- he served as an ambassador under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford -- and in public he was gracious to Mr. Bush, who in turn was complimentary toward the former senator and Harvard professor, a politician of a very different stripe.
 ''He found President Bush open to his ideas and suggestions, and liked him personally,'' Maura Moynihan said.
 Mr. Moynihan, though, left evidence that he was uncomfortable with some of the commission's work. In a memorandum prepared in October 2001 by a Treasury Department official for Paul H. O'Neill, who was then the Treasury secretary, Mr. Moynihan was described as being in favor of an ''add-on'' plan, in which workers could contribute to a personal investment account one percentage point of their taxable earnings on top of their regular payroll tax. The government would then match that contribution out of general revenues.
 Mr. Moynihan's approach was similar to ones he had advocated while he was in the Senate, but it was very different from the ones the commission ultimately put forward.
 The memorandum was provided by Mr. O'Neill to the author Ron Suskind and made public by Mr. Suskind on the Web site for his book about Mr. O'Neill, ''The Price of Loyalty.'' It was intended to brief Mr. O'Neill before a meeting with Mr. Moynihan as the commission was nearing the completion of its work. It concluded by saying that Mr. Moynihan ''has expressed a considerable amount of frustration that he is not being allowed to control the agenda and, in particular, that the White House and commission staff are controlling the agenda to a large extent.'' 
 Mr. Moynihan's plan was not among those that the commission unanimously agreed to include in its final report, in December 2001. In an effort to get the last word, he wedged it into the report by including it in the introduction, noting that it would cost the government $40 billion a year, leave a 21-year-old with more than half a million dollars in savings at retirement and ''might or might not interact directly with the Social Security system.''

HEADLINE: Making a Fortune by Wagering That Drug Prices Tend to Rise

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
Stewart Rahr's new $45 million East Hampton estate, the most expensive house ever purchased in New York State, is just across the pond from Steven Spielberg's. Mr. Rahr plays golf with Donald Trump and practices putting on an indoor green in the basement of his warehouse in Queens. He and his wife, Carol, last drew attention in 2003 when they bought four works of art, including a Renoir and a Picasso, in one sitting at Sotheby's.
 But as he becomes increasingly visible as one of New York's wealthiest men, Mr. Rahr, a 58-year-old law school dropout, is girding himself for the elimination of the system that helped generate his fortune. His success offers a rare glimpse into a lucrative but little-known corner of the pharmaceutical industry -- the once-mundane business of delivering drugs from manufacturers to pharmacies. 
 Over the last 20 years, the packing and shipping of drugs evolved into a game of arbitrage, called speculative buying, with distributors like Mr. Rahr wagering on drug price increases. 
 This common industry practice seems more fitting to a casino than a distribution warehouse. And in the 1990's and the early years of this decade, with prices far outstripping inflation, it was a sure bet.
 Knowing that drug manufacturers typically increased prices at the same time, often in January, drug middlemen like Mr. Rahr, the sole owner of Kinray, which is based in Queens, made millions by overstocking their warehouses before manufacturers announced price increases. By acquiring extra inventory at the lower price, distributors made quick profits once they sold the drugs at higher prices a short time later to retail pharmacies. 
 Prescription drug prices are a combustible political issue, and manufacturers feel intense pressure to restrain them. With their historically large profits threatened, and with regulators questioning aspects of the speculative buying system, the manufacturers have taken steps to shut it by limiting distributors to just one month's worth of inventory. Drug manufacturers have also begun using special software to help detect speculative buying.
 Mr. Rahr would not disclose exactly how much he made through speculative buying. Goldman Sachs estimated that the distribution industry, which is dominated by three large public companies, made 60 percent of its profit, or $980 million, from speculative buying in 2001, when the practice was at its peak. More recently, Goldman Sachs estimated speculative buying's contribution at 40 percent of profits.
 Mr. Rahr, who honed the practice with the help of a computer program, said that his profit from the practice never reached 40 percent.
 Mr. Rahr also said that his and other distributors' fees accounted for a tiny portion of the cost of drugs to consumers, with manufacturers taking the major share of profits.
 ''We're talking an infinitesimal impact on the consumer, based on the total cost of the health care industry,'' Mr. Rahr said. ''Whether there is spec buying or not is not the greatest factor in the high cost of pharmaceuticals.''
 In some ways, the practice helped drug manufacturers, who relied on speculative buying in lieu of paying distributors to get drugs to pharmacies. In effect, it was a form of hidden compensation that never showed up as a cost to manufacturers. But speculative buying fostered many problems, industry analysts and economists said. Some say it played a role in drug cost inflation by adding an incentive for manufacturers to raise prices repeatedly. It also sometimes gave drug makers false signals that products were in demand, prompting them to turn out excess product.
 By encouraging distributor stockpiling, the system also led to shortages in some regions of the country, a situation known as a ''stock out'' and one that the industry does not like to discuss. Last year, Bristol-Myers Squibb paid $150 million to settle allegations, without admitting or denying guilt, that it misled investors by aggressively encouraging wholesalers to flood their warehouses, thus artificially inflating its sales. 
 The case, brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, was the beginning of the end of speculative buying, as other manufacturers worried that they, too, might run afoul of securities laws. ''It was a dysfunctional model,'' said Ken Abramowitz, an analyst and managing general partner at NGN Capital, a health care venture capital company in New York.
 Exactly how much retail drug prices have been affected by speculative buying is an open question. Adam J. Fein, a Philadelphia business economist, says that the end of speculative buying can reduce the rate of drug price inflation by one or two percentage points a year. 
 Based on the 5.3 percent increase in retail drug prices in 2003, as calculated by IMS Health, a pharmaceutical-market research company, consumers could save $2.2 billion to $4.4 billion annually. 
 Others agree that speculative buying created inflationary pressures, but are more concerned that ending the practice will drive up retail prices if distributors, who operate on slim profit margins, are forced to pass any costs to retail pharmacies.
 ''They'll have to make up their margins somewhere that they aren't getting from the manufacturer,'' said Steven W. Schondelmeyer, a University of Minnesota professor who studies the economics of the pharmaceutical industry. ''They'll raise the prices to the pharmacies. The pharmacies have very thin margins to begin with, and all they can do is pass it on to consumers.'' 
 Experts agree, however, that consumers will benefit in at least one way. Speculative buying helped foster a secondary pharmaceutical market, with some distributors reselling extra drugs they did not need to other distributors.
 ''It invited the risk of the type of counterfeit and adulterated market that we saw with some of the biotech drugs and Lipitor,'' said Christopher McFadden, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
 The shift away from speculative buying has put pharmaceutical distribution at a critical point, according to Mr. Fein, whose company, Pembroke Consulting, advises both manufacturers and distributors.
 ''Of course it's affected our business,'' said Mr. Rahr, who said he had no plans to raise prices to compensate for the loss of profit from speculative buying. Instead, he said that his company was working harder to control costs and expand its territory. ''Volume, volume, volume,'' he said. 
 The transformation has also affected bottom lines at the three large public pharmaceutical distribution companies -- AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson. 
 Today, they deliver 90 percent of the $220 billion in drugs sold in the United States. As distributors try to recoup, they have become engaged in what Mr. Fein said were tough negotiations with manufacturers, asking that they pay fees for distributing drugs to pharmacies. 
 ''The question is, How much more value or how much more fees is the manufacturing community going to be willing to pay?'' Mr. McFadden said. ''It's kind of whatever you can negotiate.''
 In one of the first of these ''fee for service'' deals, Eli Lilly recently announced it had struck an agreement with Cardinal Health, but neither side disclosed terms.
 Last week, Eisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, announced that it had broken off negotiations with Cardinal Health and warned patients of potential disruptions in the supply of drugs to treat Alzheimer's, epilepsy and gastrointestinal problems. Three days later, the companies announced that they had reached a deal, after all. 
 Pfizer, the giant pharmaceutical manufacturer, said last week that it would not negotiate fee agreements with distributors. 
 ''Someone like Pfizer says, 'the fact that you lost money is not my problem,''' said Mr. Abramowitz, the health care analyst. 
 As his profit margin narrows -- Mr. Rahr describes it as ''razor thin'' -- Mr. Rahr is expressing confidence that Kinray will prosper even without speculative buying, based on its efficiency, low costs and the fact that he has no debt.
 His company has established a national telemarketing office that makes cold calls to pharmacies across the country. Mr. Rahr, whose company employs about 1,000 people, is expanding his business in home health equipment like walkers and bedpans, as well as generic drugs, both areas with higher profit margins than brand-name drugs, where he makes less than 2 cents on the dollar.
 ''We do all this work for pennies,'' Mr. Rahr said. ''But like my father said, 'pennies do add up to dollars.''' Last year, the pennies added up to $3.1 billion in sales. 
 Mr. Rahr's business, he said, is dependent on a large computer-operated picking system that fills orders from among 34,000 items in the company's 400,000-foot warehouse. The items, he said, include anything a drugstore would sell.
 ''I'd be out of business without this technology,'' he said.
 Despite his wealth, Mr. Rahr still exudes Queens from every pore. He is gregarious and down to earth, perpetually tanned, and seems both proud of his success and slightly apologetic about it, emphasizing that he still wears a $19.95 watch and drives himself to work in a 10-year-old Jeep Cherokee. 
 He loves to tell stories about how a headwaiter or a security guard stopped him because he was wearing his usual attire, a baseball cap and jeans. ''My wife's used to it,'' he said. ''I identify with the underdog.'' 
 He specializes in sales to 3,000 independent drugstores in seven Northeastern states. Mr. Rahr says he controls 75 percent of that market. Among the druggists, Kinray is known for its easy-to-use Web site.
 It has been 36 years since Mr. Rahr dropped out of New York Law School and persuaded his father, Joseph Rahr, not to sell the family's retail pharmacy in Brooklyn, which also supplied a few other drugstores. 
 Mr. Rahr recently described the rejection he felt at first, when he tried to expand the wholesale business.
 ''I used to call the pharmacies and I would call and say, 'Kinray,' and they'd say, 'Nothing for you today.' And after about three or four in a row, I would get, 'Here's three aspirin for you and two Colgate toothpaste and one Mennen Speed Stick, if I were lucky,''' Mr. Rahr recalled. ''And the sound of them hanging up on me, the 'nothing for you today,' just started to make me feel like I had to do something to get to become the primary jobber in these stores.'' In 1973, Mr. Rahr and his wife, now a partner in a Manhattan jewelry design firm, Beach to Ballroom, bought their first home on one acre in suburban Dix Hills, N.Y. 
 The Hamptons estate is considerably more grand, and Mr. Rahr sees it as his crowning achievement.
 It sits on 25 acres. The main house is 18,000 square feet, with 8 bedrooms and 14 baths, a private 2,000-foot beach with its own dock and boathouse, a waterside heated pool with waterfall and whirlpool, a tennis court and viewing pavilion, and a greenhouse. Mr. Rahr said that buying the property was an emotional experience for him. 
 ''Here we were, 32 years later, walking on a much larger estate and feeling blessed that we were able to be in this position,'' he said. 
 Mr. Rahr says he has never borrowed a penny, so in a few days, when the deal closes on the oceanfront mansion, called Burnt Point, he will pay cash.

HEADLINE: Winning Cases, Losing Voters

BYLINE: By Paul Starr. 
Paul Starr is the co-editor of The American Prospect and the author, most recently, of ''The Creation of the Media.''

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
AS Republicans revel in President Bush's inauguration and prepare for his agenda-setting State of the Union address next week, many Democrats would like to consider almost anything but the substance of politics as the reason for their defeat last November. If only John Kerry had been a stronger candidate. If only the message had been framed differently. If only the party's strategists were as tough as the guys on the other side. 
 The limits of candidates and campaigns, however, can't explain the Democrats' long-term decline. And while the institutional decay at the party's base -- the decline of labor unions and ethnically based party organizations -- has played a role, the people who point to ''moral values'' may not be far off. Democrats have paid a historic price for their role in the great moral revolutions that during the past half-century have transformed relations between whites and blacks, men and women, gays and straights. And liberal Democrats, in particular, have been inviting political oblivion -- not by advocating the wrong causes, but by letting their political instincts atrophy and relying on the legal system. 
 To be sure, Democrats were right to challenge segregation and racism, support the revolution in women's roles in society, to protect rights to abortion and to back the civil rights of gays. But a party can make only so many enemies before it loses the ability to do anything for the people who depend on it. For decades, many liberals thought they could ignore the elementary demand of politics -- winning elections -- because they could go to court to achieve these goals on constitutional grounds. The great thing about legal victories like Roe v. Wade is that you don't have to compromise with your opponents, or even win over majority opinion. But that is also the trouble. An unreconciled losing side and unconvinced public may eventually change the judges.
 And now we have reached that point. The Republicans, with their party in control of both elected branches -- and looking to create a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that will stand for a generation -- see the opportunity to overthrow policies and constitutional precedents reaching back to the New Deal. 
 That prospect ought to concentrate the liberal mind. Social Security, progressive taxation, affordable health care, the constitutional basis for environmental and labor regulation, separation of church and state -- these issues and more hang in the balance.
 Under these circumstances, liberal Democrats ought to ask themselves a big question: are they better off as the dominant force in an ideologically pure minority party, or as one of several influences in an ideologically varied party that can win at the polls? The latter, it seems clear, is the better choice.
 Rebuilding a national political majority will mean distinguishing between positions that contribute to a majority and those that detract from it. As last year's disastrous crusade for gay marriage illustrated, Democrats cannot allow their constituencies to draw them into political terrain that can't be defended at election time. Dissatisfied with compromise legislation on civil unions and partner benefits, gay organizations thought they could get from judges, beginning with those on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, what the electorate was not yet ready to give. The result: bans on same-sex marriage passing in 11 states and an energized conservative voting base. 
 Public support for abortion rights is far greater than for gay marriage, but compromise may be equally imperative -- especially if a reshaped Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade by finding that there is no constitutional right to abortion and throws the issue back to the states. Some savvy Democrats are already thinking along these lines, as Hillary Clinton showed this week when she urged liberals to find ''common ground'' with those who have misgivings about abortion. 
 And if a new Supreme Court overturns affirmative-action laws, Democrats will need to pursue equality in ways that avoid treating whites and blacks differently. Some liberals have long been calling for an emphasis on ''race neutral'' economic policies to recover support among working-class and middle-income white voters. Legal and political necessity may now drive all Democrats in that direction.
 Republicans are leaving themselves open to this kind of strategy. Their party is far more ideologically driven and more beholden to the Christian right than it was even during the Ronald Reagan era. This is the source of the party's energy, but also its vulnerability. The Democrats' opportunity lies in becoming a broader, more open and flexible coalition that can occupy the center. 
 In the long run, Democrats will benefit from their strength among younger voters and the growing Hispanic population. But the last thing the Democrats need is a revived interest group or identity politics. As the response to Senator Barack Obama's convention speech showed, the party's own members are looking for an expansive statement of American character and national purpose. 
 Secure in their own lives at home, Americans can be a great force for good in the world. That is the liberalism this country once heard from Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy -- and it is the only form of liberalism that will give the Democratic Party back its majority.

HEADLINE: 60 Companies Plan to Sponsor Health Coverage For Uninsured

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
In a novel attempt to extend health coverage to uninsured workers, 60 large employers are joining together to sponsor an array of low-cost health insurance options. The program, to begin in the fall, will be offered for at least two years and is intended to cover uninsured part-time and temporary workers, contractors, consultants and early retirees, who typically are not eligible for employer health plans.
 The sponsors, which include General Electric, I.B.M., McDonald's and Sears, Roebuck, will begin promoting the low-cost plans in April and May to 3 million eligible workers, about 7 percent of the 45 million uninsured Americans. They hope that several hundred thousand people will sign up at the start. 
 The employers will not subsidize the coverage, but their participation created a pool of potential participants sufficiently large to justify lower insurance rates than individuals would have to pay on their own. 
 These options, to be offered to part-time employees, are not intended to replace employer-paid health plans that are already in place for full-time workers. The sponsors also acknowledged that these low-cost plans will not by themselves solve the problem of the uninsured. 
 The plans will range widely in cost from $5 a month for a card that provides users with discounts for doctors and pharmacies to more than $300 a month for a high-deductible plan that covers major medical and hospital expenses. 
 UnitedHealth Group will offer the four lowest-cost options in all 50 states. UnitedHealth and Humana will offer the major medical policies in states where they have been approved by regulators. Cigna will offer the program's major medical option in Arizona.
 ''Nothing like this has ever been done before,'' said Andy Slavitt, a UnitedHealth executive. 
 The 60 employers are supporting this program because they say they ultimately pay for the uninsured as hospitals pass on their costs for nonpaying patients. They expect the program to help reduce employee turnover and increase productivity among part-timers.
 The low-cost options, they said, could also help older employees maintain some form of health coverage if they choose to stop working full time but cannot afford $25,000 or more a year to buy their own coverage.
 Leaders in the group expressed hope that government policy makers might consider this approach in making health coverage more affordable. It may also be a way for employers to stave off proposed state mandates for coverage of uninsured workers.
 In a referendum last fall, California voters overturned a 2003 law requiring companies to buy health insurance for workers and their families.
 ''We have a model that doesn't require enabling legislation,'' said Tom Beauregard, a health strategy specialist at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. ''The private sector can't wait for the government to act.''
 Beginning in September, all participants in the program will receive a card providing discounts from doctors, pharmacies and hospitals. 
 As an example, the card alone, without other benefits, will cost a 19-year-old woman working part time in Orlando, Fla., about $5 a month. The discounted price of a month's supply of the widely used cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, for example, would be $106.25, or $7.65 off the average retail price, UnitedHealth Group said. 
 For three different levels of monthly premiums, from $50 to $110, the Florida woman and her dependents would be covered for a varying number of medical services, including $450 a year for visits to doctors and deeper discounts on 10 drug prescriptions a year. For higher premiums, $264 and $303 a month, she could get a high-deductible major medical policy with a health savings account.
 In recent surveys, uninsured workers said they would appreciate having a low-cost discount card. ''Mothers wanted a card so they could take a child to a pediatrician instead of an emergency room,'' said Greg A. Lee, senior vice president of Sears, which has 100,000 part-time employees. 
 Mr. Lee, who led a committee that developed the low-cost package under the auspices of the HR Policy Association, a group of senior officials of large companies, said the association hoped that more companies would join the original 60 corporate sponsors. ''If we can make the pool even larger, there is a good chance we will be able to continue to lower the price,'' he said. 
 The association plans to introduce the program at a conference of employers and consultants in Washington on Monday. For many uninsured workers, the premiums for even the high-deductible plans that some employers offer are unaffordable. ''The average person who makes $30,000 a year spends $1,500 more than they make and has less than $500 in assets,'' Mr. Slavitt of UnitedHealth said. ''Offering them insurance with a deductible is equivalent to not providing insurance at all.'' 
 Older employees thinking of retiring before they become eligible for Medicare are often ''stunned to find that their health care premiums could easily be $20,000,'' said Jack Mollen, a senior vice president of EMC, an information management and storage technology company based in Hopkinton, Mass. ''With the baby boomers getting older, companies will want to have programs that encourage more senior employees to go to part-time work or consulting,'' he added. 
 The appeal for early retirees is ''the No.1 sweet spot'' in the program, said Dr. Robert S. Galvin, director of global health care for G.E. Although most G.E. employees have comprehensive health coverage, he notes that the company has acquired a number of small companies that can participate in the low-cost program. ''We will be offering it,'' he said. 
 Dr. Galvin said the sponsors of the new program had asked the insurers to join G.E. and other large employers that were trying to persuade doctors and hospitals to meet quality and efficiency standards. 
 Workers in the low-cost program will also be able to compare health care providers on the program's Web site, he said. 
 ''Being uninsured doesn't mean you want to be uninformed,'' Dr. Galvin said.
 Mr. Beauregard of Hewitt Associates said the number of uninsured people would rise significantly in the next five years as employment continues the shift from manufacturing with strong unions to nonunion service jobs, often in small companies that do not offer health benefits. Even large businesses, he noted, are dropping retiree medical coverage. 
 ''It is extraordinarily important,'' he said, ''to address the issue of the uninsured for social, economic and even moral reasons.''

HEADLINE: HUD Aid Short By $50 Million, City Reports

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The New York City Housing Authority said yesterday that the federal government would provide $50 million less than what the agency needs to provide rent vouchers for low-income residents this year, a gap that agency officials fear could hamper their ability to house the poorest tenants.
 The budget gap, part of a nationwide squeeze by the Bush administration in spending on housing programs, could mean that the authority would have to reduce the number of planned vouchers by more than 6,000 this year from the city's current 118,000. Agency officials have said they hope to avoid evicting any tenants, but will most likely cut back on new tenants and will not be able to replace those who leave. 
 ''The burden this reality places on the city's public housing authority will be far-reaching and test our ability to assist families who need affordable housing and rely on Section 8 assistance,'' said Tino Hernandez, the housing authority's chairman. ''The reality is our options are very limited, given the magnitude of the federal government's funding reduction.'' 
 At the same time, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development reported that the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development had agreed to increase its financing for rent vouchers by $27 million. The department generally provides Section 8 vouchers to residents with higher incomes than the tenants of the Housing Authority, who are among the city's poorest residents.
 Taken together, the various city agencies issue about 118,000 Section 8 vouchers at a cost of about $1 billion. The net loss to the city, given the increase and the shortfall, will be about $23 million.
 And the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal said that it had received $1.8 million less than it needed for the rent vouchers it distributes, including $500,000 for New York City.
 In interviews yesterday, city officials said they were still coming to grips with the impact of HUD's decisions on the Section 8 program, which allows poor, disabled or elderly tenants to live in private apartments and pays part of their rent directly to landlords. But in the past, officials have said that any shortfall could force them to limit the number of vouchers for families on years-long waiting lists or pay landlords in the program less money. That could mean that landlords would drop out of the program, giving poor tenants fewer choices.
 ''These numbers, if put into effect, would be devastating to the people who can least afford it in New York,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, who vowed to fight the spending decision. ''Section 8 is a successful program and there is no reason that HUD should take a meat-ax approach. We have been promised a appeal, and we hope that HUD will re-examine these numbers.''
 Around the country, 492 out of an estimated 2,500 housing agencies that issue vouchers had asked HUD for more money. Late yesterday, Donna White, a spokeswoman for HUD, said that she did not have a specific breakdown of how many of those requests were successful and for how much money.
 But in a letter on Friday to housing agencies, David A. Vargas, HUD's director of housing voucher programs, explained that the agency had determined that the total amount of money needed for voucher renewals, based on costs through July 2004, was $13.9 billion. But because Congress appropriated only $13.4 billion, and is requiring housing agencies to stay within their allocations for the entire year, he said, HUD had to pare the financing to all housing agencies by 4 percent.
 In the past, the federal housing department financed agencies for all the vouchers they were allowed to issue, based on actual costs. But last year, the Bush administration, concerned about the rising costs of Section 8, began to limit the program's flexibility and move toward fixed costs. 
 To HUD officials and some housing groups, this approach is preferable because it forces housing agencies to plan more effectively and contain costs.
 But the problem this year, some housing advocacy groups contend, is that Congress allocated less money to adjust for possible needs after the July cutoff date. Agencies had had a reserve fund of up to one month in subsidies after 2001, but that reserve is about to be reduced to one week. As a result, many agencies will probably offer fewer vouchers so as not to run out of money.
 The city's housing department received more money than the housing authority because it calculates its costs differently, local officials said. In addition, they said, HUD's formula, set by Congress, tends to favor the working-class and middle-class families who receive their vouchers from the housing department. Many of those families get rent vouchers because they live in Mitchell-Lama developments or other buildings with subsidies that are set to expire.

HEADLINE: Buildings That Don't Forget Air and Space

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
In Mexico City, where zoning codes are ambiguous and the economy unpredictable at best, civic planning is often a low priority. But ''when government agencies don't deal with the creation of communal space, the architects do,'' said Jose Castillo, himself an architect in the city and a curator of ''Mexico City Dialogues: New Architectural Practices,'' a show opening tonight at the Center for Architecture in New York. 
The show features 14 recent projects, including Derek Dellekamp's AR58 apartment building, above left, in the fashionable Condesa district. The building's seven boxy apartments, made from corrugated and flat aluminum, are stacked to create voids between units as well as an interior courtyard and communal interior gardens reached by bridges. 
 In converting the 13 de Septiembre building, above right, in the Escandon district from a two-story warehouse to apartments, Javier Sanchez sliced it in half to create an open corridor for communal space and added a third floor faced with aluminum siding. Mauricio Rocha also used corrugated sheet metal -- an inexpensive material ubiquitous in Mexico -- for the multiple boxes, top right, with which he replaced the tents of the old San Pablo farmers' market in Milpa Alta, the most rural precinct in the city. The units are separated by corrugated metal louvered shades which, when rolled up, allow the market to continue as an open community center. The show runs through May 7 at the Center for Architecture, 536 LaGuardia Place (Bleecker Street). Admission is free. Information: (212)683-0023 or www.aiany.org. ELAINE LOUIE

HEADLINE: The Jingle Can Be Annoying, Mr. Softee Admits, but a Threat?

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
He was the star witness, and had come before the City Council to speak on one of the Bloomberg administration's more controversial proposals. With the news media closely watching, James Conway Jr., the scion of the family that founded Mister Softee, had an admission to make: the Mister Softee ditty, a staple of urban summer, could be so annoying that even he would not want it playing outside his house all day.
 ''Does it get stuck in your head occasionally?'' he said. ''We hope so. But the Mister Softee song as a threat to the health and welfare of New Yorkers? I don't think so.'' 
 The jingle, with its lyrics, ''Listen for my store on wheels, ding-a-ling down the street,'' has become a flashpoint in the debate over revising the city's noise code. From dogs that bark too long to nightclubs that draw neighbors' complaints, the administration wants new restrictions, but it found wide-ranging opposition at yesterday's City Council hearing. 
 Also speaking out against the administration's plan was the New York Nightlife Association, which contended that some of the city's hottest nightclubs would become sitting ducks for a newly empowered noise police. And a coalition of labor unions protested that picket lines and demonstrations could also become easy targets.
 These critics say that while they are not opposed to updating the code, the current plan is too vague and could impose an unnecessary expense and burden on many businesses while doing little to combat problems like early morning construction and noisy smokers gathered on the street.
 ''In the real world, the current code is a joke, and this is worse,'' said David Rabin, the co-owner of the nighclub Lotus and president of the nightlife association. 
 In a city with no shortage of complainers, excessive noise in any form -- the ricochet of jackhammers, the thumping of club music, the drone of air-conditioners -- has long fostered complaints. The Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the noise code, receives an average of 3,500 complaints a month.
 David B. Tweedy, the agency's acting commissioner, said the city wants to reduce sound levels by adopting more enforceable regulations on construction, air-conditioners, and bars and clubs that play music, among other things. To encourage cooperation, he said, no penalties would be levied for a first offense if the person or business agreed to make changes to comply with the code.
 In addition, enforcement officers would be allowed to issue violations for ''plainly audible'' sounds coming from commercial music establishments, personal audio devices and exhausts on cars and motorcycles. Currently, they are required to register potential offenses on handheld decibel meters, which they say require frequent adjustments and are prone to error.
 ''This proposal provides a flexible approach to address the No. 1 quality-of-life complaint,'' Mr. Tweedy said. ''And balances the need for construction, development and nightlife with the need for peace and quiet enjoyment for the city's residents.''
 But several council members expressed skepticism about the plan and pledged to vote against it. Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who represents the Lower East Side and the East Village, said the new regulations could be used to harass businesses and called the plan ''a threat to the economic development of my community.''
 While the four-hour hearing was packed with critics of the city's plan, there were also many supporters, including frustrated residents and members of a group known as Noise, which is short for Neighbors Against Noxious Odors, Incessant Sounds and Emissions. 
 But it was Mister Softee that drew the most interest. Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn told Mr. Tweedy: ''You and the mayor are very bold taking on Mister Softee. You're going to traumatize a lot of children in this city.''
 Mr. Conway said that the current plan would not only silence the 347 Mister Softee trucks that operate in the city but also disappoint more than 120,000 customers. Instead, Mr. Conway proposed a compromise: stop the music only when trucks are parked for a certain length of time.
 Anything more, he said, would cause sales to plummet.
 ''To get a sense of what this would do to us, remember when you were a kid,'' he said. ''You heard the jingle, you grabbed your money and you ran to the truck. The way you knew Mister Softee was in the neighborhood was the song.''

HEADLINE: Chile's Retirees Find Shortfall In Private Plan

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile 

 BODY:
Nearly 25 years ago, Chile embarked on a sweeping experiment that has since been emulated, in one way or another, in a score of other countries. Rather than finance pensions through a system to which workers, employers and the government all contributed, millions of people began to pay 10 percent of their salaries to private investment accounts that they controlled.
 Under the Chilean program -- which President Bush has cited as a model for his plans to overhaul Social Security -- the promise was that such investments, by helping to spur economic growth and generating higher returns, would deliver monthly pension benefits larger than what the traditional system could offer.
 But now that the first generation of workers to depend on the new system is beginning to retire, Chileans are finding that it is falling far short of what was originally advertised under the authoritarian government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
 For all the program's success in economic terms, the government continues to direct billions of dollars to a safety net for those whose contributions were not large enough to ensure even a minimum pension approaching $140 a month. Many others -- because they earned much of their income in the underground economy, are self-employed, or work only seasonally -- remain outside the system altogether. Combined, those groups constitute roughly half the Chilean labor force. Only half of workers are captured by the system. 
 Even many middle-class workers who contributed regularly are finding that their private accounts -- burdened with hidden fees that may have soaked up as much as a third of their original investment -- are failing to deliver as much in benefits as they would have received if they had stayed in the old system.
 Dagoberto Saez, for example, is a 66-year-old laboratory technician here who plans, because of a recent heart attack, to retire in March. He earns just under $950 a month; his pension fund has told him that his nearly 24 years of contributions will finance a 20-year annuity paying only $315 a month.
 ''Colleagues and friends with the same pay grade who stayed in the old system, people who work right alongside me,'' he said, ''are retiring with pensions of almost $700 a month -- good until they die. I have a salary that allows me to live with dignity, and all of a sudden I am going to be plunged into poverty, all because I made the mistake of believing the promises they made to us back in 1981.''
 With many Chileans finding themselves in a situation much like that of Mr. Saez, people are still looking to the government, not private pension funds, to ensure a secure retirement.
 ''It is evident the system requires reform,'' the minister of labor and social security, Ricardo Scolari, said in an interview here. Chile's current approach based on private pension funds has ''important strengths,'' he said, but ''it is absolutely impossible to think that a system of this nature is going to resolve the income needs of Chileans when they reach old age.''
 In formulating proposals in the United States for individual accounts, advocates of partial privatization of Social Security have sought to overcome some of the problems in Chile. They have suggested, for example, setting low limits on the fees that fund managers will be allowed to charge and continuing to provide a major part of retirement income through the traditional system of guaranteed payments.
 The program in Chile differs from the voluntary model that President Bush is considering. Participation here has been not voluntary for people entering the labor force since 1981.
 On the other hand, Chile was careful before it started its private system to accumulate several years of budget surpluses, in contrast to the recent large deficits in the United States. 
 The Chilean example also makes clear that introducing private accounts does not solve a lot of the problems faced in the United States, Europe and Japan, where pay-as-you-go systems remain the principal means of government retirement support.
 Over all, Chile has spent more than $66 billion on benefits since privatization was introduced. Despite initial projections that the system would be self-sustaining by now, spending on pensions makes up more than a quarter of the national budget, nearly as much as the spending on education and health combined.
 Faced with the likelihood of the gap remaining as it is or, as Mr. Scolari said, ''perhaps even widening,'' the Chilean government is contemplating a new round of pension changes. Suggestions that have been floated include many also under consideration in the United States and Europe, like reducing benefits or setting a higher retirement age.
 The problems have emerged despite what all here agree is the main strength of the privatized system: an average 10 percent annual return on investments. Those results have been achieved by the pension funds largely through the purchase of stocks and corporate and government bonds -- investments that helped fuel an economic expansion giving Chile the highest growth rate in Latin America over the last 20 years.
 ''The great success of the system is its high profit rate, more than double what was initially projected,'' said Guillermo Arthur Errazuriz, executive director of the Association of Pension Fund Administrators. ''In total, workers have set aside nearly $61 billion, which is invested in the sectors of the economy that show the most potential.''
 Among the admirers of the privatized system here is Mr. Bush, who on a visit in November called Chile ''a great example'' for other countries. On other occasions, he has suggested that the United States could ''take some lessons from Chile, particularly when it comes to how to run our pension plans.''
 The main architect of the Chilean system is Jose Pinera, who was labor and social security minister from 1978 to 1980 during the Pinochet dictatorship. Mr. Pinera is now chairman of the International Center for Pension Reform, co-chairman of the Cato Institute's Project on Social Security Choice, and he has been a board member of several Chilean corporations.
 Mr. Pinera declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article. In an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times last month, though, he extolled the Chilean system as one based on ownership, choice and responsibility and one that is widely popular because it gives workers a stake in the economy.
 Among other achievements emphasized here by advocates of the privatized funds are the creation of a modern capital market, cheaper credit for companies that formerly could turn only to banks when they wanted to expand, and a brake on deficit spending by the government. 
 Critics respond that the privatized system has been less successful in ensuring a dignified retirement for the elderly.
 ''What we have is a system that is good for Chile but bad for most Chileans,'' said a government official who specializes in pension issues and who spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation from corporate interests. ''If people really had freedom of choice, 90 percent of them would opt to go back to the old system.''
 Among the complaints most often heard here is that contributors are forced to pay exorbitant commissions to the pension funds. Exactly how much goes to such fees is a subject of debate, but a recent World Bank study calculated that a quarter to a third of all contributions paid by a person retiring in 2000 would have gone to pay such charges.
 But most Chileans are unaware of how much they are paying to the funds because the lengthy quarterly financial balance sheet they receive ''is not comprehensible,'' according to Guillermo Larrain, director of the Superintendency of Pension Funds, a government agency. ''It needs to be replaced by a simple and transparent financial statement,'' he said, so workers can determine which fund charges the lowest fees.
 In recent years, the number of pension funds has been winnowed to 6 from a high of 22 in the early 1990's. They have enjoyed record earnings, so much so that foreign banks and insurance companies are investing in the industry. While the pension fund association puts the average annual return on assets just under 30 percent, government figures show profits of 50 percent in 2000, with some independent studies suggesting the funds did that well over the five-year period ended in 2003.
 Proponents of the system justify the high returns as an appropriate reward for the risk they undertake. But a recent World Bank report, ''Keeping the Promise of Social Security in Latin America,'' minimized that, noting that through the 1990's, only three large companies accounted for half of all shares traded on the Santiago stock exchange and that pension funds tend to follow a herd instinct and invest in the safest choices on the market.
 Government officials like Mr. Larrain and Mr. Scolari acknowledge that ''commissions are high and need to come down.'' They say that ''more competition is needed'' to foster lower fees. But existing regulations frustrate the creation of new funds -- something that seems just fine to pension funds that have become a powerful political and economic force.
 ''The dynamic of the market,'' Mr. Larrain said, ''is one of consolidation and concentration.''
 Some other problems of the Chilean system stem from factors that do not apply with the same force in the United States and other advanced economies. Nearly half of Chilean workers, for example, are employed off the books in the so-called informal sector, while many others are hired as independent contractors, who are not required to contribute to a pension account and do not do so regularly because they cannot afford it.
 By the government's own calculations, only about half the work force contributes to a pension fund. ''We are aware there is a big hole and that we need to take corrective measures,'' Mr. Larrain said.
 Because many of the claims initially made on behalf of the privatized system proved exaggerated or inaccurate, the transition period has turned out to be longer and more expensive than anticipated. The annual cost to the government, still the guarantor of last resort, has remained steady at 5 to 6 percent of the nation's economic output. (By comparison, in 2003, Social Security outlays in the United States totaled 4.2 percent of the gross domestic product.) 
 Chile spends about $2 billion a year to pay retirees from its armed forces, according to Mr. Scolari. The military imposed privatization on the rest of the country, but was careful to preserve its own advantages and exclude fellow soldiers from the system. Despite calls that the military be forced to give up its exemption, no civilian government has been prepared to pursue that.
 Proponents of the privatized system argue that those costs will diminish in coming years, as those still receiving benefits from the old system gradually die off. But critics disagree, pointing to the large numbers of younger Chileans in the work force who either do not participate or whose contributions will fall short of the amount required for a minimum pension.
 For those remaining in the government's original pay-as-you-go system, the maximum retirement benefit is now about $1,250 a month. The National Center for Alternative Development Studies, a research institute here, calculates that to get that same amount from a private pension fund, workers would have to contribute more than $250,000 over their careers, a target that has been reached by fewer than 500 of the private system's 7 million past and present contributors.
 This leaves many Chileans in a situation that has led to the coining of a phrase: ''pension damage.'' There is now even an Association of People With Pension Damage, 157,000 members and growing, that consists of Chileans, mostly former government employees, who find that their pensions, based on contributions to the private system, are significantly less than if they had remained in the old system.
 ''They come to us in desperation,'' said Yasmir Farina, the group's president, ''because those who stayed in the government system are often retiring with monthly pensions twice as large as everyone else's.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Jan. 27 about the Chilean retirement program -- which President Bush has cited as a model for his plans to overhaul Social Security -- misspelled the surname of the minister of labor and social security, who discussed flaws in the system. He is Ricardo Solari, not Scolari.

HEADLINE: What happened when two rich countries liberalized trade? Pain, and then gain.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel (www.dynamist.com) is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness,'' just published in paperback by Perennial.

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS argue for free trade. They have two centuries of theory and experience to back them up. And they have recent empirical studies of how the liberalization of trade has increased productivity in less-developed countries like Chile and India. Lowering trade barriers, they maintain, not only cuts costs for consumers but aids economic growth and makes the general public better off.
 Even so, free trade is a tough sell. ''The truth of the matter is that we have one heck of a time explaining these benefits to the larger public, a public gripped by free trade fatigue,'' the economist Daniel Trefler wrote in an article last fall in The American Economic Review. 
 One problem, he argued, is that there is not enough research on how free trade affects industrialized countries like the United States and Canada. Another is that research tends to concentrate on either long-term benefits or on short-term costs, instead of looking at both. 
 ''We talk a lot about the benefits of free trade agreements, but when it comes to academics studying it, we know next to nothing in terms of hard-core facts about what happens when two rich countries liberalize trade,'' Professor Trefler, of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, said in an interview.
 His article, ''The Long and Short of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement,'' uses detailed data on both Canadian industries and individual companies to address these gaps. (The paper is on his Web site at http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/trefler/) The study looks at the effect of tariff reductions, the simplest kind of liberalization. 
 Tariffs are usually not considered that significant in developed countries, where many major industries compete without such protection. But, Professor Trefler said, ''they're not significant except where they matter.'' 
 Before the agreement went into effect in 1989, more than one in four Canadian industries were, in fact, protected by tariffs of more than 10 percent. Those industries included not only businesses known for their protectionism, notably apparel makers, but manufacturers of a wide range of products, from beer and pretzels to coffins, plastic pipes and paper bags. 
 Before the agreement, imports from the United States faced an average tariff of 8.1 percent and an effective tariff of 16 percent. The effective rate included import taxes on the final product and tariffs paid on raw materials. Someone importing a chair could face a direct tariff on furniture, for example, but could also pay indirect tariffs on wood and upholstery fabric. 
 Not surprisingly, the Canadian industries that had relied on tariffs to protect them ''were hammered'' when those barriers disappeared, Professor Trefler said. ''They saw their employment fall by 12 percent,'' he said, meaning one in eight workers lost their jobs. In manufacturing as a whole, the trade agreement reduced employment by 5 percent. 
 ''Employment losses of 5 percent translate into 100,000 lost jobs and strike me as large,'' he wrote, ''not least because only a relatively small number of industries experienced deep tariff concessions.'' 
 No wonder free trade agreements touch off so much opposition. 
 As painful as those layoffs were, however, the job losses were a short-term effect. Over the long run, employment in Canada did not drop, and manufacturing employment remains more robust than in other industrialized countries. 
 ''Within 10 years, the lost employment was made up by employment gains in other parts of manufacturing,'' Professor Trefler found. 
 While low-productivity plants shut down, high-productivity Canadian manufacturers not only expanded into the United States but further improved their operations. Along the way, they hired enough new workers to make up for losses elsewhere. 
 ''The average effect of the U.S. tariff cuts on Canadian employment was thus a wash: the employment losses by less-productive firms offset the employment gains by more productive firms,'' Professor Trefler wrote in an e-mail message, citing further research. 
 Nor, contrary to predictions, did Canadian wages drop because of competition from less-educated, nonunionized workers in the southern United States. Quite the opposite: using payroll statistics, he found that ''for all workers, the tariff concessions raised annual earnings'' by about 3 percent over eight years. 
 Admittedly, that is not a lot. ''A 3 percent rise in earnings spread over eight years will buy you more than a cup of coffee, but not at Starbucks,'' he wrote. ''The important finding is not that earnings went up, but that earnings did not go down.'' In addition, he said, ''there is absolutely no evidence'' that the trade agreement worsened income inequality. 
 The big story is that lowering tariffs set off a productivity boom. 
 Formerly sheltered Canadian companies began to compete with and compare themselves with more-efficient American businesses. Some went under, but others significantly improved operations. 
 The productivity gains were huge. In the formerly sheltered industries most affected by the tariff cuts, labor productivity jumped 15 percent, at least half from closing inefficient plants. ''This translates into an enormous compound annual growth rate of 1.9 percent,'' he wrote. 
 But closing plants is not the whole story, or even half of it. Among export-oriented industries, which expanded after the agreement, data from individual plants show an increase in labor productivity of 14 percent. Manufacturing productivity as a whole jumped 6 percent. 
 ''The idea that a simple government policy could raise productivity so dramatically is to me truly remarkable,'' Professor Trefler said. 
 And the long-run increase in productivity did not result mostly from shutting down inefficient plants. It came from better operating practices. 
 ''That's not coming from natural selection,'' he said. ''That firm's actually doing business differently.'' 
 Thanks in part to the trade agreement, he sees a shift in attitudes among the younger generation of Canadian managers. They are less content to be the best in Canada's relatively small market. 
 ''They're thinking the competition isn't here in Toronto,'' he said. ''The competition is there in the U.S. To succeed in U.S. markets, you have to play like the Americans do, which is innovate and upgrade.''

HEADLINE: What the IPods Are Wearing These Days

BYLINE: By Rachel Metz

 BODY:
FOR the iPod, perhaps the toy with the most toys, a couple in Sydney, Australia, want you to consider one more accessory: a sort of sleeping bag, better known as the foofpod.
 While silicone skins and stretchy cases are common remedies for those seeking iPod protection, Fiona Bury and Shane Wynter offer a softer solution at foofpod.com, which began taking orders in August.
 Foofpods, which cost $12, come in an array of colors and fabrics, like herringbone Irish tweed, spotted black-and-white fake fur and blue or hot pink corduroy. They're open at the top, but users say they keep their iPods snug and offer some protection. 
 The product -- foof is a palindromic duplication of Ms. Bury's nickname, Fo -- was a result of the pair's move to Sydney from Dublin last summer (Ms. Bury is Irish; Mr. Wynter is Australian). They had been making larger bags to hold Apple laptops since June, selling them at foofbag.com.
 The initial product was Mr. Wynter's idea. He, the author of a Mac trouble-shooting book, and she, an unemployed real estate investment worker, hoped it would earn them some much-needed money.
 ''I kept saying to Fiona, 'This would take off if we just put it together, started selling it on the Internet,''' Mr. Wynter said.
 Ms. Bury started making foofbags on her mother's vintage black Singer sewing machine, though her only prior sewing project produced a too-big pair of overalls.
 And when preparing to move to Sydney soon after, the couple realized they had a lot of fabric scraps they didn't want to take. So, they started making smaller bags, which they called foofpods.
 Now, they're making both.
 ''It's a lot more attractive than iPod cases I see many of my classmates running around with,'' Toshi Clark, 23, a University of Washington medical student, said of his foofpod.
 Most of Ms. Bury and Mr. Wynter's orders come from the United States, despite the shipping charges, which start at $7.50, and the wait. One sign of success is that Mr. Wynter recently noticed a competitor's Web site selling knockoffs. ''We thought, imitation is the highest form of flattery,'' Ms. Bury said. Rachel Metz

HEADLINE: A Growing China Becomes Japan's Top Trade Partner

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
China surpassed the United States as Japan's top trading partner for the first time last year, highlighting the growing economic ties between Japan and its rapidly expanding neighbor. 
 China, including Hong Kong, accounted for 20.1 percent of Japan's total foreign trade last year, compared with an 18.6 percent share for the United States, according to figures released Wednesday by Japan's Ministry of Finance. By value, Japan's trade with China and Hong Kong, including exports and imports, rose to a record high 22.20 trillion yen ($215 billion) in 2004, outstripping the 20.48 trillion yen in trade with its longtime top partner, the United States.
 The increase in Japan's trade with China has been driven in part by China's surging growth, but even more, economists say, by the expanding use of China as a production base for Japanese cars, computers and electronic gadgets that are then shipped around the world. While the trade figures show Japan's economic well-being is increasingly linked to China, that has not diminished the importance of the United States, economists say. 
 ''China has become a major production base for foreign companies including Japanese,'' said Peter Morgan, economist at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. ''But if one looks at the final destination of the products, the U.S. is clearly more important still.'' Mr. Morgan calculated that about 60 percent of Japanese exports to China are tied to products bound elsewhere. 
 For years, companies like Matsushita Electric Industrial have been shipping computer chips and other core components to factories in China where they are slotted into televisions, DVD players and cellphones to be sold in other markets. And now Japanese companies are using factories in China for even more sophisticated production. By 2007, the Honda Motor Company, for example, plans to nearly double its exports of motorcycles from China to about 300,000, from 170,000 last year. And later this year, the company plans to start exporting a hatchback called Jazz from China to showrooms in Europe. 
 ''The shift in production from Japan to China has been conducted in stages. It started with the low-end stuff, then moved into machinery and obviously autos are the next stage,'' said Ryo Hino, an economist in Tokyo for J.P. Morgan. ''Japan is doing the rational thing by attaching itself to a high-growth developing economy.''
 To be sure, the United States is still the largest single foreign market for Japanese goods -- Japan's overall trade with China was higher than with the United States only because Japan imports much more from China than from the United States. That also means that Japan has a much larger trade surplus with the United States, at 6.96 trillion yen ($67.56 billion) last year, than with China, at 1.46 trillion yen.
 Still, China is where the action is for Japan in terms of export growth. Japan's exports to China, including Hong Kong, increased 21 percent last year, to 11.83 trillion yen, while Japan's exports to the United States rose just 2.3 percent, to 13.72 trillion yen. Over all, China accounted for a quarter of Japan's export growth last year, making it very important to a country whose two-year-old recovery has been built largely on exports. 
 The crucial question for Japan now is how long China's appetite for imports will last. China reported earlier this week that its economy expanded at a fevered 9.5 percent in the fourth quarter, even as inflation seemed to be abating. 
 Despite that growth, Japan's exports to China seem to have cooled somewhat. Growth of Japan's exports to China slowed to 9 percent in December, compared with a year earlier, from 22 percent in November. 
 In December, Japan's overall trade surplus expanded at a modest pace of 1.8 percent from a year earlier, to 1.14 trillion yen ($11.06 billion), on an increase in shipments of autos and steel, while imports grew 10.9 percent, mainly because of rising oil prices.

To the Editor:
 David Brooks is right to raise the alarm about declining social mobility (''The Sticky Ladder,'' column, Jan. 25). 
 True, American college enrollments have boomed since World War II. In 1940, about 5 percent of the population held college degrees, compared with more than 25 percent today. But while this greater access to education has opened pathways to the middle class for millions of Americans, it has also created new inequalities. 
 As racial and economic segregation has declined, educational segregation has grown. Today, college graduates concentrate in a few places, while huge swaths of the country's interior and dozens of urban neighborhoods suffer a brain drain.
 The result is what Mr. Brooks aptly calls a ''hereditary meritocratic class'': Kids who grow up in neighborhoods filled with college graduates -- and good schools -- start life with a leg up; those raised in places abandoned by college graduates are at a disadvantage.

 In reminding us of Abraham Lincoln's belief in the importance of social mobility, David Brooks could have also quoted a line from Lincoln's 1864 appearance before the Workingmen's Association of New York: ''That some should be rich shows that others may become rich, and, hence, is just encouragement to industry and enterprise.''
 How pertinent are those words -- not only because they are fair but also because of the need for the economic growth and innovation that benefit all Americans.

 Here's one way to halt the erosion of social mobility: Raise taxes for those of us making at least $150,000 (the median income of Harvard parents, as Mr. Brooks points out). Then, less privileged teenagers can go to college on government grants, more underprivileged toddlers can go to Head Start and public school teachers can earn enough to make the profession attractive again.
 Next, strengthen the estate tax, as both a revenue source and a social leveler -- so that my grandchildren's advantages will spring from their abilities, not their trust funds.

HEADLINE: WorldCom Complexity an Issue at Trial

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Prosecutors in the trial of Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, called their first witnesses yesterday in federal court in Manhattan and peppered them with questions about accounting and the telecommunications industry.
 The questioning and cross-examination of Douglas Webster, an executive at MCI, and Adam Quinton, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, offered a glimpse of the tactics the prosecution and defense will probably use. In short, prosecutors tried to simplify WorldCom's business while the defense highlighted its complexity.
 The government has accused Mr. Ebbers of being the architect of an $11 billion accounting fraud at WorldCom, which in 2002 became the largest corporate failure in America. He faces charges of conspiracy, securities fraud and filing false statements to securities regulators. 
 Lawyers for Mr. Ebbers said that he had been misled by subordinates.
 In questioning Mr. Webster, who worked for WorldCom when MCI acquired it in 1998, prosecutors reduced the telecommunications network to a series of multicolor slides and digestible descriptions. 
 For about three hours yesterday, prosecutors asked Mr. Quinton, who followed WorldCom for several years, to define everything from a company to a balance sheet.
 By contrast, the defense tried to illustrate the complexity of financial markets and the telecommunications industry. The lawyer for Mr. Ebbers, Reid Weingarten, repeatedly asked Mr. Quinton about the imprecision of trying to forecast the performance of a company and its stock, referring to Mr. Quinton's reports on WorldCom for emphasis.
 Mr. Weingarten then continued with a theme he laid out in his opening arguments Tuesday: That Mr. Ebbers was incapable of following the intricacies of his company's accounting and that he relied on others to take care of it, including most prominently Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's chief financial officer.
 Mr. Weingarten produced two tape recordings of conference calls between WorldCom executives and industry analysts, including Mr. Quinton. On one call on Oct. 25, 2001, Mr. Quinton asked Mr. Ebbers two questions about the impact of wireless technology on WorldCom and the company's forecasts.
 Mr. Ebbers responded, ''those sound like all Scott questions to me, Adam.'' Mr. Sullivan then proceeded to answer in detail.
 In the second call on Feb. 7, 2002, Mr. Quinton again asked Mr. Ebbers two questions. Mr. Ebbers told another executive, Ron Beaumont, to answer the first one. In response to the second question about when he thought the economy would recover, Mr. Ebbers replied, ''Remember I'm a P.E. graduate, not an economist.''
 Mr. Ebbers graduated from Mississippi College with a major in physical education.
 The strategies the two sides have taken are frequently deployed in accounting fraud cases, according to lawyers who have tried white-collar criminal cases. The prosecution tries to show that the elements of the fraud are easy to follow and could not have been missed by professionals employed to lead their company.
 At the same time, defense lawyers try to show how inexact the business is and that even the most talented executives and industry specialists make mistakes and have trouble making accurate forecasts.
 ''The prosecution is going to say that this is obvious stuff,'' said Andrew M. Edison, a partner at Bracewell & Patterson in Houston who has tried securities fraud cases. ''You'd clearly expect the defense to make this a complicated case and that this is not as simple as it looks.''
 Mr. Edison expects the defense ''to continue hammering away at this'' throughout the trial, regardless of the witness.
 But the ultimate question is whether jurors believe that Mr. Ebbers, as founder and chief executive of WorldCom, should be held responsible for a fraud committed by his subordinates, and whether he took an active role in it.
 In establishing their case, prosecutors asked Mr. Webster, the MCI executive, about the dynamics in the telecommunications industry in the 1990's and into 2002. 
 From 1998 to 2000, Mr. Webster said there was ''a lot of money coming in'' because of strong demand from Internet and other companies.
 But when the Internet boom went bust in 2000, revenue plunged and bad debts rose. WorldCom's costs, though, fell far more slowly. To make matters worse, the company had spent billions of dollars buying and building networks to handle what it thought would be continued strong demand. 
 Mr. Webster said employees at WorldCom referred to a well-known line from the movie ''Field of Dreams'' to describe their strategy: ''If you build it, they will come.''
 In the movie, an Iowa farmer played by Kevin Costner builds a baseball field on his farm hoping that players will come to play.
 ''A lot of companies like WorldCom built the networks,'' Mr. Webster said, ''but nobody came.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Power Hopes to Find a Welcome Mat Again

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: PORT GIBSON, Miss., Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Facing the possibility that a utility company would try to build a new nuclear reactor here, the City of Port Gibson and surrounding Claiborne County moved swiftly last month to protect the interests of their residents.
 ''We're willing to do whatever it takes to do to make this happen,'' said Amelda J. Arnold, the city's mayor. Last month, city aldermen voted unanimously to urge the Entergy Corporation, which already operates one reactor here, to build a second. The County Board of Supervisors did the same. 
 The posture here is starkly different from that in New York, where town and county governments are trying to close two Entergy reactors at Indian Point in Westchester County. Around the country, supporters and opponents of nuclear power are newly energized because the economics for new reactors is no longer so unfavorable. With the nation's 103 power reactors turning into antiques -- the newest design in service was ordered in 1973 -- some utilities want to replace theirs. 
 In three places, nuclear plant operators have applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for ''early site approval,'' which would give them permission to build on particular sites anytime in the next 20 years. 
 The furthest along in that process is Dominion Power, at North Anna, Va., about 40 miles northwest of Richmond, where it already operates two reactors. But Exelon, the nation's largest nuclear operator, is not far behind with an application to build an additional reactor at its site in Clinton, Ill.
 Entergy has mapped out a spot here, 25 miles south of Vicksburg, adjacent to the company's 20-year-old Grand Gulf reactor, near the banks of the Mississippi. Exelon and Entergy are part of a multicompany consortium, called NuStart Energy, that is seeking to prepare a license application for a plant, and Dominion Resources has established a partnership with General Electric for the same purpose, although no company has committed itself so far to ordering a reactor.
 Entergy's proposed site is in a region acutely sensitive to the price of natural gas, which has tripled in price in the last few years. Now it also has public support from local governments looking to create new jobs and more tax revenue. 
 Local support is not enough to induce a company to take the billion-dollar plunge, but it helps. ''You can get a federal license, but ultimately we work and live in these communities,'' Gary J. Taylor, president and chief executive of Entergy Nuclear, said in an interview at the company headquarters in Jackson.
 Mr. Taylor's company expects to spend about $10 million to get early site approval and an additional $7 million on the consortium seeking to develop an application, two steps that he hopes will cut at least three years off the plant-building timetable. 
 At Exelon, John Rowe, the chief executive, said the company might order a new reactor as early as 2010. Older plants face retirement, natural gas is expensive, and at some point, concern over climate change will give nuclear power an edge, he said; one way would be for the government to give tax credits to reactor operators as it does to windmill operators.
 ''My company, as long as I run it, will never make a decision except on the hard-boiled economics,'' Mr. Rowe said in a telephone interview. ''But we believe, and, praise the Lord, the president of the United States believes, if we want to have a lower carbon future, a new generation of nuclear plants will be an essential part of that.'' 
 In Port Gibson, people cite many advantages and many disadvantages to nuclear power, but they do not mention global warming. James E. Miller, the county administrator, said the county taxes on a $150,000 house here were $50 a year, compared with $500 to $800 in surrounding counties, because of tax revenues from Entergy. But the unemployment rate is still in the double digits, Mr. Miller said, and a new plant would bring jobs to the county. 
 Whether attitudes here are typical of the rest of the country is an open question, but a decision to build will not require a national consensus. Here most reactions run from enthusiastic to ambivalent acceptance.
 ''I helped build Grand Gulf and I feel that it is safe,'' said Edward Carter, 48, a former ironworker who now coordinates an annual music festival for the county. A new plant would mean jobs, tax revenues and a steady stream of visitors to this out-of-the-way town, he said. ''I understand that it would be a prototype, so people from all over the world would come to see it,'' Mr. Carter said.
 Patricia Crosby, director of Mississippi Cultural Crossroads, a storefront arts agency on Port Gibson's faded main street, said of the possibility of a new reactor, ''It's not my cup of tea, but there are certain realities here.'' Her organization gets $12,000 a year in financing from the county, support that would be impossible without the nuclear plant, she said. County officials refer to the elementary, middle and high schools as ''100 percent schools,'' which means every child gets a free lunch. 
 Mayor Arnold said Entergy had ''pretty much adopted all three schools.'' At least 100 local residents are among the company's more than 700 employees, and Entergy pays about $680,000 a year in city taxes, more than a third of the budget. ''I want to build a police station, a fire station, I want two new fire trucks, five new police cars, and an overhaul of the water pipes,'' Ms. Arnold said. 
 Not everyone is sold on the idea of a new plant. Eric Torrey, 23, a senior at Alcorn State University near here, looked up from his turnip greens at the Grant's Place restaurant and weighed the added annual tax revenue to the city, perhaps another $600,000, against the possibility of a nuclear accident. ''If it does happen, it's not going to be worth the $600,000,'' Mr. Torrey said. 
 ''It would put us on the terrorist map,'' he added. 
 Outsiders think the time may be coming for a new plant somewhere. ''The industry wants to do it,'' said David Chisel, a senior consultant at Synapse Energy Economics, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., that has done work for many clients who oppose nuclear energy. ''The government is giving them some subsidies towards studying it. The N.R.C. probably wants to issue the licenses. And with high natural gas prices, they've got an incentive.'' 
 In Washington, antinuclear groups tried to enter the licensing hearings at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission so they could present the argument that building another reactor in Claiborne County, which is about 85 percent African-American, was an example of ''environmental racism,'' putting undesirable facilities in poor, minority towns. But the mayor, the county supervisor and the Entergy vice president at Grand Gulf, all African-American, rejected that idea. 
 Along with residents here, another group wants a new reactor: people who have dedicated decades of their professional lives to a field that now threatens to become irrelevant. A new plant order would be vindication for them. 
 ''There's a lot of talk now that within the next 10 years, someone's going to do it,'' said George A. Williams, the Entergy vice president assigned to Grand Gulf. ''And I'd love it to be here.'' But for the experience of the last 30 years to be directly helpful to a new generation of plants, the order would have to come soon.
 ''The talent is starting to get a little gray,'' Mr. Williams said.

HEADLINE: Charges Raise Questions About Mexico's Adherence to Securities Laws

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
A common expression in Mexico, ''poor businesses, rich businessmen,'' has proved all too true over the last decade, as fraud and mismanagement created a string of corporate scandals, including a banking crisis that has cost the government $100 billion. But that was supposed to change as the government adopted new regulations over the last few years aimed at shining a light on corporate finances and holding executives in check.
 Then came the fraud charges filed this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Ricardo Salinas Pliego, one of Mexico's brashest businessmen, who is the chairman of TV Azteca in Mexico. One of the counts against Mr. Salinas Pliego and TV Azteca's former chief executive, Pedro Padilla Longoria, is believed to be the first filed against corporate officers of a company outside the United States under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, said John Nester, an S.E.C. spokesman. 
 The fact that the charges were filed by the S.E.C. raised new questions about just how committed Mexican regulators were to enforcing the securities laws. The charges also served as a reminder to Mexican companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange that raising money from foreign investors comes with strings attached. 
 Indeed, as Mexico's top companies have sought financing abroad in recent years, most have opened their books and outlined their strategies. 
 A securities law approved in 2001 sharply strengthened the rights of minority shareholders, requiring that they receive the same price for their shares when companies are sold. Companies in Mexico are often controlled by a single family, and before 2001 family members could receive a higher price than minority shareholders. 
 The law also required that a quarter of board members be independent and that boards have an audit committee with a majority of independent directors. The government is completing the draft of a tougher new securities law, which it expects to send to Congress by March. 
 But critics say most companies have yet to appoint vigorous independent board members. 
 ''We don't have a translation for the word 'accountability,''' said Adalberto Palma, a corporate governance consultant. The charges against Mr. Salinas Pliego, he said, ''may make the case that transparency and accountability are a must for business and government.''
 Underlying the reluctance to embrace corporate governance is an attitude dating back to Mexico's recent authoritarian past. Patriarchs who built business empires have long acted as if they knew best how to run their businesses and bristled at the notion of answering to investors or being subject to oversight from outside board members. 
 Mexico's corporate empires continue to be family-run, with the majority shareholder serving as chairman and often chief executive. Many of these empires are complex tangles of listed and unlisted holding companies and subsidiaries that do business with one another. Such structures make it possible for executives to hide deals among the businesses.
 As a result, the corporate scandals in Mexico have usually involved insider deals. Audits of the banks that collapsed after the 1995 banking crisis, for example, found that bank owners routinely made loans to their own companies or firms owned by friends without any oversight. 
 ''There is a bit of an attitude that 'I know more because I did all this and you, independent director, how can you know my business?''' said Jorge Fabre, director of the Center for Excellence in Corporate Governance. 
 Among Mexico's close-knit business elite, ostensibly independent board members may have links to controlling shareholders that are not obvious from their thumbnail biography in the annual report. ''The intermingling of Mexican society is very complicated,'' Mr. Palma said. ''Corporate governance touches the power structure of the country as a whole.''
 But the worst offender in Mexico, Mr. Palma said, is the government, where agencies and state companies, like the oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, are run by boards accountable to no one. ''Mexican public institutions have to look at themselves in the mirror,'' he said. 
 The National Banking and Securities Commission, known by its Spanish initials CNBV, cooperated with the S.E.C. in its investigation into Mr. Salinas Pliego and two of his top executives. Mr. Salinas Pliego has acknowledged that he bought discounted debt that was owed by a cellphone subsidiary of TV Azteca, Unefon, and made a profit of $109 million when Unefon repaid the debt at its full value.
 The S.E.C. complaint says that Mr. Salinas Pliego and his executives ''engaged in an elaborate scheme to conceal Salinas's role'' in the debt deal. 
 In a statement in response, Mr. Salinas Pliego, who is not related to former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, said, ''The transactions discussed in the S.E.C. press release benefited Unefon, TV Azteca and their shareholders, and I stand behind them.'' He went on to complain that the S.E.C. charges were ''false, in bad faith and discriminatory.'' 
 Since the S.E.C. is also seeking court orders barring Mr. Salinas Pliego and Mr. Padilla from serving as officers or directors of any publicly held company with securities trading in the United States, some analysts say that Mr. Salinas Pliego may seek to delist TV Azteca from the New York Stock Exchange.
 Over the last few months, Mr. Salinas Pliego has taken steps to reduce his exposure to the United States by borrowing in Mexico to pay off international bonds. In December, TV Azteca paid off a $300 million bond issue with $176 million raised on the local Mexican market and $124 million from a $300 million credit line from Banco Inbursa, the bank controlled by Carlos Slim, Latin America's richest man. 
 Still, Mr. Salinas Pliego is unlikely to retreat completely into Mexico. He has been building a Spanish-language television network in the United States to broadcast TV Azteca programming.
 The CNBV's investigation is reaching its final stage. The commission is notifying all those involved in the Unefon debt deal that they appear to have violated stock market rules but still have another chance to defend themselves in front of the commission, a spokesman said. 
 ''I think it is too bad that the S.E.C. acted first,'' said Andres Rozental, a specialist on corporate governance issues. ''I would have preferred it if Mexican authorities had been first. Now it will appear as a reaction to the S.E.C.'' 
 Denise Dresser, a Mexican political scientist, wrote in the Mexico City daily newspaper Reforma last week that, ''The United States government will try a businessman for covering up and lying, and the Mexican authorities should not think that is a small thing. Because it is not. What's at stake are the transparency of economic transactions, the integrity of financial markets and the rights of those who do not even know they have rights.''
 Critics of the commission say that it has been too timid to take on powerful Mexican companies. 
 The commission has done little to help its reputation. Last November, its president, Jonathan Davis, said in a speech that the CNBV had punished six companies and 19 individuals for securities violations including insider trading and stock price manipulation in the preceding year. The commission said it would release details of those cases.
 The bill the government expects to send Congress would strengthen and clarify the role of corporate boards. 
 The law, if approved, would allow companies to set up a separate corporate governance committee in addition to the existing audit committee. Only independent directors would serve on both committees, to eliminate the conflict of interest that occurs when outside accountants report to the chief executive who hired them, said Jorge Familiar, a former CNBV official who helped write the legislation and is credited by corporate governance advocates as having pushed the issue forward. 
 The legislation would also extend existing laws on financial disclosure and corporate governance to all the companies controlled by a holding group, not just those that are publicly listed. Transactions among these companies would have to be analyzed by independent board members.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Budget Mixes Solid Numbers With Hope

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected today to unveil a preliminary budget for the fiscal year beginning in July that will likely rely on higher-than-expected tax revenues, and a far-from-certain infusion of state and federal aid, to help close a deficit of about $1.5 billion.
 The mayor has signaled in recent months that he does not intend to raise taxes, impose major service reductions or resort to layoffs to balance the city's $50 billion budget, leaving himself few options. And with this being an election year, he very much wants to offer homeowners another round of $400 property tax rebates, which is expected to cost the city $250 million.
 Making all that a little easier are optimistic revisions of city tax collections for this fiscal year, including a new estimate from the City Council this week that shows the city collecting $567 million more than what the Bloomberg administration projected last October. 
 The increase in tax revenue is broad-based, with business income taxes, real estate transfer taxes, and personal income taxes running ahead of projections by $170 million, $161 million and $155 million, respectively, the Council report said.
 ''The economy appears to be recovering, and revenues were quite robust in the fall,'' said Larian Angelo, the Council's finance director. ''It was encouraging that they were robust across all the tax categories.''
 Yesterday, during a question-and-answer session with reporters on Staten Island, Mr. Bloomberg kept details of his budget presentation close to the vest. But he said it would be ''a reasonably optimistic message'' that emphasizes the positive effect on the budget of reducing crime, improving schools and making the city generally more livable.
 ''That increases your tax base,'' he said, ''and I will show how that has had an effect on the city.''
 For all the sunny prospects of more tax revenue, Mr. Bloomberg's expectation of close to $1 billion in additional state and federal assistance is less likely to materialize, according to fiscal analysts. A glimpse of the difficulty he will have getting what he wants came in Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed state budget, which contained a far smaller amount of money than the mayor had sought.
 About half of the roughly $900 million Mr. Pataki earmarked for New York City, for example, is not direct aid, but would come in the form of projected savings from changes to Medicaid reimbursements. Those changes are a double-edged benefit to the city, since, by some estimates, they would also cost the city $200 million in unreimbursed Medicaid expenses incurred by city-run hospitals.
 The governor did not also include the $1.4 billion that a court-appointed panel determined the city needed to add to its education budget next year, to begin addressing the chronic underfinancing of city schools asserted in a lawsuit brought by a group called Campaign for Fiscal Equity.
 The pressure for additional school financing, coupled with expired labor agreements with some of the city's largest unions that kept personnel costs unusually low last year, are ''two huge wild cards'' that could add millions to next year's budget, said Douglas Turetsky, a spokesman for the city's Independent Budget Office.
 For budgeting purposes, the mayor has been assuming that the contract terms agreed to last year by District Council 37, the largest municipal union, would eventually apply to all unionized workers. But other big unions are holding out for more generous agreements, which, if agreed to by the mayor or imposed by an arbitrator, could put further pressure on the budget.
 ''It's unlikely that the teachers, and police and firefighters, will agree on the same terms as D.C. 37,'' Mr. Turetsky said.

HEADLINE: A Sinking U.S. Dollar Dominates the Debate at Davos

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
Two things were as clear as the Alpine air on the opening day of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday: The relentlessly sinking dollar is Topic A, and anyone hoping for an answer to when it will stop dropping is likely to come away disappointed.
 Economists, politicians and business executives voiced deep unease about the imbalances in the global financial system, which are reflected in the dollar's steep fall against the euro and other currencies.
 But most expressed skepticism that the Bush administration would reduce the trade and budget deficits, which have fed those imbalances. The White House has said that it does not view these issues as a major problem because foreigners still view the American economy as an attractive investment. 
 Some at the forum said they doubted that China, which is financing much of the American debt, would bow to pressure to allow its currency to rise against the dollar this year.
 ''The U.S. current-account deficit is a problem for the whole world,'' said Jacob A. Frenkel, a former governor of the Bank of Israel. But, he said, ''I don't see the budget deficit being taken seriously.''
 The Bush administration, which dispatched Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to past Davos meetings to defend the Iraq war and other foreign policy actions, has not sent a similarly prominent economic policy maker to this gathering. That absence has lent the proceedings an imbalanced tone.
 ''In fairness, it's a transition period in Washington,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who supplied the American voice on a panel about American leadership. He added, however, ''The administration doesn't really have anyone they trust enough to send here.''
 Mr. Frank, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said that he worried that the United States was not paying enough attention to the risks of its growing indebtedness. The repercussions of a weak dollar, he said, had barely registered with the White House.
 Other critics were blunter. 
 ''There's nobody home on economic policy in America right now,'' said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley. The twin burdens of household and public debt in the United States, he said, are unsustainable. Describing American consumers as ''an accident waiting to happen,'' he asked, ''When does the music stop?''
 With the dollar already trading at $1.30 to the euro -- near the level of economic unacceptability for Europe -- Mr. Roach said the United States could not rely on currency markets to right the imbalance between it and the Asian countries that finance American deficits by buying Treasury bills.
 The answer, he said, lies with the Federal Reserve, which he said would have to raise rates aggressively to curb the spending binge. Whether it could do that without triggering a recession is an open question.
 Few here held out hope for international coordination of the kind that stabilized the dollar in the 1980's. 
 ''The Bush administration doesn't listen to people,'' said Laura D. Tyson, who served as an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton. ''There's no hope of changing U.S. fiscal policy.''
 Professor Tyson, who is dean of the London Business School, said European leaders needed to stop worrying about the actions of other countries and set about streamlining their own economies. She pointed to recent wage negotiations in Germany, in which the unions agreed to longer hours and more flexible work rules, as a hopeful sign of change.
 Certainly, Europe cannot rely on Asia to take the pressure off the euro. While people here said they were guardedly optimistic that China would eventually allow its currency, the yuan, to rise against the dollar, few were willing to hazard a guess as to when -- or to what extent.
 ''That will need a political commitment and a political will, and I don't see that happening this year,'' said Takatoshi Ito, a specialist in international economics at the University of Tokyo.
 Some economists warned that the expanding trade deficit and weak dollar could cast a shadow over negotiations to liberalize world trade, which have been dragging for various reasons in the last year.
 China's record trade surplus with the United States could fuel protectionist forces in the United States, said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. He said he could foresee moves to impose import barriers on Chinese wood and shrimp. ''This is a poisonous environment for trade policy and for domestic politics in the United States.''
 In the last couple of years, with the White House's march to war in Iraq, Davos itself has been a rather poisonous environment for Americans. Those tensions have ebbed this year.

HEADLINE: Climate Debate Threatens A Republican Clean-Air Bill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
The Congressional battle over how to reduce air pollution from power plants began anew on Wednesday with consideration of the approach most favored by the White House.
 But after three hours of testimony on that initiative, the Clear Skies Act of 2005, it was obvious that nothing had diminished the concerns that scuttled an earlier version of the legislation. Indeed, one co-sponsor conceded that without major compromises, the new bill was most likely doomed.
 ''If everybody's hunkered down, it's the same old story we've had for the last five or six years,'' said the lawmaker, Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio. ''Then it's goodbye.'' 
 The effort to pass the Clear Skies Act as an amendment to the Clean Air Act is being led by Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who reintroduced it with Mr. Voinovich on Monday.
 The measure sets limits on three major pollutants that affect human health -- sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and, for the first time, mercury -- but not on carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that scientists say contributes to global warming.
 Mr. Inhofe, mindful of the costly technology needed for industry to control emissions, has made no secret of his opposition to carbon dioxide caps, calling global warming ''the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.''
 But supporters of capping carbon dioxide include at least six Republicans, and it was a measure of the intense division between the bill's backers and opponents that Mr. Voinovich concluded Wednesday's hearing by declaring, ''If climate change is part of this legislation, it's going nowhere.''
 The testimony, before the Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change and Nuclear Safety, which Mr. Voinovich leads, reflected the usual fault lines on the Clear Skies Act.
 Industry groups and government officials spoke in favor of it, saying it was the best way to protect jobs, local economies and investments in new power plants while aiming for the 70 percent reductions in three major pollutants that the bill promises by 2018.
 Environmental groups and state environmental regulators opposed it, arguing that Congress should use the opportunity to pass a more muscular bill. They said alternative approaches would not only set carbon dioxide caps but also reduce those three other pollutants at a faster pace and, contrary to the Clear Skies measure, leave in place parts of the Clean Air Act like ''new source review,'' which requires operators to add new pollution controls when plants are upgraded. 
 Two alternatives to the Clear Skies Act are measures co-sponsored by Republicans, including Senator Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island, a member of Mr. Inhofe's committee. Mr. Chafee's preference for his own bill would appear to leave the committee evenly split, 9 to 9, on the Clear Skies legislation, a particular threat to its prospects.
 The Clear Skies Act is modeled on a program adopted in 1990 to reduce acid rain. In setting limits on the emission of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury, it would allow companies whose emissions are lower than the caps to sell credits to those whose emissions are above it. It seeks to bring most of the nation's counties into compliance with air quality standards by 2018; currently, almost half of all Americans live in areas not in compliance.
 The bills competing with it propose tighter caps in a shorter period. They also retain new source review, which supporters of the Clear Skies Act contend threatens plant owners' economic stability because of expensive litigation. Since 1999, the government has brought 15 lawsuits against power companies on grounds of new-source-review violations.
 In testimony Wednesday, Ron Harper, chief executive and general manager of the Basin Electric Power Cooperative, an electrical generation cooperative in nine states, said companies like his were thwarted in planning efforts because of the uncertainties of litigation.
 But Conrad G. Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force, who testified on behalf of four environmental groups, said the other bills -- or even doing nothing -- would be preferable to Clear Skies, which he said would weaken the Clean Air Act, causing unnecessary death and illness.
 ''Our first principle is do no harm,'' Mr. Schneider said. ''Clear Skies guarantees that we will never solve these problems. It offers only half measures with pollution reductions that are too little, too late.''

HEADLINE: Blair Calls on United States to Cooperate With Rest of the World

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
Seeking to bridge deep differences between the United States and other nations, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain urged the Bush administration on Wednesday to heed the concerns of other countries in return for support in its wars on terrorism and tyranny.
 ''If America wants the rest of the world to be part of the agenda it has set, it must be part of their agenda, too,'' Mr. Blair said, appealing for unity in fighting terrorism and poverty. ''It can do so, secure in the knowledge that what people want is not for America to concede but to engage.'' 
 Mr. Blair was speaking at the World Economic Forum at this Swiss ski resort, offering what was billed as a keynote speech on issues that included AIDS and climate control -- matters also addressed by President Jacques Chirac of France in an earlier speech by video hookup from Paris.
 After Mr. Chirac focused on development issues and AIDS, Mr. Blair warned that if global leaders persisted in pursuing separate approaches to key issues like climate control, the world was unlikely to solve its most pressing problems.
 ''The alternative is the international community with competing agendas,'' Mr. Blair said. ''That may help the political art of grandstanding, but it won't present constructive solutions.''
 Mr. Blair referred to President Bush's inaugural address last week, which some in Europe depicted as a harbinger of further intervention in foreign countries under the guise of spreading democracy.
 ''The underlying features of the speech seem to be these,'' Mr. Blair said, acting as he has in the past as an interpreter of American motives to a skeptical Europe. ''America accepts that terrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone. The more people live under democracy, with human liberty intact, the less inclined they or their states will be to indulge terrorism or to engage in it.
 ''By its very nature, such a mission cannot be accomplished alone,'' added Mr. Blair, who has been the closest ally of Mr. Bush in the Iraq war.
 In his speech, Mr. Blair offered ideas that conflicted with White House thinking, particularly on climate control. Much of the world supports the Kyoto Protocol -- a treaty requiring cuts in greenhouse gases linked to global warming -- but the Bush administration does not.
 In an interview after his speech, Mr. Blair said he believed ''the debate is changing in America'' on climate control. ''My desire is to get America back into a dialogue on this issue,'' he said. ''Tackling climate change is going to be a whole lot easier if we have America on board.''
 Mr. Chirac suggested several new ideas to combat the world's woes. One was to tax the money flowing into countries like Switzerland that favor banking secrecy -- an idea that drew a ripple of surprised laughter from the well-heeled delegates to this gathering of 2,225 executives, bankers, politicians and other players in the global economy.
 To raise money for research into vaccine development and other AIDS-related costs, Mr. Chirac suggested that a minuscule levy -- ''a maximum of one ten-thousandth'' -- could be raised from international financial transactions representing $3 trillion a day, enabling international bodies to raise $10 billion a year for the fight against AIDS.

HEADLINE: Bush Portrays Iraq Vote as Step In a Global March to Freedom

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Robin Toner contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
President Bush said Wednesday that the elections this weekend in Iraq would be ''a grand moment in Iraqi history'' that he described as part of a global march toward freedom. Yet he acknowledged that Iraqis themselves had not yet taken the initiative in defending their country and might doubt Washington's will to prevail against the insurgency.
 Mr. Bush's assessment, in the first news conference of his second term, was made on the deadliest day of the war for American forces. 
 ''The story today is going to be very discouraging to the American people,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I understand that. We value life. And we weep and mourn when soldiers lose their life. But it is the long-term objective that is vital, and that is to spread freedom. Otherwise, the Middle East will continue to be a caldron of resentment and hate, a recruiting ground for those who have this vision of the world that is the exact opposite of ours.'' 
 Mr. Bush was peppered with questions about his main domestic priority: revamping the Social Security system to create private accounts. But he declined to be specific about how he would propose to pay for the introduction of the new system, which could cost more than $1 trillion in the next decade. 
 Instead, he focused on making the case for the need to overhaul the system that has been in place for decades, saying, ''if you're a 20-year-old person and you look at the math, you realize that you will inherit a bankrupt system.'' 
 Mr. Bush used much of his hastily called news conference in the White House press room to explain -- but not always to reinforce -- the arguments that he made last Thursday in his Inaugural Address, which appeared to put the United States on an aggressive course of promoting liberty around the world.
 Asked whether that meant he would make advances in personal liberty the main measure of relations with nations like Russia, China or Saudi Arabia, Mr. Bush stopped short of saying he would put the leaders of those nations on notice that freedom would be the main measure of their relationship with Washington.
 ''I don't think foreign policy is an either/or proposition,'' Mr. Bush said in answer to a question about how a country's progress in advancing freedom might be balanced against other American interests, such as securing China's aid in disarming North Korea. ''I think it is possible, when you're a nation like the United States, to be able to achieve both objectives.'' He said, for example, that he would work with China on the ''practical objective'' of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons even while pressing Beijing to allow free speech and democracy to flower.
 When meeting Chinese leaders, he said, ''I will constantly remind them of the benefits of a society that honors their people and respects human rights and human dignity.'' He noted that he had brought up the repression of Tibet and China's efforts to suppress Catholicism, and said that he would remind President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that ''if he intends to continue to look west, we in the West believe in Western values.''
 But Mr. Bush seemed to signal that he would be patient with countries that failed to liberalize quickly. ''There won't be instant democracy,'' he said, adding later, ''That's why I said we're talking about the work of generations.''
 Expanding on his Inaugural Address, Mr. Bush tried several times on Wednesday to place the administration's strategy in Iraq into a broader context, noting that the elections in Iraq on Sunday will follow elections in Ukraine and Afghanistan, and among the Palestinians. 
 He dismissed the criticisms of his Iraq policy leveled by Democrats in Senate proceedings to confirm Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, arguing that the debate in the United States could leave the Iraqi people ''wondering whether or not this nation has the will necessary to stand with them as a democracy evolves.''
 Still, Mr. Bush said ultimate success or failure lay with a new generation of Iraqi leaders. ''Listen, this problem will eventually be solved when the Iraqis take the initiative, and the Iraqi people see Iraqi soldiers willing to defend them,'' he said. ''And so -- and the American people, when they see the Iraqis step up and begin to fight, will see progress being made toward an objective which will make this world a better place.''
 On domestic policy, Mr. Bush said he would work to persuade Congress and the public to follow his lead on Social Security, saying it is worth the political risk, despite growing concern in his own party on Capitol Hill.
 He met later with a group of House Republicans to discuss the issue before Congressional Republicans meet on Friday in West Virginia, where how to proceed on Social Security will be at the top of the agenda. 
 A poll done for House Republicans and distributed Wednesday on Capitol Hill fleshed out the reasons for the jitters among Republicans. It found that voters were increasingly open to making major changes to Social Security, and that younger voters in particular favored personal accounts. 
 But it also found that voters trust Democrats to address the problem more than they trust Republicans, that a majority of voters 55 and older think the policies of the administration and Congressional Republicans have hurt the elderly and that those older voters -- projected to be 40 percent of the electorate in the 2006 midterm elections -- oppose private accounts by a solid majority.
 On Social Security, Mr. Bush did not provide any details of the approach he has in mind. In particular, he did not discuss the likelihood that it would include cuts to the government-paid benefits scheduled under current law. He said he would disclose more about his thinking in the State of the Union address next Wednesday and in appearances around the country afterward. The White House has hedged on whether Mr. Bush will ultimately make a detailed proposal.
 In recent days Democrats have challenged the White House to say whether it agrees with Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, that Congress should consider factors like race and sex in looking at how Social Security operates.
 ''What you're hearing a little bit is whether or not it is worth the political price,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think it is. And I'm looking forward to leading the Congress. And I'm looking forward to taking the case to the American people.''
 After meeting with Mr. Bush late in the afternoon, Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee said that he had made clear to them that he was serious about doing what it takes.
 Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a leading proponent of partial privatization of the system, said, ''He talked about how invested he was in the issue, how important this was to him, to the country.''
 The first phase of the White House's strategy for Social Security has been to convince the nation that there is no choice but to act now, a message the president sought to drive home at his news conference. He used the word ''bankrupt'' three times to describe the condition Social Security would face within decades, and generally portrayed the system as on a course that would leave future retirees in financial danger.
 ''The system will be in the red in 13 years, and in 2042 the system will be broke,'' Mr. Bush said.
 But the severity of the system's financial troubles is open to debate. Social Security takes in more in payroll taxes than it pays out in benefits. In their most recent analysis of the system's condition, the Social Security trustees projected that benefit payments would begin to exceed payroll tax revenues in 2018. For 24 years after that, the system is expected to be able to pay full benefits by drawing on the Social Security trust fund, which is in essence the promise by the government to repay the current excess revenues that are now going to the pot used to cover general government spending.
 After 2042, Social Security could still afford to pay nearly three-quarters of benefits promised by current law. Some economists, especially liberals, say that even after 2042 there is a good chance Social Security could pay full benefits, because the economic assumptions underlying the system's financial projections are extremely conservative.
 Asked if he would consider raising the levels of wages subject to the Social Security payroll tax -- currently $90,000 -- or eliminating the wage ceiling, Mr. Bush appeared to rule out such a change. But his answer was vague enough that it could be interpreted as leaving open the possibility of increasing the wage cap without changing payroll tax rates.
 ''I look forward to a fruitful discussion of all ideas, with the exception of raising the payroll tax,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Poses Tough 'Safety Net' Questions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
If individual investment accounts become an integral part of Social Security, as President Bush is proposing, what will happen to workers who become disabled before they retire?
 Will they be allowed to draw on the savings in their retirement accounts? Will their standard Social Security benefits be increased to make up for the fact that because they have worked fewer years, their personal accounts are likely to be smaller than those of retirees? If they do receive higher benefits, will they have to forfeit their investment savings?
 These are among the dozens of questions posed in a report issued on Wednesday by the National Academy of Social Insurance, a private, nonpartisan organization of academics and government officials who specialize in issues like Social Security, Medicare and unemployment compensation.
 The report takes no position on whether private accounts would be good policy. The 27 panel members who prepared the report after two and a half years of study include strong proponents and strong opponents of Mr. Bush's proposal, as well as some who say they are neutral. 
 But with the political focus on how private accounts would be structured and financed, the panel members worried that these other issues had hardly received any attention. ''These are first-level questions that must be answered,'' said Michael J. Graetz, a co-chairman of the panel, who was an assistant Treasury secretary under the first President George Bush and is now a professor at Yale Law School.
 Among the other issues explored by the panel are these:
 Would the accounts be voluntary or mandatory? If they are voluntary, when would a worker decide whether to participate? Would the decision be irrevocable? 
 Would workers be permitted to cash out their accounts when they retired, or would they have to buy annuities that pay a monthly sum for life? If a new market develops in private annuities, who would regulate it?
 What access would spouses and children have to the savings in private accounts? What happens in the case of divorce?
 All the questions can be answered, Mr. Graetz said at a news conference, but it will require careful study by Congress to answer them right. 
 The core question is how much freedom account holders should have to make financial decisions, said Kenneth S. Apfel, the other co-chairman, who was Social Security commissioner in the Clinton administration and is now on the faculty at the University of Texas. An important corollary question, he said, is, ''Who will help retirees understand the consequences of their choices?''
 The issues involving disability are especially thorny.
 Currently, 16 percent of those receiving monthly Social Security checks are people under retirement age who cannot work because they are disabled. They receive the same benefits, based on their earnings in their working years, that they would receive if they were retired. This is a central element in the safety net provided by Social Security.
 Social Security provides more than half the total income for about half of these disabled people and more than 90 percent of the income for about one-fifth of them. 
 The premise behind almost all proposals to divert tax money into private accounts is that ordinary Social Security benefits would be reduced to save the government money, but theoretically retirees would be at least as well off because income from their private accounts would make up for the lower benefits.
 But this would not work well for people who become disabled. Their accounts would not provide as much income as those of retirees, since they would have had fewer working years to put money into accounts.
 The panel offered several options for dealing with the problem. One would be to give people access to their accounts when they become disabled. Another would be to give disabled workers higher Social Security benefits than retirees but require them to turn over their investment accounts to the government. Another would be to give them higher benefits when they become disabled and then lower the benefits and allow them to tap into their investment accounts when they reach retirement age.
 All the options have advantages and disadvantages, Mr. Apfel said.
 Another series of questions addressed in the report involves new relationships that would have to develop between the federal government and the states. Now, for example, states regulate insurance companies.
 But private accounts would most likely result in a new market for lifetime annuities, financial instruments that guarantee a specific income for life. Without annuities, long-lived retirees could exhaust their savings. The new annuities would doubtless lead to federal regulation and probably federal insurance, but little thought has been given to how this would be structured. 
 Similarly, state laws now define marital property rights. Under Social Security, people who were married for at least 10 years and then divorce are entitled to part of their former spouses' benefits. Without a new federal law, divorced people might not receive any of their spouses' savings in their retirement accounts.
 ''If Congress does not address these issues,'' Mr. Graetz said, ''you will not have uniform national rules.''

HEADLINE: Military Rumblings on Iran

 BODY:
President Bush began his second term with speculation rising about future military moves against Iran. Last week, Vice President Dick Cheney placed Iran first on the list of world trouble spots and darkly hinted that unless tougher measures were taken to curtail its nuclear program, Israel might launch its own pre-emptive airstrikes. Earlier this month, Seymour Hersh reported in The New Yorker that secret reconnaissance operations have already gotten under way inside Iran, as the Pentagon prepares target lists of nuclear sites that could be attacked from the air or by ground-based commando units. 
 Thus far, Mr. Bush has kept his own counsel. But these hawkish rumblings eerily recall the months before the American invasion of Iraq when some of the same officials pressed hardest for military action, while the president remained publicly uncommitted. Given that experience, it would be foolhardy to dismiss the current rhetorical buildup. We hope that this time, wiser heads in the administration will intervene before it is too late. 
 There is no question that Iran has been covertly developing the capacity to build nuclear weapons, and that diplomacy has so far failed to end these efforts. But precipitate American military action would almost certainly do far more harm than good. No major American ally, including Britain, favors such an approach. American planes and missiles alone cannot knock out all of Iran's many secret nuclear sites. 
 An invasion of a country almost three times as populous as Iraq is well beyond the means of America's depleted ground forces. And an American military attack is probably the one thing still able to unite Iran's restive but nationalist population behind the unpopular clerical dictatorship. 
 The most effective leverage available to Washington is international economic sanctions. If American diplomacy can line up traditional European allies, there is a fair chance that the Iranian nuclear program can still be stopped. 
 Iran's nuclear ambitions predate the 1979 Islamic revolution. With crucial help from Pakistan and perhaps other countries, Iran now has centrifuges capable of enriching uranium to weapons grade. It also has considerable supplies of uranium ready to be enriched. Iran has promised not to enrich any of that uranium for now, under the terms of an agreement recently negotiated with Britain, France and Germany, and some experts believe there are still technical hurdles to overcome. Even if it mastered enrichment, Iran would still have to design, build and test a usable weapon. The best guess is that Iran remains at least three to five years from having the bomb. 
 A nuclear-armed Iran is an alarming prospect, given the radical nature of the Iranian regime, with its long and continuing record of sponsoring international terrorism, its undiluted hostility to the United States and Israel, and its intense regional rivalries with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. So effective crisis diplomacy needs to move into high gear.
 The freeze on uranium enrichment that Iran agreed to is only temporary. Its duration depends on the results of talks in which the Europeans are seeking a more definitive renunciation of nuclear enrichment. The Iranians, in return, want economic and trade rewards. 
 Expanded commercial ties with America and Europe are very appealing to Iran's ruling mullahs. Having marginalized the reformist political parties, they now see economic sluggishness and high unemployment as the only remaining threat to their continued grip on power. But the mullahs are unlikely to give up their nuclear weapons efforts, which are popular among Iranians of all political persuasions, unless they are plainly told that refusing will bring punishing economic isolation in the very near future. European leaders have not been willing to send that firm message yet, and need to do so. 
 The next step should be a unified European-American stand that forces Iran to make a clear choice. Either fully renounce its nuclear enrichment programs and win significant trade and economic incentives or fail to do so and suffer severe economic penalties. 
 The Iranian nuclear challenge could not be more dangerous or more pressing. It is time to put aside unilateral American military bluster and European wishful diplomacy and get serious.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Deal in China Faces Scrutiny Over Security Issue

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M.'s plan to sell its personal computer business to Lenovo of China hit a political speed bump yesterday.The chairmen of three House committees urged the Bush administration to conduct a formal investigation of the deal to determine whether it poses a risk to national security.
 In a letter to Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, the Republican committee leaders said they were concerned that the deal could give advanced technology to the Chinese government, and would leave a company controlled by China responsible for handling some United States government contracts.
 The Lenovo Group, the parent company of Lenovo, China's biggest maker of personal computers, is owned mainly by public shareholders. But a government institution, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, holds 37 percent of the shares. If the acquisition is completed, the government's holding will fall below 30 percent, while I.B.M. will take an 18.9 percent stake in the company. 
 ''Given the relationship between so-called private companies in communist states and their government, we believe it is manifestly in the public interest to extend the time for review'' of the planned deal, the letter said.
 The letter was signed by Representative Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the international relations committee; Representative Duncan Hunter, chairman of the armed services committee; and Representative Donald A. Manzullo, chairman of the small business committee.
 The three men also requested a briefing by the administration on the deal's impact on national security, technology licensing and government contracts.
 The appeal by the committee chairmen, trade specialists said, could prompt the administration to conduct an extended investigation of the deal. But they said that after the review, which could last about two months, the administration would almost surely approve the sale.
 ''The administration is not going to ignore some important House committee chairmen, but their concerns don't stand up to scrutiny,'' said William A. Reinsch, a former trade official in the Clinton administration who is president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group that promotes free trade.
 The majority of I.B.M.'s personal computers are already made in China, where the company employs more than 4,000 workers.
 ''I would be stunned if the administration turned this deal down,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a former trade negotiator in the Reagan administration. 
 Foreign purchases of American companies are routinely examined for their possible impact on national security by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency group. 
 The committee includes representatives from the Homeland Security, Justice and Commerce Departments, among others. It is headed by the Treasury secretary. 
 I.B.M. filed its explanation of the transaction with the foreign investment committee at the end of December, three weeks after the announcement of the proposed $1.75 billion sale -- $1.25 billion in cash and stock, and $500 million in debt obligations Lenovo will assume.
 Under the law, the foreign investment committee begins reviewing a proposed sale after it is formally notified. A formal investigation, if deemed necessary, must begin no later than 30 days after it receives notice of a proposed deal, so an investigation would have to start by the end of this month. Any investigation must be completed in 45 days. Then the administration has 15 days to decide whether to challenge a foreign purchase or approve it.
 A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, Molly Miller Wise, said the department ''never comments on matters that may be pending'' before the foreign investment committee.

Purchase Is Approved
By Bloomberg News
 Shareholders of the Lenovo Group, the Chinese computer maker, approved Thursday in Beijing a plan by the company to buy I.B.M.'s PC business.
 As part of the transaction announced Dec. 8, I.B.M. and Lenovo will share the rights to the I.B.M. PC brand for five years and a distribution and sales network in 160 countries. I.B.M. will take an 18.9 percent equity stake in Lenovo, formerly known as the Legend Group.

A Potter's Dream: American Porcelain
 Americans worship success; perhaps they should value glorious failure even more.
 The history of an early-19th-century Philadelphia porcelain company is a case in point. The William Ellis Tucker China Manufactory, one of a handful of early American companies trying to create porcelain equal to that of Europe, produced fine wares for 12 years, from 1826 to 1838. Tucker was the first to produce high-quality porcelain on a commercial scale in America. Against all odds, it succeeded briefly and then failed, largely because of competition from cheaper tariff-free imports.
 Last Friday at the New York Ceramics Fair, Alexandra Kirtley, the assistant curator of American art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, recounted the history of Tucker porcelain in a lecture she gave in conjunction with a show of the porcelain from the museum, which owns about 500 pieces.
 In the early 1800's many Americans were keen to prove their economic independence from England and Europe by making furniture, textiles, even porcelain, at home. Potters had already discovered the raw materials for porcelain -- deposits of kaolin and feldspar -- in Georgia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. The entrepreneurial ones decided that the best way to compete with European imports was to imitate them, in materials, form and decor.
 ''By attracting the business,'' Ms. Kirtley said, ''of America's burgeoning upper and upper-middle classes in urban and rural centers who were importing porcelain at fantastic rates to adorn their sideboards, tea tables, dining tables, mantles and basin stands, a local porcelain manufacturer surely stood to make a comfortable living.'' 
 In 1826 William Ellis Tucker founded a porcelain factory in downtown Philadelphia. One of 11 children of Benjamin Tucker, a prominent Quaker businessman whose commercial interests included a china shop in Philadelphia, William worked in the shop and was trained as a china painter. Because his father was a member of the Franklin Institute, which promoted the study of science, William had access to the institute's library and the nearby apprentices' library.
 ''Both libraries had books and manuals that instructed on the manufacture of porcelain,'' Ms. Kirtley said. Father and son devised their own secret recipes, and by 1826 William was ready to open his factory on 23rd and Chestnut Streets. He also bought land in Delaware and New Jersey that supplied minerals and clay. In 1828, at his father's insistence, he hired his brother Thomas, who was 12 years younger, as an apprentice.
 William was ambitious. In addition to dinner services, basin sets, flower pots, inkstands and pitchers, he produced tea sets and huge decorative urns. In the beginning, the wares were plain white with thin bands of gold as decoration. Then came the exquisite, hand-painted bouquets of flowers that resembled contemporary ''Old Paris'' porcelain. Even today, most collectors prefer pieces with the colorful, hand-painted bouquets of roses, violets, tulips, cornflowers and forget-me-nots.
 The quality of the porcelain was soon recognized. In 1827 Tucker won a prize at the Franklin Institute ''for the best specimen of porcelain to be made in Pennsylvania.'' 
 His brother Thomas developed into a good design manager and a talented painter; he eventually became the top decorator of the company, which he took over after William's untimely death in 1832. Thomas expanded the range of decorative motifs to include scenic landscapes painted in sepia and portraits of local heroes from the Revolutionary War.
 ''Thomas Tucker's imagination was limitless,'' Ms. Kirtley said.
 Still, the company's finances were unstable, and infusions of capital were needed. In 1832, Judge Joseph Hemphill of Philadelphia invested $7,000 and installed his son Alexander as partner. After William died, Ms. Kirtley said, ''Hemphill purchased from the estate William's share of the porcelain manufactory.'' The porcelain was briefly marked ''Jos. Hemphill, Philad.'' In 1835 the firm was renamed the American Porcelain Company. There were more portraits of famous figures like Napoleon and Lafayette. (''Ceramics were meant to elicit conversation,'' Ms. Kirtley said.) 
 To appeal to regional pride, William also copied prints of Philadelphia landmarks by local artists like Thomas Birch. Porcelain with images of the Fairmount waterworks or the dam on the Schuylkill River was particularly sought-after. 
 But Tucker could not withstand the onslaught of cheaper imports from Europe -- and economic instability at home. ''Strained by the failures of the Bank of the United States in 1833 and 1835, Hemphill was forced to recuse himself,'' Ms. Kirtley said. The factory closed in 1838.
 There are few source books on Tucker. In a 1972 thesis about the company, ''Tucker Porcelain, 1826-1838: A Reappraisal,'' Philip Houston Curtis wrote: ''The story of the Tucker factory presents a classic dichotomy between the rise of American nationalism and the American dependence on European precedents. While the factory was founded on the principle of supplying an American market with American-made goods, it was, nevertheless, totally dependent on Europe for its styles and practices.''
 The loan show at the Ceramics Fair included a pair of beaker-shaped vases that depict two grand Philadelphia houses, both still standing in Fairmount Park, named ''The Solitude'' and ''Woodlands.'' 
 While Tucker porcelain is not easy to find on the market, it is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum, among many others. Today, a piece can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $300,000. In 1997, Freeman's, the Pennsylvania auction house, sold a pair of Tucker urns for $291,500; one of them depicted Sedgeley Park on the Schuylkill River.
 Garrison and Diana Stradling, private New York dealers in Early American glass and ceramics since 1967, had some fine Tucker pieces, including a creamer decorated with a bouquet, at the fair. It looks like a simple bunch of flowers, but with a magnifying glass, one can see an entire townscape in miniature, with people walking in procession, within the banded decoration of the vase holding the bouquet. Was William sending a secret message here? The price for the mysterious Tucker creamer was $11,500.

Americana Results
 Last Friday, at Christie's, an anonymous buyer successfully bid $1.69 million for the Cortelyou family Chippendale marble-top pier table, which was made in New York about 1750. The sale set a world auction record for any piece of New York furniture, and a world auction record for a marble-top form. The Met acquired Robert Lion Gardiner's Chippendale mahogany bonnet-top chest-on-chest labeled Thomas Townsend for $856,000, setting a world auction record for a Newport chest-on-chest. 
 On Saturday, at Sotheby's, the veteran dealer Albert Sack bought the Nicholas Brown Chippendale tea table attributed to John Goddard of Newport for $8.4 million. (It had been expected to bring $2 to $5 million.) Sales like these make the American antiques at the Winter Antiques Show look like bargains.

HEADLINE: A Keys Resort Sells A Piece of the Nest

BYLINE: By CHARLES PASSY

DATELINE: ISLAMORADA, Fla. 

 BODY:
ROGER BERNSTEIN has long considered the Cheeca Lodge & Spa, a tropical-themed resort on this famed Florida Keys getaway, a kind of home away from home, an upscale retreat he visits every few months to ''drink lots of fruity drinks'' and work on his tennis game. So, this last year, Mr. Bernstein, a Miami lawyer, decided to take his passion for the place to the next level.
 He bought it.
 Well, at least a small piece of it. Mr. Bernstein purchased a $355,000 studio unit -- one of 92 ''resort residences'' the decades-old Cheeca is selling as part of its conversion from a traditional resort into a condominium hotel. It's a decidedly different sort of second-home ownership: Mr. Bernstein and his wife, Erica, and two children -- a third is on the way -- won't get to personalize their unit or even put in a washing machine. And they can only use it 28 days a year; the rest of the time, they will be required to place it into the resort's rental pool. 
 Still, he and his family get to swim in the resort's lagoon, get mud wraps in the spa and play golf on the nine-hole par 3 course. Mr. Bernstein is also betting that his property will appreciate. In the Florida Keys, where there's a limited availability of real estate because of restrictions on development, housing prices have soared -- more than 30 percent in 2003, according to Monroe County officials. ''My philosophy is investing in something you can enjoy,'' he said. 
 He is not alone. In recent years, one of the hottest trends among luxury resorts has been to develop some kind of ownership program, offering high-end ''fractionals'' (fancy time-shares), condominiums or even houses. Some projects mirror the Cheeca model -- a legendary property converting part of its rooms to condos. Others are being built from the ground up as condo hotels. Among the resorts in Florida alone that have condo projects in the works are Miami Beach's Fontainebleau Hilton, the Venetian Grand Resort in Orlando and Fort Myers Beach's Pink Shell Beach Resort. But the phenomenon has spread to other locales, including Las Vegas (MGM Grand Hotel) and Chicago (Trump International Hotel). Even the 200-year-old Greenbrier, in West Virginia, is getting into the ownership game, establishing the Greenbrier Sporting Club, a luxury development connected to the property that will eventually include 500 homes; lots range from $400,000 to $2 million.
 Even before its recent renovation, Cheeca was distinct among Keys properties for its size -- a roomy 27 acres -- and the fact it offered hard-to-find amenities on this slender chain of islands like a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus and a sandy beach built up on the notoriously rocky shoreline. Then there's the blue-green water that has always beckoned snorkelers, scuba divers and sport fishermen to the Keys. 
 The location ''is an hour and a half away from Miami Beach, but it's like being on a Caribbean island,'' said Cecilie Jorgensen, who with her husband, Kent, bought two adjoining units at the hotel for $1.1 million last year. Adding to the feeling of remoteness is the fact that there's only one road that connects the Keys to the mainland. Which may explain why some Cheeca buyers opt to arrive on the resort's helicopter, which lands on the golf course.
THE lodge, now managed by RockResorts, was built in the early 1960's after a hurricane destroyed its predecessor, the Olney Inn, where Harry S. Truman was once a guest. The name was derived from a merger of the names of the two new owners, Cynthia (better known as Che-Che) and her husband, Carl Twitchell (an heir to the A.& P. supermarket fortune).
 The resort soon took on something of a celebrity cachet. Frequent guests included Sam Snead, Ted Williams and Bing Crosby. More recently, former President George Bush has often been a guest -- so much so that the resort holds an annual bonefish tournament in his honor.
 But in the last decade, as luxury resorts proliferated and spent millions trying to top each other with new amenities, it also became clear that Cheeca was no longer meeting the high-end standard. You can tell as much today when you step into one of the resort's remaining unrenovated rooms: the yellow wallpaper would be more appropriate in a Florida motel room of the mid-50's than in an upscale resort of the new century.
 The rest of Cheeca, however, tells a much different story. 
 With an architectural style that blends West Indian and Floridian influences, the resort, consisting of a main lodge, several two-level buildings and beach bungalows, has a relaxed feel -- what Cheeca executives refer to as ''barefoot elegance.'' And they mean it. Even though a weekend stay here during peak season can easily run $1,000 or more -- for nonowners, that is -- the dress code consists of little more than sandals and shorts (or a one-piece and sarong). And the otherwise formal dining room does not require jackets for men.
 The renovated rooms have been done up with mahogany furniture in the bedrooms, Italian marble in the bathrooms and a 42-inch plasma television for every guest's viewing pleasure. The spa -- added in 2001 -- has an adult-only pool, with cabanas that rent by the day. The 1,200-foot beach is lined with hammocks, perfect for a midday siesta.
 Best of all is a pier that extends 525 feet into the Atlantic -- so far out that you'll feel you're already on one of the resort's rental miniboats.
CHEECA'S makeover and its conversion to a condo-hotel property are inextricably tied to each other. In a post-9/11 environment, hotel and resort developers have found it extremely difficult to secure loans for new construction or renovations. So, they've sought another way: selling off their properties room by room to individuals. While it means forsaking a share of the revenue, it also reduces the burden of debt.
 Jerry Johnson, the managing partner of the group that owns Cheeca, said that the bill for renovations would hit ''at least'' $40 million. ''It wouldn't be economically feasible to do that'' running Cheeca as a ''straight hotel,'' he said.
 Buyers, of course, get a portion of the income from their rooms -- rates run from $295 to $795 a night, depending upon the season. There are downsides, too. For starters, condo-hotel living means hotel living, so items like extra closets and washers and dryers are out of the question. Units cannot be customized or decorated to an owner's taste. And there is no predicting the long-term income potential. ''This is not for the faint of heart,'' said Bill Dougherty, sales director for the Cheeca condo operation.
 Still, he has already sold more than 60 of the 92 available units, with little more marketing effort than a few mailings to former guests at Cheeca. Mr. Dougherty suspects a number of buyers just like owning a piece of a classic resort like Cheeca -- in the same way they might have liked owning a piece of a winery or a prize-winning thoroughbred in years past. ''It's an ego thing,'' he said.
 Or, in the case, of Mike Miller, an entrepreneur based in Ohio, it's simply an attractive business proposition. Having already bought condo-hotel units elsewhere in Florida, he decided to add to his portfolio and buy one at Cheeca -- sight unseen -- with a business partner.
 Then, Mr. Miller finally got around to seeing the resort in November when he came on a vacation with his wife. After a few days walking up and down the beach and lounging in those oceanside hammocks, there seemed only one thing left for the couple to do. ''We liked it so much,'' he said, ''we bought another unit for ourselves.''


CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article last Friday about the Cheeca Lodge & Spa in Islamorada, Fla., included an erroneous reference from the resort to Cynthia and Carl Twitchell, who owned it in the 1960's and for whom it was named. Mrs. Twitchell's nickname was Chee, not Che-Che; she, not her husband, was an heir to the A.& P. supermarket fortune.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Rise, but Not Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Orders to factories for durable goods increased almost 11 percent last year, the best performance in a decade, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
 But the rebound in orders, while creating more profit for manufacturing companies, did not spur much rehiring of laid-off workers. 
Businesses are increasing production with smaller work forces, analysts said.
 The most recent peak in manufacturing employment occurred in July 2000. Since then, 2.9 million factory jobs -- one in six -- have disappeared as United States companies face increased competition from lower-wage countries. In 2004, manufacturing employment posted a small increase of 76,000 jobs, but that did little to offset the heavy losses in earlier years.
 Durable goods orders rose 0.6 percent in December, compared with a 1.8 percent increase the month before. The rise in orders was led by a 6.4 percent jump in the demand for computers and other electronic products, a category including communications equipment, which was up 17.8 percent after a big drop the month before. The overall gain came despite a 3 percent decline in transportation, reflecting decreased demand for civilian and military aircraft. 
 The increase for the year was the largest since an 11.8 percent rise in 1994. It followed weakness the three preceding years -- durable goods orders dropped 10.6 percent in 2001 and 1.9 percent in 2002, then rose by a modest 3 percent in 2003.
 In other economic news, the Labor Department said Thursday that 325,000 people filed first-time claims for jobless benefits last week, an increase of 7,000 from the week before, when unemployment benefit claims fell by the most in three years. The four-week moving average, a more reliable indicator because it smoothes out claims from week to week, rose to 341,750 from 340,750.

HEADLINE: Bobby Fischer, Facing Charges in U.S., Seeks Icelandic Citizenship

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Bobby Fischer, the eccentric chess champion who is being detained in Japan as he fights deportation to the United States, is trying to resolve his legal problems by becoming an Icelandic citizen, officials in Iceland said Thursday. 
 Iceland decided to issue a resident's permit to Mr. Fischer last month. But in a letter dated Jan. 19, Mr. Fischer asked the Icelandic Parliament to grant him citizenship, saying that ''the Icelandic authorities' recent offer of residence and of entry to Iceland without a passport has not sufficed to prompt the hardheaded and hardhearted Japanese authorities/kidnappers to let me go to your excellent country.'' 
 Mr. Fischer, 61, faces charges in the United States that he violated economic penalties against Yugoslavia by playing an exhibition match there in 1992. He beat the Russian player Boris Spassky, his old nemesis, and collected $3.3 million.
 The United States revoked his passport in December 2003, and he was arrested at Narita Airport near Tokyo last July as he tried to board a plane for Manila. Since then he has been held at an immigration detention center and has been fighting Japan's efforts to deport him to the United States.
 Some Icelanders have a soft spot, almost a proprietary feeling, for Mr. Fischer because it was in Reykjavik that he defeated Mr. Spassky to win the world championship in 1972, in a thrilling match seen as a crucial Cold War showdown.
 ''There is a very positive atmosphere in the Althing and among the Icelandic nation,'' said Einar S. Einarsson, a spokesman for the Icelandic Chess Federation, referring to the Icelandic Parliament. ''We think he is already part of the Icelandic modern saga, so he should be granted citizenship.''
 Mr. Fischer would need special permission from Parliament to obtain citizenship, which is by no means a sure thing. 
 ''It is far from obvious that the Parliament will accept his request,'' said Bjarni Benediktsson, a member from the governing Conservative Party and chairman of the parliamentary committee that advises on citizenship issues. ''We would have to have some further reason to grant the citizenship, other than the fact that he has a legal battle in Japan.
 ''As far as Parliament's decision would be likely to be provocative to the Japanese authorities, there would be less reason for us to step in. We would also not want to set an example where persons in that situation, without any further links to Iceland, would just go ahead and apply for citizenship in Iceland just to get out of a legal situation in another country.''
 In recent years, Mr. Fischer's extraordinary chess career has been eclipsed by his increasingly erratic behavior, characterized by a propensity for lawsuits and a tendency to make virulently anti-Semitic outbursts. Since the United States issued a warrant for his arrest in 1992, he has also habitually denounced America on radio stations in Iceland, Hungary and the Philippines.
 In his letter, Mr. Fischer accused the Japanese government of illegally imprisoning him on ''completely false and ludicrous grounds'' and asserted that his health had been steadily worsening since his arrest, when, he said, he had been ''seriously injured and very nearly killed.'' 
 Mr. Fischer's previous attempts to avoid deportation -- seeking political asylum in Japan, marrying a Japanese woman and declaring that he had renounced his American citizenship -- have failed to persuade the Japanese authorities. But in September a Japanese court ruled that he could remain there until his lawsuit against deportation had been heard.

HEADLINE: Membership In Unions Drops Again

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The percentage of Americans belonging to labor unions fell last year to the lowest level in more than six decades, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced yesterday.
 The segment of all workers in unions dropped to 12.5 percent last year from 12.9 percent in 2003, the bureau said, while the percentage of private-sector workers in unions fell to 7.9 percent from 8.2 percent, making it the lowest level since the early 1900's.
 The numbers were reported as organized labor debates how to reverse its steady decline, from its peak in the 1950's when it represented 35 percent of all workers. 
 The report showed that the public sector remained a labor stronghold, with 36.4 percent of government workers unionized, more than four times the rate in the private sector. But even that was a decline from 37.2 percent the year before, and labor suffered a further setback this month when the new Republican governors of Indiana and Missouri ordered an end to collective bargaining rights for state employees.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the number of union members fell last year to 15.5 million, down 300,000 from 2003.
 Labor relations experts said a reason for the decline was the loss of jobs in manufacturing, which was traditionally labor's greatest stronghold. The nation has lost three million factory jobs over the past four and a half years. While the number of manufacturing jobs actually climbed slightly last year, labor leaders said, unionized factories continued to be hit hard.
 ''The numbers illustrate the convergence of two painful trends for America's working families,'' Sarah Massey, a spokeswoman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said. ''The climate for workers who want to organize unions to better their economic situation is increasingly antagonistic, and good jobs are still disappearing.''
 Julius Getman, a labor relations expert at the University of Texas, said: ''A remarkable fact is the percentage of workers in unions is so much lower than the percentage of workers who say in polls that they want to be in unions. It's around 50 percent.'' He attributed labor's decline to lackluster recruitment and employer opposition to unionizing. 
 New York had the highest percentage of workers in unions, 25.3 percent, and North Carolina has the lowest percentage -- 2.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Joining Old Pals In New Places

BYLINE: By FELICIA PAIK

 BODY:
ONE of the hardest things about moving to a new place, even if it's to the paradise you have always dreamed of, is leaving the comfortable old neighborhood behind. Unless, of course, you take the neighborhood with you.
 That's pretty much what Jack Fabian and Regina Pavelko-Fabian have done, though it wasn't exactly their intention when they bought property in 1999 in a new retirement community, Sun City Lincoln Hills, just outside Sacramento, Calif. Mr. Fabian, a retired purchasing manager, and his wife picked the new place, not far from their old home in nearby Rockland, Calif., for its amenities -- it looks like a college campus with a rolling landscape, pools, tennis courts, a golf course and even a softball stadium -- and for its location, about two hours from either Lake Tahoe or San Francisco.
 Then the old neighbors started to come calling, liking what they saw, and deciding to buy into the community, too. Danette and Mike Marcus, a former administrative assistant and a retired Hewlett-Packard engineer, respectively, were first, moving in 2000. ''It's nice to see the old neighbors in the new neighborhood,'' said Mrs. Marcus, 63. ''As you get older, it's nice to know people are there if you need them.'' 
 Then came Bob and Sherry Doney, a former warehouse employee and a retired county worker, later in 2000. Stephen James, a retired high school principal and his wife, June, a retired loan officer, arrived next in 2002. And, finally Wendy and John Morgan relocated in the fall.
 The ''pack retirement'' contingent led by the Fabians now consists of five couples who used to live within three blocks of each other in Rockland. ''One by one we watched the older couples moving out here, and we'd get invited to their housewarmings and parties,'' said Mrs. Morgan, 57. ''We always knew we'd end up here.''
 The Fabians, though initially surprised to discover they had started a trend, are happy to be near ''people from our life before we got here,'' Mr. Fabian said.
 ''We're all here for the same reason,'' Mrs. Marcus said, ''which is to enjoy the rest of your life and make the best of everything.''
 Following a pioneering friend to an attractive town is not a new phenomenon, but as more people retire at relatively young ages and have plenty of money to spend, pack retirement seems to be more common. And some developers of active-retirement communities are adapting their selling strategies to capitalize on the trend of social groups' moving together.
 ''People are transplanting their social dynamic instead of having to reinvent it,'' said Steven Elliott, chief executive of the Lyle Anderson Company, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., which manages and builds communities in Arizona, New Mexico and Hawaii. The company is now studying how best to sell home sites to couples or family groups that move together at Las Campanas, its 4,800-acre property in Santa Fe, N.M., Mr. Elliott said. ''We're thinking about selling to families even before we draw the lot lines so that people can design their own minicompound.''
 At 890-acre Superstition Mountain, the company's development near Phoenix, homeowners are encouraged to invite friends interested in buying a home to visit and, perhaps, rent a model villa to give the lifestyle a try.
 Enticing old friends to share a new community has obvious advantages, ensuring built-in relationships that can make a move less daunting, especially for retirees leaving places where they have had longtime roots. Vern Bengtson, director of gerontology research at the University of Southern California, said that people about to retire and move to a new place may feel ambivalence and uncertainty. ''It would make it much easier to make the move with people you know,'' Mr. Bengtson said. ''It's kind of like having your own commune.''
 And there are longer-term advantages.
 ''Maintaining a strong social network is one of the keys to healthy aging,'' said Daniel Perry, executive director of the Alliance for Aging Research in Washington. ''People who are isolated and don't have rich relationships are at a greater risk of losing their health and independence.''
 There is also a potential downside that makes some retirees wary, however. Moving with a couple of friends to a strange place could lead to a higher degree of intimacy and dependence than anyone had planned for. What if you make such a move and then end up realizing you don't want to be so close? 
 Jay and Ellen Carr of suburban New York discussed this possibility with their friends Don and Jane Kusel. ''We were very upfront about it -- that we weren't going to be joined at the hip,'' said Mrs. Carr, 57, a former corporate communications officer who retired from full-time employment three years ago. ''That if the friendship falls apart, then it wasn't strong enough to withstand anyway, and we'd have no hard feelings and go on our way.''
 For his part, Mr. Kusel, 62, a former school superintendent, said, ''Jane and I wanted to make sure we were going independent of the Carrs and not because of them.''
 The two couples sold their homes in Westchester County and moved within eight months of each other in 2001 and 2002 to Henderson, Nev., settling in Sun City Anthem, which was developed, like Lincoln Hills, by the Del Webb division of Pulte Homes in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
 So far, it's been a good arrangement. The Carrs and the Kusels still take vacations together and often attend plays and go out for dinner as a foursome.
 Retirees looking for new places to live are a hot topic for developers; as baby boomers age, they promise to create a big demand for retirement housing. The 55-and-over crowd is a population on the go. In California, for example, 42 percent of home sellers over 55 in the second quarter of 2004 were planning to move to other states, the California Association of Realtors reported. And people over 55 are used to having places of their own. The 55-to-64 group has the highest rate of home ownership of any age group, 81.2 percent in the third quarter of 2004, according to Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors.
SOME country-club friendships continue at new clubs after a move. In 1999, two years before he retired, Stan McMurray, a member of the founding management group at the Costco Wholesale Corporation in Issaquah, Wash., and his wife, Charlotte, bought a half-acre lot at Superstition Mountain for $500,000. They didn't decide to build until the end of last year, however.
 ''We wanted to make sure that we were really going to love it,'' said Mrs. McMurray, for whom the move meant leaving her longtime home, suburban Seattle. ''But we soon discovered it's like being on vacation year-round.''
 They bought a smaller house and are living there while waiting for their 5,600-square-foot, three-bedroom, six-bathroom house to be built, at a cost of $1.6 million. When they move in sometime in late 2005, the McMurrays will be three doors away from Karen and Rick Meikle -- friends for 10 years.
 The two couples belonged to the same country club in Seattle, and at Superstition Mountain, Mrs. McMurray and Mrs. Meikle play golf together practically every day. The two couples also socialize as a foursome. ''It's wonderful being together,'' said Mrs. Meikle, 56. ''I appreciate having Charlotte here so much.''
 Another pair of old friends who both moved to Lincoln Hills with their husbands, Mary Flinn and Dolores Marucco, have known each other since their high school days in Dayton, Ohio, though they lived most recently in different towns in California. Both like the results of their move but are surprised to be seeing each other less frequently than they had expected. The two women ''don't chum as much as we thought we would,'' said Mrs. Flinn, a former utility company supervisor. ''We discovered that we had different interests.'' They have also found that companionship for four is different from a friendship of two. ''When you add husbands, things change,'' she said.
 Still, Mrs. Marucco said, there are advantages in being close by. ''It's nice to know that they are there, and they know that we are here.''
 Meanwhile, in Nevada, the Kusels and Carrs have continued to ''give each other space to live our own lives while still enjoying each other's company,'' Mr. Kusel said.
 As Mrs. Carr described it, ''Moving together has been like a friendship savings account you can draw on.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Off Relaxing Rules For Big Media

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Media companies hoping to expand their television station holdings and to own both TV stations and newspapers in the same markets suffered a setback yesterday when the Bush administration decided to abandon its challenge to a ruling that blocked the relaxation of ownership rules.
 The Justice Department will not ask the Supreme Court to consider a decision last year by a federal appeals court in Philadelphia that sharply criticized the move toward deregulation and ordered the Federal Communications Commission to reconsider its action. The decision is a final slap to Michael K. Powell, the departing chairman of the F.C.C., who had advocated the changes. 
 It also throws into question the future of newspapers and TV stations owned by the Tribune Company and Media General, which made acquisitions in anticipation of further deregulation. Tribune's media acquisitions in Los Angeles, New York, Hartford and South Florida would violate the old rules, as would Media General's in Florence, S.C., and Panama City, Fla. 
 They would have to request exemptions from the F.C.C. if they were to keep all of them.
 Relaxation of the rules had been advanced by most of the broadcast television networks and many large media companies, including the News Corporation, Tribune, the Gannett Company and The New York Times Company.
 The networks have been hoping for rules that would allow companies to expand the number of television stations they can own, giving the networks a greater share of the lucrative TV station business. Under a law passed by Congress last year in response to Mr. Powell's proposal, one company can own stations that reach 39 percent of the nation's homes. Mr. Powell wanted to increase that to 45 percent, from the old rule of 35 percent. 
 Big media companies want to expand the number of markets in which they can own both newspapers and TV and radio stations. In the last few days, some of those media companies, most notably Tribune, pressed the Justice Department to challenge the appeals court ruling, lawyers involved in the case said. 
 Some of those companies said they plan to appeal the ruling, but they have little chance of success without the support of the Justice Department.
 Critics say there has already been too much media concentration, leaving readers and viewers with fewer sources of news and information. They further contend consolidation would stifle creativity and lead to a decline in local news coverage.
 The deregulation had been opposed by a broad coalition of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, as well as an unusual coalition of labor, consumer, religious, artistic and civil rights organizations. Some members of the coalition said they feared that further consolidation would increase the amount of indecent programming.
 The networks and media companies argue, however, that the growth of other forms of media, especially the Internet, has given people more alternative sources of news and information than they have ever had. Those additional news sources, they argue, are stiff competition for both TV stations and newspapers.
 The Supreme Court had set next Monday as a deadline for the initial filing of papers in the appeal. 
 Officials said one reason the administration decided not to seek Supreme Court review was that some lawyers were concerned the case could prompt the justices to review related First Amendment issues in a way that could undermine efforts by the commission to enforce indecency rules against television and radio broadcasters. Over the last year, the agency has issued a record number of fines -- and for record amounts -- and has been pressed by some conservative and other advocacy groups to be evenmore aggressive.
 If, as now expected, the appeals court decision stands, it would return the rules to the commission for further consideration. Lawmakers and some officials predicted that whoever succeeds Mr. Powell would probably not embark on a course of wholesale deregulation of the media rules in light of the political furor that Mr. Powell's plan provoked. But they also said the agency could ultimately reconsider and relax a few of the rules. 
 In a bitterly partisan vote in 2003, the commission voted 3 to 2 to approve a package of deregulatory measures drafted by Mr. Powell that would have rolled back decades of ownership restrictions.
 Together, the measures would have allowed a company in one of the largest cities to own as many as three television stations, eight radio stations and a cable operator, as well as a newspaper. In addition to restricting a company from owning both a newspaper and a TV or radio station in the same city, the current rules prevent a company from owning two TV stations in one market. 
 Mr. Powell, who announced last week that he would be stepping down in March, had made the relaxation of the ownership rules a central feature of his agenda of deregulation. He has said that the ownership restrictions are outdated because of technological changes, like the Internet and cable and satellite television that offer viewers hundreds of channels. He maintained that the increased concentration would not hurt competition.
 In some recent statements he has said he erred politically by not promoting the changes in a smaller, more piecemeal fashion, so as to avoid the political fallout that ensued after presenting the larger package of changes.
 Last summer, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia ordered the commission to reconsider the deregulation of the rules. 
 It concluded in Prometheus Radio Project v. Federal Communications Commission, a case filed by an organization of small broadcasters, that the agency had failed to adequately justify the new rules and had been ''arbitrary and capricious'' in the way it sought to relax the old ones.
 Mr. Powell responded by attacking the decision, saying it had ''created a clouded and confused state of media law.''
 One F.C.C. official said Thursday that the agency decided to recommend against going to the Supreme Court. The official did not explain why the F.C.C. made that decision.
 Officials at the Justice Department informed the F.C.C. this week that they would not intervene and seek to have the decision overturned. Late Wednesday evening, the general counsel's office of the F.C.C. sent an e-mail message to senior agency officials informing them of the Justice Department's decision, officials said.
 Mr. Powell, who was at the economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, could not be reached for comment. Audrey J. Spivack, an agency spokeswoman, declined comment.
 Jonathan S. Adelstein and Michael J. Copps, the commission's two Democrats, who opposed the changes to the rules, applauded the administration's decision, which they suggested was a sharp rebuke of the agency under Mr. Powell.
 ''This is a recognition of the failure of the commission to adequately justify its rules and is a recognition of its failure to protect the public interest,'' Mr. Adelstein said. ''This is an historic decision for the media democracy movement.''
 But Mr. Copps cautioned that the fight was not over, and that the next agency head should be careful not to make the mistakes Mr. Powell had made. ''This is welcome news, but we've got to be vigilant and not let anyone try to sneak consolidation through this agency in some piecemeal fashion.''

HEADLINE: African Crises Take Back Seat to Tsunami, U.N. Relief Chief Says

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Jan Egeland, the United Nations' emergency relief coordinator, said Thursday that while the international community had provided unprecedented assistance to countries ravaged by the Asian tsunamis, it continued to ignore chronic crises of equally catastrophic consequences in Africa.
 Mr. Egeland, who raised the ire of the Bush administration last month by accusing wealthy countries of having been ''stingy'' in meeting the needs of poor countries in recent years, said Thursday that with more money, the United Nations could save hundreds of thousands of lives in Africa, ''and it is beyond me really why we are not getting the resources we need.'' He described Africa's predicament as ''a forgotten and neglected quadruple tsunami of AIDS and preventable disease, of ongoing terrible conflicts, of lack of good governance or lack of governance at all in addition to chronic lack of food due to droughts.'' 
 ''There are 40, 50 rich countries that can foot the bill of vaccinating children and feeding children, and Africa should have exactly the same worth as the tsunami-affected region,'' he said. 
 He spoke at a Security Council briefing on Africa's humanitarian problems and to reporters afterward. He said African crises went unattended because protracted conflicts did not attract the attention that natural disasters like earthquakes or tsunamis did and because people did not think they lent themselves to demonstrable success. 
 ''We have to do a better job in advocating on behalf of Africa, not only how bad it is but how it can be fixed if you invest,'' he said. ''There is no better investment and no more immediate return on an investment than changing humanitarian condition in Africa. It may be that we haven't been able to sell the idea that it is as important and as inexpensive to save lives and stabilize in Congo as it is in Aceh and in Sri Lanka.''
 He told the Security Council that despite the best efforts of the international community, aid efforts were falling behind in many parts of Africa. He cited the Darfur region of Sudan, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Chad, Uganda, Guinea and Zimbabwe where contributions ranged from 10 to 40 percent of money pledged to highs of 75 percent.
 He also said that in countries where the United Nations had helped bring peace or monitor cease-fires, the lack of full financing of appeals had threatened a slide back into conflict. 
 ''In Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire and Burundi where there were big expensive peacekeeping missions, we have less than half the funds that we need for minimum humanitarian program and less than half of what we need to reintegrate the ex-fighters,'' he said.
 ''What I hope to see is the kind of immediate decisive international reaction to the crisis in the Congo, which takes millions of lives, that we just saw in the Indian Ocean, where, thanks to an immediate outpouring of donors and an immediate response by an effective humanitarian community, we saved tens of thousands of lives.''

HEADLINE: Saudis Shift Toward Letting OPEC Aim Higher

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Over the last year, Saudi Arabia has quietly endorsed a shift in strategy that was once championed by only a handful of OPEC's more radical members, like Iran or Venezuela, who were pushing for prices higher than those of the last two decades. 
 Instead of enforcing what has been OPEC's official policy since March 2000 and defending prices of $22 to $28 a barrel, Saudi Arabia, the group's most powerful member, has acted to nudge the group's reference price closer to $40 a barrel. Along the way, OPEC has grown increasingly fond of high prices, with crude oil trading near last year's records.
 While the century-old oil industry has been through a number of boom-and-bust cycles before, OPEC's strategy carries risks. For consuming nations, high oil prices could derail economic growth and plunge the world into lasting recession; for producers, it could mean lower demand for their commodity in the long run as consumers shift to alternative fuels or promote energy-conservation policies. 
 The shift by the Saudis adds to their uneasy relations with the United States. Based for more than half a century on cheap oil in exchange for security, those relations have not recovered from the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
 It also underlines a belief that after the oil shocks of the late 1970's and 1980's, modern economies can better withstand higher oil prices than in the past. 
 ''My view is the world is not suffering, as far as economic growth is concerned, from where prices are today,'' Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, told Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday. ''The price today doesn't seem to be affecting economic growth negatively, and we do not want it to.''
 OPEC's approach will be discussed this weekend when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna to consider whether cuts in production are warranted to fend off a slowdown in demand in the second quarter.
 Many OPEC oil ministers, like the current president, Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah of Kuwait, indicated recently that they would leave production unchanged. They estimate that keeping the current level of 27 million barrels a day will not cause prices to fall. 
 OPEC's policy shift has yet to be made public, but it coincides with an emerging consensus among analysts, traders, and oil companies that prices will be substantially higher in the coming decade than the average of $20 a barrel in the 1990's. 
 At a time when prices already seem high, oil-producing countries need additional revenue to deal with social and economic problems at home; many have young and rapidly growing populations, with high unemployment and rising public debt. That explains why Saudi Arabia is shifting away from its previous view. 
 Nordine Ait-Laoussine, a former OPEC secretary general and oil minister from Algeria who now heads a consultancy in Geneva, said, ''I don't know if Saudi Arabia has become a price hawk, but for sure, it isn't a price dove anymore.'' 
 Last year, OPEC's 11 members -- Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela -- received $338 billion in revenue from oil exports, a 42 percent increase from 2003, according to figures compiled by the federal Energy Information Administration. That agency, part of the United States Department of Energy, forecast a 2 percent increase in OPEC revenue for 2005. 
 Adjusting for inflation and population growth, OPEC's revenue per capita dropped to $600 in 2004, from a high of $1,800 in 1980. For Saudi Arabia, where the population has more than doubled in the last 25 years, per capita revenue has dropped from $22,000 in 1980 to $4,000 last year. ''They have higher revenue needs because they have higher spending, especially on security or social services,'' said Lowell Feld, the senior world oil market analyst with the Energy Information Administration, who compiled the figures. 
 Paul Horsnell, director of energy research at Barclays Capital in London, said: ''What OPEC is going through is a delicate choreography. Everyone recognizes that $20 a barrel is too low a price. All OPEC is doing now is accompanying where the market sees prices going in the future. But there's nothing terribly explicit about it.''
 When they met in December in Cairo, OPEC ministers were jolted into action by rapidly falling prices. Within weeks, oil traded in New York had tumbled from its $55 a barrel high in October to around $40 a barrel as the group met. OPEC, which supplies a third of the world's oil production and half of the exports, decided to trim its output by one million barrels a day, or 4 percent, to stem the slide. 
 The strategy worked as prices rebounded. Crude oil futures in New York are up 15 percent since the beginning of the year. On Thursday, crude oil closed at $48.84 a barrel, up 6 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 ''OPEC's actions speak louder than their words,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the PIRA Energy Group, an oil consultancy in New York. ''It was not so long ago that Saudi Arabia mentioned $25 as a fair price. But they seem to have dramatically shifted their price to $35 a barrel. They won't admit it because that would have enormous political consequences.''
 Because transactions on the oil market are priced in dollars, the currency depreciation in the last two years has been one of OPEC's main concerns and a central argument in favor of higher oil prices. 
 In its last monthly report before Sunday's meeting, OPEC highlighted that issue again. The report said that the benchmark was worth $23.50 if adjusted for inflation and currency fluctuations. That would put it at the low end of OPEC's current price range. 
 ''Their reference price is the OPEC basket and what that represents in terms of purchasing power for them,'' said Vera de Ladoucette, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil consultancy in Paris. ''Their alarm bell is $35 for the basket.'' 
 To be sure, OPEC alone is not responsible for high prices. Since the beginning of 2002, when the current rally started, a series of unconnected events conspired to push prices up -- the war in Iraq, production disruptions in Nigeria, strikes by oil workers in Venezuela and Norway, hardball politics in Russia and a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico named Ivan.
 Still, Saudi officials repeat that their government's policy is to keep oil markets well supplied, not rationed. Crown Prince Abdullah, who has been governing Saudi Arabia since King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, said in August that he favored oil prices of $25 to $30 a barrel.
 The kingdom took steps last year to nudge prices down, stepping up production to some 10 million barrels a day and accelerating its program to add production capacity.
 ''Saudi Arabia has concluded that for the first time since the 1970's, an overall expansion in production capacity is justified,'' Brad Bourland, the chief economist for the Samba Financial Group in Riyadh, wrote in a recent report. He said that Saudi Arabia had increased its capacity to 11 million barrels a day, with the addition of two new fields, Abu Sa'fah and Qatif, and is starting 2005 with excess capacity of about two million barrels a day.
 But Saudi officials remain evasive on a timetable for raising capacity. That issue is reflected in the debate over Saudi Arabia's pivotal role in the oil market, according to the Center for Global Energy Studies, a market analysis group. 
 ''Boosting capacity risks undermining oil prices and with them, the kingdom's oil export revenue,'' the group, founded by Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister for much of the 1970's and 1980's, said this week. ''Better, then, to save the money and seek higher prices, especially as these higher prices show little sign in the short term of undermining global oil demand.''

HEADLINE: Philips Plans Big Buyback Of Its Stock

BYLINE: By GREGORY CROUCH

DATELINE: NIJMEGEN, the Netherlands, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Awash in cash and practically debt free, Royal Philips Electronics said Thursday that it would buy back up to 750 million euros ($978 million) of its own stock this year and search for acquisition targets even as a previous purchase put a dent in its fourth-quarter earnings.
 Philips, the Dutch health care and technology concern, said a 16.7 percent decline in its fourth-quarter profit, to 498 million euros, was a result of a significant write-down of its stake in MedQuist, a medical transcription company that is the subject of class-action lawsuits and investigations by securities regulators. 
 Philips's fourth-quarter sales rose 2 percent, to 9.18 billion euros, compared with the same period a year earlier. 
 Both its sales and net profit results exceeded many analysts' expectations.
 Philips had announced the MedQuist write-down of 576 million euros last November, and it was one of only a few negative notes in otherwise upbeat annual results.
 For the year, net profits at Philips rose more than 300 percent to 2.84 billion euros ($3.7 billion) compared with 695 million euros the year before. 
 Operating profit was 1.6 billion euros compared with 488 million euros in 2003. Sales increased 4.5 percent, to 30.3 billion euros.
 The results for Philips and its plan to buy back shares drove its share price up 4.45 percent, to 19.50 euros.
 Jan Hommen, the chief financial officer, said that Philips believed its stock was undervalued.
 ''The value of the share price could be higher,'' Mr. Hommen said in an interview. 
 The stock buyback ''seems like a good investment in our own company,'' he said, adding, ''It's a better way to use our cash than letting it sit in a 1 or 2 percent account'' generating interest.
 Gerard J. Kleisterlee, the chief executive, said in an interview that Philips would allocate a bigger chunk of its budget to increasing the company's name and brand recognition in the United States this year.
 The company did not release performance figures for its long-suffering consumer electronics business in the United States, but indicated that things were improving. 
 An official of Philips once threatened to stop selling consumer electronics in the United States altogether if the company could not make a profit.
 ''We aren't considering closing it, so you can draw your own conclusions,'' Mr. Kleisterlee said in an interview. ''We are comfortable with where we are.''
 Philips said it was guardedly optimistic about the coming year, but remained concerned about the fragility of world economies.

HEADLINE: A Round of Profit Taking Leaves Share Prices Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Uneasy investors kept stocks mixed yesterday, taking profits as oil prices rose and Wall Street grew more anxious about the coming elections in Iraq.
 Some positive earnings reports and talk of a takeover bid for AT&T were largely overlooked. 
 The opportunity to lock in gains, a rare occurrence in what has been a disappointing January, proved too tempting for many investors to ignore.
 A mix of economic data -- lower-than-expected weekly unemployment data and a somewhat disappointing report on factory orders -- did not provide a lift to keep the markets in positive territory for a third consecutive session. 
 Investors were also concerned about oil prices, which once again pushed toward $50 a barrel ahead of this weekend's OPEC meeting. A barrel of light crude was quoted at $48.84, up 6 cents, in New York trading.
 ''The past couple of days have seen some improvement, but it's been very tepid, almost a stealth rally,'' said Ken Tower, chief market strategist for Schwab's CyberTrader. ''With the downtrend we've been in this month, I don't think anybody's feeling any urgency to put money to work here.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.19 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,467.40.
 Broader stock indicators rose modestly. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 0.48 point, or 0.04 percent, at 1,174.55, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.06 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,047.15.
 Despite strong earnings, the markets have struggled to post gains so far this month -- all three major indexes have risen in only 7 of 18 sessions in January.
 Concerns about the economy, the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and rising oil prices have weighed heavily on the markets.
 ''The sentiment indicators were very strong in November and December, and people I think were just too optimistic,'' said Richard H. Driehaus, chairman and chief executive of Driehaus Capital Management. ''This is a very tenuous market, and you don't want to be too bold here.''
 The Labor Department said first-time jobless claims rose by 7,000 to 325,000 last week, less than the 333,000 economists expected.
 That bolstered Wall Street's hopes that next week's monthly job creation report would show decent job growth.
 Orders for durable goods -- products intended to last at least three years -- rose 0.6 percent in December, a decline from the 1.8 percent gain in the previous month and less than the 0.9 percent Wall Street had expected. Sharp drops in aircraft and military orders kept the gains minimal.
 The market was also nervous in advance of the elections on Sunday in Iraq, and the possibility that increased violence could either disrupt oil supplies or extend the time that American troops will be in the country.
 AT&T jumped $1.15, to $19.60, on reports that the company could be acquired by SBC Communications in a deal said to be worth at least $15 billion. SBC fell 91 cents, to $23.67, on the news.
 A Dow component, Verizon Communciations, swung to a profit in the fourth quarter after a loss a year ago, posting a 6 percent gain in revenue and matching Wall Street's profit expectations. 
 Verizon nonetheless shed 65 cents, to $35.87.
 Nokia, the cellphone maker, was up 89 cents, at $15.22, despite a drop of 13 percent in its quarterly profit. The company said that revenue increased 3 percent and that it had regained market share. Nokia surpassed analysts' forecasts by 7 cents a share.
 Treasury securities fell yesterday. The benchmark 10-year note fell to 100 10/32, leaving the yield at 4.21 percent. The 30-year bond fell 10/32, to 110 11/32, with a yield of 4.68 percent, while the five-year note fell 2/32, to 99 15/32, with a yield of 3.74 percent.

HEADLINE: Forget About All Those Films, This Year It's the Sundance Free Stuff Festival

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
The director David Slade, who is British but lives in Hollywood, learned a new word at this year's Sundance Film Festival. 
 ''Do you want to be gifted?'' he was asked on one of his first days here, where he has a film, ''Hard Candy,'' in competition. The debt-laden director soon learned that one of the latest rituals of attending Sundance is being showered with free stuff, a practice known as gifting. 
 ''There's cellphones, hair dryers, jewelry, jeans, makeup,'' Mr. Slade marveled. ''You feel a mountain of guilt. You feel immoral.'' 
 ''Then it's, 'Sure, I'll take it!''' he added. ''And the joke of it is, I walked away with more money than I got paid for the movie.'' 
 The festival created to celebrate independent, seat-of-the-pants filmmaking has been invaded by corporate America, which sees an irresistible marketing opportunity in the confluence of talent, celebrity and world media gathered here. And while the invasion isn't entirely new and hasn't quite eclipsed the movies themselves, the corporate presence at this year's Sundance Festival goes far beyond that of previous years.
 An entire area on Main Street is now devoted to giving away goods that companies hope to establish as brands among celebrities, while numerous storefronts and chalets have been commandeered by companies promoting (and sometimes gifting) cars, cellphones, fur-lined boots, fur-trimmed parkas and cameras. Companies like Philips, Fred Segal, Motorola, Sony, Kenneth Cole and Yahoo are represented. 
 The gimme culture of Hollywood -- where celebrities commonly expect and get things free -- has morphed and spread at this quintessentially low-budget festival, taking guilt-tinged greed to an altogether new level. During the festival it has become common to see not just celebrities, but also agents, directors, producers and even members of the news media walking around with huge bags of free items. People line up at the post office to ship large, identical gifting boxes home.
 On the first day of the festival, the William Morris agent Cassian Elwes could be seen with several bags stuffed with free merchandise at the entrance to the main gifting complex, called the Village at the Lift. This week cast members from the HBO series ''Entourage'' toured the Fred Segal ''store'' (nothing there is for sale), collecting jeans, shoes and whatever else struck their fancy, while the rap star Ludacris stopped by the William Morris chalet to get his free boots and cellphone. 
 ''People who are coming to the store are being introduced to the brand,'' said Mary Filar, marketing director for the upscale Fred Segal department store, which is here for the second year in a row. ''It's not about the swag, it's about education.'' 
 Companies hope the giveaway will help them establish relationships with celebrities and influential tastemakers, though the broad swath of people being gifted at Sundance made it impossible for representatives to say whether the practice was having the desired effect. 
 ''Pamela Anderson, she picked G-strings; Carmen Electra preferred lace bras,'' said Heather Patt, a spokeswoman for Le Mystere lingerie at the Fred Segal store, when asked about the ploy. Near her booth, another stylist was giving away $600 Walter tweed overcoats. ''Everyone is very appreciative, though I'm sure it's a little overwhelming,'' Ms. Patt said. ''For us it's great brand exposure.''
 Nonetheless, walking off with a haul of free stuff has made some people feel uncomfortable. ''It's like nothing I've ever seen,'' said an entertainment editor for a women's magazine, who declined to be identified because she was embarrassed by having taken the gifts. ''I've seen it for celebrities, but I've never seen it for lowly members of the press. You're greeted by a 24-year-old saying, 'Hi, what's your bra size?' It made me feel revolting.'' 
 Not everyone felt such pangs, however, particularly celebrities accustomed to the freebie culture. ''We've had a lot of people come in and say, 'I want a plasma,''' said Nichole Woodcock, a representative for the Philips lounge at the festival, referring to the flat-screen plasma television sets that adorn the suite. ''But we're used to it. It's our second year here, so we're used to people expecting a lot.'' She paused, then added: ''Sometimes people expect a little much. But that's what Sundance is all about.'' 
 As is usually the case, by midweek a number of movies had been bought for distribution. After the bidding war over ''Hustle and Flow,'' which sold for $9 million to Paramount, several other films sparked strong bids. 
 Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, flew into town on Sunday and quickly closed a $7.5 million deal for ''The Matador,'' which stars Pierce Brosnan as a hired killer. The studio chief had bid on ''Hustle and Flow'' and lost, but seemed determined to be part of the Sundance action. Mr. Weinstein also pre-emptively bought a horror film called ''Wolf Creek'' for $3 million just ahead of the festival. Many wondered how Mr. Weinstein, who is in final negotiations to terminate his contract with the Walt Disney Company, could be bidding on movies if he were leaving Miramax, which is owned by Disney. A company spokesman declined to comment, but a Miramax executive said that Mr. Weinstein would try to take the Sundance movies with him if and when he leaves the company. 
 Warner Independent Pictures, the art-house arm of the major studio, bought ''The Emperor's Journey,'' an emotional documentary about emperor penguins fighting their way through ice to their breeding ground, for about $1 million. Some audience members said the film moved them to tears.
 Universal's specialty arm, Focus Features, paid $1.5 million for the heart-warming drama ''On a Clear Day,'' about an unemployed Scottish shipyard worker who decides to swim the English Channel. Meanwhile, Lions Gate bought Mr. Slade's ''Hard Candy,'' a taut thriller about a young girl who tortures a suspected child molester, for $2 million. It features a castration scene that had people buzzing. The company also bought ''Rize,'' a documentary about youths in South Central Los Angeles and their latest form of exuberant street dancing, called krumping. The studio paid about $500,000, an executive said. 
 Paramount Classics acquired a movie from the rival Slamdance Festival, ''Mad Hot Ballroom,'' a documentary about New York adolescents learning ballroom dancing, for $2.7 million.
 Another movie attracting interest from distributors and enthusiasm from audiences is ''The Squid and the Whale,'' a wry, touching story about a family of intellectuals in Park Slope, Brooklyn, going through divorce in the 1980's. Jeff Daniels plays the writing-professor father, Laura Linney is the writer-mother, and Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline are sons buffeted by the painful split. 
 The writer-director Noah Baumbach, 35, based the film on his own experience of his parents' divorce. He said that he had struggled for years to find his voice as a filmmaker after making ''Kicking and Screaming'' in 1995 but had an epiphany at a screening of the Louis Malle classic ''Murmur of the Heart,'' organized by his friend Wes Anderson (a ''Squid'' producer). 
 ''I thought I should deal with this moment in my life,'' he said after an early morning screening on Wednesday. ''But it's why it took me a long time to get it done. There was a censor in me, not in a literal way, more in general, wondering what people might think and who would care -- it's only my story. Letting go of that censor was really important; personally, it was a breakthrough.'' 
 Mr. Baumbach's mother, Georgia Brown, was a film critic for The Village Voice, and his father, Jonathan, is a film critic and novelist who teaches at Brooklyn College. Neither parent, as portrayed in the film, is particularly sympathetic. Mr. Baumbach said it was all right with his real-life parents ''because they're writers.''
 The director had Mr. Daniels borrow some of Jonathan Baumbach's clothes for his wardrobe. ''I liked to use things that connected me to that time, in a Proustian way,'' he said.

+'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.

+'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.

*+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by an Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.

*+'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow water(2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.

+'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience to prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to David Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.

+'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and longtime Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, and featuring some funny riffs on familiar archetypes, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.

+++'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco (his last performance is Sunday), Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.

+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.

Off Broadway

*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. (Think ''The Children's Hour'' crossed with ''Agnes of God.'') But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.

'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.

*+ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.

*'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.

++'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction There are circumcision jokes aplenty, of course, and the requisite zingers about controlling Jewish mothers. and their daughters who don't put out. Several bits are funny despite the familiarity, as when a mother unleashes a volley of questions at her prospective son-in-law with the speed and accuracy of an ace machine-gunner. Later, a woman's status as an imposter is revealed when it's recalled that she paid retail for the Chanel bag. So it goes for two hours. Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.
CHARLES ISHERWOOD

'K.I. FROM CRIME' We can all bring to mind a list of literary characters it might be edifying to spend some time with, but Katerina Ivanovna, from ''Crime and Punishment,'' probably isn't on your list. A minor figure in the novel, she is the miserable, impoverished widow of a hopeless drunk. In a grim scene, she presides over a funeral banquet for her husband. Racked with a consumptive cough, she belittles the seedy guests who have bothered to show up, fumes at the indifference of the more respectable ones who haven't, bemoans the fate of her fatherless children. Now, thanks to the wonders of the contemporary stage, you're invited. Theatergoers who delight in audience participation will not want to miss the New York debut of the Lithuanian-born director Kama Ginkas. Audience members, who are conscripted into the roles of Katerina's guests, must listen patiently to her long tale of woe. But since most of the monologue is delivered in Russian, only those conversant with the language will grasp the nuances of her plight. Ms. Mysina gives a boldly physical, emotionally transparent performance, but there is no development of her character. And while it may seem paradoxical, involving an audience in a theatrical performance tends to lessen its impact. The self-consciousness that results shuts the lid on imaginative empathy (1:30). Freight Entrance Theater, 208 West 37th Street, Manhattan. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $40. Sold out for the run of the show.

++'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Ms. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousness of Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.

'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.

+'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the cliched. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $55.

Last Chance

+'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.
MANOHLA DARGIS

'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelganger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams and line their pocketbooks.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds (and in the process takes away Mr. Law's ''Sexiest Man Alive'' title without much of a fight).
A.O. SCOTT

'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, no relation to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown, as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.
SCOTT

'ELEKTRA' Starring Jennifer Garner, Terence Stamp, Kirsten Prout, Goran Visnjic, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 96 minutes). The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, ''Elektra'' stars Ms. Garner as a superheroine who dons fetish-wear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. ''Your parents must have had a sense of humor,'' the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no, they did not, and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. What she emphatically does have -- and this of course is the entire point of ''Elektra'' -- is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the Victoria's Secret catalog.
DARGIS

'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie, and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.
DARGIS

*'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Birol Unel) and Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about this two perfectly imperfect beings.
DARGIS

'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.
HOLDEN

'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.
DARGIS

'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (aka Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.
DARGIS

'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and new species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Acquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their own reveries and fantasies.
SCOTT

'A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG' Starring John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Shainee Gabel (R, 119 minutes). In this first feature directed by Ms. Gabel, Mr. Travolta delivers a hammed-up scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in ''Primary Colors.'' This is the story of a down-at-the-heels former star professor and his protege rotting in the New Orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folk-blues singer, and their partial redemption when the singer's alienated daughter comes to live with them. The film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise. The movie's hokey solemnity suggests ''The Mundane Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood'' or ''The Notebook Goes to the Big Easy.'' The movie is another example of Hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes South.
HOLDEN

'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr.Owen Wilson).

'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velazquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer, immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.

'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliche, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.

'MONSIEUR N' Starring Philippe Torreton, Richard E. Grant, Jay Rodan and Elsa Zylberstein. Directed by Antoine de Caunes (Not rated, 127 minutes). In French, with English subtitles. This densely plotted costume drama, which flashes back from the exhumation of Napoleon Bonaparte's body in 1840 Paris to the years leading up to his death in 1921 on the remote island of St. Helena, imagines that his official death might have been an elaborate hoax. The screenplay is peppered with Napoleon's epigrammatic zingers, which reveal him as the smartest person in the room. Mr. Torreton's glowering emperor exerts a magnetic if slightly repellent spell. Mr. Grant, as Hudson Lowe, the British governor in charge of the island, is almost as fine in the role of a raging control freak whose behavior is more stereotypically Napoleonic than Napoleon's. If the movie amounts to little more than a historical divertissement, it is well done.

'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in this enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick, a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues, and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean, played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction, is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again, Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack; Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan; and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs. Also on board for the return trip are Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Eddie Jemison, Shaobo Qin and a delightful Carl Reiner, joined by the new recruit Catherine Zeta-Jones as Isabel, a European super cop who favors curve-hugging skirts and the sort of dangerous high heels women wear only so they can kick them off in the bedroom.
DARGIS

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micro-managing phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, the prentious clutter of which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.
SCOTT

'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles -- all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all of them treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.
SCOTT

'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou, Gaspard Ulliel, Jean-Pierre Becker, Dominique Bettenfeld, Clovis Cornillac and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiance will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amelie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.
DARGIS

'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose resume hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that, on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror, and his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.
DARGIS

'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.

Pop

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

BOBBY BARE JR., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700. Bobby Bare Jr. is an even more eccentric Nashville songwriter than his father was. His music can float down-home Americana in a psychedelic haze; his lyrics are blunt, unsentimental and pugnacious as he sings about the road and some down-and-out characters including himself. Tonight at 11:30, with Sarah Lee Guthrie and Johnny Irion at 9:30 and Hula at 8:30; admission is $10.
JON PARELES

BLUE OYSTER CULT, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144 and The Chance, 6 Crannel Street, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845)471-1966. When science fiction met heavy metal and light-hearted fetishism in Blue Oyster Cult songs of the 70's like "Cities on Flame With Rock 'n' Roll," "(Don't Fear) the Reaper," "Godzilla" and "Dominance and Submission," it hardly mattered whether the band's original intentions were tongue-in-cheek. Its post-Zeppelin, pre-punk riffs, its wild-eyed lyrics and Buck Dharma's lead guitar lines still sound good. At B.B. King tonight at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $32. At the Chance tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $28.50.
PARELES

*TYONDAI BRAXTON, THE SOFT CIRCLE, ZS, ROB LOWE, PREFUSE 73, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. An appealing quintuple bill bringing together a crew of beats-and-noise-influenced eccentrics. Mr. Braxton uses effects and electronics and sometimes guitars to create resounding sounds and songs. The Soft Circle is the new project from Hisham Bharoocha, formerly of the (very) post-punk sound sculptors Black Dice. Zs is a band known for grand, saxophone-driven compositions. They are to be joined by Rob Lowe, the bass player from 90 Day Men (not, of course, the startlingly well-preserved star of the short-lived drama "Dr. Vegas"), and the producer Prefuse 73, who is to play a DJ set. Sunday night at 9; tickets are $10.
KELEFA SANNEH

CARLSONICS, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street below Stanton Street, (212)505-3733. Steeped in 1960's rock, the Carlsonics crosspollinate the Who, the Byrds and half a dozen garage bands for songs that revel in the way guitars work up to big, jubilant drones. Tomorrow night at 11, with American Watercolor Movement at midnight, Aloke at 10, Undersea Explosion at 9, Miniwatt at 8:30 and Pleasure Technicians at 7:30; admission is $8.
PARELES

D.J. LE SPAM AND THE SPAM ALL-STARS, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940. D.J. Le Spam's regular club shows became a sensation in Miami, where he mixed the electronic rhythms of dance-club music with live musicians steeped in Cuban salsa, and the balance has tipped toward the live band. S.O.B.'s has given him a New York outpost. Tonight at 11; tickets are $12
PARELES

*KENNY DOPE, APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 414-4245. Kenny Dope, the hip-hop-obsessed half of the pioneering house duo Masters at Work, comes to this meatpacking-district bar for a party that's sure to be cramped and sweaty and exuberant. One of the unexpected pleasures of living in New York City is the opportunity to see big-name DJs in venues as small as this one. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $8.
SANNEH

ROBERTA FLACK, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Behind the gentle, tremulous voice that confided hits like "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" is long knowledge of the continuum of blues, gospel, soul and jazz. Ms. Flack can use just a touch of rawness to make her songs hit home. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $48.50 in advance, $52 tomorrow.
PARELES

BUDDY GUY, LITTLE MILTON, THE HOWLIN' WOLF BAND, THE MUDDY WATERS BAND, ROBERT JR. LOCKWOOD, DAVID HONEYBOY EDWARDS, Avery Fisher Hall, Broadway at 65th Street, (212)731-6500. This all-star bill follows the blues from the Delta to Chicago, with spiky Mississippi blues from David Honeyboy Edwards and a jazz-tinged version of it by Robert Jr. Lockwood, who learned directly from Robert Johnson (hence the Jr.). Then come the Chicago electric blues, with two bands of alumni who backed Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, including James Cotton on harmonica and Pinetop Perkins on piano. The headliner, Buddy Guy, is a high-adrenalin bluesman who wrings drama from every speed-fingered guitar line and vocal rasp, and he'll be joined by the ever suave Little Milton. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $35 to $90.
PARELES

*KRISTIN HERSH/BEN WEAVER, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Kristin Hersh was the songwriter behind the jumpy, oddly cantilevered tunes and surreal imagery of Throwing Muses. Motherhood and perspective have made her songs more serene, though barely less enigmatic, and lately she has been touring with her hardest-rocking group yet, 50 Foot Wave. This is an acoustic solo set. Ben Weaver promises, "I'm not gonna give you what you want to hear," unless that happens to be hard-won, country-rooted Americana full of weary determination and aphoristic clarity, somewhere between the Band and Tom Waits. Tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7; admission is $15.
PARELES

REID PALEY TRIO, CBGB, 315 Bowery at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052. Reid Paley pounds basic chords and bellows his songs as he plays the role of the hard-drinking misanthrope, aiming for the perfect combination of self-pity and spite. Tonight at 8 on a bill with American Ambulance, the Droves, Kings County Queens, Peg Simone and Curtis Eller. Admission is $10.
PARELES

POPA CHUBBY PLAYS HENDRIX, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Popa Chubby hails from the Bronx, but his heart is in steamy, rambunctious blues and 1960's blues-rock. For this show, he's playing Jimi Hendrix songs. Sunday night at 8; admission is free.
PARELES

THE IDAN RAICHEL PROJECT, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824. The Israeli musician Idan Raichel moved from session work to a solo career in 2002, and his debut album zoomed to No.1 in Israel. His two album mix electronic loops, ethnic samples and hints of anything from reggae to lounge music to Ethiopian singing to pop ballads sung in Hebrew. His music can be simultaneously peripatetic and introspective. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 to $55.
PARELES

TOSHI REAGON AND BIG LOVELY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200. Singing about both love and politics with the same sense of independence, Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and syncopated guitar playing to songs steeped in blues and funk. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:30; tickets are $20.
PARELES

ROGER SANCHEZ, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Mr. Sanchez, a local DJ and producer, helped invent contemporary New York dance music, occasionally adding Latin rhythms to his clattering house-inspired beats. Ever since his 2002 award for a No Doubt remix, he's invariably called a "Grammy-winning DJ," although that title seems like faint praise. Last year he issued "Release Yourself Vol. 3" (Stealth), an appealing double-disc mix that starts with gauzy, disco-influenced mood music and ends with Carl Kennedy's buoyant and precise house track, "The Love You Bring Me." Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, $30 at the door.
SANNEH

*MARTIN SEXTON/JILL SOBULE, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. The singer and songwriter Martin Sexton can groan like an alternative rocker, slide like a soul man or leap up to a pearly falsetto. Singing about restlessness and love while he picks syncopations on his guitar, he can turn an ordinary song into a jazzy showcase, and a good one into a transmission from the heart. Jill Sobule's 1995 hit, "I Kissed a Girl," showed her light-hearted side, but her girlish voice and folk-pop arrangements can be subterfuge, as she ponders love, time and human nature. She knows that simplicity and innocence aren't necessarily the same. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $28.75 in advance, $30 the day of the show.
PARELES

TOMMY STINSON, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. The most famous tonsils in rock belong to Tommy Stinson, who was the wild-card lead guitarist in the Replacements when they belted "Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out." His resume also includes a stint in the latter-day Guns N' Roses and his own more introspective solo album. Tomorrow night at 11, with the Black Spoons at 10, Todd Deatherage at 9 and the Victoria Lucas at 8; admission is $10.
PARELES

THE UNSANE, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. Formed in 1988, the Unsane play intransigent hard rock: a chain of burly, asymmetrical riffs behind distorted vocal imprecations. Tonight at 9, with Monumentals, Lamont and Penny Winblood; admission is $10.
PARELES

LIZZIE WEST, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. Lizzie West sings folk-rocking songs about love, family and wanderlust, with a warm, reedy voice reminiscent of Natalie Merchant. Tonight at 9:30, sharing a bill with Lucy Woodward; admission is $12.

Cabaret

BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blase but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

*BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.
HOLDEN

UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrich-like cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.
HOLDEN

*'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra''' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30; $20 at the bar; $10 minimum.

*GERI ALLEN TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. Since the 1980's, like so many other jazz bandleaders, the pianist Geri Allen has diversified, making records that wind through folk and rock and lullabies. But she's also laid down a remarkable track record making straightforward trio albums with first-rate drummers and bassists. Her latest, ''The Life of a Song'' (Telarc), with the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette, picks up this thread, and it's her best album in years. She'll undoubtedly play some of her new trio music this weekend, with the bassist Darryl Hall and the drummer Jimmy Cobb. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.
BEN RATLIFF

HAROLD ARLEN CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592. In which singers -- including Ann Hampton Callaway, Paula West, Dena DeRose, Andy Bey and Grady Tate -- and a solid straight-ahead jazz band interpret some of the better songs of the 20th century, all written by one man. (Possible candidates: ''Blues in the Night,'' ''I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues,'' ''My Shining Hour,'' ''A Sleepin' Bee.'') Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $25 at the tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.
RATLIFF

BRUCE BARTH TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7000. Mr. Barth, who has made a series of fine if overlooked records since leaving Terence Blanchard's group a decade ago, is a reliable index of what the best of modern, mainstream jazz piano playing sounds like. A moderate, organized player, he swings as much as possible and doesn't let the music get away from him. But he also brings a degree of percussive aggression to the music, which sounds even more powerful inside these boundaries. His trio includes the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Montez Coleman. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum.
RATLIFF

*'GREAT LATIN JAZZ VOCALISTS' WITH THE LINCOLN CENTER AFRO-LATIN JAZZ ORCHESTRA, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)721-6500. Recently organized and working under the umbrella of Jazz at Lincoln Center, this ensemble is led by the pianist Arturo O'Farrill. Its stated mission is to play not only the work of the great Latin jazz orchestras like Machito's and Tito Puente's, but also music from South America and elsewhere in the Caribbean. It's a big step for the recognition and canonization of Latin jazz, and the project is starting off on the right foot. This concert spotlights the great singers of Latin jazz, and the guests include Graciela, of Machito's band, as well as the newer jazz vocalist Claudia Acuna and the marvelous salsa singer Herman Olivera. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $10 to $150.
RATLIFF

CHARLES GAYLE, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, (718)218-6934. A hard-blowing, occasionally brilliant tenor saxophonist, Mr. Gayle was notorious in the early 1990's as the living redux of the first free-jazz era; more recently he has pulled back from the precipice a bit. Tonight at 10; no cover charge or minimum.
RATLIFF

ARI HOENIG TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)675-6056. In the group led by the pianist Jean-Michel Pilc, the drummer Ari Hoenig can be as manic and furious as the bandleader; in other contexts he can lay back. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $10.
RATLIFF

STEFON HARRIS'S BLACKOUT, Dizzy's Club, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)258-9595. Arriving on the jazz scene in the late 1990's and becoming a worthwhile bandleader in a great hurry, the vibraphonist Stefon Harris has started to concern himself with reaching new audiences: his latest group is colored by synthesizer and powered by funk. But it still adheres to many of jazz's principles of interaction. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30.
RATLIFF

LATIN PERCUSSION SUMMIT, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. A gathering of some of the great Latin-music percussionists of several different generations, including the congueros Carlos (Patato) Valdes, Candido Camero and Ray Barretto, and the timbalero Nicky Marrero. Sets tomorrow night are at 8 and 10; cover charge is $30.
RATLIFF

*GREGOIRE MARET TRIO, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063. On bandstands run by Jimmy Scott, Cassandra Wilson, Steve Coleman and others, this Swiss chromatic harmonica player has been extraordinary, pushing through solos with incantatory power. Don't worry about the novelty of his instrument; Mr. Maret gives it all the gravity it needs. This is a new group, with the guitarist Charlie Hunter and the percussionist Mino Cinelu. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 a set, $10 for members.
RATLIFF

JIMMY McGRIFF, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253. Mr. McGriff came from the golden period of Hammond B-3 organ playing, starting out in the early 1960's; he helped create the durable American archetype of soul-jazz. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10 and 11:30; cover charge is $25, and there is a one-drink minimum.
RATLIFF

*JASON MORAN AND BANDWAGON, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. The imaginative young pianist's new album, ''Same Mother'' (Blue Note), busies itself with the blues -- not just the blues structure in jazz, but the blues. The results are probably not what you have in mind. In beguiling new music (with the guitarist Marvin Sewell added to his regular trio to see it through), he flirts with a durable idiom that could easily eclipse his own; instead, the music turns out stubborn and almost perversely personal, with a thousand edges. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night. The cover charge is $25; $20 on Sunday.
RATLIFF

NICHOLAS PAYTON TRIBUTE TO MILES DAVIS, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)582-2121. The trumpeter Nicholas Payton first grabbed the jazz world's attention with his remarkable feeling for early New Orleans jazz, and more recently made an obstinately spaced-out funk record, but he's spent most of his professional time dealing with the rich languages of post-1960 jazz. Here he'll be mining that territory alongside his best foil, the saxophonist Tim Warfield, as well as the bassist Vicente Archer, the pianist Scott Kinsey, the drummer Adonis Rose and the percussionist Danny Sadownick. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $35 tonight and tomorrow night, $32.50 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum all nights .
RATLIFF

JEFF (TAIN) WATTS BAND, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. Mr. Watts, who played with Wynton Marsalis's group through the 1980's and continues to play with Branford Marsalis, is one of the most influential, important and complete drummers of the last two decades. His attack can be monsoonlike, but he knows the value of open space, and he can take over a band with a simple, slow-building pattern. The group this weekend includes the pianist David Budway, the bassist Eric Revis, the guitarist Paul Bollenback and the saxophonist Yosvany Terry. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.

Opera

MADAMA BUTTERFLY The Puccini favorite returns to the Met after a mid-season hiatus. Giancarlo del Monaco's unreconstructed production plays the opera straight, with storybook images of rural Japan delivered without a trace of irony. The singers who opened the opera this past fall have returned to fill the principal roles. Cio-Cio-San is sung by Kallen Esperian, who gave an attractive and affecting performance back in September, save some insecurity in her upper range. Roberto Aronica returns as Pinkerton, a role that he sang more convincingly than he acted on opening night. And Vassily Gerello will again sing Sharpless, one hopes with the subtlety and luster he displayed earlier this season. Emmanuel Villaume conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.
JEREMY EICHLER

PELLEAS ET MELISANDE The cast looks very promising for the Met's revival of Jonathan Miller's haunting 1995 production of ''Pelleas et Melisande,'' Debussy's masterpiece of emotional ambiguity and murky Impressionistic harmony, a story of powerfully illicit love. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter sings the frightened and evasive Melisande and the ardent tenor William Burden sings Pelleas, the aimless, impulsive young man who falls hopelessly in love with her, though she is unhappily married to his half-brother, Golaud. Singing Golaud is the ageless bass-baritone Jose van Dam, who recorded the role under the conductor Herbert von Karajan in 1978. James Levine, who reveres this score, will conduct. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.
ANTHONY TOMMASINI

TURANDOT The American soprano Andrea Gruber takes on the daunting title role of Puccini's ''Turandot'' in the Met's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's gargantuan and glittering 1987 production, so popular that it is critic-proof. Ms. Gruber has been singing some formidable repertory since returning to the fold of the Met in 2001, and her enormous voice shows signs of wear and stridency. Still, her singing is fearless and impassioned and through sheer force of will she excels in the role. The tenor Johan Botha is a heroic Calaf; the soprano Krassimira Stoyanova brings affecting vulnerability and throbbing richness to the role of Liu. Bertrand de Billy conducts a colorful and exciting account of Puccini's final opera. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out; returns may be available at the box office.

Classical Music

*ARTEK Monteverdi has become one of this period-instrument band's specialties; for Artek's contribution to Music Before 1800's 30th season, it is presenting arias, duets and ensemble pieces from Monteverdi three extant operas, ''L'Orfeo,'' ''Il Ritorno d'Ulisse'' and ''L'Incoronazione di Poppea.'' Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights. (212)666-9266. Tickets: $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+.
ALLAN KOZINN

FOCUS FESTIVAL The grand finale of this year's Focus Festival brings forth some of the festival's bigger guns tonight at the Juilliard Theater. The Juilliard Symphony will be conducted by the eminent Dutch musician and new-music sympathist Reinbert de Leeuw. The composers are Shostakovich (Symphony No. 15) and Sofia Gubaidulina (''Stimmenverstummen''). The festival's subtitle and main text is ''Breaking the Chains'' with music by Soviet composers not much in favor at home during the first half of the last century. Some were always well known, some have become so, and others remain nonhousehold names. Tonight at 8, Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406. Tickets are free but must be picked up at the Juilliard box office.
BERNARD HOLLAND

MAYUKO KAMIO Given the notoriously long brunch lines on Manhattan's Upper West Side, it's no surprise that Lincoln Center has found an eager audience for its series of short Sunday morning concerts followed by a reception with the artists. This weekend Mayuko Kamio, a young violinist with a mature temperament and impressive technique, performs a program of popular music by Brahms, Beethoven and Waxman, as well as a new work by Ako Yasuraoka. Sunday at 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $20.
EICHLER

LAHTI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Osmo Vanska, who generated great excitement in his first season as music director of the Minnesota Orchestra and is undoubtedly doing the same in his second, comes calling instead with the Finnish ensemble that put him on the map. (Or was it the reverse? Or both?) You will probably not hear any time soon a more idiomatic and compelling reading of a Sibelius symphony than the performance of the Second here. The program also includes Sibelius's ''Pohjola's Daughter'' and two piano concertos seldom heard in concert, Tchaikovsky's Third and Prokofiev's First, with Louis Lortie as soloist. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $35 to $68.
JAMES R. OESTREICH

LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA As Pierre Boulez nears his 80th birthday, in March, the orchestra is celebrating with him at Carnegie Hall. In the second program, tonight, Mr. Boulez, the most analytical and scientific of conductors, puts Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' on the dissecting table, presenting a discussion illustrated by musical examples played live. It will undoubtedly hold revelations for hardened listeners, as it surely will for novices. In the second half, Mr. Boulez, who has long shown particular mastery of this score, conducts it complete. He leads it again tomorrow but replaces the chat of the first half with performances of his own ''Derive 2'' and Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: tonight, $10 to $35; tomorrow, $27 to $102.
OESTREICH

MET ORCHESTRA James Levine and his Met Orchestra continue their busy Sunday afternoon schedule at Carnegie Hall and bring the splendid bass-baritone Jose van Dam as guest. He will sing Mozart, Mendelssohn (from ''Elijah'') and three of Mahler's Ruckert Lieder. The orchestra continues its mini-tribute to Weber with the Overture to ''Der Freischutz.'' It also indulges Mr. Levine's taste for Webern, with the Symphony, Op. 21, and continues its strong support of Charles Wuorinen, playing his ''Grand Bamboula.'' The afternoon ends with the Dvorak Eighth Symphony, a piece these players did so resplendently a few years back. Sunday at 3 p.m. at Carnegie Hall. (212)247-7800. Tickets: $39 to $155.
HOLLAND

MUSIC OFF THE WALLS This series features thematic concerts by members of the Brooklyn Philharmonic tied to exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum. In the first event of this season, musicians will perform a program titled ''Image and Time,'' with works by Dvorak, Virgil Thomson and Ira Mowitz as well as the premiere of ''Voices from the Gallery'' by the prolific composer Stephen Paulus. The program is designed to complement the museum's exhibition ''About Time: 700 Years of European Painting,'' and a tour of the show is offered before the concert. Ken Selden conducts. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Auditorium, Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)636-4100. Tickets: $15.
EICHLER

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC The Philharmonic's music director, Lorin Maazel, is currently in residence and offers at this week's subscription concerts Honneger's tribute to railroad engineering, ''Pacific 231,'' and Ravel's homage to the ballet and the exotic, the ''Daphnis et Chloe'' complete. Off both these beaten tracks will be Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto with Stephen Hough as pianist. Tomorrow night at 8 at Avery Fisher Hall. (212) 721-6500. Available tickets: $25 to $90.
HOLLAND

PETER ORTH It is unfair to claim that tickets to classical music concerts are prohibitively expensive for most New Yorkers when the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series thrives. Individual tickets are $9, less than you pay for a movie. And the performers who appear are always top-notch, like the pianist Peter Orth, who plays a recital tomorrow night in the inviting auditorium of Washington Irving High School. Since winning first prize at the 1979 Naumburg competition, Mr. Orth has had an active career and made a specialty of dazzling Romantic era repertory. On this program he plays Mendelssohn's tumultuous ''Variations Serieuses,'' and six pieces from Albeniz's alluring and technically daunting ''Iberia.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street,, Manhattan, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9, $11.
TOMMASINI

TAKACS QUARTET Decca Records has just released the final installment of this half-Hungarian, half-English ensemble's Beethoven quartet cycle, and to celebrate, the group is performing the complete series at Alice Tully Hall. Its programs mix works from Beethoven's early, middle and late styles. A chronological approach may make more sense for listeners intent on following the composer's journey, but for listeners who aren't taking in the full series, the Takacs's approach has the virtue of showing Beethoven's development in microcosm within each concert. The program tonight includes the works in B-flat (Op. 18, No. 6), C (Op. 59, No. 3) and the final quartet, the F major (Op. 135). On Sunday, the ensemble ends its series with the Quartet in F (Op. 59, No. 1) and a reprise of the Quartet in B flat (Op. 130), which was performed in the opening concert with Beethoven's shorter finale, and will be played here in the version that includes the ''Grosse Fugue'' (Op. 133). Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $30 to $42 tonight; Sunday is sold out, but returned tickets may be available at the box office.
KOZINN

JOHN ZORN Having presented all of this quirky, inventively eclectic composer's string quartets in early 2003, Miller Theater is keeping up with the cycle by including his latest quartet, called ''Necronomicon,'' as part of a Composer Portrait concert. Included as well is the world premiere of ''Mysterium,'' six-movement work for a mixed ensemble of strings, woodwinds, percussion and electronics. There is never much point guessing what new works by Mr. Zorn will sound like: his influences are so wide-ranging that a work might include several varieties of jazz, klezmer, metal and synagogue chant, all woven together with a sense of evolved gamesmanship. The performers are Tara Helen O'Connor, flutist; Michael Lowenstern and Tim Smith, clarinetists; William Winant, percussionist; June Han, harpist; Stephen Gosling, keyboardist; Jennifer Choi and Jesse Mills, violinists; Richard O'Neill, violist; Fred Sherry, cellist; and Ikue Mori, seeing to the live electronics. Tonight at 8, Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $20; students, $12.

Dance

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.

MARIANA BEKERMAN DANCE COMPANY In ''Shameless,'' Mariana Bekerman, a choreographer born in Odessa, Ukraine, comments on the childlike nature of purity and play. Kevin Keller contributes an original score. The dance episodes range from an evocation of a nightmare to scenes involving mushrooms as phallic symbols and Hula-Hoops as guides. Tonight at 9, tomorrow at 8 p.m., Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (718)445-4028. Tickets: $17.
JACK ANDERSON

BUGLISI/FOREMAN DANCE Jacqulyn Buglisi and Donlin Foreman, two former members of the Martha Graham Dance Company, offer a season of premieres and selected pieces from their varied repertory. Among the new works for their sleek troupe is Ms. Buglisi's ''Conversation,'' the first in a planned series of dances exploring social issues with a taped collage of women's voices from around the world (tonight and Sunday afternoon). Mr. Foreman offers two premieres: ''Gravel Bed,'' a commentary on isolation and humanity's ability to overcome it (also tonight and Sunday afternoon) and ''Dream,'' to a score by David Lang for solo cello, to be played by Maya Beiser (tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $38.
ANDERSON

COOL NEW YORK 2005 DANCE FESTIVAL Work by 60 dance companies will be showcased in this free two-week festival. If past marathons at this handsome and inviting little studio theater are a guide, any one performance in this first festival weekend will bring you an invigorating mix of the sublime, the professional and the truly terrible, with a couple of great new finds along the way. And the price is certainly right. Tonight at 7 and 9; tomorrow at 2 (family matinee), 7 and 9 p.m.; Sunday at 4 and 6 p.m.; White Wave's John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street, at John Street and the waterfront, under the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn (718)855-8822 or www.whitewavedance.com (information only; no reservations).
JENNIFER DUNNING

E MOTION: NEW ASIAN AMERICAN DANCEWORK This program of all-Japanese hip-hop dance will feature the Bi-TriP troupe, grand champions at Amateur Night at the Apollo. The members fuse hip-hop, jazz, ethnic dance and elements, they say, of mime and illusion. The company directors promise to inspire, entertain and amaze, and we believe them. Tomorrow night at 8, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Queens, (718)463-7700, Ext. 222, or www.flushingtownhall.com. Tickets: $15.
DUNNING

'FOOD FOR THOUGHT' Dancers seems to be among the most generous of artists. This yearly benefit to support neighborhood food distribution programs will feature three presentations of dance, chosen by Miguel Gutierrez (tonight), Nami Yamamoto (tomorrow) and Heidi Latsky (Sunday). Work by eight choreographers under 23 will be presented tonight. Ms. Yamamoto presents work by Linda Austin, Cynthia Oliver, Peter Schmitz and the yummy-sounding Yummy Dance. And Sunday's program features dance by former New Yorkers. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194. Tickets: $10; $5 with two cans of food.
DUNNING

KEELY GARFIELD Ms. Garfield combines a blithe, dark sense of humor and a fascination with knotty emotional issues. In this program of new dances, she examines twins torn asunder and the reckless entrance and tormented exit wounds of love and estrangement. Whew. Today and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077. Tickets: $25.
DUNNING

PARALLEL EXIT The company will present ''Powerhouse,'' described as a dance-theater stage cartoon inspired by the films ''City Lights'' and ''An American in Paris,'' and set to music recorded by the jazz ensemble the Raymond Scott Orchestrette. Today through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo Theater, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $10; $8 for students and 65+.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.
HOLLAND COTTER

'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.
KEN JOHNSON

'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. But whether or not you dig the notion of ''faunal apparel,'' as its organizers refer to outside skins, the show has this to impart: from the moment you encounter the entryway exhibit, a Ziegfeldlike mannequin on a trapeze swing dramatically enveloped by a Roberto Cavalli cascade of pink ostrich feathers, to the outrageous Stephen Jones hat adorned with a crocodile head in the last case, you are on message that fashion is theater, and sometimes theater of the absurd. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65 +, $10; students, $7.
GRACE GLUECK

Galleries: Uptown

ROSWELL ANGIER, Gitterman, 170 East 75th Street, (212)734-0868, through Jan. 29. In the early 1970's, this photographer explored a Boston netherworld called the Combat Zone where strip joints and other sex-related businesses flourished. His documentary pictures of strippers and pimps are not sensational but matter-of-fact, tender and sad. A more recent series studying street and bar life in Native American border towns in the Southwest is similarly humane and visually poetic.
JOHNSON

MILTON AVERY: 'ONRUSHING WAVES,' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550, through Jan. 29. The sea was always a painterly challenge for Avery (1885-1965) who saw it as a landscape of forms in endless free motion. This show of his seascapes from the 1920's through the 50's, meant to focus on his treatment of the ocean in its many moods, includes paintings, watercolors and a selection of his sketchbooks recording trips to seaworthy places. The best of the canvases here are the later ones, larger and much closer to abstraction, done in Provincetown summers. ''Onrushing Wave,'' which gives the show its title, is a white field stroked with horizontal dashes of off-blue; in the foreground is a mountainous white crest that confronts the viewer head on, vertically striated with the same blue. At the painting's bottom, rows of tiny blue ripples giver whispering echo to the upheaval above them. These works stay fresh no matter how often you've seen them.
GLUECK

JOEL SHAPIRO, Cook Fine Art, 1063 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street, (212)737-3550, through Feb. 25. This is a fine, economical retrospective of the post-Minimalist sculptor's career. There are not any of the early diminutive houses but there is a small, toy-like bronze horse from 1973-4 that may surprise viewers familiar with Mr. Shapiro's oeuvre. Also on hand are dense, blocky abstract sculptures in painted wood and in bronze and elegant, sumptuous geometric drawings on paper in velvety charcoal and vividly colored pastels.
JOHNSON

Galleries: 57th Street

SUZANNE CAPORAEL: 'READING TIME,' Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, 730 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, through Feb. 12. A very accomplished painter, Ms. Caporael has made even more minimal the elegant painterly means she employs for her landscapes and figures. With poetic use of color, she evokes rather than defines imagery, by means of simple bands and bars of stroked paint. A high point is an evocation of the sea, made by a wonderful orchestration of strokes in various blues and lavenders on a gray ground, by which she brings into being a restlessly heaving body of water. She can can be witty, too, stacking strokes horizontally to produce the image of a personage (male) in a green sweater.
GLUECK

JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212)759-7999, through Feb. 5. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.
JOHNSON

KEITH SONNIER, PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212)421-3292, through Feb. 5. The best new works by this veteran light sculptor consist only of glowing, loosely gestural colored neon lines connected by black wires to small black transformer boxes. They are lovely, but in light of all the new technologies abounding in today's art, there is something quaint about them. You may feel a twinge of nostalgia for a time when neon promised a future far brighter than the one we got.
JOHNSON

'STROKE!' Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through March 12. Believing that aesthetics trumped politics, the black artists Beauford Delaney, Norman Lewis and Alma Thomas held fast to their commitment to abstraction despite pressure from activists to produce more accessible Social Realism. Brought together here, their paintings from the 1960's and 70's make an arresting combo: Delaney's light-struck canvases, covered with tiny wriggling strokes of luminous colors laid on a solid ground; Lewis's fields of glowing color invaded by ghostly calligraphic forms, Thomas's broken lines of rich color arranged in geometric patterns. The works play off each other to lyrical effect.
GLUECK

'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Leionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs.
JOHNSON

Galleries: Chelsea

THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)244-9081, through Feb. 5. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.
JOHNSON

CHARLOTTE BECKET, Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)924-0212, through Feb. 5. Ms. Becket's ''Wishing Well'' is a notable contribution to the department of extreme trash accumulation, kinetic division. Stacked tiers of paper, cardboard, bottles and other sorts of refuse sandwiched between sheets of plywood rise 10 feet in the air. In the middle of this tower of garbage, a vertical conveyor continuously churns up loose debris. It owes a lot to the work of Phoebe Washburn but has its own wacky humor and inventiveness.
JOHNSON

EMILE GUEBEHI AND MALICK SIDIBE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through Feb. 5. Lively studio portraits from 40 years and curious new photographs of heavy women seen from behind by Mr. Sidibe, the celebrated photographer from Mali, nicely complement the striking painted sculptures by the Ivory Coast-based Mr. Guebehi. Representing big, buxom women naked or partly naked and, in some cases, visibly pregnant, the sculptures look like the works of a self-taught artist with a thing for maternal women.
JOHNSON

KENT HENRICKSEN: 'SEASON OF DELIGHT,' John Connelly, 526 West 26th Street, (212)337-9563, through Feb. 12. By means of his own embroidery, Mr. Henricksen outfits with hoods, masks and leashes the amorous ladies, swains and cherubs that cavort across swatches of store-bought, faux-Rococo tapestry. His comical additions bring out sadomasochistic shadows obscured by conspiracies of innocence. Purple carpeting and yellow Rococo wallpaper designed by the artist enhance the giddily decadent mood.
JOHNSON

JAMES HYDE; RACHEL BERWICK, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262, through Feb. 5. Mr. Hyde presents rectilinear wall-hung compositions made of raw lumber, chromed steel panels, clear vinyl, paint, photographs and other materials in his continuing, rigorously playful analysis of formalism, materialism and Modernist painting. Ms. Berwick's vivid wall-size video portraits of a rare Galapagos tortoise and a life-size cast in volcanic glass of a tortoise shell obliquely explore the intersection of natural and human histories.
JOHNSON

OAN KIM, The Annex, 601 West 26th Street, (646)638-3785 , through Feb. 5. Two kinds of street photography, both persuasive, are presented in this exhibition of recent work by a Paris-based photographer. In large format, panoramic color prints, the bedazzled, off-kilter, intensely congested urban views suggest a nearly psychedelic disorientation. On the other hand, the more formally ordered, book-size black and white prints depicting mostly abandoned spaces and occasional lone pedestrians project an infectious poetic melancholy.
JOHNSON

CHRISTIAN MARCLAY: 'SHAKE RATTLE AND ROLL (FLUXMIX),' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through Feb. 5. In an installation by an artist known for hybridizing art and music, each of 16 video monitors in a circle show white-gloved hands gently playing with boxes, books, toys, photographs and other things belonging to a collection of works by Fluxus artists at the Walker Art Center. The various low-level noises produced by the hands and the objects generate a quiet, John Cage-style, surround-sound concert.
JOHNSON

Other Galleries

TONY FITZPATRICK: 'THE WONDER: PORTRAITS OF A REMEMBERED CITY,' Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-2144, through Feb. 7. These densely knit concoctions of words and images may be nothing new, but they win you over with their emotion and erudition, both illuminating the greatness of Chicago, as well as their physical solidity. Bristling with an undiluted palette of red, black, white and marigold and dotted with images cut from old matchbook covers as well as poems and personal reminiscences, they conjure up the glamour of bygone hotels, clubs and sports legends while evoking everything from quiltmaking and tattooing to cloisonne and Neo-Expressionism. These works count as highly disciplined exercises in nostalgia: their specificity reveals something new about the time and place they yearn for, as well as the medium they so deftly explore.

*'A HEAVENLY CRAFT: THE WOODCUT IN EARLY PRINTED BOOKS,' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212)838-6690, through Feb. 5. A lively overall view of the development of the woodcut is provided by this show of 15th- and 16th-century books acquired in the mid 1940's by Lessing J. Rosenwald, the Sears Roebuck heir, from the noted C.W. Dyson Perrins collection in England. Ranging from primitive to elegant in style, the books -- in themselves works by master printers -- contain illustrations by artists like Albrecht Durer, Urs Graf and Hans Burgkmair along with lesser names and the more frequent anonymities of the period. Among them are three rare editions of Aesop's fables; the ''Revelationes'' of St. Birgitta, produced in 1500 by the Nuremberg printer Anton Koberger and possibly illustrated by Durer himself, and the 1495 Florence folio edition, one of two in existence, of ''Epistolae et Evangeli,'' a book of Gospels and lessons of the Mass that is one of the greatest Florentine illustrated books of the period.

*EVAN SCHWARTZ, Schroeder Romero, 173A North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8992, through Feb. 14. ''Reclaiming Puberty,'' Evan Schwartz's New York solo debut, is a document through photographs of a transition from one gender to another. Arranged chronologically, the series starts with family snapshots of the artist as a pre-adolescent girl dressed in a oversized man's tweed jacket and as a sultry teenager in a floor-length gown on her way to a high school prom. Then the pictures change fast as Mr. Evans physically begins to assume a male identity, through a regiment of horomone treatments and a double mastectomy. Celebratory in spirit, the show ends with a second prom photo. In this one, Mr. Schwartz, handsome in a tux, has his arms around a young woman, his date.

PINAR YOLACAN: 'PERISHABLES,' Rivington Arms, 102 Rivington Street, between Essex and Ludlow Streets, (646)654-3213, through Feb. 6. Ms. Yolacan's provocatively discomfiting large photographs portray elderly women in carefully tailored off-white blouses, sweaters or scarves made wholly or partly of raw animal flesh -- tripe and chicken skin, mainly -- purchased from butchers. You can read her pictures as unusually visceral feminist poems about fashion and mortality.

Last Chance

ROZ CHAST: 'SEASON'S GREETINGS,' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)627-2410, closing tomorrow. For her first New York gallery exhibition, this brilliant cartoonist presents recent cartoons, many of which have appeared in The New Yorker, and a set of eggs brightly painted according to a traditional Ukrainian craft. The eggs bearing images of funny-looking people are amusing, but they don't compete with the cartoons' hilarious and uncannily acute take on the conflicted psychic life of ordinary, white, liberal Americans.

One of the most popular cartoonists of his day, Gillray (1756-1815) produced lively, hand-colored etchings that lampooned major public figures like the king, the queen and Napoleon, and many minor ones, too. At his best, Gillray's draftsmanly skill and visionary imagination puts him in a league with artists like William Blake, James Ensor and R. Crumb. Hours: Today and tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: Free.

KEITH HARING, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)560-0670, closing tomorrow. If you liked the New Museum's lively survey of the East Village scene of the 1980's, you will appreciate this selection of paintings and sculptures by one of the best artists to emerge from that cauldron of antic creativity. It includes subway drawings in chalk on black paper; large, dizzyingly patterned canvases and brightly enameled, cut-metal characters. Barking dogs, radiant babies, flying saucers, mythic monsters and all kinds of hyperactive humans animate Haring's delirious cosmic comedy.

HEADLINE: Weekender Jamaica, Vt.

BYLINE: By WENDY KNIGHT

 BODY:
''WE come here to ski,'' said Laurie Schnitzlein, echoing the sentiment of many weekenders in Jamaica. She and her family have been making the five-hour trek from Monmouth Junction, N.J., to their five-bedroom saltbox in Jamaica every winter weekend for seven years. The main draw, for them and most of the town's second-home owners, is the Stratton Mountain Resort, five miles from town, with 600 acres of terrain, 90 trails, 16 lifts and a vertical drop of 2,003 feet.
 But unlike the neighboring ski towns of Stratton or Weston or the elegant enclaves of nearby Manchester and Dorset, Jamaica has a distinctly funky vibe. ''Live and let live'' is its unofficial motto, and you're as likely to see a rusty Ford pickup with a ''People Eat Tasty Animals'' decal as a Subaru sporting a ski rack and a ''Don't Jersey Vermont'' bumper sticker. 
 Jamaica sits at the intersection of Routes 30 and 100, at the bottom of the deep West River Valley, rimmed by tree-covered mountains, much of their slopes national forest land. At its commercial heart, in a pair of two-story buildings begging for fresh paint, are a coffee shop-vintage clothing boutique-record shop and a yoga studio that sells Indian chutney and erotic candles. Next door is Muzzy's, a dusty, sparsely stocked hardware store where ''the old guard goes for coffee,'' according to Margie Silvia, owner of Margie's Muse, a treasure trove of woolens, jewelry and watercolors that is two doors down.
 Two galleries anchor Main Street, and another is to open this month. A general store, an antiques shop, a church, town hall and the Three Mountain Inn complete the commercial block. Nearby are a glass studio, a garden store and a meditation center.
 Jamaica's three rivers were used in the early 1800's to transport timber and to provide power for potash kilns. Today, the rivers inspire kayakers, anglers and artists as the mountains inspire the skiers.

The Scene
 Most weekenders are on the slopes by 8:30 a.m. on Saturdays: children in their ski classes or race programs and moms and dads meeting up with other parents. Everyone breaks for lunch around noon, some converging at the Stratton Mountain Club, a private club on the mountain with three restaurants, including the elegant Luna.
 After a day on the mountain, many families retreat to their second homes. ''The kids are happy to come back to the house at the end of the day,'' Mrs. Schnitzlein said. She and her husband, Steve, a general contractor, have three teenage daughters.
 Favorite restaurants are the Three Mountain Inn, the Outback at Winhall River and the Red Fox Inn, which is in a renovated barn and has live music on weekends. 
 The out-of-state license plates zipping around town signify the influence of second-home owners who fuel the town's economy by employing contractors, tradespeople, caretakers and household help. The relationship among locals and weekenders is ''symbiotic and amicable,'' said David Plants, an investment banker from Greenwich, Conn., and a skier, who bought a Jamaica farmhouse for $160,000 in 1991.

Pros
 Jamaica affords quick access to Stratton without the price tag of mountaintop properties. ''Stratton's a big mountain with varied terrain,'' said John Sohikian of Wilton, Conn., the director of technology procurement at the Omnicom Group, who has been skiing in Vermont for 17 years and whose 16-year-old daughter, Lauren, is a ski racer. ''They've got great snow-making capabilities and skilled groomers.'' Three other ski resorts are within a 10-mile radius: Bromley, Okemo and Magic Mountain.
 Nonskiers are enamored with the natural beauty of the area. ''It's my refuge from cement,'' said Carla Stranenberg, a yoga instructor who splits her time between Jamaica and the Kensington section of Brooklyn. The 772-acre Jamaica State Park, a five-minute walk from the town center, has a swimming hole, a 125-foot waterfall and miles of trails.
 Whitewater kayakers converge on the West River each May, when water is released at Ball Dam. Residents also kayak and canoe on Gale Meadows Pond and the Somerset Reservoir; the Batten Kill is popular for fly-fishing.
 Brenda Gotlieb, who, with her husband, Paul, built a seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house on Winhall Hollow Road in 2001 to accommodate the families of their three adult children, called Jamaica ''a very comfortable place to live.'' While Mr. Gotlieb commutes to Vermont from Manhattan each Thursday, his wife spends 80 percent of her time in Vermont, skiing in the winter and riding horses in the summer. Each Thursday, she heads into Manchester for groceries and a manicure.
 Many weekenders noted that Manchester, with its shopping and cultural opportunities, keeps Jamaica from being an isolated outpost.

Cons
 ''You can get Dinty Moore in town, but not fresh food,'' lamented Julia Genatossio, who moved to Jamaica from Cambridge, Mass., in 1999. She bought the Jamaica House, an old boardinghouse, for $143,000 and turned it into a yoga studio and retreat center. 
 You'll find hunting whistles, canned goods and a passable selection of Australian wines in the Jamaica Country Market, but no fresh produce. The Winhall (a k a Winny) Market carries some fresh produce, good-quality meats, local baked goods and a decent collection of olive oils and vinegars, but a broader food and wine selection requires traveling about 22 miles northwest to Manchester or 26 miles southeast to Brattleboro.
 If you're looking for a beat of night life -- even a hum -- Jamaica isn't your place. ''There is no bar scene to speak of here,'' Mr. Sohikian said. 
 Property taxes can be relatively high. Mr. Plants and his wife, Julie, pay $4,000 in property taxes annually on an assessed value of $170,000. Important town meetings are usually scheduled midweek, Mr. Plants joked, resulting in a form of ''taxation without representation'' for part-time residents.

The Real Estate Market
 ''It's Vermont -- you're going to find an old farmhouse, then a trailer, then the C.E.O. of Time Warner,'' said Sharon Emmanuel, a broker with Bondville Realty in neighboring Bondville. The array of properties is impressive: multimillion-dollar condos, hideous 1970's ski chalets and a smattering of saltboxes and farmhouses.
 When the Sohikians looked at properties 11 years ago, they found a slew of A-frames with ''burnt orange shag rugs and Formica countertops that needed major work,'' Mr. Sohikian recalled. ''Even with a $65,000 price tag, we said 'No way!' '' For $160,000, including land, they built a 2,400-square-foot saltbox on two acres in Stratton Gate, abutting the national forest. ''We don't have the convenience of being on the mountain, but it's quiet here,'' he said.
 There is one principal division of property in the area: on-mountain and off-mountain. Naturally, property closer to the mountain is more expensive.
 ''Many people end up in Jamaica because of price,'' said Ms. Emmanuel. For example, there are a half-dozen parcels of an acre or two on the mountain currently for sale for $300,000 to $400,000. Five minutes away from the mountain, you can buy 185 acres on South Craven Road for $675,000.
 ''A lot of people want a second home to feel like Vermont,'' Ms. Emmanuel said -- they want an older house with some land and views.
 ''Don't show us anything without a view,'' Mrs. Schnitzlein recalled telling the real estate agent when she and her husband were looking for property. They paid $214,000 for their 2,500-square-foot house in 1998. The walkout basement had already been converted into a two-bedroom guest suite, providing privacy for guests. The house is on three acres with views of Sun Bow, Stratton's southern slope.
 Properties on the market this week included a five-bedroom rustic-style home on three acres with a marble and granite fireplace from Vermont Country Properties for $399,000, down from $439,000; a four-bedroom contemporary with a hot tub, fireplace and one-car garage, less than five miles from the Stratton Access Road, for $339,000, listed by Winhall Real Estate; and a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium with a fireplace and bus service to Stratton for $299,000 from Vermont Country.

 CORRECTION:
The Weekender column on Jan. 28, about Jamaica, Vt., misspelled the surname of homeowners in the area and misidentified their community. They are Brenda and Paul Gottlieb; not Gotlieb; their house is in the Bondville section of Winhall, not in the neighboring town of Jamaica. The column also misstated the distances from Jamaica to four Vermont ski areas: Stratton Mountain is 10 miles away, not 5; Bromley and Magic Mountain are 15 miles away, not 10; and Okemo Mountain is 30 miles away, not 10.

HEADLINE: Dial M for Merger

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Saul Hansell contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
If SBC Communications succeeds in buying its former parent, AT&T, the reunion of two players in the old Bell system could set off another round of mergers in the rapidly consolidating phone industry. In other industries, a dwindling number of players typically means fewer choices and higher prices for consumers. 
 Yet in the telecommunications industry, technology is turning that logic on its head. Cellphones, high-speed Internet connections and video -- not plain old phone lines -- now determine the winners and losers in today's market. Cable providers and a host of new businesses that barely existed a few years ago can easily provide those services just as well as old-line phone companies. 
 According to executives close to the deal, AT&T and SBC, the second-largest regional phone company, could reach agreement as early as next week. But even if the talks stall, the industry reformation is likely to continue apace. 
 For most consumers, the spread of these technologies has reduced prices on services and will continue to do so in the coming years, albeit more slowly. Per-minute rates for cellphone calls have fallen from 56 cents in 1996 to 11 cents last year, according to J.D. Power & Associates. The price of long-distance calls has dropped just as sharply. Competition between new technologies has made it possible for consumers to get more for their money with unlimited calling plans, video on computers and ever-faster Internet connections. 
 ''Consumers have clearly won as real competition and the threat of future competition has developed,'' said Jeffrey Halpern, a telecommunications industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''It took the development of Internet phones and wireless to even the playing field with the Bells.''
 Few people envisioned this technological free-for-all in 1996 when Congress last overhauled regulations on the telecommunications industry.
 Yet less than a decade after the federal law was enacted, consumers are seeing a convergence of services barely imagined then, as television moves onto cellphones and e-mail moves from computers to televisions.
 Cable companies now sell phone lines and the Bells are making plans to enter the television industry.
 Meanwhile, Vonage, an upstart from New Jersey, offers unlimited local and long-distance Internet-based phone calls for $25 a month. And millions now buy mobile phone service from resellers like Virgin Mobile, which do not even own radio spectrum.
 Technology is not just realigning the players on the chessboard, it is erasing some of the biggest and best-known companies altogether. Regardless of whether AT&T is bought in the near future, that the company that created phone service in America could be for sale suggests how fast the industry has changed.
 In the 1990's, phone lines into consumers' homes were still considered the industry's mainstay. Now, they are ''dumb pipes'' that are conduits for broadband Internet access, video and other services. Wireless products are bypassing phone-line wall jacks altogether.
 ''Consumers want bundled packages of services from a company they know and trust,'' said Edward Whitacre, SBC's chairman and chief executive, in an interview late last year.
 Still, there will be losers in the industry realignment. Consumers are increasingly being pushed to buy bundles of services that, while discounted, can still cost hundreds of dollars a month. And customers in search of just a local phone line may not enjoy big savings. 
 Gene Kimmelman, a senior director of public policy at Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, for one, argues that the sale of AT&T would mark ''the end of the era of cutthroat long-distance competition and growing local competition.''
 Yet regulators are unlikely to block a deal between SBC and AT&T. In recent years, the Justice Department has approved several large mergers, signaling its intention to let the Bells, wireless carriers and cable companies get even larger. The logic appears to be that the cable industry and mobile phone carriers are a sufficient counterweight to the Bells.
 By swallowing its former parent, SBC would in some sense be reassembling a portion of the former Bell System, only this time it would stand among other oligopolies.
 For AT&T, a collapse of the merger talks would also mean the risk of continuing to die a slow death. The company is ensnarled in a seemingly endless price war as new Internet technology drives down the cost of phone and data services. It expects sales to fall a staggering 15 percent, or by $5 billion, next year. Few companies can survive for long with sales shrinking that rapidly. AT&T shares closed yesterday at $19.60, up $1.15; SBC closed at $23.67, down 91 cents.
 ''A Fortune 500 shrinking 15 percent a year is not natural,'' said Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Precursor Group. ''The pressure here is coming from a once-in-a-hundred-years technology that makes it dramatically cheaper to offer voice and data.''
 Internet and wireless technology, in fact, make it likely that consumers will continue to win regardless of what happens to AT&T. For example, Verizon customers in New York who pay $163 a month receive unlimited local and long-distance calls, a broadband connection, a basic television satellite plan and a national cellphone service. Those products bought separately in 1995 would have cost $142, but would not have included an Internet connection, let alone a broadband line.
 In aggregate, consumers are spending more, but they are also receiving more. Since 2000, household spending on communications has jumped 33.8 percent, to $164.91 from $123.23, according to TNS Telecoms, a market research firm. Most of the increase has come because consumers are spending more on wireless phone and high-speed Internet services, each of which has doubled in the last four years.
 But consumers get far more for their higher bills. About a third of American homes now have broadband lines that offer unlimited access to the Internet. A typical broadband line is also 25 times faster than a dial-up connection. In a battle for customers, cable and phone companies are now doubling and tripling their speeds at no extra cost.
 The same is true for cellphone services. Wary of scaring off consumers, carriers are throwing more minutes at them. Cingular Wireless now lets consumers roll over their unused minutes to the next month, while T-Mobile offers 1,000 monthly minutes for a flat rate of $46. 
 The discounts have made it cheaper to talk. Since 1997, the average number of minutes used by consumers has risen by 362 percent, according to the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association.
 Cellphone carriers are also discounting their handsets, which are lighter, smaller and capable of sending e-mail, snapping photos and playing music. Thanks to bigger networks, coverage has also improved.
 ''On the whole, consumers are saving money,'' said Charles White, a vice president at TNS Telecoms. The danger, he said, is that some consumers who buy bundles of services may not use all of them.
 Even for consumers who only want a phone on the wall, prices continue to edge lower. Residential spending per month on fixed-line phones has dipped 16 percent since 2000, to $47.22. The price pressure has come from resellers of local phone services like AT&T, and from lower long-distance calls. And now that AT&T no longer markets its services to residential customers, cable companies like Cox and Comcast are stepping in to take its place.
 With all these new alternatives, consumers may not miss AT&T if it is acquired. The company's stature has steadily eroded since its break up in 1984. First, rivals like MCI and Sprint cut into AT&T's once-dominant share of the long-distance market. Since 1996, the Bell companies have entered that market, and growth in wireless and Internet-based phones have eroded its business further.
 Regulators and the courts have played a hand, too. Last year, the Bells won the right to raise the rates they charge AT&T and other resellers that want to use the Bells' networks to sell local phone service. As a result, AT&T said it would withdraw from that market.
 If AT&T is subsumed into SBC or another Bell company (Verizon Communications and BellSouth may bid for the company, too, analysts say), it is likely to live on as the business division of a bigger parent. In seeking shelter under the wing of an offspring, AT&T could continue focusing on big corporate clients.
 ''The AT&T brand still has significant value,'' said Richard Nespola, the chief executive of the Management Network Group, an industry consultant. ''Ma Bell is just looking for a new home.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Budgets For Tax Rebate And No Big Cuts

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
With an eye toward the November elections, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg put forward a $48.3 billion city budget proposal yesterday that would give homeowners another $400 property tax rebate and avoid major spending cuts as the city enjoys a surge of new tax revenues from a red-hot real estate market.
 The budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 keeps the city's finances balanced without resorting to the tax increases, firehouse closings and deep cutbacks of Mr. Bloomberg's first two years in office. The mayor credited those early, unpopular decisions with laying a sound financial foundation for his latest spending plan, which also relies on expectations of increased state and federal aid.
 Mr. Bloomberg said an improving economy had propelled annual tax revenues to pre-Sept. 11 levels for the first time since he took office in January 2002, providing an additional $1.5 billion that will be used next year to help close a budget gap that was once estimated at $2.9 billion. Most of the increase comes from what city officials described as the ''feverish pace of real estate transactions'' that generated thousands of dollars in property transfer and mortgage recording taxes, an unexpected bounty that the mayor said was not expected to last. 
 In addition to the extra revenue, the administration expects to save about $900 million through cutbacks across all city agencies, which the mayor insisted will not hinder services to most New Yorkers. The spending reductions include $13 million from subsidies to public libraries that could likely result in shorter library hours, as well as $15 million in savings from restructuring after-school programs and $8 million saved by expanding a trial program that eliminates daily deliveries of hot meals to homebound elderly people.
 Other savings include $17 million from a reduction in staff at 49 fire companies, something the mayor chose not to highlight on a morning when he was scheduled to attend a funeral for one of the two firefighters killed Sunday in a fire in the Bronx. There is no indication that staffing levels were a factor in those deaths, but the firefighters union has argued that the cutbacks endanger the rank and file.
 Elsewhere in his budget proposal, the mayor left out roughly $300 million for social service programs and cultural institutions that the City Council had successfully fought to include in this year's budget. Also, while he included money for wage increases for city workers, it did not come close to what the teachers, police and fire unions are seeking.
 From the opening moments of the mayor's presentation in the Blue Room at City Hall, it was impossible to forget that the budget-making process, always political, will be even more so this year as the mayor seeks re-election. Mr. Bloomberg, whose challengers include the Council speaker, Gifford Miller -- whose cooperation he needs to adopt a budget by June -- mixed his fiscal message with what sounded like an endorsement of his own campaign for a second term.
 ''Now is not the time to change course,'' the mayor said. ''The city is benefiting from a resurgent economy and a more efficient government, but we have a great challenge. We must remain fiscally responsible, or we will risk losing everything that we have gained through all of the hard work.''
 It was a measure of Mr. Bloomberg's success at avoiding controversy in his budget proposal that Mr. Miller could articulate few objections to it. The speaker told reporters that it ''is a better budget, clearly, than the budgets that we've had to face in the past,'' largely because of stringent steps taken by the mayor and Council three years ago.
 ''There is some good news in this, in comparison to previous years,'' Mr. Miller said, ''but there's also a lot of bad news that he's not talking about.''
 Mr. Miller's chief complaint was that the mayor chose to defer for at least a year $1.3 billion of the city's five-year, $13 billion school construction plan, which the speaker asserted would ''feel like a cut to kids that are in dilapidated classrooms that are overcrowded, without science labs, art rooms -- basic tools that they need to learn -- in facilities that are crumbling and unacceptable.''
 Mr. Bloomberg and his aides said the blame for the deferral belonged to Gov. George E. Pataki, who did not include the money in his own proposed state budget released last week. The mayor said that he hoped the money would come through soon, and that at any rate, the deferral would not seriously affect construction, much of which he said was still in the design and planning phases.
 Elsewhere in his budget, the mayor expects $500 million in additional aid from Albany and $250 million from Washington. Among the proposed sources for that revenue are $75 million from taxes on Internet sales of cigarettes in New York, which would require an amendment to federal commerce law, and $12 million from state-approved fee increases for marriage licenses, copies of birth certificates and processing of other official documents.
 In laying out his budget proposal, Mr. Bloomberg stressed, in a tone bordering on alarm, that so-called nondiscretionary costs for Medicaid and pensions and benefits for city workers were skyrocketing at a pace beyond the city's ability to pay for them, creating deficits of at least $3 billion each year for the foreseeable future.
 He pointed to forecasts showing those costs rising to $24 billion in 2008 from the current level of $19 billion, adding that next year the amount of nondiscretionary spending would exceed all other city spending by $5.3 billion.
 City spending is considered to be the portion of the budget paid for by city money, which next year is expected to total roughly $34 billion. The remaining $14 billion comes from federal and state grants, mostly for education and social services.
 ''This city is no longer in control over its biggest expenses,'' he said. ''This is the key thing that is driving our difficulty in balancing the budget each year.''
 The mayor has long complained about the city's inability to curb increases in labor costs and Medicaid that are mandated by state laws or union contracts.
 Some fiscal analysts have argued that he should do more to lobby Albany for relief.
 ''The mayor showed a very interesting chart that showed that more than half of the city's budget is now out of the city's control,'' said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy group. ''That's an extraordinary statement, and in the long run I don't think it's an acceptable statement.''
 Key to the election-year appeal of Mr. Bloomberg's budget is another round of $400 property tax rebates to homeowners, which is expected to cost the city about $250 million. The mayor succeeded last year in persuading Albany to approve legislation allowing the city to offer the rebate for three consecutive years, but the mayor has angered upstate lawmakers who question why they should support increased aid to the city if it can afford a rebate.
 Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, said some Council members would most likely also question the wisdom of another rebate when ''we can't have money for seniors, we can't have money for culturals, we can't have money for libraries.''
 ''Clearly, members are going to bring up the rebate,'' he said. ''In the end, I think we'll get the rebate.''

HEADLINE: Brazilian Leader Hears Boos From Unusual Direction, the Left

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Between cheers and jeers, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva defended his record on Thursday before thousands of skeptical antiglobalization activists, saying his government was painstakingly laying the foundation to eradicate Brazil's gaping social disparities.
 Speaking at the fifth annual World Social Forum here in this prosperous city of 1.5 million people in southern Brazil, Mr. da Silva used the inauguration of a global campaign to eliminate world poverty to answer the growing chorus of critics on the left who contend that he has abandoned his working-class roots and sold out to global capitalism.
 Wearing blue jeans and a white coat, Mr. da Silva insisted that his government was steadily chipping away at Brazil's social ills, citing a handful of high-profile assistance programs for the poor and recent data showing that unemployment had fallen to a three-year low.
 He also argued that the country had successfully positioned itself on the international stage as a champion of poor nations by leading a global campaign against trade barriers and farm subsidies in wealthy countries like the United States. 
 But he had to contend with a constant cacophony of boos from a small but vocal group of protesters, some of them former members of the more radical wing of his Workers' Party. About half way through his speech, he paused to respond to the hecklers, who also distributed pamphlets that showed him shaking hands with President Bush and derided the Brazilian leader as a ''key ally of Yankee imperialism.''
 ''Those of you that aren't from here, don't be afraid,'' he said. 
 ''These people that don't want to listen are sons and daughters of the P.T. that rebelled,'' he went on, using the initials in Portuguese for the Workers' Party. ''That's typical of youth, and one day they are going to mature, and we'll be here with open arms to welcome them back.''
 Mr. da Silva's response to the protesters was met with cheers from thousands of Workers' Party stalwarts wearing red T-shirts with ''100% Lula'' on the back, many of them invited by the party leaders to offset any protests. The president's supporters drowned out the protesters' boos with chants of ''Lula!'' 
 ''When a minority of the population speaks out, that's democracy,'' Luiz Dulci, one of the president's closest advisers, said before the event when asked about the possibility of protests. ''But let's not forget to listen to the vast majority that applauds.''
 Nevertheless, the protest was a stark contrast from previous social forums in Porto Alegre, where Mr. da Silva was hailed almost unanimously as a hero of the left. Since taking office two years ago, he has rankled many of his longtime followers by embracing free-market policies and respecting the terms of a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund, which many of the Social Forum delegates accused of burying developing nations in debt.
 At the same time, though, Mr. da Silva, a former lathe operator and union leader, has successfully sold himself as an ambassador for the poor who can bridge the gap between them and the world's political and financial elite, who are gathering this week in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.
 ''He represents the voice of developing nations,'' said Salil Shetty, the director of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals Campaign, which is helping to organize the global campaign against poverty.
 Mr. da Silva said he would deliver the same message to the policy makers in Davos that he gave here. 
 Later, he left for the economic forum in the Swiss Alps, traveling on a new $56.7 million presidential jet.

HEADLINE: Ogilvie Sees Lots of Red at the Hope

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LA QUINTA, Calif., Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Joe Ogilvie figured there would be some very low scores in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
 ''I'm just surprised that I did it,'' Ogilvie said. ''You look at the history of golf; I don't think I'm going to be in any encyclopedias of golf.'' 
 Ogilvie shot a nine-under-par 63 Thursday to take a three-stroke lead, with the defending champion, Phil Mickelson, in pursuit. Mickelson, who also won the 2002 Hope, shot a 64 and is tied for second at 14 under with Fredrik Jacobson, who shot a 62, the best round of the tournament.
 Fred Couples and Billy Mayfair were in a group of five at 13 under, four shots off the pace. Couples had a 66 and Mayfair a 64.
 Ogilvie began the five-day tournament with a 64 and was at 17-under 127 for two rounds, the third-most shots below par through 36 holes in PGA Tour history.
 Tom Lehman was 19 under after two rounds at Las Vegas in 2001, and Joe Durant was 18 under on his way to winning the Hope earlier that year. Lehman's 125 total ties him with Tiger Woods and Mark Calcavecchia for the low 36-hole score, but Woods shot his score on a par-70 course and Calcavecchia's was on a par-71 layout.
 Players rotate among four different courses the first four days of the 90-hole tournament.
 ''Mickelson shot a 64 today at La Quinta,'' said Ogilvie, who shot his 63 at Bermuda Dunes. ''I'd say technically he's probably leading. Score wise, I am, but technically I'd say he's leading.
 ''That's Duke math,'' added Ogilvie, a former economics major.
 Mickelson used different math.
 ''I feel like I'm three back,'' he said.
 Mickelson was very complimentary.
 ''I have a lot of respect for Joe Ogilvie on and off the course,'' he said. ''I really like spending time with him because he's one of the more intelligent guys that we have on the Tour. His golf game speaks for itself.
 ''He's ready to win now, and it's going to take all I can do to fight him off.''
 Ogilvie capped his round with a daring shot on No. 18, when he lofted a 5-wood over palm trees to within 5 feet of the pin and made the putt for an eagle on the 543-yard par 5.
 Ogilvie, earned $1.4 million on the Tour last year, more than his previous four years combined. His best finish on the Tour is a tie for second last year at New Orleans.

HEADLINE: Bush and Kerry at Odds Over Health Care

BYLINE: By ANNE KORNBLUT and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Anne Kornblut reported from Cleveland for this article, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
In a reprise of the presidential campaign, President Bush and Senator John Kerry offered dueling visions of health care on Thursday. It was their most direct back-and-forth -- from two different cities -- over any domestic issue since Election Day.
 Mr. Bush traveled to Ohio to promote medical savings accounts and expanded information technology for doctors and patients, while Mr. Kerry, his former Democratic opponent, advanced his own health care proposal in Washington and attacked Mr. Bush's plan as ''window dressing.'' 
 The president's trip to Ohio, the state whose 20 electoral votes put him over the top in November, was his first out-of-town appearance since the inauguration and the first of several stops to promote his domestic agenda in connection with the State of the Union address on Feb. 2. In an appearance with medical professionals at the Cleveland Clinic, where he appeared with his new health secretary, Michael O. Leavitt, the president was jovial and energetic.
 ''We've got fantastic new pharmaceuticals that help save lives, but we've got docs still writing records by hand,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 ''And most docs can't write very well, anyway,'' he added, needling the doctors around him. ''Can you?''
 Many of Mr. Bush's remarks echoed his re-election platform, as he advocated private initiatives like the savings accounts, tax-free investments that can be used to cover health care expenses. Mr. Bush also called for $125 million in spending to promote medical technology, including more widespread computerization of patients' health records over the next decade. The program will be included in the 2006 budget the White House sends to the Congress next month, he said.
 ''The fundamental question facing the country is, Can we have a health care system that is available and affordable without the federal government running it?'' Mr. Bush said. 
 Mr. Kerry, too, harked back to his campaign themes, outlining his plan to expand health coverage to children, in a luncheon address before an audience of hundreds of health care advocates. He was greeted with a standing ovation and, after a few self-deprecating jokes -- ''I must say I did have to travel a few more blocks than I had hoped to get here'' -- the senator offered a blistering critique of his former opponent.
 ''That's how the president who promised to usher in a 'responsibility era' proposes to deal with a real and present health care crisis, even as he seeks to hype a phony crisis in Social Security,'' Mr. Kerry said, after telling his audience that Mr. Bush's plan would raise insurance premiums and leave families and children without care. ''You know what that sounds like to me? Sounds like a cradle-to-grave irresponsibility plan.''
 Mr. Kerry's proposal, which he introduced as legislation on Monday, would provide health coverage to the 11 million children who lack it by offering fiscal incentives to states. Currently, states pay half the cost of Medicaid, the government health plan for the poor.
 The speech was part of a calculated effort by Mr. Kerry to make his re-entry into Washington politics after his loss to Mr. Bush. When it was over, members of the audience crowded around him. ''You'll always be my president,'' one woman said.
 But the senator was not eager to address the subject of his political future. Would he run again? ''Way too early,'' Mr. Kerry said, dismissing a reporter's question.
 In Cleveland, the president's event had the sights and sounds of political stagecraft: Mr. Bush met with medical professionals for a photo-op demonstration of technical gear before appearing onstage in front of an audience of several hundred people. There, alongside a panel of Cleveland Clinic experts, Mr. Bush sat in front of a backdrop emblazoned with the words ''Better Healthcare, Better Technology.''
 Expounding on medical ''economies of scale,'' the need for the Food and Drug Administration to ''get generic drugs to the market faster,'' and even the tedium of having to read old magazines in a doctor's waiting room, Mr. Bush bantered about medical challenges.
 He used Florida as the hypothetical setting for a medical crisis, joking that he was making a sales pitch for his brother Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida. He cited cardiologists who disappear to the golf course on weekends as an argument for computerizing medical records so any doctor can access them.
 Mr. Leavitt, in his first public event as secretary of health and human services, introduced Mr. Bush as someone who had ''improved quality health care for millions'' and embraced the spirit of ''ownership'' that the president hopes will define his health agenda and other domestic policies.
 ''When people own their own health records, when they own their own health savings, their own health insurance, it produces better care, lower costs and fewer mistakes,'' Mr. Leavitt, a former Utah governor, said.
 Mr. Bush, for his part, offered his new cabinet member a wry welcome, saying, ''He's been in the job 15 hours, and he hasn't made any mistakes yet.''

HEADLINE: Watching America: Will It Listen to Foreigners, or Do as It Pleases?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
''WHAT stresses me most,'' the chief executive of Novartis, Daniel L. Vasella, said, ''is that we are getting new regulations from abroad without any consultation.''
 This has been the World Economic Forum that the United States government largely passed by. In a world that both respects and fears American power, there is worry that the United States does not care what others think. 
 Or, as Tony Blair, the prime minister of Britain, put it in a speech to the forum, ''If America wants the rest of the world to be part of the agenda it has set, it must be part of their agenda, too.'' He added, ''What people want is not for America to concede, but for America to engage.'' 
 It is a fair bet that Mr. Blair has given little thought to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or to the way the Securities and Exchange Commission can adjust accounting rules, which is what concerns Mr. Vasella. Mr. Blair was more concerned with global warming and world poverty. 
 The twin American deficits figured into concerns that the United States would do as it pleases regardless of the possible impact on the world economy. ''I don't see the budget deficit being dealt with,'' said Jacob Frenkel, the former head of Israel's central bank and now a vice chairman of the American International Group, a large insurance company. ''I am concerned with the U.S. current-account deficit, not because it cannot be dealt with but because of the way it is not being dealt with.''
 The explanation for less American government participation than in past years -- that this forum came at an awkward time just before the State of the Union address -- makes some sense. And there were Americans here, like John A. Thain, the chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, who gently suggested that the current-account deficit would decline if Europe grew faster. 
 Some Americans are listening. William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the S.E.C., gave a speech in London this week that dealt with some of the concerns, indicating the commission may delay enforcing rules against foreign companies that trade in the United States and may make it easier for foreign companies already registered in the United States to withdraw.
 The rule that has both American and foreign companies complaining is Section 404, which requires extensive reviews of internal controls in companies to assure they are effective -- and says outside auditors must certify the controls. ''It was an enormous, expensive exercise,'' Mr. Vasella said in an interview. ''It raised the question, for my employees, 'Is the trust broken?' because you control everything.'' Novartis has complied with the rule.
 The chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., estimated that 10 percent of large American companies would fail to comply this year, either because they could not complete the work on time or because material problems were found.
 A survey of 1,324 chief executives by his firm found that bosses around the world were less confident they could comply with rules outside their home countries. Mr. Vasella said chief executives of several smaller European countries told him they might try to leave the American market. He said he asked them if they would do so because they had something to hide, or because of the expense.
 Mr. Donaldson is wise to try to assuage European concerns, but there is a risk that other parts of the American government are less sure of the need to take foreign views into account. That may prove to be unwise for a country that needs help in many areas, not the least of them being in borrowing money to finance the twin deficits.

HEADLINE: Congressional Study Notes Ways to Collect More Taxes

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
The federal government could increase tax revenues by $311 billion over the next 10 years if it clamped down on hundreds of ways that individuals and corporations elude their obligations, according to a Congressional study issued on Thursday.
 The report concludes that the nation's system for taxing overseas profits of American corporations is so flawed that the government would save $55 billion if it simply scrapped the system altogether.
 The recommendation comes a few months after Congress passed a corporate tax bill that is expected to reduce taxes on overseas profits by nearly $40 billion over the next decade. The measure was promoted on the idea of reducing the ''competitive disadvantage'' that American companies said they suffered on the tax front. 
 The proposal on corporate taxes was one of hundreds aimed at closing what lawmakers call the ''tax gap,'' the gap between taxes owed and taxes collected, in the report prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan Congressional agency that estimates the cost of proposed tax laws.
 The study was produced at the request of the Senate Finance Committee, which held hearings last year on a wide array of tax loopholes, abusive tax shelters and administrative lapses that cost the government tens of billions of dollars every year. 
 Many of the report's recommendations are likely to run into stiff opposition from powerful interest groups, and many would arouse widespread anger among ordinary citizens.
 For example, the report said the government could raise $164 billion over 10 years by changing the laws that exempt from payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare a variety of fringe benefits, including employer-paid health insurance and child care assistance.
 The report also estimated that the government could raise $57 billion over the next decade by making it harder for self-employed people to avoid payroll taxes. And it said the government could raise $10.5 billion by expanding the federal tax on telephone service to cover data transfer over the Internet.
 In principle, the United States has a tougher corporate tax system than many other countries have because it uses a ''worldwide'' approach that imposes taxes on profits of American companies regardless of where those profits are earned. European corporations are subjected to a ''territorial'' tax system that does not tax profits on foreign operations.
 But in practice, the Joint Committee on Taxation said, American corporations almost permanently defer their taxes by keeping money outside the United States in low-tax countries like Ireland or India.
 ''By maintaining deferral indefinitely, a taxpayer can achieve a result that is economically equivalent to 100 percent exemption of income,'' the report said, referring to a company's foreign income.
 The problem of taxing foreign corporate profits has been the subject of intense political battles for many years. During his campaign to unseat President Bush, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts proposed giving American companies a one-time opportunity to bring their accumulated foreign profits back to the United States at a fraction of the normal corporate tax rate, which is 35 percent. In exchange, he proposed abolishing the practice of letting companies defer their United States taxes in the future.
 The Republican-led Congress took a different tack. It gave corporations the one-time tax break on foreign profits, estimated by J.P. Morgan Chase to total about $418 billion, but it allowed companies to keep deferring taxes in the future.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, welcomed the recommendations but made it clear he did not support all of them.
 ''Today's report will get the Finance Committee's attention,'' Mr. Grassley said in a written statement. But he added, ''While we won't embrace every recommendation, we'll give the report a close look.''

HEADLINE: The Market Shall Set You Free

BYLINE: By Robert Wright. 
Robert Wright, a fellow at Princeton University's Center for Human Values and at the New America Foundation, is the author of ''Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny.''

DATELINE: Princeton, N.J. 

 BODY:
LAST week President Bush again laid out a faith-based view of the world and again took heat for it. Human history, the president said in his inaugural address, ''has a visible direction, set by liberty and the author of liberty.'' Accordingly, America will pursue ''the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world'' -- and Mr. Bush has ''complete confidence'' of success. Critics on the left and right warned against grounding foreign policy in such naive optimism (a world without tyrants?) and such unbounded faith.
 But the problem with the speech is actually the opposite. Mr. Bush has too little hope, and too little faith. He underestimates the impetus behind freedom and so doesn't see how powerfully it imparts a ''visible direction'' to history. This lack of faith helps explain some of his biggest foreign policy failures and suggests that there are more to come. 
 Oddly, the underlying problem is that this Republican president doesn't appreciate free markets. Mr. Bush doesn't see how capitalism helps drive history toward freedom via an algorithm that for all we know is divinely designed and is in any event awesomely elegant. Namely: Capitalism's pre-eminence as a wealth generator means that every tyrant has to either embrace free markets or fall slowly into economic oblivion; but for markets to work, citizens need access to information technology and the freedom to use it -- and that means having political power. 
 This link between economic and political liberty has been extolled by conservative thinkers for centuries, but the microelectronic age has strengthened it. Even China's deftly capitalist-yet-authoritarian government -- which embraces technology while blocking Web sites and censoring chat groups -- is doomed to fail in the long run. China is increasingly porous to news and ideas, and its high-tech political ferment goes beyond online debates. Last year a government official treated a blue-collar worker high-handedly in a sidewalk encounter and set off a riot -- after news of the incident spread by cell phones and text messaging. 
 You won't hear much about such progress from neoconservatives, who prefer to stress how desperately the global fight for freedom needs American power behind it (and who last week raved about an inaugural speech that vowed to furnish this power). And, to be sure, neoconservatives can rightly point to lots of oppression and brutality in China and elsewhere -- as can liberal human-rights activists. But anyone who talks as if Chinese freedom hasn't grown since China went capitalist is evincing a hazy historical memory and, however obliquely, is abetting war. Right-wing hawks thrive on depicting tyranny as a force of nature, when in fact nature is working toward its demise.
 The president said last week that military force isn't the principal lever he would use to punish tyrants. But that mainly leaves economic levers, like sanctions and exclusion from the World Trade Organization. Given that involvement in the larger capitalist world is time-release poison for tyranny, impeding this involvement is an odd way to aid history's march toward freedom. Four decades of economic isolation have transformed Fidel Castro from a young, fiery dictator into an old, fiery dictator. 
 Economic exclusion is especially perverse in cases where inclusion could work as a carrot. Suppose, for example, that a malignant authoritarian regime was developing nuclear weapons and you might stop it by offering membership in the W.T.O. It's a twofer -- you draw tyrants into a web of commerce that will ultimately spell their doom, and they pay for the privilege by disarming. What president could resist that?
 Correct! President Bush is sitting on the sidelines scowling as the European Union tries to strike that very bargain with Iran. 
 It's possible that skepticism about the European initiative is justified -- that Iran, in the end, would rather have the bomb than a seat in the W.T.O. But there's one way for the Bush administration to find out: Outline a highly intrusive arms inspection regime and say that the United States will support W.T.O. membership if the inspectors find no weapons program (or if Iran fesses up) and are allowed to set up long-term monitoring. 
 There are various explanations for Mr. Bush's position. Maybe some in the administration fear losing a rationale for invading Iran. Maybe the administration is ideologically opposed to arms control agreements (a strange position, post-9/11). But part of the problem seems to be that Mr. Bush doesn't grasp the liberating power of capitalism, the lethal effect of luring authoritarian regimes into the modern world of free markets and free minds. 
 That would help explain the amazing four-year paralysis of America's North Korea policy. Reluctant to invade, yet allergic to ''rewarding'' tyrants with economic incentives and international engagement, the president sat by while North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, apparently built up a nuclear arsenal. Now, with Iran no more than a few years from having the bomb, we're watching this movie again. And it may be a double feature: the inertia we saw in North Korea followed by the war we've seen in Iraq. With Iraq and Iran in flames (live, on Al Jazeera!) and Mr. Kim coolly stockpiling nukes, President Bush will have hit the axis-of-evil trifecta.
 Pundits have mined Mr. Bush's inaugural address for literary antecedents -- Kennedy here, Lincoln there, a trace of Truman. But some of it was pure Bill Clinton. Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton said that history was on freedom's side and stressed that freedom abroad serves America's interests. But he also saw -- and explicitly articulated -- something absent from Mr. Bush's inaugural vision: the tight link between economic and political liberty in the information age, the essentially redeeming effect of globalization. That's one reason Mr. Clinton defied intraparty opposition to keep commerce with China and other nations strong. 
 In the wake of John Kerry's defeat, Democrats have been searching for a new foreign policy vision. But Mr. Clinton laid down as solid a template for post-9/11 policy as you could expect from a pre-9/11 president.
 First, fight the spread of weapons of mass destruction, which means, among other things, making arms inspections innovatively intrusive, as in the landmark Chemical Weapons Convention that President Clinton signed (and that Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, et. al., opposed). Second, pursue terrorist networks overtly and covertly (something Mr. Clinton did more aggressively than the pre-9/11 Bush administration). Third, make America liked and respected abroad (as opposed to, say, loathed and reviled). Fourth, seek lasting peace in the Middle East (something Mr. Bush keeps putting off until after the next war). 
 And finally, help the world mature into a comprehensive community of nations -- bound by economic interdependence and a commitment to liberty, and cooperating in the global struggle against terrorism and in law enforcement generally.
 But in pursuing that last goal, respect and harness the forces in your favor. Give history some guidance, but resist the flattering delusion that you're its pilot. Don't take military and economic weapons off the table, but appreciate how sparingly you can use them when the architect of history is on your side. Have a little faith.

HEADLINE: For Rice, Job Begins With Plans to Visit Europe and Israel

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Condoleezza Rice, greeted by warm applause as she arrived for her first full day as secretary of state, declared Thursday that diplomacy would be the main tool in spreading democracy in the world, and she announced plans to travel to Israel and to eight nations in Europe beginning next week.
 ''The president has set forth a really bold agenda for American foreign policy,'' Ms. Rice said, standing on a staircase in the lobby of the department. ''And the State Department has got to be in the lead in this period in which diplomacy will be so important to solidifying the gains of the last few years and to pressing forward an agenda for a freer and more prosperous world.'' 
 Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said Ms. Rice's main purpose on her trip would be to pave the way for President Bush's own visit to Europe, the first one planned for his new term, from Feb. 22 to 25. The main focus of Ms. Rice's attention, Mr. Boucher said, would be the Arab-Israeli situation, Iraq and support for democracy in the Middle East.
 In Israel, he said, Ms. Rice would meet with Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and would probably also meet with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his team.
 Administration officials say that there has been considerable progress in recent days in discussions between Mr. Sharon's government and Mahmoud Abbas, the newly elected Palestinian president, and that Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice were determined to take advantage of the momentum.
 ''The opportunity exists to move forward, but success remains an uncertain proposition,'' said David M. Satterfield, deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, speaking at the government-financed United States Institute of Peace. He called on both Israel and the Palestinians to take steps to ensure that progress is made. 
 Mr. Boucher said Ms. Rice's trip to Europe was part of a renewed Bush administration effort to find common ground on a range of policies and to move beyond the disputes that have surrounded the Iraq war over the last two years. Ms. Rice will visit Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Turkey, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg.
 But European and American officials said in interviews on Thursday that despite conciliatory public pronouncements on both sides of the Atlantic, and a determination to deepen cooperation on a number of subjects, there were still deep differences on subjects like Iran and Iraq.
 The officials said that after a period of cooperation on Iran, where Europeans have taken the lead in trying to get Tehran to give up its suspected nuclear weapons program, a series of American statements in the news had rattled European public opinion. 
 There was considerable news coverage, for instance, of a comment by Vice President Dick Cheney that if Iran developed nuclear weapons, Israel might strike pre-emptively. In Europe, the comment was seen as provocative and also a warning to the Europeans to redouble their efforts to negotiate with Tehran.
 President Bush's Inaugural Address proclaimed his determination to push for freedom throughout the world -- though not ''primarily'' by force of arms -- and did not particularly reassure Europeans that the United States had ruled out the further use of force, particularly on the Iranian situation.
 Europe has been pressing for more American involvement in the offering of economic incentives and political recognition to Tehran. In return, Iran would be expected to agree to implement a pledge to stop its program of enriching uranium and taking other steps that the West suspects are aimed at making arms.
 ''The American attitude toward Europe is, 'We wish you well with your effort, but we can't support it in an active way, because we don't want to legitimize this regime,''' said a senior European diplomat. ''It's, 'Hey you guys, you're on your own.' But sooner or later, that attitude is going to have to change.''
 Another senior European diplomat who visited recently with Ms. Rice and other top administration officials said there was also a worry in Europe that the United States would not actively urge Israel to meet the latest moves by Palestinian leaders with steps of its own to ease tensions.
 Also on Ms. Rice's agenda in Europe, administration officials said, was the discussion of democratic reforms in what is called the ''broader'' Middle East, including Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 The next meeting on such reforms is to be held in Egypt in March, with Afghanistan and Pakistan excluded at Egypt's request. An Arab diplomat said Egypt regarded these countries as non-Arab countries and as ''failed states'' and did not want them included in discussions of reforms in the Arab world.
 ''Condi Rice has a lot of capital, to use a Bush term,'' said one of the European diplomats. ''Our patience will be short. If we hear that it's business as usual, then I would expect frustration levels to go back to high rather quickly. But at the moment, the mood is one of maybe artificial optimism, but optimism.''

HEADLINE: America's Promises

 BODY:
Three years ago, President Bush created the Millennium Challenge Account to give more money to poor countries that are committed to policies promoting development. Mr. Bush said his government would donate billions in incremental stages until the program got to a high of $5 billion a year starting in 2006. While $5 billion is just 0.04 percent of America's national income, President Bush touted the proposal as proof that he cares about poverty in Africa and elsewhere. ''I carry this commitment in my soul,'' the president said. 
 For the third straight year, Mr. Bush has committed a lot less than he promised. Michael Phillips of The Wall Street Journal reports that the White House has quietly informed the managers of the Millennium Challenge Account to expect about $3 billion in the next budget. This follows a sad pattern. Mr. Bush said he would ask Congress for $1.7 billion in 2004; he asked for $1.3 billion and got $1 billion. He said he would ask for $3.3 billion in 2005; he asked for $2.5 billion and got $1.5 billion. 
 So if past is prologue, the Republican Congress will cut the diluted 2006 pledge even further. 
 None of that appears to bother the Bush administration, which continues to send high-ranking officials into the world to promote the anemic Millennium Challenge Account to poor nations. The program -- not the money, since the account has yet to pay out a single dollar -- is high on the list of talking points for cabinet officials like the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, who visited Africa in December and cited the program every chance he got. Speaking to Latin American ambassadors in Washington this month, a Treasury under secretary, John Taylor, hailed it as a ''major way in which we are working with countries to meet the challenge of increasing productivity growth.'' 
 Officials at the Millennium Challenge Account are quick to list the countries that, through good governance, have qualified for the aid program. They are not as quick to list the countries that have received a dime: there aren't any. Still, Paul Applegarth, chief executive of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, assured us last week that President Bush's program is ''really moving at an extraordinarily quick pace.''
 Maybe the administration should tell that to the 300 million Africans who lack safe drinking water, or the 3,000 African children under the age of 5 who die every day from malaria, or the 1 in 16 African women who die in childbirth, or the 6,000 Africans who die each day of AIDS. But wait. Maybe the president is planning to deal with the African AIDS catastrophe through his 2003 proposal to increase AIDS funds by $10 billion over the following five years?
 Not unless he is planning to finish with a bang, because the White House is expected to ask Congress for only $1.6 billion more next year. When added to the amount that AIDS funds increased in 2004 and 2005, that would leave a whopping more than $6 billion to get out of Congress in the next two years to meet Mr. Bush's pledge. Congress and Mr. Bush will point to the ballooning deficit and say they don't have the money. But that was a matter of choice. They chose to spend billions on tax cuts for the wealthy and the war in Iraq. They can choose to spend it instead to keep America's promises.

HEADLINE: Toilet Paper? Ask the Jets

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In a lot of ways New York is a wonderful city. For my money, it's the greatest. But like most American cities, it's weathering fiscal hard times. Despite Mayor Michael Bloomberg's upbeat tone at yesterday's budget presentation, it's a city that can't afford its share of the basic upkeep for its schools, its libraries, its day care centers and so forth.
 It's a city of some eight million people that dangerously shortchanges its Fire Department because money is hard to come by. It's a city that has been unable, due to budget constraints, to reach contract agreements with crucial city employees, including firefighters, police officers and teachers. 
 In short, it's tapped out. Over the past couple of years the city has relied more and more on corporations, wealthy individuals and foundations to pay for municipal services and functions that the city can no longer afford to provide.
 The mayor proposed more than a half-billion dollars in budget cuts yesterday as part of an array of proposals (some of them fanciful) to close a budget gap of about $1.5 billion. This is an election-year budget. You can bet heavily that next year's budget will be worse.
 New York State is in worse fiscal shape than the city. Much worse, actually. For one thing, Mayor Bloomberg has been far more responsible when it comes to fiscal matters than Gov. George Pataki, who seems to have studied at the George W. Bush School of Economics. 
 The state, for example, has the primary responsibility for financing local school systems. But the governor and other state officials, already faced with daunting deficits, are clueless about how to comply with a court order to come up with billions of dollars in additional state aid for New York City's chronically underfinanced schools. 
 Gambling has been one of the governor's favorite strategies for raising school funds. For the longest time he has promoted the idea of bolstering school aid through the use of video lottery terminals -- a wretchedly destructive little system known to its detractors as video crack.
 The point here is that neither the city nor the state has a dime to spare. Subway lines are falling apart because 19th-century signal systems have been neither upgraded nor protected. Plans for critically needed school construction are being deferred. After-school programs, which are literally lifelines for many youngsters, have to be shut down because they are not ''affordable.''
 And yet. Ah, yes. If there's one thing in this unhappy fiscal environment that Mayor Bloomberg will absolutely go to the mat for (carrying along the governor and any other powerful figures he can muster), it's that football stadium for his fellow billionaire, Robert Wood Johnson IV, owner of the New York Jets.
 At $1.4 billion, this playground for the richest among us would be the most expensive sports stadium in the history of the world. The city and the state, which can't afford toilet paper for the public schools, would put up a minimum of $600 million and undoubtedly much more. The smart money says the public will take at least a billion-dollar hit on this project so Woody Johnson can hold court amid a sea of luxury boxes hard by the Hudson on the Far West Side of Manhattan.
 How foolish is this project? They're planning to build a 75,000-seat stadium without any parking facilities to go along with it. Can you imagine what the West Side will look like on a game day? (The mayor's people got into a snit last October when officials in New Jersey wouldn't let Hizzoner land his helicopter at the Jets' current home in the New Jersey Meadowlands. He wanted to arrive too close to game time, the officials said. They suggested he come by bus.)
 If you're not rich and you don't already have season tickets to Jets games, you will have very little chance of ever seeing the team in its new digs. The waiting list for tickets is 10 years.
 But if there's any justice at all, this stadium will never see the light of day. To take the public's money, which should be used for schoolkids, for subway riders, for hospital patients -- for any number of projects that might truly serve the public's interest -- and hand it over to a billionaire who will use it as seed money to further his already fabulous interests is obscene.
 I presume there will be naming rights for Woody's wonderful new playground. I can see the sign now: Bloomberg's Boondoggle.

HEADLINE: Pressure Grows for Rich Nations To Redouble Effort to Aid Africa

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
After decades languishing as the last item on the global agenda, seeming helpless to stem its own decline, Africa is poised this year for what the rock star Bono called ''its moment.'' 
 At the World Economic Forum here, an American billionaire, a former American president, a British prime minister, two African presidents and Bono himself took to the stage Thursday to press the world to provide the money and the will to reverse the continent's slide. 
 If their entreaties to an assembly of more than 2,000 of the world's rich and powerful people had a loud subtext, though, it was that the Bush administration would come under mounting pressure to underpin an effort to give Africa a new lift. 
 ''The United States needs to move further up the table'' of aid donors as listed by the proportion of their overall wealth, Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, told a news conference. 
 Mr. Gates, who has just announced a $750 million gift to help poor children gain access to vaccines, spoke shortly before he, Bono and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain joined Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and former President Bill Clinton at a public session that ranked as one of the heavyweight events here.
 For as long as it has been in decline, of course, much of Africa has been the object of earnest debate and hand-wringing, even as other regions of the world once known for their poverty have begun to find niches in the global economy. 
 ''If what was happening in Africa happened in any other part of the world there would be such a scandal and clamor,'' said Mr. Blair, who has pledged to use his leadership of the Group of 8 industrialized nations and Britain's coming presidency of the European Union to push the issue. 
 The world response, he said, should be increased aid, efforts to end African conflicts, moves to end official corruption and tyranny and enhanced campaigns against deadly diseases like AIDS and malaria. 
 Those themes are familiar, but Westerners are hoping that African leaders will take charge of their destiny after a history of colonialism and cold war division that left the continent in thrall to outsiders.
 In changing some of its institutions to deal with its own social and economic problems, President Obasanjo said, African leaders have shown that ''we want to help ourselves.'' But, he said, there is not enough aid to deal with the lack of food, jobs, schools and health care. 
 ''We are getting aid when we have flood, disaster,'' he said. ''We are not getting the critical mass of funds to make development possible.'' 
 The issue is as much how to raise new money as how to ensure it is well spent at a time when Western governments are preoccupied with matters like the war in Iraq and nuclear policy in Iran and as disasters like the Asian tsunami threaten to divert aid from Africa.
 Moreover, Mr. Clinton said, while America's business and political elite are beginning to pay more attention to Africa, ''it is never a voting issue'' that politicians see as likely to determine an election.

HEADLINE: PROCTER CLOSES $57 BILLION DEAL TO BUY GILLETTE

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and STEVE LOHR; Eric Dash contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, reached an agreement yesterday to acquire the Gillette Company, the shaving-products and battery maker, for about $57 billion in stock, the companies said last night.
 The merger, which is subject to approval by regulators, would create a consumer-products powerhouse, combining some of the world's best-known brands like Procter's Tide, Crest and Pampers with Gillette's razors and blades, Right Guard deodorant and Duracell. The combined company would have sales of more than $60 billion a year.
 The agreement, which the boards of both companies approved late yesterday, will be announced today at a news conference in Midtown Manhattan, executives close to the deal said last night. 
 The friendly transaction reflects just how much the balance of power has shifted from consumer-products makers to giant discount retailers, mainly Wal-Mart, in recent years. 
 The move is a bid by two venerable consumer-products giants to strengthen their bargaining position with the likes of Wal-Mart and Aldi in Europe, which can now squeeze even the largest suppliers for lower prices. In addition, both companies have faced growing pressure on profits from private labels as consumers have become more price-conscious and less brand-conscious. 
 The combined company, analysts say, will also have more power in its negotiations with media companies -- television, magazines, newspapers and billboards -- to buy billions of dollars a year in advertising. Last year, Procter spent $5.5 billion on advertising.
 Both Gillette, based in Boston, and Procter, based in Cincinnati, have started down this road at least once before. Five years ago, when Procter's sales were temporarily stagnating as new products floundered, Durk Jager, then the chief executive, broached the possibility of a merger with Gillette executives and was rebuffed. In the current round of talks, the overture came from Gillette. In December, James M. Kilts, Gillette's chief executive, approached Procter, according to executives close to the negotiations. Mr. Kilts will become the vice chairman of the combined company and will have a seat on the board, the companies said. Alan G. Lafley, the chief executive of Procter, will continue in that position.
 The Procter-Gillette merger would be the largest acquisition in the nation since J.P. Morgan Chase acquired Bank One for $60 billion last year and it is the latest in a raft of mergers in the last several months that have swept across corporate America as boardroom confidence has surged.
 Last month was the busiest December in history, with a total of $283.7 billion in mergers and acquisitions worldwide, outpacing the deal volume in December 1999, at the height of the stock market bubble and merger mania, according to Thomson Financial. 
 Last month, Sprint agreed to buy Nextel Communications for $35 billion; Johnson & Johnson made a deal to acquire Guidant for $25 billion; Symantec agreed to buy Veritas for $13.5 billion; PeopleSoft finally capitulated to Oracle's $10.3 billion offer; and I.B.M. sold its personal computer business to Lenovo of China for $1.75 billion. And this week, SBC Communications is negotiating to buy AT&T, according to executives close to the deal.
 Regulators are expected to look closely at the Gillette-Procter merger and could force Procter to divest itself of some businesses that overlap with Gillette's. The greatest overlaps are in the deodorant and oral health care segments. In deodorants, Procter owns Old Spice and Gillette owns Right Guard; in oral health, Procter owns Crest toothpaste and Gillette owns Oral-B.
 The planned merger, management specialists say, combines two companies in similar markets requiring complementary skills. 
 ''These are companies with storied brands that work the same distribution channels,'' said Eric Greenberg, an independent management consultant in New York. ''This sounds like a very viable merger; they are sticking to their knitting.''
 Over the years, major investors have regarded Gillette as a company with an enviable stable of brands with the potential to become even more lucrative. In the late 1990's, the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company took a large holding in Gillette, but sold its shares after Gillette's profits slipped in 1999. 
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc., controlled by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, has long been Gillette's largest investor. That patience, it seems, will now be rewarded since the Procter offer is an 18 percent premium over Gillette's share price.
 ''It's a dream deal,'' Mr. Buffett said in a statement. He said that he intended to increase his holdings to 100 million shares in the combined company. Berkshire Hathaway currently holds 96 million shares of Gillette, or 9.67 percent of the company.
 Shares of Procter closed down 12 cents yesterday at $55.32; Gillette shares closed up 85 cents, at $45.85. 
 Procter apparently also sees untapped potential in Gillette, as its products can now be pushed hard by Procter's renowned marketers, both in the United States and abroad. Procter, in particular, sees great opportunity abroad. 
 In a conference call last month, Procter executives said the total market in developing countries for its lines of consumer goods would reach nearly $100 billion by 2010. 
 ''For our top brands, there are still lots of markets where we don't compete,'' Robert A. McDonald, vice chairman for global operations, said in the conference call.
 In talks leading up to the merger, Procter and Gillette executives say they have also identified more strategic advantages than merely the greater size, buying power and efficiencies from combining two similar enterprises. 
 In many ways, they say, the companies have complementary skills. Procter's executives regard their company as a master at marketing to women, given its long history in household, hygiene and food products. Gillette, whose name is synonymous with shaving for millions of men, sees itself as an expert in the male market.
 In addition, Procter has established a strong sales network in fast-growing foreign markets like China and Russia, while Gillette has not. Tapping that distribution network, the executives say, should lift Gillette's worldwide sales at little added cost to the combined enterprise.
 Indeed, executives of the two companies have identified $14 billion to $16 billion in annual benefits from the merger, a total that includes the gains from a stronger bargaining position with retailers and media companies, cost-cutting and anticipated additional revenues. Combining the companies is expected to lead to about 6,000 job cuts, or about 4 percent of the work force. Procter has 110,000 employees and Gillette has 29,400 workers. 
 Under the terms of the deal, Procter will pay 0.975 share, or about $54, for each share of Gillette. That is about an 18 percent premium over Gillette's shares. After the deal is completed, Procter intends to buy back $18 billion to $20 billion worth of stock from the combined company, the companies said in a joint statement. That would have the effect of making the acquisition a 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash deal.
 Procter & Gamble reported second-quarter earnings yesterday that rose 12 percent. Net income was $2.04 billion, compared with $1.82 billion a year earlier. Sales in the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, rose 9.3 percent, to $14.45 billion. 
 In October, Gillette reported earnings of $475 million in the third quarter, compared with $416 million last year. Over all, Gillette's quarterly sales reached $2.69 billion, up from $2.4 billion the year before.
 Gillette was advised by UBS and Goldman Sachs and received legal counsel from Davis Polk & Wardwell. Procter was advised by Merrill Lynch and received legal counsel from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.

PERSON: William O. Bailey

HEADLINE: William Bailey, 78, Dies; Advocate for Municipal Bonds

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
William O. Bailey, an insurance executive who helped attract investors to many public projects by persuading the insurance industry to guarantee municipal bonds, died yesterday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan and Moultonborough, N.H. 
 The cause was pneumonia, his wife, Carole, said. 
 As a senior executive at the Aetna Life and Casualty Company in the 1970's, Mr. Bailey enlisted four other firms to jointly offer state and local governments insurance that would guarantee the repayment of money lent to them by investors. Because such municipal bond issues often amounted to nearly $100 million, insuring them was too expensive for any one company. 
 By reducing the risk to investors, the Municipal Bond Insurance Association, started in 1973, allowed municipalities to borrow money from the public at lower interest rates. While still at Aetna, Mr. Bailey became the first president of the association and later the chairman of MBIA Inc., a separate, publicly traded company that took over the association's business in 1987.
 MBIA has helped back the construction of Denver International Airport and insured Orange County's ''recovery bonds'' after its fiscal crisis, among other deals. 
 It also helped create an industry that has insured more than $2 trillion in municipal and asset-backed securities, according to the Association of Financial Guaranty Insurers, the industry's trade group. 
 The association also estimates that municipal bond guarantors have saved taxpayers $35 billion in interest that they would have paid on uninsured bonds.
 At Aetna, now primarily a health insurer, Mr. Bailey was president and chief operating officer from 1976 to 1987 and vice chairman from 1987 to 1988. 
 ''Under his leadership, Aetna grew to become the nation's largest shareholder-owned insurance organization,'' Aetna's chairman and chief executive, John W. Rowe, said in a statement. 
 Often a spokesman and leader of the industry, he advocated tort reform, coordinated a bailout of the car insurer Geico in 1975, and persuaded several insurers to underwrite the makers of swine flu vaccine, who were otherwise reluctant to produce it for widespread distribution. 
 He was chairman of the American Insurance Association, the Health Insurance Association of America and the Property Casualty Insurance Council. 
 William Olliver Bailey was born in Syracuse on July 1, 1926. He served in the Navy during World War II and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1947. He received a business degree in insurance from the Wharton School in 1949. 
 In addition to his wife, Carole Parsons Bailey, he is survived by a son, George, of Northampton, Mass.; two daughters, Janet Faude, of West Hartford, Conn., and Carolyn Bailey, of Lexington, Mass.; and six grandchildren. Two sons, John Mason and Thomas Wood, died before him.

HEADLINE: A Rich State in Bolivia Moves Toward More Autonomy

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
Leaders of the affluent eastern state of Santa Cruz, which functions as Bolivia's economic engine, claimed an important victory in their fight for regional autonomy on Friday, naming a provisional assembly to prepare the legal framework for greater independence. 
 The movement for autonomy, which grew out of public protests this month against a government increase in fuel prices, is the latest crisis to strike the chronically weak government of President Carlos Mesa.
 Hoping to end protests since it raised government-subsidized diesel prices on Dec. 30, Mr. Mesa's government has acceded to two main demands from pro-autonomy leaders. One lets voters elect the state's highest official, the prefect, whom the president currently appoints. The other advances to June a binding referendum asking residents if they want autonomy, a vote that is likely to pass. 
 Though he did not rescind the fuel price increase, as leaders here had demanded, Mr. Mesa did slightly lower it. By late Friday afternoon, tens of thousands of people had gathered to celebrate.
 ''We feel satisfied because we have fulfilled the people's wishes,'' said Carlos Dabdoub, a neurosurgeon and former health minister who is a leader of the autonomy movement. ''Today we have a historic victory and the defeat of a centralist state.''
 The government's softened stance has, for now, defused what had become the most serious crisis in the 15-month presidency of Mr. Mesa, a journalist who has struggled to placate the nationalistic, antiglobalization indigenous majority in the highlands and the pro-capitalist leaders here in lowland Santa Cruz state. 
 But some political analysts warned that by giving in, Mr. Mesa would embolden both the leaders of Santa Cruz, who want more regional independence, and the leaders of the indigenous population, who are demanding that the government nationalize foreign firms and scale back market reforms.
 ''It's a government that has ceded to all pressure,'' said Alvaro Garcia, a sociologist in La Paz, the capital, who has advised the country's most formidable indigenous leader, Evo Morales. ''It's a government just interested in surviving, and so it reacts to pressure. That's dangerous.''
 The delicate balancing act -- coming after Mr. Mesa's immediate predecessor, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, was forced out amid violent protests in October 2003 -- may yet fail. The possibility that Mr. Mesa's fragile government will collapse is alarming to the United States, which worries that chaos here will mean a revitalized drug trade, and to other Andean countries, which have also been rocked by violent antiglobalization protests in recent years.
 Mr. Mesa's latest concession came after he raised the price of diesel fuel by 23 percent and of gasoline by 10 percent, inciting strikes in the largely indigenous city of El Alto. Mr. Mesa responded by reducing the increases and canceling a government contract with a French water utility that was unpopular in El Alto. 
 But Santa Cruz residents were not mollified. They stepped up their own strikes to protest the fuel increases, with an eye toward a greater prize: forcing the government to speed up efforts leading to political and fiscal autonomy.
 ''We don't believe in the central government,'' explained Branko Marinkovic, general manager of a family-run conglomerate and leader of a federation of entrepreneurs.
 So far, by negotiating with Bolivia's divergent and dogmatic political groups, Mr. Mesa has managed to keep violence to a minimum and hold his country together. He remains popular, having placated the country's most determined antiglobalization forces by pushing a referendum last year that may lead to laws giving the government more control of the oil and gas industry. 
 But Eduardo Gamarra, the Bolivian-born director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University in Miami, said Mr. Mesa remained chronically weak and unable to make hard decisions. With few allies in the Bolivian Congress, and no strong influence over the security forces, Mr. Mesa's government has looked increasingly paralyzed, Mr. Gamarra said.
 ''He waits until things get so bad because he doesn't want to use force and he doesn't want to insult anybody,'' said Mr. Gamarra, who speaks to Mr. Mesa from time to time. ''Then he is pushed into a corner and he gives in to them.''
 After Mr. Mesa's concession to Santa Cruz state, civic committees in the states of La Paz, Cochabamba, Oruro and Potosi, all with large indigenous Indian communities, have filed proposals for direct elections so they can choose state officials who are now appointed. Meanwhile, groups opposed to autonomy or allied with coca-growing organizations have promised to step up protests.
 Here in this city of 1.4 million on the edge of the Amazon, anger against Mr. Mesa has mounted, and civic leaders have watched with concern as restive Indian groups have won one political battle after another, making the indigenous majority a formidable force. 
 Some say they believe that in appeasing his opponents, Mr. Mesa has swayed so far to the left that Bolivia is headed toward economic ruin.
 ''They are openly communist people,'' Mr. Marinkovic said, referring to members of Mr. Mesa's administration. ''That's how you start, moving slowly. You don't do Bolshevik revolutions. You do it little by little.''
 While at least publicly many here would disagree with that assessment, Santa Cruz's businessmen say they fear that the left-leaning indigenous movements could, in time, take over in Bolivia. 
 That feeling has propelled Santa Cruz residents, known as Crucenos, to seek greater control over the state's finances and government, a crucial step because Santa Cruz is underrepresented in Congress.
 The road to autonomy will still be long and complicated, because rules governing taxes and spending will have to be changed. However, the current prefect, Carlos Hugo Molina, recognized Santa Cruz's new direction by resigning Thursday. 
 ''I do not want to be an obstacle,'' he said at a news conference.

HEADLINE: Growth Pace Of Economy Slowed to 3.1% In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The American economy slowed to an annual growth rate of 3.1 percent in the final three months of 2004, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That was the weakest quarterly pace in nearly two years, held down by a surge in imports, which substituted for production at home.
 Consumers provided most of the lift, increasing their outlays for goods and services by more than enough to offset weaknesses in other areas. They spent most heavily on food and medical care, with home furnishings, home maintenance and motor vehicles not far behind. 
 ''Spending was solid enough,'' said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, ''but a lot of that spending was for imports. To me it says we are spending a lot and foreigners are continuing to eat our lunch.''
 The fourth-quarter performance of the gross domestic product was the worst of the year -- nearly a percentage point below the 4 percent growth rate in the third quarter and the smallest rise since the first quarter of 2003. 
 But some forecasters predicted that economic growth would soon rebound, to an annual rate of at least 3.5 percent -- mostly on the strength of consumer spending -- and the Federal Reserve, in response, would continue its pattern of quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate. The funds rate influences the cost of mortgages, car loans and other consumer and business borrowing. 
 ''We expect the Fed to tighten by a quarter of a point at each of the first four meetings of its policy makers this year,'' said Kenneth J. Matheny, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. With two more quarter-point increases in the second half, ''we expect the funds rate to hit 3.75 percent by December,'' he said. The rate now is 2.25 percent.
 Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight of Lexington, Mass, is not so sure. ''The higher rates go,'' Mr. Gault said, ''the more confident the Fed will have to be to keep on raising rates meeting after meeting. And this latest report is hardly stellar.'' By the measure used by most economists, gross domestic product, at nearly $11 trillion adjusted for inflation, was 3.7 percent higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the 2003 quarter. 
 That was not as good a performance as in the 12 months from the fourth quarter of 2002 to the fourth quarter of 2003. By another measure, however, one that takes average growth for 2004 and compares it with the average for 2003, last year's increase was 4.4 percent, the largest year-over-year rise since 1999. 
 The Bush administration focused on the more optimistic measure. ''The addition of 2.3 million jobs and a solid year-over-year growth rate of 4.4 percent show the strength of the nation's economy,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said yesterday. 
 Gross domestic product measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States, including the value added in the marketing and retailing of imported products. The final number is calculated by adding together the value of all output, including the value of exported goods and services. From this number, the cost of imports is subtracted.
 The surge in imports, mostly consumer products and petroleum, produced a large subtraction in the fourth quarter. A drop in exports, particularly in the export of machinery and other capital goods, made matters worse. The overall swing reduced the G.D.P. in the fourth quarter by 1.73 percentage points, the largest drop since the spring quarter of 1998. 
 ''We are unlikely to get declines of this magnitude on a regular basis,'' Mr. Matheny said. The weakening dollar and growing prosperity abroad should raise the demand for American exports, he argued. 
 Until the fourth quarter, exports had risen for 15 consecutive months, although imports outpaced them and the trade deficit, as a result, has continued to grow. Some economists say the widening trade deficit could produce another quarter of weak economic growth this year, unless the dollar drops in value more than it has so far. 
 At the dollar's present level, ''importers have largely absorbed the impact in the form of lower profit margins,'' Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote in his analysis of the latest G.D.P. numbers.
 The strong consumer spending was for many economists the most encouraging news in yesterday's G.D.P. report. Personal consumption expenditures were up 4.6 percent, less than the third quarter's 5.1 percent rise, but ahead of increases in consumer spending in nearly every quarter over the last four years.
 Relatively low interest rates and mild inflation as well as rising household wealth in the form of higher stock prices and home values all contributed to the strong consumer spending, economists said. So did an increase in personal disposable income, although Microsoft made a significant contribution to that increase with a one-time dividend paid to shareholders last year, according to yesterday's G.D.P. report.
 Apart from consumer spending, noticeable contributions came from business investment and inventory accumulation. Wholesalers in particular increased their stockpiles of unsold merchandise, and business concentrated its spending on computers, software and other information-processing equipment.
 ''Basically I would characterize the investment numbers as strong in computers and software, but the outlays in other categories, including industrial equipment, mostly decelerated,'' said Brent Moulton, an associate director of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produces the quarterly reports. 
 That trend, if it continues, puts pressure on consumers to keep the economy percolating, and Mr. Gault for one questions whether they can do this very much longer on the strength of their borrowing and the rising value of their homes and stock portfolios. 
 ''At some point consumer spending has to come into line with income growth,'' he said, ''and in 2004 income did not rise as fast as spending.''

HEADLINE: An Argentine With Literary Roots in Singer and Roth

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
As a child, Marcelo Birmajer went each summer with his parents to Miramar, a beach resort that is for the Jews of Argentina what the Catskills once were for the Jews of New York. There, his father would tell stories about the people who paraded by as the family sat on the sand or, as dusk fell each day, relate the plot of whatever novel he happened to be reading.
 Today, Mr. Birmajer (pronounced BEER-mocker) is one of Argentina's most prolific and praised young writers of fiction. But he traces both the birth of his vocation and his desire to portray his country's Jewish community, at about 300,000 the largest in Latin America, back to those summer days and the simple fact that ''my father, an accountant for the state gas company, was a great storyteller.''
 At 38, Mr. Birmajer has already written more than 20 books, many focusing on life here in the Jewish barrio, known as El Once. The grandson of Romanian, Polish, Lithuanian and Syrian immigrants, he grew up in the neighborhood, which he describes as a fascinating blend of Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions, with Jews rich and poor, religious and secular, living side by side. 
 ''Not only was I born in Once, but the studio where I still write is there,'' he said in Spanish during an interview last month at the studio. ''It's a place that I prefer not just for reasons of class, but for metaphysical or mythical reasons as well. I like to just walk around and see the ebullience of commerce, the money changing hands, to eat in the Sephardic restaurants. It's the place that has the vitamins that allow me to write.''
 In one of his most recent depictions of Once and its inhabitants, Mr. Birmajer collaborated on the script for the movie ''Lost Embrace.'' [It opened in New York on Jan. 28.] A bittersweet comedy directed by Daniel Burman, the film won awards at festivals in Spain and Cuba for its script even before shooting began. At the Berlin International Film Festival last year, ''Lost Embrace'' won the Silver Bear for best film and its star, Daniel Hendler, was named best actor.
 Mr. Hendler plays Ariel Makaroff, who finds himself simultaneously dissatisfied with Argentina's ceaseless economic crises, his own love life and his job running a lingerie shop with his mother in a small mall. He seeks to emigrate, not to Israel, but to Europe, hoping to use the Polish passport to which he is entitled through his grandmother, who fled the Holocaust.
 ''Marcelo was a childhood friend of my older brother,'' said Mr. Burman, the film's director, who wrote the screenplay with Mr. Birmajer, ''and though I hadn't seen him in a long time, I had read his books and knew that we shared the same artistic universe. We are both fascinated with everyday life and believe that inside even the most ordinary-appearing person is an interesting story just waiting to be told.''
 A recurring character in Mr. Birmajer's fiction is Javier Mossen, a sexually voracious and sometimes repugnant journalist whom some regard as Mr. Birmajer's alter ego. In three acclaimed short story collections, together known as ''Stories of Married Men,'' Mossen manages to transform nearly every contact with a woman into an erotically charged encounter.
 In stories like ''An Interview With Kissinger,'' Mr. Birmajer also uses Mossen to comment humorously or satirically on the worlds of politics and journalism. Mr. Birmajer is ''one of several younger writers who have really moved in a nonconfrontational manner away from the baroque style of Garcia Marquez, Vargas Llosa and Fuentes,'' the translator Edith Grossman said. ''His is a more straightforward kind of narrative, something entirely different from the older generation.''
 In a country whose modern literary tradition is based largely on fabulists and experimentalists like Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortazar, critics do not seem to know quite what to make of Mr. Birmajer. So he often finds himself being compared to writers who are Jewish and American, ''a sort of Woody Allen of the Pampas'' and ''David Mamet in Spanish,'' as he has been described. And though Mr. Birmajer admits the importance of American Jewish writers and comedians like Bernard Malamud and Jerry Seinfeld in molding his work, he cites others as primary influences, including Philip Roth but especially Isaac Bashevis Singer.
 ''Even though by time and circumstance I am closer to Roth, if I had to choose a single master, without a doubt it would be Singer,'' he said. ''I am absolutely devoted to him, have all of his books and have translated some into Spanish. He is a disenchanted mystic and a seer, the son and grandson of rabbis who knows the Torah by heart but is won over by the profane, not the sacred.''
 Some of Mr. Birmajer's short stories and novels, including ''Being Human and Other Misfortunes'' and ''Not So Different,'' have recently been translated into German, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch. Thus far, though, none of his work has appeared in Hebrew, and only one of his short stories, titled ''A Christmas Carol,'' has been translated into English.
 In the story, Mossen, a nonobservant Jew, drifts from one Christmas Eve party to another here, hoping to find and seduce Raquel, a woman he has long lusted after. On the street, he rescues his Uncle Boris from a group of skinhead punks, only to have his Orthodox uncle reproach him for not practicing their faith.
 ''It's really a knockout, with that poignant, bittersweet quality you find in Yiddish writing,'' said Ms. Grossman, who did the translation, ''and brilliant in the way he finds a link between a failed love affair and what is going on in the streets.'' 
 Besides screenplays, Mr. Birmajer has also tried his hand at novels, children's books, essays, comic books, erotica, literary criticism and journalism. But he says his favorite literary form is the short story.
 ''What I like the most, is to sit around the fire, so to speak, and tell a story, like my father did when I was a kid,'' said Mr. Birmajer, who is married and has two children. ''The story of Solomon, of David, of Pesach, the Torah itself, all are stories with a beginning, middle and end. So all this stuff of postmodernism and literary experimentation and vanguards aren't worth a shekel to me. I never experiment with structure.''
 Though Mr. Birmajer has also written a pamphlet on ''Being Jewish in the 21st Century,'' he has never referred directly -- by design, he said -- to the 1994 bombing attack on a Jewish community center here, the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the world since World War II.
 Yet, he said, ''it is always present, in the form of an atmosphere in which something can always happen.''
 ''It is a theme that seems to me, like the Shoah, that you end up bastardizing if you take away its sacrosanct nature and use it as a theme for fiction,'' he said.
 As an Argentine who is Jewish, ''I have felt anti-Semitism all my life,'' Mr. Birmajer continued. ''But to the extent that I have been successful, Judaism has been one of the foundations of my career. It's a paradoxical situation: anti-Semitism exists here, but at the same time, this country is livable and quite sweet.''

HEADLINE: Where Crack Once Ruled, Construction Now Booms

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
From central Brooklyn to the South Bronx to the farthest corners of Staten Island, new homes in the city are being built in numbers not seen in a generation.
 In 2004, the city approved the construction of 25,208 housing units in New York City, more than in any year since 1972, according to newly released census figures. By comparison, in the last boom year of 1985, reflecting a successful housing program under the Koch administration, about 20,300 units were permitted; in 1994, however, there were 4,010. 
 This rapid growth, like most economic development trends in New York, stems in part from the policies of city government, but more importantly from the confidence of the private market, which is building and financing homes in neighborhoods best known 10 years ago for their brisk crack trade and overwhelming economic misery. 
 ''There has been development activity in places that would have been inconceivable 10 years ago,'' said Carol Abrams, the spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which works with developers to rehabilitate and develop housing. ''There has been the absolute transformation of the boroughs,'' Ms. Abrams said. ''New immigrants or longtime residents now want to plunk down their life savings for a place in Mott Haven or East New York.''
 The building spurt reflects a confluence of factors, including the city's rising population -- fueled in large part by immigrants who are willing to take a chance on underdeveloped areas that are no longer riddled with crime -- as well as the city's continual housing shortage and protracted low mortgage rates.
 ''The thing that is amazing is that everyone thinks of the real estate community in New York as Manhattan,'' said Shaun Donovan, the commissioner of the housing preservation department. ''And yet Manhattan is fourth out of the five boroughs in permits.'' 
 Driving this trend, Mr. Donovan said, is the tide of new immigrants and middle-class New Yorkers who are making a go in newly safe neighborhoods. ''During the 1990's, New York City added more people than live in entire cities in the United States,'' he said. ''Clearly the really unprecedented boom in immigration is driving a large part of the increase. But also people are staying who once might otherwise have moved out.'' 
 According to United States Census Bureau statistics released yesterday, Queens County leads the housing boom, with permits issued last year for 6,853 units. Brooklyn was just behind, at 6,825 permits. Even Staten Island, which has been fighting development in many neighborhoods, had 2,051 permits for homes, which will probably be developed over the next few years.
 In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a $3 billion plan to create tens of thousands of low- and middle-income housing units in New York City over five years, through both the repair and preservation of 38,000 units of existing housing and by building 27,000 new units in all five boroughs. His plan called for a complex financing deal in which the city's Housing Development Corporation would borrow against that agency's mortgage equity. 
 As of this year, 26,000 units have come under development, and his administration is offering a loan program in cooperation with four commercial banks to develop thousands more abandoned or decaying properties in the city.
 At the same time, developers around the city have found that there is a market for housing in many neighborhoods considered anathema a decade ago. 
 ''There has been a concerted effort on government's part to help finance housing,'' said Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''This is mostly true in poor neighborhoods, where they go in and other developers say, 'Aha, now there is an anchor!' and now the whole neighborhood improves.''
 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bloomberg administration officials credit the mayor with much of the boom.
 ''This mayor is responsible for the single largest housing boom this city has ever seen,'' said John Crotty, executive vice president of the Housing Development Corporation. ''The market is so hot right now there is no area that is bad for development. Developers have made investments in places where no private money would ever go into.'' 
 Last year the housing agency issued $1.1 billion in bonds to create and preserve new housing, the largest amount since the federal tax reform act of 1986, Mr. Crotty said.

HEADLINE: Shiite Faction Ready to Shun Election in Iraq

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
Less than 48 hours before nationwide elections here, Nasir al-Saedy, one of the city's most popular Shiite clerics, stood before a crowd of 20,000 Iraqis and uttered not a single word about the vote.
 Sheik Saedy spoke of faith, humility and the power of God. But about Sunday's elections, the first here in more than 30 years, nothing.
 For the throngs of Iraqis who had come to Al Mohsen Mosque to listen, the sheik's silence came through loud and clear. And it foreshadowed a less than overwhelming voter turnout in many parts of Iraq. 
 ''God willing, I will not be voting,'' Ziad Qadam, an unemployed 27-year-old, said after Friday Prayers at the mosque in Sadr City, the vast Shiite district in Baghdad. ''Our religious leaders have not told us to vote.''
 Sheik Saedy is an acolyte of Moktada al-Sadr, the rebel Shiite cleric, and his Friday sermon seemed to settle for good the question of Mr. Sadr's place in the country's new democratic order.
 Mr. Sadr, who led a series of uprisings against American forces last year, has sent conflicting signals about his political intentions. In the months since the Americans crushed his revolt, he quietly fielded a group of candidates for the national assembly, while telling his followers that he planned to boycott the vote.
 Mainstream Shiite leaders believe that for some months Mr. Sadr has been playing a double game -- backing political candidates on one hand, hinting at a boycott to his followers on the other -- as part of a calculated strategy to maximize his political influence.
 Until now, Iraq's mainstream Shiite leaders, who have been trying to coax Mr. Sadr and his vast following into the democratic process, had been hoping that he would finally tell his followers to give up their rebellion and turn to the ballot box.
 His silence, and that of his supporters like Sheik Saedy, signals that he had decided to hedge his bets against the election. He wants the benefits of being part of the democratic process, while publicly denouncing it for the followers who do not subscribe to it. 
 The reticence about Sunday's election in Mr. Sadr's Shiite mosque was echoed across town in a large Sunni mosque as well: Uum al Qura, headquarters of the Association of Muslim Scholars, the Sunni group that has also urged Iraqis to stay home on election day. There, the sermon went on about faith and responsibility, with not a word about the election.
 In some ways, the apathy of followers of Mr. Sadr is more worrisome to Iraqi leaders and American officials. Buoyed by the military defeat of his Mahdi Army over the summer, both were confident that he would move toward the political center. In sermons in mosques across Iraq, he has continuously mocked those expectations.
 Mr. Sadr, only 30, commands a huge following across the country, particularly in the Shiite slums of Basra and Baghdad. The Shiite electorate is thought to make up a majority of all voters in Iraq, and Shiite leaders hope that these voters, including Mr. Sadr's followers, will help propel them to political power here for the first time.
 Not even the urgings of the country's highest Shiite religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who declared that it was the religious duty of all Iraqis to vote, has appeared to move Mr. Sadr or his faithful.
 ''Ayatollah Sistani has his political statements, and we have our own,'' said Ahmed al-Kauai, a Sadr cleric who attended the sermon in Baghdad on Friday. ''We won't be voting.''
 Across Iraq, the subject of elections dominated sermons in many mosques, as violence aimed at disrupting the vote broke out as well. The Iraqi government and American forces stepped up their efforts to protect those Iraqis who will vote on Sunday. 
 Through the day, American jets roared overhead, standing by to attack insurgents. The first night of a three-night nationwide curfew began at 7 p.m., while Iraqi soldiers began sealing off main thoroughfares in many cities, hoping to hinder what is feared to be a new wave of car bombings.
 On Friday morning, a pair of suicide car bombings struck the Dura neighborhood in southern Baghdad. In the first, the police opened fire on the oncoming car, causing it to burst into flames, but the ensuing explosion killed four policemen. Later, a second car bomb exploded near a school that was to be used a polling place.
 Insurgents have begun bombing schools throughout the country, in anticipation of their being used as polling places. Guerrillas bombed three schools around Bejii, a Sunni-dominated town in northern Iraq, The Associated Press reported Friday.
 In Ramadi, American troops found the bodies of four Iraqi men, each shot through the head, who were believed to have been members of the Iraqi National Guard. Officials said it was unclear that the men were the same four who were kidnapped in the city the day before. The Americans found them splayed in the road in the neighborhood of Tamin, southwest of the city center.
 Iraqi leaders claimed a major success in their effort to break up the group led by the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. They said they had captured three senior members of Mr. Zarqawi's group, including Salah Suleiman al-Loheibi, described as the chief of its Baghdad operations.
 Qassim Daoud, minister of state for national security, told reporters that Mr. Loheibi had met with Mr. Zarqawi more than 40 times over the last three months. The two other men captured were Anad Muhammad Qais, described as Mr. Zarqawi's military adviser, and Ali Hamad Yassin al-Issawi.
 Barem Saleh, the deputy foreign minister, said his government was getting close to capturing or killing Mr. Zarqawi himself.
 ''We are getting close to finishing off al-Zarqawi, and we will get rid of him,'' Mr. Saleh told reporters.
 Mr. Zarqawi, who has taken responsibility for a number of bloody attacks on American forces and Iraqi civilians, has declared Iraq's democratic experiment an affront to Islam. In a message posted on the Internet this week, he warned Iraqis to stay away from polling places, calling them ''centers of atheism and vice.''
 Still, apart from the assurances of the Iraqi leaders, it was not immediately clear how important the suspected militants were, or whether their capture would slow down the insurgency. Iraqi leaders have claimed to have captured senior members of Mr. Zarqawi's ring before, and his murderous campaign has rolled on.
 Mr. Daoud said Mr. Loheibi and Mr. Issawi were both arrested in mid-January, raising the possibility that the government held off announcing the arrests until just before election, in hopes of persuading more Iraqis to go to the polls.
 Five American soldiers died today in three separate attacks, three when the convoy they were riding in struck a roadside bomb in western Baghdad. Another soldier was wounded in that attack.
 Insurgents have begun to use more sophisticated bombs against American vehicles; earlier this month, a roadside bomb killed 7 Americans who were riding in an armored personnel carrier.
 A roadside bomb killed another American soldier and wounded three others in southern Baghdad on Friday, and another American soldier was shot dead in the northern part of the city, the military said.
 The fate of two more American soldiers, the crew of a Kiowa helicopter that went down in southern Baghdad, was unknown, as was the cause of the crash. The crash of the Kiowa came two days after a Marine Super Stallion helicopter went down during a sandstorm at night in western Iraq, and all 31 troops aboard died.
 Even if the pending election was left out of the sermon at Al Mohsen Mosque, it filled other mosques around Baghdad on Friday, sometimes in surprising ways.
 At Bouratha Mosque in northern Baghdad, Sheik Jalal al-Sajhir, who is also a Shiite candidate for the national assembly, told his followers to go to vote Sunday no matter what their fears.
 ''The day of our victory will be Sunday,'' Sheik Sajhir told about 1,000 people assembled before him. ''We are going to show the terrorists that their car bombs are not stronger than our belief.''
 He urged Iraqi women to vote, and to overcome not just their fears of violence, but their husbands as well.
 ''Give your voice, even if your husbands refuse you,'' he said.
 Even some Sunni clerics urged their followers to go forward to the polls. Breaking with most of his fellow Sunni clerics, who have called for a boycott of the election, a cleric at one of the most anti-American mosques in the city told his followers to vote for the best candidate.
 ''The national assembly is going to happen,'' said Sheik Moayed al-Adami, imam at Abu Hanifa Mosque in the Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya, according to Agence France-Presse.
 Sheik Adami seemed to allude to the prospect of Shiite dominance, which, he suggested, could be countered only by voting. .
 ''Our rights have been damaged,'' he said. ''The elections must be of benefit to all and not to one group and or one party.''

HEADLINE: Saving the Subways

 BODY:
Lawrence Reuter was not a New York household name before last week. And he probably wishes that were still so. Mr. Reuter, president of New York City Transit, had his unhappy moment in the spotlight when he told the city that because of a fire, two major subway lines, the A and the C, would be out of commission for three to five years. As almost anyone but Mr. Reuter could have predicted, that set off panic in the neighborhoods where hundreds of thousands of people use the lines to get to work. He has since clarified his estimate to a matter of months and, we hope, learned a lesson in the importance of accurate communication with his customers.
 But there is a far larger and scarier issue facing the city's subways than public relations, and telling Mr. Reuter to fix it is useless. The problem must be placed squarely in the lap of the man with the power and the responsibility: Gov. George Pataki. 
 Years of underfinancing and borrowing have left the system on the threshold of a crisis bigger than anything since its nadir in the late 70's and early 80's. If the fire last week served any purpose, it was to remind the city how vulnerable its network of subways is to mishap or worse. The relay signals that burned and need replacing are Depression-era. Computerizing the whole system will be so costly and take so long that it seems more like a dream than a solution. The urgent challenge now is much more basic: to get the financing from Albany to save what we've got. 
 Like all too many things in New York, the regional mass transit system is organized in a way that makes it hard for the public to figure out who's really in charge. But it's a creation of the state, and run by officials answering to the governor. Mr. Pataki has always reduced his responsibility, although this year he did propose modest increases in vehicle fees and the mortgage recording tax to help pay the transit bills. It's simply not enough, particularly for a governor who denounces fare increases.
 Pretending that service cuts and more efficiency will save the day, Mr. Pataki has lopped off more than $2 billion from the authority's already scaled-back five-year plan to maintain the system. Even with that penury, he leaves much of the plan without financing. 
 In the 1980's, when the system was teetering on ruin, the governor, the mayor and city business leaders all pitched in to create a rescue plan. That needs to happen again, beginning with a concerted effort that's coupled with the offer of sacrifice. Mayor Michael Bloomberg can't effectively demand money to rebuild the subways at a time when he's also pushing for $300 million in state funds and committing another $300 million in city funds for an unnecessary football stadium in Manhattan. Mr. Bloomberg should get his priorities straight. And as much as we agree with the mayor about the importance of extending subway service to the Far West Side of Manhattan to spur development, it's a plan that has to take a back seat to saving the existing network.
 Business leaders should tell the governor what new taxes they would be willing to accept to save public transit. We like one idea being floated by the Partnership for New York City, which would build on London's model of imposing a surcharge on anyone driving into the city's business district. The plan could generate up to $390 million by taxing those who drive private vehicles below 60th Street during working hours. 
 Of course, the M.T.A. must help itself by cutting its administrative costs and holding down other expenses. Its idea of selling naming rights to subway stations sounds iffy, but worth exploring. None of this should detract from the obligation Mr. Pataki has to keep New York's economic engine running by protecting mass transit. The spotlight is on him, and he cannot hide from it.

HEADLINE: Anti-Bush criticism and the fixation on 'delusional' Christian fundamentalism.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Perhaps you didn't know that Christian fundamentalists were running the United States, but then perhaps you weren't attending any upscale Manhattan parties over the holiday season. Or perhaps you didn't have the advantage of being introduced as someone who writes about religion for a newspaper. 
 That party climate was crisp with shock and awe at the dubious findings about the role of moral values in the presidential election. There was a palpable sense that the Bible Belt was tightening like a noose around Gotham City and all it represented for civilization. Sometimes it was hard to tell whether the partygoers found this ominous or merely more fuel for the seasonal excitement. 
 Most of them, needless to say, had about as much personal contact with Christian fundamentalists as with Martians. In fact, ''fundamentalist'' was a handy label for a vague group of religious conservatives ''out there'' who persist in raising moral objections to abortion, same-sex marriage and embryonic-stem-cell research.
 The election had certainly revealed that these religious conservatives were a force to be reckoned with. But were they the moving forces behind the signature policies of George Bush's presidency: tax cuts, the war in Iraq, environmental deregulation and now a Social Security overhaul? Were they the sources of his administration's highly debated methods of fighting terror, handling prisoners of war, employing intelligence or explaining policies to the public?
 Are Dick Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Paul D. Wolfowitz, Alberto R. Gonzales and other decision makers taking their cues from biblical passages or Pat Robertson? Or are they carrying out ideas long fermenting within some national security circles, at conservative policy centers or among K Street lobbyists? 
 But don't suppose that the fixation on Christian fundamentalists is limited to giddy holiday revelers in Manhattan. Here is Bill Moyers, liberal sage par excellence, accepting an award last month from the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School: 
 ''One of the biggest changes in politics in my lifetime is that the delusional is no longer marginal. It has come in from the fringe, to sit in the seat of power in the Oval Office and in Congress. For the first time in our history, ideology and theology hold a monopoly of power in Washington.''
 And what is this amalgam of ideology and theology that is now possessing a monopoly of Washington power? It is nothing less than the ''bizarre'' and ''fantastical'' vision of the end times as drawn out of the Book of Revelation and portrayed in the best-selling ''Left Behind'' series of novels by the Rev. Timothy LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. 
 These beliefs are no longer a fringe phenomenon, Mr. Moyers explained, because nearly half the Congress and many of its leaders were ''backed'' by the religious right in the recent election -- that is, they earned over 80 percent approval ratings from conservative Christian lobbies. 
 What does this mean for public policy? Well, if you go online and ''read a remarkable work of reporting by the journalist Glenn Scherer,'' Mr. Moyers advised, ''you will see how millions of Christian fundamentalists may believe that environmental destruction is not only to be disregarded but actually welcomed -- even hastened -- as a sign of the coming apocalypse.''
 ''I've reported on these people, following some of them from Texas to the West Bank,'' Mr. Moyers said.
 No doubt he has, but his acceptance speech drew more from two online articles that he cited and recommended to his audience than from the up-close and personal interviewing for which he is known. There seemed to be something more ideological -- and maybe even apocalyptical -- going on in his argument. In this he was probably representative of a much wider swath of liberal opinion. 
 His ominous description of the ''delusional'' that now holds sway in the Oval Office and Congress also stands in contrast with the personal account by Mark I. Pinsky in the current issue of The Columbia Journalism Review. Mr. Pinsky compares his ''top down'' reporting on evangelical Christians for The Los Angeles Times with his immersion in Florida's evangelical culture when he later went to work for The Orlando Sentinel. 
 ''At P.T.A. meetings, at Scouts, in the supermarket checkout line and in my neighborhood,'' he writes, ''I encountered evangelicals simply as people, rather than as subjects or sources of quotes for my stories.''
 Evangelicals ''were no longer caricatures or abstractions,'' he says. ''I learned to interpret their metaphors and read their body language'' -- and discovered that ''they don't march in lockstep.''
 ''While there is near unanimity opposing gay marriage and abortion among evangelicals,'' he says, ''serious and fundamental divisions exist over other issues, including the Iraq war, environmentalism, tax policy -- and, yes, even civil unions.''
 One can grant that religious conservatives (whose ranks of course include some Roman Catholics, Jews, Muslims and Mormons as well as evangelical or fundamentalist Protestants) have significant new political power, a controversial agenda focusing on abortion, same-sex marriage and stem-cell research and a surprising acquiescence in some economic and national security policies that seem at least problematic morally. 
 One can also recognize that despite Mr. Pinsky's unruffled view of his Florida neighbors, those ranks harbor plenty of notions and personages (just as in other sectors of public life) that many people find bizarre and worrisome. 
 But does it really serve critics of the administration to convince themselves that they are dealing with some alien species that holds Washington in the grip of a ''fantastical'' religious vision, rather than with adversaries who, in their mix of political and economic ideology, self-interest, good intentions and stubborn blindness, are probably not all that constitutionally different from the television executives, foundation officers and artistic figures Mr. Moyers has been deftly coping with for decades? 
 One effect of casting his indictment of administration environmental policies in dramatic theological terms is that Mr. Moyers offered only the faintest, glancing mention of the chemical and energy industries. Is their clout, for good or ill, really nothing compared with the Book of Revelation?

HEADLINE: Ogilvie Is Riding High at the Hope After Going Low Again

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LA QUINTA, Calif., Jan. 28 

 BODY:
Joe Ogilvie keeps selling himself short. After shooting a six-under-par 66 Friday to go to 23 under in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, he played down his round.
 ''I got lucky, basically,'' said Ogilvie, who holds a two-shot lead over Peter Lonard. ''The way I played, 66 was a gift.'' 
 Ogilvie, a former economics major at Duke who plays the stock market and lists among his heroes Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, was asked how he would rate his stock through three rounds of the five-day Hope Classic.
 ''Probably overrated,'' he said, laughing. ''I'd probably be a buyer if I was at even par, but not at 23 under.
 ''There's not a whole lot to go off if you're 23 under. I'd try to buy low and sell high.''
 Ogilvie shot a 63 on Thursday and said then that, while he was leading ''score wise'' with a three-shot edge over Phil Mickelson, he considered Mickelson ''technically'' in the lead. That was because Mickelson had already played the more difficult of the four courses used for the tournament.
 Mickelson, the defending champion who was also the winner at the Hope in 2002, was not in the lead technically or otherwise after 54 holes, with a 70 dropping him seven shots behind Ogilvie.
 Fredrik Jacobson remained close after shooting a 67 that left him third at 19 under.
 Craig Stadler, who won the Hope in 1980 for his first Tour victory, shot his way into contention with a 65 that put him in a group with Mickelson at 16 under. 
 Stadler said he would have probably skipped the Hope if his son, Kevin, was not also in the field. Kevin Stadler was five under through 54 holes.
 ''I think he's kind of hot that I keep scoring better than he does every day,'' Craig Stadler said. ''I'd much rather give all my birdies to him, though. Hopefully, he'll put six or seven together tomorrow and be good enough to make the cut.''
 Ogilvie made much of his own luck during the third round, rolling in birdie putts of 20, 15, 25, 18 and 22 feet on his first nine holes.
 He began his round on the back nine at Tamarisk Country Club and was at five-under 31 at the turn. He made two birdies and a bogey over his last nine holes.
 ''I easily could have shot 37 instead of 31,'' he said of the first nine, when his drives tended to stray. ''I could easily have bogeyed three out of my first five holes. On the back side of Tamarisk, they've got white soldiers -- out-of-bounds stakes -- on both sides of the fairways.
 ''Every time I looked up, I saw out-of-bounds stakes, so it wasn't the greatest mental picture I've ever had. But I got away with it.''
 His only ''main hiccup'' during the round, he said, came on the par-5 No. 4, his 13th hole of the day.
 ''I had a bad lie and chipped it over and kind of three-putted from there,'' Ogilvie said.

CHIP SHOTS
 Davis Love III had 11 birdies and no bogeys on his way to a 61 that vaulted him from a 66th-place tie into a tie for seventh at 11 under. David Duval, who shot a Tour record-tying 59 on the final day to win the 1999 Hope, struggled to a third-round 85 that included four 7's and a pair of 6's. After an opening 82 and a 79 the second day, Duval was 30 over, the worst score by 19 strokes through 36 holes this year. Mike Weir, the 2003 champion, was tied for 108th at 214 after a third-round 71.

HEADLINE: Bush Travels Next Week To Push Benefits Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; David E. Rosenbaum contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
The White House said on Friday that President Bush would begin traveling next week to build support for his plan to overhaul Social Security, and his itinerary suggested that he was especially intent on pressuring a handful of Democratic senators to back his approach.
 Mr. Bush plans to start fleshing out his Social Security proposal in his State of the Union address on Wednesday, and the next day he will embark on a two-day campaign-style swing to North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Arkansas and Florida. At each stop, he will attend events to discuss Social Security with a cross section of voters and promote his plan to create private investment accounts within the retirement system and put it on sound financial footing, administration officials said. 
 Mr. Bush will use the sessions to build a sense of urgency to move quickly on the issue, officials said, reflecting the White House assessment that the best and, perhaps, only hope for success is to complete legislation this year. 
 In coming weeks, Mr. Bush will take his message to other regions of the country, hoping to win over voters and create pressure on his own party and Democrats in Congress to deal with Social Security despite the considerable political risks that doing so would entail. 
 ''This is the beginning of the post-State of the Union outreach that he will be doing,'' Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said. ''But he's going to continue to lead on this issue and talk directly to the American people about the importance of acting this year to strengthen Social Security.''
 Mr. Bush's sales efforts will be backed up by the Republican National Committee and an array of business and interest groups that support his approach. But some Republicans in Congress have qualms about pushing ahead, saying that dealing with the issue will require them to take unpopular steps like cutting the government-paid retirement benefit. Democrats have been almost unanimous in their opposition.
 The trip next week will be in part an effort to crack the Democratic wall. In his re-election campaign last year, Mr. Bush carried each of the five states he will visit. 
 Each of those states has at least one Democratic senator, and some of those Democrats have in the past worked across party lines. Montana, for example, is home to Senator Max Baucus, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, who provided Mr. Bush with vital support on his first round of tax cuts, in 2001. In Nebraska, the president will be on the turf of Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat who has frequently voted with the White House.
 It is not clear how many Democrats, if any, are likely to back changes to a program that has been among their party's proudest achievements and most effective political cudgels. 
 At a public meeting on Friday morning on Capitol Hill, Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, a Democrat in White House sights, called diverting tax money into personal retirement accounts ''a horrible, horrible public policy'' that would ''undermine retirement security.''
 His Democratic colleague from North Dakota, Senator Kent Conrad, who will be up for re-election next year, struck a more conciliatory tone, saying that he looked forward to working with Mr. Bush and that he supported providing more incentives for savings and investment. But Mr. Conrad said that he objected to the large-scale government borrowing that would almost certainly be required to establish private accounts and that Social Security should be addressed as part of a comprehensive package that includes overhauling the tax code and Medicare.
 Administration officials have said Mr. Bush will not set out a detailed Social Security proposal in his State of the Union address. They said he would be more specific than he has been about what he believes it will take to deal with the system's long-term financial problems and create voluntary investment accounts. 
 In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. Bush said that he would spend ''a great deal of time'' on Social Security in his State of the Union speech, and he acknowledged that his call for personal investment accounts would not by itself eliminate the long-term financial shortfall. 
 His advisers have signaled that he will support personal accounts with a limited number of investment choices like stock and bond mutual funds.
 To address the long-term problems, the White House has also floated a proposal to cut government-paid benefits from scheduled levels by changing the formula to set initial benefits from one based on economywide increases in wages to one based on price increases.

HEADLINE: United States and Europe Differ Over Strategy on Iran

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush's second term has barely begun, and Iran is already shaping up as its most serious diplomatic challenge. But conflicting pronouncements by Mr. Bush and his national security team have left Iran frustrated and angry about the direction of American policy, and the Europeans more determined than ever to push Washington to embrace their engagement strategy.
 To the outside world, the administration seems divided over whether to promote the overthrow of Iran's Islamic Republic -- perhaps by force -- or to tacitly support the approach embraced by the Europeans, which favors negotiations and a series of incentives that would ultimately require American participation. 
 ''You need to get everybody to read from the same page, the Europeans and the Americans,'' said Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in an interview in Davos on Friday. 
 ''This is not a process that is going to be solved by the Europeans alone,'' he added. ''The United States needs to be engaged. If you continue to say they are going to fail before you give them a chance, it will be a self-fulfilling policy.''
 France's foreign minister, Michel Barnier, echoed those remarks in an interview in Paris on Friday. ''I cannot explain American policy to you,'' he said. ''That would be French arrogance and I am not someone who is arrogant. But I think that the Americans must get used to the fact that Europe is going to act. And in this case, without the United States we run the risk of failure.''
 France, Germany and Britain -- with European Union support -- opened negotiations with Iran last month that could give Iran generous rewards on nuclear energy, trade and economic, political and security cooperation if Iran can provide guarantees that it is not developing a nuclear weapon.
 The negotiations flow from Iran's voluntary decision in November to temporarily freeze its programs to make enriched uranium, which can be used for producing energy or for making bombs.
 Instead of embracing the initiative, Mr. Bush began his second term with a sweeping pledge to defend the United States and protect its friends ''by force of arms if necessary'' and a refusal to rule out military action against Iran. 
 In her Senate confirmation hearings as secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice did not say no when asked whether the goal of the United States was to replace the Islamic Republic in Iran.
 Vice President Dick Cheney, too, has put Iran at the ''top of the list'' of the world's trouble spots and suggested that Israel might attack Iran militarily because of its nuclear program. Those words, combined with a report in The New Yorker that secret Pentagon operations were under way in Iran to prepare target lists for possible military action, have left the impression -- particularly in Tehran -- that Iran may be the next Iraq.
 ''Madness,'' is how Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, described that approach, while his foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, dismissed the talk of a military strike as ''psychological warfare.''
 Britain joined the American-led war in Iraq while France and Germany opposed it. But when it comes to Iran, the three European countries are unanimous in support of negotiations over any possible military plans by the United States or Israel.
 ''This is a hotbed region; the last thing we need is a military conflict in that region,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany said in Davos on Friday. ''I'm very explicit and outspoken about this because I want everybody to know where Germany stands.''
 The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, has also strongly criticized a possible military attack on Iran as ''inconceivable.'' Mr. Straw told the BBC that the issue of a military option was not raised during his talks with Ms. Rice and other officials in Washington this week. 
 But European officials say the signals emanating from Washington have been inconsistent. At one point in her confirmation hearings, Ms. Rice suggested that the United States implicitly supported the European negotiating approach, saying the Bush administration is ''trying to see'' if it will produce concrete results, though she and other officials in Washington have bluntly told the Europeans they are skeptical. 
 Ms. Rice also repeated a threat to ask the Security Council for censure or possible sanctions against Iran, and specified that even a complete halt to Iran's nuclear and missile programs would not translate into American support for a policy of engagement and incentives.
 There were ''other problems'' that precluded such an approach: ''terrorism, our past, their human rights record,'' she said.
 Further complicating the picture is that in a news conference in late December, Mr. Bush uncharacteristically admitted the limits of American power. ''We're relying upon others, because we've sanctioned ourselves out of influence with Iran,'' he said, in reference to the fact that the United States has long banned most trade and investment with Iran and has no diplomatic relations with it.
 The Europeans have made the determination that any negotiation that slows and perhaps eventually halts Iran's nuclear program is better than the alternatives proposed by the United States.
 ''Is this approach free of risks? No,'' said Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, in a telephone interview. ''Does it have a guarantee of success? No. But at this point in time it is the only game in town, no doubt about that. The other options are worse.''
 Some senior Iranian officials make the same point. ''The West has suspicions about our nuclear program; we have suspicions of the Europeans,'' said M. Javad Zarif, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations and a key negotiator with the Europeans, in a telephone interview. ''We are eager to use any possible avenue to resolve those suspicions,'' Dr. Zarif said. ''That's why we have had the pragmatism to understand that the European game is a very serious game. Washington has yet to understand that the European game is the only game in town.''
 Thus far, the three sets of ''working level'' talks on nuclear, economic and technological cooperation and political and security cooperation have yielded no concrete results, European officials said.
 On the contrary, in their meeting on Jan. 17, Iran insisted that it would never abandon its goal of ''maintaining'' its enrichment program, while the Europeans called such an approach ''unacceptable,'' insisting on the ultimate permanent cessation of the program, one of the European participants in the meeting said.
 Similarly, the most recent inspection team of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring organization, to Iran this month came away with less than it hoped for.
 Iran allowed the team to visit part of a huge military facility, called Parchin. The Bush administration has long suspected that testing of high explosives in one area of the site could be part of a program to develop a nuclear warhead. Iran insists that all of its nuclear work is for civilian purposes.
 Iran was under no international treaty obligation to allow the inspection and it stopped inspectors from visiting a bunker for high-explosive testing of conventional weapons.
 In the interview today, Dr. ElBaradei confirmed that the International Atomic Energy Agency had asked for a return visit. ''We're looking at testing grounds, yes,'' he said, adding, ''We try to go everywhere we think there might have been possible use of nuclear material that has not been declared to us.''
 Meanwhile, the Europeans cannot deliver on some of the more ambitious rewards they are discussing with Iran under their accord because they depend on American approval.
 In conversations with Ms. Rice and other administration officials since Mr. Bush's re-election, for example, the Europeans have tried but failed to persuade them to accept Iran's application to open membership talks with the World Trade Organization.
 All of Iran's European negotiating partners have argued that one of the best ways to promote democracy would be to force more transparency into Iran's economy. That could help break the stranglehold of the vast system of government-protected ''foundations,'' most of them the private fiefs of powerful clerics, European officials said.
 ''You cannot just ask Iran to renounce its nuclear program,'' said Mr. Barnier. ''You have to allow it to be a positive actor, to enter in this constructive logic of stability. It's a 'win-win' deal that we have proposed.''
