HEADLINE: The Face of Private-School Growth, Familiar-Looking but Profit-Making

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The British International School of New York offers spacious waterfront classrooms, small computers encased in rubber for small people who tend to drop them, and a pool for the once-a-week swimming classes required for all students.
But there is nothing within its halls or on its Web site that indicates what differentiates British International from the teeming masses of expensive private schools in New York: It is run for profit.
It is one of a small number of large for-profit schools that have opened recently or plan to open in New York City next year. While they are a speck on the city's private-school landscape, for-profit schools are practically the only significant primary and secondary institutions to have started up in the last decade, and may represent the future of private-school growth.
Parents and consultants have begun to take notice, and the Independent School Admission Association of Greater New York, the umbrella group for the city's elite private schools, is contemplating withdrawing its requirement that members be nonprofit, two association members said. 
James Williams, executive director of the National Independent Private School Association, whose members are for-profit schools, said that although private-school enrollment nationally had fallen because of the recession, he had seen a small upswing in applications for accreditation from for-profit schools, with significant growth in schools for children with special needs.
Parents may be hard-pressed to see much difference between for-profit and nonprofit independent schools. Both cost a lot, both depend on the children of wealthy people to attend, both pay their headmasters large salaries.
But nonprofit schools enjoy generous tax advantages, including low-cost benefit packages, property-tax exemptions and grant eligibility. They also must bridge the gap between tuition revenue and the expense of running the institution with donations, no surprise to parents who face frequent solicitations for pricey galas and the ever-needy annual fund. For-profit schools pay taxes but generally refrain from soliciting parents, instead securing money from investors who hope to make money later, if the school is sold or the company that owns it goes public.
It remains unclear how profitable a for-profit school can be, especially since private corporations are not required to disclose their financial information. But the market for private-school enrollment generally seems robust: according to one study conducted for a new school, the number of school-age children in households between Battery Park City and 72nd Street with annual incomes above $500,000 soared to 15,700 in 2010, from 4,300 a decade before. According to the study, the top dozen schools in the city -- all nonprofit -- have only 11,000 seats.
With real estate acquisition and construction so expensive in New York -- estimates range from $50 million to $100 million to build a top-flight school for multiple grades -- starting a school requires either a huge donation or significant venture capital.
All the leaders of new for-profit schools believe there is money to be made -- efficiencies to be exploited, though they are loath to say as much -- in running a school in a city where parents go to extreme measures to secure their children space in elite schools that charge more than $35,000 for kindergarten. But those leaders are also conscious that the notion of profiting from the noble aspirations of educating children can seem a little unsavory, especially in light of recent scandals involving for-profit colleges and commercial companies managing public charter schools.
''I don't think for-profits or not-for-profits have a corner on educational efficacy,'' said Christopher Whittle, who in 1991 founded the Edison Project, a plan to open up to 1,000 technologically advanced for-profit schools that would operate more efficiently than public schools He is now focused on creating Avenues: the World School, a for-profit school scheduled to open on the West Side of Manhattan next year. ''They're both capable of really good things and less than great things. The main difference is their capital source.''
Susan Wolford of BMO Capital Markets, an investment bank, said that for-profit schools had profit margins of 20 to 25 percent, before taxes and interest on debt and amortization.
The key revenue drivers are tuition and enrollment. While competition is fierce for admission to the brand-name schools, it remains to be seen if newcomers will be able to lure the same crowds. ''Parents like schools with a long history and reputation of excellence,'' said Victoria Goldman, author of ''The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools and Selective Public Schools.'' ''Certainly if they pay $30,000 to $35,000, they want tried-and-true.''
But owners of for-profit schools say they will have more freedom to experiment without a backlash from parents, teachers, administrators and alumni.
''There's a can-do attitude here,'' said William T. Phelps, the new headmaster of the British International School. ''If I say, 'Can you try this out,' 95 percent of the time the answer is 'Yes.' In established schools, you try to move a painting and there's a backlash.''
Some of the city's for-profit schools have been around for decades, including the Dwight School, York Preparatory School and the Mandell School.One of the newcomers, Claremont Preparatory, is part of a company called MetSchools, which owns 10 schools and preschools in New York City. Among them are for-profit and nonprofit schools, including the Rebecca School and the Aaron School, which cater to children with developmental disabilities and rely heavily on government money.
Claremont's experience is a study in contradictions. It was founded in 2005 with 54 students. This year, 575 children will stretch out over the school's 325,000 square feet. (It has a pool and a banquet hall, which can be rented for parties.)
But the school has had three headmasters in five years and was sued last year by a former school psychologist who said she was fired for reporting to child welfare authorities that a student had said his mother had hit him.
In its response to the suit, Claremont denied the psychologist's accusations and said she had breached her contract and failed to use her training to properly evaluate the situation. Lawyers on both sides did not return several calls for comment.
In June, Claremont's founder, Michael Koffler, abruptly announced that the headmaster would be leaving, angering parents who had already put down deposits for the fall. And while enrollment has grown, it is nowhere near the school's onetime goal of 1,000 students by 2007. Mr. Koffler declined to comment; a spokeswoman said he was too busy with the start of the school year.
To attract students, the new schools often try to offer something special. Claremont, which has little competition in its Wall Street neighborhood, has its modern, spacious campus. The Avenues school intends to let students transfer seamlessly among its planned 20 schools in major cities around the world -- if, for example, their parents' high-salary jobs require them to move abroad.
The World Class Learning Academy, in the East Village, another for-profit venture, will use the patented International Primary Curriculum, which it says is used in 1,000 schools worldwide (5 in the United States). Originally scheduled to open in 2011, World Class announced this spring that it would instead start in September, only to back away from the decision soon afterward, citing construction issues and the fact that it had enrolled only a small number of children.
Initial plans for Avenues give a sense of where for-profit schools might try to find savings: class size will be roughly the same as at top Manhattan schools, but there will be fewer teachers, and they will be expected to spend a larger percentage of their day in the classroom. One person involved in the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the plans were still fluid, said the school also planned to pay the teachers more than the notoriously low salaries of private-school teachers.
And administrators of for-profit schools are eager to highlight that they do not go hat-in-hand to parents every few months. ''Those donations come with strings and baggage,'' said Gabriella Rowe, head of the Mandell School.
Andrea Greystoke, the British International School founder, who has six children of her own, said, ''After paying six lots of school fees, I have a great antipathy for fund-raising.''
Not so at Claremont. It has a separate nonprofit parents' association, which Mr. Koffler said in an interview earlier this year had raised $250,000 for financial aid last year, about 10 percent of the $2.5 million in aid that the school provided students.
But such arrangements could raise concerns about whether tax-deductible donations are being used to support a for-profit enterprise. Roger Colinvaux, a law professor at Catholic University in Washington who worked for the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, asked, ''Is the not-for-profit primarily helping the student get an education or primarily helping the for-profit get tuition?''

HEADLINE: The Hungry of the World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''U.N. Finds Tally of Hungry Has Fallen, but Stays High'' (news article, Sept. 15) is welcome news. It is worth noting, however, that this decline is from a spike in hunger after food price increases in 2007-08; it does not fully reverse that earlier increase. 
Food price increases moved over 100 million people into hunger in 2008. Favorable conditions have allowed 80 million of them to escape hunger for the moment, but as long as their poverty persists, they remain likely to fall back into undernourishment.
The volatility in the number of undernourished people points to the deeper problem of vulnerability. While the United Nations tracks the number of chronically undernourished people, a measure of hunger vulnerability incorporating the poverty that leaves people at risk of hunger (as well as hunger itself) would likely show even less improvement.
The current volatility of grain markets combined with broad economic malaise makes hunger vulnerability an urgent concern.

HEADLINE: ADVERTISING: A Twist on Reagan

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Citizens for the Republic, a conservative grass-roots lobbying group, plans to release a stark, one-minute ad on Wednesday called ''Mourning in America,'' a play on the 1984 ad for Ronald Reagan, ''Morning in America.'' 
''There's mourning in America,'' the new spot begins, as dreary images of unemployed workers and dilapidated buildings glide by. ''Today, 15 million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work, business is shuttered, 2,900 families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall.''
The ad is a blunt, almost point-by-point comparison to the hopeful, optimistic spot from Reagan's re-election year. ''Morning in America'' promoted the future, noting, ''This afternoon, 6,500 young men and women will be married and with inflation at less than half of what it was just four years ago, they can look forward with confidence to the future.'' This week's spot offers a grim contrast: ''This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married, each of their children to be born with a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt.''
People familiar with the buy say the citizens group, which Reagan started in 1977 as a political action committee, is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to put the ad on national cable channels for one week.
''It's morning again in America,'' the Reagan ad concludes, as the Capitol glistens against a night sky and people raise American flags up flagpoles. ''And under the leadership of President Reagan, our country is prouder and stronger and better.''
The new spot ends with distinctly different adjectives.
''There's mourning in America,'' a narrator intones. ''Under the leadership of President Obama, our country is fading and weaker and worse off. His policies were a grand experiment, policies that failed. This November, let's choose a smaller, more caring government, one that remembers us.''
The organization is hoping that their spot could be a breakout ad for this election cycle, and they enlisted the help of Fred Davis, a Republican media consultant who was behind the now infamous Carly Fiorina ''Demon Sheep'' ad.
''They wanted something that could be a big umbrella message for what malaise is in the country,'' Mr. Davis said. ''They came to me and basically said, 'We're not happy with the way things are going in the country, and what can we do that has the potential to be a game changer?' ''
Mr. Davis said he kept coming back to Reagan's 1984 commercial - an ad he said he liked for its elegant simplicity- and submitted a version of ''Morning in America'' to the citizens group. It then added the extra vowel, transforming it to ''Mourning.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Did Firehouse Subs Pick the Right Plan?

BYLINE: YOU'RE THE BOSS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: A restaurant chain decides to ask its struggling franchisees to spend more on marketing.

 BODY:
In a case study we've just published, Kermit Pattison writes about Firehouse Subs, a fast-food sandwich chain based in Florida. When the recession hit, the chain's sales took a dive. At first, Firehouse responded by rescinding the 2 percent marketing fee it had been collecting from its franchisees and encouraging them to spend that money on local marketing. When that failed, the chain took a very different approach: it asked its franchisees to increase the amount of money they were spending on marketing and it unleashed an $8 million advertising campaign -- right into the teeth of the recession. It also chose Zimmerman Advertising to handle its corporate account. 
Below, you can read what several business owners with relevant experience think of Firehouse's decisions, and you can leave your own comment below. We'll follow up next week with a blog post that will explain how those strategies have been working for Firehouse.
Bob Fiddler, founder of the Fiddler Group, a brand development firm: 
"The right call? Absolutely. And a brave one, too. It's not easy to go to your franchisees and ask for more money, especially when times are tough. Most franchisors take the easy road, discounting to drive a little extra traffic and keep their franchisees happy. But in the end, they give away their margin for a quick high and a hangover. The morning after the discount ends, they're back where they started, only worse.
"What the Firehouse people realized was that strong brands are more powerful than price cuts, even in a tough economy. Zimmerman deserves a lot of credit, too -- first for demonstrating that investing in brand communication can drive traffic better than discounting, and second by helping them avoid the pitfall of under-spending, which could have sabotaged the whole affair.
Kevin Reddy, chief executive of Noodles & Company, a chain of fast-food restaurants:
"I would commend Firehouse for investing in their system long-term through a brand-building campaign focused on differentiation, not short-term discounting or reducing food quality. Although I favor the long-term approach, it puts greater pressure on the near-term financial results of the campaign.
"Even though this campaign may have generated the expected results, I would strongly recommend a growing brand in new markets continue to build a culture of local store marketing, sharing ideas and implementing the tactics and measurement around such success.
"Consumers today are more discerning and skeptical of traditional advertising. Loyalty is built over time through excellent operations and building relationships."
Burton D. Cohen, managing director of a franchise consulting firm, a retired senior vice president and chief franchising officer for McDonald's, and an adjunct professor at the Kellogg School of Management:
"Allowing the franchisees to do their own local marketing is generally a good idea if there is a monitoring mechanism in place, and if the franchisor provides guidance, expertise and creative support. This did not happen here, and the franchisees were left to fend for themselves. They either didn't spend the money, or spent it ineffectively. The new advertising agency filled that gap, confirming that Firehouse waited too long to change agencies. Going forward, efforts should be made to bring the nonparticipating franchisees into the program. The best way to convince reluctant franchisees to do anything is to demonstrate that the idea works. Management made the right call, but more work needs to be done for the long-term growth of the system."
Steve Forbes, a Subway franchisee in Waterbury, Vt.:
"It would appear that Firehouse was having an identity crisis. They knew who they were, but their customer base did not. While very risky and potentially unpopular with their franchisees, I think Firehouse had no other option but to do a large-scale campaign to show the customer their strong points. Local advertising is an important part of any strategy, but a cohesive message was needed. Asking the franchisees to double their contributions was probably too large a hit for struggling stores, but it did give them cash for a major campaign. If this worked, it would appear to be a no-brainer with praise for all involved, but if it failed, the leadership would be in a position where the franchisee community would not have any trust in their guidance and would feel that they had been taken advantage of at their weakest time."

HEADLINE: Spending More on Ads To Overcome a Slump

BYLINE: By KERMIT PATTISON

 BODY:
Firehouse Subs is a 16-year-old restaurant chain based in Jacksonville, Fla. It emphasizes a firefighter theme and has more than 390 restaurants that serve specialty submarine sandwiches.
THE CHALLENGE Facing declining sales throughout its system, the chain sought a new marketing strategy in the depths of the recession.
THE BACKGROUND Robin and Chris Sorensen, brothers and former firefighters, opened their first Firehouse Subs restaurant in 1994. They emphasized their firefighter heritage by featuring red furnishings, colorful murals of firefighters in action and sandwiches like the hook-and-ladder sub.
By 2001, the chain had grown to 30 company-owned restaurants in Florida and switched to a franchise model to expand into new markets. By early 2008, the company had expanded to 300 locations in 17 states, mostly in the South and Southeast. But then growth fizzled. 
That March, comparative sales for the entire system declined from the previous March. ''In our entire history, we had never had a period like that when our entire system was running negative sales,'' said Don Fox, the chief executive. ''It was something completely foreign to us.''
At the time, in addition to a 6 percent royalty, Firehouse Subs was collecting a 3 percent advertising fee from franchisees, including 2 percent for local advertising. As sales fell, the company's executives grew dissatisfied with their advertising agency and started groping for a new strategy. But with no answers on hand, Robin Sorensen, the chairman, floated an unconventional suggestion: Why not give the local marketing dollars back to the stores?
''Some people thought it was insane to give the money back,'' Mr. Sorensen said. ''We didn't have an ego about who has this money. We want results. We could feel the onus on our shoulders. We're the leadership team, and we've got to do something.''
In a meeting with franchisees that June, the corporate leadership unveiled the new strategy: franchisees could keep the 2 percent of royalties that normally went to the local marketing fund. In return, franchisees were expected to do their own marketing.
The company used the honor system, with no mechanism to verify that the local stores actually did any advertising. ''It was something pretty radical,'' Mr. Fox said. ''I'm not aware of any franchiser ever taking that step, and I've been in the business 35 years.''
But things only got worse. When the company stopped collecting marketing royalties in July 2008, comparative sales were off 3.4 percent from the previous July. By the end of 2008, systemwide sales were running 6 percent behind the previous year -- far below the industry average, which was off 2 percent. ''We didn't feel our brand deserved this kind of disproportionate loss,'' Mr. Fox said.
In downturns, consumers often trade down to less expensive restaurants, and Firehouse Subs should have been positioned to capture some of these customers. For some reason, the chain was being bypassed. Its executives became convinced the problem stemmed from a lack of brand awareness.
THE OPTIONS One option was to continue the local marketing efforts. But Firehouse had tried that for six months. Mr. Fox and Mr. Sorensen estimate that only about a third of their franchisees made meaningful efforts to market themselves.
Another option was discounting, a common tactic to increase sales. But the leadership team quickly dismissed that. The chain's gross margins were already modest compared with those of its competitors -- the consequence, the leaders contended, of large portions, more expensive ingredients and low prices. Mr. Fox and Mr. Sorensen also rejected the idea of reducing portion sizes or using cheaper ingredients.
So they turned to a new marketing campaign. ''I knew our brand was stronger and deserved better than negative 6 percent,'' Mr. Fox said.
As the experiment with local advertising had failed, Firehouse Subs began looking for a new agency to handle the corporate account. It chose Zimmerman Advertising, which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and whose accounts include Papa John's Pizza and Nissan. In its presentation, the agency promised an 8 percent increase in sales, a bold move in the grim economic climate of early 2009.
But it would not come cheaply. To do a proper campaign, Zimmerman insisted that the company not only reclaim the 2 percent local marketing fee but double it, -- asking franchisees to pay 4 percent. That would increase the combined royalty and advertising fees to 11 percent from the original 9 percent when most franchisees were struggling.
At first, Mr. Sorensen balked. But when the ad agency laid out data showing that some competing chains were spending more on advertising per store, he began to change his mind. Subway franchisees, for example, pay an 8 percent royalty and a 4.5 percent advertising fee; Quiznos franchisees pay a 7 percent royalty and a 4 percent advertising fee, according to those companies. Firehouse hired Zimmerman to do a test campaign in three cities.
Zimmerman developed a creative campaign and radio ads that emphasized the food and the portion sizes, but offered no discounts. The agency used the Sorensen brothers as spokesmen. The slogan: ''Our way beats their way. If you don't agree, it's free.''
In June 2009, the corporate executives made the case for ''investment spending'' at the annual meeting with franchisees. Firehouse and Zimmerman showed results from the three test markets. Augusta, Ga., Jacksonville, and Knoxville, Tenn., had all had double-digit sales increases after the test campaign.
Franchisees were allowed to vote on whether to take part in the new marketing program in their markets. About two-thirds of franchisees agreed to pay the 4 percent marketing fee. The ad program ran only in markets where all franchisees agreed. Those who did not agree paid the 2 percent fee.
With a new marketing war chest, Firehouse Subs and Zimmerman started an $8 million advertising campaign in September 2009.
WHAT OTHER OWNERS SAY Other business owners with similar experiences were asked to comment.
Kevin Reddy, chief executive of Noodles & Company, a chain of fast food restaurants based in Broomfield, Colo.: ''I would commend Firehouse for investing in their system long-term through a brand-building campaign focused on differentiation, not short-term discounting or reducing food quality. Although I favor the long-term approach, it puts greater pressure on the near-term financial results of the campaign.''
Bob Fiddler, founder of the Fiddler Group, a brand development firm in Annapolis, Md.: ''The right call? Absolutely. And a brave one, too. It's not easy to go to your franchisees and ask for more money, especially when times are tough. Most franchisers take the easy road, discounting to drive a little extra traffic and keep their franchisees happy.''
Burton D. Cohen, managing director of a franchise consulting firm, a retired senior vice president and chief franchising officer for McDonald's, and an adjunct professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University: ''Allowing the franchisees to do their own local marketing is generally a good idea if there is a monitoring mechanism in place, and if the franchiser provides guidance, expertise and creative support. This did not happen here, and the franchisees were left to fend for themselves. They either didn't spend the money, or spent it ineffectively. The new advertising agency filled that gap, confirming that Firehouse waited too long to change agencies.''

HEADLINE: Angry Voters Shout 'Recall' At City Halls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The throw-the-rascals-out mood is so strong these days that some voters are not even waiting until Election Day -- they are mounting recall campaigns to oust mayors in the middle of their terms, often as punishment for taking unpopular steps like raising taxes or laying off workers to keep their cities solvent.
Daniel Varela Sr., the rookie mayor of Livingston, Calif., learned this the hard way when he was booted from office last month in a landslide recall election. His crime? He had the temerity to push through the small city's first water-rate increase in more than a decade to try to fix its aging water system, which he said spewed brownish, smelly water from rusty pipes.
''We were trying to be responsible,'' said Mr. Varela, whose action set off a lawsuit in addition to his recall as mayor of Livingston, which is in the Central Valley. ''But as soon as the rates started to kick in, people who weren't paying attention were suddenly irate.'' 
With irate voters in plentiful supply, recall campaigns have become a growing job hazard for mayors. Over the last two years, failed recall campaigns have sought the ouster of mayors in Akron, Ohio; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Flint, Mich.; Kansas City, Mo.; Portland, Ore.; and Toledo, Ohio, among other cities. Next month the voters of North Pole, Alaska, 140 miles south of the Arctic Circle, will vote on whether to recall their mayor.
Recalls rarely get on the ballot, let alone succeed, but they are bringing the era of permanent, acrimonious campaigning to city halls. Tom Cochran, the executive director of the United States Conference of Mayors, said the rash of recent attempts had inspired him to start making a video to teach mayors about the risk of recall.
''I'm absolutely convinced that we've got more going on than before,'' said Mr. Cochran, who attributed the increase to the dismal economy, and to the proliferation of blogs and social networking sites that make it easier for opponents to organize.
It is not an easy time to be a mayor. At city halls, deficits are not viewed as some far-off problem, as they often are at the federal level, but as gaping holes that must be filled at once by raising taxes or cutting services.
And because city services have a clear impact on people's day-to-day lives -- think police protection or garbage pickup -- those cuts generate huge outcries. Tellingly, many recent recall campaigns have been spurred not by accusations of corruption, but by anger over higher taxes or reduced services.
Tea Party leaders in several states have tried to recall mayors and lawmakers, and they came close to forcing a recall vote this year on Mayor Ron Littlefield of Chattanooga. The local Tea Party bonded with several other groups to seek the recall of Mr. Littlefield, largely because they objected to his decision to raise storm-water fees to comply with federal environmental regulations, and to raise property taxes.
''Those are unpopular things, not things that anyone likes to do, but sometimes in a community you have to step up and do what has to be done,'' Mr. Littlefield said. ''I hope that the recall environment does not become so pervasive that it discourages people from doing the right thing.''
The mayor's opponents collected more than 15,000 signatures in their effort to recall him, but a judge ruled this month that many were invalid and that the groups had failed to collect enough valid signatures to force a recall vote.
Mr. Littlefield said the episode had been a major distraction just as the city was eagerly waiting for its new Volkswagen plant to go into production.
Supporters of recalls say they provide a much-needed check on power and give citizens the ability to oust officials accused of corruption. In Bell, Calif., a small working-class city near Los Angeles that became notorious for paying its city manager nearly $800,000 a year, a citizens group was already seeking the recall of several city officials before eight current or former officials were arrested on charges of corruption this week.
But opponents of recalls complain that they often allow a small minority of people to upend the political process.
That appears to have happened last year in Akron, where the longtime mayor, Donald L. Plusquellic, who has been widely credited with reviving the city's downtown since taking office in 1987, found himself facing a heated recall campaign. The campaign began after he made unpopular proposals to raise taxes and to create a college scholarship fund for all Akron students by selling or leasing the city's sewer system, both of which failed.
Getting a recall question on the ballot required signatures of 20 percent of those who voted in the last election. But because Mr. Plusquellic had run unopposed in his last general election, few people had voted, so fewer than 3,200 signatures were required to force a recall election in a city of more than 200,000 people.
''It was something like 3 percent of the city's adult population,'' Mr. Plusquellic said. ''They claim it's democracy. I claim it's an abuse of democracy. You can find 3 percent against the Constitution of the United States, 3 percent against democracy, against the Bible.''
Mr. Plusquellic prevailed in the recall election by a ratio of three to one. Afterward, Akron revised its charter to require the signatures of 20 percent of the city's registered voters to put a recall question on the ballot.
It is difficult to say for certain how many recalls there are; many are made at local levels of government, like school boards or the councils of small towns. At least 29 states allow for the recall of some local officials.
Recall campaigns have sought the removal of Democrats, like Mr. Plusquellic, in Akron; Republicans, like Mayor Vincent R. Barrella of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J.; and mayors who were elected in nonpartisan campaigns, like Mr. Littlefield in Chattanooga.
But several mayors say they believe that recall efforts have become more common as the economic downturn has soured the electorate.
Flint, of course, was hurting before the national downturn hit -- and it was a hotbed of recalls before the trend spread. One Flint mayor was recalled in 2002; another resigned in 2009, just before another recall election was scheduled.
This year the new mayor, Dayne Walling -- an energetic former Rhodes scholar -- found himself fighting yet another recall campaign after he laid off police officers and firefighters to try to make ends meet in a city with an unemployment rate of more than 25 percent.
''Having to make public-safety layoffs is something that I'd hoped to never have to do,'' said Mr. Walling, 36, who noted that he had resorted to layoffs only after the police and fire unions failed to agree to the concessions he had sought, and after he cut his own salary, auctioned off the mayor's car and started paying his own cellphone bills.
When the latest recall was derailed in court this month, the mayor posted the news on his blog: ''Flint's recall fever has broken.''

HEADLINE: Bulletproof Clothing: Take Your Best Shot

BYLINE: By CINTRA WILSON

 BODY:
THE opening of a palatial new boutique on the priciest stretch of Madison Avenue during a downturn, when so many storefronts have papered their windows, raises questions. Who are these people? Are they from an alternate dimension where there is a parallel, but separate, economy? Can they fly?
Since becoming president and executive creative director of Coach, Reed Krakoff has raised the accessories brand from a $500 million company in the late '90s to a ubiquitous $3 billion monolith. But apparently, he really wants to sing. I mean direct. I mean, he wants to be a legendary fashion designer. So, after introducing his clothing line last season, he made the rather nervy move of opening a hugely expensive shop in New York (and another in Tokyo), a mere shoe-toss away from those of historic design houses he would appear to regard as his contemporaries: Prada, Chloe, Lanvin, et al.
Fashion reviewers have struggled to be kind about Mr. Krakoff's sartorial talent, which isn't quite ripe yet. Blog commenters, grumbling and eye-rolling, have declared that it is not possible to do it this way: that you can't buy yourself into the role of an important, relevant fashion designer. 
Well -- ding-dong -- apparently you can. It's interesting to witness the stupendously splashy introduction of a designer who might not make it through the first five eliminations on a season of ''Project Runway.'' It feels ... awkward. As if Cybill Shepherd had performed her first jazz-singing gig at Carnegie Hall awkward.
But here we go, through the heavy black glass doors, into a high white room, where a heady aroma of new leather and cut wood hits the nose of the Shopper like a $1,500 handbag full of after-shave.
Mr. Krakoff has casually described his ambitious new look as ''luxe punk.'' Indeed, one could not accuse the line of being too feminine. Everything looks sturdy, thick, armored and unbreakable, even the sweaters.
''It's a very interesting time to re-embrace American design,'' Mr. Krakoff says on his Web site. ''That ability to take something industrial and utilitarian and elevate it.''
My interest was piqued by a thick little black dress that I assumed was wrought from Kevlar seat-belt material; only between my fingers did it reveal itself to be a particularly butch gauge of linen. I was not convinced the designer was aware that the safety-regulation appearance of the dress made the mannequin (which was jointed, like a pose-able drawing model) resemble a crash-test dummy -- an impression reinforced by orthopedic-looking accessories nearby, like an ivory fur-wool whiplash collar.
Despite my tendency to disregard artistic prestige obtained via the vulgar mechanisms of brute wealth, I did like stuff. Much of the heavy metal jewelry would be ideal for hand-to-hand combat: shiny gunmetal chain-links of a girth normally seen around the waists of bicycle messengers; bracelets resembling the hardware required to break a psychotic horse.
The footwear, too, is nicely aggressive -- for example, armored motorcycle boots with enough buckles for fight-dancing to Michael Jackson's ''Bad'' album.
Perhaps the most puzzling accessory was the ''Beaver suspenders'' ($3,200), a strappy black lederhosen-like contraption with wide beaver-pelt mudflaps on each hip. I couldn't make sense of it, but it would certainly keep your kidneys warm if you were out poaching mastodons. The video of Mr. Krakoff's runway show, projected on a wall, was little help. When the model Karlie Kloss, who is nine feet tall and has thighs the circumference of a tangelo, wears this totalitarian beaver-enforcement garment, she looks like the box her dishwasher came in. There is little doubt that if I wore it, people would call me Mr. Baggins and beg me to destroy the Ring.
''It's definitely a conversation starter,'' the saleswoman offered, aware of the garment's difficulties. ''Or a conversation ender.''
Struggling to envision a context in which these dense garments could exist, I eventually came up with a movie plot. The time: a not-too-distant future, post-environmental collapse, as seen through the limited technologies and styles of 1979. Kurt Russell stars as a tough Yukon cop in an arctic dystopia. He stumbles upon a glacier and finds, encased within, a living-room set, with four perfectly preserved wealthy women in long, thick beige sweaters with built-in elbow pads ($940); tall, lizard-skin spectator boots ($1,895); and massive amber-tint sunglasses, flash-frozen around a massive chrome coffee table. He thaws them out and takes them as wives, only to refreeze them when their hunting skills prove to be inept and their resurrected conversation bores his favorite sled dog to death.
I TRIED one of the utility-inspired numbers: a buckled kimono jumper made of the kind of gabardine that auto mechanics wore in the 1950s ($1,190). I liked its perverse combination of expensiveness and pseudo-blue-collarness, for both good and wrong reasons. It didn't quite fit; neither did the black seat-belt dress, but I did admire it: racer-tank back, heavy as a vintage overcoat, astonishingly nice buttonholes hidden inside ($1,390).
A long black leather gown in a similar cut also showed spunk and promise ($3,700), but I couldn't envision a woman who could fit in it properly; the model walking on the wall in the same dress seemed to be fighting it for normal movement.
Rich people are not like us. The most compelling luxury at Reed Krakoff is the rare spectacle of enough capital to squander on a learning curve that most people would prefer to master privately, before inflicting their genius on an unsuspecting public.
But hey, this is America. Chief executives and movie stars buy their way into politics. Reed Krakoff stuck a lovely boutique on Madison Avenue and behold: he is a major designer. If he can get it to fly, we will salute ... eventually.
Reed Krakoff: 831 Madison Avenue (near 69th Street); (212) 904-1232. KIKOFF The accessories emperor Reed Krakoff has enshrined himself in a lavish shop to celebrate his spanking new fashion line, offering haute-punk riffs on utility shapes. KRAKUP Two Asian girls giggled at some clunkier Krakoffs (huge beaver cavewoman vest, $7,900), but many pieces will tempt the modern Barbarella who likes her sandals covered in boar hair and her coats sleeveless. KRAFKAESQUE What the designer lacks in fashion experience, he makes up for in gorgeous handbags, a good humored, helpful staff and a perfectly finished dressing room. It will be fun to watch what shapes the audacious Mr. Krakoff relaxes into after recovering from his own birth trauma.

HEADLINE: Jobs and Bonuses Worry Wall Street

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
Wall Street's bankers and traders are getting nervous again. This time, it is not fear of regulatory backlash that has them concerned, but the more traditional worries about bonuses and layoffs.
The industry has suffered a couple of tough quarters since banks started hiring after the 2008 financial crisis. Unless business picks up soon, the prospect of less revenue feeding more mouths means job cuts are to come.
The cull may have already started. Bank of America is trimming up to 5 percent of staff in parts of its investment bank. Others may not be far behind. One place to look for vulnerabilities is the line in earnings reports detailing the average compensation per employee that banks have put aside. 
Look at Goldman Sachs, which has raised its head count by 7.5 percent since last September. Consensus estimates put its third-quarter revenue at $9.5 billion -- 7 percent above its disappointing second quarter, but almost 25 percent lower than last summer. Assuming the firm withholds 43 percent of that $9.5 billion for pay, as it did in the first half of this year, it will have set aside $392,000 per employee so far this year. That doesn't sound too shabby, but it's 25 percent less than in the first nine months of 2009.
That leaves Goldman, along with other banks in similar situations, with a problem. There has been plenty of noise about deals that might happen at some point and could raise revenue, including planned initial stock offerings. And those transactions could help kick-start trading markets, which the Jefferies Group, a smaller rival, described as ''painfully slow across the board'' in its third-quarter report. But if such business fails to materialize, Goldman will have to pay its staff for cooling its heels. That will take money away from those bankers who are still making money.
JPMorgan Chase isn't in as tight a situation. Based on estimates for the third quarter, its bonus stash through September may be only 14 percent below the first nine months of last year. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, which has increased its revenue this year, could end up squirreling away 11 percent more per employee. That may give it breathing room that some of its rivals cannot afford. But if business doesn't pick up soon, it won't be far behind with the ax.
Tech-Stock Cash
Microsoft stock now yields more than Uncle Sam's bonds. Not long ago, technology investors didn't expect, or want, dividends. Now, Microsoft is raising its dividend payout yield to a tidy 2.6 percent, more than 10-year Treasuries. Cisco is paying its first dividend. With growth slowing, it's no wonder shareholders need better rewards for the industry's risks.
Companies can more easily hoard cash when big opportunities for more sales exist. Amazon.com's return on invested capital, for example, has averaged around 50 percent a year over the last several years. So, it makes sense to plow money into the business.
Yet, even fast-growing companies like Apple and Google can have too much cash. Those two tech leaders combined have about $75 billion in net cash and investments on their balance sheets and are steadily adding to their stockpiles. If this cannot be wisely reinvested in the business, there is a risk it will be squandered on overpriced acquisitions.
The reality is more complex for most software companies and gadget makers. They have plenty of cash but can't realistically promise growth. Understandably, investors are increasingly wondering why they should park their money in these stocks, risking their principal, instead of looking elsewhere.
Treasury bond buyers may suffer more from inflation, but don't have to worry about technological obsolescence. Microsoft's dominant cash cow, on the other hand, could eventually be gutted by Google or Apple. A dividend helps compensate for that risk.
So the herd has slowly moved toward the dividend pasture. Seven of the top 10 biggest tech companies now pay a quarterly stipend to shareholders. This increases pressure on the holdouts to initiate a dividend, and for those paying one to increase it.
Other things being equal, investors should prefer companies that offer better cash rewards. And there's plenty of room to raise payouts. The tech sector yield, weighted by market capitalization, is just over 1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index still offers almost twice as much over all.

HEADLINE: At Call Center, Cultural Clash In Reverse

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Back in superpower times, cultural clashes took place on this side of the ocean and the joke was on the foreigners. Andy Kaufman memorably played Latka, an oddball Eastern European on ''Taxi.''Bronson Pinchot was an emigre from a Greek-like island on ''Perfect Strangers,'' a sitcom about Balki Bartokomous, a guileless shepherd who collided with the American way of life.
''Outsourced,'' which begins on Thursday on NBC and is based on a 2006 movie with the same title, reverses the premise to place an American naif out of his depth in the developing world. Todd (Ben Rappaport) is a manager at Mid America Novelties in Kansas City, who is sent to Mumbai to run a call center staffed by Indian employees. 
Like Balki, who loved and mangled American pop culture, Todd loves and mangles Indian civilization. On his first ride in an auto rickshaw, he is scared but exhilarated by the surging, heedless traffic, exclaiming, ''It's like Frogger, but with real people.'' He is stunned to find a sacred cow wandering freely on the street and even more amazed to learn that his new employees don't understand a reference to ''The Bad News Bears.''
In other words, ''Outsourced'' could be perfectly awful.
The fact that it's neither embarrassing nor deeply offensive -- once it gets rolling, the show is actually quite charming -- is a credit to the cast and the writers. The show mocks Todd's blithe, well-meaning ignorance as much as it lampoons Indians trying to sell catalog items like fake vomit and ''jiggle jugs.''
Todd has to explain the Christmas mistletoe tradition to Asha (Rebecca Hazlewood), a refined and beautiful employee who has trouble grasping the point of a holiday mistletoe belt buckle. After he explains, she is still bewildered, asking, ''This is how you celebrate the birthday of the son of your God?''
The dialogue is punctuated with Bollywood music, and there are some sophomoric cultural jokes, but ''Outsourced'' tries not to be too demeaning. Todd keeps a framed picture of a fancy executive office as an inspiration. In an early, rough version of the pilot, his deputy, an assistant manager named Rajiv (Rizwan Manji), explains his own aspirations, saying, ''My dream is not to have to use the toilet after my father.'' The new version rightly scraps that line and has Rajiv say instead that if he gets a promotion, he will be able to move out of his parents' apartment and finally marry.
Todd has some difficult encounters with the locals, but the biggest boor in town is a fellow expatriate, a typical Ugly American named Charlie (Diedrich Bader), who runs the All American Hunter call center and spurns the locals and the native cuisine, importing peanut butter and processed American cheese.
Todd is more open to discovery. And his employees quickly reveal themselves to be an endearing assortment with a fair share of misfits, including Rajiv, who is closer to Sammy Glick than Gunga Din; Madhuri (Anisha Nagarajan), a shy young woman who doesn't speak above a whisper; and Gupta (Parvesh Cheena), the talkaholic office pest. Basically, Mid America Novelties is a recession-era version of Dunder Mifflin -- if ''The Office'' had downsized and relocated to Mumbai.
At this point, Indian phone banks are something of a worn-out punch line, but ''Outsourced'' tries to build a bigger story around the opening joke. And that's liberating. South Asians are no longer an exotic minority that needs to be sheltered from comic stereotypes; for one thing, there is no easily recognized stereotype. The Indians, Pakistanis and other characters with roots on the subcontinent vary widely -- and it's hard to think of a show that doesn't have one.
Archie Panjabi won an Emmy this year for her role as a sexy, enigmatic private investigator on ''The Good Wife.'' Adhir Kalyan plays an acerbic, Oxford-educated personal assistant on ''Rules of Engagement.'' Mindy Kaling is a boy-crazy singleton on ''The Office,'' while Aziz Ansari is a sleazy small-town bureaucrat on ''Parks and Recreation.'' Sendhil Ramamurthy, who was a geneticist on ''Heroes,'' is now playing a playboy C.I.A. operative on ''Covert Affairs.'' And so on.
The influx of South Asian talent echoes this country's changing demographics. According to the Census Bureau, the South Asian population in the United States grew more than 100 percent from 1990 to 2000. More important, the children who were born in the United States after the wave of immigration in the mid-1960s are fully assimilated and a growing force in entertainment and politics -- and sometimes both, as was the case with Kal Penn, who left his role on ''House'' to work in the Obama White House. (He has since returned to acting.)
Audiences in the age of the Internet and ''Slumdog Millionaire'' have evolved as well. ''Outsourced'' is a comedy about Indian capitalism that mostly makes fun of American decline. That's a healthy sign -- television may be the one American industry that is not on a downward slope.
Outsourced

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A television review on Thursday about ''Outsourced,'' a new NBC show about an American sent to run a call center in India, misidentified the job held by the Eastern European character played by Andy Kaufman on ''Taxi'' in citing earlier shows that portrayed cultural clashes. The character, Latka, was a mechanic, not a cabdriver.

HEADLINE: NOW ARRIVING; Amid Joblessness, Mexican Workers Are a Steady Force

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Night and day, the heavy front door rarely stops swinging. Men and women pass one another at the entrance of a four-story building on 21st Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, on their way out to work, or back in for a few hours of sleep between shifts. They are line cooks, construction laborers, deliverymen, deli workers, housecleaners and gardeners.
A dozen of the building's 16 apartments are occupied by Mexicans, and most of those have two families per unit, sometimes more. Except for a few women caring for small children, all the adults -- about 50 -- are employed. Most work long hours, six days a week, for minimum wage or less. Some have two jobs.
The building is a microcosm of Mexican industriousness in New York City. And there are hundreds of others like it, bastions of low-wage work, crowding and hope. 
In a time of widespread joblessness, Mexicans in New York have proved unusually adept at finding and keeping work. Of the city's 10 largest immigrant groups, they have the highest rate of employment and are more likely to hold a job than New York's native-born population, according to an analysis of the most recently available census data. They are even employed at a greater rate than Mexicans nationwide.
And as they have filled the city's restaurant kitchens and building sites, they have acquired a reputation for an extraordinary work ethic.
''They put their heads down and work,'' said John Delgado, business manager of Local 79, a general building laborers' union in New York. ''They're very, very humble. They're dedicated, whether they work half a day or a day and a half.''
That success, though, has a flip side. One reason Mexicans have found work in such numbers, experts say, is that many are illegal immigrants, and less likely to report workplace abuses to the authorities for fear of deportation.
''Illegal immigrants are very convenient,'' said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. ''Employers are quite interested in employing people who are willing to work and to overlook some labor laws.''
Several tenants in the Bensonhurst building said they had held jobs that paid less than the minimum wage. The tenants, who asked that their last names be withheld because they feared being fired or deported, said they had never been paid overtime compensation, were routinely handed the least desirable tasks and were sometimes forced to work on their one free day.
''They can call me and say, 'Hey, you've got to come in tomorrow and work,' '' said Francisco, 36, who lives in Apartment 3D with his wife and two other couples, and prepares food at a nearby deli. ''There's nothing I can do. I have to go work.''
Across the country, immigrants in general are more likely to be employed than the American-born. They tend to be more willing to move in pursuit of jobs and to take any job they can find, especially if they lack access to unemployment benefits. But Mexicans in New York still stand out in employment statistics, not only in the city but also in the nation.
About 75 percent of all Mexicans in the city between ages 16 and 65 are in the civilian labor force -- either working or looking for work -- according to calculations by the sociology department at Queens College for The New York Times, based on 2008 census data. Of those, about 96 percent have jobs. Among Mexicans nationwide, that figure is 94 percent.
The employment rate just for New York's working-age Mexican men is even higher: 97 percent. Only Italians have a higher rate of employed men -- 98 percent -- though some analysts believe that the census underestimates employment rates for populations with high numbers of illegal immigrants, like Mexicans, because those without papers fear revealing their employment status.
A major reason the job rates for Mexican New Yorkers are so high is the disproportionate number of men and younger people among them, said Laird W. Bergad, director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
About three of every five Mexican immigrants of working age in the city are men, according to the census data, and more than four of every five Mexican immigrants are in their mid-teens to mid-40s. Those numbers are smaller for Mexicans nationwide -- in part, experts say, because the Mexican population in the American Southwest, where Mexican immigrants are concentrated in their greatest numbers, is more established.
Many Mexican men in New York left their wives and children behind when they came in search of jobs. Some of them say the absence of families makes it easier to endure the hardships they have faced, like poor living conditions, and to focus on work.
''Employers love them because they want to work as many hours as they can,'' said Robert C. Smith, a professor at Baruch College and a leading expert on the Mexican diaspora in New York. ''Americans expect accommodations to be made in their personal lives. But these guys have no personal lives.''
The separation can cause deep emotional stress. ''It puts tremendous strain on them,'' Mr. Smith said. ''These guys are away from their families for years at a time. There's a tremendous amount of loneliness and alcohol abuse.''
He added that while there was nothing intrinsic to their culture or character that made Mexicans better workers than others, a certain pride came with the toil.
Alex, 35, who lives with his brother and their families in Apartment 3C of the Bensonhurst building, said that the hardest tasks at the Manhattan supermarket where he works fell to him and other Mexicans at the bottom of the staff members' pecking order.
''It's not necessarily what we want to do,'' he said, ''but it's what we can get to survive.''
In New York, Mexican immigrants are most heavily concentrated in occupations that involve food preparation, according to data collated by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in New York. About 28 percent of all working-age Mexicans are in food-service jobs, while some 20 percent work in construction, the institute found.
The resilience of immigrants in New York has been put to the test during the economic downturn. According to a study released last month by the institute, unemployment rates increased for both immigrants and nonimmigrant New Yorkers from early 2008 to early 2010, but the rate for immigrants remained two percentage points lower than that of nonimmigrants.
The study also revealed that while the percentage of native-born residents in the city's labor force fell as the worsening job market led many to abandon their search for work, that rate increased for immigrants, as family members with limited or no access to welfare payments and other safety-net protections sought jobs.
Indeed, while several Mexicans in the Bensonhurst building said they had suffered cuts in hours and even days during the worst months of the recession, none said they had gone without work for more than a few days at a time.
Still, most expressed a fear that their most recent paycheck could be their last.
Agustin, 45, who lives in Apartment 1A with four other men, left his wife and children behind in Mexico when he came to the United States in 2006 to find work. He spent most of the first few years picking up construction work around Brooklyn. But with the downturn in housing construction, he looked elsewhere, finding a job this year at a supermarket in Bensonhurst.
He now works 12 hours a day, seven days a week, he said, and is paid $4 an hour, more than $3 below the minimum wage. He sends whatever he can back to Mexico.
''I have a family, so I have to work,'' he said late on a recent Sunday as he returned from his shift. He looked ragged.
''If I don't work,'' he said, ''they don't eat.''

HEADLINE: Swiss Banking Secrecy, Under Pressure, Shifts to Singapore and Hong Kong

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
For centuries, Switzerland has been the sanctuary of choice for wealthy people seeking to hide their fortunes and evade taxes. Now, amid a growing crackdown on Swiss private banking, the rich are flocking to Singapore and Hong Kong, which still offer some of the world's most secret accounts.
But there is a twist in this shift to the East: Many of the banks growing in these low-tax oases have Swiss pedigrees. And their clients are not only Asia's growing number of millionaires but also wealthy Americans and Europeans who, lawyers say, have been spooked by mounting scrutiny from the tax authorities in their own countries.
From UBS, which operates a training center in Singapore, to smaller private banks like Julius Baer, Swiss banks and those with Swiss-based operations are tripping over themselves to expand in the region. 
''We have seen a massive uptick in hiring hundreds of private bankers'' in Singapore and Hong Kong ''to take the business leaving Switzerland,'' said Raymond W. Baker, the director of Global Financial Integrity, a research institute in Washington.
Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, called the two Asian locales ''the new alternative'' to Swiss bank secrecy after the shackles placed on UBS by the United States last year.
UBS, the largest bank in Switzerland, has lost an estimated 200 billion Swiss francs, or about $200 billion, in assets from private banking clients over the last two years. But in Asia, it has won more new money than it has lost, according to an August presentation to investors by the bank's chief executive of wealth management, Jurg Zeltner.
The bank would not give actual figures. But it did say it was planning to hire an additional 400 ''client advisers,'' or private bankers, for its Asia-Pacific region, on top of the current 867.
In February, UBS raised bonuses for Singapore bankers who bring in new clients. The Singapore government is one of the bank's biggest shareholders, with about 9 percent, since diluted, bought in late 2007.
Credit Suisse's top private banking executive, Walter Berchtold, said this month that net new assets coming into the bank from rich clients in Asia would grow more than 20 percent a year, more than triple the global average the bank has forecast.
At Julius Baer, whose headquarters are in Zurich, its board met in early September in Singapore, the first such convening there.
''We call it our second home market,'' said Jan Vonder Muehll, a spokesman for Baer, adding that the bank planned to double its assets there and in Hong Kong, to 25 percent of its total, within five years. ''Swissness is highly regarded in Asia,'' he said.
Ronen Palan, a professor of political economy and an offshore finance specialist at the University of Birmingham in England, said that ''all the evidence suggests that Singapore is making a concerted effort to replace Switzerland as the global center for private banking.''
The shift has taken place amid an attack on Switzerland's private-banking industry, long a crown jewel and world leader.
In 2007, the Justice Department began a criminal investigation into UBS and, later, other Swiss banks for selling private banking services to wealthy Americans that allowed them to evade taxes.
Last year, UBS paid $780 million to settle the case. It later agreed to lift the veil of Swiss bank secrecy and disclose the names of 4,450 American clients to the Internal Revenue Service.
About the same time, European tax officials began gaining possession of discs stolen from Swiss banks that held data on thousands of clients, and a strengthened European Union directive required banks to withhold a minimum level of tax even on secret accounts.
Richard Murphy, a founder of the Tax Justice Network, a British research firm focused on offshore havens, said that amid the changes, ''Singapore is where the Swiss can now find the banking secrecy they've lost at home.''
Hong Kong, he said, is a close second.
Critics, including Mr. Murphy, point to Singapore's Swiss-style secrecy provisions; lack of taxes on capital gains and most foreign dividends; and system that allows depositors to open accounts in the guise of corporations, trusts and limited liability companies.
While Hong Kong does not have formal bank secrecy laws, it allows the formation of opaque companies that often serve as conduits for tax evasion. It also does not tax capital gains or deposit interest, and for corporations, it taxes only income produced in Hong Kong. ''Both are serious players,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''Both offer serious opacity.''
But the ''offshore haven'' label bothers both countries.
''Banking confidentiality provisions in Singapore's laws protect the privacy of legitimate investors while allowing for banking information to be provided to foreign authorities where crimes or investigations are involved,'' said Jacqueline Ong, a spokeswoman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country's central bank and financial industry regulator.
Terry Wong, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, said that Hong Kong ''should not be compared'' with jurisdictions that set out to make life easy for tax evaders.
''Hong Kong maintains a simple and highly transparent tax regime,'' she said. ''Our relatively low tax rate is a result of our prudent fiscal policy.''
But the United States tax authorities are increasingly wary.
Several UBS clients snared in the criminal investigation of the bank used Hong Kong offshore companies or had dealings with unidentified banks based in Singapore, according to court papers.
Last July, the Justice Department began investigating whether certain United States clients of HSBC, which has its headquarters in London but has large Swiss operations, had failed to disclose accounts in Singapore and India. In the spring, the I.R.S. said it was hiring 800 employees to root out tax evasion, with a focus on Hong Kong and Singapore.
Switzerland is still the global capital of undeclared offshore wealth, with about $2 trillion.
But since 2008, $520 billion has left European offshore centers, mainly Switzerland, because of the pressure in the United States on UBS and other Swiss banks, according to Wealth Bulletin, a trade publication.
''It is my impression that lots of the money that left Switzerland went to Singapore,'' said H. David Rosenbloom, a tax lawyer at Caplin Drysdale in Washington.
Singapore's private banking assets grew sixfold, to $300 billion, from 2000 to 2008, according to the Calamander Group, an investment boutique. Singapore now has about $500 billion in private banking assets, while Hong Kong has $200 billion, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
In Singapore, UBS is one of the leading private banks, with $146.5 billion in assets in the area as of last December, according to company filings.
Last year, UBS shut down what it and prosecutors called its ''United States cross-border business,'' which was offshore, undeclared private banking services for Americans.
The agreement, according to Allison Chin-Leong, a UBS spokeswoman, covers UBS's cross-border services for Americans anywhere in the world. A senior United States government official said that UBS had ''cleaned house'' and stopped offering the services to Americans through non-United States locales.
But cross-border banking at UBS is still available in Singapore and Hong Kong. In its 2009 annual report, UBS said that ''in Asia, we are directing our cross-border business on leading financial centers within the region, specifically Hong Kong and Singapore.''
The cross-border market in Singapore and Hong Kong will swell to about $800 billion in assets by 2012, UBS estimated this year. Two UBS spokeswomen did not respond to further questions over several days on whether the bank sold undeclared banking services to Europeans and other non-Americans through Asia.

HEADLINE: With Summers, Harvard Lets Bygones Be Bygones

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Katie Zezima contributed reporting from Boston.

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- He will not be moving back to Elmwood, the yellow mansion where he lived as president of Harvard, but Lawrence H. Summers will still be a big shot -- presumably a less contentious one -- when he returns to campus next year.
A day after the announcement that Mr. Summers would leave the White House, where he has spent two years as a top economic adviser to President Obama, professors, students and others on campus were already scheming to ''get a piece of Larry,'' as Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor, put it. 
For Professor Mankiw, the goal is getting Mr. Summers to be a guest speaker at his spring freshman economics seminar, known as Ec 10. ''He gives an excellent lecture that's provocative and really captures the students' imagination,'' Professor Mankiw said. ''In short order, we'll be sending him an invite.''
Mr. Summers, whose blunt, combative management style was reviled by some here, resigned as president in 2006 after a five-year tenure fraught with controversy. Most famously, he suggested in a speech that women might lack an intrinsic aptitude for math and science, setting off a firestorm on campus and across the nation.
He also drew fire for battling with Cornel West, a prominent African-American professor who left for Princeton in the wake of their fight. And Mr. Summers's brash plans for remaking Harvard did not sit well with many faculty members, whose 2005 vote of no confidence helped lead to his resignation.
But on Wednesday, as warm sun cast the campus in a golden light and the trees around Harvard Yard showed the first signs of changing hue, students and professors expressed little enmity for Mr. Summers or angst about his return. Several students said they were eager to take one of his classes, though it remained unclear what he would teach.
''There are definitely a lot of people talking about it,'' said Jonathan Padilla, a junior who is majoring in government and was an intern at the White House this summer. ''He'll be able to speak his mind on economic policy versus what the administration wants put out there.''
Richard Zeckhauser, a professor of political economy at the Kennedy School of Government and a friend of Mr. Summers, predicted that he would teach a survey-type course focused on both the world and the domestic economy.
''He'll talk more than he used to about what goes on in Columbus, Ohio, and the Silicon Valley and Las Vegas,'' Professor Zeckhauser said. ''He will have more to say, I presume, about his recent experience, though he will be somewhat circumspect. I'd be very surprised if he came here and said, 'I think that what we did on such-and-such was a terrible idea.' ''
Professor Zeckhauser said that despite his feuds with the Harvard faculty, Mr. Summers was well liked by students and would probably engage with them as much as possible upon his return. During his presidency, students were known to chant his name at football games and ask him to sign dollar bills that bore his signature from his time as President Bill Clinton's secretary of the Treasury.
In 2003, according to the Harvard Crimson, Mr. Summers not only showed up at a freshman dance but danced to the hip-hop song ''Hot in Herre'' by Nelly.
James Kloppenberg, a history professor, said that the raw feelings that pervaded the campus during much of Mr. Summers's presidency had faded and that he would be welcomed back even though some bitterness remained.
''I thought he made serious mistakes,'' Professor Kloppenberg said, ''and I thought he compounded the problems by refusing to concede his errors. But I think having to leave the presidency was penalty enough. I think many people, even those who don't particularly like him, realize he's an unusually able economist and earned his place on the faculty.''
Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor who almost followed Mr. West to Princeton in 2002, said he was not surprised to hear of Mr. Summers's return, because ''the idea of leaving Harvard is more than most people can bear.''
''I've had my battles with Larry,'' Professor Gates said. ''But during our battles I grew to admire him very much, even when I most disagreed with him. He's a smart, rigorous thinker and he loves Harvard -- it's obvious.''
Professor Zeckhauser said Cambridge would keep Mr. Summers happy because ''we're sort of like the Yankees and the Red Sox rolled together in terms of economists.''
He predicted that Mr. Summers, whose wife, Elisa New, is a Harvard English professor, would play a lot of tennis and go out for meals with old friends, though not at fancy places.
''I don't expect to walk into L'Espalier,'' he said, referring to one of Boston's most vaunted restaurants, ''and see Larry and his wife at the next table. He's not a gourmet eater.''
Professor Gates said he hoped that Mr. Summers would once again have a burger named for him at Mr. Bartley's, a beloved Harvard Square restaurant. The Larry Summers burger, topped with Swiss cheese and honey mustard, was removed from the menu after he resigned as president.
But Bill Bartley, the general manager, was noncommittal Wednesday, saying Mr. Summers would thrive back at Harvard regardless. ''I don't think Larry needs my help,'' Mr. Bartley said.

HEADLINE: CHINA'S DISPUTES IN ASIA BUTTRESS INFLUENCE OF U.S.

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Michael Wines contributed reporting from Beijing, and Martin Fackler from Tokyo. Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- For the last several years, one big theme has dominated talk of the future of Asia: As China rises, its neighbors are being inevitably drawn into its orbit, currying favor with the region's new hegemonic power.
The presumed loser, of course, is the United States, whose wealth and influence are being spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and whose economic troubles have eroded its standing in a more dynamic Asia.
But rising frictions between China and its neighbors in recent weeks over security issues have handed the United States an opportunity to reassert itself -- one the Obama administration has been keen to take advantage of.
Washington is leaping into the middle of heated territorial disputes between China and Southeast Asian nations despite stern Chinese warnings that it mind its own business. The United States is carrying out naval exercises with South Korea in order to help Seoul rebuff threats from North Korea even though China is denouncing those exercises, saying that they intrude on areas where the Chinese military operates. 
Meanwhile, China's increasingly tense standoff with Japan over a Chinese fishing trawler captured by Japanese ships in disputed waters is pushing Japan back under the American security umbrella.
The arena for these struggles is shifting this week to a summit meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, has refused to meet with his Japanese counterpart, Naoto Kan, and on Tuesday he threatened Japan with ''further action'' if it did not unconditionally release the fishing captain.
On Friday, President Obama is expected to meet with Southeast Asian leaders and promise that the United States is willing to help them peacefully settle South China Sea territorial disputes with China.
''The U.S. has been smart,'' said Carlyle A. Thayer, a professor at the Australian Defense Force Academy who studies security issues in Asia. ''It has done well by coming to the assistance of countries in the region.''
''All across the board, China is seeing the atmospherics change tremendously,'' he added. ''The idea of the China threat, thanks to its own efforts, is being revived.''
Asserting Chinese sovereignty over borderlands in contention -- everywhere from Tibet to Taiwan to the South China Sea -- has long been the top priority for Chinese nationalists, an obsession that overrides all other concerns. But this complicates China's attempts to present the country's rise as a boon for the whole region and creates wedges between China and its neighbors.
Nothing underscores that better than the escalating diplomatic conflict between China and Japan over the detention of the Chinese fishing captain, Zhan Qixiong, by the Japanese authorities, who say the captain rammed two Japanese vessels around the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. The islands are administered by Japan but claimed by both Japan and China.
The current dispute may strengthen the military alliance between the United States and Japan, as did an incident last April when a Chinese helicopter buzzed a Japanese destroyer. Such confrontations tend to remind Japanese officials, who have suggested that they need to refocus their foreign policy on China instead of America, that they rely on the United States to balance an unpredictable China, analysts say.
''Japan will have no choice but to further go into America's arms, to further beef up the U.S.-Japan alliance and its military power,'' said Huang Jing, a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore.
In July, Southeast Asian nations, particularly Vietnam, applauded when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the United States was willing to help mediate a solution to disputes that those nations had with China over the South China Sea, which is rich in oil, natural gas and fish. China insists on dealing with Southeast Asian nations one on one, but Mrs. Clinton said the United States supported multilateral talks. Freedom of navigation in the sea is an American national interest, she said.
President Obama meets on Friday with leaders from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean. The Associated Press reported that the participants would issue a joint statement opposing the ''use or threat of force by any claimant attempting to enforce disputed claims in the South China Sea.'' The statement is clearly aimed at China, which has seized Vietnamese fishing vessels in recent years and detained their crews.
On Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, criticized any attempt at mediation by the United States. ''We firmly oppose any country having nothing to do with the South China Sea issue getting involved in the dispute,'' she said at a news conference in Beijing.
China has also been objecting to American plans to hold military exercises with South Korea in the Yellow Sea, which China claims as its exclusive military operations zone. The United States and South Korea want to send a stern message to North Korea over what Seoul says was the torpedoing last March of a South Korean warship by a North Korean submarine. China's belligerence serves only to reinforce South Korea's dependence on the American military.
American officials are increasingly concerned about the modernization of China's navy and its long-range abilities, as well as China's growing assertiveness in the surrounding waters. In March, a Chinese official told White House officials that the South China Sea was part of China's ''core interest'' of sovereignty, similar to Tibet and Taiwan, an American official said in an interview at the time. American officials also object to China's telling foreign oil companies not to work with Vietnam on developing oil fields in the South China Sea.
Some Chinese military leaders and analysts see an American effort to contain China. Feng Zhaokui, a Japan scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in an article on Tuesday in The Global Times, a populist newspaper, that the United States was trying to ''nurture a coalition against China.''
In August, Rear Adm. Yang Yi wrote an editorial for The PLA Daily, published by the Chinese Army, in which he said that on one hand, Washington ''wants China to play a role in regional security issues.''
''On the other hand,'' he continued, ''it is engaging in an increasingly tight encirclement of China and is constantly challenging China's core interests.''
Asian countries suspicious of Chinese intentions see Washington as a natural ally. In April, the incident involving the Chinese helicopter and Japanese destroyer spooked many in Japan, making them feel vulnerable at a time when Yukio Hatoyama, then the prime minister, had angered Washington with his pledges to relocate a Marine Corps air base away from Okinawa.
His successor, Mr. Kan, has sought to smooth out ties with Washington and has emphasized that the alliance is the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy.
''Insecurity about China's presence has served as a wake-up call on the importance of the alliance,'' said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of public policy at the University of Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Chronically Ill, and Covered

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Joe and Mary Thompson had agreed to adopt Emily before her birth in 1999, and it never occurred to them to back out when she was born with spina bifida. But that same year, their residential remodeling business in Overland Park, Kan., went under, prompting job changes that left the family searching for health coverage with a child who was uninsurable. 
The insurers were willing to cover the Thompsons and their older daughter, but not Emily, who was later discovered to have mild autism as well, or her 13-year-old brother, who had a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder.
Starting Thursday, the insurers will not be able to do that, as the new health care law prohibits them from denying coverage to children under 19 because of pre-existing health conditions. In 2014, the change will extend to people of all ages.
''It really is a pinch-me moment,'' said Mrs. Thompson, who is 50. ''Could it possibly be, after all these years of fighting and jumping through hoops and trying to find the right place to help us out, that she could just be put on our policy with her sister and not be discriminated against any more?''
Mrs. Thompson cannot yet answer her question. She is waiting for clear information from her insurer, Humana, about how much it will cost to add Emily to the family's $565-a-month policy. One agent told her on the phone that rates could be as much as five times normal prices, she said, effectively making Emily just as uninsurable as ever.
The law does not prevent insurers from charging more to cover those with chronic conditions until 2014. Some carriers have responded to the provision by ending the sale of child-only policies.
The Thompsons were fortunate that Children's Mercy Hospital, across the Missouri line in Kansas City, agreed years ago to take Emily as a charity case for her annual rounds of testing, which run nearly $10,000. They were charged only $10.
But they have lived in fear that Emily would wind up in an emergency room, or that the recession would sap the hospital's generosity, or that Children's Mercy would disqualify them if their income rose. Emily had on several occasions been kicked off the state's Children's Health Insurance Program because the family's income nudged just above eligibility limits.
''Every family has a bit of anxiety around tax time,'' Mrs. Thompson said. ''We've had the additional stress of wondering where we fall regarding qualification cutoffs.''

HEADLINE: For Many Families, Health Care Relief Begins Today

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Sometimes lost in the partisan clamor about the new health care law is the profound relief it is expected to bring to hundreds of thousands of Americans who have been stricken first by disease and then by a Darwinian insurance system.
On Thursday, the six-month anniversary of the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a number of its most central consumer protections take effect, just in time for the midterm elections. 
Starting now, insurance companies will no longer be permitted to exclude children because of pre-existing health conditions, which the White House said could enable 72,000 uninsured to gain coverage. Insurers also will be prohibited from imposing lifetime limits on benefits.
The law will now forbid insurers to drop sick and costly customers after discovering technical mistakes on applications. It requires that they offer coverage to children under 26 on their parents' policies.
It establishes a menu of preventive procedures, like colonoscopies, mammograms and immunizations, that must be covered without co-payments. And it allows consumers who join a new plan to keep their own doctors and to appeal insurance company reimbursement decisions to a third party.
The arrival of the long-awaited changes propelled President Obama, whose Democrats have struggled to exploit their signature achievement, into the backyard of Paul and Frances Brayshaw of Falls Church, Va., to explain his decision to pursue health care.
''The amount of vulnerability that was out there was horrendous,'' Mr. Obama on Wednesday told a gathering of people chosen to illustrate the law's new provisions. He said he concluded that ''we've just got to give people some basic peace of mind.''
Mr. Obama also responded to Republican Congressional leaders who have campaigned on a threat to repeal the act. ''I want them to look you in the eye,'' he told his audience, and explain their opposition to a law that is projected to cover 32 million uninsured and reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10 years.
The Republican strategy ''makes sense in terms of politics and polls,'' Mr. Obama said, an acknowledgment that the electorate is divided and that many swing districts are hostile. ''It just doesn't make sense in terms of actually making people's lives better.''
House Republicans continued to question Mr. Obama's assertions, which he repeated Wednesday, that the law will lower premiums, pointing to double-digit increases recently announced by many insurers. A blog posting on the Web site of the minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, predicted the law would ''raise health care costs, explode the federal deficit and create a byzantine bureaucracy.''
The administration has estimated that premiums should rise no more than 2 percent because of the new consumer protections, and warned this month that it would have ''zero tolerance'' for efforts to blame the law for larger increases.
It will take years to determine the act's long-term impact on American health, and on American politics. But Democrats did manage to front-load some notable benefits, while deferring the pain of tax increases and penalties until after the election.
Polls have found that many of the provisions taking effect Thursday are popular, tugging at a national sense of fairness and feeding off distrust of health insurers. They bear particular appeal for the 14 million people who must buy policies on the individual market rather than through employers and are thus at the mercy of the industry. And they land on the heels of a government report showing that the recession drove the number of uninsured Americans to 50.7 million in 2009, up 10 percent in a year.
As the political battle endures, those most immediately affected are welcoming the changes with collective relief, and hoping that their promise of security is real.

HEADLINE: For Economic Team, A Chance to Retool

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and his top aides have already begun to discuss how a successor for Lawrence H. Summers, the chief economic gatekeeper inside the White House, can help reshape the administration's economic team without signaling major changes in policy, either to markets or voters.
Senior aides said Wednesday that no decision was imminent, and that Mr. Summers would remain in charge of the flow of economic information to Mr. Obama until the end of December. But they said it was clear that a new director of the National Economic Council would offer different strengths as the country confronts a new set of economic challenges. Officials dampened speculation that the search had already centered on a short list mainly of corporate chiefs or bankers.
But White House officials said the president was likely to consider business experience and to look for women who might fill the post.
''There is not a secret list taped to the bottom of a desk,'' said Jen Psaki, the deputy communications director at the White House. ''The president will consider a range of options for the position, but the most important quality is, who is the best person for the job? Who is the right member of the team?'' 
Since Mr. Summers's departure had been anticipated internally -- he had said he needed to return to Harvard by January to retain his tenure -- White House officials led by Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, had been giving thought to candidates who would give the administration more credibility with the business community.
Mr. Summers's replacement will also have to help repair the political damage that Mr. Obama has sustained from the government's early response to the economic crisis, championed by Mr. Summers, and the extended period of high unemployment and economic uncertainty. The new economic team will take over at the start of a politically treacherous phase that includes the president's re-election campaign.
Even as the lineup shifts, what is clear is that the one member of Mr. Obama's original economic quartet who will remain, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, emerges as the team's unquestioned captain, assuring a measure of continuity in the face of the administration's critics.
Mr. Geithner acquires that status not only because he is outlasting the others but because he has gained the president's confidence for his stewardship despite brickbats from the political right and left, administration officials say. After a rocky start in 2009 that prompted much speculation that Mr. Geithner would be the first to leave, and not voluntarily, now officials say he could well stay through Mr. Obama's term.
The question before Mr. Obama, aides say, is how to find someone who brings the breadth of economic knowledge of Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, while at the same time reaching out broadly for new approaches.
''Larry was a spectacular guy for the crisis,'' said David Axelrod, special adviser to the president. ''There isn't a person alive with a greater sweep of knowledge and insight than Larry. I don't expect that we are going to find another Larry Summers. Circumstances have changed.''
Said Mr. Geithner, in an interview, ''There is no other Larry Summers on the planet,'' adding, ''That model is not replicable.''
As an intellect, Mr. Summers was an unmatched powerhouse inside the White House, providing input on a wide range of domestic issues that included the stimulus package, the budget and the rescue of the auto industry, but also international economics; he recently returned from a trip to China. Among the issues he felt free to express his views on were health care, climate change and housing.
But as the person charged with managing the economic debate inside the White House, Mr. Summers is seen by some in the administration as a powerful voice who often overpowered the views of others, even as he presented those views to the president for consideration.
Some colleagues called him Dr. No for being so quick to shoot down others' economic policy ideas while putting too few of his own on the table. And while they credit Mr. Summers for exploring all sides of an economic issue, they complained that he took so long doing that he wore out even the president's patience on occasion -- as in the development of Mr. Obama's recent package of incentives for business investments and for financing job-creating infrastructure projects.
Mr. Summers inspired loyalty among his staff and admiration inside the West Wing for a man whose ambition and resume always seemed a bit out of sync with his bureaucratic title of director at the National Economic Council. It is a job intended for someone who is particularly skilled at managing staff and information, a skill some thought Mr. Summers lacked.
''Is he the most organized person on the planet? No,'' said one Washington Democrat with close ties to the White House, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal administration staff issues. ''Is he the best person to run a process? No. And is that pivotal when you are running 17 things in the middle of a crisis? Absolutely.''
To allies of Mr. Summers, his style should have come as little surprise to the president. In a phone call before he accepted the job, Mr. Summers promised Mr. Obama that he would present all views, but said, ''I will have strong views, which I will want to share with you and to share with others,'' according to people familiar with the conversation.
News of his departure emerged earlier than White House officials had expected, in part by design of Mr. Summers, who had not wanted his leaving to be seen as a repudiation of his tenure if it came after expected Democratic losses in the midterm elections.
But the White House is well along in rebuilding a team. Mr. Geithner has had several conversations with Mr. Obama in their private, weekly meetings about how to reconstitute the core group of economic advisers in the latter half of the president's term. ''Tim, Rahm and Larry and the president have given it a lot of thought,'' said one senior adviser close to all four.
The new team is already emerging.
In a further sign of continuity, Mr. Obama named two people from within his administration to fill the vacancies of Christina D. Romer, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Peter R. Orszag, the first budget director.
The administration on Wednesday also named Tim Massad, a Treasury official, as acting director to replace Herbert M. Allison Jr., who served as director of the Treasury's office of financial stability. Mr. Allison had overseen the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Austan D. Goolsbee, a campaign adviser who was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, was promoted this month to succeed Ms. Romer. And the president nominated Jack Lew, a deputy secretary of state, to be the new budget director -- a job he already held at the end of the Clinton administration, a time of budget surpluses.

HEADLINE: Chinese Leader Fields Executives' Questions

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
When Bill Gates confronts the prime minister of China on the need to honor software copyrights, it helps to have a referee -- say, a Henry Kissinger -- to moderate the debate.
That, in fact, is what happened at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Wednesday morning in Midtown Manhattan.
In a remarkable 90-minute meeting, with Mr. Kissinger playing M.C., Mr. Gates and other heavyweight executives and economists from the West engaged Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. He listened patiently, and often volleyed back, on topics including currency and trade policies, foreign investment and whether China needed to improve its social safety net. 
Others in the circle -- literally a large ring of a few dozen chairs -- included Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase; Lloyd C. Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs chief; Joseph Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel in economics; Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief of American Express; and PepsiCo's chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi.
China's top leaders rarely meet Western executives. But Mr. Wen, in New York for a session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly, agreed to sit down with the group, possibly in the hope of helping ease growing tensions between the United States and China over various issues.
The session, which Chinese officials called a dialogue with ''economic celebrities,'' was civil and respectful. But there were some pointed words for the Chinese leader, who listened and spoke through an interpreter.
Mr. Chenault told Mr. Wen that the most important asset American companies have is their brand. Seeming to hint that Chinese companies were competing unfairly, Mr. Chenault asked the prime minister for his views on brand value.
Mr. Wen responded, ''We will never usurp others' brands.''
Ms. Nooyi of PepsiCo told Mr. Wen that China should create incentives for companies to build factories to high environmental standards. She also said that her company had invested billions of dollars in China and was already his country's biggest private potato grower, and she asked whether American companies would get equal treatment to Chinese companies there.
The prime minister replied, ''You put forward two good proposals, and the Chinese government will accept these.''
Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, contended that China's huge trade surpluses with the United States could have disastrous consequences.
''The trade imbalances are unsustainable,'' Mr. Rubin told Mr. Wen, urging China to restructure its economy away from exports and toward domestic consumption. ''And this trade imbalance is creating political problems'' in the United States.
Mr. Wen acknowledged that global imbalances were a problem, and said Beijing was working to make changes. But he took issue with the widely held idea that China takes the largest share of trade benefits.
''An iPod is sold at $299, and China in the manufacturing link will only get $6 for it,'' he said. The implication was clear: The bulk of the profits in producing the item accrue to Apple and others in the supply chain.
On one of the most contentious issues -- China's currency policy -- Mr. Wen had little to say. But Wednesday evening, in a separate speech to a group of dignitaries involved in United States-China relations, Mr. Wen said more sharply that China's exchange rate was not the problem, and indicated that China would continue to resist pressure from Washington.
''There is no basis for a drastic appreciation of the renminbi,'' he said. ''You don't know how many Chinese companies would go bankrupt. There would be major disturbances. Only the Chinese premier has such pressure on his shoulders. This is the reality.''
It is a topic likely to come up when he and President Obama meet in New York on Thursday on the sidelines of the United Nations. China has repeatedly signaled that it would like to move toward a more flexible currency, and Mr. Wen said Wednesday that China did not ''intentionally'' seek a huge trade surplus -- something that critics say Beijing does by keeping its currency, the renminbi, artificially cheap.
But while China has allowed the renminbi to appreciate slightly against the dollar this year, China's trade is booming again.
Several of the Americans at the Waldorf on Wednesday warned that the United States' sluggish economy and high unemployment rate were inflaming protectionist sentiment in this country and could lead Congress to impose tough trade sanctions or other measures.
Stephen Roach, a Morgan Stanley economist and a teacher at Yale, warning that American politicians were threatening to take the ''low road,'' urged Mr. Wen to ignore calls for China to fix its currency and instead focus on pushing for ''pro-consumption'' policies at home. That, Mr. Roach said, would allow the Chinese to consume more -- and also buy more American goods.
As for Mr. Gates, he said that he was preparing to travel to China for the Gates Foundation, his philanthropy, but that he also wanted to press a long-running concern about counterfeiting of American software and other intellectual property in China.
After saying that Microsoft's research lab was progressing well in China, Mr. Gates said: ''I'll mention one thing that is not going well, and that's related to the enforcement of intellectual property, such as copyright. If you look at the numbers, over the last five years there hasn't been much progress.''
Mr. Wen took the question in stride. ''Mr. Gates,'' he said. ''You are a business person I hold in high regard. You also have morality running in your veins. I fully support the Gates Foundation.''
Then, Mr. Wen -- who is called Grandpa Wen in China because of his populist approach and habit of racing to the scene of natural disasters to comfort victims -- applied his charms on Mr. Gates.
''I do admit these problems exist,'' Mr. Wen said. ''We have to put in administrative measures. I think we should have higher moral and ethical standards in this matter.''

HEADLINE: Missed Goals

 BODY:
Ten years ago, leaders of rich and poor countries pledged to build a better world by 2015. Among their vital goals: halving extreme poverty and hunger from 1990 levels, reducing by two-thirds the child-mortality rate and slashing maternal mortality by three-quarters and achieving universal primary education.
As they gathered at the United Nations this week, world leaders had to admit that their progress ''falls far short of what is needed'' to meet those targets by the deadline. The global recession set many countries back. But rich nations -- including the United States -- have not contributed the money needed to make this a reality. 
The best way we can see of turning this around is for wealthy nations to make a generous and concrete pledge of aid for the next five years -- and then deliver. The 0.7 percent of gross domestic product endorsed by world leaders in 2002 is a good place to start. Unfortunately, the United States and many others, including Italy, Germany and Japan, fall far short of that.
It was disappointing that President Obama made no hard commitment to increase development aid when he addressed the United Nations conference on Wednesday. The legalistic claims by some of his aides that the United States never really signed on to hard aid targets sends precisely the wrong message. If Washington isn't willing to fully ante up, there is little hope others will.
Still there was a lot in Mr. Obama's speech that made good sense to us. He made a compelling case for why foreign aid is an essential component of an effective national security strategy. And he outlined a promising new policy to bring coherence to the often incoherent American foreign aid and development system.
He said the United States would still be a major donor but would put new emphasis on using all of its tools -- including trade and export credits -- to help poor countries get to the point where they don't need assistance. He also, rightly, promised to hold recipient countries accountable for improving governance and combating corruption and to be ''more selective and focus our efforts where we have the best partners and where we can have the greatest impact.'' That, too, is essential.
The meager progress on the so-called Millennium Development Goals underscores why more effective aid is so important but also why more money is needed.
The best news is that the share of people living on less than $1.25 a day seems on track to meet the goal of halving the extreme poverty rate. But most of those gains have occurred in China and other East Asian countries. Poverty rates in sub-Saharan Africa remain way too high. The world is far behind on many other goals.
Between 1990 and 2008, the mortality rate of children under 5 in developing countries declined only from 10 percent to 7.2 percent -- far from the target of a two-thirds reduction by 2015. Maternal mortality declined only from 480 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 450 deaths in 2005. The 2015 goal is closer to 120. Enrollment in primary education reached only 89 percent in 2008, up from 80 percent in 1991.
Nobody can know how much money is needed to meet these and other urgent development goals. But, in 2002, rich donor countries agreed that contributions of 0.7 percent of their G.D.P. was, at least, politically feasible. Today, only Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have met the goal. In 2009, the United States channeled 0.2 percent of its G.D.P. to aid. On average, development assistance amounted to only 0.31 percent of G.D.P. of developed nations last year.
On Wednesday, world leaders again urged developed countries to meet this aid target by 2015. Talk is cheap. They have to deliver.

HEADLINE: In an Effort to Reconnect, Obama Heads Into the Backyard

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
FALLS CHURCH, Va. -- President Obama is trying to reconnect with the American people, and he is using that most American of settings, the backyard, to do it.
Mr. Obama emerged from the back door of Paul and Frances Brayshaw's tidy white brick house here on Wednesday and trotted down some steps onto their patio under a bright noonday sun with a hearty ''Hey, everybody! Hello, hello, hello! Good to see you.'' About two dozen guests awaited him in lawn chairs for what was supposed to be a casual conversation on health care and, more broadly, the American economy.
It was Mr. Obama's third such ''backyard conversation'' in recent weeks, and there are more in store. Another three backyard drop-ins are planned for next week, when Mr. Obama travels to New Mexico, Wisconsin and Iowa, and there will be more throughout the campaign season -- part of what his aides describe as a concerted push to get him out of the White House to mingle with everyday Americans and hear their concerns.
But as Wednesday's event made clear, little of what Mr. Obama does is truly unscripted. 
Thursday marks six months since the signing of his landmark health bill, and is the day many of its most popular provisions go into effect. Half the guests were neighbors of the Brayshaws; the other half -- who, along with the president, did all the talking -- were handpicked by the administration and came from around the country to share exactly the kind of stories the White House wants to tell, personal tales of how the bill had improved their lives.
A cancer patient who had been uninsured told Mr. Obama she had joined a high-risk pool and now has coverage for her chemotherapy and radiation. A mother told the president that her son, who had a disorder that required repeated eye operations, could now get insurance because the law bars companies from excluding children with pre-existing conditions. An elderly woman told Mr. Obama that she paid for her heart medication with a $250 government rebate check.
''That's a wonderful story,'' the president said.
''And I thank you from the bottom of my heart,'' the woman replied.
The White House says that Wednesday's event was the exception, and that the other backyard visits will feature guests picked by the homeowner, along with some local elected officials.
Representative Jim Moran, Democrat of Virginia, who has attended two of Mr. Obama's backyard conversations, said he was surprised that one in Fairfax last week brought together people who had neither been vetted nor coached. And when Mr. Obama appeared on CNBC earlier this week for a question-and-answer session, he got an earful from supporters who expressed deep unease about the economy, and in some cases, discontent with his performance.
''I think he is getting a sense of the dissatisfaction that those of us running for re-election have been exposed to,'' Mr. Moran said. He added, ''I think it's kind of a high-risk strategy, frankly, for these to be genuine backyard meetings because as all of us have found out through unfortunate experiences, you can get sacked with some pretty tough questions.''
One complaint that many Democrats, including Mr. Moran, have about Mr. Obama is that he often comes off looking professorial and distant. ''I would like to see him be a lot less cerebral, and a little more emotional,'' Mr. Moran said.
Republicans say the backyard visits will not fix that. Kenneth Duberstein, who served as chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan -- and who broke with his party in 2008 to support Mr. Obama -- said Mr. Obama ''doesn't look natural in these settings.'' He added, ''He needs more Ray's Hell Burgers and less candlelight dinners,'' referring to the president's occasional, and highly publicized, jaunts to a local burger joint.
From a presidential image-making perspective, the backyard visits are kind of like Ray's Hell Burger trips without the food. The idea is to put the president in settings where he can have ''an intimate conversation,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, his communications director, ''with middle-class Americans about how the economy is affecting their everyday lives.''
But intimacy is hard to come by for someone who travels with the Secret Service and a horde of television cameras. And at least on Wednesday, just before he addressed the United Nations in New York, Mr. Obama did not seem to encourage a wide-ranging conversation. After telling his audience that he wanted to ''open it up for any questions, comments, concerns that people have,'' he went on to say, ''We're focused mostly on health care, but if you want me to talk about what happened to the Redskins on Sunday, I can talk about that, too.''
There were no questions about the Redskins, and none on the economy either. One of the Brayshaw's neighbors, Laura Wilson, said before the president's arrival that she had voted for his Republican opponent in 2008, and was impressed that the White House had told her she could ask anything she wanted.
But she and the other neighbors were either too polite or nervous to speak up.
The backyard conversations come at a time when Republicans are trying to paint Mr. Obama as disconnected from, and different than, ordinary Americans. Conservative pundits like Glenn Beck have questioned Mr. Obama's Christianity. (As if to prove them wrong, Mr. Obama went to church last weekend.)
Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, has taken swipes at Mr. Obama's Kenyan background, while Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi recently told reporters that Americans know less about Mr. Obama than ''any other president in American history.'' (The governor said he had not read the president's autobiography, ''Dreams from My Father.'')
Mr. Pfeiffer said it would be a mistake to ''connect the idea that we are going to backyards to talk to people as having anything to do with what Haley Barbour or Newt Gingrich has to say.'' Rather, he said, Mr. Obama enjoys the visits -- they remind him of his days as a candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire, when he traveled without a huge entourage -- and wants to ''understand in a very visceral way the challenges that people are facing.'' They are also good politics.
''So much of the imagery that you see is the president in the East Room, behind a podium talking at people,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said. ''That is the nature of communicating from the White House. It's good to get out of here.''

HEADLINE: If His Chief of Staff Departs, Obama Will Get the Chance to Send a Signal

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
By all knowledgeable accounts, Rahm Emanuel hasn't yet decided whether he will leave his job as White House chief of staff to run for mayor of Chicago. But that hasn't dampened the intense speculation in Washington on the question of who might replace him.
This is largely because the selection of a chief of staff signals the direction of a presidency. Whether Democrats lose control of Congress this November or simply emerge weakened, President Obama will likely confront a changed political environment. And so Mr. Obama's potential choice for a second chief of staff would say a lot about the kind of strategy he intends to pursue for the rest of his term -- and whether he is ready, perhaps, to challenge the worldview that permeates his White House. 
Modern presidencies tend to unfold in chapters, after all. Don Baer, who served as communications director in the Clinton White House, points out that there were four distinct phases in Bill Clinton's presidency: the initial legislative phase, the post-Republican takeover phase, the impeachment phase and the post-impeachment phase. These phases corresponded roughly, though not exactly, with Mr. Clinton's four chiefs of staff, all of whom came with attributes that seemed to fit the particular moment.
Given his Chicago ties and his experience in both the legislative and executive branches, Mr. Emanuel was perhaps an ideal choice for Mr. Obama's young presidency. Mr. Emanuel has presided over a string of significant legislative victories, and there is no sign that Mr. Obama is inclined to send his chief of staff packing, no matter what happens in November.
And yet, should Mr. Emanuel leave soon, whether to run for mayor or simply from exhaustion, it would create an opportunity for Mr. Obama to signal that he is opening a new chapter in his administration. The departures of many of his top economic aides, including Lawrence H. Summers, who announced Tuesday that he would return to Harvard by the end of the year, has already set that process in motion.
''I happen to be a big Rahm fan,'' says David Gergen, a senior advisor to four previous presidents. ''But going forward, I think the president can make a choice that can help revive and reposition his presidency.''
Perhaps the pivotal choice that will face Mr. Obama, should he need to name a new chief of staff, is whether to select someone from inside or outside his circle of advisors.
Most of the potential picks whose names keep popping up in Washington speculation are aides on whom the president already relies. These include personal loyalists like Valerie Jarrett, the president's senior advisor and longtime friend, and David Plouffe, his former campaign manager, as well as such experienced Washington hands as Tom Donilon, a top national security aide, and Robert Bauer, Mr. Obama's White House counsel.
The argument here is that an administration insider would already have a rapport with the president and his senior staff, which might be important, since the last thing the president would need, as he settles in for a protracted struggle with congressional Republicans, is a lot of internal strife.
And yet, advisors from previous administrations will tell you that one of the great perils for a White House, as for any powerful institution in trying times, is that its leaders tend to share the same insular perspective on how they got were they are. They become, in a sense, prisoners of their own narrative.
Lyndon Johnson and his advisors, for instance, found themselves trapped inside their shared view of how to fight the Vietnam War. It was only after Johnson brought in advisors grounded in outside thinking -- most notably Clark Clifford -- that the White House began to bend to reality and seek new approaches to the conflict.
In Mr. Obama's case, the administration's groupthink is more subtle. Talk to any senior White House aide, and you will hear the same essential narrative of the past 18 months -- how President George W. Bush and his Wall Street friends bequeathed to Mr. Obama crises of unforeseen proportions, how Republicans tried to derail efforts to address them, how none of the president's predicaments are of his own making. Even when they acknowledge missteps, Mr. Obama's aides tend to see them, to borrow a legal term, as fruit of the poisonous tree -- that is, missteps that would not have occurred were it not for the misery they inherited.
The problem with this interpretation of events isn't that people don't believe it. In the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, a clear majority of Americans, 58 percent, blamed either Mr. Bush or financial institutions for the current economic morass, compared with only 5 percent who blamed Mr. Obama.
Rather, the danger in such a worldview is that it seems to have created a aggrieved mentality inside the White House that probably isn't very helpful. Voters may not believe it was Mr. Obama who caused their current travails, but neither do they seem interested in the question of who did. They are judging the administration solely now on the effectiveness of its response to crises, rather than on its culpability.
If he ends up choosing a new chief of staff, then, Mr. Obama could opt for someone who may be more attuned to recent shifts in the public's attitude, perhaps a former governor who has executive mindset and doesn't share the experience of his inner circle. Among the names I heard suggested in recent weeks are Virginia's Tim Kaine, who runs the Democratic National Committee, and Ed Rendell, the soon-to-be former governor of Pennsylvania.
Of course, Mr. Obama could try to pursue both the inside and outside paths at once, by bringing in new advisors in senior positions while also replacing Mr. Emanuel -- if and when he leaves -- with a current aide. If Mr. Obama has established any management pattern to this point, it is that he generally seeks to broaden his options even while preserving continuity -- to demonstrate that he is, in effect, less intractable than Mr. Bush but also less politically malleable than Mr. Clinton.
Such a dual strategy would not exactly open a new chapter in Mr. Obama's presidency. But it might at least signal a willingness to turn the page.

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s DeMint Adds To His Agenda

BYLINE: By DAVID HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, who has flexed his political muscle by backing victorious Tea Party candidates in Republican primaries across the nation, introduced legislation on Wednesday aimed at restricting the ability of federal agencies to issue new regulations. 
Mr. DeMint has accused the Obama administration of strangling various sectors of the economy with onerous regulations, and his bill would require Congressional approval of any new ''major rule'' - that is any regulation that ''may result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.''
The bill is called the Reins Act, which stands for Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny.
In a statement, Mr. DeMint said: ''We must put a stop to the reckless and costly anti-free market regulations that are destroying jobs. When the Obama Administration hasn't been able to ram their anti-job polices through Congress, they've empowered unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to force them through using regulations. From the ongoing attempts to control the environment and the Internet to the forthcoming barrage of regulations facing the health care and financial industry, it's no wonder that consumer costs are rising and businesses are reluctant to invest and grow.''
While the bill has no chance of moving forward with Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress, it would likely get some attention if Republicans win a majority in the House in November.
Mr. DeMint announced 12 Republican co-sponsors of the bill: Tom Coburn of Oklahoma; John Cornyn of Texas; John Ensign of Nevada; Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming; Charles E. Grassley of Iowa; Orrin G. Hatch of Utah; James Inhofe of Oklahoma; Jim Risch of Idaho; Jeff Sessions of Alabama; John Thune of South Dakota; David Vitter of Louisiana; and Roger Wicker of Mississippi.
Representative Geoff Davis, Republican of Kentucky, plans to propose similar legislation in the House.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: At U.N., Turkey Asserts Itself on World Stage

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- If the United NationsGeneral Assembly often serves as a stage for ambitious countries to project a new image, none has grabbed that opportunity this year with as much vigor as Turkey.
In a flurry of speeches and meetings -- and one meeting that did not happen -- the Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, defended his country's close ties to Iran, proclaimed Turkey's intention to become a leader in the Muslim world, and spurned an attempt to mend fences with Israel over its deadly raid on an aid flotilla bound for Gaza.
Turkey's muscle-flexing has left the United States uneasy, with administration officials worried that Iran had obtained access to financing for its nuclear program through Turkish banks, and that Turkey's rift with Israel could complicate American efforts to make peace in the Middle East. 
Israeli officials reached out to Turkey to arrange a meeting this week between Mr. Gul and the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, in New York. But it collapsed amid Israeli claims that Turkey had demanded an apology from Mr. Peres for the flotilla raid and Turkish claims that Mr. Gul had no time -- all of which inflamed a sore that the Israelis hoped had been gradually healing.
Turkey's leaders made no apologies, saying they did not start the fight with Israel. Nor are they shy about Turkey's ambitions, declaring that its status as a Muslim democracy, its growing economy, and its location at the hinge of Europe and Asia should make it a central player in resolving problems like the Iranian nuclear program and the Middle East conflict. ''If you look at all the issues that are of importance to the world today,'' Mr. Gul said in an interview on Tuesday, ''they have put Turkey in a rather more advantageous position.'' Turkey, Mr. Gul said, was the ''only country that can have a very important contribution to the diplomatic route'' with Iran -- a clear reference to its effort, along with Brazil, to head off the last round of United Nations sanctions against Iran. After the United States brushed aside those negotiations, Turkey voted against the sanctions in the Security Council.
Mr. Gul said Turkey would adhere to the United Nations sanctions, but would not allow the measures to constrict its broader trade with Iran.
On Wednesday, Turkey's trade minister said in Istanbul that the American-led campaign to ban all banking transactions with Iran was a mistake. Turkish officials said it was up to Turkey's banks and companies to decide whether to go along with tougher unilateral sanctions decreed by the United States and the European Union.
''If the demand is for Turkey not to have any trade, any economic relations with Iran,'' Mr. Gul said, ''it would be unfair to Turkey.'' He claimed that some American and European companies continued to do business with Iran under new names, circumventing the sanctions. ''That is why the sanctions do not yield the results that are envisioned for them, in most cases,'' he said.
Administration officials and experts on sanctions said that as Dubai and other Persian Gulf emirates had begun to crack down on their banking links to Iran in response to the sanctions, Iran had sought other intermediaries that would give it access to the Western financial system. Turkey is an obvious channel, as is Qatar, these officials said.
''In a climate of financial restrictions and sanctions, Turks are actually increasing their trade with Iran,'' said Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former adviser to the Obama administration on Iran. ''It stems from their desire to be a pivotal power in the region.''
Treasury Department officials have visited Turkey to urge the government to put the sanctions into effect. The United States has also reminded Turkey of its obligations as a member of NATO.
A Treasury official said that what mattered more than Turkey's public stance was the response of Turkish banks and companies. He said many were worried that dealing with Iran could have repercussions on their business in the United States and Europe.
Mr. Gul insisted that Turkey did not want to see a nuclear-armed Iran. ''The perception here in the U.S. is that what Turkey is doing is in some way undermining U.S. policy,'' Mr. Gul said. ''That is definitely not the case.''
For now, Turkey's rift with Israel has hampered its role as a peacemaker in the Middle East. In 2008, Turkey mediated talks between Israel and Syria, but those ended after Israel's military strike on Gaza, which was harshly criticized by Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Mr. Gul, an academic who has served as foreign minister, has a less blunt public image than Mr. Erdogan, though both are viewed with concern by critics who fear Turkey is drifting toward a more militant Islamic focus.
After failing to meet Mr. Peres, Mr. Gul made time to see Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He also met Wednesday with representatives of Turkish and American companies at the Plaza Hotel.
Nothing seemed to make Mr. Gul prouder than Turkey's economy. Turkish bonds, he pointed out, were a safer investment than those of Portugal, Italy and Spain -- three members of a European Union that has not yet accepted Turkey. And Turkey did not have to bail out its banks. Mr. Gul recounted a meeting with a head of state this week, in which the leader told him, ''Turkey used to be known as the sick man of Europe, whereas Turkey now is the only healthy man of Europe.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Agenda To Take House Pushes Tax Cut

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans on Thursday will issue a legislative blueprint called ''A Pledge to America'' that they hope will catapult them to a majority in the November elections. Its goals include a permanent extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts, repeal of the newly enacted health care law, a cap on discretionary federal spending and an end to government control of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
With control of the House, the Republicans said they would seek to immediately cancel any unspent money from last year's $787 billion economic stimulus program, to freeze the size of the ''nonsecurity'' federal work force, and to quickly cut $100 billion in discretionary spending. But the blueprint, with echoes of the 1994 Contract With America, does not specify how the spending reductions would be carried out. 
While the agenda is drafted broadly, offering bullet points of overarching objectives rather than detailed proposals -- and any legislation championed by Republicans in the next Congress, of course, could be subject to a veto by President Obama -- the document represents the most concrete presentation of Republican goals so far this year. Aides said it was intended to show that the party was prepared to govern, and that in many cases legislation had already been drafted for many of the proposals in the plan, though specific bill numbers were not cited.
The blueprint was also clearly intended to provide fresh ideas to answer allegations by Mr. Obama and Democrats that Republicans simply want to return to the policies of the Bush administration. Still, many of the proposals represent classic Republican ideals of small government and low taxes pursued for generations by George W. Bush and other party leaders.
Among the specific policy points is a proposal to allow small businesses to take a new tax deduction equal to 20 percent of their income. Aides said the proposal was first put forward as part of the Republican alternative to the Democrats' economic stimulus plan, at a projected cost of $50 billion over 10 years.
While the document emphasizes a goal of long-term fiscal stability, including reductions in the deficit and a ''path to a balanced budget,'' it offers no specifics about changes to big entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicare, that would be required to achieve such stability.
In the document, to be officially unveiled at a news conference at a hardware store and lumberyard in Sterling, Va., House Republican leaders also seek to seize on the anger and frustration that many voters seem to feel about Washington these days.
''In a self-governing society, the only bulwark against the power of the state is the consent of the governed, and regarding the policies of the current government, the governed do not consent,'' the Republicans wrote in the introduction. ''An unchecked executive, a compliant legislature and an overreaching judiciary have combined to thwart the will of the people.''
Promising to ''honor the Constitution as constructed by its framers,'' the Republicans added: ''We pledge to advance policies that promote greater liberty, wider opportunity, a robust defense and national economic prosperity. We pledge to honor families, traditional marriage, life and the private and faith-based organizations that form the core of our American values.''
The introduction to the blueprint also stresses the need to improve the economy and create jobs. ''Rising joblessness, crushing debt and a polarizing political environment are fraying the bonds among our people,'' the Republicans wrote, adding a nod to states' rights.
''With this document,'' they wrote, ''we pledge to dedicate ourselves to the task of reconnecting our highest aspirations to the permanent truths of our founding by keeping faith with the values our nation was founded on, the principles we stand for, and the priorities of our people. This is our Pledge to America.''
Republicans will unveil the blueprint at the Tart Lumber Company, a family-owned business in Sterling, about 30 miles from the capital. Before the news conference, lawmakers will hold a round table with local small-business owners.
Aides said the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and other senior members of the Republican leadership would be present but would stay mostly in the background, allowing other lawmakers to lay out the agenda for reporters.
Anticipating the announcement, Democrats have assailed the Republican agenda in recent days.
''With this plan, they have made clear that they want to take America back to the same failed economic policies that caused this recession,'' the White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday evening.
He added, ''Their plan is also notable for what it doesn't talk about: protecting Social Security and Medicare from privatization schemes.''
A spokesman for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, also sharply criticized the G.O.P. agenda.
Democrats said they were interested in seeing how Republicans would vote on a bill to provide tax breaks and government-backed loans to small businesses that will be on the House floor when they return from making their announcement on Thursday afternoon.
Republicans said they did not want to wait until after the elections and would call on Ms. Pelosi to begin adopting aspects of their agenda right away.
The blueprint is divided into five chapters: a plan to create jobs and end economic uncertainty; a plan to stop out-of-control spending and reduce the size of government; a plan to repeal and replace the government takeover of health care; a plan to reform Congress and restore trust; and a plan to keep the nation secure at home and abroad.
To reform the legislative branch itself, the plan calls for cutting the budget of Congress, and for imposing new rules in the House, including requirements that all bills be posted on the Internet for three days before votes, and that all legislation include a clause ''citing the specific constitutional authority upon which the bill is justified.''
The final section, ''Checks and Balances,'' makes an argument for ending the Democrats' one-party control of Washington.
''We will stand committed to our principles and fight to renew the drive for a smaller, less costly and more accountable government,'' the Republicans wrote, adding, ''At the same time, we will serve as a check and a balance against any schemes that are inconsistent with the priorities and rights of the American people.''

HEADLINE: Facebook Founder to Donate $100 Million to Help Remake Newark's Schools

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive and a founder of Facebook, has agreed to donate $100 million to improve the long-troubled public schools in Newark, and Gov. Chris Christie will cede some control of the state-run system to Mayor Cory A. Booker in conjunction with the huge gift, officials said Wednesday.
The three men plan to announce the arrangement on Friday on the ''Oprah Winfrey Show.'' 
The changes would not formally relax the legal power the state seized in 1995, when it declared Newark's schools a failure and took control of the system, replacing the elected school board with a mostly toothless advisory board. Rather, Mr. Christie plans to give the mayor a major role in choosing a new superintendent and redesigning the system, but to retain the right to take control back.
For now, at least, the arrangement tightens an already friendly relationship between the governor, a Republican, and the mayor, a Democrat who was once seen as a likely challenger for the State House in 2013. It also promises to be a rare happy moment in a state troubled by budget crises, scandals, political infighting and, most recently, the loss of a $400 million federal education grant because of a clerical error.
Mr. Zuckerberg, 26, who grew up in Westchester County and now lives in California, has no particular connection to Newark. But in July, he and Mr. Booker met at a conference and began a continuing conversation about the mayor's plans for the city, according to people familiar with their relationship.
Mr. Booker, an advocate of school choice, has been traveling the country, meeting business leaders and celebrities, proselytizing and raising money for Newark. Ms. Winfrey has been one of his biggest supporters, and has given millions of dollars to schools and other organizations in Newark over the last few years.
The $100 million for Newark is the initial gift to start a foundation for education financed by Mr. Zuckerberg. This would be by far the largest publicly known gift by Mr. Zuckerberg, whose fortune Forbes magazine estimated last year at $2 billion.
Mr. Booker, Mr. Christie and Mr. Zuckerberg all declined to be interviewed on Wednesday. The officials who spoke about the plan did so on the condition of anonymity because it was two days before the scheduled announcement.
The gift is many times larger than any the system has received, officials said -- an extraordinary sum not only for a district with an $800 million annual operating budget, but also for any publicly financed government agency. It is not yet clear how the money would be used, or over what period.
Despite 15 years of state control, the Newark schools have test scores and graduation rates that are among the lowest in New Jersey.
Mr. Christie has said that he generally does not approve of state takeovers of local agencies, and he supported the elimination of state oversight of Camden early this year. But he had given no sign of backing away from control of the schools in Newark.
Less than a month ago, the governor informed the city's schools superintendent, Clifford B. Janey, that he would not be rehired, and that the state was looking for a successor. There has been speculation in Trenton about the possibility of hiring Michelle A. Rhee, the hard-charging schools chief in Washington, whose political patron, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, recently lost his bid for re-election.
Officials said Mr. Christie planned to announce that he and Mr. Booker would jointly select a new superintendent, a decision the governor has the power to make on his own. And they said he would instruct the mayor to come up with a reform plan for the system: in effect, asking Mr. Booker to redesign it.
''We can't speculate too much at this point about what the specifics would be,'' a person briefed on the plans said.
But on issues like expansion of charter schools, rigorous testing and rewarding teachers and administrators whose students succeed, this person said, ''their vision is very much in step.''
Under Mr. Christie, the state has rewarded schools that made aggressive changes, like awarding grants to a group of Newark high schools that replaced half their staffs.
The announcements could win points for Mr. Christie with local officials and school advocates who have chafed under state control, and take away some of the sting of his cuts to state aid for schools. It also ties him more closely to a popular Democrat in a state that usually favors Democrats. But the move could damage his alliance with the mayor if, in the end, their visions do not match.
It also puts Mr. Booker in a situation not occupied by his predecessors, who had little overt influence over the schools. The mayor has said many times that he wants the state to cede control, but critics have charged that he did little to make that happen. If his reform plan fails to transform the system, it could deal a blow to his reputation.

HEADLINE: 10 Years After the Prom: Friends as Landmarks

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
''Mine is the generation of unfulfilled expectations,'' is how Joyce Maynard described herself in a 1972 article in The New York Times Magazine that served as a manifesto of baby-boomer apathy and self-absorption. ''My generation is special because of what we missed rather than what we got.''
A high school senior graduating in 2010 could pretty much say the same thing, which is the problem with generational generalizations. Momentous turning points like the Vietnam War or the Kennedy assassination or the Beatles, which seem uniquely formative, turn out to be not so different from the pivotal crises and triumphs that shaped epochs past, present and future. 
''My Generation,'' an appealing new series on ABC on Thursday, is proof of that -- the peer group is not nearly as distinctive as the individuals within it.
The drama catches up with nine high school classmates from Austin, Tex., 10 years after their graduation. Back then it was 2000, and the world seemed safe and the economy invulnerable. Flashbacks to what the seniors predicted about their future are etched with irony. ''I think George Bush is going to be the best president this country has ever seen,'' is what Rolly (Mehcad Brooks) the class jock, says proudly. Ten years later Rolly is a sergeant serving in Afghanistan and carrying pictures of his pregnant wife back home.
The show is framed as a documentary in the style of Michael Apted's ''Up'' film series, which began in 1964 as an expose of the British class system but ended up as a real-life roman-fleuve -- the 14 children in the film grew up and led lives far richer and less predictable than their social status would suggest. Similarly, ''My Generation'' is better as a coming-of-age saga than as a mock longitudinal study of Texans rattled by Sept. 11, Enron, Katrina and the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.
A person's path doesn't necessarily follow the national mood, and character is more likely formed in the playpen than at a summer internship. Yet there are some piquant links between the characters' fates and the nation's.
Two friends fall out in the wake of Enron. The class beauty gave up on show business after a disappointing stint on a reality show. At graduation Brenda (Daniella Alonso), the class brain, was hellbent on becoming a scientist but tells the unseen documentary filmmaker that she switched to law and politics because of the 2000 Supreme Court decision in Bush v. Gore.
But, of course, Brenda is a single workaholic on Capitol Hill not because of a presidential election but because she never got over her first love. And it wasn't Enron or the Iraq war that caused the breakup; it was her boyfriend's snobbish parents, and that reflects Victorian values, not the new millennium.
The mockumentary conceit has been done to death, especially in sitcoms inspired by ''Arrested Development'' and ''The Office.'' But it's effective in this drama, lending the characters' monologues both poignancy and also a light layer of satire. When characters confide their innermost thoughts to an unseen interviewer, those streams of self-consciousness reveal sadness -- and also some of their more absurd delusions.
Despite its title, ''My Generation'' isn't really about growing up in the shadow of the last decade's cataclysms. It's a look at nine people through the prism of their high school aspirations, and oddly enough, that makes it all the more universal.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lauds Russia on Barring Arms to Iran, as Obama Speaks to U.N.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ANDREW E. KRAMER; David E Sanger reported from the United Nations, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow. Mark Landler contributed reporting from the United Nations.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The White House praised Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, on Wednesday for publicly barring the shipment of an advanced antimissile system to Iran, even as American diplomats here discussed a plan to reopen negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The Russian announcement and the effort to revive a diplomatic engagement that fell apart a year ago came as President Obama arrived in New York for the opening of the United NationsGeneral Assembly and laid out what he called an ambitious new approach to American development assistance for the world's poorest countries.
''The days when your development was dictated by foreign capitals must come to an end,'' Mr. Obama said from the well of the United Nations, the first of two speeches there over two days, drawing applause from nearly 190 nations attending the Millennium Development Goals summit meeting.
Mr. Medvedev's announcement confirmed in public what Russian officials had quietly told American and French officials in June: that he would interpret the United Nations sanctions against Iran as mandating that Russia should permanently halt delivery of S-300 missiles, which Tehran wanted to build as a deterrent to airstrikes against its nuclear facilities. The declaration by Mr. Medvedev ended equivocation by Russian officials about whether the sophisticated advanced air defense system would fall under the sanctions ban. 
Iran declared several months ago that it would build an equivalent system of its own, but obtaining the components, the guidance systems and the expertise would be a challenge, especially with the ban on high-technology imports to the country.
The White House, eager to demonstrate cooperation with Russia at a moment when the Senate is debating ratification of the new strategic arms reduction treaty, said in a statement that Mr. Medvedev ''has demonstrated leadership on holding Iran accountable to its international obligations from start to finish.'' It added, ''This continues to demonstrate how Russia and the United States are cooperating closely on behalf of our mutual interests, and global security.''
Mr. Medvedev's decree ended an internal debate in Russia, pitting supporters of sanctions against those trying to bolster economic relations with Iran, and about whether the Security Council sanctions included the air defense missiles. Russian news media had reported that the contract was worth $800 million.
''The importance is, it is now public and official,'' James F. Collins, former ambassador to Russia and a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
The Russian and American announcements came as Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, continued a seemingly endless series of public appearances in New York: television interviews, meetings with reporters and academics and speeches denouncing American imperialism, proclaiming the failures of capitalism, and warning the United States that it had never been involved in a ''real war.''
But he also said that the resumption of talks between Iran and the West was inevitable, and while the United States fears being mired in fruitless negotiations while Iran's stockpile of nuclear material increases, Mr. Ahmadinejad's prediction seems about right.
At a meeting today with France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China, diplomats planned what one senior American official described to reporters as a ''phased approach'' that would include reviving an earlier proposal to supply Iran with enriched fuel for a research reactor in Tehran in return for Iran's shipping the bulk of its stockpile of uranium to Russia and France.
''We're prepared to engage and see if we can't produce what would be a confidence-building step,'' said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing a private meeting.
The original deal fell apart soon after it was negotiated last October in Geneva, rejected in Tehran. That set off a chain of events that led to the Security Council sanctions, the toughest of four passed in as many years.
Part of the motivation for the sanctions was to force Iran back to negotiations, and ultimately to comply with the Security Council demand that it halt all enrichment of nuclear fuel and answer the questions posed by international inspectors. But resurrecting the research reactor deal will be tricky.
The original deal called for Iran to turn over 1,200 kilograms of nuclear fuel, in return for specialized fuel rods that would enable the research reactor to produce medical isotopes. At the time, that would have left Iran with less than one bomb's worth of low-enriched uranium. But since then, Iran's stockpile has increased, and it has begun enriching some uranium to 20 percent, a level of purity that takes it closer to bomb-grade fuel.
A new deal would call for Iran to turn over more of its stockpile, and to cease the 20 percent enrichment.
Communicating with Iran has been characteristically difficult. Iran has yet to respond to specific overtures by the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs, Catherine Ashton. She is seeking a specific date for a meeting.
Iran's reluctance to do that may reflect internal disagreements in Tehran about how to respond to the latest Western efforts to discuss its nuclear program, another senior official said.
The administration hopes to learn more about Iran's intentions later this week when the British foreign secretary, William Hague, meets the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, in New York. Iranian officials are also likely to meet diplomats from Russia and China.
But in a sign of the chill between the United States and Iran, officials said they did not expect any meetings, even impromptu encounters, between American and Iranian officials in New York. Just the process of arranging a meeting with Iran will take several weeks, an official said.
Mr. Obama used the United Nations development conference to announce a plan to reinvigorate American development efforts and the principal agency for delivering them, the United States Agency for International Development, which languished for years with financing cutbacks and a loss of talented employees.
Instead of dictating development projects and goals to poorer countries, he said, the United States would seek partnerships with local governments and organizations to give them a voice in setting their priorities. He also said the administration would focus on choosing development projects where it believed that American involvement could produce sustainable economic growth. It will also seek to team up with other governments and well-financed new players, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
While the administration does not plan to change its overall commitment to aid, officials said it would reallocate funds from countries that are deemed less promising to those with a greater chance of success.
The White House wants to raise the profile of the development agency, but it has not fundamentally changed its place in the administration. The agency's administrator, Rajiv Shah, will continue to report to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. In a largely symbolic step, he will have a seat on the National Security Council for issues that are relevant to development.

HEADLINE: Feeling Slighted by France, And Respected by the U.S.

BYLINE: By SCOTT SAYARE

 BODY:
BONDY, France -- The residents of this poor, multiracial Paris suburb say they have been abandoned. For 30 years, they say, the French authorities have written off Bondy and neighborhoods like it, treating their inhabitants as terminal delinquents and ignoring their potential.
This, residents note, is not the approach taken by the United States Department of State.
''We're waiting for the president of the Republic, for his ministers,'' said Gilbert Roger, the mayor of Bondy. ''And we see the ambassador of the United States.''
The United States Embassy in Paris has formed a network of partnerships with local governments, advocacy groups, entrepreneurs, students and cultural leaders in the troubled immigrant enclaves outside France's major cities. 
Begun in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks as part of an effort to bolster the image of the United States within Muslim communities across the globe, American outreach in these hard neighborhoods -- often referred to collectively as the ''banlieues,'' or suburbs -- has grown in scale and visibility since the election of Barack Obama.
France is home to five million to six million Muslims, Europe's largest Muslim population, and the banlieues have long been considered potential incubators for religious extremism. But anti-American sentiment, once pervasive in these neighborhoods, seems to have been all but erased since the election of Mr. Obama, who has proved to be a powerful symbol of hope here and a powerful diplomatic tool.
Many suggest the Americans' warm reception is a measure of these communities' sense of abandonment. Others say it is the presence of Mr. Obama in the White House. Whatever the case, the United States is now more popular in the banlieues than at any other time in recent memory, say French and American officials.
Much of the embassy's outreach is meant to dispel ''mistruths'' about the United States, the ambassador, Charles H. Rivkin, said in an interview, adding, ''It's easier to hate something you don't understand.''
With an annual public affairs budget of about $3 million, the Paris embassy has sponsored urban renewal projects, music festivals and conferences. Since Mr. Obama's election, the Americans have helped organize seminars for minority politicians, coaching them in electoral strategy, fund-raising and communications.
The International Visitor Leadership Program, which sends 20 to 30 promising French entrepreneurs and politicians to America for several weeks each year, now includes more minority participants, and Muslims in particular. The embassy began a similar program for French teenagers.
Mr. Rivkin, 48, an entertainment executive and the youngest American ambassador to France in nearly 60 years, has taken a strong personal interest in the banlieues. Earlier this year, he thrilled a group of students in Bondy when he arrived with the actor Samuel L. Jackson, one of several entertainment industry contacts he has called upon in France. In Los Angeles, Mr. Rivkin cultivated ties between the family media and hip-hop worlds; in Paris, he has hosted local rappers at the Hotel Rothschild, his official residence.
Officials insist the outreach is not meant solely to curry favor for the United States; the Americans also see an emerging group of political and business elites in these neighborhoods. The embassy is ''trying to connect with the next generation of leaders in France,'' Mr. Rivkin said. ''That includes the banlieues.''
Few French leaders speak in such hopeful terms.
Residents ''have the sense that the United States looks upon our areas with much more deference and respect,'' said Mr. Roger, the Bondy mayor. For electoral reasons, he said, French politicians exaggerate the violence and criminality here.
Ministerial excursions to the banlieues often entail a crushing police presence and vows to crack down on crime. President Nicolas Sarkozy, who as interior minister famously pledged to clean up one of these cities with a ''Karcher'' -- a brand of high-pressure hose -- typically spends his time here consulting with law enforcement officials.
Though often criticized as not serious about stemming the violence, poverty and unemployment that plague the banlieues, the French government commits $5 billion annually to these cities, according to Fadela Amara, the secretary of state for urban policy. Since 2003, she said, the state has pledged more than $16 billion to a nationwide urban reconstruction program.
Residents and local politicians say this is nowhere near enough, though they add that money alone will not solve the problems.
''Do you know what it means to give recognition in the suburbs?'' asked Aziz Senni, 34, the founder of a taxi service and an investment fund dedicated to spurring economic development in the banlieues, where he was raised. ''It's worth as much as gold.''
A Moroccan-born Muslim, Mr. Senni traveled to the United States in 2006 as a participant in the visitor program. He was effusive in his praise for the outreach and the optimism it has spread. ''Never has France had this type of approach,'' he said.
Mr. Senni spoke of feeling ''stigmatized'' by French leaders. A law banning the full facial veil, a government-led ''debate on national identity'' and a recent proposal to revoke French nationality from certain criminals ''of foreign origin'' have been widely felt as attacks on immigrants and Muslims here.
''The emerging elite in the suburbs doesn't see itself in the way it's being treated by French society,'' said Nordine Nabili, 43, who directs the new Bondy branch of a journalism school, E.Lille; he hosted Mr. Rivkin and Mr. Jackson there in April.
''You're the future,'' Mr. Jackson told the students.
Mr. Nabili said, ''I don't think people tell them that enough.'' But he worries that the Americans may be raising hopes too high. Beyond good feelings, he said, ''there really needs to be a true policy.''
Mr. Rivkin called such concerns unfounded. ''From my vantage point, this embassy has not been peddling false dreams,'' he said. ''Anything is possible, if you put your mind to it and work hard enough.''
Widad Ketfi, 25, was among the students who met Mr. Rivkin and Mr. Jackson earlier this year. ''We won't be disappointed,'' she insisted. The American attention is proof that ''these young people are succeeding,'' and that ''we're not invisible,'' she said.
A Muslim born to French-Algerian parents, she acknowledged the likelihood that the Americans had reached out to her, at least in part, because of her background.
Asked if that reality left her uneasy, Ms. Ketfi replied, ''What bothers me is being the target of the French state.''

HEADLINE: Preserving the Dewiness of Youth

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

 BODY:
IN the last decade, the dermatologist Dr. Nicholas Perricone has become an outspoken platoon leader in the battle against aging. Mostly, his troops of true believers were the wrinkled middle-aged. They bought into his theory that inflammation causes aging, and that eating wild salmon and blueberries would make their skin glow anew.
Dr. Perricone, from Meriden, Conn., has spent time and capital establishing his Perricone MD brand among these consumers as a serious cosmeceutical contender. In numerous books, including ''The Wrinkle Cure''; on his PBS specials; and on his blog the Daily Perricone, he extols a ''three-tiered'' way to get radiant skin: an anti-inflammatory diet, his nutritional supplements and his expensive potions. The RX3 Repair Kit, which includes six dark-brown bottles with an apothecary feel, is $482.40 at a reduced price on Perriconemd.com. (Otherwise, the set is $603.) 
Making its nationwide debut in October at Sephora, his new topical skin-care line, Super (which contains antioxidant-rich ''superfoods''), is anything but somber. The dozen products, priced from $20 to $50, are packaged in cheery colors offset by white, with whimsical copy. Supermodel Legs, a cream with chili pepper, is meant to be applied whenever ''you need runway-ready legs,'' the box says. A melon-infused unguent called Bright Eyed claims to give users ''wide-awake peepers that look perfectly perky and impossibly fresh.''
Is Dr. Perricone, a 62-year-old prone to pontification, trying to have fun? ''Not a lot of brands talk to a 28-year-old,'' said Daniel Giles, the senior vice president for marketing at Perricone. ''That's where Super is positioned, to 25- to 30-year-olds.''
He added, ''It's a happy, friendly way of approaching skin care.''
A Super store in Berkeley, Calif., which opened in July, has the slogan ''Feed Hungry Skin'' in fuchsia on a wall; its products, including a watercress toner, almost resemble iPods. Staff members offer quickie treatments like the ''Big O,'' a micro-current facial that ''hits all the right spots'' -- quite a contrast to the staid, clinical-seeming Perricone MD flagship store on Madison Avenue.
Pinpointing such a narrow demographic is ''unusual and innovative'' for a brand, said Stephan Kanlian, the chairman of the master's program in cosmetics marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''Normally the target is much broader, in order to make it more economically feasible.''
New York-based apothecary lines like Kiehl's and Malin+Goetz have been well received, he pointed out. But, he said, ''we're waiting for a niche lifestyle brand in skin care to come along and catch fire,'' especially one with a nutritional component.
In the past, Perricone acolytes listened to the doctor's orders because of their crow's feet or smile lines. But how will dewy-skinned 20-somethings respond to his anti-aging message? Five women invited to The Times to sample Super liked it, but cost was a concern. Only one, Rebecca Wiegand, a dating blogger from Brooklyn, said she'd actually buy it. ''I was thinking about the SATs in the ninth grade,'' Ms. Wiegand said. ''So it only makes sense I am thinking about wrinkles at 27.''
Another, Andrea Lavinthal, an author of the book ''Your So-Called Life,'' for women on the edge of 30, does believe she must act now if she wants her face and decolletage to look good in a decade. ''Thirty is not baby-faced,'' said Ms. Lavinthal, a beauty editor at realbeauty.com. ''I feel like I'm on a landslide to 40. If I want to look like Julia Roberts in 'Eat Pray Love,' either I need to get a lighting crew or skin-care products.''
Both women's concerns jibe with what Jody Crane, a marketing consultant, has found in her research into the skin concerns of women age 25 to 30. They say to themselves, ''I want to be beautiful, desirable, sexy and looking around me, 'Oh, my gosh, if I have any little wrinkles, or lines, or anything, I'm out of the ballgame,' so even if I don't see lines on my face now, I'm petrified I'm going to get them tomorrow,'' said Ms. Crane, the president of New Solutions Marketing.
But she suspects there are limits to the appeal of Dr. Perricone's program. ''The three-tiered thing, I can't imagine a 25-year-old doing that,'' she said. (And leaving aside the $50 price for Super's ginger facial, Ms. Wiegand said in all seriousness: ''A three-minute facial? I don't have time for that.'')
Dr. Ellen Marmur, the chief of the division of dermatologic and cosmetic surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center, agrees with Dr. Perricone that some types of inflammation contribute to signs of aging, and sees merit in eating well and using soothing products. But she cautioned it's not clear what amount of, say, melon extract in an eye cream is effective: ''The billion-dollar question that the entire cosmetic industry is built on is the fact no one knows how much of these ingredients are necessary to make a difference on your skin.''
Kat Fay, a senior analyst at Mintel who writes an annual skin-care report, thinks Super is part of a trend of getting women involved earlier in the fight against aging. ''They are trying to hit them up with the prophylactic angle,'' she said. ''You look dewy and sweet now, but what about 10 years from now? Your life is over!''
At the St. Regis recently, Dr. Perricone defended his grab for a younger demographic. ''Vanity is a great motivator,'' he said between sips of jasmine green tea with cinnamon (a ''superfood'' he adores). While it's one thing to say ''eat this way and reduce your cancer risk,'' he said, it's far more stirring to say, ''you'll look younger and more glamorous within three days.''
Dr. Perricone's complexion had the gleam of a man a decade his junior. He said he never ventures to downtown Manhattan, but a Super store may end up in the nightclub-heavy meatpacking district next year. (San Francisco and Chicago are other contenders.)
When he was still practicing as a dermatologist, he said, he had patients age 27 to 30 complaining, ''I got old overnight.'' He explained this as an accumulation of microscopic scars to the dermis. ''I call it the birth of a wrinkle,'' he said.
Correction: October 7, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, the Skin Deep column on Sept. 23, about skin-care products aimed at younger women, misspelled the name of a company that makes such products. It is Kiehl's, not Keihl's.

Re ''Frustration and Fear Greet Obama in Town Hall Chat'' (Business Day, Sept. 21):
Like many of my fellow liberals, I am disappointed with the pace of change during the Obama administration.
But I believe that the blame lies much less with President Obama than it does with the United States Senate, specifically its rule that permits important measures to be filibustered to death unless 60 or more senators are willing to vote to end debate. 
The Republican Party of ''no'' has abused this rule at a record-breaking pace to kill important legislation or water it down. If the Senate were run by majority rule, like the House, Congress would have probably passed a larger stimulus bill, stronger reform of the financial industry and more comprehensive health care reform. We might even have bills to reduce global warming and to permit gays to serve openly in the military.
Ironically, Republicans now appear poised to benefit from their obstructionism in the November elections. The Senate will remain dysfunctional as long as its rules permit a minority of senators to thwart the will of the majority. Worse, our country will continue to suffer.

To the Editor:
So many complaints to, and about, our president! I think the worst thing he did was to win the election so easily; now, everyone expects him to be a miracle worker.
Miracle workers don't exist. He tried to tell us that.
He said: Some of these problems may take three, maybe four years to solve.
He said: Things may get worse before they get better.
He said: I can't do it alone. I need you.
We applauded his honesty, then ignored it. That, friends, is our fault.

Re ''Tea, Anyone? Republicans: Enlist, but Avoid Talking About the Constitution'' (Week in Review, Sept. 19):
It is a sad commentary on the state of our democracy that so few Americans seem to know about the more controversial positions of Tea Party supporters. In the past few months, I have read reports of Tea Partiers' desire to repeal the 17th Amendment (election of senators by popular vote) and do away with the Department of Education.
A healthy democracy requires an informed electorate. Unfortunately, the cynical Tea Party is relying on voter ignorance to carry the day. The only hope is that Americans will pay attention before it's too late.

With the upset victories of the Tea Party candidates Joe Miller in Alaska, Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Carl P. Paladino in New York, both Democrats and Republicans are confused as to what it all means.
Democrats perceive the Tea Party victories as a light in a dark tunnel, still unclear whether it's a glimmer of hope or an oncoming train. The Republicans are equally nervous because some of the candidates have questionable backgrounds.
The political establishment in both parties forgets that the average American believes that powerful government benefits the powerful. Americans are fed up with government encroachment on their rights, new mandates and taxes.
Tea Party activists realize that their taxes pay for politicians' excessive spending projects and benefit the politically well connected. Many politicians are too focused on what these recent primaries mean to their position in the coming election and miss the most powerful point: Americans are upset with how politicians are running up huge deficits with borrowed money.
Charlie Madden Dover, Mass., Sept. 19, 2010
To the Editor:
I am delighted to see the reaction of your editors, Op-Ed pundits and liberal readers to the surge of conservatism across America, even in the Northeast.
The struggle between conservatives and moderates/liberals in the Republican Party has been going on for decades. From Senator Robert A. Taft to Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan and beyond, the conservative movement surged and ebbed until you thought, in 2008, that you had extinguished this ''unenlightened'' thinking.
Previously a relative minority of us were firm believers in small government and adherence to the Constitution. Suddenly, vast numbers of formerly unaligned, uninvolved voters have come alive to actively oppose the socialization of America, galvanized into action by a far-left, mysterious president, in league with big-spending leadership (Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid).
Please continue to underestimate and denigrate those whom you neither understand nor believe can be ''real.'' We are ''real'' Americans, and we will prevail.
Marilyn Gould Wilton, Conn., Sept. 21, 2010
To the Editor:
Over the last several months, the Tea Party rage has dominated the news. A relatively small group of ultraconservative Americans has driven our political discourse. It's time for a fresh perspective.
I am an ardent liberal, and I am also angry. I'm angry that gay and lesbian members of the military fighting for our democracy continue to be forced to lie about their sexuality.
I'm angry that the proposed end to the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy has Republicans up in arms, even though it would reduce our deficit (their favorite battle cry).
I'm angry that our education, transportation and economic systems are failing most Americans, and yet instead of addressing those issues, Republicans continue to run on ''family values'' platforms.
Well, I believe in values, too. I believe in opportunity for all, including those with little voice. I believe in the right to a free quality education, a right to be able to work and a right to fair treatment within our financial system.
This is a time for our nation to grow and to make changes that will propel us forward with grace and promise.

HEADLINE: The Undervalued Chinese Currency

BYLINE: By IAN CAMPBELL and JEFFREY GOLDFARB

 BODY:
Tensions over the cheap renminbi are running high amid Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's visit to New York. Japan's deliberate weakening of the yen further aggravates China. The irony is that America, too, might be said to be pursuing a weak currency policy. And there are other, quieter, victims in the currency wars.
Currency strains are proliferating because global growth is scarce. The United States is not recovering fast. Many American businesses and politicians accuse China of taking away American jobs. A Congressional committee may vote for trade sanctions on China on Friday. Quarrels could get nasty and lead to reprisals. 
American critics of China have a case. The country's trade deficit with China was $25.9 billion in July, more than half the total. China froze its exchange rate in 2008 to be a global Wal-Mart: a cheap shop when world spending was tight. Only in recent weeks has it allowed a little renminbi appreciation.
China, too, has pressing priorities. Mr. Wen warns that a 20 to 40 percent appreciation of the renminbi, as American lobbyists want, could close Chinese companies, send rural workers back to their homes and threaten ''major turbulence in Chinese society.''
As the two major players tussle, others are getting hurt. The Federal Reserve's intimation of more money-printing this week has driven the dollar down. The currency is cheap in yen. And the euro, at $1.33, is priced high, making exports expensive. Yet Europe, too, needs growth -- desperately so in its uncompetitive periphery economies. And other Asian currencies like the Malaysian ringgit have been strengthening against both the dollar and the renminbi.
Global compromise is needed. China should allow the renminbi to appreciate more. Doing so would help balance China's growth. But the United States must be patient about the rate at which this happens. For the dollar, too, is cheap. And the big trade deficit cannot be blamed entirely on a cheap renminbi. Euros and yen aren't cheap, but Americans keep buying more European and Japanese cars.
The Fate of Basel
American banks and regulators have a poor track record when it comes to adopting global capital standards. The United States was a major driver behind the Basel II accord, signed in 2004, but then barely enforced the rules. That is why many Europeans are right to be wondering whether the tough new framework known as Basel III, agreed to by global regulators this month, will again be deemed optional on the other side of the Atlantic.
Senior American officials are making the right noises. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said this week that the United States was ''committed to meeting'' the end-2012 fulfillment timeframe. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair, is even more optimistic. She told Reuters the American delegation had wanted a quicker transition and reckons plenty of American banks will do it faster on their own anyway.
The confidence is welcome but hard to reconcile with reality. For one, the same bullish rhetoric accompanied the Basel II agreements. True, the United States was far more relaxed about risk before the crisis. And while Basel II would have allowed some banks to operate with even less capital, the new agreement should make the industry much safer. But the crisis is fading from memory as credit write-downs and corporate defaults wither.
Many of the same pitfalls that befell Basel II in the United States still lie in wait. As Europe pressed ahead, American Congressional and regulatory authorities haggled over which banks should adopt the standards, the use of internal models to measure risk and the potential problem of inconsistent application of the rules globally. Some of these arguments were valid, and it's easy to see similar disagreements arising again.
What's more, even though today's American regulatory regime might be stronger, with the Federal Reserve as a newly powerful linchpin, it remains a complex web. And these fragmented agencies are already coping with more than 2,000 pages of financial reform.
It's possible the United States might move the new capital rules to the front of the queue and finally become a global leader on the issue. But since it failed to do so last time, the rest of the world understandably won't want the shame of being fooled twice.

HEADLINE: After Years of Failure, A New Day for Temple

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- In his office at Temple University, Coach Al Golden keeps an air mattress inflated for the nights when he cannot make it home while orchestrating one of college football's most remarkable turnarounds. Earlier this week, with Penn State looming, he did not even take a moment to make the bed.
The long-forlorn Owls (3-0) have won 12 of their last 14 games, a stunning reversal considering that Temple lost its membership in the Big East Conference in 2004 because of spectator and competitive indifference and came within one vote of discontinuing major college football five years ago.
A victory Saturday at 23rd-ranked Penn State -- Golden's alma mater -- would provide a defining moment and very likely a national ranking for Temple, which has not defeated the Nittany Lions (2-1) since 1941, two months before the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
More broadly, a victory would accelerate the urgency of answering this question: What should the proper role of football be at an urban university that lacks the championship legacy of other metropolitan schools like Southern California, Miami and Pittsburgh?
Temple has no stadium on campus, hemorrhages at least $2.5 million a year in red ink on an $8 million football budget, plays in the geographically awkward Mid-American Conference, struggles for visibility and fan support in a city consumed by its professional teams and sits on 115 acres in a frayed north Philadelphia neighborhood.
While piping in crowd noise at practice to simulate the 107,000 fans expected at Penn State, Golden jokingly noted that his team was also relying on the ambient sounds of subway cars, buses and ''police cars going through.''
Yet Temple's football revival has coincided with an ambitious plan to transform Philadelphia's major public university and to revitalize the surrounding neighborhood. Once primarily a commuter school, Temple now has 11,000 of its 37,000 students living on or near campus. New art and business schools have been built as parts of a $1.2 billion construction and renovation program planned over the next decade.
A sense of community finally exists on campus, and a successful football team can help build pride and promote the university's brand, officials said. The as-yet-unanswered question is, exactly what sort of football program is it possible and reasonable to build and sustain?
''We can be as good as we want to be,'' said Bill Bradshaw, Temple's athletic director. ''How good do we want to be? What are we willing to commit to be that?''
The Owls played in the inaugural Sugar Bowl game in 1935. But they have spent nearly three decades living down the wildly overreaching prediction, made in 1982 by a former university president, that Temple would soon return to such postseason regard.
Instead, the Owls have produced only three winning seasons since 1979. Being forced out of the Big East was a huge blow to Temple's esteem. University officials even considered eliminating football in 2005, or dropping to what was formerly known as Division I-AA.
Only by a vote of 8 to 7, with one abstention, did a university panel decide to keep football at the major college level, Bradshaw said. Even the university president at the time was said to have voted no. And those who voted yes were acting ''on hope with no evidence,'' Bradshaw said.
The eventual recovery was spurred by three actions: Temple signed a long-term agreement to play at 68,500-seat Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles. Desperate and thankful, the Owls joined the Mid-American Conference for football, even though their nearest opponent was hundreds of miles away. And in December 2005, Temple hired Golden, who at 36 was then the second-youngest head coach at the major college level.
Now 41, Golden has the hulking presence of a former Penn State tight end and a compelling speaking style drawn from corporate leadership books. He talks about taking his players from ''directing to empowerment'' and avoiding the ''doom loop'' of initial success relapsing into habitual failure.
Through the force of his personality, upgraded practice and weight room facilities, more rigorous academic demands and indefatigable recruiting of better athletes, Golden has set about rebuilding Temple football brick by brick. While the Owls lack the amenities of Penn State and other powers, he is quick to note that John Wooden began his U.C.L.A. basketball dynasty sharing practice space with the gymnastics team.
''Really, it comes down to two acres and a ball,'' Golden said.
Out of necessity, a certain modesty has attended Temple's revival. The Owls' recruiting area runs from New England to the Chesapeake Bay. Coaches travel by car and must get permission to fly. During the last recruiting cycle, Golden said he spent one night in a hotel in five weeks. Nonconference road games are also scheduled within driving distance so that fans can easily attend.
Last season the Owls finished 9-4, building their first winning season since 1990 and receiving their first bowl invitation since 1979. This season running back Bernard Pierce is being promoted as a Heisman Trophy contender.
''Coach has made us believe that we can be winners,'' said quarterback Chester Stewart, a redshirt junior who came to Temple from DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Md. ''At first, we couldn't go through tough conditioning drills. Or some guys would skip meetings or violate team rules. Now everybody is buying into it.''
Increased success has brought increased ambition. Temple is upgrading its schedule, extending its contract with Penn State; adding Connecticut, Rutgers and Maryland; and seeking a three-year arrangement with Notre Dame that would begin in 2013.
At an uncertain time in college athletics, when conference affiliations have become a game of musical chairs, Temple can offer a foothold in the nation's fourth-largest media market and sixth largest city.
If it remains in the MAC, Temple will aspire to be a national power outside of the Bowl Championship Series like Boise State or Texas Christian, Golden and Bradshaw said.
The Big East is also said to have renewed interest in Temple football if Villanova declines an invitation to jump to the major college level, which would give the Owls more proximate and engaging conference opponents and more bountiful access to bowl revenue.
''If we keep working hard and filling seats and raise money and become very good, there's a lot of opportunity, in my opinion,'' Bradshaw said.
Of course, increased aspirations bring escalating costs in an arms race that even the N.C.A.A. says is unsustainable. In football, that means everything from indoor practice facilities to inflated salaries for coaches. Golden's yearly compensation of between $700,000 and $800,000 does not compare with the $4 million that Nick Saban makes at top-ranked Alabama and is below what some powers pay their women's basketball coaches.
On Golden's wish list is a campus stadium that would seat 35,000 to 40,000, bolster campus spirit and draw from 125,000 alumni in the area. ''It's going to bring people together,'' Golden said. ''If they don't convene and go to games when they're students, they're not going to convene and go to games when they're alums.''
A stadium is a tough sell in difficult economic times, especially since Temple's contract with Lincoln Financial Field runs through 2017 and the university has hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for other campus projects. Bradshaw said the stadium idea was not a ''50-50'' proposition, but was also ''not out of the question.''
Candidly, Golden said that additional resources, not simply determination and hard work, would be necessary to build Temple into a maintainable power. (Dick Vermeil, who coached the Eagles to the Super Bowl after the 1980 season and resigned from burnout in 1982, saw the bed in Golden's office and admonished Bradshaw, ''Don't let what happened to me happen to him.'')
Eventually, Temple will have to confront Golden's inevitable departure. After last season, he interviewed at Tennessee and Notre Dame. The hope, Bradshaw said, is that Golden will build a sustainable model and ''will hand off a program, not just a feel-good story.''
Until then, he said, Temple should just enjoy the ride.
''All this is new for Temple people -- someone else wanting our coach, teaching our students not to yell when we're on offense, having them go to games expecting to win,'' Bradshaw said. ''We used to sell hot dogs to go at halftime.''

HEADLINE: Offended Muslims Speak Up

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
At a time of growing tensions involving Muslims in the United States, a record number of Muslim workers are complaining of employment discrimination, from co-workers calling them ''terrorist'' or ''Osama'' to employers barring them from wearing head scarves or taking prayer breaks.
Such complaints were increasing even before frictions erupted over the planned Islamic center in Lower Manhattan, with Muslim workers filing a record 803 such claims in the year ended Sept. 30, 2009. That was up 20 percent from the previous year and up nearly 60 percent from 2005, according to federal data.
The number of complaints filed since then will not be announced until January, but Islamic groups say they have received a surge in complaints recently, suggesting that 2010's figure will set another record. 
The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has found enough merit in some of the complaints that it has filed several prominent lawsuits on behalf of Muslim workers.
Last month, the commission sued JBS Swift, a meatpacking company, on behalf of 160 Somali immigrants, saying supervisors and workers had cursed them for being Muslim; thrown blood, meat and bones at them; and interrupted their prayer breaks.
On Sept. 1, the commission filed a case against Abercrombie & Fitch, the fashionable clothing retailer, accusing it of discrimination for refusing to hire an 18-year-old Muslim because she was wearing a head scarf.
And in June, the agency sued a Four Points by Sheraton hotel in Phoenix, asserting that its management had illegally permitted a hostile work environment in which workers called an Iraqi immigrant a ''camel jockey,'' mocked him with Arab ululations and taunted him over news items about captured terrorists. (The hotel's manager said many of the claims were untrue.)
''There's a level of hatred and animosity that is shocking,'' said Mary Jo O'Neill, regional attorney of the E.E.O.C.'s Phoenix office. ''I've been doing this for 31 years, and I've never seen such antipathy toward Muslim workers.''
Although Muslims make up less than 2 percent of the United States population, they accounted for about one-quarter of the 3,386 religious discrimination claims filed with the E.E.O.C. last year. Complaints filed by Jews rose slightly in fiscal 2009, while complaints filed by Catholics, Protestants, Sikhs and Seventh-day Adventists declined. Claims of race, sex and age discrimination also fell.
The rising number of complaints by Muslims, which exceeds even the amount filed in the year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, comes as tensions rise between Muslim Americans and those of other faiths.
Polls have shown that many Americans feel a growing wariness toward Muslims after the 9/11 attacks and after years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mosques and Islamic community centers in the United States -- most prominently one proposed near ground zero in Manhattan -- have faced substantial opposition. And a Florida pastor received national attention this month for threatening to burn the Koran on Sept. 11.
''We can go back in history and find other times when there were hot emotional and political tensions over religion,'' said Michael J. Zimmer, co-author of several books on employment discrimination and a law professor at Loyola University in Chicago. ''Right now, there is a lot of heat as to the Muslims.''
Mohammad Kaleemuddin, a Pakistani immigrant who drove trucks for the American war effort in Iraq for three years, said that while he was working for a construction company in Houston, his supervisor and several co-workers called him ''Osama,'' ''al Qaeda,'' ''Taliban,'' and ''terrorist.''
''It was very rough,'' said Mr. Kaleemuddin, who was fired after protesting to management about the ethnic slurs. ''It brought a bit of terror in my chest. I'd wonder, 'Why are they doing this? I've always been nice to them.' ''
After he filed a complaint, the E.E.O.C. sued the company he worked for, Pace Services. The company agreed last April to pay him $61,250 to settle the case.
Experts on religion and employment discrimination say many factors are behind this surge in discrimination claims.
''In America right now, there are intense concerns about many issues -- immigration, the faltering economy, the interminable wars'' and the erroneous belief, held by many Americans, that the first nonwhite president is Muslim, said Akbar Ahmed, a professor of Islamic studies at American University.
''In all of these, there's one link, Islam. Islam is the lightning rod. Whenever there is a great distrust or antipathy, it spills beyond religion into public life,'' the professor said.
Professor Ahmed said that Muslims in the United States were generally reluctant to stick their necks out and complain about discrimination, partly in the belief that attitudes toward them will gradually improve. But he said that growing intolerance has prompted more Muslims to stand up for their rights and file E.E.O.C. complaints.
Workers have complained of discrimination even in regions known for their diversity.
Halla Banafa filed a claim with the commission after she was turned down at age 18 for a job stocking merchandise at an Abercrombie Kids store in Milpitas, Calif., in Silicon Valley. According to the E.E.O.C., the manager made a note of ''not Abercrombie look'' on the interview form.
''I never imagined anyone in the Bay Area would reject me because of my head scarf,'' Ms. Banafa said.
Federal law requires employers to accommodate head scarves, also called hijabs, as well as prayer breaks and other practices based on sincere religious beliefs unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer.
''Abercrombie just decided they're not going to comply with the law requiring religious accommodation,'' said William R. Tamayo, regional attorney of the commission's San Francisco office. ''Their intolerance is off the charts.'' Last year, the commission also sued Abercrombie for refusing to hire a 17-year-old wearing a hijab at a store in Tulsa, Okla.
Ronald A. Robins Jr., Abercrombie's general counsel, said the company disputed both claims, adding that the retailer ''makes every reasonable attempt to accommodate the religious practices of associates and applicants, including, when appropriate, allowing associates to wear a hijab.''
In 2004, Abercrombie agreed to pay $40 million to settle an E.E.O.C. lawsuit charging it with racial bias against Asian, black and Hispanic employees, many of whom said they had been steered to low-visibility, back-of-the-store jobs.
At Swift, the meatpacker, the charge of discrimination dates back to 2008, when Somali workers complained that the restroom had profanity-laced anti-Muslim graffiti, that their prayer breaks were often interrupted and that the company would not move their meal breaks to right after sundown during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast during the day. After Muslim employees staged a walkout, the company fired all the protesters, the commission said.
Chandler Keys, a Swift spokesman, declined to discuss the lawsuit, but said that since 2008, the company has had no similar incidents. ''We've worked closely and diligently with the East African community and other groups to avoid a recurrence of such problems,'' he said.
Sometimes sharp disputes arise over whether employers have done enough to accommodate Muslim employees.
Imane Boudlal, a 26-year-old from Casablanca, Morocco, had worked for two years as a hostess at the Storytellers Cafe at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., when she decided she would begin wearing her hijab at work during Ramadan last month. Ms. Boudlal said her supervisors told her that if she insisted on wearing the scarf, she could work either in back or at a telephone job. She refused and has not worked while the dispute continues.
Disney officials said her head scarf clashed with the restaurant's early-1900s theme, and they proposed a period hat with some scarf that would fall over her ears. Ms. Boudlal rejected that as un-Muslim. ''They wanted to hide the fact that I looked Muslim,'' she said.
Michael Griffin, a Disney spokesman, said the company's ''cast members'' agree to comply with its appearance guidelines. ''When cast members request exceptions to our policies for religious reasons, we strive to make accommodations,'' he said, adding that Disney has accommodated more than 200 such requests since 2007.

HEADLINE: The Responsibility Deficit

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
One of the oddities of the current moment is that the country wants a radical change in government but not a radical change in policy.
On the one hand, voters are completely disgusted with Washington. On the other hand, they have not changed their fundamental views on the issues. There has been some shift to the right over the past two years, but the policy landscape looks mostly the way it did over the last few decades. We're still a closely divided nation; it's just that we're angrier about it.
The result is that over the next two years we'll probably see gridlock on stilts. The energized Republicans will try to reduce the size of government, but they won't be able to get their bills past President Obama. The surviving Democrats will try to expand government programs, but they will run smack into a closely divided Senate and possibly a Republican-controlled House. 
Unable to do anything in the short term, both parties will devote their energies to nothing but campaign gestures for 2012. The rhetoric will fly. Childishness will mount. Public nausea will hit an all-time high.
Somewhere in the country, though, there is a politician who is going to try to lead us out of this logjam. Whoever that person is, I hope he or she is listening carefully to what the public is saying. Because when you listen carefully, you notice the public anger doesn't quite match the political class anger. The political class is angry about ideological things: bloated government or the predatory rich. The public seems to be angry about values.
The heart of any moral system is the connection between action and consequences. Today's public anger rises from the belief that this connection has been severed in one realm after another.
Financiers send the world into recession and don't seem to suffer. Neighbors take on huge mortgages and then just walk away when they go underwater. Washington politicians avoid living within their means. Federal agencies fail and get rewarded with more responsibilities.
What the country is really looking for is a restoration of responsibility. If some smart leader is going to help us get out of ideological gridlock, that leader will reframe politics around this end.
Philip K. Howard has thought hard about the decay of responsibility and what can be done to reverse it. In a series of books ranging from ''The Death of Common Sense'' to ''Life Without Lawyers,'' Howard has detailed the ways our political and legal systems undermine personal responsibility.
Over the past several decades, he argues, a thicket of spending obligations, rules and regulations has arisen, which limits individual discretion, narrows room for maneuver and makes it harder to assign responsibility.
Presidents find that more and more of their budgets are precommitted to entitlement spending. Cabinet secretaries find that their agenda can't really be enacted because 100 million words of existing federal rules and statutes prevent innovation this way and that. Even when a new law is passed, it's very hard to tell who is responsible for executing it because there is a profusion of agencies and bureaucratic levels all with some share of the pie.
These things weaken individual initiative, discretion and responsibility. But the decay expands well beyond Washington. Teachers don't really control their classrooms. They have to obey a steady stream of mandates that govern everything from how they treat an unruly child to the way they teach. Doctors don't really control their practices but must be wary of a capricious malpractice system that could strike at any moment. Local government officials don't really govern their towns. Their room for maneuver is sharply constrained by federal mandates and by the steady stream of lawsuits that push them in ways defying common sense.
What's needed, Howard argues, is a great streamlining. He's not calling for deregulation. It's about giving teachers, doctors and officials the power to actually make decisions and then holding them accountable. Some of their choices will be wrong, Howard acknowledges, but it is better to live in an imperfect world of individual responsibility than it is to live within a dehumanizing legal thicket that seeks to eliminate risk through a tangle of micromanaging statutes.
Howard proposes expanding specialized health courts, which would be more predictable than the malpractice system. He would lift controls on teachers and civil servants -- giving them more freedom but then ending tenure and holding them accountable. He would create commissions to eliminate obsolete laws. He would expand judges' discretion and end mandatory sentencing.
Howard's agenda raises some thorny issues. But he has seized the crucial theme of the moment. If bad government undermines responsibility then it should be restructured. And he's offering one tool a creative politician could use to break through the logjam and help us avoid a truly awful few years.

HEADLINE: The Bowery's New, Narrow Showcase for Art

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Back in the fall of 2008, when Sperone Westwater Gallery announced plans to construct an eight-story building of its own on the Bowery, it seemed a bold but possibly foolhardy idea. Almost a year into the great recession, it did not appear to be the most propitious moment for such a daring and expensive move.
Despite the New Museum's new building a block south of the designated site and several dozen smaller galleries recently opening in the neighborhood, it was not clear that the Lower East Side was destined to supplant Chelsea as the go-to place for contemporary-art enthusiasts. 
But the gallery plunged bravely ahead, and this week its new, eight-story Foster + Partners-designed edifice opened with a less-than-dazzling exhibition of paintings by the Argentine artist Guillermo Kuitca.
A sliver of a building just 25 feet wide and 100 feet deep squeezed between shorter, nondescript structures, it has a facade of corrugated glass from the second floor to the top that gives the effect of a giant plastic lenticular lens. The glass front is framed by black I-beams, and the sides are clad in corrugated metal, also painted black. More toolbox than jewel box, the building has an oddly cheap, low-tech and utilitarian appearance, like that of a discount-furniture emporium.
Its most remarkable feature is a king-size elevator painted red on the outside. Visible from the street, it rises and falls behind the glass front between the second and fourth floors. It will be used as a moving gallery, where viewers may contemplate installations while riding up and down.
The first installation, by Mr. Kuitca, is ''Le Sacre, 1992,'' a set of 54 child-size mattresses covering three walls, each bearing a hand-painted copy of a map of a randomly selected place somewhere in the world. Painted in dingy colors, the mattresses create the gloomy, claustrophobic feeling of a freight elevator. What other artists might do with this new toy could be interesting, but for now the novelty does not seem worth what it must have cost.
In contrast with Sperone Westwater's former second-floor gallery on West 13th Street, which had an expansive, wider-than-tall main exhibition space, the new galleries are unpromisingly long and narrow shoeboxes stacked three stories high. More rooms on upper floors are for private viewings.
The second floor is actually a mezzanine with a curvy, waist-high glass balustrade overlooking the main first-floor gallery; it faces a 27-foot wall extending from the first floor to the ceiling of the second. The third floor is conventionally boxy, and, to put it kindly, intimate. All in all, it looks like a pretty awkward showcase for art.
As for the recent paintings by Mr. Kuitca distributed about the three public viewing floors, if the idea was to mount a show that would not compete with the new architecture, then it is a success.
A tiresome, postmodernist meditation on the aesthetics and sociology of cosmopolitan modernity, Mr. Kuitca's art exudes a dour, unfocused mood. He works with a brusque, impatient touch in mostly grays, browns and other muted colors on canvases ranging from laptop-size to Abstract Expressionist scale, mixing and matching loops of thorny vines, architectural plans, geographical maps and passages of Cubist faceting that look as if they were lifted from early paintings by Picasso and Braque.
In the best works, as in a canvas about 6 by 12 feet entirely covered by a field of gray, Cubist, shardlike forms, there is considerable formal punch. A smaller, untitled canvas in which a red field is penetrated by variously angled, illusionistic slits a la Lucio Fontana, over which barbed-wire-like coils of thorny vines are painted, hints at a relationship between Christian tragedy (i.e., a crown of thorns) and Modernist despair.
A sympathetic viewer primed by the sort of European theoretical writings that became popular in the art world in the '80s might discover more such deep philosophical meanings in Mr. Kuitca's visually lifeless sampling of Modernist motifs. What if anything personal he might have at stake remains obscure. It leaves a viewer hungry for something wild and crazy.
Guillermo Kuitca, ''Paintings, 2008-2010'' and ''Le Sacre, 1992'' are on view through Nov. 6 at Sperone Westwater, 257 Bowery, Lower East Side; (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com.

HEADLINE: Under Tax-Exempt Cloak, Political Dollars Flow

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Alaskans grew suspicious two years ago when a national organization called Americans for Job Security showed up and spent $1.6 million pushing a referendum to restrict development of a gold and copper mine at the headwaters of Bristol Bay.
It seemed an oddly parochial fight for a pro-business group based in the Washington suburbs that had spent tens of millions of dollars since the late 1990s roughing up Democrats with negative advertisements around election time.
But after the mine's supporters filed a complaint with the state, it became clear that what was depicted as grass-roots opposition was something else entirely: Americans for Job Security, investigators found, had helped create the illusion of a popular upwelling to shield the identity of a local financier who paid for most of the referendum campaign. More broadly, they said, far from being a national movement advocating a ''pro-paycheck message,'' the group is actually a front for a coterie of political operatives, devised to sidestep campaign disclosure rules.
''Americans for Job Security has no purpose other than to cover various money trails all over the country,'' the staff of the Alaska Public Offices Commission said in a report last year. 
The report went mostly unnoticed outside Anchorage. But its conclusions suddenly loom large in the current debate over nonprofit advocacy groups like Americans for Job Security, which campaign watchdogs say allow moneyed interests to influence elections without revealing themselves. Congress is now wrangling over a bill that would require some disclosure.
With every election cycle comes a shadow army of benignly titled nonprofit groups like Americans for Job Security, devoted to politically charged ''issue advocacy,'' much of it negative. But they are now being heard as never before -- in this year of midterm discontent, Tea Party ferment and the first test of the Supreme Court decision allowing unlimited, and often anonymous, corporate political spending. Already they have spent more than $100 million -- mostly for Republicans and more than twice as much as at this point four years ago.
None have been more active than Americans for Job Security, which spent $6 million on ads during the primary season. This week, emboldened by the court ruling, the group paid close to $4 million more for ads directly attacking nine Democratic candidates for Congress. That made it among the first to abandon the old approach of running ads that stopped just short of explicitly urging voters to elect or reject individual candidates.
Americans for Job Security says it is careful to hew to tax and campaign-finance laws: It may not spend the majority of its resources on political activity or coordinate with party committees, and may keep its donors secret only as long as their contributions are not intended for specific ad campaigns close to an election. Instead of earmarked donations, the group says, it collects membership dues and then decides, on its own, how to spend the money.
''We believe issue advocacy is much more effective than banging down doors of members of Congress,'' said the group's president, Stephen DeMaura. ''And you now have the Supreme Court of the United States reaffirming our rights.''
An examination of Americans for Job Security -- based on a review of its recent activities, as well as on interviews and previously unreleased documents from the Alaska case -- provides a rare look inside the opaque world of these ascendant advocacy organizations. Its deep ties to a Republican consulting operation raise questions about whether, under cover of its tax-exempt mission ''to promote a strong, job-creating economy,'' the group is largely a funnel for anonymous donations.
''A lot of nonprofits game the system, but A.J.S. is unusual in that they so blatantly try to influence elections and evade disclosure,'' said Taylor Lincoln, a research director at the watchdog group Public Citizen, which has filed complaints against the group in recent years. ''By any common-sense, reasonable interpretation of what they do, they are in violation of the rules.''
Political Office Mates
The group's Republican connections begin with location: While its public address is a drop box at a United Parcel Service store in Alexandria, Va., Mr. DeMaura actually works out of space that is sublet from a Republican consulting shop, Crossroads Media, whose other clients include the national Republican Party, the Republican Governors Association and American Crossroads, a Karl Rove-backed group raising millions to support Republican candidates.
Crossroads Media is run by Michael Dubke and David Carney, who along with several business groups helped start Americans for Job Security in 1997. Mr. Carney had been political director for President George Bush, and Mr. Dubke was the first executive director and then president of Americans for Job Security until April 2008, when Mr. DeMaura, recruited by Mr. Carney, took over.
The office space in Alexandria that the group shares with Crossroads Media -- Suite 555 at 66 Canal Center Plaza, overlooking the Potomac -- is home to at least three other political consulting firms, including the Black Rock Group, which Mr. Dubke runs with Carl Forti, a longtime Republican operative who is political director for American Crossroads.
As for Mr. DeMaura, it turns out he is the sole employee of Americans for Job Security, a 25-year-old former executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party who cut his political teeth as an undergraduate by starting an anti-Hillary ClintonFacebook page.
The chairwoman of the group's board of directors is listed in tax filings as Tabitha Connor, a Columbia University graduate student, also in her 20s. She did not respond to requests for comment.
According to testimony in the Alaska case, the board meets once every two years, and there are no committees or written policies shaping decisions about ad campaigns. Mr. DeMaura said he made those calls. He disputed suggestions that he was influenced by the consultants with whom he shares an office.
''I work with them closely on a day-to-day basis, but we don't discuss our work or coordinate anything,'' he said. ''It's firewalled off.''
Mr. Dubke, too, denied that the agenda of Americans for Job Security was driven by the political interests of his firms.
''Nothing is ever done in coordination with another campaign,'' he said. ''I'm always trying to follow the letter of the law.''
Still, while he is no longer an officer of Americans for Job Security, Mr. Dubke remains a consultant and has authority to countersign its checks. Crossroads Media also places many of the group's ads.
Blurred Boundaries
It is sometimes hard to discern the boundaries separating Americans for Job Security from the consultants in its office suite and the interests of their Republican clients.
This month in upstate New York, the National Republican Congressional Committee -- a sometime client of Mr. Dubke's -- sent local reporters an Americans for Job Security announcement and transcript of a new ad opposing a Democratic congressman, Representative Michael Arcuri. A committee spokesman said he was not coordinating anything with the advocacy group, but merely passing along ''a public document.'' The document, however, could not be found on the group's Web site, and a reporter who received it said the committee was his only source for it.
In May, the group ran an ad attacking a labor-backed Democrat in an Arkansas Senate primary, Bill Halter, for having served on the board of a technology company that opened an office in India. The ad -- placed by Crossroads and produced by another Republican-connected company in the office suite, WWP Strategies -- played ethnic music, featured Indians in colorful garb expressing gratitude toward Mr. Halter for their jobs, and was widely derided as insulting toward people from India.
And in Texas in 2008, while Mr. DeMaura's office mates were consulting for the state Republican Party, he requested records from the Nueces County sheriff's office on an incident in which a woman ran naked from the home of a prominent Democratic donor, who was arrested after flashing a phony badge at the police. The disgraced donor was soon featured in a Republican Party television ad linking him to Democratic candidates for the Texas legislature. Mr. DeMaura said his request was not connected to the ad, but would not explain why he had sought the records.
Other aspects of the group's operations have come under scrutiny as well. In 2007, Public Citizen filed complaints with the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission, contending that Americans for Job Security spent the vast majority of its resources electioneering -- running ads close to elections -- contrary to I.R.S. guidelines for tax-exempt, nonprofit business groups.
Public Citizen said it never heard back from the I.R.S. At the election commission, staff lawyers agreed that there was ''reason to believe'' that the group had violated campaign finance laws, and recommended a full investigation. But the commission deadlocked along party lines, and the complaint was dropped.
Because Americans for Job Security was formed as a tax-exempt business league -- known as a 501(c)(6) in the tax code -- it does not have to report its sources of income. Federal election rules, though, require that when a group accepts a donation earmarked for an electioneering ad, the donor must be identified.
Americans for Job Security avoids disclosure by reporting all its revenue as ''membership dues.'' It claims more than 1,000 members. But a review of its tax returns shows membership revenue fluctuating wildly depending on election cycles -- similar to the fund-raising of political committees that escalates during campaign season.
''Membership dues and assessments'' totaled $7 million in the 2004 presidential election, and dipped to $1.2 million the following year before climbing back to $3.9 million for the 2006 midterm elections. Then, in 2007, they plunged to zero before shooting up to $12.2 million for the 2008 presidential race.
Asked how it could have collected no dues in 2007, neither Mr. Dubke nor Mr. DeMaura offered an answer. Mr. DeMaura said that there is no set membership fee and that members are not required to pay annually.
''They can if they want,'' he said.
A Hidden Hand in Alaska
Probably the most extensive look at the operations of Americans for Job Security came during the inquiry in Alaska. Through a public information request, The New York Times obtained records from the investigation, including the group's internal e-mails and memorandums, as well as the sworn testimony of Mr. Dubke and others.
The group ended up in Alaska through Mr. Dubke's work for opponents of the proposed Pebble Mine, led by an Alaska financier, Robert Gillam, whose private fishing lodge could be affected. The opponents said the mine would endanger commercial fishing and pushed a ballot initiative aimed at imposing clean-water restrictions on it; its backers said the mine would create jobs.
Mr. Dubke's work for Mr. Gillam was called Operation Trenchcoat, documents show, and involved finding out who was behind a pro-mine Web site called Bob Gillam Can't Buy Alaska. Mr. Gillam testified that he spoke with Mr. Dubke about Americans for Job Security, and decided to join by giving $2 million in ''membership fees,'' and that he ''had high hopes'' the money would be used to oppose the mine. (The ballot initiative ultimately failed.)
State investigators found that the advocacy group quickly passed almost all the money to another nonprofit, Alaskans for Clean Water, set up to campaign for the referendum by a group that included Art Hackney, a local Republican consultant and board member of Americans for Job Security. Mr. DeMaura told investigators that while he may have talked to Mr. Dubke about the mine issue, he decided to spend the money ''based upon his own research and judgment,'' and that there was no prior agreement with Mr. Gillam or Mr. Dubke.
The Alaska Public Offices Commission's staff report called this ''completely implausible'' and concluded that Americans for Job Security had violated state law by acting as an improper conduit. It also took a shot at the group's explanation that it protects its members' identities so they can speak out without fear of reprisals.
''One would hardly expect reprisals for 'promoting a healthy and vibrant economy,' '' the report said.
The group's lawyers accused the staff of making ''reckless and baseless'' accusations and of ''misrepresenting a respected entity like A.J.S., known nationally for its skill and sophistication in conducting educational and issue-related campaigns.'' In a legal filing, they also worried that the allegations could be noticed ''by the local, and potentially national, press.''
Americans for Job Security eventually paid a $20,000 settlement without admitting guilt and agreed not to help anyone make anonymous contributions in an election in Alaska -- with the condition that its pledge ''does not apply to any other jurisdiction which may have laws dissimilar to the state.''

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE: Insuring Young Adults

BYLINE: By KEVIN QUEALY

 BODY:
For young Americans with no health insurance, Thursday was an important day: those younger than 26 were able to join their parents' plans under the recently enacted health care overhaul. (Previously, children were dropped from their parents' policies at 19, or 23 if they were full-time students.) Young people make up the largest group of uninsured Americans, although they are healthier and cheaper to insure. And they are much less likely to vote.Still, in many states with high rates of uninsured young adults, providing health coverage is not at the forefront of political campaigns. Below, the areas of the country with high rates of uninsured, and how health care is playing out as an issue in those areas: 
RACES IN STATES WITH HIGH RATES OF UNINSURED YOUNG ADULTS
50% Texas has the nation's highest rate of uninsured young adults. In the 17th Congressional District, one of the closest House races in Texas, Representative Chet Edwards, a Democrat, highlights his vote against the health care bill in his advertisements against Bill Flores, a Republican.
46% Georgia has the second-highest rate. Nathan Deal, a Republican former congressman running for governor, says he will vigorously fight the health care law if elected. His opponent, former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, has focused on jobs and education in his campaign.
41% In Nevada, 41 percent of young adults have no health insurance, the nation's sixth-highest rate. Still, high foreclosure and unemployment rates are more prominent campaign issues than health care in the close race between Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat, and Sharron Angle, a Republican backed by the Tea Party.

HEADLINE: A Dreamlike Tale of a Gay Hustler

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
''I like adventure,'' says the boyish gay hustler (Ben Bonenfant) at the heart of ''Strapped,'' Joseph Graham's dreamlike debut feature. The statement may or may not be true, but it helps fabricate the persona of the moment: what makes this particular young man desirable -- aside from a guileless face, a knowing body and a sweet disposition -- is the facility to morph into whomever his customer most desires. 
Over the course of one long, rainy night in a labyrinthine apartment building, the hustler will play a long-lost friend, a reminder of spent youth and a dangerous liaison, each successive encounter nudging him toward self-examination. The film's intellectual aspirations are evident (the dialogue is peppered with Foucault and Shakespeare), but not oppressively so, and the actors perform with an ease that smoothes the story's episodic structure. Especially notable are Paul Gerrior, as an aging civil-rights warrior, and Nick Frangione, as a lonely trick more interested in connection than sex.
Moodily lighted and photographed by Matthew Boyd (whose work belies the production's ultra-low budget), ''Strapped'' grafts familiar gay stereotypes onto an unfamiliar template. Filling the screen with orgasmic faces rather than thrashing bodies, Mr. Graham's economical style encourages multiple readings of each stop on a journey we all take sooner or later, whatever our sexual orientation.
STRAPPED
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Written and directed by Joseph Graham; director of photography, Matthew Boyd; edited by Sharon Franklin; music by Count; production designer, William King; costumes by Premstar Santana; produced by Mr. Graham and Bill Parker; released by TLA Releasing. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes. This film is not rated.
WITH: Ben Bonenfant (the Hustler), Artem Mishin (John), Michael Carlisi (Gypsy Troubadour), Carlo D'Amore (Leon), Raphael Barker (Jacob), Paul Gerrior (Sam), Nick Frangione (Gary) and John Kiernan (Tommy).

HEADLINE: Following the Dots Around the City

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Autumn in New York is the perfect time for an accidental festival of the work of the Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. This one is made possible by three separate exhibitions spread around Manhattan, which seems only fitting. After all (and perhaps surprisingly), Lichtenstein was one of the few great American painters of the postwar era born on the island of Manhattan: in 1923, into the cushier precincts of the Upper West Side. He attended public school and then the private Franklin School for Boys before heading off to Ohio State University to study painting. He died in Manhattan in 1997.
Lichtenstein's art forms an ode to the Americana of comic books and commercial art, but it has about it a brisk cosmopolitanism that is also New York at its most New York, which is in the fall. The closest analogy may be musical: the songs of Broadway composers like Cole Porter, which radiate the energy of vernacular language being put in perfect working order. 
Perfect working order is what Lichtenstein was all about. And the loose-jointed survey of his economics afforded by these shows is all the more pleasant for being interrupted by large swaths of the city, which works pretty darned well in spite of everything. You can alternate views of Lichtenstein's genius with healthy intakes of urban life and draw your own conclusions from the shows' overlaps and discrepancies, whether with one another or reality.
The most substantial effort is the Morgan Library & Museum's brilliant ''Roy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-White Drawings, 1961-1968,'' which concentrates exclusively on the large finished drawings that heralded the arrival of his bold mature style. It is a high-octane affair suffused with the energy of an artist rapidly getting up to speed and reinventing drawing as he goes.
A broader view is taken by ''Roy Lichtenstein: Mostly Men'' at the Leo Castelli Gallery on the Upper East Side. Its 25 works concentrate on depictions of men, skimming across a career more identified with anxious young women. And in Chelsea, Mitchell-Innes & Nash rounds out the bill with ''Roy Lichtenstein Reflected,'' which features 10 paintings, mostly from the late 1980s and early '90s, that one way or another depict mirrors. While more routine it gets to the heart of Lichtenstein's concerns. As each show has its own catalog, a kind of Lichtenstein Festschrift also accrues.
The Morgan is definitely the place to start. It brings a new clarity to Lichtenstein's evolution by focusing on the drawing materials and methods that made his beguiling advertising and comic-book images possible. It counters the anonymity of touch typically ascribed to his work by revealing the care, thought and effort that went into his ultracool look, which isn't so hands-off after all.
Despite the 1961 of the title, the two earliest works here are from 1958, the year after Lichtenstein returned to the New York area after about 15 years away, during which time he served in the Army (1943-46), earned undergraduate and graduate degrees at Ohio State and also taught there.
Like many artists his age in the 1950s, he was looking for a way around the histrionics, spontaneity and open-endedness of Abstract Expressionism. Contact with Allan Kaprow while both were teaching at Rutgers University especially helped sharpen his senses to the potential of everyday visual culture.
The two 1958 works depict Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse in brush and ink amid tornadoes of Abstract Expressionist gesture. We see no more of the style until the end of the show, when Lichtenstein wryly honors it with cartoon depictions of swashbuckling brushstrokes against Benday-dot backgrounds.
In between comes a parade of indelible no-nonsense objects and characters culled from American printed matter: comic-book fighter pilots in the heat of battle, Greek temples, sunsets, a hot dog, a ball of twine, a wide-eyed gas station attendant and a fabulous bathing beauty with piled curls and radial eyes.
In these Lichtenstein rebuilds drawing from the ground up with a canny mix of commercial and fine-art techniques that accommodates a tremendous range of tones and textures. A crucial breakthrough, first evident at the Morgan in the seemingly heated ''Conversation'' of 1962, was the switch from wet to dry drawing mediums. Until graphite replaced brush or pen and ink, many of the drawings look too much like real commercial art: set to go to the printer and then be thrown out.
Dry materials facilitated the pursuit of the Benday dots, intimated first by making graphite rubbings on window screen and then evoked more accurately by forcing lithographic rubbing crayon through a small sheet of metal, hand-drilled with rows of holes. (These tools and others are displayed in a vitrine.)
Making dry versions of images originally drawn and then printed in ink, Lichtenstein altered their DNA, slowing them down into collagelike constructions that for all their boldness sustain old-masterish savoring. The artist's hand is everywhere, adjusting the density of the dots from faint to dark (sometimes by doubling them up), filling in areas so that even finer lines have a slightly chiseled, insistent roughness, and making useful discoveries.
In ''Bread and Jam'' the gleam of the plate jumps out as something new. You can imagine Lichtenstein chuckling at the effect -- fake image, real light. What is perhaps most striking is his determination to have the entire sheet of paper come alive and register as a whole. This electricity unifies nearly all his paintings, edge to edge, with a bracing combination of the familiar and the abstract that still has few equals in modern art.
The Castelli show offers a change from the relative tunnel vision of the Morgan exhibition, branching out to include paintings and sculptures and the bonbonlike colored-pencil studies. (It incidentally complements ''Roy Lichtenstein: Girls,'' a 2008 exhibition that was at the Gagosian Gallery around the corner.)
Several works at Castelli are being shown for the first time in New York. ''Indian,'' a small painting from 1951, when Lichtenstein was still in Ohio, reduces the male figure to a starlike tangle of points and angles that becomes a pictorial staple. A surrogate for both geometric abstraction and men, this form is often paired here with a sinuously Surrealist lock of blond hair and red lips. In ''Indian,'' however, it is on its own, embellished with a few leaves or feathers and a pair of eyes. The work not only reflects careful attention to Picasso, but also presages Jasper Johns's splayed-face motifs from the late '80s, which were also inspired by Picasso.
Other first-timers include two nearly identical paintings from 1961 of an image of a Sinatra-like playboy that could have been lifted from a matchbook cover. One is ''Portrait of Allan Kaprow''; the other is ''Portrait of Ivan Karp,'' after the art dealer who, as Leo Castelli's right-hand man, advocated that both Lichtenstein and Warhol be shown. They also bring to mind ''Factum I'' and its copy ''Factum II'' -- two works with which Robert Rauschenberg sent up the deathless uniqueness of the Abstract Expressionist brushwork.
Other works to seek out here include ''The Conversation,'' a 1984 painted and patinated bronze sculpture of a Surrealist female head paired with a male head that is all right angles and exaggerated wood-grain, and a 1997 drawing that is unlike any work of his I've ever seen. It resembles one of Matisse's brush-and-ink nudes, except that it portrays a debonair young man in a suit. Moreover, its thick lines are charcoal, filled-in and a little rough -- another wet-dry conversion that evokes his approach in the Morgan show. It signals a phase of late work that Lichtenstein, sadly, was unable to complete.
''Roy Lichtenstein Reflected'' at Mitchell-Innes & Nash does not achieve the curatorial density of the other two shows, but nearly every painting is a scintillating world unto itself, a bolt of Lichtenstein electricity. It is as if the gleam on the plate in ''Bread and Jam'' in the drawing at the Morgan had exploded into the mirror theme.
The essential, slyly reflective nature of Lichtenstein's art is made palpable. He is always mirroring the world back to us, his own art included, as suggested here by two paintings in which his signature blonde all but disappears into shards and shafts of reflection. As such, the Mitchell-Innes ensemble forms a fantastic finale to the three shows, providing one view after another of a vernacular language fine-tuned to perfect working order. It's delovely.
''Roy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-White Drawings, 1961-1968'' is on view through Jan. 2 at the Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street; (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. ''Roy Lichtenstein: Mostly Men'' continues through Oct. 30 at the Leo Castelli Gallery, 18 East 77th Street, Manhattan; (212) 249-4470; ''Roy Lichtenstein Reflected'' is on view through Oct. 30 at Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea; (212) 744-7400.

HEADLINE: A Film Festival With a Penchant for Making Tastes, Not Deals

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
The New York Film Festival -- which begins its 48th iteration Friday night at Lincoln Center with a gala screening of ''The Social Network'' -- is at once buoyed and burdened by its past. This is true of other festivals, too. Spend a few hours at Sundance or Cannes and you are bound to hear someone conjuring up the old days, when indie film really, you know, mattered or when Marcello Mastroianniwas standing right over there.
And so as the crowds filter into Alice Tully Hall and the Walter Reade Theater between now and Oct. 10, shadows of earlier times are likely to flicker across the marble and glass. This was where, in the '60s and '70s, the French and German New Waves -- particularly represented by Godard and Fassbinder -- broke on North American soil, and where local audiences in subsequent decades became aware of the boom times in Asian and American independent cinema. Remember? 
But though such backward glances are part of the festival atmosphere, they are not really the point. When you watch a movie you sit facing forward, and the festival's annual program -- a relatively small bouquet of new films, selected and arranged by a committee of critics and programmers -- is both a sampling of the present and an intimation of the future. Other festivals are more comprehensive or more attuned to the business of buying, selling and publicizing films. New York, though, is about something else: discrimination, criticism, the formation of taste.
''We're saying, 'Here are the 25 essential films of this year,' '' said Rose Kuo, the new executive director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which oversees the festival. ''We're telling you that you should see these things. We're making a statement about film culture.''
Ms. Kuo, hired in June to replace Mara Manus -- a change so abrupt that it took many in the film world by surprise, not least Ms. Kuo herself -- takes over at a time of ambitious growth and economic uncertainty. The nonprofit fund-raising climate is as grim as the job market, and the film society is about to add two new theaters, a cafe and a bookstore as part of the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, which will open early next year.
Ms. Kuo, most recently the artistic director of the AFI Fest in Los Angeles, said she hoped to expand the film society's audience without diluting its tradition of programming ambitious and sometimes challenging films.
''This is a public endeavor,'' she said, ''a conversation with the public. That means talking and listening and having opinions -- and sometimes your opinions aren't well received.''
This year the selection committee (led by Richard Pena, the film society's longtime head of programming, and including the critics Todd McCarthy, Melissa Anderson, Scott Foundas and Dennis Lim, a frequent contributor to The New York Times) was blessed with good luck and guided by a spirit of eclecticism. In some previous years, the available pool of work has been weaker or thinner, and the committee has at times pursued a narrow aesthetic agenda at odds with the essential heterogeneity of the art form.
The opening-night attraction, David Fincher's latest, about the founding of Facebook, is one of the most anticipated releases of the year, having inspired quite a lot of debate before anyone has even seen it. It may be the movie of the moment, but its place in this festival, alongside low-key realist dramas, form-bending documentaries and surreal explorations of the natural world, suggests that the moment is much more complicated, more layered with echoes from the past, than we might suspect.
The other two gala presentations, the centerpiece and closing night films, are Julie Taymor's adaptation of ''The Tempest'' and Clint Eastwood's ''Hereafter,'' a quiet and contemplative examination of the possibility of some kind of life after death. ''The Tempest,'' Shakespeare's last play, is among other things a tale of leave-taking and last things, and the youthful aggression of ''The Social Network'' is balanced by quite a few films that explore age, ripeness and mortality.
None quite as boldly as ''Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives,'' the latest feature from the Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul. ''Uncle Boonmee'' won the top prize in Cannes this year, to the surprise of nearly everyone and the dismay of some who grumbled that the jury had somehow gone too far in honoring something so esoteric, so puzzling, so downright weird.
It is all of those things, but ''Uncle Boonmee,'' filmed mostly in the forests of Northeastern Thailand, is also dreamy, funny and surpassingly gentle, a pastoral ghost story that seems driven by a serene tolerance of the mysteries of the universe. There are talking monkeys with laser-beam eyes, an amorous catfish (who also talks), various apparitions and narrative digressions (to the extent that there is a narrative at all). You could react with impatience, but the title character's acceptance of the strangeness that surrounds him serves as a guide to watching the film, which can, if you allow it, alter your sense of the relationship between human beings and the natural world.
That relationship is something of a motif at this year's festival. Some of the most memorable films are journeys into landscapes, some drab, some gorgeous. Patrick Keiller's ''Robinson in Ruins,'' a historical essay on the rise and fall of capitalism built around the adventures of an unseen fictional protagonist, is composed of lingering glances at road signs, old bridges, crumbling houses and other everyday vistas. Aleksei Fedorchenko's ''Silent Souls'' infuses the waterways and meadows of northern Russia with a melancholy soul. And ''Le Quattro Volte'' by Michelangelo Frammartino turns its crazily sublime views of the Italian countryside into an animist tour de force. One of the principal characters is a tree, and most of the dialogue is in goat, without subtitles.
But there is plenty of human drama to be found at the festival: in ''Tuesday, After Christmas,'' an unsparing anatomy of everyday adultery and its consequences from the Romanian director Radu Muntean; in ''Poetry,'' an exquisite melodrama by the South Korean filmmaker (and former minister of culture) Lee Chang-dong, about an elderly woman struggling with incipient Alzheimer's disease and her beloved grandson's involvement in a nasty crime; and in ''Of Gods and Men,'' by Xavier Beauvois, the quietly intense story of a community of French monks caught up in the Algerian civil war of the 1990s.
And this is only the beginning, and only a sampling. There will also be documentaries about John Lennon and Elia Kazan, discussions with filmmakers (including Mr. Fincher and Mr. Apichatpong) and judiciously chosen revival programs. Enough to make you forget about the old days, at least until next year.
The 48th New York Film Festival runs through Oct. 10. Most movies will be shown in Alice Tully Hall or the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Information: (212) 875-5050; tickets: (212) 721-6500; filmlinc.com.

HEADLINE: In TV Ad, Cuomo Levels First Attack on Paladino

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo, leaving little doubt that he is concerned about his Republican opponent, Carl P. Paladino, unleashed his first direct attack on Mr. Paladino on Thursday with a television advertisement that criticized him for his donations to Albany politicians and for his failure to create jobs after winning tax breaks intended to promote economic development.
The advertisement was released one day after signs emerged that Mr. Paladino, a novice candidate with Tea Party support who had an upset victory in the Republican primary for governor, was showing unexpected strength, including a poll that found him to be surprisingly close to Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat and the state's attorney general. 
The poll, by Quinnipiac University, startled the Democratic establishment, which had viewed a victory by Mr. Cuomo as inevitable, and prompted public calls for the attorney general to start returning his opponent's volleys. Mr. Paladino, a wealthy and pugnacious businessman, has leveled a series of colorful attacks that have made him a wild card against the much more popular -- and much more cautious -- Mr. Cuomo.
Although a new poll released on Thursday by Siena College showed a wider gap, Mr. Cuomo, who had previously seemed determined to keep Mr. Paladino at arm's length, appeared to be springing into action. But the Cuomo campaign said that the new advertisement was unrelated to any poll and that the decision to run it had been made days ago.
Mr. Cuomo's campaign would not say where or on which stations the advertisement would run, or how much was being spent to broadcast it, making it difficult to assess how aggressively Mr. Cuomo had decided to counterattack. While Mr. Paladino is well known in western New York, where overwhelming support from voters powered his defeat of Rick A. Lazio in the primary, he is not as widely known in New York City and its suburbs.
Mr. Cuomo's advertisement describes Mr. Paladino as ''a landlord and developer'' and a ''welfare king,'' suggesting that his campaign contributions to elected officials had earned him real estate deals. The advertisement also says that one of Mr. Paladino's companies was granted $1.4 million worth of state tax breaks for a development that created only one job.
Mr. Paladino's campaign did not dispute details of the advertisement, but a spokesman, Michael Caputo, suggested that it illustrated Mr. Cuomo's misunderstanding of the business world.
''Andrew Cuomo's opening gambit falls flat,'' Mr. Caputo said in a statement. ''Any day our campaign wakes up talking about Carl Paladino's business and his 450 employees is a good day for Carl Paladino.''
The new Siena Research Institute poll showed Mr. Cuomo leading Mr. Paladino 57 percent to 24 percent, with Mr. Lazio, who remains in the race as the Conservative Party candidate, at 8 percent. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Mr. Cuomo's campaign released a second advertisement on Thursday that featured a woman who benefited from a legal battle by Mr. Cuomo against her insurance company after she received a diagnosis of cancer and the company refused to cover tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs. The woman, who lives on Long Island, describes herself as a Republican who is voting for Mr. Cuomo.
But it was Mr. Cuomo's other advertisement that stirred the most buzz in the political world. Mr. Cuomo seemed to be trying to define Mr. Paladino not as the Tea Party-supported firebrand promoted by his campaign, but as the wealthy, connected and politically active businessman he was before running for governor.
Mr. Caputo defended Mr. Paladino's record as a businessman -- his companies have earned millions of dollars renting space to state agencies -- and noted that the top official in charge of such contracts had described Mr. Paladino as a ''good landlord.''
''Carl Paladino is one of New York's most successful businessmen,'' Mr. Caputo said in his statement, ''and he welcomes the focus on his leadership. So read this with the snicker that accompanies it: Br'er Andrew, please don't throw us into the brier patch.''

HEADLINE: Old West Traditions, and Tensions, at Rodeo

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
PENDLETON, Ore. -- The sign at the entrance to the rodeo's bleachers said ''Wrist Bands Required.'' So Reggie Queampts dutifully wore his: ''2010 Round-Up NDN Seating.''
''That's NDN -- as in 'Indian,' '' said Mr. Queampts, a member of the Yakama Nation. ''This is where they usually put the Indians, the cheap seats.''
The Pendleton Round-Up -- which celebrated its centennial last weekend -- did not become one of the West's oldest, biggest and most beloved rodeos by bucking tradition. The arena where it is held just underwent an $8.5 million renovation, but the bulls still burst out of weathered old wooden bucking shoots. The names of corporate sponsors are not splashed on the arena walls. No motorized vehicles are allowed at the ''Westward Ho!'' parade that coincides with the rodeo, only people and horses and wagon wheels. Even rodeo riders are impressed with the frontier authenticity of this high-desert town in eastern Oregon.
''This one is different,'' said Paul Eaves, a Texan who travels the country roping steer on the rodeo circuit. ''This is a cowboy town.'' 
And that, some Indians say, can be a problem. Some are offended by the sun-scorched bleachers where they get to sit for free (anyone can pay to sit in the shaded grandstand). Others are uncomfortable with Indians' daily appearances in traditional dress in the rodeo arena -- where they are applauded but not expected to stay long. Some say the Round-Up sends mixed signals to the Native Americans who have lived here for thousands of years: we want you, in your place.
That is an attitude with plenty of Western tradition as well.
''They did all these renovations and improvements but the Indians are still sitting out in the sun,'' said Fred Hill, a board member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, which includes the Cayuse, Walla Walla and Umatilla tribes. ''Everybody has taken notice of it.''
One Indian woman, gesturing toward those in the Indian section on a hot afternoon, said, ''It's a subclass.''
Yet Indians have been choosing to come to Round-Up since it began, and this year's turnout was particularly strong.
''The story, as it goes,'' said Carl Culham, a Round-Up board member and the publicity director, ''is that the first board of directors in determining what the Pendleton Round-Up was, decided that we need Native American participation but it had to be more realistic than things like Bill Cody Wild West Shows.''
With the help the owners of the Pendleton Woolen Mills, a system of bartering and stipends was developed in which Indians were given food and blankets and paid to set up teepees in the Teepee Village, directly outside the arena. Some were paid -- and many still are -- to participate in an outdoor theater performance that still goes on called ''Happy Canyon.'' Adults recall appearing in the arena as children in traditional Indian dress, then receiving silver dollars from rodeo organizers as they made their exit.
A century later, the mill still provides blankets, and families are still paid to appear, $5 per person each day at the arena. Beef and vegetables are provided, as are tokens for other food. The winner of the ''Best Dressed Indian Award'' at the parade gets 50 silver dollars. The winner of the ''Oldest Indian Couple Award'' gets 100 silver dollars in a pouch.
Blankets are also among the gifts for the ''All-Around Cowboy Award,'' though silver dollars are not. And there have long been prominent Indian riders in the regular rodeo, in addition to those who ride bareback in the raucous Indian relay races.
One of the Round-Up's most famous rodeo champions is Jackson Sundown, a Nez Perce Indian who won it all in 1916 when he was over 50 years old. Earlier, in 1911, after judges denied first place to a popular black rider, George Fletcher, the crowd roared its disapproval and soon collected money on his behalf, more than he would have received had he won, according to historical accounts.
The weeklong event goes on now much as it did before. Over the years, many Indians said, the artificial gathering evolved into a traditional one, bringing together disparate tribes from the Northwest. Many said they loved sharing the tradition with their children. More than 300 teepees were set up this year, a larger number than organizers could remember.
''We could be clear up in the mountains and we'd have to get back to the reservation to get ready for Round-Up,'' recalled Jesse Jones Jr., chief of the Cayuse tribe. ''But it's not a place to get rich. My mother stressed that to us. It's about tradition.''
For all the complaints about the Indian seating, some Indians said they did not mind, particularly since the seats were free, compared with $20 for those in the shade. Mr. Culham noted that Round-Up is run largely by 1,500 volunteers, many of whom are given vouchers to buy meals in return for their service, but not free seats.
Speaking of the Native Americans, he said, ''They get a special section to sit in plus they get access to the Round-Up grounds like the volunteers do.''
But volunteers do not bring their children and grandparents out to the rodeo in traditional dress, make their way on horseback and on foot from the Teepee Village to the historic arena, smiling and waving and singing and dancing.
Before the procession this year, Wayne Brooks, the rodeo announcer, called local Indians ''our friends, our family'' and during the procession he handed over the microphone to Jess Nowland, who spoke for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla.
''We're all glad to welcome all of you here to our homeland,'' Mr. Nowland said.
Mr. Nowland described the tribes' long history here on the Columbia River plateau, how they had ''ceded'' much of their land to white settlers but were now striving to improve tribal social and economic health through projects as varied as improving salmon habitat and the steadily expanding Wildhorse Resort and Casino, which opened in 1995.
It was then that a man in the crowd called out, ''To suck us all dry! So we can spend all our money there.''
Not everyone heard the heckler. Most people were polite and took pictures. The casino is now a sponsor of the Round-Up. Soon enough, out came the water truck to wet down the dirt so the rodeo could resume.
''This,'' Mr. Brooks said, ''concludes the Indian portion of our show.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Home Sales in August Matched Modest Forecasts

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Home sales stabilized in August after a deep tumble in July, a development that, in the context of a severely troubled housing market, counts as good news.
Sales of existing homes rose 7.6 percent last month from July's miserable levels but were still the second weakest since 1997, the National Association of Realtors said. Sales were down 19 percent from August 2009. 
The results matched analysts' expectations, which were modest. ''It's not much to write home about,'' Michael D. Larson of Weiss Research said.
On a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, August sales were 4.13 million, up from 3.84 million in July. In a typical year before the boom, more than five million existing homes were sold.
Few analysts anticipated the carnage in July, when sales fell 27 percent from June. A tax credit that propped up the market last winter but expired in the spring took most of the blame.
Even the lowest interest rates in 50 years, prompted by the government's large-scale buying of mortgage-backed securities, could not make much headway. The rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage slid as low as 4.32 percent this month.
Between the low rates and the 30 percent decline in prices from the peak, monthly mortgage payments are about half what they were at the peak of the boom. Then no one wanted to wait to buy; now potential buyers have infinite patience.
Sales over the next few months are likely to remain subdued. Weekly applications for new mortgages show little growth but little decline either.
''There is still some demand out there,'' Jennifer H. Lee of BMO Capital Markets said in a research note, ''just not a heck of a lot.''
Housing is on its own these days. The government is unlikely to add to its panoply of foreclosure relief plans, and interest rates do not appear likely to fall further. A rebound will depend on a pickup in employment and the formation of new households, both of which keep receding into the future.
Slumping sales will undermine prices as sellers compete to find buyers. Some indexes are already starting to fall again. The Federal Housing Finance Agency reported this week that its home price index dropped 0.5 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in July from June. The index is down 3.3 percent over the last year.
Moody's Analytics lowered its expectation for prices last week, saying they will drop 8 percent more. Previously, Moody's forecast a 5 percent drop. It also postponed the date for the market bottom from the first quarter of 2011 to the third quarter.
The supply of homes on the market, whether from banks or households, will weigh heavily on prices. While inventories declined slightly in August, they are still at an elevated level.
It takes about a year to sell a house, the Realtors' group said. That is more than double the time in a healthy economy. If the number of foreclosures on the market continues to rise, inventories will swell considerably.

HEADLINE: Calling Paladino a 'Welfare King'

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
This 30-second television advertisement -- titled ''One Job?'' -- is the third for Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, in his campaign for governor of New York. His Republican challenger is Carl P. Paladino, a Buffalo businessman and developer. The Cuomo campaign declined to specify where the advertisement would run, on what channels or at what cost. 
PRODUCER Murphy Putnam
THE SCRIPT ''Who is Carl Paladino? A landlord and developer who has given politicians almost a half-million dollars and gets insider deals from Albany. Carl Paladino got a $1.4 million Empire Zone tax break to create jobs. But his official filings show only one job was created. A $1.4 million tax break for one job? Carl Paladino: a welfare king who got rich by milking New York taxpayers. Carl Paladino isn't part of the solution in Albany. He's part of the problem.''
ON THE SCREEN The advertisement opens, as negative ones usually do, with a picture of the target looking his worst: scowling, furtive and raccoon-eyed. Over a soundtrack of ominous music, the picture moves to the side of the screen as facts swoop in to back up the script, including the figure $452,000 -- a reference to Mr. Paladino's total campaign donations to politicians -- and a picture of a state form on which businesses apply for the tax credits. The picture then pivots to a close-up of an article in The Daily News, spotlighting a description of Mr. Paladino as a ''welfare king.''
ACCURACY Mr. Paladino's campaign does not dispute his history of political giving, the size of the tax break or the job creation reported to state officials. But it argues that the rules for such reporting undervalue the economic impact of Mr. Paladino's developments, especially those that house retail stores.
SCORECARD As negative ads go, this one is somewhat mild, especially when compared with the blustery rhetoric and sometimes cartoonish nicknames Mr. Paladino has hurled in Mr. Cuomo's direction. It quickly captures a tension inherent in the candidacy of Mr. Paladino, who is running as a pitchfork-wielding anti-Albany outsider but is also a multimillionaire, a longtime political donor and a prominent businessman who has earned substantial amounts from government contracts.

HEADLINE: Top Executives Say It Pays to Spend Time in Asia

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Many Western companies have operated blue-collar manufacturing sites in Asia for a long time. Now, as the region grows in importance, the most senior white collars of some of those companies are spending more time here than ever before.
Kasper Rorsted -- leading the German corporate giant Henkel, the maker of Loctite glue and Persil detergent -- just spent nearly six weeks working in Asia, an unusually long time for a chief executive to be away from headquarters. 
''You get a very good feel for what's going on in the region,'' Mr. Rorsted said by phone from Shanghai this month before heading back to Dusseldorf. His trip spanned nine countries and involved nearly 100 meetings. ''You get a lot of appreciation from the customers when you take the time to meet them here,'' he said, and you ''send a very important signal to your own organization about the importance of the region.''
Mr. Rorsted's visit is a reflection of the critical role that Asia now plays for many Western countries. Henkel makes 14 percent of its sales and 20 percent of its profit in the Asia-Pacific region. About 18 percent of its 48,133 employees are based in the region, but Mr. Rorsted expects a third of the company's staff to be located there in a few years.
While other parts of the world are struggling to regain momentum after the turmoil of the last few years, most of the Asia-Pacific region -- outside Japan -- is enjoying rapid economic expansion. The populations of developing Asian countries are growing and becoming more affluent and better educated.
As a result, the region has become not just an important destination for Western-made products but an increasingly important location of product development prowess and local business partners.
At Cisco Systems, the network equipment giant, what started as a research and development center in the Indian city of Bangalore now has the status of a second headquarters. Since 2007, many top-level managers have moved to Bangalore from San Jose, Calif., as the company seeks to position itself better for the immense changes taking place in emerging Asia. Cisco does not publish a breakdown of profit by region.
In 2007, the Dutch software company Irdeto split its headquarters between Amsterdam and Beijing. Its chief executive, Graham Kill, moved to Beijing, and the company's development and back-office functions are now in both cities.
The trend of senior executives spending more hours in Asia is in its early stages. But such moves go way past outsourcing, and far beyond beefing up the lower ranks of a company's work force with hires in Hong Kong, Singapore or Shanghai.
''It's not about costs and cheap labor. It's about how can we get access to talent, how can we get access to growth and innovations, and how can we get access to new partners,'' Wim Elfrink, chief globalization officer at Cisco, said in a telephone interview from Bangalore. ''The demographic shifts and the massive process of urbanization here mean the region is going through a tremendous transition -- and to be part of that, and to really understand it, you have to be here.''
Companies are also holding board meetings with increasing frequency in Asia.
The Swiss bank Julius Baer held a board meeting in Singapore for the first time this month. One of Julius Baer's executive board members moved to Singapore last year, and its chief executive plans to spend one month a year in the city beginning next year, in addition to frequent shorter visits.
Some experts contend that executives at many companies may still not be spending enough time in Asia.
A recent report by McKinsey & Company said multinational companies often devoted less top management time to China -- for many the most critical market within Asia -- than they perhaps should.
''Senior executive time spent in China and knowledge of Chinese customers are no less important than more straightforward metrics about market share in China or sourcing volumes,'' the report's authors wrote.
''Many of our clients are way beyond the market-entry stage; all of them think they know China,'' said Martin Hirt, who heads up McKinsey's Asia strategy practice, by phone from Taipei. ''But how much time do senior execs actually spend in China? Is the C.E.O. trying to become part of the community there, is he on the ground, networking?''
Those who do spend large amounts of time here say their insights give them and their companies a totally different perspective and appreciation of the profound and rapid changes taking place in the region.
Mr. Kill said his company's dual-headquarters structure had significantly improved productivity and internal communication and had been instrumental in securing contracts and improving customer loyalty.
''You have to live it and breathe it, otherwise you don't feel it, you don't intellectually understand it,'' said Mr. Elfrink of Cisco. ''When I was based in California, topics relating to Asia may have been priorities No. 8 or 9 for me. Now, they are top of my list, and I can help move them up the company's priority list.''
He added, ''I think what we're seeing is the start of a whole new phase of globalization.'' After changes in trade, manufacturing, and research and development, ''the next phase of globalization will be the decentralization of headquarters functions,'' he said.
One of Mr. Rorsted's many gatherings this summer was a two-and-a-half-hour event in Shanghai with about 1,100 of his staff.
Videoconferencing and phones can do a lot of things, said Mr. Rorsted, who plans to spend another stint in Asia for several weeks next year. ''But you can't replace presence and personal contact with technology,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Small Gifts Sent to Ease U.S. Debt

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
PARKERSBURG, W.Va. -- In a fifth-floor cubicle in a federal office building here is a wire-frame basket labeled ''Gifts.''
Every few days, an envelope arrives, and a Treasury Department employee opens it. Inside, usually, is a check, often with a letter explaining why the sender wants to do his or her part to help reduce the federal debt of the United States.
A very small part, to be sure. 
Last year, the Bureau of the Public Debt recorded $3.1 million in gifts, more than has been usual since the government began accepting such donations in 1961. At that rate, it would take millions of years to retire the $13.4 trillion the country owes its creditors, foreign and domestic.
While concerns about the economy, especially taxes and spending, have dominated the midterm election, it is hard to find officials who have made voluntary contributions to improve the nation's balance sheet.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has not pulled out his checkbook, and fiscal conservatives, for whom the record debt is a rallying cry, have hardly mentioned the idea of giving.
Since the program began, Americans have given about $80 million. Recent donors include a class of Alabama sixth graders who raised $324.50 by selling cookies; a Maryland man who learned of the program in an evening accounting class; and Margaret E. Taylor, 98, of Findlay, Ohio, who died in 2006 and bequeathed $1.1 million to the cause.
''I get mixed reactions,'' said John W. Krupansky, 56, a software developer in Midtown Manhattan who started reading about economics during the dot-com crash a decade ago, and has blogged about his tax deductible gifts, nine so far, of $25 each. ''Some people are annoyed; they think the right thing to do is complain about the debt, not actually do something about it. Other people are amused that anyone would waste their time to do such a thing.''
This fiscal year, through July, the bureau has logged $2.7 million, about 9 percent less than at the same point last year.
Donors can send in a check or money order, or give online using a credit or debit card. The government does not advertise the program, and officials avoid drawing attention to it. The program tends to come up, they said, only when journalists ask about it.
Van Zeck, the commissioner of the bureau, oversees sales of Treasury securities and savings bonds; accounts for the debt to the penny; and ensures that the debt does not exceed the statutory limit, which Congress raised in February to $14.3 trillion.
Asked why the program was little known, he said soliciting donations might ''seem straightforward and benign'' but could rub taxpayers the wrong way.
''Whether to advocate that people do more financially to help the government than they already do -- that's not the kind of question that's mine to answer,'' he said.
The program was the idea of Representative Charles E. Bennett, a Florida Democrat who served 44 years in the House. Mr. Bennett, who died in 2003 at age 92, also wrote the law requiring that currency bear the motto ''In God We Trust.''
He was known for public spiritedness. A World War II veteran, he returned his military disability and Social Security checks to the government. When he retired, he gave most of his campaign funds to charity and the Treasury.
Mr. Bennett's law helped clarify the government's authority to accept gifts dedicated to debt reduction.
While the White House believed that ''such authority almost certainly already exists,'' the legislation was ''intended to encourage such gifts'' and to create a way to accept them, according to a 1961 memorandum, now in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.
But although the memorandum confirms that the gifts are counted toward debt reduction, the amount of giving has no real impact on government spending and borrowing.
''There does not appear to be any intention to put control of the actual level of the debt in private hands, although those who make such gifts may be under the impression that they are exercising such control,'' Phillip S. Hughes, an assistant budget director, wrote in advising President Kennedy to sign the bill.
For some people, that makes the program toothless.
''It's just good money after bad,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, who with Senator John McCain, a fellow Arizona Republican, has introduced legislation that would let taxpayers designate up to 10 percent of their federal income tax for debt reduction and require Congress to come up with an equal amount in spending cuts.
Mr. Flake said he had only a ''vague recollection'' of the gifts program, but that he did not support it. ''I don't think taxpayers should be on the hook more,'' he said. ''We already pay enough.''
But contributors have argued that shared sacrifice is what is most needed to revive the economy.
Teri Gisi, a teacher at Dalraida Elementary School in Montgomery, Ala., who coordinated the bake sale that sixth graders held last year after learning about the debt in class, said the recession was on their minds.
''We've had some students who've had to move in with their grandparents, students who've lost their homes to foreclosure,'' she said. ''Some of them didn't even have new shoes for the start of school.''
Despite hardships, the students made debt reduction their cause. ''Three hundred dollars to them is a large amount,'' Ms. Gisi said. Even when a math teacher explained how large the debt was -- ''he showed them all the zeros,'' she said -- ''they didn't get discouraged.''
Treasury officials said they were prohibited from identifying donors. But in Parkersburg, a few employees shared stories.
A widow turned over the estate of her late husband, who had made regular gifts to express patriotism. Naturalized citizens, thankful for the opportunities afforded immigrants, have contributed. A man sent in a trove of rare coins, which were auctioned for far more than their face value.
Many taxpayers have simply signed over and mailed in their rebate checks, including members of Amish and Mennonite communities who have explained that their religious beliefs do not permit them to accept government assistance.
The bureau tries to make donors feel appreciated. Anyone who mails a check receives a thank-you form letter from Sherlyn West, a manager here.
''Your contribution will help ensure that we do not burden future generations with a huge debt,'' it says.

LENGTH: 1004 words

HEADLINE: Students Caught in the School Squeeze

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''One of the saddest days of my life was when my mother told me 'Superman' did not exist,'' the educational reformer Geoffrey Canada recalls in the opening moments of ''Waiting for 'Superman,' '' a powerful and alarming documentary about America's failing public school system. ''She thought I was crying because it's like Santa Claus is not real. I was crying because no one was coming with enough power to save us.''
If Mr. Canada, who was born in the South Bronx and grew up to be one of the country's most charismatic and inspiring educators, is not Superman, he must be a close relative. Those who have read Paul Tough's book, ''Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America,'' will know that the 97-block Harlem Children's Zone, which he founded and runs, is no miracle. The zone is astoundingly successful at getting children through high school and into college. But that success, largely dependent on private money, is a costly product of laborious trial and error. 
Mr. Canada and Michelle A. Rhee, the chancellor of the Washington, D.C., public school system since 2007 (she is the seventh superintendent in 10 years), are the principal heroes of the film, directed and narrated by Davis Guggenheim (''An Inconvenient Truth''), who wrote it with Billy Kimball.
Ms. Rhee, who has stridently challenged Washington's educational status quo, has closed ineffective schools and has stood up to the unions that have made it nearly impossible to fire a teacher, no matter how incompetent, once tenure has been granted. But the Washington Teachers' Union refused to vote on a measure under which teachers would give up tenure in exchange for higher salaries based on merit. (Ms. Rhee's status is now in jeopardy after one of her chief supporters, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, lost the Democratic primary election to Vincent C. Gray, the chairman of the City Council. Ms. Rhee and Mr. Gray, who have sparred in recent years, met on Thursday.)
''Waiting for 'Superman' '' is filled with disturbing statistics. In Illinois, where one in 57 doctors loses his medical license and one in 97 lawyers loses his law license, only one in 2,500 teachers loses his credentials, because of union rules. The film briefly visits a ''rubber room'' in New York City where idle teachers accused of misconduct wait months and sometimes years for hearings while drawing full salaries at an annual cost of $65 million.
The resistance to change is personified by Randi Weingarten, the fiery and articulate former head of the United Federation of Teachers, who now runs the American Federation of Teachers. Ms. Weingarten, who is somewhat demonized by the film, is the first to admit that public education is in crisis, but she represents thousands of teachers who depend on tenure.
Caught in the squeeze are students. The film's most emotional moments revolve around five children whose futures depend on winning a lottery to a charter school. Anthony, a Washington fifth grader raised by his grandmother in a bad neighborhood, is among 64 applicants for 24 spots at the Seed School, a public charter school from which 9 out of 10 students go on to college. Francisco, a Bronx first grader, is among 792 applicants for 40 spots at the Harlem Success Academy. Applying to the same school, Bianca, a kindergartner, is one of 767 children competing for 35 spots. Daisy, a fifth grader in East Los Angeles who dreams of being doctor, is among 135 applicants for 10 spots at Kipp LA Prep.
Finally, there is Emily, an eighth grader in Silicon Valley, whose problems with math will place her on a lower academic track if she remains at the same high school in her affluent community. Her best hope is to be accepted at an even better charter school nearby where students aren't placed in such tracks.
In his low-key narration, Mr. Guggenheim acknowledges that charter schools have had mixed success in elevating academic standards and preparing children for college. But in the Harlem Children's Zone, the schools become involved with all aspects of the students' lives from a very young age.
Mr. Guggenheim calls dysfunctional schools ''dropout factories.'' For children growing up in poor neighborhoods where parents lack the resources to send them to private schools, the consequences can be dire, not to mention economically wasteful.
Consider the following statistics cited in the film: the annual cost of prison for an inmate is more than double what is spent on an individual public school student. Eight years after Congress passed the No Child Left Behind act, with the goal of 100 percent proficiency in math and reading, most states hovered between 20 and 30 percent proficiency, and 70 percent of eighth graders could not read at grade level. By 2020, only an estimated 50 million Americans will be qualified to fill 123 million highly skilled, highly paid jobs. Among 30 developed countries, the United States ranks 25th in math and 21st in science.
''Waiting for 'Superman' '' doesn't explore the deeper changes in American society that have led to this crisis: the widening gap between rich and poor, the loosening of the social contract, the coarsening of the culture and the despair of the underclass. By showing how fiercely dedicated idealists are making a difference, it is a call to arms.
The movie's happy-sad ending observes the moment of decision as the five children wait to learn if they have won the lotteries. It is sad that the direction of a young life depends on the dropping of a numbered ball from plexiglass box.
''Waiting for 'Superman' '' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has mild language and incidental smoking.
Waiting for 'Superman'
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
Directed by Davis Guggenheim; written by Mr. Guggenheim and Billy Kimball; director of photography, Erich Roland and Bob Richman; edited by Greg Finton, Jay Cassidy and Kim Roberts; original song ''Shine'' by John Legend; produced by Lesley Chilcott; released by Para- mount Vantage. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopefuls in California on Different Paths

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Both are former corporate chief executives, with personal fortunes, impressive resumes and famous friends. Both are conservatives who say that they have lived the American dream and fear for its future. And both are Bay Area women, with their eyes and ambitions firmly fixed on a change of address.
But beyond those surface similarities, the Republican candidates for California governor and United States senator, Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina, are charging into the general election with very different political personas and campaign strategies.
Ms. Whitman, a billionaire who has poured more than $100 million of her own fortune into her campaign, has defined herself as an on-message spokeswoman for what she calls a three-part plan to fix California. Ms. Fiorina, meanwhile, has emerged as a fiery, combative saleswoman for this year's brand of anti-incumbent anger. 
''They're trying to ride the same wave, but they're riding it a little bit different,'' said Jack Citrin, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. ''It's like Fiorina is on a surfboard, and Whitman is on her yacht.''
Polls show both races are essentially dead heats. But Ms. Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay who breezed to the Republican nomination for governor, has steadily moved toward the center in her race against the Democrat Jerry Brown, experts say, voicing her support for abortion rights and refusing to back a ballot measure that would suspend California's landmark environmental law, AB 32.
Ms. Fiorina, who faced a tougher primary challenge but won comfortably, has stayed to the right, in what some political analysts see as a sustained effort to galvanize the conservative base against her opponent, Senator Barbara Boxer, a liberal stalwart whom she calls an ''antiwar ideologue'' beholden to ''extreme environmentalists.''
At a rally outside Fresno, in the conservative Central Valley, Ms. Fiorina paced and pointed her way through an impassioned stump speech, imploring members of the ''brave Tea Party'' to support her, bragging about her husband's gun collection, and joking about ''that other world, called San Francisco.'' (That she lives in Los Altos Hills, a well-to-do Bay Area suburb, seems beside the point.)
''We're all members of one party now: the Had Enough Party,'' Ms. Fiorina told a feisty 250-person crowd, some wearing red Tea Party Patriot T-shirts. ''We've had enough of a government that's out of control.''
Their campaigns say the two candidates are friends and have attended private fund-raisers together. But Ms. Fiorina's sharp elbows have occasionally winged her party mate, as they did in June when Ms. Fiorina was captured on an open microphone calling one of Ms. Whitman's campaign decisions ''bizarre'' and ''very bad.''
The two women have rarely appeared side by side during the campaign, though both spoke at the California Republican Party's convention last month. And while Ms. Fiorina was a top economic adviser to Senator John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign, Ms. Whitman's early choice was Mitt Romney.
A victory for either Ms. Whitman or Ms. Fiorina, neither of whom has run for public office before, would be a milestone. Ms. Whitman would be the state's first female governor. The race between Ms. Fiorina and Ms. Boxer, meanwhile, is the first time that two women have competed for a California Senate seat, and Ms. Fiorina would be the first Republican woman to be a senator from California.
While Democrats hold a large advantage in registered -- and female -- voters in the state, the election for governor could come down to whether women decide to cross party lines to make history, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll. ''That's the most interesting question to be answered,'' he said.
At what was billed as a ''women's town hall'' last week at a factory in Anaheim, Ms. Whitman preached her mantra of free enterprise, personal responsibility and fiscal discipline, ideas that she said working women knew all too well.
''The next governor needs to know exactly what she believes,'' said Ms. Whitman, who established a campaign group, MegaWomen, to court female voters and volunteers. ''And she needs to stick with it.''
Ms. Fiorina has also been emphasizing her gender, but in different ways, using her personal narrative, including a battle with breast cancer and an early stint as a receptionist, to rally female voters.
''Fiorina has an advantage which Whitman doesn't, which is a very compelling human interest story,'' said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ''Meg doesn't really have a Horatio Alger story to tell.''
Ms. Fiorina, of course, is not impoverished, having accepted a $21 million severance from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2005. But Ms. Whitman's fortune is so vast, and her contributions to her own campaign so immense, that she has taken to addressing the issue on the trail, saying it will help her be independent.
''Because I'm spending a lot of my own money this campaign,'' she said in Anaheim, ''I do not owe anything to anybody.''
Some of the distinctions between the candidates come down to the offices they seek and the opponents they face. Mr. Whalen said that California voters tend to vote for ''hybrid'' governors -- neither staunch liberals nor hard-line conservatives -- in part because a fifth of the state's electorate is made up of ''decline to state'' voters, who often are fiscally cautious and socially liberal.
''What we see in the Whitman campaign is that they've decided that the safest way to go is to be absolutely centrist,'' Mr. Whalen said, describing her campaign as ''a big tank rolling right down the middle of the street.''
Ms. Fiorina's campaign, he said, seems ''much more interested in how the national breezes are blowing, and those breezes are anti-incumbent and antipolitical,'' two elements that fan the flames against Ms. Boxer, long a pariah to many conservative voters.
''Carly is intense, and that's what Republicans have been have been looking for a long time,'' Mr. Whalen said. ''Someone to stand up to Boxer.''
In Clovis, outside Fresno, Ms. Fiorina showed some of that fire, attacking Ms. Boxer as favoring environmental protections at the expense of the state's farmers, and saying that her defeat would send ''a shot heard right across this nation.''
''What has she done for this state and this community? Nothing,'' Ms. Fiorina said.
Later, during a question-and-answer session, Ms. Fiorina voiced her personal support for offshore drilling as well as Proposition 23, which would suspend a 2006 law intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions. And when asked by a gun owner whether she supported the death penalty, she said yes, adding that sometimes you had to ''give people the punishments they deserve.''
And by the way, she added, ''my husband owns a lot of guns.'' The crowd cheered.
That kind of fare was much less on the menu Tuesday night in Burlingame, just south of San Francisco, where Ms. Whitman appeared alongside Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state who has also endorsed Ms. Fiorina, at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser.
Ms. Whitman, surrounded by a crowd of some 350 well-dressed supporters, began by saying she enjoyed ''being here in my hometown'' and was ''delighted to see so many friends,'' many of whom seemed enthusiastic about her pledge to ''turn the Golden State golden again.''
''We will make California a place where your children, your grandchildren and nieces and nephews can stay,'' she said. ''And prosper much as you have.''

HEADLINE: Seeking To Protect Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
''We are the investor's advocate.''
-- William O. Douglas, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 1937
We ask regulators to make things better. Or at least not to make them worse.
But over the last decade, the Securities and Exchange Commission failed badly when it came to requiring stock markets to treat individual investors fairly. Markets that worked for such investors were replaced by ones that could not care less about them.
As Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairman, put it, in the old system ''the market participants with the best access to the markets'' -- New York Stock Exchange specialists and Nasdaq market makers -- ''were subject to significant trading obligations that were designed to promote fair and orderly markets and fair treatment of investors.''
''These traditional obligations,'' she added in a speech to the Economic Club of New York this month, ''have fallen by the wayside.'' 
The S.E.C. stood by as newer electronic markets evolved and came to dominate trading. The traders with the best access now have few if any obligations to investors.
Most of the time the new structure works well. But when it does not, individual investors can be the losers because markets cheat them in ways that would have been unthinkable -- and probably illegal -- only a few years ago.
Now the commission is trying to recover. This week the nation's stock markets proposed new rules -- rules that were agreed to after heavy pressure from the S.E.C. -- to force market makers to stop posting ridiculous ''stub'' quotes. These days, such quotes are put up by market makers that are required to post quotes but do not really want to buy or sell shares. Those rules will do a little. But not much.
No longer will a market maker for a $100 stock be able to post a bid of one cent and an asked price of $1,000, as has become common and led to the spectacle of Accenture trading for one penny on May 6, the day of the ''flash crash.''
But market makers will still be able to post quotes that are clearly intended to avoid making a market. If that stock is not issued by a major company, the posted quote could be $70 bid, $130 asked. For companies in the Russell 1,000 -- the largest companies in the United States by market value -- the quote would have to be narrower, within 8 percent of the market price. That works into $92 bid, $108 asked.
And the quote can be for only 100 shares.
There are two principal advantages to being a registered market maker on an exchange. The first is that capital requirements are eased. The second is that such firms can avoid buy-ins -- where they are forced to buy stock that they did not deliver when they sold it -- for a few days longer than other firms.
There are no real obligations for the role, however, at least in some markets. Instead, it is assumed that liquidity will be provided by traders with fast computers. Most of the time it is. But those traders can withdraw from the market whenever they choose to do so.
They did that on May 6. For some stocks, the only bid left was a stub quote of one cent, and the computers executed at that price. The sellers were unfortunates who had put in orders to sell at the market price -- assuming wrongly that the market would function. Other losers were those who had put in stop-loss orders to sell if a stock fell below a specified price.
In the aftermath, officials canceled trades made at prices at least 60 percent below the previous day's closing price. But if you sold for half what the share was worth in a real market, you were out of luck.
No such trades happened at the New York Stock Exchange, which had rules to slow down trading and let someone with a brain look first when trading got out of hand. Much of Wall Street wanted the S.E.C. to penalize the Big Board for slowing things down, which they thought was unconscionable in a modern world where trades should be executed within milliseconds of being sent to a market.
The exchanges have new rules aimed at providing more certainty about which trades would be canceled if another flash crash occurs. But in some cases, there is still no way to be sure. And any such rules have to be arbitrary.
There are more rules coming. Ms. Schapiro, in a speech to stock traders in New York this week, said the commission was considering requiring the so-called high frequency traders to take on obligations not unlike those that specialists used to have.
One idea that has gotten some consideration is to require market makers to make markets, even if they don't want to do so, and in return to allow them to cancel orders in milliseconds, as high frequency traders do now. Others would have to wait -- for less than a second -- before canceling orders.
But the commission is worried about unintended consequences from well-intentioned rules, and that fear may limit how bold any new rules are.
''For example,'' Ms. Schapiro said, ''imposing significant obligations for market quality on some firms, but leaving other firms free to operate without those obligations -- or, indeed, to take advantage of the firms with obligations -- would create an unfair playing field that might, in the end, do little to promote market quality.''
We must devise requirements carefully and be wary of imposing disproportionate obligations that -- while attractive in theory -- could, in practice, drive liquidity out of the market altogether.
A decade ago, such a proposal would have seemed odd, simply because those obligations already existed for market makers and specialists. Another idea from Ms. Schapiro -- that ways should be found to make more trades public immediately -- would have seemed equally curious. Virtually all trades were already disclosed.
Now, however, there are ''dark pools'' whose bids and offers are not exposed to the entire market, and some institutions swear they need them to be sure others do not figure out their trading strategies. And there are brokerage firms that ''internalize'' orders and do not let the rest of us in on what they are doing as they match buyers and sellers.
''They now execute nearly 30 percent of volume,'' Ms. Schapiro said of the internalizers and dark pools. ''What is the effect of these venues on public price discovery and market stability?
More transparency is needed, and it will take rules to accomplish that. But some of the other rules being considered might not be necessary if the S.E.C. took what might be called a ''principles-based approach.''
The commission could simply announce that if orders from retail investors and small institutions are filled at ridiculous prices -- defined as prices not consistent with the real market absent flash-crash craziness -- it is the responsibility of the broker that handed the order to make the customer whole.
Then the brokers will have an incentive to send orders only to markets that will prevent such ridiculous trades from taking place. The markets might choose to indemnify brokers for their obligations to customers if the market does malfunction. If not, brokers might choose other markets.
A decade ago, there was an obligation for ''best execution'' of orders. It is clear that the victims of the flash crash got anything but that. Simply renewing that obligation may go a long way to fixing what is broken.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Delay A Vote on Bush Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats said Thursday that they would postpone a highly contentious floor fight over what to do about the expiring Bush-era tax cuts until after the November elections, a decision that spares some politically vulnerable incumbents from casting a potentially difficult vote to let taxes rise for the rich.
Democrats said they would still fight to end the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans when they return for a lame-duck session. But the delay increases the likelihood of a compromise with Republicans who have insisted that the lower rates continue for everyone, at least temporarily, given the weak economy. 
It also raised a political risk for Democrats that they would be seen as wavering on one of President Obama's signature campaign promises and abandoning a fight that could have mobilized the party's base ahead of the elections.
A number of Democrats in the Senate and in the House have also called for a temporary extension of the tax breaks at all income levels and that was clearly a factor in the decision by party leaders to hold off.
Still, the Democrats sought to put the blame for the delay squarely on Republicans, accusing them of holding tax relief for the middle class ''hostage'' to insist on tax cuts for millionaires.
''Democrats believe we must permanently extend tax cuts for the middle class before they expire at the end of the year, and we will,'' said Jim Manley, a spokesman for the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada. ''Unfortunately, to this point we have received no cooperation from Republicans to do so.'' Mr. Manley added, ''We will come back in November and stay in session as long as it takes to get this done.''
But Republicans said the accusations of obstruction were ridiculous given that Democrats had not even tried to bring legislation to the floor to extend the tax cuts.
''It's odd to complain about a lack of cooperation on a bill that doesn't exist,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
In a statement, Mr. Stewart noted that Mr. McConnell had introduced a bill called the ''Tax Hike Prevention Act,'' and he said, ''We hope Democrats, who have yet to actually introduce tax legislation to prevent tax hikes, won't hold it hostage to their burning desire to raise taxes on small businesses and families in the middle of a recession.''
While a federal panel recently declared that the recession had officially ended, Mr. McConnell and other Republicans have said the economy is still too weak to allow any increase in taxes.
The decision by Senate Democrats to postpone the floor debate came after weeks of intense strategic deliberations with the House and the White House. And the final determination, announced by Mr. Reid's office, came after Senate Democrats met one last time to discuss the matter over lunch on Thursday.
House Democrats had long ago signaled that they had no desire to take up the tax issue before the Senate given the high likelihood that Senate Republicans would be able to block any bill that did not extend all of the tax breaks.
There are more vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the House than in the Senate, and many of them had no interest in casting a vote that opponents could use to paint them either as increasing taxes in a weak economy or abandoning President Obama and Democratic Congressional leaders.
Mr. Obama, when he ran for president, promised to end the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy but make them permanent for couples earning up to $250,000 a year and individuals earning up to $200,000, in the first year of his presidency. But he delayed his plans because of the recession.
Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, joined in the finger-pointing at Republicans and said they were blocking tax relief for the middle class. She warned that the White House would continue to use the issue during the campaign. ''The American people will be reminded of that every day,'' Ms. Brundage said.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Fail to Advance a Campaign Finance Bill, an Obama Priority

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats failed Thursday to advance campaign finance legislation that would force businesses, unions and others to disclose how they were spending money in political campaigns and where they were getting it.
The vote was a defeat for President Obama on one of his top legislative priorities. For months, Mr. Obama has urged Congress to undo the damage he said was caused last January by a Supreme Court decision on campaign finance, saying the failure to act would herald ''the corporate takeover of our democracy.''
But Republicans would not budge, blocking the bill from even coming to a vote and accusing Democrats of ignoring bigger problems. 
The president fared better on a separate matter, as the House approved and sent to Mr. Obama for his signature a Democratic plan to aid small businesses. By a vote of 237 to 187, the House passed legislation that would create a $30 billion loan fund for small businesses and provide other tax incentives to encourage hiring and stimulate growth. On the measure, 236 Democrats and one Republican voted yes while 174 Republicans and 13 Democrats opposed the bill.
Mr. Obama said in a statement that he would sign the small-business bill on Monday, calling it ''a common-sense plan to put Americans back to work.''
But his hopes for signing legislation on campaign finance before the November elections quickly evaporated Thursday afternoon on the Senate floor. With no Republicans voting to cut off debate, the vote was 59 to 39 -- one short of what the measure's supporters needed. The House had approved the measure on a party-line vote in June.
The measure would have forced companies, unions, special-interest groups and other organizations active in political campaigning to disclose in federal filings their donors of more than $1,000 and to require the head of an organization that paid for a political commercial to appear on camera to say, ''I approved this message,'' just as candidates themselves now do.
It would also prevent government contractors, businesses that received federal bailout money and foreign corporations from spending on campaigns.
Democrats maintained that with a recent surge in money from outside groups that do not have to disclose their donors, the bill was essential to maintaining some transparency in the political process and neutralizing the impact of big businesses.
But Republicans asserted that it went too far. Republicans had also succeeded in July in blocking a vote in the Senate, but Democrats held out some hope that they could sway one or two moderate Republicans by making concessions this week. Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who authored the bill, offered to pare down the measure and to ensure that it would not be enacted until after the November elections to appease Republicans who asserted that the measure could be used to help Democrats gain re-election.
Republicans, however, would not relent.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, said Democrats should be focusing on issues that Americans really care about -- especially jobs and the economy -- instead of wasting two days of debate on a measure that he asserted would mean ''more government control'' over political finance.
Liberals pushing for changes in campaign finance did take some solace, however, in a separate vote in a House committee to provide some public financing for Congressional candidates.
''It was a 'you win some, you lose some' day for campaign finance,'' Lisa Gilbert, who tracks political finance issues for U.S. PIRG, a federation of public interest groups.
The House committee on administration voted to approve a bill that would provide matching federal money for Congressional candidates who attract enough small local donors. The financing -- potentially hundreds of millions of dollars -- would come from the sale of broadcast spectrum and would not require any additional taxpayer money, sponsors say.
Republicans quickly signaled that they would fight this bill as well. Mr. McConnell, in fact, linked the two measures in voicing his opposition and questioning the priorities of Democrats who support public financing.
''Have they no shame?'' Mr. McConnell asked. ''The last thing the American people want right now is what amounts to welfare for politicians.''

HEADLINE: Legislative Plan Direct From G.O.P. Mainstream

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the legislative blueprint that Republicans hope will serve as a roadmap to winning control of the House, they declared their two highest priorities to be creating jobs and stopping ''out-of-control spending'' by the federal government.
''To create jobs, we need to end the uncertainty for job creators and the spending spree in Washington,'' the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said on Thursday at a hardware store in Sterling, Va., where the party unveiled its agenda.
The approach Mr. Boehner set out is based on a belief that smaller government, lower taxes and less regulation will fuel economic growth, create jobs and ultimately lead to a more prosperous nation. It deviated little from the tenets of mainstream conservatism over the last generation.
But even conservative-leaning budget and policy analysts said that the Republican blueprint, as drafted, would lead to bigger, not smaller, deficits and that it did not contain the concrete, politically difficult steps needed to alter the nation's fiscal trajectory. 
In the agenda, Republicans said they would extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts, which would add roughly $4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. They also proposed a new tax break for small businesses at a cost of $25 billion over the next two years.
And while they called for quickly slashing about $100 billion in ''nonsecurity'' discretionary spending, they did not specify how those cuts would be carried out. Moreover, experts said such reductions would not change the long-term budgetary picture.
''I wouldn't call this a deficit reduction plan,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonprofit group that advocates fiscal responsibility.
''It's a net increase in the deficit, because extending all of the tax cuts is a huge hit on the deficit, and they are not making anywhere near the magnitude of the spending cuts you would need to justify extending those tax cuts on a permanent basis.''
Critics noted that the Republican plan pointedly excluded military and other security programs from budget cuts -- even though Pentagon spending has soared in recent years -- and that the plan even called for added spending on missile defense.
In addition, the House Republicans said that repealing the Democrats' health care law would be the centerpiece of their agenda. But they also indicated they would retain popular provisions that would probably lead to a big increase in health care costs.
Some fiscal hawks criticized the Republican plan, saying that it ducked an opportunity to firmly commit to changing the wasteful ways of Washington, by promising legislation that would mandate a balanced budget or limits on spending.
''The deficit is $1.3 trillion and the total budget is $3.6 trillion, so $100 billion, as huge as it sounds, doesn't really change the trajectory that much,'' said David Boaz, executive vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, a Washington research group.
''They are continuing the problem that I think everybody in Washington, including Democrats, understands,'' Mr. Boaz said. ''Our fiscal trajectory is unsustainable but nobody wants to say to voters: 'So that means we will need to cut these programs.' ''
Erick Erickson, the editor of the Web site redstate.com, was harsher. ''It is full of mom-tested, kid-approved pablum that will make certain hearts on the right sing in solidarity,'' he wrote. ''But like a diet full of sugar, it will actually do nothing but keep making Washington fatter before we crash from the sugar high.''
At the news conference in Virginia, Mr. Boehner and other Republicans said that their plan, particularly the permanent extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, would bring a sense of certainty and confidence that would lead businesses to hire more workers.
''Government gets in the way of job creation in our country,'' Mr. Boehner said, citing his own experience as a small business owner.
But the agenda offered few new initiatives for actually creating jobs, other than the proposal to give a tax deduction of up to 20 percent of income to small businesses.
The Republicans also promised to ''rein in the red tape factory in Washington'' by making it harder for federal agencies to impose new regulations. What the Republicans did not say was how such an initiative would lead to job creation. Aides said that the goal was to create an improved climate for businesses, and that they had purposely refrained from making specific projections about job growth.
But it was on the long-term deficit reduction front where critics, both Democrats on the left and conservatives on the right, seemed to find the most fault with the House Republican agenda, in particular the scant mention of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
''Most of the spending restraint I see is targeted at nondefense discretionary, which is really the least of our problems on the spending side,'' Mr. Bixby said. ''They really take a pass on entitlements.''
Republicans offered more specifics about how they would seek to repeal the Democrats' big health care law. But many of the ideas were offered during the year-long health care debate and independent analysts found that they would do relatively little to cover the uninsured or reduce health spending.
Democrats, at the White House and on Capitol Hill, continued to assail the Republican plan as a return to the policies of President George W. Bush.
Echoing the Republicans' 1994 ''Contract with America'' the new plan, called ''A Pledge to America,'' raises a potpourri of issues and totally ignores others.
It insists on maintaining the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for instance, and calls for tougher enforcement of immigration laws, but makes no mention of trade issues or education. And it mostly brushes past social issues, though it proposes making permanent a ban on the use of tax money for abortions that is now renewed each year.
Some Democrats seized on a comment that Mr. Boehner made at the news conference in response a question about the party's position on conservative social issues, including marriage and abortion. ''We are not going to be any different than we have been,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''We are going to stand up for those things we believe in.''
Democrats quickly turned the sound-bite into fodder for campaign messaging.
But the substantive criticism of the agenda from both ends of the political spectrum suggested that Republicans may still face a challenge in convincing voters that they have fresh ideas and can provide needed counterbalance to the Obama White House.
Still, Mr. Boaz said that the agenda was smart politics.
''There will be some people like me complaining that this is thin gruel,'' he said. But, he added: ''It gives the illusion that the Republicans have a plan. They are not just saying no. And it generally focuses on the issues that the Tea Partiers and the independents are concerned about.''

HEADLINE: In China, Attitudes on Generosity Are Tested

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Like most everything else in China's economy, philanthropy here is in a boom period, fueled by phalanxes of newly minted billionaires and foundations, encouraged by an army of professional advisers on charity and, increasingly, sanctioned by the government.
Which makes the case of Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, who will come to Beijing next week to share their thoughts on philanthropy with some of China's wealthiest people, all the more curious.
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates, the Rockefeller and Carnegie of this age, announced plans last month to invite about 50 of China's superrich to discuss their concept of philanthropy, which includes enlisting the world's wealthiest people to give away at least half their fortunes.
Things appeared to be going swimmingly until early September, when the Chinese news media quoted a Beijing official of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as saying that ''a small number of people'' had declined to come, and that others had asked whether they would be pushed for donations. 
Last week, Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett issued a letter stating that they were not coming to China ''to pressure people to give,'' but to listen. ''China's circumstances are unique, and so its approach to philanthropy will be as well,'' they wrote.
Except for denying a report from Xinhua, the state-run news agency, that only two tycoons had accepted the invitation, the organizers of the event have largely fallen silent.
But the Chinese are unlikely to stop talking soon. In a nation where explosive growth has opened a yawning gap between rich and poor, reports that Chinese billionaires might stiff-arm the invitation have spawned a sort of national Rorschach test of Chinese generosity, not to mention attitudes toward the rich.
''Are Chinese rich scared to be charitable?'' asked The Global Times, the Communist Party's English-language newspaper. Not at all; ''This is the Americans' conspiracy,'' wrote one of 2,000 people who posted comments on the controversy on Sina.com, a major Internet portal. Academics grumbled about efforts to impose Western philanthropic values on Chinese tradition.
Actually, however, Chinese philanthropic tradition was being upended well before the Gates-Buffett dinner was even conceived. In barely a decade, the Chinese economy has created at least 117 billionaires, according to a Forbes magazine ranking, and hundreds of thousands of millionaires by the estimate of Hurun Report, a magazine based in Shanghai whose target audience is the rich. Only the United States has more billionaires.
While China's reported philanthropic donations are now comparatively tiny -- about $8 billion last year, the government says, compared with $308 billion in the United States in 2008 -- changes in China's economic structure and in government policies make that figure almost destined to rise quickly. And, in contrast to the past, riches are starting to flow to social and charitable causes.
''The Chinese have been very generous for a long period of time,'' Rupert Hoogewerf, who publishes Hurun Report, said by telephone. ''The difference has been that they do it between families, and don't publicize it. What we're seeing now is a new era of transparency.''
Translucency might be a better term. More than a few fortunes have been built on corruption, and their owners stay in the shadows. The China Reform Foundation, an economic research group based in Beijing, estimated last month that about $870 billion in corrupt ''gray money'' was being hidden by the wealthiest 10 percent of China's population.
Huang Guangyu, who built an appliance shop into a fortune valued at $2.7 billion to $6.3 billion, was singled out by Hurun Report in 2007 as especially miserly. Today he is in prison, convicted of stock fraud and insider trading.
A Global Times article this month stated that in the last decade, 17 members of an annual list of China's 50 richest people had been convicted of economic crimes.
Ordinary Chinese, steeped in petty government corruption, are often bitterly cynical toward the rich.
''Of course they'll decline the invitation,'' one wrote of the invited billionaires on the Sina.com postings board. ''None of their money is clean!''
Yet a growing number of China's corporate titans are open both about their wealth and about giving it away. The leading example is Yu Pengnian, an 88-year-old real estate baron who gave the last of his $1.3 billion fortune in April to a foundation he created to fund scholarships for poor Chinese students. The latest is Chen Guangbiao, 42, a Jiangsu Province recycling-company owner who has taken the Gates-Buffett pledge to give away his $440 million fortune when he dies.
''Wealth is not something that comes to you when you are born,'' he said in an interview last week. ''It's like water. If you have only a cup, you keep it to yourself. If you have a barrel, you share it with your family. And if you have a river, you share it with everyone.''
This is a new phenomenon, and not only because the money is new. China's Communist Party claims to represent the downtrodden, and has been reluctant to turn to the private sector to address problems of poverty and disease.
But since the outpouring of support for victims of the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, the government now seems to be edging toward a more accommodating attitude about private philanthropy. It offers corporations a tax break of up to 12 percent for charitable gifts, rising to 30 percent for individuals.
This year, a reregistration drive has certified more than 1,000 nonprofit groups as able to accept tax-deductible donations. Government officials have also said that they plan to enact the nation's first charity law, with rules that clearly define what a charity is and how it must operate, by late 2011.
But whether revised rules on charities and nonprofit groups generally will broaden or restrict philanthropic work is unclear, said Jia Xijin, who directs the Nongovernmental Organization Research Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing. While the government has slowly given new leeway to some charitable groups, especially those that provide social services, it keeps a tighter rein on groups that advocate policy changes or raise money on their own.
The government's concern is that ''most public fund-raising organizations need some social cause, and if you organize people,'' she said, ''that means the organization represents some social force.''
For Mr. Chen, the recycling magnate, the best way to encourage philanthropy by the group invited to dine with Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates is to publicize the names of people who decline to attend.
''I'll help you bash them in the media,'' he said. ''We can't be misers.''

HEADLINE: Some Obama Allies Fear School Lunch Bill Could Rob Food Stamp Program

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In her campaign to reduce childhood obesity and improve school nutrition, Michelle Obama has become entangled in a fight with White House allies, including liberal Democrats and advocates for the poor.
At issue is how to pay for additional spending on the school lunch program and other child nutrition projects eagerly sought by the White House. A bill that the House is expected to consider within days would come up with some of the money by cutting future food stamp benefits.
When the Senate passed the bill in early August, Mrs. Obama said she was thrilled. But anti-hunger groups were not. They deluged House members on Thursday with phone calls and e-mails expressing alarm. 
''It is wrong to take money from food stamps to finance child nutrition programs,'' said Edward M. Cooney, executive director of the Congressional Hunger Center, an advocacy group. ''You are taking money from low-income people in one program and spending it on low-income people -- maybe the same people -- in another program.''
The Food Research and Action Center and Catholic Charities USA said they supported expanding child nutrition programs but opposed cutting money for food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
More than 100 House Democrats, including leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, have signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposing the use of food stamp money to pay for the expansion of child nutrition programs. Labor unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the National Education Association, and women's groups have sent similar letters.
Administration officials are pushing House Democrats to pass the Senate bill. The House Democratic whip, James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, sent an e-mail to colleagues this week asking if they supported it.
House Democratic leaders said the House could consider the Senate bill under an expedited procedure that prohibits amendments and requires a two-thirds majority for passage.
Martha B. Coven, a senior staff member at the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the bill ''would make a historic investment in school meal programs and go a long way toward achieving Mrs. Obama's goal of ending the epidemic of childhood obesity in a generation.''
''We support the bill as a whole,'' Ms. Coven said. ''We strongly support House passage of the Senate bill.'' She declined to comment on criticism of the food stamp changes.
Lawmakers from both parties and child nutrition advocates have praised many provisions of the Senate bill. It gives the secretary of agriculture the authority to establish nutrition standards for foods sold in schools during the school day, including vending machine items. And it would require schools to serve more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products.
Also, for the first time in over three decades, it would increase federal reimbursement for school lunches beyond inflation -- to allow for the cost of higher-quality meals. It would also allow more than 100,000 children on Medicaid to qualify for free school meals, without filing applications.
Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: ''I want to pass a child nutrition bill. I am committed to the first lady's campaign. I want to be helpful. But I won't vote for a bill that robs Peter to pay Paul. The White House needs to work with us to find a better way to offset the cost.''
Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, ''While I want a strong and robust reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act, we cannot do it on the backs of the unemployed, underemployed and chronically poor.''
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City weighed in too. He wrote that he was concerned about the health and welfare of the more than one million students in the city's public schools. But he said that Congress should not try to help them at the expense of food stamp recipients.
By reducing future food stamp benefits, Mr. Bloomberg said, the Senate bill ''would reduce the availability of nutritious food at children's homes in order to provide those very same children nutritious options at school.''
Nationwide, more than 41 million people receive food stamps, nearly half of them children. The number of recipients has increased 51 percent since the recession began in December 2007. The average monthly benefit is $133 a person, about $4.40 a day.
The Senate bill would save $2.2 billion over 10 years by eliminating an increase in benefits provided by the 2009 economic stimulus law. Food price inflation has been lower than expected, so the increase could be ended early, in November 2013, proponents say.
Ellen S. Teller of the Food Research and Action Center said the cuts ''would increase poverty and could increase obesity because shoppers would try to stretch their dollars by buying cheaper, calorie-dense food that has low nutritional value.''

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
'Ahead of Time' (No rating, 1:13, in English and Hebrew) The career of Ruth Gruber -- reporter, photographer, civil servant, memoirist, humanitarian and riveting raconteur, now almost 99 -- is remarkable, and not only for a woman of her generation. This documentary covers the striking breadth of its early years (the '30s and '40s), enlivened by her lucid memory and sensible, compassionate bearing. (Andy Webster)20100923
'Alpha and Omega' (PG, 1:28) This animated film about talking wolves in the Canadian Rockies that learn lessons about cooperation and love occasionally has a touch of old-fashioned grandeur in its western vistas, but otherwise it's funny-animal and noble-beast business as usual. (Mike Hale)20100923 
'The American' (R, 1:45) George Clooney is a shadowy assassin-type who settles down in an Italian village, where trouble follows him and he falls for a local prostitute played by Violante Placido. It all looks good -- Mr. Clooney, Ms. Placido, Italy -- and the director, Anton Corbijn, manages a quiet, oblique tone. But in the end the movie is not much more than an anthology of beautiful shots and world-weary attitudes. The Henry James novel by the same name is much better. (A. O. Scott)20100923
- 'Animal Kingdom' (R, 1:52) The relative absence of gun battles and car chases in ''Animal Kingdom,'' a powerfully acted Australian answer to ''Goodfellas,'' helps it sustain a mood of deepening dread. It goes out of its way to deglamorize the criminal life and portray its family of crooks as warped psychotic thugs in a losing enterprise. (Stephen Holden)20100923
'Cairo Time' (PG, 1:29) Patricia Clarkson and Alexander Siddig play a melancholy romantic duet, with the Egyptian capital as an entrancing, chaotic backdrop. (Scott)20100923
'Catfish' (PG-13, 1:26) A sloppy, shallow, ethically compromised documentary and also a fascinating document of life, love and self-creation in the age of Facebook. (Scott)20100923
'Devil' (PG-13, 1:20) This serviceable burst of high-end hokum traps five strangers in an elevator in a Philadelphia office tower, all harboring sins in dire need of atonement. Classing up a flimsy, religion-themed plot (by M. Night Shyamalan) with the kind of limber cinematography only someone like Tak Fujimoto can deliver, the director John Erick Dowdle remains cool when the lights fail and the blood begins to flow. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20100923
'Easy A' (PG-13, 1:33) Whatever else it accomplishes, the sassy high school comedy ''Easy A'' commands attention for the irresistible presence of Emma Stone, playing a good girl who pretends to be bad. (Holden)20100923
'Eat Pray Love' (PG-13, 2:13) Post-divorce spiritual globe-trotting, starring Julia Roberts, from Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling memoir. Nothing to change your life, but honest and satisfying all the same. (Scott)20100923
- 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' (No rating, 1:27) Looking like a documentary but feeling like a monumental con, this film from the reclusive British street artist Banksy follows Thierry Guetta, an antic French videographer who embarks on a film about street artists and finally becomes one himself. Scrutinizing the lemminglike behavior of many enthusiasts, Banksy mischievously exfoliates the next-big-thing hunger and the posers who pursue it. (Catsoulis)20100923
'The Expendables' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone and a whole lot of other tough guys in the most extravagant display of dry aged beef outside of a Chicago steakhouse. (Scott)20100923
'Genius Within: The Inner Life of Glenn Gould' (No rating, 1:46) This thorough biography of the Canadian pianist acknowledges his eccentricities and examines some previously unknown details of his personal life, but spends most of its energy making the case that he was an artist whose importance went far beyond his innovative interpretations of Bach and other composers. (Scott)20100923
- 'Get Low' (PG-13, 1:42) Robert Duvall plays a Tennessee hermit who arranges his own funeral while he is still alive. Bill Murray is the undertaker who agrees to organize the service, and Sissy Spacek is an old flame of the not quite deceased. The story, based on a real-life anecdote of Depression-era Appalachia, veers into some corny and overfamiliar territory, but the telling is easy and assured, and the cast is hard to beat. (Scott)20100923
'The Girl Who Played With Fire' (No rating, 2:09, in Swedish) Lisbeth Salander returns, framed for murder and embroiled in an investigation that leads in the direction of her monstrous father. This Swedish-language adaptation of the second novel in Stieg Larsson's best-selling trilogy is better than its predecessor, but apart from Noomi Rapace's ferocious performance as Lisbeth, it doesn't rise about the level of not-bad television. (Scott)20100923
'Going the Distance' (R, 1:36) A surprisingly not bad romantic comedy -- high praise indeed -- thanks in no small part to Justin Long and Drew Barrymore, playing a couple whose love is tested by geographical separation and a tough job market. (It's funnier than that makes it sound.) (Scott)20100923
'The Good Soldier' (No rating) (1:19) These compelling stories are accompanied by a barrage of graphic images of wartime death, shocking at first -- which of course is the point -- but eventually too much, to the point of ghoulishness. (Neil Genzlinger)20100923
'Heartbreaker' (No rating, 1:44, in French) This slapstick-infused French imitation of a Hollywood romantic comedy is saved by Romain Duris's frisky portrayal of an ethical gigolo who is hired to break up mismatched couples, without sleeping with the women. (Holden)20100923
- 'I Am Love' (No rating, 2:00, in Italian) A visually lush melodrama from Luca Guadagnino about the young matriarch (Tilda Swinton) of a wealthy Milanese family whose passions and suffering fuel this art-house gloss on the women's picture. (Manohla Dargis)20100923
'I'm Still Here' (R, 1:48) The actor Joaquin Phoenix puts himself front and center in this gloss on the mutually parasitic worlds of celebritydom and the entertainment media. His brother-in-law, the actor Casey Affleck, plays the director. (Dargis)20100923
'Inception' (PG-13, 2:32) This elegantly action-filled brainteaser from Christopher Nolan (''The Dark Knight,'' ''Memento'') stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a spy for hire who burrows into the dreams of his targets and nearly gets lost in his own subconscious, where a mysterious woman played by Marion Cotillard is waiting for him. The film is entertaining enough but not quite up to its grandest ambitions, and it works best as a heist movie with a few extra twists and visual surprises. (Scott)20100923
'Jack Goes Boating' (R, 1:31) Philip Seymour Hoffman directs and stars in this mopey, minor-key story, adapted from Robert Glaudini's play, about a shy, sad fellow looking for love. Amy Ryan is the woman he falls for, but Daphne Rubin-Vega and John Ortiz as Jack's best friends (a volatile married couple) give the film its heart and authenticity. (Scott)20100923
- 'The Kids Are All Right' (R, 1:45) American family life in all its imperfections, perfectly captured by the director Lisa Cholodenko and a flawless, peerless cast led by Julianne Moore and Annette Bening as a lesbian couple with two teenage children and a couple of decades worth of unspoken tensions and frustration. These pop to the surface when Mark Ruffalo shows up, playing the children's biological but heretofore invisible father. What follows is brilliantly funny without exaggeration, and heartbreaking without a hint of melodramatic manipulation. (Scott)20100923
- 'Kings of Pastry' (No rating, 1:24, in English and French) The veteran documentarians Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker tag along with several contenders for membership in the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France, an exclusive fraternity of pastry chefs. The film builds in interest and intrigue as it goes along, helped immeasurably by the choice of the astonishingly good-natured chef Jacquy Pfeiffer as their chief protagonist. The competition involves nerve-racking suspense and bittersweet resolution -- you'll be surprised by how devastating the collapse of a chocolate tower can be. (Hale)20100923
- 'The Last Exorcism' (PG-13, 1:28) Perched at the intersection of faith, folklore and female puberty, this genuinely eerie little movie trails a Louisiana preacher (Patrick Fabian) as he films an expose-exorcism of a teenage girl (Ashley Bell). Relying on dry humor and an accumulating atmosphere of psychological dysfunction, Daniel Stamm directs his single-camera viewpoint cleanly and with a confidence that falters only in the final reel. (Catsoulis)20100923
- 'Last Train Home' (No rating, 1:27, in Mandarin language and Sichuan dialect) Lixin Fan's wrenching and compassionate documentary examines a complex and overwhelming social phenomenon -- the role of migrant laborers in China's fast-changing economy -- from the standpoint of a family that is tested and fractured by globalization. (Scott)20100923
- 'Leaves of Grass' (R, 1:44) Edward Norton plays polar-opposite twins in this feisty, pot-filled tale from Tim Blake Nelson. One twin is a marijuana grower in Oklahoma; the other escaped those Oklahoma roots for the Ivy League. The Ivy Leaguer is drawn back home for what he thinks is his brother's funeral, and all heck breaks loose in a fusion of the funny and the violent. (Genzlinger)20100923
- 'Life During Wartime' (No rating, 1:37) Todd Solondz's new movie revisits many of the characters from ''Happiness'' (1998) and matches that film for creepy comedy while expanding on its sense of compassion and ethical seriousness. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village . (Scott)20100923
'Machete' (R, 1:45) The pace is swift, the tone playful, and the screenplay peppered with one-liners in the splatter comedy that takes on the immigration debate. Whether mowed down by gunfire or dispatched by sheaves of blades, the bodies pile up in split-second blasts of carnage. (Holden)20100923
'Mao's Last Dancer' (PG, 1:57) In Bruce Beresford's film, based on the true story of a Chinese dancer who was allowed to come to Houston to study in the early 1980s and subsequently defected, ballet and modern Chinese history are window dressing for what's essentially a deluxe old-fashioned tear-jerker. (Hale)20100923
- 'Mesrine: Killer Instinct' (Part 1) and 'Mesrine: Public Enemy No. 1' (Part 2) (R, 1:53 and 2:14, in French) ''Mesrine'' may not be a tragic gangster epic in the tradition of the ''The Godfather'' movies; it is too flighty and episodic. But it has a monumental lead performance by Vincent Cassel. He fuses the cobralike menace of the young Robert Mitchum with the whipsaw, shape-shifting volatility of classic Robert De Niro. (Holden)20100923
- 'My Dog Tulip' (No rating, 1:23) Its hand-drawn animation by the directors Paul and Sandra Fierlinger and Christopher Plummer's understated conversational voice, tossing off profound, heartfelt observations, combine to make this film, based on J. R. Ackerley's celebrated memoir, one of the most sophisticated dog movies ever created. (Holden)20100923
'Never Let Me Go' (R, 1:43) Mark Romanek directs this pretty, emotionally arid adaptation of the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, with Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley as three young people raised to become organ donators. (Dargis)20100923
'The Other Guys' (PG-13, 1:47) Mostly the same guy -- Will Ferrell -- doing some goofy stuff in a buddy-cop action-comedy, with Mark Wahlberg as his partner. Pretty funny for a while, then runs out of steam. (Scott)20100923
'Piranha 3D' (R, 1:22) Lots of flesh, naked and chomped. Should be funnier and scarier, but makes a decent, nasty effort to be both. (Scott)20100923
'Resident Evil: Afterlife' (R, 1:30) More moribund than its thronging undead, this witless fourth installment in the video-game-derived saga of a comely zombie hunter (Milla Jovovich) spends most of its running time in a Los Angeles prison surrounded by hordes of pustular flesh-eaters. Assisted by helpful freeze-frames to allow us to admire the extra dimension, a small band of survivors fights off the infected and finally heads for the sewers. The script follows. (Catsoulis)20100923
'Salt' (PG-13, 1:39) Angelina Jolie runs and jumps and shoots and does all the expected action-movie things with such velocity and verve that the emptiness and absurdity of this thriller (cleanly directed by Phillip Noyce) may not register until the last explosion has stopped echoing. (Scott)20100923
- 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' (PG-13, 1:48) A video game, a comic-book adaptation, a romance, an action movie, an almost-musical -- and most of all a fast, clever burst of clever, winning youthful energy. (Scott)20100923
- 'Soul Kitchen' (No rating, 1:39, in German and Greek) What gives the hoary gags in this amiable farce, set in a dingy restaurant in Hamburg, Germany, some screwball vitality is the exuberance with which the German-Turkish director Fatih Akin piles them on. (Holden)20100923
'Takers' (PG-13, 1:47) A movie about guys who take stuff that is every bit as imaginative as its title. The clothes are nice, though, and there are some decent action sequences and performances (notably from Matt Dillon and Tip Harris, better known as the rapper T. I.). (Scott)20100923
'The Town' (R, 2:05) Ben Affleck directs and stars in this not-bad Boston crime thriller, with decent action, good performances -- notably Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively -- and some fine, if somewhat fetishized, local color. (Scott)20100923
- 'Toy Story 3' (G, 1:38) The further adventures of Buzz, Woody and the others, and also a richly emotional meditation on love, loss, consumer capitalism and the passing of time. (Scott)20100923
'The Virginity Hit' (R, 1:26) In Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko's teenage sex comedy, presented as a series of amateur videos posted on YouTube, scenes that could be funny and even liberating in a movie like ''American Pie'' end up looking coarse and slightly depressing as scripted pseudo-reality. When the plot takes a serious turn, the camera settles down, and the performances by the cast of unknowns become more relaxed and believable. (Hale)20100923
'We Are Family' (No rating, 1:55 in Hindi) A Bollywood remake of the 1998 American movie ''Stepmom,'' this go-for-broke weepie, produced by Karan Johar, is not shy about milking every last ounce of sentiment from its rather creepy premise: a dying mother (Kajol) decides her ex-husband's girlfriend (Kareena Kapoor) should be her successor. Often unbelievable, the film nonetheless gets a jolt of emotion from Kajol's honest performance. (Rachel Saltz)20100923
'Winter's Bone' (R, 1:40) Debra Granik's flinty Ozark noir follows a teenage girl's search for her missing father, an expert methamphetamine cooker who has fallen afoul of his own outlaw kin. Jennifer Lawrence's lead performance is flawless and helps to lift this film above at least some of the usual independent-movie assumptions about rural poverty in America. (Scott)20100923
'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' (R, 1:38) Sexual longing and metaphysical emptiness with an all-start cast in London, written and directed by -- no points for guessing right! -- Woody Allen. (Scott)20100923
Film Series
Coleman Miller: 'Uso Justo' and other shorts (Saturday) A selection of work by this Chicago-based independent filmmaker, who creates many of his films by rearranging and reprinting found footage. The program includes his 2005 ''Uso Justo,'' a narrative -- about an experimental filmmaker who arrives in a small town in Mexico to make a new movie -- forged from bits and pieces of a 1959 Mexican feature.

HEADLINE: (High-End) Values for Special Occasions

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON

 BODY:
A reader wanted a fabulous meal -- money no object. Another desired something interesting on the Upper East Side. Keep those questions coming, by e-mail to dinejournal@nytimes.com, or on Twitter.com/samsifton.
Q. My wife and I will be having dinner in New York on a Saturday night in October, and I want a fabulous meal and decor. Money is not an issue, and I am thinking Daniel. What suggestions would you make?
A. Money is not an issue! I love that phrase. It comes up in my correspondence more often than you might think. It leads me to believe that the economy may be farther along the road to recovery than many yet think. No one was saying, ''Money is not an issue'' two years ago. 
But of course money is always an issue. To steal from David Mamet, who put the line in his 2001 film, ''Heist'': ''That's why they call it money.''
You are thinking about having dinner at Daniel. The two of you can get three courses there for $105 and pair these with wines, and walk out for around $300. That's fair value if the food and drink are excellent, with service to match. (Reliably they are at Daniel.) But I bet there is a point -- and you could find it rather quickly, I'd double down to say, at Megu in TriBeCa -- at which the money part of the formula suddenly starts to matter quite a bit. For myself, this experience has happened most recently at Nello. Why risk that feeling? You've come all this way. You were thinking Daniel, so Daniel it shall be.
Q. I live on the Upper East Side, which I often think of as the land that the food revolution forgot. Ethnic places are thin on the ground, as are young, exciting chefs. Can you recommend some local top-notch eats?
A. Ethnic places? Heidelberg is still open, isn't it? You can get a fine schweinebraten there, a taste of old Yorkville, of revolutions long past. That's eating you won't find on Bedford Avenue, pal. More seriously, there is Cascabel Taqueria on Second Avenue. Also: Donguri, Spigolo, Szechuan Chalet and Cafe d'Alsace. The Times has spent some time in all of them. I think they are all worth visits. You need to remember that whichever you choose, you're still going to emerge into the Upper East Side, so neatly divided between frat packers and the silk-stocking set that gave the neighborhood its cachet. Sometimes it's best to embrace this. Put me in your shoes, I'd try to move into the Carlyle and eat three meals a week at Quatorze Bis.
Q. My husband and I got married in New York City. We visit at least twice a year from San Francisco and are planning our 25th-anniversary celebration there. We've been to most of the ''usual suspects'' (Le Bernardin, Jean Georges, Per Se, Daniel, Babbo, et cetera) and have generally loved them all. Our top considerations for the big event are: Gramercy Tavern, Bouley, Gotham -- oh, I could go on. Do you have any tricks up your sleeve? A restaurant with great energy, fabulous food but not too loud and, yes, romantic?
A. Ah, the usual suspects! I wonder who got dumped into the Latin pool with the other ceteras. Eleven Madison Park? If not, I'd suggest it for you first. Daniel Humm, the chef, received four stars from Frank Bruni of The Times in 2009. Since then, as the owners told The Times recently, there have been changes small and large, all meant to make the experience of dining there all the more special. This strikes me as a good sign for people in town for a 25th anniversary. In addition, it is difficult to think of a restaurant that more plainly says -- in decor, service, food and total execution -- that it is of, by and for New York City.
Q. In a month my siblings and I, along with spouses, will be in Manhattan. We've lined up places to eat except for our steak dinner. We know the top-tier places with their top-tier prices, but is there a good steak dinner without the top-tier prices?
A. The easy answer is Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecote, on Lexington Avenue at 52nd Street, where the inexpensive prix fixe steak frites dinner is hardly top-tier but certainly fulfills the mandate for a good steak dinner. It's like eating in a Paris designed by the people who were behind Horn & Hardart. Another option, though, is to voyage south to the financial district, where you can reliably find a good steak dinner at Harry's, in the basement of the old India House on Hanover Square, and another at the blue-collar financial services tavern that is Bobby Van's on Broad Street.
These aren't cheap restaurants, but they're fairly priced and enjoyable ones at which you can have a good steak and better conversation with your family. That is sometimes the whole point of going out to dinner.

HEADLINE: Ways to Measure Student Learning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Scientifically Tested Tests,'' by Susan Engel (Op-Ed, Sept. 20), is a breath of fresh air. We have better, more humanistic and authentic ways to judge students' learning rather than succumbing to ''laboring once again in the shadow of standardized tests.''
Prospective teachers coming out of many teacher education programs are familiar with the range of assessments in students' learning. The larger pragmatic -- and moral -- issue is: Even when they know what works well for student learning and assessment, what do they do in the face of the tremendous pressure to teach to the test? 
Especially with our current economic woes, it is tough for me to tell them to give up their jobs and take the moral high road.
We have created a culture of fear, and we wind up schooling -- standardizing -- students, not truly educating them.
If we want an educated American citizenry, we need to summon our collective moral courage, if not outrage, in the face of the dubious value of standardized testing.
John Gabriel Chicago, Sept. 20, 2010
The writer is an associate professor at the School of Education, DePaul University.
To the Editor:
Thank you, Susan Engel, for offering options to the current formats for testing and for alerting us to what we really want to know about our children. Can they think? Can they reason? Do they read? Can they apply what they know?
Janice Koch Fulton, Md., Sept. 20, 2010
The writer is professor emerita, Department of Curriculum and Teaching, Hofstra University, and past president of the Association for Science Teacher Education.
To the Editor:
Susan Engel has it right: there are more educationally sound ways to measure what children know and can do than fill-in-the-bubble, high-stakes tests. What's more, they work.
With a test waiver granted by the Regents, a consortium of high schools across New York State uses a system of school-based, practitioner-developed and externally validated performance-based assessment.
Such a system requires students to demonstrate college-ready proficiency in extended analytic writing, critical thinking, problem solving and oral communication across subject disciplines in order to graduate. The results? Higher graduation rates, lower dropout rates and better college-level performance than their test-assessed peers.
While the system is more demanding of teachers, it is also more professionally satisfying. That's probably why so many teachers and schools want to participate.
So why the foot-dragging by school officials? Perhaps it's just easier for politicians and school officials to use public relations pundits and their manipulated numbers to mislead parents and the public.
Ann Cook Director, New York Performance Standards Consortium New York, Sept. 21, 2010
To the Editor:
Susan Engel is right that we have narrowed our choices about how and what to test in our schools. Her list of alternative indicators of student knowledge, skill, interest and ability are all worth pursuing.
But I doubt that any of them would be of much help to a teacher trying to assist a child having trouble learning his phonics, a student who can't grasp long division or a group that is unmotivated and seems disconnected from learning.
Conventional standardized tests -- with their attendant loss of context, meaning and personal experience -- are certainly not the answer. Performance assessment through observation is.
Our research on low-income, urban, minority children enrolled in kindergarten to third grade shows that those who have been in classrooms where teachers use observational techniques far outperform a matched group in reading and math.
This is not because any kind of testing -- performance-based or not -- is a magic bullet. It's because performance assessment changes the way teachers teach by focusing their attention on all children across all curriculum domains over time in relation to standards. This is the alternative we need in our public schools.
Samuel J. Meisels Chicago, Sept. 20, 2010
The writer is president of Erikson Institute, a graduate school in child development.
To the Editor:
To Susan Engel's examples of weaknesses in standardized testing, others would add the tests' proneness to manipulation by coaching and by annual adjustments.
Since coaching concentrates on specific topics and skills tested, it limits broader learning in not only literacy and math, the two most widely tested subjects, but also many other important subjects like social studies, history and the arts.
In my state, Arkansas, test vendors change every few years. The specific psychometrics used to make different vendors' test results comparable and the annual equalizations for scoring the same vendors' tests from year to year are not disclosed. Thus, we lack confidence in year-to-year variations.
After all the years of testing, with their increased importance and their many shortcomings, can we move to the broader assessments suggested by Ms. Engel?

HEADLINE: Outspoken, Irascible and Out of a Job, Chris Daly Improvises

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS. 
estevens@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
It is something of a feat to be branded the most impossible, irascible, ultra-liberal politician in San Francisco. It is less of an achievement to be impossible, irascible and perhaps unemployable. 
Chris Daly, one of the most outspoken members of the Board of Supervisors for the last decade (among his many claims to fame is having his associate dress as a chicken to taunt Mayor Gavin Newsom), has spent recent months mulling possible second acts.
Because of term limits, the 38-year-old Mr. Daly, whose district includes the gritty Tenderloin and the trendy SoMa neighborhoods, is being forced to find another job. He has a wife and two small children to support.
Supervisors are paid nearly $100,000 a year. Mr. Daly's last day on the payroll will be Jan. 8.
It is a daunting prospect for someone who dropped out of college and who has a knack for alienating people. An assortment of foes -- the major local newspapers, ''downtown'' business interests, even union groups -- offer few prospects of future support or employment, and Mr. Daly said, ''They have cut me off at the knees in terms of higher office.''
''There really is no job for me,'' he said. ''What do you do when you are the most controversial figure in the city?''
''I looked on Craigslist for jobs during Board of Supervisor meetings,'' he said. ''There was nothing -- absolutely nothing. Nowhere that would hire me.''
Mr. Daly's tenure on the board has been marked by his pursuit of various controversial initiatives. His robust support of tenant-friendly housing policies and his opposition to the sit/lie law, for example, have generally vexed the city's bourgeois and business classes.
So with seemingly no other options, Mr. Daly has chosen to go into business himself. He and a partner are in the process of buying Buck Tavern on a rough block of Market Street. The plan is to rename it Daly's Dive Bar & Grill and create a gathering place for those who share Mr. Daly's progressive politics.
''As a culturally Irish, washed-up politician, thinking about what I can do, it was painfully easy to decide,'' Mr. Daly said as he sat in a dark booth in the tavern. ''Everything else is a dead end.''
He is not worried about his lack of business experience. His share of the purchase is being financed by a loan from his parents, so having to deal with banks was not an issue.
He is careful to explain that his family is not among the ruling class: ''My family does not own any of the means of production.'' But he is very grateful for their support, saying, ''If you have access to capital, you can make money.''
Michael Gouddou, the man selling Buck Tavern to Mr. Daly, stopped by during the interview to say hello.
Is it hard to do business in San Francisco? ''So and so,'' Mr. Gouddou said. ''They nickel and dime you'' with fees.
Mr. Gouddou looked relieved to be moving on. ''I'm happy for him,'' he said, nodding in Mr. Daly's direction.

HEADLINE: Use of Midwives Rises, Challenging the State to Respond

BYLINE: By JESSICA REAVES

 BODY:
After three ''really traumatic'' hospital births, Alyssa Ruben was determined to have her fourth child at home. She hired a midwife, and eight months later, Ms. Ruben delivered a healthy baby girl at her home in Geneva.
''It was amazing,'' she said.
It also was illegal. Under state law, the only legal home births are those attended by a physician or a nurse midwife, an advanced-practice nurse with a secondary degree in midwifery. Kimberly McCarty, who attended Ms. Ruben, is a direct-entry midwife, an unlicensed practitioner who lacks a nursing degree. Ms. McCarty completed a three-year, informal apprenticeship with another direct-entry midwife.
Haunted by a fear of felony charges and jail time, Ms. McCarty moved to Wisconsin, one of 27 states where direct-entry midwives can practice legally. Ms. Ruben, who is expecting her fifth child in October and plans to become a midwife herself, soon followed with her family. 
''My husband got a new job in Wisconsin,'' she said, ''but we knew we wanted to move there because of the midwifery laws, and also because Kim is there.''
While Ms. Ruben's devotion to her midwife is exceptional, her decision to forgo a hospital delivery is not. After decades of decline, home births are on the rise in the United States, up 5 percent from 2004 to 2005, and remain steady at 25,000 in 2006 -- the last year for which figures are available -- according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
Reasons for choosing home births vary. Some women cite religious beliefs. Christian Scientists, for example, categorically refuse medical interventions, while some ultra-orthodox Jewish views on female modesty rule out a hospital birth. Other women opt for home births to avoid Caesarean sections, which are also increasing.
Each year, 700 to 1,000 babies are born at home in Illinois, many of them in rural locations, according to the Illinois Department of Vital Health Statistics. Licensed home-birth practitioners work in just 7 of the state's 102 counties, and most are concentrated in Lake and Cook Counties, leaving the majority of Illinois home births unattended, or attended illegally by someone whose education and licensing are unregulated.
That could change as early as November. After 30 years of trying to get the legislature to license direct-entry midwives, Illinois's midwifery organizations are guardedly optimistic. In May, the State Senate passed the Home Birth Safety Act. A House vote is pending.
The bill's supporters say it toughens standards and protects pregnant women and fetuses from untrained practitioners, while allowing qualified midwives to practice openly and to transport emergency cases to hospitals without fear of reprisal or arrest. (Women often register home births as ''unassisted'' to protect their midwives.)
State Representative Robyn Gabel, Democrat of Evanston, is the bill's chief sponsor. ''It's an uphill battle in the House,'' Ms. Gabel said.
That the bill has made it this far is testament to the midwifery community's newfound political acumen and its first lobbyist, hired by the Coalition for Illinois Midwifery in 2006.
The bill's opponents, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Illinois State Medical Society and the American Medical Association, argue that home births are inherently more dangerous than births in medically supervised settings. Also resisting the bill, though more quietly, are members of rural midwifery groups that have operated under the radar and off the grid for years, and would prefer to remain that way.
''We just don't think home is a safe environment for delivery,'' said Dr. Jacques Abramowicz, co-director of the Fetal and Neonatal Medicine Center at Rush University Medical Center and a Fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. ''Childbirth is very dynamic, and it can be a very dangerous process. In the vast majority of cases, nothing happens. However, if an emergency occurs, it happens very fast -- in two, three, four minutes.''
Rachel Dolan Wickersham, president of the Coalition for Illinois Midwifery and the vice president of the Illinois Council of Certified Professional Midwives, is the midwife groups' lobbyist. She said she was frustrated by the bill's opponents in the medical community.
''There's just no room for negotiation,'' Ms. Wickersham said. ''It's a turf battle. It's about power and control. These women are going to have babies at home. There's no question about that. Why would anyone want to keep the situation so that the person attending them has no regulated training or is afraid to transport them to a hospital in an emergency?''
Whether home births are riskier has not been definitively shown. There is evidence to support both physicians' and midwives' positions.
But in 2008, Childbirth Connection, a nonprofit, maternal health research organization, co-authored a report based on hundreds of studies of maternity care in the United States. It said medical interventions, even in low-risk pregnancy and labor, had increased substantially in the past two decades. The number of induced labors, for example, doubled from 1990 to 2005, while Caesarean sections accounted for a record-high 40 percent of United States hospital births -- versus 4.5 percent in 1965.
Meanwhile, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, maternal mortality in the United States is on the rise. Midwifery advocates say these figures support their contention that the majority of Caesarean sections are unnecessary and potentially dangerous.
After three hospital births, Jamie Stoltzfus of Decatur knew she hated the way epidurals made her feel, and thought a water birth, in which the baby is born into a pool or bathtub, might be a good alternative for her fourth delivery.
Her doctor was unenthusiastic. ''She said something like, 'Oh, honey, hospitals don't really do that,'' Ms. Stoltzfus said. ''It's too messy to clean up afterward.' ''
Now expecting her seventh child -- her fourth home birth -- Ms. Stoltzfus said she had no qualms about using a direct-entry midwife. ''I know my midwife's qualifications are as good or better than some of the doctors I've used in the past,'' she said.
Kristina Stevens graduated from nursing school at the University of Illinois at Chicago in May and began a three-year course to become a legal nurse midwife. She supports the Home Birth Safety Act.
''There's a trend of more women having home births,'' Ms. Stevens said, ''and they need trained practitioners.''
Obstetricians are not practicing in the southern part of the state, she said, because liability costs are so high. ''They need to make room for people who will do that work,'' Ms. Stevens said, ''and there has to be legislation to support those people.''
Dr. Abramowicz conceded that poor women in some areas do not have anyone to attend their deliveries. ''But the solution is not to allow very untrained people to become licensed,'' he said. Instead, he said, the government should give incentives, including school-loan forgiveness programs, to rural obstetricians.
While economics and geography certainly inform the midwifery debate, one question cuts to its core: What is the extent of a pregnant woman's autonomy? Midwifery advocates say women are often patronized or ignored when medical decisions are made during hospital deliveries.
Cassandre Creswell of Chicago, whose first child was born in a hospital, had her second at home to avoid the ''combative experience'' of defending a natural-birth plan in a delivery room.
Dr. Abramowicz conceded the point, saying, ''To tell you we are ecstatic when a woman comes in with a birth plan would not be the truth.''
But, he added, hospital births can be a collaborative experience between patient and doctor. ''We're not telling women what to do,'' he said. ''We're telling women what we think is best.''
That is unlikely to sway women like Alyssa Ruben.
If she developed risk factors, Ms. Ruben said, ''I would obviously go to the hospital.'' But, she added, she vastly prefers the care from her direct-entry midwife.
''It's very woman-centered, totally different than what happens in the hospital,'' she said. ''I'm in charge of my labor and my pregnancy, not taking a back seat the way doctors want you to do.''

HEADLINE: Obama Presses China to Let Currency Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- President Obama increased pressure on China to immediately revalue its currency on Thursday, devoting most of a two-hour meeting with China's prime minister to the issue and sending the message, according to one of his top aides, that if ''the Chinese don't take actions, we have other means of protecting U.S. interests.''
But Prime Minister Wen Jiabao barely budged beyond his familiar talking points about gradual ''reform'' of China's currency policy, leaving it unclear whether Mr. Obama's message would change Beijing's economic or political calculus.
The unusual focus on this single issue at such a high level was clearly an effort by the White House to make the case that Mr. Obama was putting American jobs and competitiveness at the top of the agenda in a relationship that has endured strains in recent weeks on everything from territorial disputes to sanctions against Iran and North Korea. 
Democrats in Congress are threatening to pass legislation before the midterm elections that would slap huge tariffs on Chinese goods to undermine the advantages Beijing has enjoyed from a currency, the renminbi, that experts say is artificially weakened by 20 to 25 percent.
Mr. Obama's aides said he was embracing the threat of tariffs and new trade actions against China at the World Trade Organization to gain some leverage over the Chinese, but was also trying to head off any action that would lead to a destructive trade war.
Jeffrey Bader, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, told reporters that the two men engaged in ''a lengthy discussion about the impact and the politics of the issue.'' One Chinese official speculated Thursday that Mr. Obama's insistence on spending so much time on the issue was motivated by pre-election politics, suggesting that the pressure might abate after early November.
While the United States has been pressing China for years to lift the strict controls on its currency, which keep Chinese exports competitive and more factory workers employed, American voters and lawmakers have only recently seized on exchange rates as a potent political issue. Mr. Obama pressed much harder on Thursday than during a visit to Beijing last year, perhaps because a Chinese commitment several months ago to allow the value of the currency to rise has resulted in a change of less than 2 percent.
The meeting with Mr. Wen came as the United States appeared to lean toward its longtime ally, Japan, in an increasingly heated standoff between China and Japan over who has claim on territory in the East China Sea.
In Washington, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that China and Japan should sort out the issue themselves, but that ''We would fulfill our alliance responsibilities,'' a term that clearly referred to the American military alliance with Japan.
But the United States also tried not to inflame the dispute. It barely came up at the meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Wen, Mr. Bader said, adding that despite the talk of America's obligation to back its military ally, ''we have no expectation in any known universe that this would escalate to that kind of a level.''
Mr. Obama's meeting with Mr. Wen, in a spare conference room usually used by members of the Security Council, came minutes after the president told the United NationsGeneral Assembly that his efforts to engage friends and adversaries were beginning to bear fruit.
He called on Arab states to support fragile Middle East peace talks and warned Iran that it would face sustained international pressure if it did not negotiate seriously over its nuclear program.
Iranian officials have hinted they are prepared to resume talks, without setting a date.
''The door remains open to diplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it,'' said Mr. Obama, who plans to address the Iranian people directly on Friday in an interview with BBC's Persian service. ''But the Iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment, and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program.''
If Iran fails to meet its obligations under international nonproliferation treaties, he added, it ''must be held accountable.''
In June, the United Nations Security Council imposed its fourth round of sanctions against Iran, which were followed by harsher measures by the United States and European and Asian nations. On Wednesday, Russia made clear that it would not be fulfilling a contract to sell Iran an advanced missile system.
Mr. Obama also called on Israel to extend its partial freeze on building new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, construction that is one of the most contentious issues between Israelis and Palestinians.
The moratorium is set to expire this weekend, and hard-won talks could be stymied if the Israelis fail to extend it and the Palestinians decide to walk away from the table.
''Our position on this issue is well known,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We believe that the moratorium should be extended. We also believe that talks should press on until completed.''
Clashes on Wednesday between Israeli security forces and Palestinians in the Old City of Jerusalem underscored the fragile state of affairs in the region and the potential for violent outbursts if the negotiations fall apart.
Mr. Obama acknowledged the possibility of ''terror, or turbulence, or posturing or petty politics'' to disrupt the negotiations, but exhorted world leaders to stand behind the peace process.
''When we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations, an independent state of Palestine, living in peace with Israel,'' he said.
Tonally, Mr. Obama's speech to the General Assembly was dramatically different from the one he delivered last year, in his maiden appearance as a new president promising change not only at home, but in America's dealings with the rest of the world. If the 2009 speech was about the promise of a new approach, and often interrupted by applause, this speech was far more about pressing countries to take up what he called their ''responsibilities.''
''Last year he sought to signal that U.S. foreign policy was under new management and intended to work better with others, just what his audience wanted to hear,'' James M. Lindsay, the director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote shortly after the speech was over. ''This year he made clear he wants to get things done, and that will require others to do things they would prefer not to do.'' He added, ''He shouldn't be surprised to discover that others are slow to follow.''
Mr. Obama, at turns sweeping and philosophical, told the delegates and world leaders that it was ''our destiny'' to endure a time of recession, war and conflict, and spoke out broadly in support of open governments and human rights.

HEADLINE: Iran Leader Says U.S. Planned 9/11 Attacks

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran made a series of incendiary remarks in his speech to the United NationsGeneral Assembly on Thursday, notably the claim that the United States orchestrated the Sept. 11 attacks to rescue its declining economy, to reassert its weakening grip on the Middle East and to save Israel.
Those comments prompted at least 33 delegations to walk out, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Costa Rica, all 27 members of the European Union and the union's representative, diplomats said.
The annual General Assembly started formally on Thursday, with scores of presidents, kings and ministers expected to address the gathering over the coming week. The speeches often fail to break new ground or lack electricity, so the occasional theatrics inevitably attract considerable attention. 
Mr. Ahmadinejad rarely disappoints on that scale, although he seemed to go out of his way to sabotage any comments he made previously this week about Iran's readiness for dialogue with the United States. The theme of his often flowery speech was that the capitalist world order was collapsing and he cited three examples: the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, and the pressure on Iran over its nuclear program.
He said there were three theories about the origins of the Sept. 11 attacks, including ''that some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining American economy and its grips on the Middle East in order also to save the Zionist regime.''
The United States Mission to the United Nations swiftly issued a terse response. ''Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people, Mr. Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable,'' it said in a statement.
It was not the first time Mr. Ahmadinejad espoused the theory, but never before so publicly. ''The majority of the American people as well as other nations and politicians agree with this view,'' he said.
In other fallout, Nick Clegg, Britain's deputy prime minister, will tell the General Assembly on Friday that he had been on the verge of welcoming progress toward renewed talks on Iran's nuclear program.
''But instead, once again, an issue of grave global concern has been overshadowed by the bizarre, offensive and attention-grabbing pronouncements by President Ahmedinejad from this podium yesterday,'' Mr. Clegg said in prepared remarks released in advance by the British Mission to the United Nations. ''They deserve to do neither.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad obviously delights in being provocative during his annual visit to the United Nations. He framed his comments about Sept. 11 as an examination of opinions, an approach he has used repeatedly in questioning the Holocaust.
But his assertion that the majority of Americans agree with him surely lacked any factual basis. As did his claim that reviving the American economy was the motive behind the devastating attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon; the United States economy declined significantly after the attacks. In his interviews with journalists, much like during his debates with opponents in the disputed Iranian presidential election last year, Mr. Ahmadinejad has often been accused of making up statements wholesale.
But analysts noted that his remarks should be viewed through the prism of domestic politics in Iran, where conservatives try to outflank him. They said that during a recent Friday prayer sermon, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said that 84 percent of Americans believed their own government was behind the attacks.
Iran also cultivates an image as the voice of all Muslims in confronting the United States, and the idea that Americans rather than Islamic extremists carried out the 2001 attacks has long resonated among Arabs. ''This is very helpful to Ahmadinejad's desire for greatness in the Arab world,'' said Ali Mirsepassi, a professor of Middle Eastern studies and sociology at New York University.
The other two theories on the attacks presented by Mr. Ahmadinejad were that terrorists who penetrated American security were responsible, and that terrorists carried out the attacks but then the American government took advantage of the situation. He even suggested that the United Nations create a fact-finding panel to study the theories.
Farideh Farhi, an Iran expert at the University of Hawaii, said, ''Apparently now he has decided that by going to the core of American sensitivities -- in the same way he did with Israel by questioning the legitimacy of that country's existence -- he can continue to keep himself at the center of global attention while deflecting attention away from his dismal domestic record.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad also lambasted those Americans who had threatened to burn the Koran. ''The truth could not be burned,'' he said, hefting a green Koran aloft with his one hand and a black Bible with another, saying he respected both of them. ''We should wisely avoid playing into the hands of Satan.''
The other speeches Thursday followed more traditional lines, although not without moments of passion.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China focused his speech exclusively on China's domestic accomplishments, with a brief global reference at the end when he suggested a vital, peaceful China was good for the world's peace and prosperity.
The speech, entitled ''Getting to Know the Real China,'' lauded the country's economic progress while recognizing that it had a way to go with 150 million people still living in poverty. Mr. Wen said China was determined to forge even greater progress through education, science and technology.
The Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, endorsed American efforts to negotiate peace in the Middle East, but criticized Israel both for its presumed nuclear arsenal and for attacking a Turkish-organized humanitarian convoy at sea in May during which nine people were killed.
''We hope that this new engagement can take us closer to a viable and fair settlement,'' Mr. Gul said. ''On the other hand, it would be very difficult to make progress toward permanent peace unless we put an end to the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza.''
Mr. Gul called the attack a violation of international law, and he welcomed a report released Wednesday by United Nations Human Rights Council, which endorsed that viewpoint.President Bingu wa Mutharika of Malawi, speaking on behalf of the African Union, urged the General Assembly to defer for one year the war crimes charges brought by the International Criminal Court against President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan. He said that would avoid jeopardizing the outcome of a referendum scheduled for January on independence for southern Sudan.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A headline on Friday with an article about an incendiary speech in the United Nations General Assembly by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran summarized his remarks about the Sept. 11 terror attacks incorrectly. In his speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad asserted various theories about the origin of the attacks, including the possibility that they had been planned by the United States. He did not say that the United States had planned the attacks.

HEADLINE: Judge Accepts Citigroup's Settlement With S.E.C.

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge said Friday that she would accept the $75 million settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Citigroup over the bank's failure to adequately disclose its exposure to subprime mortgage debt in 2007.
But Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia told lawyers for the government that she wanted the S.E.C. to certify that the procedural remedies Citigroup claimed to have put in place to prevent a similar failure were adequate and would remain for a given period of time. 
''If you are so enamored of their proposals, I should have some assurance that they will be in place for a period of time and they will not change them,'' Judge Huvelle told the S.E.C.'s lawyer, Erica Y. Williams.
The judge also directed that the settlement agreement be reworded to make clear that the $75 million would be used to compensate shareholders who had suffered losses because of Citigroup's misstatements, and she told the S.E.C. and the bank to return in two weeks with new language that did that.
In issuing her opinion, Judge Huvelle both drew parallels and distinctions between the Citigroup case and the Bank of America case, which last year was the subject of a judicial review of an S.E.C. settlement. Unlike in the Bank of America case, she said, here the S.E.C. amassed adequate evidence of why the settlement amount made sense in light of how much the company had gained by its failure to disclose.
But, she added, the public deserved to know why the S.E.C. had said in its original complaint that ''senior management'' knew that the undisclosed subprime debt was contributing to losses but failed to charge any senior managers with securities violations beyond the chief financial officer and the director of investor relations.
Lawyers representing the S.E.C. and Citigroup argued that other senior managers had not been involved in the decision whether to disclose the subprime exposure and had not certified the federal filings that included the information.
Judge Huvelle acknowledged that she was bound to accept that decision. ''I have to defer to the expertise of the agency,'' she said. ''I have no control over who the S.E.C. charges or doesn't charge.''
The hearing resulted from the judge's review of a proposed settlement in the S.E.C.'s case against Citigroup arising from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and subsequent financial crisis. In July, the S.E.C. charged Citigroup with material misstatements of its exposure to subprime mortgages. The company advised investors in conference calls in 2007 that it held $13 billion in subprime investments when in fact it held more than $50 billion. In August, the judge declined to accept the proposed settlement and asked the parties to return with evidence of why it was adequate and why only two Citigroup executives had been charged with misconduct.
The commission also brought administrative proceedings against Gary L. Crittenden, the company's chief financial officer at the time of the misstatements, and Arthur Tildesley, then director of investor relations, for their roles in the wrongful disclosures. Mr. Crittenden agreed to pay $100,000 and Mr. Tildesley agreed to pay $80,000 as part of their settlements.
Judge Huvelle said that given the S.E.C.'s economic analysis in reaching the $75 million settlement, ''I can't really in good faith say that this figure is right or wrong.''
But, she added, ''there is nothing here to address the flawed systems'' that caused the company to so misstate its subprime exposure. None of the penalties were likely to prove to be an adequate deterrent, she added.
''Seventy-five million dollars will not deter anyone from doing anything,'' she said. Referring to the individual fines, ''a $100,000 fine is not a deterrent in corporate America to do a better job.''
Brad S. Karp, a lawyer representing Citigroup, sought to assure Judge Huvelle that the company had significant incentive not to violate securities laws, given that it had signed statements promising not to do so and noting that it had changed its entire senior management team since the events of 2007.
Mr. Karp added that because the evidence showed that Citigroup had not intentionally concealed its subprime exposure, ''Citi's heart was in the right place.''
''Don't overdo it,'' Judge Huvelle warned, evoking laughter in the courtroom. ''I've never seen Citigroup's heart. I've seen its building, but not its heart.''
The judge also said there was little value to having Citigroup executives sign statements that they would not violate securities laws. ''They're supposed to be obeying the law,'' she said, ''without writing it down.''

HEADLINE: A Shake-Up at HSBC, Known for a Steady Hand

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British banking giant HSBC Holdings said Friday that Michael Geoghegan had stepped down as chief executive after not being promoted to chairman, a surprise departure that has rattled a bank not generally known for boardroom intrigue.
Mr. Geoghegan will be succeeded on Jan. 1 by Stuart Gulliver, who runs HSBC's investment banking business, the bank said. Douglas Flint, the chief financial officer, will become chairman. 
While such sharp-elbowed tussles are common on Wall Street, they are unusual for HSBC, a tradition-bound global behemoth that dates back to the heyday of the British Empire. The shake-up is unlikely to affect the bank's strategy, which has been to move away from its disastrous foray into the American subprime mortgage market and expand its already substantial operations in Hong Kong, mainland China and elsewhere in Asia.
''It is not the most glorious episode in HSBC's history,'' said Glen P. Suarez of Knight Vinke, an HSBC shareholder and a critic of the bank's strategy in the United States. ''But Flint and Gulliver are experienced individuals. and it will all come down to execution.''
Mr. Geoghegan recently moved to Hong Kong to lead the bank's shift in focus toward Asia. He received credit for the bank's maintaining its profitability better than its peers during the financial crisis. But the ambitious and quick-tempered Mr. Geoghegan had resisted a decision by the board's succession committee to appoint the chairman of HSBC North America Holdings, John L. Thornton, as chairman, a move that would have broken a longstanding precedent of promoting the chief executive.
Over the last few months, Mr. Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs co-president who recently joined HSBC's American operations, had emerged as a leading candidate to take the chairman's job, which is based in London. The issue came to a head two weeks ago, when the current chairman, Stephen Green, stepped down to become the British trade minister, ending a 28-year career at the bank.
After difficulties in appointing a nonexecutive director, the board selected Mr. Flint, a well-regarded figure in London financial circles whose knowledge of the bank's finances made him an appealing choice for investors.
In a conference call, Mr. Green and Mr. Geoghegan disputed accounts that there had been a rift within the board and that Mr. Geoghegan was leaving because he could not become chairman. ''The truth is we had an organized process,'' Mr. Green said. ''I am dismayed that this was accompanied by speculation and leaks which were hurtful to those involved.''
Mr. Geoghegan said that Mr. Green's retirement ''triggered'' his own thinking, and he said he wanted to pass responsibility on to the ''next generation.'' He said that he had told people within the bank that he would only work five to six years as chief executive. He had held the post for four and a half years.
As to the question of whether he wanted to be chairman, Mr. Geoghegan said that ''I never went out of my way to be chairman, and the reality was that I was not asked.''
HSBC shares closed 0.4 percent higher Friday in London.
The changes are the latest in a series at London-based banks. Robert E. Diamond Jr. was named this month to succeed John Varley as chief executive of Barclays, and Eric Daniels, the chief executive of Lloyds, has said he will step down at the end of the year.
For the ever-striving Mr. Thornton, the near miss with HSBC was certainly a blow. Mr. Thornton left Goldman in 2003 after he was passed over for the top job. The HSBC chairmanship would have been a coup, giving him a substantial platform with one of the most global financial institutions.
While Mr. Gulliver is an investment banker by trade, he does not typify the risk-happy, larger-than-life mold set by Mr. Diamond, a prototype that has set teeth on edge in Britain amid concerns that Barclays would become beholden to the big bets taken by its bankers and traders.
In fact, since taking the helm of the bank's markets division in 2006, Mr. Gulliver has worked on aligning investment banking efforts with the group's broader focus of continuing to expand in emerging markets.
Mr. Gulliver, 51, a Briton who has worked at the bank since 1980, was paid $:9 million, or more than $14 million at current rates, in shares last year, along with base pay of $:826,000, making him the highest-paid banker at HSBC.
What remains unclear is the extent to which the boardroom divisions will heal. Mr. Thornton, in addition to his position in the United States, is a group director as well head of the remuneration committee, and it is unclear whether his having narrowly missed out on the job will affect his status.
Mr. Green said on Friday that there would be no changes at the board level, and he emphasized that the board was both satisfied and unanimous in its decision.

HEADLINE: We Haven't Hit Bottom Yet

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Wallingford, Conn.
Marcus Vogt is 20 years old and homeless. Or, as he puts it, ''I'm going through a couch-surfing phase.''
Mr. Vogt is a Wal-Mart employee but he was injured in a car accident and was unable to work for a couple of months. With no income and no health insurance, he quickly found himself unable to pay the rent. Even meals were hard to come by.
(His situation is quite a statement about real life in the United States in the 21st century. On the same day that I spoke with Mr. Vogt, Forbes magazine came out with its list of the 400 most outrageously rich Americans.) 
I met Mr. Vogt at Master's Manna, a food pantry and soup kitchen here that also offers a variety of other services to individuals and families that have fallen on hard times. He told me that his cellphone service has been cut off and he has more than $3,000 in medical bills outstanding. But he was cheerful and happy to report that he's back at work, although it will take at least a few more paychecks before he'll have enough money to rent a room.
Other folks who make their way to Master's Manna are not so upbeat. The Great Recession has long since ended, according to the data zealots in their windowless rooms. But it is still very real to the millions of men and women who wake up each morning to the grim reality of empty pockets and empty cupboards.
Wallingford is nobody's definition of a depressed community. It's a middle-class town on the Quinnipiac River. But the number of people seeking help at Master's Manna is rising, not falling. And when I asked Cheryl Bedore, who runs the program, if she was seeing more clients from the middle class, she said: ''Oh, absolutely. We have people who were donors in the past coming to our doors now in search of help.''
The political upheaval going on in the United States right now is being driven by the economic upheaval. It's sometimes hard to see this clearly amid the craziness and ugliness stirred up by the professional exploiters. But the essential issue is still the economy -- the rising tide of poor people and the decline of the middle class. The true extent of the pain has not been widely chronicled.
''The minute you open the doors, it's like a wave of desperation that's hitting you,'' said Ms. Bedore. ''People are depressed, despondent. They're on the edge, especially those who have never had to ask for help before.''
In recent weeks, a few homeless people with cars have been showing up at Master's Manna. Ms. Bedore has gotten permission from the local police department for them to park behind her building and sleep in their cars overnight. ''We've been recognized as a safe haven,'' she said.
In two of the cars, she said, were families with children.
It's not just joblessness that's driving people to the brink, although that's a big factor. It's underemployment, as well. ''For many of our families,'' said Ms. Bedore, ''the 40-hour workweek is over, a thing of the past. They may still have a job, but they're trying to survive on reduced hours -- with no benefits. Some are on forced furloughs.
''Once you start losing the income and you've run through your savings, then your car is up for repossession, or you're looking at foreclosure or eviction. We're a food pantry, but hunger is only the tip of the iceberg. Life becomes a constant juggling act when the money starts running out. Are you going to pay for your medication? Or are you going to put gas in the car so you can go to work?
''Kids are going back to school now, so they need clothes and school supplies. Where is the money for that to come from? The people we're seeing never expected things to turn out like this -- not at this stage of their lives. Not in the United States. The middle class is quickly slipping into a lower class.''
Similar stories -- and worse -- are unfolding throughout the country. There are more people in poverty now -- 43.6 million -- than at any time since the government began keeping accurate records. Nearly 15 million Americans are out of work and home foreclosures are expected to surpass one million this year. The Times had a chilling front-page article this week about the increasing fear among jobless workers over 50 that they will never be employed again.
The politicians seem unable to grasp the immensity of the problem, which is why the policy solutions are so woefully inadequate. During my conversations with Ms. Bedore, she dismissed the very thought that the recession might be over. ''Whoever said that was sadly mistaken,'' she said. ''We haven't even bottomed-out yet.''

HEADLINE: Afghan Equality and Law, But With Strings Attached

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- It was an engaging idea.
Hundreds of children would gather on the iconic Nader Khan Hill in the capital, Kabul, on a gorgeous Friday in September and fly kites emblazoned with slogans lauding the rule of law and equality for women. The kites, along with copies of the Afghan Constitution and justice-themed comic books, would be gifts of the United States, part of a $35 million effort ''to promote the use of Afghanistan's formal justice system.''
''The mere portrait of 500 kites soaring in the winds, against a backdrop of beautiful mountain ranges, is enough to instill hope in even the most disheartened observer of the war-torn country,'' said a promotional release for the festival, organized by an American contractor for the United States Agency for International Development. 
What could possibly go wrong?
Almost everything but the wind.
For starters, Afghan policemen hijacked the event, stealing dozens of kites for themselves and beating children with sticks when they crowded too close to the kite distribution tent. To be fair, the children were a little unruly, but they were also small.
Sometimes the officers just threatened them with sticks, and other times slapped them in the face or whacked them with water bottles. ''I told them to stop the policemen from taking the kites,'' said Shakila Faqeeri, a communications adviser for the contractor, DPK Consulting.
But the policemen appeared to ignore her. Asked why one of his officers was loading his truck with kites, Maj. Farouk Wardak, head of the criminal investigation division of the 16th Police District, said, ''It's okay, he's not just a policeman, he's my bodyguard.''
The District 16 police chief, Col. Haji Ahmad Fazli, insisted on taking over from the American contractors the job of passing out the kites. He denied that his men were kite thieves. ''We are not taking them,'' he said. ''We are flying them ourselves.''
At least he had not lost sight of the event's goal. ''It is so people can understand the rule of law, and it lets the kids get together instead of wandering on the streets,'' he said.
It was not clear that the children had a much better grasp of the concept, but some did manage to get kites and were flying them, irregularly shaped patches of color soaring to impressive heights.
Most bore messages about the importance of gender equality, but there was hardly a girl with a kite, although plenty of girls were around. One DPK staff member pushed through the crowd to give 10-year-old Shaqila Nabi a kite; her sister Farzana, 8, had wanted one, too, but a policeman had just swung at her with a stick and she had darted out of harm's way, and out of sight.
Shaqila raced back to her father, Gul Nabi, a horse wrangler peddling rides. He promptly took the kite and gave it to a boy.
''He is my son and he should get the kite,'' he said.
The law and justice comic books were also a big hit. Some of the boys snatched them up and hid them under their shirts so they could come back for more. At one point, fed-up policemen, most of whom cannot read, just tossed piles of them in the dirt.
Mike Sheppard, the DPK project head, pronounced the event a success. ''We just gave out a thousand kites in 20 minutes,'' he said.
But another DPK staff member, Abdul Manem Danish, stood watching the kite thievery and casual police brutality with disdain. His job was to administer a ''kite event effectiveness survey'' at the end to see if the festival had affected anyone's attitudes about justice.
''That's not a very good example of rule of law,'' he said. ''Maybe it is the nature of these people that needs to be changed.''

HEADLINE: Vans on the Run

BYLINE: By ELLIOTT SCLAR and ROBERT E. PAASWELL. 
Elliott Sclar is a professor of urban planning and the director of the Center for Sustainable Urban Development at Columbia. Robert E. Paaswell is a professor of civil engineering at the City College of New York.

 BODY:
IN the face of drastic cuts in the Metropolitan Transit Authority's bus service, the Bloomberg administration recently decided to allow private vans to carry passengers along several routes in Brooklyn and Queens where city buses once ran. One company began service earlier this month, and four more will be operating by October.
The vans, licensed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission, are meant to be a quick solution to the service cuts caused by the transit authority's $800 million budget gap. But relying on a private-sector solution to a public-sector shortfall will also incur significant social costs and possibly doom Mr. Bloomberg's long-term vision for New York's transportation system. 
If you've ever spent time in a city in the developing world, chances are you've experienced a transit system that relies almost entirely on private commuter services. Thanks to low barriers to market entry -- often anyone with a working van or bus can pick up passengers -- the streets are clogged with a motley assortment of vans and buses, few of them in optimal working condition. The results are, not surprisingly, higher levels of pollution and more accidents and traffic fatalities than in cities with strictly regulated public services.
Mr. Bloomberg and the Taxi and Limousine Commission have offered assurances that better regulations will keep the city from becoming an American Calcutta or Rio de Janeiro. But that's an easy promise to make, and probably an empty one: New York's experiences with crane and building-code regulations demonstrates that enforcement usually costs more than policymakers are willing to spend, especially in lean fiscal times.
Indeed, even though the van companies are already operating on the former bus routes, the Taxi and Limousine Commission has not added enough personnel to cover its new regulatory responsibilities. (It's worth asking why, if such funds were available, the city shouldn't reinstate some of the bus routes instead).
Moreover, history and recent experience shows that when it comes to poorly regulated private-service providers, informal cartels often step in to provide their own ''regulation'' -- a problem that the city's original taxi regulations, adopted in the 1930s, were created to prevent. Such cartels, whether organized by the owners themselves or by enterprising local gangs, can easily turn to bribery and even physical violence to keep competition out.
And once in place, informal services like commuter vans, controlled by powerful operators, can become difficult to dislodge, thanks to the political influence they wield. Consider the situation in Johannesburg: the city was able to open its new bus system only after the government agreed to pay about $7,000 for each private taxi it displaced.
Private transit service will also incur social costs. For starters, because the new vans don't accept MetroCards, passengers who want to transfer from them to a public bus or train have to pay twice -- a significant burden for residents with modest incomes who live along the affected routes.
Second, relying on private service means replacing well-paying transit employees with a lower-paid and typically untaxed labor force. Private van operators have reported working 14-hour days, seven days a week, for about $200 in daily pay -- before maintenance expenses. These drivers have no health insurance, retirement or disability benefits. Adding more informal workers to the New York work force, even as the number of public employees is decreased, is no way to build a robust local economy.
Finally, increased dependence on fragmented transit service could be an obstacle to Mayor Bloomberg's environmental agenda, PlaNYC 2030, a vision for the next 20 years that relies heavily on an expanded and well-integrated public transit system to all parts of the city. Lobbying by newly entrenched private operators would likely pressure the city to retain inefficient parts of the status quo -- to their benefit and at the public's expense.
True, the Bloomberg administration considers private transit services a temporary solution, to end as soon as the money to restart the affected routes is found. But City Hall needs to adopt a clear end date and make a meaningful investment in rigorous public regulation, including oversight and inspection, to ensure high-quality labor and vehicle standards.
On the other hand, if the operations are to continue indefinitely, then they need to be quickly integrated into the Metropolitan Transit Authority system, with MetroCard connectivity.
Above all, City Hall needs to recognize that when it comes to public programs, seemingly convenient stopgap measures can easily take on a pernicious life of their own. If it doesn't, one of the nation's most forward-thinking mayors will be responsible for taking his city's transit system back into the past.

HEADLINE: As Aging B.Q.E. Faces Reconstruction, Ideas Turn to Tunnels

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Like many New Yorkers, the people of Brooklyn Heights have something of a love-hate relationship with the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
On the one hand, the highway is the bane of the neighborhood, carrying trucks whose startling rumbles often wake the sleeping, and spewing dust and fumes onto leafy streets named Cranberry, Pineapple and Willow. But it also props up the neighborhood's most celebrated landmark -- the Promenade, with its picturesque views of the Lower Manhattan skyline.
Whatever ambivalence people have, the highway is growing old and frail. After more than 55 years of grinding wear and tear, the mile-and-a-half elbow that curves around Brooklyn Heights must be overhauled. And so, the brownstone neighborhood -- one of the city's most genteel, but not its gentlest when it comes to political combat -- is bristling with talk about how, exactly, that should be done without clogging traffic even more. 
Much of the conversation has focused on tunnels, proposed at supersize lengths New Yorkers have not seen since the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel was opened in 1950. Three separate ideas for tunnels running parallel to the existing elevated roadway were put forward in recent months by the State Transportation Department.
The rationale for the project was to create a bypass while the B.Q.E. -- notorious for its lack of shoulders, impossibly short merge lanes and low clearances -- is almost completely rebuilt. A tunnel, though, would live on to relieve congestion on one of the city's most heavily traveled routes, which now carries 140,000 vehicles a day. Early state estimates -- before the idea of a tunnel was formally broached -- put the cost of the entire project at $254 million and predicted construction would begin in summer 2017.
A fourth tunnel idea that would skip Brooklyn Heights entirely has been put forward by a local graphic designer, Roy Sloane. He would bore an almost three-mile tube straight under the heart of Brooklyn, from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, below the streets of Fort Greene, Boerum Hill and Park Slope, to emerge at a spot near the southern end of Red Hook. Mr. Sloane presented the idea to state transportation officials at one of the brainstorming sessions they have scheduled every month for residents.
''Why not think big?'' Mr. Sloane said. ''Engineers tell me that the most elegant solution to any problem is a straight line.''
Given the difficulty of financing and completing environmental reviews for large projects like the Second Avenue subway line and the remade World Trade Center, the idea of a long tunnel sounds utopian, particularly in a listless economy. Nevertheless, Adam Levine, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, said the agency had asked its engineers to consider all the alternatives. The next meeting with residents and other stakeholders will be on Wednesday.
The opinions of activists in Brooklyn Heights often carry a substantial weight with officials. After all, the creation of the Promenade itself and the selection of a route that passed around, rather than through, the brownstone neighborhood, were among the concessions they extracted from the master highway builder Robert Moses before the highway opened in 1954.
Mr. Sloane, 60, who lives in Cobble Hill and was one of the early advocates for the park that has been rising along the Brooklyn waterfront, said a tunnel would allow trucks and cars that have no intention of visiting Downtown Brooklyn to steer clear of the neighborhood, saving gas and as much as half an hour in travel time. The elevated expressway would then be reinvented as a feeder route only for those who want to get off at Brooklyn Heights or other Downtown streets.
Any tunnel through Downtown Brooklyn would have to be dug deeper than the multitude of subway tunnels, cables and gas lines that already crisscross the area. Mr. Sloane pointed out there would also have to be enough space at the entrances to accommodate a gently angled slope. And a tunnel would also have to have mammoth ventilation structures, which could mean taking some land.
''I'm not an engineer, I'm an imagineer,'' Mr. Sloane said whimsically.
Most of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which stretches from below the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge (formerly the Triborough) to the northern end of the Gowanus Expressway near Green-Wood Cemetery, has already been upgraded. But the portion through Brooklyn Heights presents a particular challenge. It contains a section, less than half a mile long, that is a triple-cantilever, an engineering marvel of reinforced concrete in which beams are supported at only one end. There are three westbound lanes on one level, three eastbound lanes on another and the Promenade atop them both.
Any satisfactory rehabilitation would have to wrestle with the B.Q.E.'s original sins -- narrow lanes (10 1/2 feet compared with the 12-foot federal standard), short merges at the on-ramps that lead to periodic collisions, and clearances too low for recent generations of trucks. Taller trucks now have to leave the expressway and make their way through the neighborhood's streets, creating a noisy, rattling irritant. And its lack of shoulders means the highway gets star billings on radio traffic reports.
''If one guy has a flat tire, 10,000 people are late to work,'' is the way Mr. Sloane describes the problem.
At one point, the state, hoping to widen the highway, advanced the possibility of taking over some brownstones through eminent domain and tearing them down, but that notion is said to be off the table. On a stroll through the neighborhood, Jane Carroll McGroarty, an architect who is president of the Brooklyn Heights Association, pointed out the heritage that could be disrupted by insensitive highway plans, including homes where W. H. Auden, Thomas Wolfe, Carson McCullers and Arthur Miller lived, and the church whose preacher was abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher, brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''
While wanting more details, the association seems more than open to the idea of a tunnel -- to such an extent that all they would like kept of the current highway is the Promenade.
''We were saying, 'Do the tunnel and get rid of the B.Q.E. totally,' '' Ms. McGroarty said.

HEADLINE: Told to Eat Its Vegetables, America Orders Fries

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
It's been a busy week for vegetables.
The baby-carrot industry tried to reposition its product as junk food, starting a $25 million advertising campaign whose defining characteristics include heavy metal music, a phone app and a young man in a grocery cart dodging baby-carrot bullets fired by a woman in tight jeans.
On the East Side of Manhattan, crates of heirloom vegetables with names like Lady Godiva squash were auctioned for $1,000 each at Sotheby's, where the wealthy are more accustomed to bidding on Warhols and Picassos than turnips and tomatoes.
Both efforts, high and low, are aimed at the same thing: getting America to eat its vegetables. 
Good luck. Despite two decades of public health initiatives, stricter government dietary guidelines, record growth of farmers' markets and the ease of products like salad in a bag, Americans still aren't eating enough vegetables.
This month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a comprehensive nationwide behavioral study of fruit and vegetable consumption. Only 26 percent of the nation's adults eat vegetables three or more times a day, it concluded. (And no, that does not include French fries.)
These results fell far short of health objectives set by the federal government a decade ago. The amount of vegetables Americans eat is less than half of what public health officials had hoped. Worse, it has barely budged since 2000.
''It is disappointing,'' said Dr. Jennifer Foltz, a pediatrician who helped compile the report. She, like other public health officials dedicated to improving the American diet, concedes that perhaps simply telling people to eat more vegetables isn't working.
''There is nothing you can say that will get people to eat more veggies,'' said Harry Balzer, the chief industry analyst for the NPD Group, a market research company.
This week, the company released the 25th edition of its annual report, ''Eating Patterns in America.'' The news there wasn't good, either. For example, only 23 percent of meals include a vegetable, Mr. Balzer said. (Again, fries don't count, but lettuce on a hamburger does.) The number of dinners prepared at home that included a salad was 17 percent; in 1994, it was 22 percent.
At restaurants, salads ordered as a main course at either lunch or dinner dropped by half since 1989, to a mere 5 percent, he said.
The nation has long had a complicated relationship with vegetables. People know that vegetables can improve health. But they're a lot of work. In refrigerators all over the country, produce often dies a slow, limp death because life becomes too busy.
''The moment you have something fresh you have to schedule your life around using it,'' Mr. Balzer said.
In the wrong hands, vegetables can taste terrible. And compared with a lot of food at the supermarket, they're a relatively expensive way to fill a belly.
''Before we want health, we want taste, we want convenience and we want low cost,'' Mr. Balzer said.
Melissa MacBride, a busy Manhattan resident who works for a pharmaceuticals company, would eat more vegetables if they weren't, in her words, ''a pain.''
''An apple you can just grab,'' she said. ''But what am I going to do, put a piece of kale in my purse?''
No one really wants to admit that they don't eat vegetables. A nurse who works at the Hospital for Special Surgery on the Upper East Side openly acknowledges that vegetables make her gag. Still, she begged to not be publicly identified because she is in the health care field and knows that she should set a better example.
David Bernstein, who lives in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is sheepish about the lack of vegetables in his diet. He waits tables at the hip M. Wells restaurant in Long Island City, Queens, and knows his way around the Union Square Greenmarket. But his diet consists largely of bacon, yogurt and frozen stuffed chicken breasts.
''It's just like any other bad habit,'' he said. ''Part of it is just that vegetables are a little intimidating. I'm not afraid of zucchinis, but I just don't know how to cook them.''
The food industry has tried to make eating vegetables easier. Sales of convenience vegetables, like packages of cut broccoli designed to go right into the microwave, are growing. Washed, ready-to-eat bagged salads are a $3-billion-a-year business.
But that doesn't necessarily mean people are eating more vegetables. It just means they are shifting their vegetable budget from one place to another, Mr. Balzer said. An organic cucumber might replace a conventionally grown one. A bag of lettuce replaces a head.
To be sure, vegetables are making strides in certain circles. Women, as well as people who are older and more educated and have higher incomes, tend to eat more vegetables, said Dr. Foltz, the pediatrician who worked on the C.D.C. report.
The vegetable, especially when grown from heirloom seeds on small farms, is held in such high esteem that knowing the farmer who grows the food is a form of valuable social currency. Vegetables are becoming high art. At Sotheby's on Thursday night, the vegetable auction was part of a daylong event called ''The Art of Farming,'' raising nearly $250,000 to help hunger organizations, immigrant farmers and children without access to vegetables.
But vegetables are also becoming important on the other end of the economic equation. An increasing number of the nation's 6,000 farmers' markets allow shoppers to buy produce with food stamps. Urban gardens are springing up in vacant lots and on rooftops. Nearly every state now has programs that send fresh vegetables into poorer neighborhoods and school cafeterias.
The vegetable even has the first lady, Michelle Obama, on its side. She planted an organic garden on the White House lawn and talks up vegetables as part of her ''Let's Move'' campaign against childhood obesity.
The government keeps trying, too, to get its message across. It now recommends four and a half cups of fruits and vegetables (that's nine servings) for people who eat 2,000 calories a day. Some public health advocates have argued that when the guidelines are updated later this year, they should be made even clearer. One proposal is to make Americans think about it visually, filling half the plate or bowl with vegetables.
But clear guidance probably isn't enough. Health officials now concede that convincing a nation that shuns vegetables means making vegetables more affordable and more available.
''We have to make the healthy choice the easy choice,'' Dr. Foltz said. And the choices need to become ingrained.
For another study whose results were announced this week, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, spent three years examining the difference between children who participated in the Berkeley Unified School District's ''edible schoolyard'' program, in which gardening and cooking are woven into the school day, and children who didn't.
The students who gardened ate one and half servings more of vegetables a day than those who weren't in the program.
For students who don't have access to a school garden, perhaps the full-court press by the baby-carrot producers will have some effect. The iPhone application, for example, is a video game called Xtreme Xrunch Kart that starts when a player crunches a carrot (or makes a crunchlike sound) into the phone's microphone.
But as in past attempts to revive the vegetable, none of this will necessarily be enough to change a clear aversion to eating vegetables.
''Eating vegetables is a lot less fun than eating flavor-blasted Doritos,'' said Marcia Mogelonsly, a senior analyst for Mintel, a global marketing firm. ''You will always have to fight that.''

HEADLINE: Recessions and Recoveries Are Not All the Same

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
In the old days -- before 1990 -- American recessions tended to be fairly sharp. But the recoveries, when they came, were also rapid. Laid-off workers were recalled and consumers who had deferred purchases out of fear they might lose their jobs were willing again to buy cars and homes.
The newer version of recessions -- in 1990-91 and 2001 -- provided shallower downturns. But the aftermath was also slow and painful. They came to be known as jobless recoveries. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research determined this week that the recession that began in December 2007 ended in June 2009. That made it the longest downturn since World War II, and data had already shown it was the deepest in terms of decline in gross domestic product.
And now that we know the recovery is more than a year old, it appears that this cycle is combining the worst of both worlds: deep fall followed by slow recovery.
There are many reasons for that, and some exceptions to the pattern. Manufacturing appears to be recovering faster than it did after the two recent recessions. But construction, which had boomed to a greater extent than ever earlier in this decade, remains more depressed than usual.
The accompanying charts compare various aspects of the last four recessions -- the two followed by slow recoveries and the last of the old type, as well as the latest downturn.
The lines all begin with the official beginning of the recession, allowing an easy comparison of how much worse that particular aspect of the economy became as the recession went on. The ending months of each recession are shown at the same point, making it easy to see how severe the downturn was and how rapid the recovery.
There are some aspects of this cycle that have no direct precedent. One is the performance of service industries. For most of the years after World War II, the United States economy became more and more oriented toward service jobs, and both employment and spending rose, whatever the state of the rest of the economy. But this time service businesses suffered, and they have been slow to recover.
That is particularly true for the industry that bears the most blame for the recession -- financial services. The big banks were bailed out -- Lehman Brothers excepted -- but employment fell sharply during the recession and has continued to decline.
Another area that is weaker than in previous recoveries is the condition of state and local governments. Working for them was always considered safe, if not particularly rewarding. Neither of the two recessions before the latest one had any significant impact on those jobs.
But in this cycle, governments are facing severe budget shortfalls, and layoffs are accelerating.
In the private sector, there have been some signs of recovery in jobs, but those signs are faint. Instead, employers are getting more work out of the workers they have. Total hours worked are rising much more rapidly than total jobs.
That could be a sign of better times ahead. There are limits to how many extra hours are available, so the pressures to hire more people may be growing in some industries.
If those pressures do grow, there is no shortage of people who need work. The unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high, and the long-term unemployment rate -- defined as the proportion of the labor force out of work for at least 15 weeks -- rose to levels not reached since the government started compiling the figures in 1948. It has slipped a bit since peaking in April, but remains higher than during any previous cycle.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Most of the charts are indexed from the level in the month the recession ended, and show how the figures changed during the recession and in the two years after it ended. Each line begins in the month the recession officially began. The service economy takes a hit

HEADLINE: Congregations Face Financial Trials as Giving Declines

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgf1@columbia.edu

 BODY:
Late this summer, as the country's economic slump entered its third year, Bishop Robert E. Girtman met with the board of his church to discuss finances. The weekly collection of tithes and offerings, routinely $4,000 before the recession, had sunk to barely $3,000. Some members, newly jobless and ashamed, turned in tithing envelopes that were empty. Others skipped church a few Sundays a month to avoid the awkwardness of having nothing to give.
So the question for Bishop Girtman and his board at the Church of the Living God in Port Chester, N.Y., a suburb of New York City, was how to respond. They could run fund-raising events. They could hire fewer gospel musicians. Or, as one board member told the pastor, they could just face facts and stop asking for donations for a year, praying that by then the economy might be healthy. 
''I was shocked off my chair,'' Bishop Girtman, 67, recalled in a phone interview this week. ''Because how, then, would the church live? You have the lights and the heat and all the other bills that go on.''
Beyond the momentary jolt lay a broader realization, no less distressing. ''I've seen recessions in the past when people didn't give as much,'' said Bishop Girtman, who has pastored the Pentecostal church for 30 years. ''But I have not seen one like this before. People are cutting the church out, trying to make ends meet at home to pay their rent, their bills. People are just in financial straits.''
The experience at Bishop Girtman's church echoes across the congregational landscape of America. From storefront chapels to Sun Belt megachurches to suburban synagogues, across denominational lines, religious institutions are reeling from a decline in donations.
The National Cathedral in Washington, the most prominent Episcopal church in the United States, has made four rounds of staff layoffs since 2008. The Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Calif., an archetypal evangelical megachurch, has laid off staff members, sold property, and been sued by creditors. In the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, the 55-member Primera Iglesia Getsemani, its monthly intake falling to $400 from $900, is surviving by running a weekly flea market on its sidewalk.
While the recession has sharpened the drop in giving, it is not entirely responsible for it. Rather, it has accentuated and accelerated a trend away from giving to religious organizations that scholars have been tracking for the past decade. The impending wave of retirements by baby boomers, who start hitting age 65 next year, threatens another blow to congregational income.
''When the foundation falls, when the base isn't there, then you have problems,'' said Elbert T. Chester, an accountant in Queens who has more than 60 churches along the Eastern Seaboard as clients. ''And we haven't even seen the worst of it.''
Well before the subprime mortgage crisis threw the economy into a tailspin, warning signs for religious giving were present. A 2007 study by three professors at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis found that baby boomers in 2000 were donating about 10 percent less to religious bodies than their parents' generation did at a comparable age in 1973 -- and almost 25 percent less than those parents, by then ages 62 to 76, were donating in 2000.
As for what explains the generational divide, scholars of philanthropy offer several explanations. Charles E. Zech, a professor of economics at Villanova University outside Philadelphia, cites ''cohort theory.'' The so-called Greatest Generation came of age during the New Deal and World War II, developing trust in institutions, he said. The baby boomers, in contrast, learned skepticism as products of the Vietnam and Watergate years.
In religious terms, that wariness of institutions has meant that boomers are more likely to construct a personal sense of spirituality than to subscribe to a denominational or even congregational one. Arnold M. Eisen and Stephen M. Cohen persuasively showed the trend among American Jews in their 2000 book, ''The Jew Within.''
''It's wrong to look at this as a money problem,'' said Mark Ottoni-Wilhelm, a professor of economics at Indiana-Purdue who was a co-author of its study. ''The drop in giving follows the involvement pattern. Because people aren't as involved, the giving pattern traces it.''
Unquestionably, though, the recession worsened the trend. Before the economic crisis hit, according to a study of 1,500 congregations by the Lake Institute on Faith and Giving, half saw an increase in annual donations and about 20 percent registered a decline. In 2009, the first full year of recession, the percentage with smaller donations almost doubled, and only one-third of congregations reported higher giving.
Mr. Chester, the accountant, said that donations had fallen at two-thirds of his client churches, anywhere from 25 to 50 percent from the pre-recession levels. ''They'll reduce missions, cut salaries, make layoffs just to pay the mortgage,'' he said. ''Even our fees are slow in coming in. Before, it was one, two, three. Now it's like pulling teeth.''
Rabbi Gerald L. Zelizer, who has led Congregation Neve Shalom in Metuchen, N.J., since 1970, described a phenomenon of financial extremes. On one hand, more than 50 families out of a total of 580 in his congregation this year asked for their annual dues to be reduced. On the other hand, several large donors in the congregation, knowing of its budgetary struggle, increased their contributions to the annual fund, which rose to $67,000 from $53,000 over the past year.
Still, with what Rabbi Zelizer calls the ''graying'' of Conservative Jewish congregations, and a ''growing disinterest in organized religion,'' a few philanthropic angels cannot provide a long-term solution.
''This is a different dip than we've ever had before,'' he said. ''You have to work harder to overcome this. The mountain is steeper.''

HEADLINE: Cracking the Window to Cool Air And the Clamor From a Bar Patio

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
As the numbingly hot and airless days of summer have given way to the cool snap of fall, New Yorkers have been spilling back outdoors for a drink at a backyard patio or rooftop lounge.
But for residents like Paul Raschilla, whose house abuts the patio of Lounge 47 in Long Island City, Queens, all those raised lycheetinis and microbrews push the emotional thermostat higher.
''People just get a load on as they do at any bar,'' Mr. Raschilla, 41, said of the crowds that gather from afternoon until night, ''but the fact that they're right under a bedroom window, right outside my kitchen window, with the kind of loud behavior and cursing that goes on -- I've got the baby in my arms, saying, 'Hey, could you please keep it down?' and they say, 'Oh, well, why don't you move?' ''
In a city so dense that private life often plays out just a razor's edge from public revelry, Mr. Raschilla, an engineer who lives on the same block where he grew up, is far from alone in his complaints. As New Yorkers turn off air-conditioners and fling open windows to the sounds of the city, many are being driven to distraction by noise from rooftop and patio bars that go largely unregulated. 
Unlike sidewalk cafes, whose design and operating hours are strictly controlled by the city, off-street eating and drinking spaces need only the approval of the State Liquor Authority, as part of an establishment's overall liquor license. So if the indoor bar can legally keep serving until 4 a.m., the outdoor bar can, too.
Michael Jones, the Liquor Authority's deputy chief executive in the city, has the tricky job of balancing the desires of the neighbors with the needs of restaurants, where the money pulled in by an outdoor operation can keep a business alive, especially after a recession-era winter like the last one.
''They have a right to run a business,'' Mr. Jones said, ''and the community has a right to have quiet and the ability to sleep at night.''
Now the sleepless are taking matters into their own hands. Last month, a state appellate court agreed with a co-op next to the Empire Hotel, near Lincoln Center, that music from its rooftop bar was ''unreasonable and affected the residents' right to use and enjoy their respective apartments.'' A remedy has yet to be determined.
State lawmakers are stepping in, too. The Legislature enacted a law this summer making it easier for the Liquor Authority to revoke a bar's license if the police are called there at least six times in 60 days. And Assemblywoman Joan L. Millman of Brooklyn introduced legislation that would require restaurants and bars to secure a special license for backyard or rooftop spaces; those operations would have to close by 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and by 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, unless the local community board approved extended hours.
In the meantime, community boards, which make nonbinding recommendations that they say the Liquor Authority has tended to follow in recent months, have become more aggressive. Increasingly, they have advised that applications be denied or have earlier closing hours negotiated for the outdoor spaces.
''We try very hard to discourage applicants from using rear yards,'' said Jo Hamilton, chairwoman of Manhattan Community Board 2, which governs some of the city's most congested nightlife destinations, including NoLIta, Greenwich Village and the meatpacking district. If the applicants go ahead anyway, Ms. Hamilton said, the board at least tries to make them hew to the hours of sidewalk cafes, which generally must close by midnight on weeknights and by 1 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
But residents say that those stipulations are difficult to enforce. Neighbors can call the police, but by the time they arrive the noise may have quieted, or officers may not be aware that the bar has agreed to close early.
''It's not against the law to be open at 3 o'clock in the morning, but if there's a stipulation, that would violate our regulations,'' said Mr. Jones, the Liquor Authority official. ''The police can't really do anything, but they can tell us.''
Even then, it can take more than a year to revoke a liquor license if the threat to the public is not considered dire, like violent crime or drug dealing, Mr. Jones said.
That has fueled frustration in many corners of the city, especially downtown Manhattan, where community board meetings sometimes stretch late into the night as established and aspiring restaurateurs plead their cases and residents rally to block their applications. Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, recently descended on a meeting to prevent Miss Lily's, a Jamaican restaurant, from moving to Houston Street in the West Village and opening a terrace space near the backyard of her town house.
These frictions begin anew each year, as the first hint of spring nudges bar patrons to head outside and neighbors to open windows, according to data from the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. The number of 311 noise complaints tends to spike in May, then dip, as it did this June, when it grew hot enough that people fled to air-conditioning. The calls pick up again as temperatures drop.
Long Island City, a once-quiet neighborhood where mixed-use zoning has allowed restaurants, bars and clubs to proliferate, has followed this pattern; complaints for the first half of this year were up 44 percent from 2009, with the overwhelming majority in March, April and May. Lounge 47, a neighborhood hangout that is hardly among the city's rowdiest, has become a lightning rod for many of the tensions surrounding the area's revitalization.
One of the first places along Vernon Boulevard to stay open late and cater to the younger residents moving in, the lounge quickly drew the ire of neighbors when it opened the backyard patio six years ago. Now, in an area where waterfront towers and condominium buildings loom over brick- and vinyl-clad houses, it is part of a four-block stretch north of 50th Street that has about 20 establishments.
Fans of the bar say its owner has shown good faith, agreeing in recent months to close the patio by 10 p.m. on weeknights and midnight on weekends.
''The crowds that have come to the area -- artsy people, interesting people, it's just a really good mix -- wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the towers that have gone up and the restaurants and bars,'' said Niall Carolan, who managed the lounge until recently. ''Sometimes things get boisterous and there are some expletives used, but these things happen in bars.''
Neighbors say the bar has not done enough to make patrons understand their concerns. Even a little noise -- a moderate conversation, the occasional guffaw -- can shatter the peace inside nearby homes once it has bounced off the surrounding brick and concrete walls.
One resident, William Garrett, a sound engineer who said he was reluctant to comment for this article because the fight had become too personal, has been waging his own war to get Lounge 47 shut down, posting videos of late-night smoking, drinking and cursing on YouTube.
How it will end is anyone's guess. The Liquor Authority has been weighing disciplinary action for past violations, and Mr. Jones said there was ''credible evidence'' that the bar was not living up to its agreement.
Mr. Raschilla, meanwhile, said he and his neighbors would continue to be frustrated by life on the banks of a watering hole.
''My life should not be a sideshow -- 'Oh look, they've got the lights on. I wonder what they're making for dinner,' '' he said. ''I think they could do a better job of educating the people who come in that once they're in the back, they're part of a community.''

HEADLINE: Written Off, Not Paid Off

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The substantial drop in credit card debt in the United States since early 2009 has been widely attributed to newly frugal consumers. But analysts say that a significant portion of the decline is actually the result of financial institutions writing off billions of dollars in credit card debt as losses.
While consumers have done their part by shying away from exceeding new credit limits and turning increasingly to debit cards, the question is to what extent are consumers voluntarily reducing their balances, and to what extent are banks making the decision for them.
The answer has wide implications for the broader economy as banks try to determine whom to extend credit to -- and how much -- and as businesses try to adapt to the changes in consumers' spending patterns. 
''There is a lot of debate going on right now among economists,'' said Cristian deRitis, the director of credit analytics with Moody's Analytics, which is studying the issue. ''Is there truly deleveraging or are charge-offs removing a lot of balances?''
Kenneth J. Clayton, senior vice president for the American Bankers Association for card policy, said the impact of tighter credit was working its way through an economy in which consumers continue to feel the effects of joblessness, lower incomes and declining housing values. ''It has a braking effect on the economy, and the key thing is to get to the right balance,'' he said. ''We are in a process right now of finding that balance.''
Consumer debt has been steadily falling over the last couple of years. The Federal Reserve said last week that household liabilities -- including mortgages, credit card accounts and nonrevolving accounts like auto loans -- totaled $13.9 trillion in the second quarter of 2010, down $200 billion from the same quarter a year earlier.
Outstanding revolving accounts, mostly credit cards, declined to $832.2 billion from $915 billion in that same period, the Fed said in a separate report earlier in the month.
But economists said they were trying to calculate how much of the drop in credit card debt was the result of banks writing it off -- charging off, in bank parlance.
Mr. deRitis, of Moody's, said he was examining the credit card accounts of individual borrowers. He said he expected to learn which borrowers were voluntarily paying down their debt, which were taking on new debt, and to what extent existing borrowers were curtailing balances by paying more than the minimum.
While the study is not yet complete, Mr. deRitis said it appeared so far that most of the overall decline is in the form of charge-offs.
''There clearly is a differential impact with defaulting borrowers having greater difficulty finding credit in the future,'' he said. ''Nondefaulting borrowers are reducing their overall credit exposures but not at an especially rapid pace, given stagnant incomes and wealth.''
''Bottom line -- we are becoming more of a polarized set of consumers,'' Mr. deRitis added.
A study released last week by Evolution Finance's CardHub.com, calculated that financial institutions charged off about $20 billion each quarter from early 2009 through early 2010, about equal to the amount of the decline in outstanding credit card debt.
''This study's findings give real insight into how seriously the recession crippled consumers with credit card balances,'' said Odysseas Papadimitriou, the company's chief executive. ''These write-offs also indicate that many banks are still experiencing deep losses and are still in serious trouble.''
But Gregory Daco, a senior economist with IHS Global Insight, said that the revolving debt figures alone did not explain consumer behavior. He said the Fed figures showed that consumers were clearing their balance sheets of various kinds of debt -- mortgages, revolving debt for credit cards and nonrevolving debt like car loans.
Still, Mr. Daco said, the numbers only ''give you an overview of the consumer credit picture.''
''You don't know,'' he said, ''the exact proportion of how much people are actually paying off. It is a fact that part of the downward trend in consumer credit is due to charge-offs, but it doesn't give you a clear answer as to what are the main underlying causes of that. And the best way is to refer to anecdotal evidence.''
Analysts said they had found that consumers who once relied on home equity are shuffling their finances, with some not paying their mortgage and using the temporary increase in liquidity to pay off credit cards, which they can then use again and again for daily necessities.
The consequences of that behavior play out in offices like that of Urmi Mukherjee, a financial counselor in Kansas. She had a client who ''had to make a decision between paying the mortgage and paying credit card debt,'' she said. ''We see it very often.''
Ezra Becker, a director in the financial services business unit of TransUnion, a credit information company, said any bank that ignored shifts in consumer behavior did so at its peril. That behavior, he said, ''needs to inform lender policy or lender strategy in how they approach their customers both today and going forward.''
In interviews, officials at several of the top American banks that issue credit cards said they believed the worst of the troubled balances have worked their way through the system. Some said in filings this month that their delinquency rates for August were at their lowest levels this year and that they expected write-offs to decline, too.
''We see deleveraging of the consumer,'' said Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, adding that a frugal consumer, decreasing demand for credit and declining balances were also factors. ''As they work the balances down, they are not replenishing that with new debt,'' he added.
Bank of America's chief executive officer, Brian T. Moynihan, said in April that consumer loan balances were down $37 billion from a year earlier, with $34 billion of that reduction the result of charge-offs. But Mr. Moynihan said he expected future credit card losses to be lower.
Even private label cards, or those that can be used only at a single retailer, report an improvement. The largest issuer of such cards, General Electric, said delinquencies and charge-offs were lower in the second quarter of 2010 than in the previous quarter and year. ''U.S. consumers are by and large deleveraging,'' said Stephen White, a spokesman. ''They are buying less and electing to make purchases more often with debit cards.''
Economists agree that one of the consequences of deleveraging has been the shift to debit cards from credit cards, a migration that started before the recession but accelerated during it, said James Van Dyke, president of Javelin Strategy & Research.
David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, said the dollar amount of purchases put on debit cards is set to exceed those on credit cards sometime in 2014. That is partly because more cardholders will fall by the wayside as issuers raise prices for outstanding balances in response to the Card Act, he said.
''Between the recession-related psychology of not wanting to spend, out of fear of what the future might bring, you have the reality of people who simply don't have a credit card anymore.''

HEADLINE: Regulators Step In to Aid Credit Unions

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Nearly two years after Wall Street's giants were rescued by the federal government, regulators on Friday took over three financial institutions that provide the underpinning for hundreds of the nation's credit unions.
The three entities, known as wholesale credit unions and located in Connecticut, Illinois and Texas, were seized by regulators from the National Credit Union Administration, which supervises about 7,500 credit unions that provide basic banking services to millions of Americans. Most of those customers are linked to credit unions through their employers or through membership organizations.
Although an overwhelming majority of those credit unions are financially sound, some of the wholesale entities behind them have been hobbled by losses on subprime mortgage bonds and other complex investments. Of the 27 wholesale credit unions operating in the United States, five have been seized by regulators over the last 18 months. 
The agency announced a plan Friday to separate billions of dollars of the bad assets that have crippled those institutions and then repackage them for sale with a federal guarantee. It also established a set of regulations that will require wholesale credit unions to hold more capital and improve their risk management and governance practices.
It is the latest action by regulators to try to put the financial system on stronger footing, and comes as the nation's banks and thrifts have shown signs that they are gradually returning to health. Many of the biggest and most troubled institutions, like IndyMac and Washington Mutual, were resolved in the early days of the financial crisis.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures money deposited in commercial and savings banks, has shuttered more than 295 lenders over the last few years, including two on Friday. The pace of those interventions has been slowing.
The credit union rescue, however, presents a new twist. Credit unions have billed themselves as conservative safe havens that were insulated from risky business like subprime and commercial real estate lending. Now, two years into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, it seems that no area of the financial industry managed to escape the effects of the credit bubble.
Officials from the credit union regulator said they believed the steps taken on Friday should create stronger safeguards for the nation's credit unions and get the industry back on its feet.
''We feel the steps that we have taken have stabilized the system,'' said Debbie Matz, the agency's chairwoman. ''We are in the next stage: resolution and reform.''
Officials said they did not expect the rescue to cost taxpayers anything. Credit unions, however, will be liable for the cost, which Ms. Matz estimated to be as much as $9.2 billion. That could force many retail credit unions to pay higher insurance premiums to the National Credit Union Administration in the coming quarters, as the agency looks to replenish its deposit insurance fund.
Consumers, meanwhile, should not experience any service disruptions. Deposits are protected up to $250,000 per account.
The entities seized on Friday were Members United Corporate Federal Credit Union of Warrenville, Ill.; Southwest Corporate Federal Credit Union of Plano, Tex.; and Constitution Corporate Credit Union of Wallingford, Conn.
Last year, regulators closed two wholesale credit unions in Kansas and California and took control of their operations. Regulators will help repackage and sell off about $35 billion of troubled mortgage-related assets held by the five institutions.
Regulators had been grappling over how to deal with the troubled wholesale credit unions since the crisis unfolded two years ago, when the value of big portfolios of complex mortgage investments suddenly collapsed. Wholesale credit unions provide payment clearing and investment services to retail credit unions. They also give the retail credit unions a place to put their cash.
To stave off a run on the troubled wholesale credit unions, the National Credit Union Administration propped them up with an emergency guarantee on all their deposits. It also stepped up scrutiny of those institutions and began working with officials at the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies to develop a broader resolution plan.
As part of the effort, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, agreed to postpone the deadline for the credit union industry to cover the cost of the mortgage-related losses at the wholesale credit unions until June 2021. Previously, they had until 2016.

HEADLINE: Iran's President Expresses Hope for More Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Iran's president dismissed a fusillade of criticism on Friday over his inflammatory speech at the United Nations a day earlier, in which he asserted that most people believed the United States orchestrated the Sept. 11 attacks. 
But President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also offered a conciliatory gesture on his country's nuclear program, expressing hope that negotiations could resume as early as next month over a deal that would involve a swap of enriched uranium. The talks could restart a diplomatic process that collapsed last year and led to a fourth round of sanctions against Iran in June.
In his address on Thursday, which focused on what he portrayed as the collapse of the capitalist world order, Mr. Ahmadinejad cited conspiracy theories speculating that the United States had set up the Sept. 11 attacks to revive its economy and assert its influence over the Middle East. The comments prompted a walkout by the representatives of the United States and dozens of other nations and criticism from world leaders.
On Friday, President Obama called Mr. Ahmadinejad's comments ''hateful'' and ''offensive'' in an interview with the BBC's Persian-language news service, and the British deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said they were ''bizarre, offensive and attention-grabbing pronouncements'' aimed at deflecting the dialogue away from concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
''His remarks were intended to distract attention from Iran's obligations and to generate media headlines,'' Mr. Clegg said Friday in a speech to the General Assembly.
But Mr. Ahmadinejad seemed surprised by the response to his speech. ''Did I say anything wrong?'' he asked reporters at a Midtown Manhattan hotel. He argued that his comments would be unlikely to have any bearing on diplomatic efforts on Iran's nuclear program. ''What does this have to do with the nuclear issue? It has no connection to it.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad said that representatives from Iran and the group of nations pressing it over its nuclear ambitions would meet shortly to discuss a framework for future negotiations.
''We hope that by October they will be resumed,'' he said.
But senior American and Western officials said that despite Mr. Ahmadinejad's statements, they would wait to see what response Iran gave to negotiators. Attempts to contact the Iranians previously to set a specific date had been in vain, they said.
The talks have centered on an arrangement in which Iran would send much of its low-enriched uranium stockpiles abroad in exchange for specialized nuclear fuel that would be used in a medical research reactor in Tehran.

HEADLINE: Higher Prices Help KB Home Narrow Its Loss

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
KB Home posted a narrow quarterly loss on Friday as fewer write-downs and higher average selling prices helped increase revenue. But the company's backlog, which represents future housing revenue, declined, and net orders fell 39 percent as demand slowed after federal home buyer tax credits expired in April. KB Home said it lost $1.4 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, which compared with a loss of $66 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the third quarter of KB Home's fiscal year, rose 9 percent, to $501 million, the first year-over-year increase in almost four years. KB Home's chief executive, Jeffrey T. Mezger, said orders in June, traditionally one of the builder's best-selling months, fell by half versus, the same month last year. Orders gradually improved as the summer unfolded, but they remained well below prior-year levels. ''While we have seen improvement in our net orders over the past few months, sales remain soft and the weak economy continues to be a major impediment to any housing recovery,'' Mr. Mezger said. Stock in KB Home, which is based in Los Angeles, rose 40 cents, to $12.11 a share.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS BRIEFING FINANCE; Greece in a Deal for Investments From Qatar

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
Greece has signed a preliminary deal with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund that could clear the way for investments of up to $5 billion in the indebted European country, officials said Friday. 
A memorandum of understanding was signed in New York on Thursday by a Qatar Investment Authority executive, Ahmad Al-Sayyed, and Harris Pamboukis, Greece's state minister in charge of investment.
''The signing of the memorandum shows that Greece is attracting credible investors and it represents a new phase for the Greek economy,'' Mr Pamboukis said in a statement. ''Investments like these could help lay the foundations for future growth.''
The memorandum does not commit either side to specific projects, a Greek official, who was not permitted to speak publicly, said. But he said the planned investments would cover tourism, real estate, transport, infrastructure, finance and energy projects.
He said the two sides would soon set up a joint committee to identify possible investment projects.
There was no immediate comment from the Qatar Investment Authority; its offices in Doha were closed Friday.
Greece is in dire need of external funds. The government came close to defaulting on its debts this year, and in May European leaders and the International Monetary Fund agreed to a three-year, 110 billion euros, or $148 billion, bailout for Athens, which was tied to tough austerity measures.
The memorandum was signed in the presence of George Papandreou, the prime minister, and Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, the emir of Qatar. Mr. Papandreou has been promoting sales of state-owned real estate during a visit to the United States this week as a way of reducing Greece's large public debt.
Qatari investors in particular have been examining the possibility of developing the site of the former Athens international airport at Hellenikon, south of the capital, the Greek official said.
Greece and Qatar signed a similar memorandum in May covering exports of liquefied natural gas to Greece and construction of gas storage terminals at Greek ports.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Presses for Peace In Sudan's Likely Partition

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- After months of leaving Sudan policy on a back burner, President Obama put the weight of his administration and his own personal esteem in Africa on the line Friday, demanding that north and south Sudan ensure that their likely split into two nations early next year proceed peacefully.
At a high-level Sudan meeting on the sidelines of the United NationsGeneral Assembly, Mr. Obama said Washington would normalize relations should the Jan. 9 referendum for the independence of southern Sudan be carried off calmly and the Darfur conflict be settled. Failing in either would bring further isolation, he warned. 
If Khartoum fulfills its obligations in settling the conflicts, then the United States will support agricultural development, expand trade and investment, exchange ambassadors and eventually lift sanctions, Mr. Obama said.
''What happens in Sudan in the days ahead may decide whether a people who have endured too much war move forward towards peace or slip backwards into bloodshed,'' Mr. Obama said, establishing the warning tone taken by all speakers at the session.
With the southern Sudan independence vote a little more than 100 days away, preparations are greatly lagging. Voter registration that was to have been done by the end of August remains incomplete, and many technical issues are unsettled. Almost nothing has been done to prepare for a secondary referendum to decide the fate of Abyei, a contested area of important oil deposits.
The two sides are dragging their feet on details of the eventual divorce, given that the roughly 4.8 million eligible voters in the south, the only side voting, are likely to choose independence. With independence scheduled six months after the vote, major issues like citizenship, borders and the division of oil revenue have not been negotiated. At least 1.5 million southerners are believed to be living in Khartoum, the capital, and an unknown number of northerners in the south.
United Nations officials had intended the meeting to be a small gathering of foreign ministers to stress in the presence of senior representatives of both sides that the referendum not be delayed.
But it ballooned into something much larger after President Obama decided to attend. About 40 foreign leaders or senior officials signed up to speak. Ultimately the meeting became a highly visible means to serve notice that the onus is on the Sudanese to carry out the last, hardest stages of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement they signed in 2005.
All the governments participating, including major Security Council members like Russia and China, as well as major pan-African organizations, endorsed a final communique vowing that the referendum would be held on time and peace respected no matter what the outcome. It also stressed the need to support peacekeeping efforts in Darfur, the embattled western Sudanese region where violence flared anew in recent months.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement ended decades of war pitting the north, dominated by Arab Muslims, against the Christian and animist south. The civil war left two million people dead and millions more homeless.
Sudan borders on nine other African states, and many speakers worried aloud that any instability ''will not stop at its borders,'' said Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the leader of Qatar, which is trying to negotiate a peace among the Darfur militias.
The Sudanese had sought a closed meeting, but ultimately it was open, leaving Sudan's vice president, Ali Osman Taha, and Salva Kiir, the president of the south and a vice president in the north, to sketch their differences in diplomatic terms.
Mr. Taha assured the gathering that the referendum would be held on time, but he criticized the international community for supporting peace on one hand while continuing the ''demonization'' of the north on the other. The International Criminal Court's indictment of Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, on war crimes charges, economic sanctions, the lack of debt relief and Sudan's presence on the United States list of state sponsors of terrorism were all intended to weaken the country, he said.
Mr. Kiir said that the Jan. 9 referendum date was sacred and that any technical delays had to be overcome. ''Any delays risk the return to instability and violence,'' he said.
Numerous aid organizations, concerned that a lack of attention might encourage opponents of the referendum to delay it, hailed the meeting. But some were outraged that the final communique welcomed a commitment by Sudan to pursue war criminals, given that Mr. Bashir has mocked his own indictment.
The final communique could not really attack Mr. Bashir while encouraging him to respect the referendum deadline, said two senior officials involved with the negotiations, who said the reference to Sudan's commitment to pursue war criminals was to ensure that the issue of impunity would not be ignored.

HEADLINE: House Is Still Considering a Vote on Expiring Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Friday that Democrats in her chamber may still force a vote next week on the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, even though their counterparts in the Senate have decided not to bring the issue to the floor until after the November elections.
A decision to force such a vote could put a fiery finish on the brief fall Congressional session, and test the resolve of the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, who has said he would support a bill to extend only some of the tax cuts if Democrats gave him no other choice. 
President Obama and Democratic leaders would like to make the lower Bush-era tax rates permanent for couples earning up to $250,000 a year and individuals earning up to $200,000, but allow the tax breaks to expire on income above those amounts for wealthier Americans. Republicans, including Mr. Boehner, and also some Democrats, have said that the lower rates should be extended for everyone, at least temporarily.
Some Democrats expressed surprise that Ms. Pelosi was still contemplating a vote after the Senate decided on Thursday to postpone action.
But Democrats who are lobbying for a vote say it could draw a stark contrast between the two parties by highlighting the potential willingness of Republicans to block tax relief for most Americans while insisting tax breaks for the rich.
''We will retain the right to proceed as we choose and would take it one day at a time,'' Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference at the Capitol. ''But let me be very clear, as we have all been clear in the House Democratic leadership. America's middle class will have a tax cut. It will be done in this Congress. There is no question about that.''
But a number of Democrats, including some in tough re-election campaigns, would prefer to avoid a vote that could be used by opponents to portray them as allowing taxes to rise during a weak economy, and would rather wait to deal with the tax cut issue until a lame-duck session. Republicans say the higher tax rates would hurt some small-business owners, who report their profits as personal income.
A spokesman for Mr. Boehner said his position, favoring a continuation of all of the lower tax rates, had not changed. The spokesman, Michael Steel, would not comment on how Mr. Boehner might vote but said he ''has always believed that we need to stop all of the tax hikes on American families and small businesses scheduled for Jan. 1.''
A decision on the tax cut issue is likely to be made quickly. House Democratic leaders tentatively plan to adjourn by Thursday, allowing lawmakers to return home and focus on their re-election campaigns. But they must first adopt a temporary spending resolution to finance the federal government until after the elections.
The House also plans to vote on a bill that would provide money to treat health conditions related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and compensation for people injured in the attacks or for emergency and other workers who responded to the World Trade Center site. A vote is also planned on a bill that would give the Obama administration greater leverage to use trade rules to pressure China on its currency policy.
Ms. Pelosi said she also still hoped to take up other issues, including a child nutrition bill.
The only obligatory vote, however, is on the spending measure to keep the government running after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.
''We can't go home until we have a continuing resolution, and that's what we are putting together now,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''And when we have that, we can make a decision as to when we go home.''
The reticence of some politically vulnerable Democrats to vote on the tax cut issue before the elections was a factor in the decision by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, to delay the floor debate.
The Senate's plan means no law could win final approval until a lame-duck session, potentially pushing the highly contentious issue down to the wire. If Congress does not act, all of the tax rates will expire on Dec. 31.
If House Democrats do bring the tax-cut issue to the floor, aides said the vote could be set up strategically to require a two-thirds majority for passage. That would mean Democrats could not succeed in winning an extension of the tax cuts at the lower income levels without substantial Republican support.
There are currently 255 Democrats and 178 Republicans in the House, with two vacancies, meaning 289 votes would be needed to pass the bill if everyone was present and voting.
Maintaining the tax breaks at the higher income levels would add approximately $700 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years -- a price tag that Mr. Obama and his economic advisers say the country cannot afford at a time of rising deficits.
For Republicans, the weak economy makes it easier to push for extending the lower rates. Most Republicans have long advocated making the tax cuts permanent, under any economic circumstances. And extending the cuts was one of the top priorities included in new legislative blueprint introduced earlier this week by House Republicans.
Senate Democrats have scheduled a procedural vote next week on a bill intended to end tax loopholes that the bill's sponsors say encourage companies to outsource jobs overseas, and would also provide an incentive for businesses to bring jobs back to the United States.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, criticized the proposed bill on Friday, saying, ''The majority has wasted months in this chamber trying to tell the private sector what to do instead of providing certainty to help them make investment decisions.''
With election-season politics leaving little room for compromise on policy issues, the Senate, too, could adjourn by the end of next week.

HEADLINE: Equestrian World's Royal Challenge

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
BAYAMON, P.R. -- As a daughter of King Hussein and the wife of the ruler of Dubai, Princess Haya bint al-Hussein of Jordan has the pedigree that is practically a prerequisite for presiding over the International Equestrian Federation, which governs the sport. Members of noble or royal families have led the organization, with few exceptions, since its founding in 1921.
But in her four years as president, Princess Haya has defied prim royal stereotypes by shaking things up. She dissolved the committee that oversees the discipline of dressage, calling its members ''uncooperative and self-serving.'' She pushed through a measure that would have allowed the use of several controversial drugs for horses. And she has cracked down on cheating in the sport even as she recused herself from an inquiry in 2009 involving horses, belonging to her husband and one of his sons, that had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. 
Princess Haya's tenure has been so contentious that two men are opposing her in an election scheduled for November, the first time an incumbent federation president has been challenged. The vote is likely to be a juicy topic of conversation at the World Equestrian Games, which open Saturday in Lexington, Ky. The two-week event, being held outside Europe for the first time in its 20-year history, is on a par with the Olympics in prestige, and it will draw horse enthusiasts from around the world.
While not exactly rejecting her royal identity, Princess Haya has long challenged what it means to be a princess. In Jordan, she is the only woman licensed to drive heavy trucks. In her 20s, she pursued a full-time career as an equestrian athlete, competing in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and driving her horses across Europe in a custom tractor-trailer.
Now 36, she is the worldly junior wife of Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, 61, making appearances in jeans, her long hair flowing, even as his senior wife leads a more private life.
Those who support her say Princess Haya has taken on some of the federation's thorniest issues. Her royal predecessors include Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and the Infanta Dona Pilar de Borbon, the sister of King Juan Carlos of Spain.
''I really was surprised to see that a princess could be so down to reality and work so much, with her own hands,'' said Diana M. Ramos, a dressage rider from the Dominican Republic who served until recently on a federation governing committee. Although her country's federation voted against Princess Haya in 2006, Ramos said she had since won them over. ''She's really a woman of this time.''
But to her critics, Princess Haya is an autocrat who makes rash decisions. One rival is the first vice president, Sven Holmberg of Sweden, who promises a restructuring of the federation to incorporate more grass-roots views.
''It's been too much a top-down design rather than the other way around,'' Holmberg said in a telephone interview.
Princess Haya acknowledged that her style had turned off some people. ''I could have done things differently,'' she said, ''but the results would have been the same.''
There is nothing genteel about this election, in which the winner needs a two-thirds majority from the roughly 130 national federations casting votes at the General Assembly in Taiwan. Princess Haya's challengers, Holmberg and Henk Rottinghuis of the Netherlands, each have a Web site. And this summer Princess Haya made a swing through the Western Hemisphere, including a stop in Puerto Rico in July to attend the Latin American and Caribbean Games.
During the equestrian competition in Puerto Rico, Princess Haya looked crisp in a blue oxford shirt and black jeans despite the 90-degree heat. She mingled with the sport's local leaders as reporters documented her every move. Inside the stables, she waved off the photographers, citing concern for the horses. ''This is their bedroom,'' she said as she walked along the stalls, tickling horses' muzzles and feeding them carrots.
Her mother, Queen Alia, was killed in a helicopter crash when she was 2. Shortly after the crash, she received from her father a foal, Bint al-Reeh, or Daughter of the Wind, whose mother had also died.
Caring for another living being is ''often the easiest way to get over your own pain,'' she said. At 13, she competed in her first international event and joined the show-jumping circuit full time upon earning a degree from Oxford in politics, philosophy and economics.
Princess Haya was not a standout rider, finishing 70th at the Sydney Games, but she identified with being an athlete. ''I was able to interact with levels of society in Jordan that I would have never probably seen in the palace,'' she said.
Even as she has stayed within certain conventions, she has challenged others. Princess Haya speaks with passion about her trucking license, which she earned at age 19.
''I used to watch these American movies with people driving lorries, big artics,'' she said, describing articulated trucks, ''and talking on the radio to each other. And I just thought it was what I wanted to do.''
Her father, who died in 1999, used to delight at hearing about the trucker cafes she frequented on the road. ''I used to come back home and tell him all these stories and all the latest jokes about the family.''
She is not above playing practical jokes either. Princess Haya recalled the time a few years ago when Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London Organizing Committee for the Olympics, showed her around Greenwich Park, where the equestrian stadium will be for the 2012 Games. When the need for additional seating came up, Princess Haya pointed toward the Queen's House, a London treasure.
''Can't we just knock it down?'' she recalled telling Coe.
''You could see him thinking: 'Arab princess. Is she serious? Are we going to have a problem?' '' She gave a sly smile, saying, ''Very funny.''
Since marrying in 2004, Princess Haya has appeared with her husband at public events in Dubai. His senior wife, Sheika Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma al-Maktoum, is rarely seen. She was married in 1979 and is mother to the 27-year-old crown prince. Princess Haya and the sheik have one child, Sheika al-Jalila, 2.
When asked whether they had discussed her role before their marriage, Princess Haya laughed and said: ''There was no discussion. It was the fact that I loved him and how I would move my stuff from home to Dubai. Practical things.''
She added, ''I see my role as Sheik Mohammed's wife.'' Princess Haya is also active in humanitarian work. ''She doesn't do it with bravado or lots of publicity,'' said Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general. He said he was impressed when, on a trip to Kenya, she visited victims of ethnic violence before meeting with the president.
Sorting out these disparate roles -- she uses a BlackBerry for equestrian business and an iPhone for everything else -- can be difficult. Once, after a long discussion with a world hunger expert, she took a call to discuss whether men and women in the discipline of vaulting should wear the same type of unitard. ''I didn't know what the word was until about halfway through the conversation,'' she said. ''It was very bizarre.''
Princess Haya said she was actually more methodical than spontaneous. ''Sometimes to the outside world, I can move quite fast, but it's because I spent so much time thinking about it,'' she said.
Of her tenure, she said she was proud of bringing in more qualified staff members, developing a sponsorship plan and helping to put in place an integrity unit to crack down on doping and cheating. She has also contributed in ways few can match, donating about $32 million toward the purchase and renovation of federation headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Some of her other moves have not been as politic. Last November she was criticized for introducing a list permitting use of anti-inflammatory drugs for horses. Eventually, Princess Haya was forced to withdraw the proposal for the drugs, which can mask serious injuries before competition.
Complicating the issue is that in 2009 Princess Haya's husband was barred from competition for 6 months and the crown prince 10 months for drug violations. She has said that the sheik's workers discovered the use of illegal substances and reported them to the federation at his request.
Holmberg acknowledged that he is running because he strongly opposed her position on anti-inflammatory drugs. And Rottinghuis, a former Dutch equestrian official who ran an international trading company, said European equestrian officials asked him to run against her. He has said that the federation's image has suffered recently and that the sport is not globalizing quickly enough.
''I think someone with my profile could help the F.E.I. in the next four years,'' he said.
Like a skilled politician, Princess Haya was upbeat about being the first incumbent to face a contested election, calling it progress. Once, she said, members of royalty assumed the presidency with little opposition.
''When I started, it was a federation that couldn't look to the future.'' Now, she added, ''I'd like to think that this is a federation that anybody can lead.''

HEADLINE: Magazine's Obama Critique Spurs Fact Checking and Media Soul Searching

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
When Forbes published a cover story this month by Dinesh D'Souza, the conservative author, asserting that President Obama is opposed to free markets and traditional American values because he inherited his father's anticolonial beliefs, all the media tripwires were set off: enthusiastic support by conservative commentators like Glenn Beck, Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh, and an uproar among liberal bloggers and columnists.
But after a meeting last week with the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the magazine, which initially defended the article, agreed to a post-publication fact-checking process to see if an apology or a correction was warranted, according to Bill Burton, a White House spokesman. 
Monie Begley, a spokeswoman for Forbes, said that the magazine's Washington bureau chief, who was not involved in the article, had met with Mr. Gibbs but that the decision to check the article was made not in response to the White House but to the general clamor in the news media.
In one sense, the episode was a cautionary tale for the new media age, which finds traditional media outlets like Forbes responding both to the economic imperatives of the digital age by cutting staff and to the editorial imperatives by bringing in more outside voices -- Mr. D'Souza is not a staff writer -- and sometimes elevating opinion above rigorous reporting.
Those efforts are amplified by the country's coarse political discourse, where everyone has a soapbox to advance theories -- buttressed by the truth, or not, in the case of the so-called birther movement, which argues that President Obama is not a United States-born citizen -- and facts are fought over as much as ideas.
On Thursday, the magazine issued a minor correction on its Web site, saying that Mr. D'Souza had ''slightly misquoted'' Mr. Obama from a speech he gave about the BP oil spill. Mr. D'Souza also said that Mr. Obama did not focus in the speech on ''cleanup strategies.'' Forbes' correction stated, ''Obama's speech did discuss concrete measures to investigate the oil spill and bring it under control.'' The Forbes spokeswoman said that the correction put an end to the magazine's review of the matter.
The controversy coincides with a redesign of Forbes under its new editorial overseer, Lewis D'Vorkin. Forbes recently purchased Mr. D'Vorkin's freelance journalism Web site, and in some respects Mr. D'Vorkin is trying to replicate that model at Forbes.
His title is chief product officer -- he oversees the editorial content of both the Web site and the magazine -- but he is not the editor in chief. That role falls to Steve Forbes. As for the decision to run Mr. D'Souza's piece, Ms. Begley said, ''It's an internal process and Steve Forbes is editor in chief.''
The essay in Forbes was adapted from Mr. D'Souza's book ''The Roots of Obama's Rage,'' which is being published by Regnery Publishing and will be released on Oct. 4. Kathleen Sweetapple, a publicist for Regnery, e-mailed a statement on behalf of Mr. D'Souza, who wrote, ''there are a couple of minor errors that are completely inconsequential; what the critics are fuming about are not factual errors but disagreements of interpretation.''
In discrediting Mr. Obama's American-ness, the essay by Mr. D'Souza, a former policy adviser in the Reagan White House and best-selling author, seemingly stitched some intellectual heft to what has long been a fringe idea of the far right -- that Mr. Obama's Kenyan roots and Hawaiian boyhood make him a lesser American.
Mr. D'Souza offered as evidence Mr. Obama's support for the Islamic center and mosque project near ground zero, even though the president has gone only so far as to say the developers have a constitutional right to build a mosque.
Mr. D'Souza also questioned recent comments by the head of NASA that the president wanted the agency to reach out to the Muslim world to acknowledge Muslims' ''historic contribution to science and math and engineering.'' Mr. D'Souza described it as a ''curious mandate to convert a space agency into a Muslim and international outreach.''
Mr. Gingrich described Mr. D'Souza's theory as ''stunningly insightful,'' while an editor at The Columbia Journalism Review called it, ''the worst kind of smear journalism.''
One of the most contentious points in Mr. D'Souza's article was his citation of a transaction by the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance offshore drilling in Brazil, a deal Mr. D'Souza believes indicates Mr. Obama is more concerned with helping countries that formerly were the domains of colonial powers, rather than Americans.
A Forbes fact checker recently contacted the bank to check on the assertion that Mr. Obama supported the 2009 transaction with Petrobras, Brazil's state-owned oil company. Mr. D'Souza asserted that Mr. Obama supported the deal, ''not so oil ends up in the U.S. He is funding Brazilian exploration so that the oil can stay in Brazil.''
A note written by Kevin Varney, the senior vice president and chief of staff of the bank, and posted in the comments section of Mr. D'Souza's blog -- and verified by a spokesman for the bank -- criticized Mr. D'Souza for not contacting the bank before publication.
''I received a call yesterday from Nathan Verdi, a fact checker at Forbes, who was calling to fact check your article after it was published. (Is this how journalism works now?)''
In an interview, Mr. Varney explained that the transaction ''was begun in 2008 with career staffers and approved in 2009 by five Bush-appointed board members.'' Furthermore, he said a transaction like the Brazilian one -- which provided loan guarantees for Petrobras to purchase drilling and safety equipment from United States manufacturers -- did not even rise to the level of presidential awareness.
Mr. Varney said that to cite the deal as evidence of ''an anticolonial, Kenyan ideology'' on the part of Mr. Obama is ''preposterous, it's false and it's wrong.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Durable Goods Orders Fall; Business Spending Rises

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New orders for long-lasting American manufactured goods fell more than expected in August to post their largest decline in a year as bookings for aircraft and motor vehicles tumbled, but business spending rebounded strongly, a government report showed on Friday. 
The Commerce Department said durable goods orders dropped 1.3 percent after a revised 0.7 percent increase in July. Markets had expected orders to fall 1.0 percent from a previously reported 0.4 percent gain. The decline last month reflected a 40.2 percent plunge in nonmilitary aircraft orders after a 69.1 percent surge in July.
The Boeing Company received only 10 orders for civilian aircraft in August, a sharp slowdown from 130 bookings in July, according to information posted on the plane maker's Web site. Orders were also weighed down by bookings for military aircraft, which fell 2.7 percent, and a 4.4 percent drop in motor vehicle orders.
Excluding transportation, orders rose by a more-than-expected 2 percent after falling by a revised 2.8 percent in July, previously reported as a 3.7 percent fall. It was the largest rise since March.
Markets had expected a 1.0-percent rise in orders excluding transportation.
Durable goods orders are a leading indicator of manufacturing, a sector leading the economy's recovery from the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression as businesses replenish inventories.
But manufacturing is slowing as domestic demand remains tepid, with households grappling with unemployment and falling wealth.
Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, rebounded 4.1 percent in August after a 5.3 percent drop in July. Markets had expected a 2.0 percent rise.
Durable goods inventories rose 0.4 percent after increasing 0.6 percent in July. Shipments, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, declined 1.5 percent last month, while unfilled orders dropped for a second straight month.
In a second report, sales of new homes in the United States were flat in August, but the supply of houses on the market tumbled to the lowest level in 42 years.
The Commerce Department reported August sales at a 288,000 unit annual rate, unchanged from July's rate, which was revised up from a previously reported 276,000 unit pace. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales rising to a 290,000 unit pace in August.
The housing market is starting to stabilize after a downward spiral after the end of a home-buyer tax credit in April. Data this week showed home construction rose last month and sales of previously owned homes crawled off 13-year lows.
But activity in the sector, which contributed to the worst recession since the Great Depression, remains subdued amid a 9.6 percent unemployment rate.
The number of new homes available for sale fell 1.4 percent to 206,000 units, the lowest since August 1968. Despite August's unchanged sales pace, the supply of new homes on the market dipped to 8.6 months' worth from 8.7 months' worth in July.
The median sale price for a new home fell 0.6 percent last month from July to $204,700, the lowest since December 2003. Compared with August last year, the median price fell 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Avoid Legal Pitfalls When Buying Art

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Even in a sluggish economy, art auctions can be frothy places. But as the fall auction season kicks into high gear, the same emotion that gets buyers to bid up works of art may well lead to a different variation of buyer's remorse.
The problem is in buying art that has unseen strings attached. The cases associated with Nazi-era art looting are well known. But claims associated with outright theft count for only a quarter of the lawsuits brought against owners of art, according to Judith Pearson, president of Aris, a title insurer specializing in art. The bulk of the claims come from more traditional liens and encumbrances. 
''There are all kinds of examples -- someone didn't have the authority to sell the art, the I.R.S. has a lien on all assets for not paying taxes, the art was used as collateral for a loan and the loan wasn't paid off,'' she said.
This weekend's auction of the Neuberger Berman and Lehman Brothers corporate art collections has several art advisers talking. While no one has suggested any impropriety in the sale, which was approved by a bankruptcy court judge, several advisers discussed other auctions that involved claims against the art. A spokeswoman for Sotheby's, which is handling the Lehman auction, did not return repeated calls.
Joel Lever, a partner at the law firm Kurzman Eisenberg Corbin & Lever, said a client who had bought art from a bankruptcy auction in Japan ended up being challenged by the firm's corporate creditors. Another client bought a work of art from a respected Zurich dealer only to learn, when he sought to sell it at auction in the United States, that the piece was a forgery.
''It's important to generally talk about protecting what a buyer should do,'' Mr. Lever said. ''There is an arrogance of the buyer, often my client, and the seller, a well-known auction house, that exposes them to risks that they would not take with any other asset class.''
Stories of frauds appeal to our romantic imagination, and the authenticity of any work should be verified. But buyers should concern themselves this auction season with three other things first: value, liens and legal protection.
After the last auctions in the spring, the Mei Moses Fine Art Index showed prices for Impressionist, old master and postwar art had rebounded significantly from lows in 2009. The biggest gains were in postwar art, which increased some 30 percent, according to the index.
That would seem to be good news, but several advisers pointed out that buyers can get caught up in the euphoria in a market heading up. ''The minute you buy something, you need to know what your exit strategy is,'' said Peter May, an independent wealth consultant in Philadelphia.
Mr. May specializes in advising clients on buying art, and he said all buyers expect their art to increase in value. But that is not always the case. Worse, many buyers do not think about how they may eventually sell the art or handle its transfer to their heirs.
Advisers' more immediate concern, though, is the client who gets caught up in the moment. Auction catalogs are produced months in advance of the actual sale, which should give buyers plenty of time to assess how much they are willing to pay for a piece of art. Yet buyers too often start bidding and end up paying more than they expected to.
''I have many clients who lose all discipline, like they were at the craps table,'' Mr. Lever said.
Regardless of how you buy the piece of art or how much you pay, these advisers agreed that it is important to make sure the piece has no liens against it. ''Most people think of fraudulent transactions,'' Mr. May said. ''But you also have normal business issues, or it's personal property of your balance sheet and you're about to be sued.''
This is where Ms. Pearson's company comes in. After searching liens and claims against the piece of art as well as researching its provenance, the company makes a risk assessment and decides on a one-time premium for the piece.
These rates range from 1 to 5 percent of the value, with the higher premiums going to World War II-era art that could be linked to the Nazi looting. ''Just because you paid for a painting, it doesn't mean you own it,'' Ms. Pearson said.
The reality, though, is that title insurance is still not broadly accepted. ''It hasn't been purchased on a widespread basis,'' said Paul Funk, executive managing director at Frank Crystal & Company, an insurance brokerage. ''We're dealing with very high net worth clients and we're not hearing from them that this is coverage they want to buy. We've heard it come up more with hedge funds buying art and they have investors behind them.''
Mr. Funk said major carriers do not offer endorsements that protect collectors from buying a piece of art that was fraudulently sold to them.
That is why, the advisers said, you should take your time in negotiating sale contracts and doing due diligence ahead of an auction.
''It behooves you to get a third party to inspect and value the authenticity of the art,'' Mr. Lever said. ''It's expensive and difficult to do but you should be doing that if you want to protect your claim.''
The advisers also recommended having a contract in place that says what reparations will be paid if the work is found out to be a forgery or to have been fraudulently conveyed. This is what Mr. Lever did on behalf of the client whose art turned out to be a forgery. Because the dealer, widely respected in the Zurich art world, did not want his reputation besmirched, he agreed to settle the claim out of court.
''We ended up settling, and rather quickly,'' he said. If he had let his client rush into the transaction, he said, the result might have been quite different.

HEADLINE: Fair and Equal Paychecks for Women

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Fair Pay Isn't Always Equal Pay'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 22):
Christina Hoff Sommers's ominous warnings of ''multimillion-dollar lawsuits'' should the Paycheck Fairness Act pass smell of fear-mongering hyperbole. We've heard it before, when critics warned that lawsuits would flood our courts after the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It hasn't happened.
The wage gap is real. Our 2007 report, ''Behind the Pay Gap,'' which controlled for factors flagged by Ms. Sommers, like education and experience, found that college-educated women earn less than men with comparable backgrounds. Even the Bush administration acknowledged the existence of the wage gap. 
The latest analysis Ms. Sommers cites, which shows young women outearning young men, needs to be viewed with a skeptical eye. The average American woman still earns 23 percent less than her male counterpart earns, a gap that is widest among older women and smallest among younger women.
With two-income families the norm, and with women increasingly assuming the role of primary breadwinner, Ms. Sommers's criticism of the Paycheck Fairness Act reminds us of Chicken Little crying about the falling sky. Widely seen as an excellent tool to help close the gender wage gap, the Paycheck Fairness Act isn't about lawsuits. It's about American families. And it's time we put them first.
Linda D. Hallman Executive Director American Association of University Women Washington, Sept. 22, 2010
To the Editor:
Christina Hoff Sommers contends that the Paycheck Fairness Act, which passed the House and which the Senate may soon vote on, ''isn't as commonsensical as it might seem.''
The Paycheck Fairness Act will ensure that legislation already on the books -- the Equal Pay Act of 1963 -- is adequately enforced. It will give women the right to know what their male colleagues earn without fear of retaliation by their employer.
Women are regularly fired or disciplined for asking how much their male peers earn for doing the same work. If I don't know how much the man sitting in the cubicle next to me earns, how can I know whether I'm earning a fair day's pay? Giving women the right to ask questions about pay pretty much defines common sense.
Heather Boushey Senior Economist Center for American Progress Washington, Sept. 22, 2010
To the Editor:
Christina Hoff Sommers is absolutely right about one thing: the Paycheck Fairness Act on its own is unlikely to close the gender wage gap. It does not address the fact that child care workers -- almost all female -- rank among the 10 lowest paid occupations, even though almost half of child care workers hold some college qualifications.
Nor that jobs done by women typically require higher levels of qualifications than jobs done by men, yet on average pay less. Addressing those aspects of inequality requires broader policy changes and work-family supports.
But the Paycheck Fairness Act addresses at least one barrier faced by working women: outright pay discrimination. More than 40 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed, employers can (and do) still get away with paying a woman less than a man for the same work, because the mere act of discussing her pay with her colleagues may get her fired. That needs to change.
Ariane Hegewisch Study Director, Institute for Women's Policy Research Washington, Sept. 22, 2010

HEADLINE: Hostility Toward the Roma in Europe

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Roma, on Move, Test Europe's 'Open Borders' '' (front page, Sept. 17): 
As a result of my work and travels in Central and Eastern Europe as a klezmer musician, I have become acutely aware of not only the cultural significance of the Roma, but also their historical and present-day persecution. President Nicolas Sarkozy's attempt to expel the Roma from France has its silver lining -- a front-page article in The Times on the plight of European Roma.
The Roma have not integrated into their host countries' general population after centuries of exclusion. If they are unable to attend school, they are criticized for being uneducated; if they are unable to get work, they are criticized for being unemployed; and if they are unable to get proper housing, they are criticized for their ''camps.'' In American terms, their lives are similar to those of African-Americans in Mississippi before the civil rights movement.
The Roma have been in Europe for more than a thousand years, and during this period they have been kept in abject poverty and treated like third-class citizens. The Roma were the only ethnic group besides Jews to be targeted for extermination by the Nazis.
This systematic and government-sponsored discrimination has been tolerated and perpetuated on the entire continent. Perhaps we owe President Sarkozy an irony-laden ''merci'' for doing something so nakedly repulsive that these practices can no longer be ignored?

AFTERSHOCK
The Next Economy and America's Future
By Robert B. Reich
174 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25
Way way back, which means before the financial sector imploded, it wasn't Wall Street bonuses and vampire squids that excited the most fury. People agonized, instead, about the stagnation of middle-class incomes and exploding inequality. In ''Aftershock'' -- impressively, his 12th book -- Robert B. Reich steers our attention back to those earlier worries, which have arguably become more urgent in the wake of the financial crisis. But right on the first page, he comes close to blowing it.
Reich opens his book by quoting Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. ''For too long,'' Geithner says, referring to the period leading up to the financial bust, ''Americans were buying too much and saving too little.'' This assertion is so sleep-inducingly true that one wonders why Reich bothers to invoke it. But then, astonishingly, the author's purpose becomes clear. He actually doesn't agree with it. 
Reich insists instead that American consumers, and particularly the middle class, have been buying too little. For years, the United States has consumed more than it has produced; the excess demand has sucked in products from abroad, which is why the nation has run a trade deficit. The idea that the economy has suffered from a lack of demand is, shall we say, eccentric. But Reich declares repeatedly that the stagnation of middle-class buying power has been a drag on growth. ''If earnings are inadequate,'' he asserts, ''an economy produces more goods and services than its people are capable of purchasing.'' If that sentence described the American condition in the 1990s and the period leading up to the crash, Reich's predicted excess output would have gone abroad and the United States would have run a trade surplus.
Reich is trying to fortify the standard case for redistribution. As he acknowledges, he could have grounded his argument in morality: it is simply unfair that the richest 1 percent of Americans capture almost a quarter of the total income in the economy. Alternatively, Reich could have invoked American values: a grotesquely skewed inequality of outcomes is bound to tip the playing field for the next generation of Americans, mocking the nation's commitment to equality of opportunity. But instead Reich reaches for an economic claim -- that redistribution is a prerequisite for growth. He fumbles it.
This is a pity, since much of Reich's book is important and well executed. A Berkeley professor, public radio commentator and Clinton-era labor secretary, he is fluent, fearless, even amusing. He cheerfully denounces members of his own party: Senator Chris Dodd for his cozy links to the financial industry, Tom Daschle for monetizing his connections after leaving the Senate and failing to pay taxes, Dick Gephardt for denouncing lobbyists and then becoming one. Recalling the 1950s, when white male workers had it good, Reich wryly acknowledges that others fared less well. In 1957, United Airlines advertised its ''executive'' service between New York and Chicago, promising comfortable slippers, a steak dinner and ''no women on board except for two stewardesses.''
Setting aside his confused stance on middle-class demand, Reich makes several cogent arguments. Drawing on well-known findings from psychology and economics, he notes that people find it hard not to increase consumption when others around them are spending lavishly. In a poor country, a man proves that he loves his wife by presenting her with a rose; in a country where the rich splash money on extravagant bouquets, even ordinary husbands feel obliged to buy six roses. Thanks at least partly to the example set by millionaire nuptials, the cost of the typical American wedding rose to about $28,000 from $11,000 between 1980 and 2007 after adjusting for inflation.
Caught between rising aspirations and stagnant wages, Reich says, middle-class Americans have gone through a series of coping mechanisms. First, women joined the workforce, giving families a second income. Then husbands and wives put in longer shifts, creating a species of family called DINS -- ''double income, no sex.'' Finally, families went into debt. In this sense, inequality helped to stoke the credit bubble.
Now that the bubble has burst, these coping mechanisms are exhausted. Americans are not going to push their working hours up even more. Already, according to some estimates, they sleep an average of one or two fewer hours per night than did their parents in the 1960s; in 2007 they spent a whopping $23.9 billion on sleep aids, from white-noise machines to medications. Nor are Americans going to incur more debts; to the contrary, the credit bust has forced them to pay down their balances. And so, as Reich puts it, Americans will ''face a necessity they have managed to avoid for decades: They have to make do with less.''
The belt-tightening is not likely to be popular, and Reich goes so far as to suggest that it could trigger a political convulsion. People are very likely to resent material losses bitterly if these are not broadly and fairly shared. And in the wake of the financial crisis, fairness has gone by the wayside: millions of Americans have lost jobs, but the financial sector has bounced back; eye-popping bonuses have returned; and last year the top 25 earners at hedge funds bagged a combined $25 billion. At some point in the not-too-distant future, Reich warns, C.E.O.'s may find that limousines are being purposely scratched and mobs are picketing their offices.
Reich concludes with a wish list of reforms that might head off such a confrontation. He wants a more progressive income tax, including negative taxes for anyone earning below $50,000. He wants a top income-tax rate of 55 percent, with the kicker that income from capital gains, now taxed at 15 percent, would face the same rate as income from salaries. He wants wage insurance -- temporary compensation for workers who take big pay cuts when they shift jobs -- as well as investments that make public transportation and Medicare more available. These proposals are generally reasonable -- the top marginal tax rate was 70 percent or more between 1936 and 1980, a period of generally strong growth, and Medicare is more cost-effective than private insurance. But Reich also throws a few curveballs, and fails to discuss the gains in social fairness and economic growth that could be secured by limiting mortgage-interest deductions and other loopholes in the tax code.
But the really interesting question is whether Reich is right about the politics -- whether the new Gilded Age will conjure up a new William Jennings Bryan, and whether such a candidate could be elected. Even in the harshest periods of American history, after all, economic resentments have been surprisingly muted and rabble-rousing populists have failed to win power. Toward the end of the Depression, in the late 1930s, a sociologist named Alfred Winslow Jones conducted field research around the violently strike-prone factories of Akron, Ohio, expecting that bitter industrial conflict might have created equally bitter class divisions. To his surprise, he found little evidence of such polarization.
Thus reassured, Jones migrated from sociology to journalism to finance. Ultimately, in a twist that Reich might grimly appreciate, he invented a fantastically profitable investment vehicle. He called it a ''hedged fund.''

HEADLINE: From the Bargain Bin To the Battle Lines

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
MOST versions of the 2011 Volkswagen Jetta are capable of inducing a sort of reverse sticker shock, since they now cost some $1,700 to $2,300 less than the cars they replaced. No one is going to organize a protest against lower prices, but it is unclear how consumers will react to how Volkswagen achieved the savings.
In one change, the basic S version gets a smaller engine with 55 less horsepower than last year.
In another, rear disc brakes, once standard on all Jettas, have been replaced by cheaper drum brakes on some versions. 
The independent rear suspension is gone, replaced on all but one model by a less expensive torsion-beam design.
The styling is decidedly conservative, and the interior lacks the high-rent look of past Jettas.
On the other hand, even that S base model has electronic stability control, a life-saving feature. Base versions of the Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra do not, although the Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Cruze do.
Even the lowly S offers an unmatched package of standard features, including air-conditioning, heated mirrors, power locks, power windows, keyless locking and free routine maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles.
And a week spent in an up-level SEL showed that the Jetta's handling still shines, even if some of the other attributes have lost their glitter.
Volkswagen lowered prices because the Jetta was getting clobbered by competitors in the sales charts, and it is an incredibly important model for the company -- accounting last year for slightly more than half of the 213,000 VWs sold in the United States. Those 108,000 Jetta sales compared with 266,000 Corollas and almost 260,000 Civics, according to J. D. Power & Associates.
When the new Jetta goes on sale in October, the S will start at $15,995, or $1,740 less than last year. The SE is $18,195 or $2,355 less. At $21,395 (including a navigation system), the SEL is $2,060 less. But the TDI, with a diesel engine, is up $165, to $22,995. (Prices do not include a $770 shipping charge.) A 6-speed automatic transmission costs $1,100 more.
My test car was an SEL with the automatic and a sunroof. It was $24,165, including shipping.
While prices have shrunk, the overall length has grown about three inches, making the Jetta some five inches longer than the Civic. Rear legroom has increased 2.7 inches, giving it more than the Civic, Corolla, Cruze or Elantra.
I found the driver's seat on the test car comfortable enough for a four-hour stint, and the controls, including the navigation system, were easy to use. But gone is the classy interior that once set the compact-car standard and was the envy of competitors.
The switches in the 2011 Jetta felt flimsy; part of an air-conditioning vent fell off. The push-button starter on the console had a cheap aftermarket look. While I found the interior more disappointing than offensive, a colleague described it as ''cheesy,'' which I suspect is seen as praise only within the dairy industry.
Volkswagen has also changed the way the angle of the front seats is adjusted. Previously, one had to reach back in an awkward chicken-wing maneuver to turn a knob. While not easy to use, the mechanism allowed precise adjustment. VW still requires the odd reach, but now you use a cheap-feeling lever that is less precise.
The trunk, measuring 15.5 cubic feet, is quite large.
What VW did not cut is the Jetta's core value: how entertaining it can be to drive. On 60 miles of two-lanes through the White Mountains of New Hampshire, it eagerly handled challenges like a tight turn in one direction immediately followed by a wicked, increasingly sharp turn the other way. And while it no longer has an independent rear suspension, it wasn't upset by rumpled surfaces in the middle of a fast turn. Also, the ride quality, while not exactly plush, was impressive for a sedan with serious sporting ability. The suspension softened most of the impact of even large potholes or badly broken pavement.
My only complaint was that the steering -- while predictable and relatively quick -- could use more weight.
The brake pedal had a firm and progressive feel. All SELs, like my test car, have discs brakes at the rear, as does the TDI; other trim versions have rear drums. Volkswagen says its testing indicates that the Jetta stops just as well with the cheaper drum brakes as with rear discs.
Why, then, does VW include discs on the SEL and TDI? Kerry Christopher, a company spokesman, said, ''We still offer disc brakes on certain models because many consumers associate disc brakes with improved performance and appearance.''
Although there is an optional, firmer sport suspension, the standard suspension (with 225/45/17 tires) is good enough that the upgrade seems unnecessary. While the interior and some mechanical changes say ''cheaper,'' the performance on a demanding road still says ''sport sedan.''
The engine on the SE and SEL is a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder rated at 170 horsepower. The engine is a bit noisy but adequately deals with the car's unloaded weight of about 3,100 pounds.
Volkswagen says acceleration from a stop to 60 miles per hour will take about 8.5 seconds with the 6-speed automatic and 8.2 seconds with the 5-speed manual.
On my test car, the automatic transmission worked well in the normal ''drive'' mode, and it was smart enough to find the right gear and steadfastly hold it during mountain ascents. The gearbox can also be shifted manually by tapping the shift lever. A third option is Sport mode, which brings on downshifts more quickly and delays upshifts to provide greater acceleration.
There was a minor annoyance in sport mode: when lifting off the gas, the transmission tended to downshift for no apparent reason, providing a little powertrain hiccup in an otherwise smooth performance. The Environmental Protection Agency economy estimate for the automatic is 24 miles per gallon in city driving and 31 on the highway. That compares with 25 m.p.g. city and 36 m.p.g. highway for the less powerful Civic. For a 250-mile interstate cruise at speeds of 65 to 75 m.p.h., I averaged 31 m.p.g.
Previously, all Jettas came with the 5-cylinder engine. But to make the S model more affordable, Volkswagen turned on the way-back machine and retrieved a vintage 2-liter 4-cylinder rated at 115 horsepower. Therefore, the base Jetta now lags competitors including the Corolla (132 horsepower), Elantra (138) and Civic (140).
Volkswagen says this 4-cylinder's last American appearance was in the 2005 New Beetle. Before that it was used in the Jetta from 1999 to 2004. I did not have an opportunity to try the 4-cylinder Jetta S. In a critique at caranddriver.com, David Gluckman wrote of it: ''The 2.0-equipped Jetta S is certainly slower and seriously decontented versus the more expensive Jettas, but it's by no means a penalty box.'' VW says it will take 9.8 seconds for the 4-cylinder Jetta with a manual transmission to reach 60 m.p.h., and 11 seconds with the 6-speed automatic.
Two other engines will be offered. One is the generally admired 2-liter diesel power plant, with turbo direct injection. That 140-horsepower motor will be available later this year.
Early next year, a turbocharged 2-liter direct-injection 4 cylinder, rated at 200 horsepower -- currently found in the sporty GTI -- will be available in a higher-performance Jetta GLI model. Both the GLI and the TDI will have a dual-clutch automatic transmission.
Volkswagen says it will also offer a hybrid Jetta in 2012.
While VWs are typically seen as more distinctive than Toyotas or Hondas, questions remain about the brand's reliability. In a 2010 study of how three-year-old vehicles held up, VW ranked near the bottom over all, according to J. D. Power. But Consumer Reports magazine says the 2008 Jetta with the 2.5-liter engine had better-than-average reliability; the 2009 Jetta was rated average.
All Jettas are assembled in Mexico. Mr. Christopher, the Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was working hard to improve quality.
The 2011 Jetta is simultaneously a vexing and yet alluring creation. Under economic pressure, Volkswagen has arguably taken a step back in engineering, and it has cheapened an interior that was once an industry benchmark. On the other hand, the Jetta remains engaging and satisfying to drive. For some car buyers, the big drop in price may easily offset the backsliding.
INSIDE TRACK: Volkswagen giveth, and Volkswagen taketh away.

HEADLINE: Annemarie G. DiCola

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Ms. DiCola is the chief executive of Trepp, a private analytics company based in New York that tracks the market for commercial real estate financing, from commercial mortgage-backed securities, or C.M.B.S., to bank lending.
Trepp's clients include brokerage firms, commercial banks, asset managers and institutional investors.
Q Did you branch into bank-lending data because the C.M.B.S. market virtually shut down? 
A Even before the economic turmoil started in '07 we had begun to extend out from our C.M.B.S. focus. We acquired Foresight Analytics earlier this year, and Foresight had a database of 30 years' worth of tracking bank loans and bank exposure to commercial real estate lending.
Q What kind of information can be derived from your databases?
A We tell clients how all the loans under a bond are performing: Did the loans make the monthly payments? Was there an appraisal reduction?
A bond investor can track the ongoing performance of the bond by digging in and looking at the loans backing the bonds. Bond issuers can compare their commercial mortgage loans against the universe of C.M.B.S. loans.
Q Who are some of your clients?
A We have over 700 institutional clients globally, including all the issuers of C.M.B.S. We have all the major broker dealers, asset managers, hedge funds, etc. A very big client is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Q Trepp is monitoring the Fed's TALF, or Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, program, designed to jump-start the debt-securitization markets with attractive financing for those who bought the securities. Was the program successful?
A The program worked because that investment did take place, and investment and issuance outside the TALF program also began to take place. C.M.B.S. prices began to stabilize, and some of the loans are already getting repaid.
Q Are commercial real estate deals getting securitized again?
A Yes, we already had issuances this year. We believe the market's on track to end the year with about $10 billion worth of C.M.B.S. issuance.
Q How would that compare with previous years?
A Of course this is a pittance compared to '06 and '07 -- '07 was $237.6 billion, which was the peak -- but it's a good start. Last year it was $2.4 billion.
So far there have been about 13 deals, and we know of about 5 of 6 more in the pipeline.
Q Is it still difficult to get real estate projects financed?
A Properties in higher-performing markets, like New York, Chicago, D.C., and within all markets, the Class A properties are able to find financing. Class B and C properties in secondary and tertiary markets are having difficulty. And we're finding that the loans are being conservatively underwritten.
Q Trepp also tracks loan delinquencies. Are the numbers improving?
A The numbers are still increasing, but the pace is slowing.
Q How is New York faring?
A New York City is performing better than the national average on all sectors. The total outstanding C.M.B.S. issuance in Manhattan was $65.4 billion as of the end of August, and of this, $5.2 billion is delinquent 30 days or more. So the delinquency rate is 7.89 percent, compared to 8.92 percent on a national basis.
But removing Stuytown -- which represents 58 percent of all New York City's delinquency volume -- reduces the delinquency rate to 3.46 percent.
Q What went wrong with Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village?
A The underlying problem -- and Stuytown is not a unique property in this respect -- was extremely aggressive underwriting that utilized ''pro forma loan projection,'' based on projected income. In the Stuytown case, that assumed a number of rent-stabilized apartments would convert to market-level rents, which did not prove to be the case.
Q How did you get involved in the commercial debt business?
A I had been a commercial real estate attorney and I had brought Trepp to my law firm as a client in the late '80s. I joined Trepp as general counsel in 1990. I was involved in everything -- every strategy meeting, every marketing decision. I've been C.E.O. since April 2005.
Q Your husband's family owns Patsy's Italian Restaurant in Manhattan and Patsy's specialty food products. Have you learned any good recipes?
A I'm a much better eater than I am a cook. My husband makes the best linguine with white clam sauce that I've ever tasted! Ever! He learned it from his grandfather, Pasquale, who was nicknamed Patsy.

HEADLINE: Working to Keep a Heritage Relevant

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
HAMBURG, Pa. -- To millions of Americans, autumn means not just N.F.L. games and the World Series but also the start of hunting season -- a few months packed with chances to stalk deer, bear, ducks and doves with rifles, shotguns, bows and even black-powder muskets.
''Hunting is one of those sports where you can't have too much stuff,'' said Dan Gechtman, 46, one of many customers streaming into Cabela's, a hunting and fishing megastore here, on a balmy afternoon. ''This store is on steroids,'' he said while trying on a camouflage suit that fluttered with artificial leaves and taking in the dazzling array of products, stuffed animal dioramas and a laser-shooting arcade. 
In some rural areas, hunting is still so universal that schools close on the opening day of deer season. President Obama, in a ritual White House act requested by sporting fans and manufacturers, proclaimed Saturday National Hunting and Fishing Day. But as the hunters revel in their preparations for their annual forays into the wild, hunting enthusiasts are gearing up to reverse the long-term dwindling of their ranks.
As the nation becomes more urban and teenagers seek other recreation, the popularity of hunting is declining. The latest federal survey, in 2006, found that 12.5 million people hunt each year, down from 17 million in 1975. Other studies suggest that perhaps 18 million people hunt occasionally, but in any case, hunters represent a shrinking part of the population.
The graying ranks and the impulses that have sustained stores like Cabela's, even in the recession, are typified by Gerard Dick, 72, who has hunted since childhood and through a career as a high school science teacher. He owns plenty of weapons, he said, but on Thursday afternoon he was checking out a small rifle with a camouflage-covered stock.
''I'll use it on turkeys and groundhogs,'' he said.
The decline in hunters is a concern for state fish and game agencies, which are financed through licenses and excise taxes on sporting goods, as well as for pro-hunting conservation groups and advocates like the National Rifle Association.
''We're concerned that in the future we aren't going to have adequate dollars to manage our wildlife resources,'' said John E. Frampton, director of South Carolina's Department of Natural Resources and president of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. ''We also want to preserve an important part of our heritage.''
Mr. Frampton serves on a new federal advisory board intended ''to help promote and preserve America's hunting heritage for future generations,'' in part by drawing in more youths and women.
While declining interest and shrinking wildlife habitat may be the main threats to the pastime, hunting and gun groups are worried by the occasional efforts to restrict it, like the ban on mourning dove hunting in Michigan that was promoted by animal rights advocates.
South Carolina is one of four states, along with Arizona, Arkansas and Tennessee, that will vote this fall on adding the right to hunt and fish to their constitutions. Ten states already have such provisions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
None of these long-term worries were on the mind of Victor Hakes, 53, as he wandered in Cabela's on Thursday afternoon with his wife, Shawna, and their grandson after making a two-hour drive from northern Pennsylvania. Mr. Hakes, who builds custom trailers, bags deer and turkeys every year but has not yet shot a bear, ''although I passed over two cubs,'' he said.
On this trip he was just buying boots, but his eyes shifted toward the gun racks. ''I've got 10 rifles and shotguns, and she won't let me buy any more,'' he said, nudging his wife with a laugh.
Their 3-year-old grandson, Aiden Jaeger, looked with wide eyes at a huge stuffed moose. ''He'll be a hunter and a fisherman,'' Mr. Hakes said, expressing a hope that Aiden would buck the national trend and carry on a family tradition.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P.'s 'Pledge'

 BODY:
Extravagant promises and bluster are the stuff of campaign rhetoric, but the House Republicans' ''Pledge to America'' goes far beyond the norm.
Its breathless mimicry of the Declaration of Independence -- the ''governed do not consent,'' it declares, while vowing to rein in ''an arrogant and out-of-touch government of self-appointed elites'' -- would be ludicrous, if these were not destructively polarized times.
While it promises to create jobs, control deficit spending and restore Americans' trust in government, it is devoid of tough policy choices. This new ''governing agenda'' does not say how the Republicans would replace revenue that would be lost from permanently extending all of the Bush tax cuts, or how they would manage Medicare and Social Security, or even which discretionary programs would go when they slash $100 billion in spending. Their record at all of these things is dismal.
The best way to understand the pledge is as a bid to co-opt the Tea Party by a Republican leadership that wants to sound insurrectionist but is the same old Washington elite. These are the folks who slashed taxes on the rich, turned a surplus into a crushing deficit, and helped unleash the financial crisis that has thrown millions of Americans out of their jobs and their homes. 
Not only are the players the same, the policies are the same. Just more tax cuts for the rich and more deficit spending. We find it hard to believe that even the most disaffected voters will be taken in. But again, these are strange and worrying times.
Still, the pledge was worth a careful reading. It is a reminder that there is a choice to be made this fall.
THE BUDGET DEFICIT The Republicans' central claim is that they will be able to reduce the budget deficit, while cutting taxes deeply and making marginal cuts in spending. That pledge is impossible to keep. There is no chance of reducing the deficit without tax increases. The budget has been chronically short of revenue since the start of the Bush-era tax cuts, and more indiscriminate cutting will only dig the hole deeper.
Cutting the deficit will also require curbs on the government's biggest and most popular entitlement programs -- Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, collectively 40 percent of the budget. Ditto military spending, another 20 percent. Yet Republicans pledge to shield seniors, veterans and the troops from spending cuts.
It is difficult to put an exact number on the size of the deficits and debt implied by the pledge, because the details are sketchy. What is known is that if current tax and spending policies continue, the deficit (currently estimated at $1.3 trillion) will double in size as a share of the economy in the decades to come.
TAXES AND TAX CUTS The Republicans' pledge also fails to mention that President Obama has already called for extending the tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpayers (couples making up to $250,000 and individuals making up to $200,000).
So what the pledge is really advocating is a permanent extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent. In all, the pledge's tax proposal would add $3.7 trillion to the nation's debt over the next 10 years, nearly $700 billion more than the administration's proposal.
The drive for permanent high-end tax cuts is profligate; there is no other word for it. The nation cannot afford it. We are fighting a war in Afghanistan and only now winding down the war in Iraq. The baby boom generation is about to retire. To keep competing, the country needs enormous investment in infrastructure, energy alternatives, education and basic research.
The pledge asserts that letting the high-end tax cuts expire would kill job creation. With the economy weak, letting all the tax cuts expire would be a big hit to consumer spending and, by extension, job growth. But richer Americans tend to save, not spend, their tax cuts. Of 11 ways to boost the economy analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, preserving the high-end tax cuts ranked last.
Republicans also assert that letting the high-end cuts expire would devastate small businesses. But less than 3 percent of taxpayers with business income would be affected. Republicans claim that 50 percent of small-business income would be hit. The only way to get that number is by including ''small businesses'' like some major law firms, investment funds, actors and athletes -- hardly Main Street.
In any case, business owners do not typically base their hiring decisions on their income tax rate. If the top tax rates reverted to the pre-Bush levels, wealthy owners would keep less of the additional profit. But if a hire is profitable before tax, it will be profitable after tax. Undeterred by facts, the pledge would let small-business owners deduct 20 percent of their business income. Given the Republicans' broad definition, that implies another big tax cut -- an estimated $25 billion over two years -- flowing to many high earners.
SPENDING The Republicans' document promises the American people a ''fact based'' discussion of the scale of the nation's budget problems. Then it offers a laundry list of spending-cut proposals, none of which are up to the scale of the problem, and many that cannot be taken seriously.
Calling the $862 billion stimulus wasteful and unnecessary, it says Congress should immediately cancel any unspent funds. Never mind that the stimulus, while too small given the depth of the crisis, still prevented a bad recession from being much worse.
There is also not much to cancel. Of roughly $260 billion left, contracts have already been signed for $150 billion. Another $45 billion is tax cuts that will soon be claimed, and $33 billion is for safety-net spending, like food stamps. That leaves $31 billion in investment projects -- like roads and rail systems -- still up for grabs. At a time when the private sector is not creating enough jobs, canceling them would be a mistake.
The House Republicans also promise to roll back spending, saving $100 billion in the first year alone. There are no details, but the proposal appears to reflect an earlier Republican proposal to cut programs like education, food safety and environmental protection.
Even in the best of times, it would be disastrous to slash such vital programs. Right now, it would also remove purchasing power, cost jobs and heighten the risk of a prolonged downturn.
The Republicans also say they will save taxpayers $30 billion by ending the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A serious debate on the future of the huge mortgage companies needs to take place. Currently, however, they own or back most new mortgages. Cutting them loose too soon would risk further damage to the wounded housing market.
Then there is the bank bailout, or TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. which the pledge vows to end ''once and for all,'' for a savings of $16 billion. What it does not say is that new TARP spending was basically outlawed in the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill passed in July.
HEALTH CARE REFORM The Republican plan to ''repeal and replace'' the new reform law is set forth in a skimpy chapter that fails to offer any real alternative to cover uninsured Americans or reduce medical inflation.
The pledge contains a few golden G.O.P. oldies: medical liability reform that will probably not save serious money; allowing Americans to purchase insurance issued in other states, which could bring down premiums for the healthy while driving them up for the chronically ill; and expanding so-called health savings accounts that are useful for some Americans but not all.
At the same time as they revile reform, the authors embrace, or at least pretend to, some of the most popular, consumer-friendly features of the law, like eliminating spending caps and prohibitions against dropping your coverage just because you get sick. The Republicans say they would provide incentives to states to develop innovative reforms; that, too, is already in the law.
The pledge document does not mention the Republicans' plan -- should repeal fail -- to block the annual appropriations needed to carry out reform. That just-say-no approach is flat-out irresponsible. The health care reforms are so intertwined that it is hard to eliminate one provision without undermining others.
Americans are right to be worried and even angry about the bad economy. And they are right to demand that Washington do a lot more to revive employment now and start to reduce the deficit soon. But these are hard problems built up over eight years of mainly Republican leadership. The pledge takes the country backward -- a place no one should want to go.

HEADLINE: Advantage, Landlord

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
TO the chagrin of many renters in New York City, the balance of power in the rental market has tipped back toward landlords -- if not far enough for landlords to start celebrating quite yet.
At the beginning of the year, renters could demand and receive a month of free rent and maybe even get the landlord to pay their broker's fees. Those concessions, now the exception rather than the rule, are mainly found in brand-new apartment towers whose owners are hoping to fill them quickly. Overall vacancy rates are again hovering around 1 percent, where they were during the boom. Some landlords have started to push for rent increases.
Still, even though rates as tracked by Citi Habitats have declined steadily since late last year and had hovered below 1 percent for several months, the rate increased from 0.8 percent in July to 1.1 percent in August -- a discouraging sign for landlords, since August is traditionally one of the busiest months for rentals.
Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats, said the summer uptick was surprising. But he also said that even though prices remain flat, ''landlords are back in the driver's seat.'' 
Landlords, he said, ''did what they needed to do last year, but they're not giving money away this year, and threatening to leave doesn't threaten owners as much as it did a year ago.''
Mr. Malin said that some rent renewal letters ''may look aggressive to the tenants' eyes, but landlords are only doing what they see happening in the current marketplace.''
Mr. Malin gave an extreme example: A friend recently called him for help because his landlord had demanded a rent increase of $1,400 a month. He had helped place the friend in the $3,400-a-month two-bedroom apartment in 2009 when the landlord was eager to fill the space.
Mr. Malin and his unhappy friend looked at comparable apartments, ''and unfortunately for him,'' Mr. Malin said, ''what we concluded was he got an amazing deal last year where he was basically paying a one-bedroom price for a two-bedroom.''
Mr. Malin broke the news as gently as he could. ''While it was a big dollar amount to swallow,'' he said, ''it is what those apartments are renting for now.''
The friend signed the new lease.
A more typical scenario might involve someone who rented a $3,000-a-month apartment last year but received two months of free rent, bringing the net effective rent down to $2,500 a month. Most landlords in this situation will probably try to renew the lease this year at $3,000 a month, without incentives, although they might be willing to meet the renter halfway.
Still, any hopes among landlords that rents will rise significantly could be stymied by the city's employment picture.
Marc Lewis, the president of Century 21 NY Metro, said that landlords to whom he had spoken in recent weeks were not terribly sanguine. ''The general feeling is that things are not good because the summer season was much shorter than in the past and there were fewer transactions,'' he said. Many landlords, he added, ''think we're in for a tough winter and they're not very optimistic about the next six months.''
Business may have declined because landlords have pulled back on incentives, he said, ''but the bigger reason is simply lack of jobs.'' Judging by the rental applications that his brokers helped process in recent months, he said, ''there are a lot less people coming into the city with new jobs, and a lot less banking and technology jobs than we saw in the last few years.''
The New York City Independent Budget Office has projected slow employment growth in the city through 2011 and does not anticipate a return to pre-downturn levels until mid-2013.
The budget office's data on the size of the city's labor force, which includes everyone who is employed or looking for work, also mirror the strengthening rental market earlier in 2010 and the recent weakening. The size of the labor force had dropped through most of 2009 and had finally started to grow again in February 2010, approaching 4 million people. But the number fell by 14,000 in July, and in August grew by only about 2,000. (In August 2008, the last month before the economic meltdown, the city's labor force grew by 7,500.)
Landlords who were emboldened to stop offering rental concessions earlier in the year ''maybe were sensing the jobs picture improving and may have been reacting to that,'' said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the budget office. The growing vacancy rate in August may also be a reaction to the falloff in the labor force in July, he said.
Some landlords are asking more from renters during the application process. Brokers at the Real Estate Group New York have noticed that landlords in smaller buildings in particular are requiring a guarantor or more money upfront, either as prepaid rent or a bigger security deposit, said Andrew Barrocas, the company's chief executive.
''Landlords generally seem much more cautious now when they're renting to new hires,'' Mr. Barrocas said. ''Three years ago, just having an offer letter from a Fortune 100 company was enough to get an apartment. Now landlords wonder if that person will really have a job.''
Brokers are hopeful, though, that the market will strengthen in 2011, when fewer new rental buildings will be coming to market. About 2,000 rental units now under construction are to be completed next year, roughly half the inventory added in 2010, said Cliff Finn, the director of new development marketing for Citi Habitats.
The relative scarcity of new buildings will very likely keep down the vacancy rate, Mr. Finn said. ''If it's not so easy to go to the next thing, people may want to stay put longer.'' A decrease in rentals with incentives could also cut down on bargaining in general. ''Right now, when we have a dozen or so new buildings giving one or two months' free rent, it's pretty hard to negotiate a renewal and not get at least something,'' he said. ''Next year, when you don't have as many new buildings, it'll be a different story.''
For now, at least, incentives like free rent seem to be fading away.
Glenwood Management, which owns about two dozen luxury rental buildings throughout Manhattan, stopped offering free rent in March and is now paying broker fees at only half of its buildings. Gary Jacob, a Glenwood executive vice president, said that other building owners were similarly ''experimenting building by building taking away the owner-paid broker fee.'' And once tenants are back to routinely paying broker commissions, he added, ''that will be a sign that the market is as strong as it was three years ago.''
Another luxury rental landlord, TF Cornerstone, is paying broker fees at only one of its nine buildings: its newest, 505 West 37th Street. ''Over all we're seeing tremendously better traffic than we did a year ago,'' said Scott Walsh, the marketing director at TF Cornerstone.
''We're not paying broker's fees in established buildings where we don't have a lot of inventory,'' he said. ''But if we have a number of two-bedrooms building up somewhere, we might elect to pay it in that one property, just to get brokers to show it and help us market it.''
Deal or No Deal? Depends on the Neighborhood
BROKERS and landlords agree that the rental market in New York City behaves differently from neighborhood to neighborhood. Renters hoping to renew a lease in one area might easily negotiate a lower rent increase, while in another, landlords may charge what they know the market will bear, even if it means driving away a tenant.
East and West Village -- Brokers say that because everyone seems to want to live south of 14th Street, these neighborhoods were the first to bounce back. Landlords stopped paying broker fees months ago, and concessions are nonexistent.
Midtown West and Downtown Brooklyn -- Landlords at many of the new apartment buildings in these neighborhoods are still offering to pay broker fees, and in some cases free rent for a month or two. A renter who signed a lease last year for a $3,000-a-month apartment with two months of free rent effectively paid only $2,500 a month. At renewal time that renter will be looking at a new lease for $3,000. But depending on the number of vacant units in the building, the landlord may be willing to negotiate.
Upper East Side -- Renters may be able to negotiate deals, because the area has the highest vacancy rate in the city. According to Citi Habitats, the rate on the Upper East Side is 1.8 percent, significantly higher than the 0.5 percent in the West Village. Rents are generally lower as well. The average rent for a studio is $1,711 on the Upper East Side and $2,175 in the West Village.

HEADLINE: Opening Up An Elite Brand To the Masses

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
ONCE a year, there is a mass migration of the intelligentsia to Long Beach, Calif.
There, inside the Long Beach Performing Arts Center, a block from the Pacific Ocean, they gather for four days to share ideas and score gift bags at the TED Conference. Sold out a year in advance, the conference has scholars, scientists, musicians as speakers. They are boldface names: Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, Jane Goodall. And as for any A-list party, an invitation is required.
The price to get in: $6,000.
Unable to meet the growing demand for access to TED, its organizers decided to democratize. They imagined a new conference that was TED but not TED, organized by local groups like schools, businesses, neighborhoods, even friends -- at an unTED-like price: free. 
And so last year the TED principals introduced a new concept called TEDx. They encouraged would-be organizers to apply for free licenses, and hoped for the best.
''It wasn't clear at all that it would work,'' said Chris Anderson, the curator of TED, which takes its name from the conference's original areas of focus: technology, entertainment and design. He figured the inaugural year would bring 10 to 30 TEDx events, primarily in the United States.
To his surprise, there were 278 events last year in places as near as New Jersey and Florida, and as far as Estonia and China. There was TEDxKibera, held in one of Africa's largest shantytowns in Nairobi, Kenya. And there was TEDxNASA, which had space-themed lectures.
Already this year there have been 531 TEDx events. Another nearly 750 are to take place this year and beyond.
''Students can't afford to go to TED,'' said Marina Kim, 27, who in 2009 organized TEDxAshokaU -- part of Ashoka, a network of social entrepreneurs based in Arlington, Va. -- and is planning a TEDx event for February. ''The power of TEDx is that people can spread the same message but it's user-generated,'' she said.
Many TED and TEDx talks can be seen free on the Web, where they are the antipode of the viral videos of laughing cats and dancing babies that entertain millions of bored office workers each day. And yet the TED videos, too, have gone viral -- viewed more than 319 million times since they went online in 2006.
There are TEDx talks about math curriculums, health care and mastering the work-life balance. Often, they capture the local flavor of the city in which they are held, like the TEDx event about breaking down walls held on and around the Great Wall of China. Rarely are they as polished as TED talks, though the best ones end up on TED.com. They can be gatherings of more than 1,000 people, or a few friends in a sparse room. But as is the case with TED, the most powerful events use multimedia, humor and audience interaction to make lectures about serious topics inspiring and easy to grasp.
Take Hans Rosling, a physician and a professor of international health at Karolinska Institute in Sweden. He has spoken at both TED and at TEDx about economic development, health and poverty by narrating eye-catching animations of United Nations statistics as if he were a sportscaster at the Kentucky Derby.
On Monday he spoke at the Paley Center for Media in New York during TEDx Change, a conference organized by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, about the progress of the global health goals set forth a decade ago by the United Nations.
Behind him was a large digital graph showing the relationship between child mortality and family size. A box of countries labeled ''Western'' had lower child mortality rates, while a box of countries labeled ''Developing'' had higher child mortality rates. Visualization software he developed (known as Trendalyzer) sent orbs representing various countries floating across the graph while time fast-forwarded from 1960 to today. Dr. Rosling spoke faster and faster, narrating what was happening as time flew by: ''Now you get eradication of smallpox, better education, health services -- There! China comes into the Western box here! And here Brazil is in the Western box! India's approaching! The first African country's coming into the Western box! And we get a lot of new neighbors. Welcome to a decent life!'' (Video of the presentation is on the Gates Foundation's Web site.)
If you think that was a unique way to enliven statistics, consider the 2007 TED talk at which Dr. Rosling wanted to show attendees that the seemingly impossible was possible -- so he swallowed a sword.
''We rehearse and rehearse in my hotel room,'' he said in the lobby of the Paley Center after his TEDxChange talk. ''Twenty-five times.'' (And that was for a sword-free lecture.) Then he reached into his breast pocket and flashed a reporter a Boy Scout-style sword swallower's badge.
Also at TEDxChange was Mechai Viravaidya, a former senator in Thailand known as Mr. Condom. He shared his unusual tactics to teach Thai people about family planning and H.I.V. and AIDS prevention, including asking police officers to dole out condoms, organizing condom-inflating competitions and selling condoms and caffeine at a Coffee & Condom stall. Efforts like these helped new H.I.V. and AIDS infections in Thailand decline by 90 percent between 1991 and 2003, he said, saving millions of lives.
When Melinda French Gates of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was asked what she hoped the people watching live via Webcast in 40 countries would take away from that particular TEDx event, she replied, ''that change is possible.''
The first-ever TEDx was in March 2009 at the University of Southern California, organized by Krisztina Holly, vice provost for innovation at the University of Southern California and executive director of U.S.C.'s Stevens Institute for Innovation. She held a second event this year, selling out all 1,200 available seats and turning away hundreds of people.
''Students were just beating down the door wanting to sign up,'' said Ms. Holly, who goes by ''Z.'' ''We actually had a student write in his application that the whole reason the student came to U.S.C. was TEDx.''
Yet she pointed out that just a year ago, TEDx was a major risk because TED's organizers had to relinquish control. On the other hand, TEDx is an example of a new model of business plans that harness fans of the brand to help it evolve.
Mr. Anderson agreed, though he said the looming questions were ''How do you avoid damaging the TED brand? Can you package TED in a box?''
Apparently you can. A TEDx license is required to organize an event. The rules: recipients must not be associated with a controversial or extremist group, and cannot use TEDx to promote religious or political beliefs, or to sell commercial goods. There are also rules governing the event format, including that speakers must be filmed and that they don't speak for more than 18 minutes each. TEDx organizers cannot charge for tickets, though TED makes some exceptions for groups that need help with production costs. Organizers who want to charge a fee (which can't exceed $100) must seek permission from TED.
Today, TED executives are looking to the next phase of growth: leveraging TEDx as an educational tool.
''We know teachers are using the talks in classrooms,'' said Lara Stein, TED's licensing director. ''What could we do to move that along?''
After all, as Mr. Anderson pointed out, the rise of online video means a teacher doesn't have to be someone sitting in front of a classroom talking to 30 people. Especially if something like TEDx can make learning and social change ''sexy,'' as Ms. Kim of Ashoka put it.
''It's an experience,'' she said. ''It's not a lecture. It's transformational. That's why people like me are hooked.''

HEADLINE: Learning to Share, Thanks to the Web

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Can Americans share? Or, at least, not steal?
That question hung over the rows of identical fire-red bicycles lined up last week for the start of Capital Bikeshare in Washington, the nation's largest bike-sharing program.
Similar programs also began this year in Denver and Minneapolis, with another to start in Miami this fall. At the same time, start-up companies with names like SnapGoods, Share Some Sugar and NeighborGoods are trying to make money by using social networks to let people borrow or lend their stuff, either free or for a fee. 
These companies are looking to join a familiar list -- including Netflix, Zipcar and Pandora, the online radio service -- built on access to goods and services, rather than ownership.
But the question is whether most consumers would ever accept time share ownership of a bike or a blender. After a bike share program began in Denver, one gubernatorial candidate in Colorado attacked the program as un-American.
But some scholars say that the Internet -- by fostering collaboration on a communal, open platform -- has changed the way Americans think about sharing and ownership. Collaborative habits online are beginning to find expression in the real world.
''I thought that online was an exception,'' said Yochai Benkler, co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, whose coming book, ''The Penguin and the Leviathan,'' focuses on the explosion of cooperative endeavors, both online and off. ''I now am more confident that the phenomenon is not limited to online but is a general phenomenon of human behavior.''
So far, he said, there have been no formal studies into whether the Internet has affected offline cooperation or attitudes about ownership.
But an ethic of sharing has long found a place in the United States, like cooperative farming and car-pooling, which is the second most common form of commuting. Bike sharing, too, is nothing new. Early efforts, beginning with shared bikes on college campuses in the 1960s and early 1970s, relied mostly on trust. That model worked in some small towns like Crested Butte, Colo., but tended to collapse quickly in urban environments. (In 2005, a bike-sharing program started in Edmonton, Canada; 95 percent of its bikes were stolen after three years.)
The bike share programs now spreading to cities like Paris, Washington and Hangzhou, China, follow a subscription model and use electronic tracking to deter theft. (By contrast, college campuses use a library model, with bikes loaned for extended periods of time.)
And like most share programs, a credit card is required for collateral. There may also be membership fees and escalating usage charges. (The first 30 minutes are generally free.) So, while it may be sharing, its success is based on technology -- and a deposit.
Companies trying to make money from what is called collaborative consumption are not very big and very new. Each counts its members in the thousands, and together they have a few million dollars in goods available to share.
But it is surprising that consumers are even willing to try it. ''Everyone thought we were completely crazy two years ago,'' said Micki Krimmel, 32, the founder of NeighborGoods, a sharing service. She said her success was based on a ''a desire for community, a desire to be more sustainable and, frankly, it's the economy.''
Publishers have taken note, with books like Lisa Gansky's ''The Mesh: Why the Future of Business Is Sharing'' and Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers's ''What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption,'' published this month.
In a 1968 essay, ''The Tragedy of the Commons,'' Garrett Hardin wrote that resources held in common would inevitably be ruined by individual self-interest and therefore needed forceful regulation.
But scholars like Elinor Ostrom, a professor of political science at Indiana University and a Nobelist in economics, are revisiting this thesis. Her research focused on instances in which social norms and local understandings led groups to share scarce resources. In other words, people don't always misuse or destroy the commons simply because it doesn't belong to them personally.
Yet in the case of shared bicycles, sustainability is still in question. In Paris, vandalism and theft have plagued the city's bike share program, started in 2007, with most of its 20,000 bikes needing either repair or replacement. ''The symbol of a fixed-up, eco-friendly city has become a new source for criminality,'' the newspaper Le Monde wrote in an editorial last year.
And in a nod to our darker side, some advocates of sharing are betting that success is based on, well, self-interest.
''Sharing takes away all the headaches of ownership, and people see that pretty clearly,'' said Parry Burnap, executive director of Denver Bike Sharing, a nonprofit that runs the program.
It's a sentiment echoed by Lauren Statman, 23, a Washington resident investigating a bike station last Sunday. She just started biking again this month, she said, but is between jobs and not likely to buy her own bike right now.
''It seems cool,'' she said, ''because you don't have to commit.''

HEADLINE: Auction World's Blast Of Brash

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
IN 2006 when the market for contemporary art was red hot and dealers and collectors spent hours jockeying to be first in the door at Art Basel, the world's most important contemporary art fair, Philippe Segalot could be seen hanging back, his manner calm and self-assured. That's because Mr. Segalot, a private New York dealer, had pulled the stunt of all art-world stunts. He hired a Hollywood makeup artist to fly to Basel, Switzerland, and transform him into a balding nerd with Coke-bottle glasses. Then, using a fake exhibitor's pass with his new face on it, he sneaked past the phalanx of security guards and into the fair days before it opened, reserving the best artworks for his clients well ahead of anyone else. 
Mr. Segalot, 47, does not do things the way others do. Before becoming a private dealer, he ran the contemporary art department at Christie's, where he pioneered the sale of works by Jeff Koons and Maurizio Cattelan before they were art stars. And although artists traditionally shun the public forum of auctions, he talked many of them into becoming involved in the sales, installing their own work in Christie's headquarters. Then, to promote the events -- and lure a new generation of younger buyers into the auction house -- he turned Christie's into a discotheque, holding theme parties like ''Bubble Bash'' and ''Think Pink.''
Now Mr. Segalot has undertaken a new challenge: to transform Phillips, de Pury & Company, the struggling auction house, into a winner, at least for one night. Like a guest curator at a museum, Mr. Segalot has put together an evening contemporary art auction that will take place on Nov. 8 in New York. It will inaugurate the opening of Phillips's new 25,000 square-foot space at Park Avenue and 57th Street.
Enlisting an outside expert to organize a sale of contemporary art is a first in the auction world and the start of what officials at Phillips say will be a continuing program called Carte Blanche. For an auction house whose manpower and reach are considerably smaller than those of the giants Sotheby's and Christie's, it is considered a creative maneuver for a business that has been fighting to survive.
Once again Mr. Segalot has resorted to unexpected transformations. Before he had a sculpture by Mr. Cattelan -- a bust of Stephanie Seymour, the model who is in the middle of a much-publicized messy marriage and on-again off-again divorce from the newsprint magnate Peter Brant -- photographed for the cover of the sale catalog, he enlisted Frederic Fekkai, hairdresser to the stars (including Ms. Seymour), to style the sculpture's long and luscious mix of synthetic and real tresses.
''Stephanie is the ultimate fantasy,'' Mr. Segalot said recently as he sipped a Coca-Cola on a sofa in his Upper East Side apartment, an immaculate modern space filled with artworks by Mr. Cattelan, Takashi Murakami, Cindy Sherman, Robert Morris and Daniel Buren, all artists included in his sale. ''When I asked Maurizio how best to install the sculpture he told me that the hair was a crucial element. And since I knew Frederic I thought there was no harm in asking for his help.'' (Mr. Segalot's own hair, by the way, is perhaps his most recognizable feature: it is dark brown, layered and blown dry to perfection. And to dispel rumors that, like the sculpture's perfectly coiffed hair, it too is fake, a reporter actually pulled it.) When the sculpture was unpacked from its crate Mr. Fekkai said it looked ''scary,'' the hair a tangle of knots.
''It took a long time just to brush it out gently with a special gloss so it wouldn't frizz,'' he said. Although he has styled countless wigs, this was a first for him. ''The way the hair falls can change the shape of a face, even a sculpture,'' he added. ''We wanted to make her look like a goddess.''
That a celebrity hairdresser had been called in to the Phillips auction house to style a sculpture did not faze Simon de Pury, the chairman of Phillips. ''Philippe is a great personality,'' he said, adding that during his years at Christie's Mr. Segalot never conformed to the profile of his more staid and often corporate colleagues. ''I remember when Christie's held the Pink Party, Philippe greeted guests wearing a long Pink Panther tail hanging from his jacket,'' he said. ''The thing about Philippe is that he is actually very professional, but there is always an element of fun in everything he does.''
Ever since the Mercury Group, a Russian retailing giant, bought the controlling stake in the company two years ago, Phillips has been striving to become more creative, holding theme auctions like BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) as a way to capitalize on emerging markets. It is also opening up sleek new salesrooms, first in London and now on Park Avenue. But this auction in particular, Mr. de Pury said, ''could be a game changer for us.'' Every season it is generally Phillips that trails far behind Sotheby's and Christie's both in the amount of art it is able to sell and in the calendar of a relentless week of back-to-back auctions in New York every May and November. But this season it reserved Monday night, kicking off the contemporary art season.
''Phillips is trying to be innovative,'' said Adam Lindemann, a New York collector and author of the 2006 book ''Collecting Contemporary.'' ''Philippe has a quick Rolodex and good relationships. He's going to work it.''
It will also be a sale with significantly higher prices. Since Mr. de Pury, a former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, first became involved with Phillips a decade ago, the company has never sold more than about $59 million worth of art in an evening auction. The low estimates for the 33 works Mr. Segalot has culled for his auction add up to about $80 million.
And while nobody at either Sotheby's or Christie's would speak for attribution, saying it was ungentlemanly to badmouth the competition, there is a lot of resentment about Mr. Segalot sweeping back into the business and amping up the competition in a season when the economy is still shaky. ''It's always easy to do it once,'' one auction house expert quipped.
Organizing a sale -- convincing collectors to sell their prized artworks, producing the catalog and then finding buyers -- in just three months is a nail-biting exercise for any pro and in Mr. Segalot's case something he hardly needs to be doing. Operating from small offices in New York and Paris, the French-born Mr. Segalot, along with his two partners -- Franck Giraud, a former director of Christie's Impressionist and modern art department, and Lionel Pissarro, a great-grandson of the artist Camille Pissarro -- quietly sell millions of dollars of art every year to many of the world's richest collectors.
Yet setting challenges for himself is a kind of drug for Mr. Segalot. ''I used to enjoy what I did at Christie's, and the idea of doing it again, just once more, got me excited,'' he said in his heavy French accent and genuine, though relentlessly enthusiastic, manner. ''My business today is very private. We don't talk about our clients or our deals, and this is a way to tell the world what we do.'' That Phillips is the underdog in the cutthroat world of auctions was also appealing. ''That added to the challenge,'' he admitted. ''I liked the idea that I could change the picture for this small company.''
Ever the discreet dealer, he refuses to say where the 33 works in his sale are coming from, although rumors are swirling that he got some things directly from artists and others from his usual roster of clients, like Stefan Edlis, the Chicago collector, and Mr. Lindemann. He is even thought to have persuaded Francois Pinault, owner of Christie's, to give him an artwork or two to sell.
The sale itself is very much a reflection of Mr. Segalot's taste. ''I don't want it to look like an auction but like a private collection,'' he said. Mr. Cattelan's sculpture is one of an edition of three and an artist's proof. In 2003, before the marriage started to sour, Mr. Brant commissioned the artist to do a work for his vast collection. Looking at all his art trophies -- Warhols and Basquiats and Richard Princes -- Mr. Cattelan was inspired to create something that embodied Mr. Brant's trophy wife. But there were strings attached: ''I wanted other men to be able to share her,'' Mr. Cattelan said; hence the edition of sculptures. Mr. Segalot estimates that this particular one should fetch $1.5 million to $2 million.
Also for sale will be a careful mix of artists that rarely come to auction, like Robert Morris, Lee Lozano and Mr. Buren, as well as some emerging ones like Matthew Day Jackson. There will also be work by big names like Mr. Murakami, whose ''Miss ko2,'' one of the Japanese artist's sculptures of a fantastical waitress (it stands more than eight feet tall) is expected to bring $4 million to $6 million.
But the biggest star of all is ''Men in Her Life,'' a 1962 Warhol painting based on an image of Elizabeth Taylor when she was between husbands that may sell for around $50 million. Mr. Segalot pried the Warhol out of the private collection of the Mugrabi family, Manhattan dealers known for their vast holdings of Warhols. ''My father was adamantly opposed to selling this painting, but Philippe was so convincing,'' said Alberto Mugrabi, referring to his father, Jose. ''Philippe can do things nobody else can. He's crazy, but good crazy.''
Alberto Mugrabi has followed Mr. Segalot's career from the beginning. During the five years he spent at Christie's Mr. Segalot earned a reputation for getting record prices for artists like Charles Ray, Mr. Murakami, Mr. Koons and Felix Gonzalez-Torres by cleverly promoting them and having an impeccable sense of timing. He was the first to put contemporary furniture by designers like Marc Newson into fine art auctions. In 2000 he enlisted three art students from Bard College to install one of his sales at Christie's. ''I was too close to it,'' he recalled. ''I wanted young, talented kids to look at the art from a fresh perspective, so I gave them the run of the galleries.''
Since the company Giraud, Pissarro, Segalot was founded in 2002, Mr. Segalot has been involved in yet more record-breaking deals. Two years ago the firm pulled off what experts say is the world's biggest private art transaction, selling $400 million worth of art on behalf of the heirs of the legendary dealer Ileana Sonnabend, to help cover their estate taxes. The dealers are said to have placed works by Mr. Koons, Lichtenstein, Twombly and Warhol in the collections of some of their best clients, among them Mr. Pinault; Sammy Ofer, the Israeli shipping magnate; and Carlos Slim Helu, the Mexican telecommunications billionaire. (Again, Mr. Segalot refused to discuss these details.)
Nor will Mr. de Pury say who may follow Mr. Segalot and organize Phillips's next contemporary art auction. Among the names being bandied about are Sam Keller, the former director of Art Basel and Art Basel Miami Beach who is now director of the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, and even Mr. Brant, who has an art foundation in Greenwich, Conn.
''Everybody will bring something different to it,'' said Mr. Segalot said. Meanwhile, being something of a control freak, he is racing around seeing the catalog off to the printer, following through on last-minute details for the sale and chatting up clients. ''I can't sleep anymore,'' he confessed. ''I'm too excited.''

HEADLINE: Their Moon Shot And Ours

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
China is doing moon shots. Yes, that's plural. When I say ''moon shots'' I mean big, multibillion-dollar, 25-year-horizon, game-changing investments. China has at least four going now: one is building a network of ultramodern airports; another is building a web of high-speed trains connecting major cities; a third is in bioscience, where the Beijing Genomics Institute this year ordered 128 DNA sequencers -- from America -- giving China the largest number in the world in one institute to launch its own stem cell/genetic engineering industry; and, finally, Beijing just announced that it was providing $15 billion in seed money for the country's leading auto and battery companies to create an electric car industry, starting in 20 pilot cities. In essence, China Inc. just named its dream team of 16-state-owned enterprises to move China off oil and into the next industrial growth engine: electric cars.
Not to worry. America today also has its own multibillion-dollar, 25-year-horizon, game-changing moon shot: fixing Afghanistan. 
This contrast is not good. I was recently at a Washington Nationals baseball game. While waiting for a hot dog, I overheard the conversation behind me. A management consultant for a big national firm was telling his colleagues that his job was to ''market products to the Department of Homeland Security.'' I thought to myself: ''Oh, my! Inventing studies about terrorist threats and selling them to the U.S. government, is that an industry now?''
We're out of balance -- the balance between security and prosperity. We need to be in a race with China, not just Al Qaeda. Let's start with electric cars.
The electric car industry is pivotal for three reasons, argues Shai Agassi, the C.E.O. of Better Place, a global electric car company that next year will begin operating national electric car networks in Israel and Denmark. First, the auto industry was the foundation for America's manufacturing middle class. Second, the country that replaces gasoline-powered vehicles with electric-powered vehicles -- in an age of steadily rising oil prices and steadily falling battery prices -- will have a huge cost advantage and independence from imported oil. Third, electric cars are full of power electronics and software. ''Think of the applications industry that will be spun out from electric cars,'' says Agassi. It will be the iPhone on steroids.
Europe is using $7-a-gallon gasoline to stimulate the market for electric cars; China is using $5-a-gallon and naming electric cars as one of the industrial pillars for its five-year growth plan. And America? President Obama has directed stimulus money at electric cars, but he is unwilling to do the one thing that would create the sustained consumer pull required to grow an electric car industry here: raise taxes on gasoline. Price matters. Sure, the Moore's Law of electric cars -- ''the cost per mile of the electric car battery will be cut in half every 18 months'' -- will steadily drive the cost down, says Agassi, but only once we get scale production going. U.S. companies can do that on their own or in collaboration with Chinese ones. But God save us if we don't do it at all.
Two weeks ago, I visited the Coda Automotive battery facility in Tianjin, China -- a joint venture between U.S. innovators and investors, China's Lishen battery company and China National Offshore Oil Company. Yes, China's oil company is using profits to develop batteries.
Kevin Czinger, Coda's C.E.O., who drove me around Manhattan in his company's soon-to-be-in-production electric car last week, laid out what is going on. The backbone of the modern U.S. economy was locally made cars powered by locally produced oil. It started us on a huge growth spurt. In recent decades, though, that industry was supplanted by foreign-made cars run on foreign oil, so ''now every time we buy a car we're exporting $15,000 of capital, paying for it with borrowed money and running it on foreign energy sources,'' says Czinger. ''We've gone from autos being a middle-class-making-machine to a middle-class-destroying-machine.'' A U.S. electric car/battery industry would reverse that.
The Coda, 14,000 of which will be on the road in California over the next year and can travel 100 miles on one overnight charge, is a combination of Chinese-made batteries and complex American-system electronics -- all final-assembled in Oakland (price: $37,000). It is a win-win start-up for both countries.
If we both now create the market incentives for consumers to buy electric cars, and the plug-in infrastructure for people to drive them everywhere, it will be a win-win moon shot for both countries. The electric car industry will flourish in the U.S. and China, and together we'll tackle the next challenge: using auto battery innovations to build big storage batteries for wind and solar. However, if only China puts the gasoline prices and infrastructure in place, the industry will gravitate there. It will be a moon shot for them, a hobby for us, and you'll import your new electric car from China just like you're now importing your oil from Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: Wagner for a Song

BYLINE: By ALEX ROSS. 
Alex Ross, the music critic for The New Yorker, is the author of ''Listen to This.''

 BODY:
ON Monday night, ''Das Rheingold,'' the first part of a mammoth new production of Richard Wagner's opera cycle ''Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' will thunder down on the Metropolitan Opera. A 45-ton set will test the theater's foundations; a reported $16 million budget will test the company's finances. In the midst of economic troubles, is it seemly to spend such a vast amount on a spectacle that will be seen by a relatively small, elite audience?
Such questions inevitably arise whenever an opera company forges the ''Ring'' anew. Last season, the Los Angeles Opera completed its presentation of the cycle, spending $31 million. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors became embroiled in arguments over Wagner's anti-Semitism, and the singer David Byrne asked on his blog whether the money might have been better spent on arts education. ''There is a greater value for humanity,'' Mr. Byrne wrote, ''in empowering folks to make and create than there is in teaching them the canon.'' 
As someone who makes a living writing about what Mr. Byrne calls ''those dead guys,'' I don't accept his critique. But it's a thoughtful statement, demanding a more thoughtful answer than the bromides that classical-music advocates have dispensed in the past. It's not enough to murmur that opera is ''high culture'' or ''serious music.'' For one thing, opera has a right to be silly, and often is.
As it happens, a more effective riposte comes from Wagner himself. Amid his absurd and repulsive pronouncements on all manner of topics, you can find some acute insights into music's place in society. He did not write for the high and mighty; his music is as much a critique of power as an exercise in it. And at a time when so much cultural expression seems secondhand and retrospective, young artists have much to learn from Wagner's mad ambition.
A few words, first, on the question of money. Opera is expensive, yes, but in the latter-day annals of extravagance it wins no prize. A budget of $16 million, or even $31 million, is hardly extreme for a four-part production that will unfold over two years. (Julie Taymor and her producers are said to be spending $60 million on a ''Spider-Man'' musical, which will presumably last only one evening.) Furthermore, the money comes almost entirely from ticket sales and donations; in the financial year just ended, the Met received just $698,000 from various government sources. And the ''elite'' image is exaggerated. The average seat at the Met costs $138, which is almost exactly what people pay to see the Rolling Stones.
Yet no matter how much the Met talks up its $20 rush tickets or its movie-theater simulcast series, which reaches millions of people a year, it can't seem to shake its pince-nez image. Perhaps we've seen too many commercials with toffs in penguin suits to accept the fact that operagoers are, in fact, a motley middle-class lot. And the Wagner audience is the motliest of all -- emeritus professors sit side by side with ''Ring''-loving schoolteachers, fanatic record collectors, neophyte opera mavens and that woman wearing a Valkyrie helmet.
That is how Wagner wanted it. While he had a gift for extracting money from the wealthy, and became notoriously conservative in old age, he rejected the conventional picture of the opera house as a playground for socialites. After he fled Germany for Zurich in the wake of his participation in the 1849 Dresden uprising against the crown, he began to argue that the ''artwork of the future'' would no longer serve the moneyed classes but instead speak to the masses. He denounced the practice of favoring classics over new work. In a letter to the composer Franz Liszt, he heralded a time when ''we shall abandon our habit of clinging firmly to the past, our egotistical concern for permanence and immortality at any price.''
In his essay ''Art and Revolution,'' he proposed that theaters should be underwritten by the state and that all tickets should be free. In 1876, when he inaugurated a festival and opera house dedicated to staging his works in Bayreuth, Germany, he took pride in the democratic seating plan, which, unlike Madison Square Garden, gives everyone a good view.
The ''Ring'' itself carries a similar message. The adjective ''Wagnerian'' has entered popular discourse as a synonym for ''grandiose,'' but this colossal work is, in fact, a devastating deconstruction of the grand illusions of gods, men and dwarves. George Bernard Shaw, in his 1898 treatise ''The Perfect Wagnerite,'' influentially argued that the ''Ring'' is ''a drama of today,'' the power-seeking characters Wotan and Alberich suggesting the ruinous greed and corruption of a plutocratic society. Likewise, the musical language, with its system of identifying characters and concepts by leitmotifs, rejects operatic artifice in favor of direct communication. ''There is not a single bar of 'classical music' in the 'Ring,''' Shaw wrote.
The most potent moments are the most intimate, as when Wotan, chief of the gods, faces his own fallibility and, to quote Wagner's stage directions, sinks into ''the feeling of his powerlessness.'' The true test of the Met's production, directed by Robert Lepage, will come not in the Valhalla spectacle of ''Das Rheingold,'' but next spring, in that scene from ''Die Walkure.''
In 1891, Mark Twain, no fan of elite culture, visited Bayreuth. He sent home an essay that reads at first like a methodical takedown: he notes all the weirdness of the Wagner cult, the confounding aspects of the experience. ''Sometimes I feel like the sane person in a community of the mad,'' he writes. Then, just when he seems ready to give the knife a final twist, he reveals himself as another convert. ''But by no means do I ever overlook or minify the fact that this is one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life. I have never seen anything like this before. I have never seen anything so great and fine and real as this devotion.''
In the audience at the ''Ring'' on Monday night will be more than a few people undergoing the same stunned epiphany. On them, the money will be well spent.

HEADLINE: With Part of Stimulus Act Expiring, Thousands Face Losing New Jobs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs within weeks unless Congress extends one of the more effective job-creating programs in the $787 billion stimulus act: a $1 billion New Deal-style program that directly paid the salaries of unemployed people so they could get jobs in government, at nonprofit organizations and at many small businesses.
In rural Perry County, Tenn., the program helped pay for roughly 400 new jobs in the public and private sectors. But in a county of 7,600 people, those jobs had a big impact: they reduced Perry County's unemployment rate to less than 14 percent this August, from the Depression-like levels of more than 25 percent that it hit last year after its biggest employer, an auto parts factory, moved to Mexico. 
If the stimulus program ends on schedule next week, Perry County officials said, an estimated 300 people there will lose their jobs -- the equivalent of another factory closing.
''It's very scary, because there's just no work,'' said Brian Davis, a 36-year-old father of four, who got a stimulus-subsidized job with the City of Lobelville after he lost his job of 17 years at an auto parts plant that shed hundreds of jobs. Now he faces the prospect of unemployment again.
''This was a huge help,'' Mr. Davis said. ''The way the economy's been and the way people are struggling, you're worried about putting food on the table for your children and keeping the electricity on.''
The money that pays Mr. Davis's salary, and the salaries of tens of thousands of other people around the country, will dry up after next Thursday, when the welfare program in the stimulus act that pays the bills for those jobs is set to expire. While the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress want to extend the program, they are meeting stiff resistance from Republicans, many of whom oppose all things stimulus.
If the program has encountered hostility from Republicans on Capitol Hill, it has been embraced by some Republican governors who have used it to create jobs in their states.
In Mississippi, an innovative program used the money to pay private companies to hire nearly 3,200 workers, and to pay their salaries on a sliding scale so that the employers would end up paying the entire amount after six months.
Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, described the initiative there as ''welfare to work.'' Mr. Barbour, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said in an interview last winter that he hoped the program would be extended past this month, since it took so long for the state's program to get federal approval.
The federal program has helped employ nearly 130,000 adults and has paid for nearly an equal number of summer jobs for young people, according to an analysis by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal policy institute in Washington.
If the program is allowed to lapse, up to 26,000 workers in Illinois will lose their jobs in the coming weeks, along with 12,000 workers in Pennsylvania and thousands more in other states, according to LaDonna Pavetti, the director of the center's welfare reform and income support division.
''I think that given what we know about the number of people that have been impacted by the recession and the limited jobs available, this has been a lifeline for many families with kids who would otherwise not know when their next rent payment or meal would be coming in,'' Dr. Pavetti said.
The money came from a pot of $5 billion that was included in the stimulus package as an emergency fund for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the main cash welfare program for families with children. Of the $4.3 billion that has been approved so far, $1.4 billion has gone toward basic assistance, $1.8 billion has been used to help families pay one-time emergency expenses like rent and utility bills, and a little over $1 billion has been used to subsidize jobs.
Some economists consider subsidized jobs one of the most cost-effective ways to stimulate employment: there is no overhead or profit, as there is when firms win bids to perform work for the government.
Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat who championed the idea of creating jobs in hard-hit Perry County and other places with high unemployment, said he would like to see the program extended because it had a more direct impact than other components of the stimulus act, like infrastructure projects and tax cuts.
''I thought we were able to make very efficient use of these funds,'' he said in an interview on Friday, ''with the money not going off into the ether to create jobs on a spreadsheet, but going where you could go find people who had jobs today who did not have them before.''
There are success stories in Tennessee. After the Armstrong Pie Company hired 12 workers with stimulus money, it was able to expand its production, add delivery routes and increase sales, said Dalyn Patterson, who owns the company with her husband, Bert. The business increased enough that she said she expected to keep 11 of the 12 workers.
But if the program was supposed to act as a bridge to keep people working until the economy started adding jobs in large numbers again, officials in Tennessee said that it was ending a bit early. And many of the 300 workers who are set to lose their stimulus jobs in Perry County may not be able to collect unemployment benefits. So while people there are grateful for the program, they are nervous about what comes next.
''It was very much a Band-Aid,'' said Mayor Robby J. Moore of Lobelville, Tenn. ''And now the Band-Aid is coming off.''

HEADLINE: Credit Unions Expand Clientele

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
OVER the years, a number of home buyers have turned to credit unions as a less expensive alternative, often finding fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages with interest rates equal to or lower than those offered by mainstream banks.
For a while, borrowers had to be affiliated with a particular company, profession, religious congregation or union in order to join. But many of these not-for-profit cooperatives have been opening their doors to outsiders. 
''Most people don't know this, but if you're walking down the street, you'll probably be able to find within one to two miles a credit union you can join,'' said Bill Hampel, a senior vice president and the chief economist of the Credit Union National Association, a trade group based in Washington.
Sikorsky Financial Credit Union, for example, serves employees of the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Conn., the maker of Black Hawk helicopters. But all those who live, work, volunteer or worship in Fairfield, New Haven and Hartford Counties, and in the towns of New Milford and Bridgewater, in Litchfield County, are eligible to join.
Affinity Federal Credit Union, which is based in Basking Ridge, N.J., serves employees of the State of New Jersey, though anyone who joins one of a dozen local associations can be a member, even if they later give up their club membership. A few local businesses can also join.
But while many credit unions have become less exclusive, oftentimes they are not less restrictive. Mr. Hampel noted that the nation's 7,500 credit unions rarely offer subprime products to their 90 million members. Because of their not-for-profit status, ''they have no incentive to talk the member into some wild mortgage,'' he said.
Sikorsky's credit union, meanwhile, will not loan or refinance in excess of $500,000, below the value of most homes in affluent Fairfield County. Still, for 20 percent down, it offers a 30-year fixed rate of 4.5 percent, with no points. A five-year adjustable-rate mortgage with no points is 5.0 percent. Closing costs for each are about $1,150.
By contrast, Bank of America's rate for a 30-year fixed loan for customers in Fairfield County generally ranges from 4.125 to 5.875 percent, with up to 3.875 points, plus other fees, including an appraisal and credit check, that in total generally run into several thousand dollars.
''A lot of people, especially younger people, don't know what a credit union is,'' said Bob Boucher, a senior vice president for lending at Sikorsky's credit union.
Municipal Credit Union, which is based in New York, waives closing fees for first-time buyers, according to Sherry Goldman, a spokeswoman. (Eligible members include public-sector employees of New York's five boroughs and employees of public and private colleges in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.)
Credit unions have blossomed since the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in 2008. In 2007, they granted $60 billion in first-time loans, which include first mortgages and refinancings, according to the Credit Union National Association. Last year the total was $94 billion -- a 50 percent increase -- and so far in 2010 they have done $31 billion. Most business now comes from mortgage refinancings, said Bob Dorsa, the president of the American Credit Union Mortgage Association, another trade group. Refinancing volume is not tracked by the industry.
Sikorsky offers an 8- or 12-year refinancing loan, at 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent, for older buyers who want to pay off loans before retiring. Sikorsky charges a flat $350 application fee.
The largest 20 percent of the nation's credit unions hold 80 percent of the industry's nearly $885 billion in assets, according to the National Credit Union Administration, which charters and regulates federal credit unions.
They are ''just as sophisticated as a community bank,'' Mr. Hampel said, ''but not crazy like Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: Zurich, for a Song

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD. 
CHARLES ISHERWOOD is a theater critic for The New York Times.

 BODY:
MAYBE it's best to begin by confessing that I've never really seen the point of Switzerland. In a couple of dozen trips to Europe over the last 20 years and more, I somehow never set foot on Swiss soil.
Why the apathy? Well, I have yet to come into possession of a fortune needing to be squirreled away in a numbered bank account. I've always considered skiing an expensive way of acquiring a broken leg. Chocolate? I like See's. It comes from California. Watches? Who needs one when you have an iPhone?
Yet as the sun set over the Alps one summer evening -- technically I understand these were not Alps, just some verdant Swiss mountains, but they looked Alpine to me -- I found myself happily sipping bubbly wine on the terrace of the Zurich Opera House, midway through a sublime performance of ''La Traviata,'' and midway through a richly satisfying five-day stint in a city I never expected to visit. 
For some people, recreational travel is virtually a vocation, something to be planned and researched with dedication and thoroughness. Logistically complex vacations are mapped with military precision -- to Tuscany we shall go! -- as the list of dream destinations is winnowed. I envy these systematic voyagers, who can spend months researching the best-located new boutique hotel, the most underappreciated city for high-quality dining.
I am not such a person. Although I have always enjoyed traveling, I am a hopeless and even feckless planner of vacations. I tend to buy guidebooks in a desperate last-minute rush to the bookstore, and then fall asleep over them during the flight. I have found it more fruitful -- and certainly less stressful -- to piggyback on friends' organizational skills. Hence my unexpected but rewarding trip to Switzerland's largest city, nestled in the top corner of the country in the German-speaking area.
In a roundabout fashion, the opera star Renee Fleming brought me to Zurich. Not literally, of course. A good friend of Ms. Fleming's is a good friend of mine, and he would rather have contracted consumption than risk being absent when she sang what might prove to be her last Violetta. This necessitated a summer trip to Zurich, our five-day visit coinciding with two performances of ''Traviata'' in a busy week for the house.
Although it is by no means a global musical destination, in the summer Zurich hosts a wide-ranging arts and music festival -- the Zurcher Festspiele -- and it is possible to see a half-dozen operas alone in a single week. During the year, the pace continues. The bankers in Zurich clearly support the opera, for the company pays handsomely to attract world-class singers and conductors, despite the city's relatively modest status on the cultural radar. This fall alone brings a mouthwatering assortment of talents: the compelling German soprano Waltraud Meier and Peter Seiffert in a production of ''Tristan und Isolde'' conducted by Bernard Haitink; Juan Diego Florez hurling out those high C's as Nemorino in Donizetti's ''L'Elisir d'Amore''; Jose Cura as Cavaradossi in a ''Tosca'' from the gifted director Robert Carsen.
And the theater itself, which presides over a prime location in the center of the city, is a classic European jewel box, its interior a sudsy riot of cream and gold. The cozy intimacy is a distinct attraction too. At about 1,100 seats it makes the Metropolitan Opera feel like Yankee Stadium. Here singers can deploy their talents without having to scream forth their characters' dying breaths.
It may be prudent to have an ancillary motive of some kind in making a trip to Zurich. A pretext for your visit can be useful in distracting you from the single most scream-worthy fact about Switzerland: its fearsome expensiveness. The presence of so many millionaires and tax dodgers does, after all, tend to keep prices in the stratospheric range. But whether it's opera, skiing or spa-going -- all pricey enterprises, to be sure -- if you cannot avoid emptying the coffers for your particular passion, you can economize in other ways. My chief advice for all moderately budgeted travelers spending some time exploring the charms of this small, clean, comfortable and easygoing city: Don't buy stuff.
Since I am by no means a serial shopper at home, I usually let my credit cards do a little frolicking on the few occasions when I'm abroad. The confusions of currency conversion are a famous balm to the anxiety of spending, but in Switzerland I found myself abashed at the prices of my usual indulgences -- mostly clothes -- and further confounded by the relative ease of translating the Swiss franc into greenbacks: The exchange rate was essentially one to one. (A more sensible traveler would have known about this in advance. As Switzerland is not on the euro, that currency's summer-long slide against the dollar did me no favors.)
But the decision to acquire nothing on your travels can be liberating, allowing you to tear whole sections out of the metaphorical (or literal) guidebook. And avoiding the temptation to go hog wild is easier than even the reflexively acquisitive might think in Zurich. The Bahnhofstrasse, the main shopping drag that wends down the river leading away from the main train station, is hailed in some guidebooks as one of the loveliest and most appealing shopping districts in Europe. It's perfectly pleasant, but fundamentally generic -- a string of familiar brand-name boutiques (Prada, Dior and the rest) interrupted by the facades of private banks you've never heard of.
Although a visit to the city's premiere chocolate and sweet palace on the Bahnhofstrasse, Sprungli, is heartily advised, after making some perishable purchases there your credit card bills will be less likely to torment you if you leave the rest of the street's consumption palaces alone. Walk a few blocks, then weave away toward the river, which is a natural draw with its bright clarity, handsome quays and bathing pavilions.
If shop you must, then head out to the Zurich West neighborhood, sort of the Williamsburg of the city, which is poised between industrial use and hip urban renovation. The new Viadukt development tucks a dozen or so eclectic shops under the arches of elevated train tracks. On the way from the Hardbrucke train station, you'll pass by the arresting Freitag store, where they sell stylish bags made from used materials (at non-used prices, to be sure). In keeping with the repurposing ethos, the store itself is made up of a towering stack of used shipping containers.
Here, wandering amid the oddly assorted boutiques -- surf wear, gorgeously wrought gewgaws from Africa, a discount outlet selling store display materials from the Company clothing chain -- while still keeping the MasterCard tightly shackled, I came upon the kind of serendipitous discovery that rewards those who share my haphazard approach to planning. In a dusty corner of this dusty neighborhood poised between decay and fabulousness I discovered a funky public badminton center.
Badminton -- my lost love!
I haven't played with any regularity -- maybe even at all -- since I was on the high school team, and I insisted on peeking inside. The Yonex Badminton Halle is essentially the badminton equivalent of the hipster bowling alleys that have proliferated in American cities in recent years, with the grungy bar and the sullen bartender, the tongue-in-cheek bad art on the walls, the throbbing indie rock howling from the sound system.
But instead of lanes: three immaculately kept badminton courts. Bring on the shuttlecocks, please. The museums can wait, and we don't have to be back at the opera house for three hours.
This funky western frontier should be approached by train -- Zurich West is one stop from the central Bahnhof -- but as with most European cities, Zurich is best explored on foot. (Another dollar-saving tip: take the train to and from the airport. It's cheap, easy and, unlike similar jaunts in other cities, involves minimal heaving of luggage.)
Sturdy and drearily sensible shoes are not really necessary, either. Most of the notable sights and pleasurable diversions are nestled fairly close together. The center of the city is pocket-size, with the promenades along the river and the Old Town that clusters around them making a natural focus for as much leisurely strolling as you care to indulge in.
You can eat reasonably if you aren't looking for formal meals, too. Sausage central is the Vorderer Sternen Grill on the central Bellevueplatz, where everybody goes for a bratwurst and most eat standing up. And my friend and I found ourselves returning to the snazzy food hall at the Globus department store. I love browsing the European department stores that haven't yet colonized America, and on the first floor of the Globus on the Bellevueplatz you can grab a salad or pad Thai, pizza and wine, cappuccino and ice cream, and feel like a real local as you elbow your way to a seat amid the neatly dressed workers on their lunch breaks.
Zurich is, rather appealingly, not awash in the kind of must-see tourist attractions that can make a week in some European cities more exhausting than exhilarating. If the weather's dreary why not allow yourself an idle afternoon watching oddities on television, as I did. (Wimbledon was heading toward its climax, and clicking around I discovered a talk show with the raccoon-eyed '80s punk rocker Nina Hagen making an appearance -- who knew she was still around?)
But modern art and ancient faith have made for a pair of intriguing partnerships. Art in general has a significant presence here -- where there's money, there are galleries -- and a fruitful day can be spent exploring the lively contemporary art scene. (A current lineup of shows can be found at artinswitzerland.com.) But the newest addition to the city's public artworks should be put at the top of the list of art-centric destinations: the stained-glass windows in the Grossmunster church by Sigmar Polke, the German painter who died this year.
Recently unveiled, the windows have strikingly individual character. The most purely decorative -- and rapturously beautiful -- are those created from kaleidoscopic arrangements of thinly sliced agate stones in vivid combinations of color. They look like clusters of neon-colored cells caught under a microscope.
Five other windows are devoted to particular themes or events from the Bible. Particularly riveting is the black-and-white composition considering the concept of ''the son of man'' -- an ambiguous biblical phrase sometimes referring to Christ and sometimes to humanity itself. This duality of meanings is reflected in the optical illusion rendered by Mr. Polke in the glass. If you focus on the light coming through the white glass you see a stack of delicately carved chalices; if you see instead the black shapes carving the light, you see human faces in profile.
Mr. Polke's windows almost seem intended to converse with, or make a sort of companion piece to, both the more traditional stained-glass windows in the Grossmunster choir by Augusto Giacometti (the uncle of the more famous Alberto) and the famous windows by Marc Chagall in the Fraumunster church on the opposite bank of the river. These windows, created in 1970, are spectacular in size and in the richness of coloration. You can easily visit both churches in the same afternoon and compare the folk-inflected whimsy of Chagall with Mr. Polke's more eclectic approach to biblical storytelling.
The other major art destinations in Zurich are also revered institutions, of diverging kinds. First, the Kunsthaus, just over a small hill from the right-bank section of the Old Town, is a world-class art museum of unusual serenity. Because Zurich does not draw outlandish numbers of tourists, this beautifully laid out museum, with a luxurious collection of 19th-century and early 20th-century European work, makes for a refreshing change from the epic throngs teeming through the galleries in most European capitals.
And while you can cut back on your expenses, if not your waistline, by eating from street carts and food courts, the Kronenhalle restaurant serves excellent steaks and traditional local fare at prices that are by no means outlandish for Zurich, where it is easy to find a $50 risotto. The $60 or $70 you may spend on that steak isn't particularly egregious by the standards of consumption in New York City's cow palaces, for that matter.
At Peter Luger, however, you don't have the excitement of a Kandinsky or a Picasso at your elbow as you saw into your beef. The restaurant's founder was a champion of modern art and amassed a collection that still decorates the rooms and is comparable to that of a small museum. A little discretion is necessary if you want to really ogle all the artwork; you don't want to drag your tie in somebody's vichyssoise to get a closer look at that Chagall.
THE Limmat River, which bisects the city, becomes a natural focus of your attention in any visit to Zurich. You will traverse it by bridge many times, in search of the next church or meal, and when the weather is nice, you'll probably want to get on or into that gleaming stream. There are various ways of accommodating this, mainly from the bottom of the Bahnhofstrasse: Large, covered boats with glass windows, flat enough to squeeze under bridges, tote passengers up and down the river, while boats that leave from the Burkliplatz will take you on longer excursions around Lake Zurich. Better yet, you can rent a small boat for a private tour, and make a more leisurely perusal of the millionaires' manses lining the lake. Just make sure you bring along somebody who can point out Tina Turner's pile on the right bank, discreetly set back from the water's edge.
If you don't want to stop at skimming across the sparkling waters, stroll down the quays along the right bank to Tiefenbrunnen, where there's an appealing beach. It's a half-hour walk, but in fine weather it's among the most pleasant in Zurich. Tiefenbrunnen is also home to another splurge-worthy restaurant, Blaue Ente, a sleek modern place with Euro-melange cuisine -- an excellent veal chop, a tasty Arctic char preparation -- drawn from mostly local ingredients.
Perhaps the best climax for a short, budget-minded jaunt to Zurich would be a trip up a nearby peak, Uetliberg. A train heading up the mountain leaves from the main train, and the ride is a mere 15 minutes or so. Once there you can make the short hike up to the top, and spend an hour at the hotel restaurant admiring the views. There's an observation platform at the top that provides 360-degree vistas of Zurich and the surrounding countryside, the dense Black Forest just visible in the distance. For more ambitious athletes there are expansive hiking trails along the ridge. The times and distances of the various hikes are helpfully listed on placards with maps.
But in keeping with my laid-back approach to seeing the city, which beckoned more by circumstance than by compulsion, my friend and I opted to take it easy. Instead of strapping on boots and backpacks and hitting the trails, we tucked into a cheese plate.
This turned out to be yet another unexpected splurge, since even the price of cheese can inspire gloomy thoughts about the trembling global economy and the peculiar imperviousness of the Swiss franc to the recent turbulence. But the crisp air and the luxuriant views of the countryside help concentrate the mind on things immaterial. By way of heightening this sense of removal from quotidian matters, we added a bottle of wine to the order. After all, when you're up above the world, with a breathtaking God's-eye view of what seems like half of Switzerland, it's impossible to see price tags.
IF YOU GO
A recent online search found nonstop flights from New York to Zurich in October starting at $650.
LODGING
Even local residents praise the Romantikhotel Florhof (Florhofgasse 4; 41-44-250-26-26; florhof.ch) as the most charming small hotel in Zurich. It is tucked away just outside the city center on a quiet street near the Kunsthaus. Single rooms start at around 265 Swiss francs -- just a bit more in dollars -- and doubles begin at 360 Swiss francs.
For a truly central location, the Hotel Opera (Dufourstrasse 5; 41-44-258-99-99; www.operahotel.ch) is a good bet. It's just steps away from the Zurich Opera House, naturally enough, but is nicely appointed and has spacious rooms. Singles are around 200 Swiss francs; doubles start at 300.
DINING
Everyone goes to the Kronenhalle (Ramistrasse 4; 41-44-262-99-00; kronenhalle.com), a Zurich mainstay with excellent steaks at heady prices, and possibly the best modern art collection of any restaurant in the world. Reservations recommended.
Blaue Ente (Seefeldstrasse 223; 41-44-388-68-40; blau-ente.ch) is a sleek, modern restaurant with forward-looking Mediterranean food and a stylish atmosphere.
For a wonderful wurst, the indispensable stop is the Vorderer Sternen Grill (Theaterstrasse 22; 41-44-251 49-49; vorderer-sternen.ch), the informal sausage house next to its tonier brother restaurant.
MISCELLANY
For some authentic Swiss purchases, check out the toweringFreitagstore in the western part of the city for cool messenger bags (Geroldstrasse 17; 41-43-366-95-20; freitag.ch) or, for elegant women's wear, the pre-eminent local label Akris (Bahnhofstrasse 30 and several other locations; akris.ch).
For recreation, don't forget the Yonex Badminton Halle, also in the western section (Geroldstrasse 5; 41-44-273-11- 22; www.badmintonhalle.ch). Price: 36 Swiss francs for 45 minutes. A bit steep, but there's also a bar on the premises.
Correction: October 24, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover story on Sept. 26 about an opera-lover's visit to Zurich referred incorrectly to the location of the city's opera house. It is a few blocks from the mouth of the Limmat River by Lake Zurich, into which the river flows; it is not alongside the river.

HEADLINE: Not Just A Perch For King Kong

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE new exhibition at the Keith de Lellis Gallery, ''New York: A Bird's-Eye View,'' has a striking assortment of aerial views of the city. No image is more arresting than that of the Navy dirigible Los Angeles docking at the mooring post of the Empire State Building, a giant cigarlike cylinder coming nose-to-nose with the tallest building in the world.
That the photograph is a composite, a fake, is disappointing but not surprising: no airship ever docked there, and indeed the whole mooring mast concept was a bit of a stunt itself. 
In late 1929, Alfred E. Smith, the leader of a group of investors erecting the Empire State Building, announced that they were increasing the height of the building to 1,250 feet from 1,050. Mr. Smith, a past governor of New York, denied that competition with the 1,046-foot-high Chrysler Building was a factor. ''We are measuring its rise by principles of economic investment rather than spectacular standards,'' he told The New York Times.
The extra 200 feet, it was announced, was to serve as a mooring mast for dirigibles so that they could dock in Midtown, rather than out in Lakehurst, N.J., the station used by the German Graf Zeppelin. Mr. Smith said that at the Empire State Building, airships like the Graf, almost 800 feet long, would ''swing in the breeze and the passengers go down a gangplank''; seven minutes later they would be on the street.
But the Germans, who dominated dirigible technology, had not asked for a docking station, and passenger traffic on dirigibles was still minuscule. The mast camouflaged the quest for boasting rights to the world's tallest building, an ambition to which it seemed indecent to admit.
Dr. Hugo Eckener, the commander of the Graf Zeppelin and the world's expert on dirigibles, said flatly that the Empire State project was not practical. Zeppelin landings required scores of ground crewmen, retaining ropes fore and aft, and even then landings were sometimes dicey. Dr. Eckener had trained the dirigible crews for the bombing raids over London in World War I.
The dirigible docking project was still up in the air in March 1931, when Dr. Eckener visited the tower, after which all he had to say was that the matter required further study. The Skyscraper Museum has photographs of the construction of the Empire State Building online.
The tallest building in the world opened that May; the developers acknowledged that the apparatus for winching the airships had not yet been designed. In December the Navy airship J-4 flew from Lakehurst and hovered around the tower at the request of a newsreel company. The 30-mile-an-hour winds, described as ''treacherous'' by The Times, made the approach difficult.
In mid-September another dirigible was able to jury-rig a three-minute connection to the top of the building, in 40-mile-an-hour winds. Two weeks later the Goodyear Blimp Columbia picked up a stack of Evening Journals from the newspaper's plant at 210 South Street and lowered them on a 100-foot-line to a man on the tower, who was able to cut the bundle free.
The Columbia tried to connect again the next day, but could not. That was the last recorded attempt to make contact of any sort; in the same year NBC began broadcasting from the tower.
In 1936 Dr. Eckener passed over the Empire State Building at night on his way to Lakehurst. In command of the new dirigible Hindenburg, he resisted Nazi efforts to take over the airship program, and by May of the following year had been replaced. That was when the Hindenburg burned and crashed in Lakehurst, effectively ending commercial passenger travel in airships.
Donald Friedman, a structural engineer who contributed an essay to the 1998 book ''Building the Empire State,'' edited by Carol Willis, said that strictly from a structural standpoint the notion of securing an airship to the Empire State Building, even at the very top, was a reasonable one. John Tauranac, the author of the 1995 ''The Empire State Building,'' agrees.
But the notion that passengers would be able to descend an airport-style ramp from a moving airship to the tip of the tallest building in the world, even in excellent conditions, beggars belief.
The original docking level is one floor above the 102nd-floor observatory, up some steep stairs behind an unmarked door. The stairs lead to a circular room perhaps 25 feet across. A door leads out to the circular terrace where passengers fresh from Europe or South America -- and their steamer trunks -- were to have set foot on American ground.
The terrace is perhaps two and a half feet wide, and the parapet could not be any higher than that; it's like standing on the raised lip of a Campbell's soup can, a quarter-mile up. And because the terrace is circular, each side disappearing left and right, there is an uncomfortable sensation of being pushed outward. Were I arriving from Germany, I would have opted for blinders before leaving the nose. But it is an intoxicating view.
The show at the de Lellis Gallery, 1045 Madison Avenue at 79th Street, continues through Nov. 20, with about two dozen images of New York, ranging from amateur rooftop views from the 1880s to spectacular high-altitude views of the 1940s. It appears that the photomontage of the dirigible Los Angeles hitched to the Empire State Building was a backup, in case an actual picture could not be taken -- the Los Angeles did pass over the building in November 1931, but it was at 10 p.m.

HEADLINE: I Logo New York

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
As part of the bargain that kept JetBlue Airways from moving its headquarters from Queens to Orlando, state tourism officials agreed to let the airline mesh the iconic I NY logo with its own. 
The result, above, which was unveiled on Monday, signifies the first time that a corporation has received permission to link its brand to the symbol that is widely recognized as one of the most valuable assets in the realm of tourism marketing.
Now that the barrier has been broken, what other companies or products do you think would be suitable candidates to entwine themselves with I NY? Hot dogs from Sabrett, Gray's Papaya or Nathan's? Murray's Bagels? Magnolia Bakery? The Shake Shack? Saks Fifth Avenue, Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman? Time Warner Cable? Housing Works Thrift Shops?
Use your imagination to design a logo or slogan for a New York brand or company that integrates I NY, and submit your creations, which should not exceed five megabytes, using this simple upload form. We have published an initial gallery of your submissions here, and will be updating it throughout the week.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours: Chicago

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
ALL cities have their ups and downs, but Chicago has been on the rise by playing to its strengths, adding parks, architectural crowd pleasers and public art. Much of this has happened on the watch of Mayor Richard M. Daley, who, after 21 years in office, announced this month that he would be stepping down. How will the city fare without him? Just fine, probably, thanks to the raft of improvements that has left Chicago fortified both by 19th- and 20th-century public spaces brimming with 21st-century attractions.
Friday
4 p.m. 
1) LOOP THE LOOP
Chicago is a city of architecture tours, but one of the best is right above you: the ''L,'' the elevated subway that circles the Loop (transitchicago.com). Get on the brown, orange or pink lines -- it doesn't matter which color, as long as you sit in the first car by the front-view window -- and round the two-square-mile area. If you're going clockwise, look to the left. Among landmarks you'll see are Bertrand Goldberg's spectacular Marina City, the new Trump International Hotel and Tower, Frank Gehry's Pritzker Pavilion band shell and Louis Sullivan's historic Auditorium Building. Miss one? No problems. The $2.25 ticket buys unlimited loops.
8 p.m. 2)MIDWAY FARE
Credit the recession, but a number of good midprice but high-style restaurants have opened in Chicago in the last two years. A favorite is Gilt Bar (230 West Kinzie Street; 312-464-9544; giltbarchicago.com), a casual restaurant in the River North neighborhood that isn't casual about its cooking. The menu features New American dishes like blackened cauliflower with capers ($7) and ricotta gnocchi with sage and brown butter ($13). After dinner, head downstairs to Curio, a basement bar with a Prohibition theme. Try the Death's Door Daisy, made with artisanal Wisconsin vodka and Aperol, a blood orange liqueur, for $10.
11 p.m. 3)COME ON IN
There are so many clubs on Ontario Street, just north of the loop, that it's sometimes known as Red Bull Row. For a mellower jolt, head to the Uptown neighborhood, to Big Chicks (5024 North Sheridan Road; 773-728-5511; bigchicks.com) a gay bar that welcomes everyone. The drinks are cheap, the crowd is friendly and the decor is appealingly kooky.
Saturday
9 a.m. 4)FANCY EGGS
Couldn't get to dinner at Frontera Grill, the nouvelle Mexican restaurant owned by the celebrity chef Rick Bayless? No worries. Just head over for breakfast at Xoco (449 North Clark Street; 312-661-1434; rickbayless.com), Mr. Bayless's newest restaurant. It's served till 10 a.m.; expect a line after 8:30. Favorites include scrambled egg empanada with poblano chili ($3), and an open-face torta with soft poached egg, salsa, cheese, cilantro and black beans ($4). Chocolate cafe au lait ($3.25) comes with a single hot, crisp, sugary churro.
11 a.m. 5)OFF-LABEL STRIP
The Magnificent Mile area is filled with flagships (Gucci, Vuitton -- you know the list). But there are still some independent stores you won't find at your hometown mall. Ikram (873 North Rush Street; 312-587-1000; ikram.com) is the stylish boutique that counts Michelle Obama among its customers, with fashion-forward labels like Jason Wu and Martin Margiela. East Oak Street has a couple of cool shops, including Sofia (No. 72; 312-640-0878; sofiavintage.com). Next door is Colletti Gallery (No. 102; 312-664-6767; collettigallery.com), with a gorgeous selection of Art Deco and Art Nouveau furniture and objets. It's a short walk from there to the Museum of Contemporary Art (220 East Chicago Avenue; 312-280-2660; mcachicago.org), which has a spectacular exhibition of works by Alexander Calder -- and works inspired by Calder -- through Oct. 17.
2 p.m. 6)FIRST NEIGHBORHOOD
Walking around Hyde Park, a leafy enclave about seven miles south of the Loop, it's easy to see why the Obamas settled there. Their house, on South Greenwood Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is nearly invisible behind Secret Service barricades. Luckily, the nearby Robie House (5757 South Woodlawn Avenue; 800-514-3849; gowright.org), a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece, is open for tours. See if you can find an abstracted male figure in the Japanese-inspired leaded-glass windows. Across the street, the beautifully landscaped University of Chicago campus is worth exploring for an afternoon.
7 p.m. 7) LIVESTOCK MENU
Chicago was once the meatpacking capital of the world, and it still knows what to do with offal. Take Girl & the Goat (809 West Randolph Streeet, 312-492-6262; girlandthegoat.com), a much-blogged-about new restaurant where the ''Top Chef'' winner Stephanie Izard takes livestock parts seriously. The often-updated menu recently included lamb ribs with grilled avocado and pistachio piccata ($17), and braised beef tongue with masa and beef vinaigrette ($12). If you're not a carnivore, try chickpeas three ways ($11), and for dessert, potato fritters with lemon poached eggplant and Greek yogurt ($8). The soaring dining room, designed by the Chicago design firm 555 International, is warm and modern, with exposed beams, walls of charred cedar and a large open kitchen. Reservations essential.
10 p.m. 8) FUNNY BONE
The Red Bar Comedy Show offers performances on Fridays and Saturdays at 8 and 10 p.m. You won't find big names, but a hit-or-miss roster of itinerant comedians, some who heckle the audience in language that can't be printed here. Tickets, $10 include admission to the upstairs lounge, where bottle-service vodkas start at $200. More information is available at (773)387-8412 and redbarcomedy.com.
Sunday
10 a.m. 9)BEAUTIFICATION BRUNCH
Logan Square, about five to six miles northwest of the Loop, is a remnant of Chicago's late-19th-century beautification movement, with a statue of an eagle by Evelyn Longman where two of the grandest boulevards meet. Nearby, Longman & Eagle (2657 North Kedzie Avenue; 773-276-7110; longmanandeagle.com) is a rough-edged bar that serves a refined brunch: a chunky sockeye salmon tartare with pickled mango ($10) or a wild boar ''Sloppy Joe'' ($10). Six hotel rooms are set to open upstairs.
1 p.m. 10)GRAND PIANO
Chicago knows how to mix neo-classical architecture with contemporary design, and no place does it better than the Art Institute of Chicago (111 South Michigan Avenue; 312-443-3600; artinstituteofchicago.org), which opened its celebrated Modern Wing last year. Designed by Renzo Piano, it the luminous addition contains a magnificent set of galleries for 1900-1950 European art (Picasso, Giacometti, Klee are a few of the big names) and a capacious room for the museum's design collection. Hungry or not, check out Terzo Piano, the stunning rooftop restaurant with views of the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park across the street.
3 p.m. 11) WHEELS UP
From the museum, walk over the pedestrian bridge, also designed by Mr. Piano, to Millennium Park, and rent bikes from Bike and Roll (312-729-1000; bikechicago.com), about $35 a day, for a ride up the shore of Lake Michigan. You'll pass Navy Pier, skyscrapers by Mies van der Rohe, and hundreds of beach volleyball courts, which make this the Malibu of the Midwest on summer and fall weekends. Along the way, you'll pass Lincoln Park, with a new pavilion by the Chicago architect Jeanne Gang -- another example of how the city is updating its open spaces.
IF YOU GO
Numerous airlines, including Delta, American and United, fly nonstop into Chicago from all three New York-area airports. Based on recent Web search, round-trip flights start at about $219 for travel in October.
The Allegro (171 West Randolph Street, 312-236-0123; allegrochicago.com), a 483-room hotel in the city's bustling theater district, in the bold style of Kimpton hotels. Rooms from about $149.
Opened last year, the Elysian (11 East Walton Street; 312-646-1300; elysianhotels.com) is a cushy 188-room hotel where the beds aren't made -- they're ''draped'' in 460-thread-count Rivolta Carmignani linens. From the outside, the building, not far from the Magnificent Mile, resembles a chateau. Rooms start at about $430.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The 36 Hours column last Sunday, about Chicago, contained several errors.The well-known shopping district along Michigan Avenue is the Magnificent Mile, not the Miracle Mile.The distance from the Loop to Logan Square is five to six miles, not two, and the distance to the popular Hyde Park neighborhood is about seven miles, not four. The academic calendar of the University of Chicago operates on a quarterly -- not semester -- system. And the Red Bar Comedy Show -- not Ontourage nightclub -- offers performances on Fridays and Saturdays at 8 and 10 p.m. -- not just on Saturdays at 10. (Red Bar is part of the Ontourage nightclub complex.) More information is available at (773)387-8412 and redbarcomedy.com.

HEADLINE: Three Faces of the New China

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- In a blur of headlines over the past few days, Americans have been surprised with brief, seemingly contradictory glimpses of how China is wielding its newfound power.
There was China the neighborhood bully, cutting off Japan's access to rare-earth minerals unless Tokyo folded in a minor, but longstanding, territorial dispute. (The Japanese folded.)
There was China the schmoozer, with its prime minister, Wen Jiabao, trying his hardest on Thursday to deflect President Obama's pressure over the value of China's currency -- really a battle over whether jobs go to workers in Seattle or Shenzhen. The two leaders talked for two hours at the United Nations. The outcome was left unclear.
And there was China the classic realist, opting for convenient inconsistency on sanctions against North Korea and Iran in efforts to balance its competing national interests. (The first is to engage the West on the Security Council. The others include securing oil and protecting a client-state from collapse.) 
In one sense, there's nothing surprising about a rising power finding subtle ways to handle complex problems. But before China's breakout from poverty to arguably the world's No. 2 economy, its default position on foreign policy was to restate the principle of non-interference in other nations' affairs and focus largely on its neighborhood.
That was before it had the military resources and the incentive to start thinking of how to secure and defend interests around the globe. Today, its interests include access to oil in places like Sudan and Iran, safe shipping around the Horn of Africa, the ability to manipulate its currency for its own gain.
And for the first time, the world is seeing a distinct range of behaviors, from aggressive to passive-aggressive to diplomatic, in places that 20 years ago China's leaders rarely thought about.
What American diplomats and analysts now have to figure out is what drives China's actions and responses, how to try to shape them and, some would argue, what limits to try to set.
''The China that President Obama hoped he was getting a year ago, the one that becomes this great cooperative global power on the biggest issues of the day -- that's not the China he's dealing with today,'' said David Shambaugh, director of the China policy program at George Washington University.
A senior administration official who often deals with the Chinese leadership said: ''As they begin to manage their many constituencies, their politics is looking more like ours.''
Here's a scouting report so far on China's style of muscle-flexing:
THE NEIGHBORHOOD: TIME FOR THE BIG STICK
For decades countries around Asia have been wary of China's resurgence -- tracking how many ships and missiles it was acquiring, and how it was using its influence as an investor. A decade ago, as President Bush took power, a number of neoconservatives urged him to ''contain'' China's presumed ambitions.
But containment would have probably been impossible and it proved, at least in the past decade, unnecessary. So far Beijing has not pressed new territorial claims; it has simply begun to defend old ones in sparsely inhabited places.
The Japanese stepped into one of those when they arrested the captain of a Chinese trawler near a group of islands in the East China Sea, called the Senkaku by the Japanese and the Diaoyu by China. The Japanese said the trawler rammed a Japanese coast guard vessel. A few years ago this might have been sorted out quietly as a consular issue. Not this time.
The Chinese -- perhaps driven by the People's Liberation Army, perhaps eager to begin to declare their equivalent of the Monroe Doctrine -- demanded the captain's return. Japan refused. Pushed by a nationalistic groundswell, China started blocking shipments of the rare earths, an act that threatened Japan's electronics industry.
''This played to the Asia First crowd in China,'' said Mr. Shambaugh, referring to a faction in China's establishment that says the wise course is to dominate the region while avoiding tussles with great powers. In recent months there have been disputes over American exercises in nearby waters and over the border with India.
''We've begun pushing back,'' said a senior administration official, explaining why the United States is sending an aircraft carrier to the area.
But the Japanese, after 20 years of recession, had no push left in them. The prosecutor dropped charges on Friday.
WASHINGTON: THE ART OF DEFLECTION
If China's strategy with Asia is all sharp elbows, with the United States it is largely politeness and deflection -- most of the time.
When Mr. Obama first encountered Hu Jintao, the country's president, a fire was threatening to consume both their economies, and they pursued the common strategy of massive stimulus. For most of 2009, one of Mr. Obama's top aides noted, ''everything else was set aside.''
Then they narrowly skirted clashes on environmental policy at Copenhagen, and a cyber attack on Google was traced to China. But it is China's foot-dragging on its promise to gradually let the market determine the value of its currency that has really strained relations. In Congress, rightly or wrongly, China is often accused of manipulating its currency to keep its factories humming, at the expense of American workers. Democrats and Republicans are calling for tariffs.
So far China's strategy appears to be to maintain the trappings of routine diplomacy while dragging its feet. Prime Minister Wen used the word ''cooperation'' or ''cooperative'' six times in just a few minutes when standing beside Mr. Obama here. But when the doors closed, America pressed for immediate action, and, a witness said, Mr. Wen ''dodged and weaved,'' restating arguments that it takes generations to build an economic powerhouse.
Jeffrey Bader, the National Security Council's Asia director, said the president noted he was ''disappointed that there had not been much movement'' since they last met. But his leverage was scant, which is why the White House threatened to to take other steps. Now the Chinese are gauging what he meant.
SPECIAL CASES: NORTH KOREA AND IRAN
North Korea and Iran are where China's local imperatives and great-power interests collide.
If America's No. 1 goal is a stripping North Korea of its nuclear weapons, China's is keeping North Korea stable. Should it collapse, the Chinese suspect, South Korea (and its American allies) will move in, perhaps up to China's border. As one American intelligence official put it recently, ''if the choice is between living with a half-crazed nuclear North or with us on top of them, the Chinese are choosing the first option.''
That doesn't mean they are happy about it. James Church, pen name of the author of ''The Man With the Baltic Stare,'' his latest spy novel about North Korea, learned about the country as an intelligence officer. He said in an interview: ''The Chinese may not like the North Koreans much. But there is too much geography, history and emotion tying them together and shaping Chinese thinking'' for Beijing to jettison its long-time client, particularly if it means North Korea's absorption by America's ally, the South.
So in 2009, after the North's second nuclear test, it suited China's interests to join sanctions against Pyongyang. This year, when the United States again tried sanctions over the North's presumed role in sinking a South Korean warship, the situation had changed: Kim Jong Il, the North's dictator, was ill, and China needed to gain influence over his son and presumed heir, Kim Jong Un, to keep the lid on the North. So the Chinese watered down the sanctions effort here, and, foreign diplomats said, held a small victory party with the North Korean delegation.
Iran is another special case. Twelve percent of China's oil comes from the country; while it has gone along with sanctions, it has also made sure that energy imports and exports were kept off the United Nations list. There is constant talk of new, long-term energy investments by the Chinese in Iran. But so far, few of those deals have been consummated. And when American officials point out that a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear ambitions would disrupt the flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf, the Chinese say they are certain it won't come to that.
It is the ultimate three-dimensional chess board, played Chinese style.

HEADLINE: The Great Connecticut- Country-Club Crackup

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai is a national political columnist for The Times and a regular contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
You could spend your life around political campaigns and never see a celebration quite like the one Linda McMahon held last month after Connecticut Republicans made her their Senate candidate in a three-way primary. McMahon is the fabulously wealthy founder (along with her high-school sweetheart and husband, Vince) of World Wrestling Entertainment, a company the McMahons transformed into a sort of Disney for the age of postindustrial American anger. Unknown to Connecticut voters before she began her run, she spent more than $20 million of her own fortune to beat out two Republican candidates -- one of them recruited by the national party -- for the right to square off this November against Richard Blumenthal, the state's longtime Democratic attorney general, in a contest to succeed Christopher Dodd, who is retiring. 
The first thing I noticed when I wandered into McMahon's victory party, at a Crowne Plaza Hotel south of Hartford, was the lavish spread -- not the usual weenies and plastic cups, but warm pasta and flaky pastries and drinks from an open bar, all of it consumed by supporters carting free ''Linda'' tote bags and T-shirts. The second thing was the vintage 1980s soundtrack, which included decidedly unpolitical tracks like the AC/DC classic ''You Shook Me All Night Long.'' She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies, knocking me out with those American thighs. . . .
Onstage, a tableau of supporters carefully constructed for television in the way of modern campaigns -- nonwhite faces up front, directly behind the candidate -- stood assembled under a banner that read, blandly, ''It's Time for Something Different.'' Just behind the lectern, alongside other family members, loomed McMahon's ponytailed, R.V.-size son-in-law, the wrestler known as Triple H. Then a state senator, Len Fasano, delivered one of the more bizarre political orations I had ever heard, getting himself so worked up that he apparently forgot which state he served and introduced the crowd to ''the next U.S. senator from the great state of New York!''
The 61-year-old candidate herself walked onstage in a pink suit and pearls, looking for all the world like the president of the Fairfield P.T.A., and proceeded to deliver a victory speech that was sort of amazing for its amalgamation of cliches and a complete, almost defiant, lack of substance.
''I had a great fear that the American dream was in the greatest jeopardy that it has ever been in our lifetime, and I didn't want to lose that opportunity for the American dream for our children and our grandchildren.''
''The great communicator Ronald Reagan had it right, but this president and this Congress have it wrong!''
''This campaign has never been about the political pundits or the establishment. This campaign is about you!''
And so on. Then McMahon strode off the stage to Survivor's ''Eye of the Tiger.''
Such a spectacle might not seem out of place in a state like California, where millionaires and celebrities are always jumping into the fray, or in one like Minnesota, where popular revolt seems to come in waves. But this is Connecticut, my home state, where the business of campaigns and governance used to be a predictable, serious affair, the province of mostly estimable public servants who worked their way up through town councils or local party machines. Sometimes called the Land of Steady Habits, Connecticut was never a place for garish campaigns and outsize characters with bank statements to match.
Until recently, the closest thing Connecticut experienced to an overturning of the political order, at least in modern times, was the revolt over a state income tax in the early 1990s. So incensed were the voters then that they replaced their moderate governor, the former longtime senator Lowell Weicker, with a more conservative career politician, a three-term congressman named John Rowland. Take that, status quo!
That, however, was before Rowland and a small cadre of other Connecticut officeholders were hauled away to prison on corruption charges; before Democrats ousted Joe Lieberman from the party only six years after they nominated him for the vice presidency; before the politicians in Hartford blew a hole the size of Long Island Sound in the state budget. As I watched McMahon's hopeful supporters file out of the ballroom clutching their tote bags, I found myself wondering: when, exactly, did genteel Connecticut become Louisiana? And if politics could get this weird here, then what did that mean for the rest of the country?
As in much of the Northeast, Connecticut politics for most of the last century was the purview of two distinct cultural camps: the urban, ethnic machines that dominated the Democratic Party and the patrician Republicans (the Bushes of Greenwich, most notably) who considered it their duty to serve. In postwar suburbs like Trumbull, where my parents moved from Bridgeport and raised their three children, the two groups coexisted uneasily but, for the most part, productively and congenially. Democrats and Republicans might have argued over where to build a new school or whether to let the highway plow through a park, but rarely was there anything personal about it.
Things started to change in the 1980s, for reasons both cultural and economic. A new generation of politicians ascended to power -- liberals and conservatives with sharply moralistic approaches to politics. At the same time, the manufacturing decline that was beginning to erode the nation's economic base, along with the ''white flight'' that began in the 1960s, hollowed out Connecticut's cities and weakened its governing establishment. Outsiders tend to think of Connecticut as a collection of wealthy suburbs and rural horse farms, as portrayed in books and movies like ''The Ice Storm.'' That side of things does exist, particularly on the ''gold coast'' that runs along the southwest edge of the state, where many hedge-fund managers and movie stars live. And yet much of the state is heavily industrialized, or at least it was until the 1970s. According to data compiled by the Brookings Institution that looks at the core cities of the 100 largest metropolitan areas, two of Connecticut's largest cities -- Hartford and New Haven -- are now among the dozen poorest in the country. Hartford, the capital, is the poorest in America.
The effects of this kind of industrial decline, politically, were so gradual as to be almost imperceptible on a daily basis, but cumulatively they took a toll on the political climate. Fear of crime created political pressure for stricter sentencing guidelines, which drove up the state's incarceration costs significantly. College graduates went off to other regions in search of jobs, leaving behind an aging population whose Medicaid costs are soaring. Public-sector unions replaced trade unions as the dominant political force, and soon the state was paying out unsustainable retirement benefits to its employees. The state budget has grown 60 percent in the last decade, sustained mainly by an income tax that everyone hates.
And then there's the corruption, the sudden proliferation of which nobody I talked to in the state could adequately explain. No fewer than half a dozen major political scandals erupted in the past several years. Bridgeport's former mayor just got out of jail after, among other things, accepting free gifts from city contractors; Hartford's mayor is headed in for doing the same thing; and Waterbury's onetime mayor (a convicted sex offender) isn't getting out anytime soon. Governor Rowland, who also accepted free services from contractors, resigned from office in 2004 and served 10 months in prison.
Voter outrage at both parties, but particularly at Democrats, has been building since at least 2006. That's when Ned Lamont, a cable-television executive whose great-grandfather was a partner at J. P. Morgan, defeated Joe Lieberman in a primary that focused mostly on the war in Iraq. (Lieberman went on to win re-election as an independent.) This year, Lamont spent $9 million to run for governor against another of his party's entrenched politicians, a former Stamford mayor named Dan Malloy, but without a single galvanizing issue like the one he rode four years ago, he found himself unable to stir much passion from the disillusioned Democratic base, and lost.
The next incumbent after Lieberman to feel the walls closing in was Dodd, who just a few years ago seemed very likely to live out his days in the Senate. Instead, he decided not to seek a sixth term after polls revealed he had very little chance of winning. Dodd is the chairman of the banking committee and is the second-ranking Democratic member on the health-and-education committee -- hard-won appointments that would, at another time, have made him seem virtually indispensable to the state. Instead, even fellow Democrats pilloried Dodd for his close ties to Wall Street executives, who make up a significant part of the state's economy. In other words, Dodd was blasted as a sellout to his state for championing the interests of what had always been, up to now anyway, a crucial constituency.
The state has lost 103,000 jobs and counting during the current recession. And so the moment would seem well primed for Republican officeholders, who don't control the government in Washington. The problem for Connecticut Republicans is that they don't really have a lot of candidates left from which to choose. Ever since the party took a hard right turn in the 1980s, it has been slowly disappearing from the state. The last of the state's moderate Republican congressmen, Rob Simmons and Chris Shays, were defeated in the past two election cycles. (Simmons, who was the national party's choice to run against Blumenthal, was one candidate Linda McMahon defeated in the primary.) The one centrist Republican on the statewide scene, Gov. Jodi Rell, is retiring. The Republican who is bidding to replace her, a longtime party fund-raiser named Tom Foley, is, like McMahon, a self-financed candidate from Greenwich who had never run for office.
''The Republican Party is a nonentity in Connecticut today,'' Weicker, who formed his own party when he ran successfully for governor in 1990, told me when I visited him at his home in Old Lyme. ''It can't find men or women that have come through the chairs to get to where they are. They find people with a wad of dough who just try to buy the office.'' (Dodd, who said he was shocked when McMahon got the Republican nomination, puts it another way: ''Her main selling point is money.'')
Coincidentally, and a little oddly, Weicker sits on McMahon's board at W.W.E. After a lengthy discussion of the health care reform law, I asked him if McMahon, who favors repeal, knew what she was talking about. ''No,'' he answered, waving me away as if I had just asked whether either of his large dogs could fly. ''I think she's following the Republican line -- to say no.''
Contrary to conventional thought, you can't just go out and buy yourself a substantial political office in America. Al Checchi spent $40 million trying to become governor of California in 1998 and couldn't get past the Democratic primary. Tom Golisano, a New York businessman and philanthropist, spent $93 million on three futile attempts to become that state's governor between 1994 and 2002. The Texas entrepreneur H. Ross Perot spent $60 million during his 1992 campaign, back when 60 million bucks really meant something in presidential politics, and even though he won 19 percent of the vote, all anyone really remembers are a couple of flip charts and some ''Saturday Night Live'' skits. That said, $50 million -- which is most likely a very conservative estimate of what Linda McMahon calls ''investing in myself'' -- will get you a serious hearing in a state the size of Connecticut. And the way McMahon goes about spending her wrestling fortune is about as subtle as a folding chair to the skull.
Two days after the primary, I arrived at McMahon's headquarters in the swanky suburb of West Hartford. The headquarters looked more like some interior-design-by-appointment showroom than any campaign office I had ever seen. The glass storefront, over which the word ''Linda'' was elegantly stenciled in small letters on a navy blue awning, sat between a toy store and an exclusive clothing boutique that had a rack of summer dresses on the brick sidewalk.
Inside, brand new iPads, still in their packaging, lay scattered on desks where you might have expected to see discarded pizza boxes. Upstairs, where the press aides sat, a dozen or so flat-screen TVs hung from a futuristic grid of metal rods, with a stack of digital recorders within easy reach. It felt as if McMahon were campaigning to be commander of Starfleet.
In person, McMahon has a confident, likable presence. Her voice retains the lilt of her native North Carolina, and she laughs easily and warmly, with the sense of humor of a woman who had no problem pretending to violently feud with her husband in front of a national television audience. She is also intensely disciplined with a script, and repeatedly, in the course of our hourlong conversation, she came back to her central theme -- that what was missing in Washington were officials who understood what it took to make a small business work. ''I've built a business,'' she told me right off. ''I've put capital at risk. I understand what rules and regulations and taxes do to business.''
At another point, she told me: ''What I continued to hear even before I got into the race was: 'Do we not have anybody who's run a business, who can be a part of government? Can government not be run more as a business, with a little bit of attention to the bottom line?' ''
What McMahon has in mind for the country, more specifically, is to slash or freeze a slate of corporate taxes, while also abolishing the estate tax and the gift tax and creating a series of new deductions for capital expenditures. Businesses will create jobs, McMahon says, when the government stops taking so much of their money away and wasting it on so-called public investments, and those jobs will in turn lift more Americans into affluence.
If all this stirs in you a feeling of nostalgia, like the songs on McMahon's campaign soundtrack, that's because it is a perfect distillation of what was once called ''supply-side economics,'' the gift that Ronald Reagan bequeathed to America in the 1980s and that George W. Bush then regifted in a sparkly new box. In fact, McMahon's economic plan is largely the work of the economist and sometime television commentator John Rutledge, a supply-side evangelist who helped design Reagan's program back in the day.
The supply-side argument, which George H. W. Bush once derided as ''voodoo economics,'' is prevalent among conservative candidates running this year. But as David Stockman, who was Reagan's first budget director, argued in a Times Op-Ed essay in July, supply-siders during the Reagan and second Bush eras proved far more adept at cutting taxes than they did at scaling back federal spending, which is the main reason we have trillion-dollar budgets deficits. And so it would seem to be incumbent on a candidate like McMahon, who also rails against the debt and who advocates a balanced budget in Washington, to articulate some specific idea of where the budget can be scaled back.
I asked her, for instance, whether she was in favor of reforming entitlement programs that, along with military outlays, represent the principal forces driving spending levels ever higher. ''We're going to have to look at them,'' she said, ''but I can tell you that that has got to be done in the legislative arena, with open debate, with people on both sides really tackling this and talking about it. We've got to strengthen our entitlement programs. We've got to make sure that our contract with seniors is maintained and upheld.'' But, she added: ''I've made a specific point of saying I'm not going to go into that on the campaign trail, because I don't think that's appropriate. I think the appropriate arena is the legislative arena.''
In other words, this business of governance was too serious to be discussed in any detail during a campaign, which McMahon seemed to regard more as an exercise in theater, like ''Saturday Night's Main Event.'' Instead, she returned, once again, to the value of her business experience.
''What I've said to people as I've gone around the state,'' McMahon said, ''is: 'Look, I don't have all the answers. I wish I had a magic wand and could go to Washington and wave it. But one thing that you will have from me is to take my 30 years of experience, roll up my sleeves. I built a company with 24/7 sweat equity, and I don't think you can take your eye off the ball until you can solve all these issues and keep working at them.' ''
For Republicans, the surprising win by the Tea Party candidate Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, in a Senate race they now seem resigned to losing, has made the campaign in Connecticut more pivotal. It is hard to see how Republicans can retake the Senate without capturing Dodd's seat in November. But Democrats in Washington don't seem terribly worried about McMahon's candidacy. For one thing, they are confident that the details of McMahon's lifestyle and her involvement in a steroid-addled industry won't sit well with the state's well-mannered voters. McMahon had a yacht called Sexy Bitch, and the most famous video clip of her -- shown by a Republican opponent in the primary -- shows her kicking Jim Ross, a W.W.E. announcer, in the groin.
And Democrats remain bullish on Blumenthal, a fixture in Connecticut politics for 25 years who has already won five statewide elections. Blumenthal's campaign suffered through an existential crisis in May, after Raymond Hernandez reported in The Times that Blumenthal repeatedly misled voters about having served in Vietnam. But Blumenthal apologized -- after several agonizing days -- and maintained his double-digit lead over McMahon in the polls. This advantage, which has since narrowed considerably, led elated Democrats to conclude that if he could survive that kind of scandal with hardly a hiccup, then he could very likely survive anything McMahon might throw at him.
Near the end of my interview with McMahon, I asked her how exactly she intended to take on Blumenthal in a reliably Democratic state. What was her critique of a man the voters seemed to find eminently acceptable, even after his integrity had been called into question? McMahon didn't hesitate.
''The voters in Connecticut are going to have a very clear choice in November,'' she told me, describing Blumenthal as ''a career politician'' who has never created a single job. ''He's been in the lawsuit business. His business is suing people. My business is creating jobs. My business is adding and building to the economy. So it's just a very clear choice.''
She paused and held up a hand to literally frame the choice for me. ''The primary differences are career politician versus businesswoman,'' McMahon said, sounding very much like a human bullet point.
If McMahon's sleek storefront command center was the antithesis of what one would expect from a campaign office, then Blumenthal's headquarters in downtown Hartford was depressingly predictable. It is just the kind of ground-floor suite that campaigns rent for nothing, with faded dingy walls and industrial-strength carpet to match, illuminated by yellowy fluorescent bulbs. When I met Blumenthal there, the day after my conversation with McMahon, he showed me into an office that was bare except for a couple of chairs and a battered wooden desk.
After decades on the immediate periphery of the state's Democratic landscape, always next in line for a Senate seat but biding his time with the patience of a monk, Blumenthal is a recognizable brand in Connecticut. He doggedly shows up everywhere, listens attentively, takes copious notes and makes prudent statements. He has sued or subpoenaed tobacco companies and subprime-mortgage lenders, to name just a few, and even took on MySpace (in order to get the names of sex offenders) -- a record of ''standing up'' for businesses and families that, more than any one issue, forms the basis of his pitch to voters. Surprisingly boyish for a man of 64, with prominent ears and squinty eyes, he comes across as earnest and a little robotic. ''One of my most important strengths in this race is that people know me,'' Blumenthal told me. ''Not just from the TV, but personally. I've been to the parades and the fairs and the funerals and the christenings and, you know, places where people talk and interact.'' He added, ''I think that personal touch is still very important to people.''
Blumenthal said he can understand why Connecticut voters seemed enraged at anyone in power these days. ''I feel the anger and frustration about the way Washington is failing to listen and to respond,'' he said carefully. ''And I share it, because I've fought it as well. So, you know, some of the sense of distance and frustration and even anger -- I feel it as a public servant and as a citizen. It's very well justified, and I share it.''
Blumenthal didn't sound angry; he sounded as if he were dictating a letter. But this was his message, and he steered back to it no less than three more times in a 20-minute conversation. ''So when people are angry and frustrated about what's happening in Washington, they're right,'' he said at one point. ''They're dead right.'' And then: ''I'm an outsider to Washington.'' And later: ''I'm as frustrated and angry as anyone.''
Blumenthal has faithfully done the people's business all these years, in a way that has apparently gratified them. But now that his moment has arrived, just having been in office for all that time turns out to be his most significant vulnerability. It may not help that Blumenthal just seems so stereotypically incumbent. Even if he hadn't been in office for a quarter century already, it would probably feel as if he had.
The assault on Blumenthal's Vietnam half-truths didn't stick with the voters because it didn't reinforce anything they already believed about him. This is how it is in politics; because the voters long ago decided that this Blumenthal guy they kept reading about was basically an honest sort, it will likely take more than a few misstatements to derail him. But the other argument that McMahon is just now beginning to make, that Blumenthal is your typical insider, a lifelong politician who just doesn't get what they're going through -- this is an attack that might flower in the current environment, and he seems to know it.
And so perhaps Washington Democrats should be more concerned about McMahon and the challenge she presents. At a time when unemployment in the state hovers around 9 percent, voters may not especially care about McMahon's yacht or whether she gave her wrestlers health care plans or tacitly encouraged them to shoot up steroids. (And, in any event, it's doubtful they consider anything that happened at W.W.E. to be so much less respectable than the path traveled by some of the investment bankers and trial lawyers who have made it to the Senate.)
McMahon is a talented candidate, in the sense that she knows how to choose a point and drive it home, and you can bet she will spend the next six weeks hammering away at the center of the electorate -- that is, at all those civic-minded former Republicans in Connecticut who routinely provide Democrats their margins of victory but who long for a better alternative. She has been careful not to box herself into any positions that might strike voters as kind of wacky, unlike the party's Senate candidates in Kentucky (where Rand Paul qualified his support for the Civil Rights Act) and Nevada (where Sharron Angle has suggested that voters might look for ''Second Amendment remedies'' to a dysfunctional Congress). There is little Tea Party presence to speak of in Connecticut, and so McMahon was never caught having to take a stand on repealing the direct election of senators or anything like that. She is pro-choice and pro-stem-cell research, and she supports Connecticut's right to codify gay marriages -- all positions well within the mainstream of the state's moderate electorate.
Blumenthal told me he takes ''nothing for granted,'' and apparently he means it. The day after I saw him, he left a phone message for my mother, who still lives in Trumbull. He knew my late father, a trial lawyer, and he wanted her to know he enjoyed talking with me, he said, and he left his home number. It was old-school, detail-oriented politics (what mother doesn't want to hear kind words about her son?), and I had to admire the effort. But when I asked her about it later, my mother said she never called him back.
For the better part of three decades, from the years after World War II until his death in 1975, John Bailey was the most important man in Connecticut politics. Your classic cigar-chomping party boss of the industrial age, Bailey served as chairman of the state Democratic Party through five presidencies and as the party's national chairman for seven years in the 1960s. He is said to have wielded nearly absolute power in the state's urban wards, the force behind second-generation Irish, Italian and Jewish politicians who went on to long careers.
Paul Timpanelli, who runs Bridgeport's business council -- and who, as a young Democratic politician back in the 1980s, gave me my first summer internship -- is just old enough to remember the tail end of that era, and over lunch at one of Bridgeport's few really good downtown restaurants, he marveled at how party politics had changed. Specifically, Timpanelli was talking about how state Democrats failed to rally behind Dodd earlier this year -- how they seemingly did not know how to offer an endangered incumbent, a man who served for 30 years in the Senate and became a giant of state politics, any incentive to seek re-election.
''John Bailey would have offered him the world, and he would have given the world,'' Timpanelli told me. When I mentioned this to Dodd, he agreed. ''The party apparatus didn't seem to be there or know how to handle this,'' he said, speaking of the erosion in his standing.
Party bosses like Bailey are a thing of the past in Connecticut, as most everywhere else. So is the party loyalty they inspired. As recently as 1982, Democrats in Connecticut made up 40 percent of the electorate, with Republicans making up about 27 percent and unaffiliated voters another third. By 2010, Democrats actually slipped a few points, to 37 percent, while Republican affiliation fell to 20 percent. Some 42 percent of the state's voters now identify themselves as independent, a number that has been rising for 20 years.
Connecticut in my parents' day was the kind of state in which institutions really mattered -- religious congregations and city newspapers and insurance companies, garden clubs and the Knights of Columbus, with their towering headquarters in New Haven. Connecticut voters, like voters in a lot of the country, trusted in an established order that seemed to be working pretty well for them, but then people saw their cities and their industries collapse, and even the Catholic Church was tainted by scandal, and elected officials started selling their services for home improvements.
And this is what makes a Linda McMahon possible here and in other parts of America -- not just her millions of dollars or the crippled economy, but the sense that the establishment has lost its credibility. It is something McMahon, having built a megaentertainment business without the imprimatur of cultural arbiters, intuitively understood about politics. The more her party's leadership tried to write her off, the more Democrats scoffed at her candidacy, the more viable she became.
I was discussing the mood in the state recently with Tom D'Amore, a former state Republican chairman who has long since bolted the party, when suddenly he told me a story about his father, an Electrolux vacuum salesman who smoked more than a pack a day for most of his life. ''One day, it must have been in the 1960s sometime, he just quit,'' D'Amore told me. ''Cold turkey. I said to him, 'Dad, why did you suddenly decide to stop smoking?' And I'll never forget it. He pointed a finger at me'' -- and here D'Amore demonstrated by grimly pointing one at me -- ''and he said: 'The surgeon general of the United States says smoking can kill you. And they wouldn't lie about a thing like that.'
''I mean, can you imagine anyone saying that now?'' D'Amore asked me. ''In that generation, government really displayed by its actions that it was a force for good.'' He leaned back in his chair and shook his head.
''Nobody here thinks that way anymore.''

TIMOTHY EGAN Travel is good for many things, not the least of which is testing your national values against those of other countries. But perhaps the best way to judge the health of a nation's heart is by how it treats the shunned. Plagued by low poll numbers, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy this summer set out to dismantle Gypsy camps and deport the people to Romania and Bulgaria. It has proven to be a popular move at home, but prompted a stinging rebuke from the European Union's justice commissioner, Viviane Reding: she compared the expulsions to ethnic cleansing by the Nazis. 
As often happens when the morally indignant let their passions get the best of them, the justice commissioner's comparison was over the top. Sarkozy's deportation is simply a crass political move, and a huge hurdle for poor people who have to gather all their belongings and start anew in another country.
Americans don't have a ''Gypsy problem,'' as such. But bad economic times tend to bring out base instincts. Sarkozy's role model might just as well have been Jan Brewer, the governor of Arizona with the invertebrate political principles.

HEADLINE: Brother Defeats Brother In British Labour Party

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- In a battle of the brothers for the leadership of Britain's Labour Party, the younger of the two, Ed Miliband, 40, was elected on Saturday, beating his brother David, the 45-year-old former foreign minister, by a margin of a little more than 1 percent of the votes in a runoff.
With his victory over his brother and three other candidates, Ed Miliband became the successor to the former prime minister, Gordon Brown, at Labour's helm, and faced the challenge of regenerating the party after its demoralizing defeat by the Conservatives in May's general election. In his acceptance speech, he acknowledged that the party had ''lost the election, and lost it badly,'' and spoke of the ''scale of the journey'' to regain power. 
''I recognize it will not be easy,'' he told delegates to Labour's five-day annual conference in Manchester.
The four-month contest involved five contestants, but it resolved early on into a two-man race between the Miliband brothers, both ministers in the defeated Brown government and both Oxford graduates, though each with roots in a different Labour camp: Ed Miliband broadly identifies with the party's traditionalist left wing and Mr. Brown, who made him energy and climate change minister in his government, and David Miliband with the reformist movement known as New Labour, which carried Tony Blair to three successive victories before he yielded as prime minister to Mr. Brown in 2007.
Ed Miliband's victory seemed certain to be celebrated, at least privately, by the Conservatives. The political editor of the left-leaning Guardian newspaper, Patrick Wintour, wrote a Website blog item suggesting that Prime Minister David Cameron, the 43-year-old Conservative leader, would be ''punching the air'' at seeing the win by the Miliband brother favored by Labour's left wing.
Mr. Cameron made a congratulatory phone call to the winner but used an interview in Saturday's editions of The Daily Telegraph, suggested an indifference to which brother won. ''They're both part of the team that got us into this mess,'' he said, referring to the $240 billion annual deficit the new government inherited from Labour, its causes the main battleground between the two parties. ''In this long leadership debate, I haven't heard a single suggestion about how we might deal with the deficit.''
The contest also served as a window on the Milibands' redoubtable family.
Their father, Ralph Miliband, was a Marxist intellectual and writer who reached Britain from Belgium in 1940 after fleeing advancing Nazi forces. Their mother, Marion Kozak, also a left-wing activist, arrived with her family from Poland in the early 1950s. Ralph Miliband is buried beside Karl Marx in London's Highgate Cemetery, while his widow, Marion, at 76, remains active in Labour.
Ultimately, the leadership battle demonstrated the uneasy alliance Labour has become over the last 15 years, between the New Labour reformists, with their centrist emphasis on policies appealing to business and the middle class, and the left-wing loyalists, traditionalists who had sublimated their ideological differences with the Blairites to the common urge to return to power in 1997 after 18 years of Conservative rule.
The differing approaches remained unresolved though the party's years in power, and infused the personal rivalry between Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown, which partly paralyzed the governments of both men, particularly on matters of social and economic policy. Mr. Brown quit the party leadership and the prime ministership simultaneously as the new coalition government of David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats was formed, leaving the Labour leadership contest as a forum for continued skirmishing.
In the end, union power decided the contest. The outcome was on a knife's edge until the final moments because of the complexity of the party's electoral college, which divides the leadership vote into three equal blocs -- members of the British and European parliaments, Labour Party members, and members of affiliated unions.
In the final count, Ed Miliband secured a margin of more than 6 percent over David Miliband in the union count, eclipsing the the older brother's lead among Labour's Parliament members and its general membership.
Before the result was announced, delegates gave an enthusiastic welcome to Mr. Brown, who virtually disappeared from public view after the May defeat, and took a personal pounding from Mr. Blair's autobiography, published this month. It offered a detailed chronicle of their personal rivalry, describing Mr. Brown at one point as ''weird.'' After quitting Downing Street, Mr. Brown, 59, moved to his family home near Edinburgh, and stayed neutral in the leadership battle.
For Ed Miliband, a long wait seemed likely. Recent polls show Labour pulling back to parity with the Conservatives in popular support, after trailing them by 7 percent in May's voting. A turbulent passage for the new government lies ahead, after its expected Oct. 20 announcement of the details of its austerity plan, amounting to as much as a five-year, 25 percent cut for most government departments. The coalition plans a new law that would give it five years to govern, with the next election set for May 2015.
But Labour's history has been one of long periods of opposition after losing power -- 13 years after its defeat by Winston Churchill's Conservatives in 1951, 18 years after losing to Margaret Thatcher in 1979. And Mr. Miliband faces the challenge of doing something Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown never achieved,uniting the party's contending wings and ending what David Miliband's campaign manager, Douglas Alexander, described as the party's habit of forming ''a circular firing squad'' after losing elections.
After his win in Manchester, Mr. Miliband set a modest target. ''In time,'' he said, ''I hope to serve the country.''

HEADLINE: If Congress Stalls, Do Stocks Rise?

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IS political gridlock really good for the stock market?
Conventional wisdom, rooted in derisive humor, says it is. ''This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as we do when the baby gets hold of a hammer,'' Will Rogers wrote in The New York Times on July 5, 1930. ''It's just a question of how much damage he can do with it before you can take it away from him.''
He said that while the House had recessed for Independence Day, the Senate, alas, was about to reconvene. ''Prosperity will pick up only 50 percent,'' he said. 
Take Congress's hammer away, or at least make it impossible for politicians to do much damage with it, and businesspeople will focus on making money. And -- presto! -- the markets will rise.
That view is still widely held on Wall Street, and it has particular relevance this year, because the Democratic Party, which controls the White House, the House and the Senate, might lose control of Congress in the November election. Total gridlock -- with neither party able to enact any major legislation -- might follow.
This could provide riveting political theater. But would it help the financial markets?
A review of history suggests that it would not. ''The conventional wisdom is that gridlock is good for the stock market, but there's no evidence that that's been true over the last 84 years,'' said H. Douglas Witte, a finance professor at Missouri State University, who crunched the numbers for Sunday Business.
He defined ''governmental gridlock'' as a period when no single party controlled the White House and both chambers in Congress. From 1926 through last year, an index of large-capitalization stocks returned about 7 percent, annualized, when there was gridlock, compared with about 12 percent when there was not.
Despite some years of surging stock markets during divided governments in the Reagan and Clinton administrations, those stretches were outweighed in the long historical record by lagging returns in other years.
Oddly enough, while the data doesn't support the idea that gridlock is beneficial, it does show that stocks fare better when Congress is out of session, much as Rogers suggested. Along with Michael F. Ferguson of the University of Cincinnati, Professor Witte corroborated this finding in a 2006 paper.
The researchers found that more than 90 percent of the price gains over the 108-year life of the Dow Jones industrial average through 2006 came on days when Congress was out of session. And in periods when polls showed that Congress was least popular, this ''Congressional effect'' was most pronounced.
Their work was inspired by a 1992 article in Barron's titled, ''Legislator Go Home!'' by Eric T. Singer, then an investment banker, who reached the same conclusions. Two years ago, he founded the Congressional Effect mutual fund, which has outperformed the market. The fund's strategy is to abandon stocks when Congress meets, and to invest in them when it recesses.
The idea, he said, is ''to capture the returns of the stock market while limiting political risk.''
Why should the Congressional effect work? Professors Witte and Ferguson aren't sure, but have three possible explanations.
One might be called the Will Rogers-Mark Twain theory. (In his autobiography, Twain wrote: ''Suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.'') Because Congress has historically been held in low esteem, this explanation suggests, Congressional activity drags down the public mood, depressing prices.
Another might be called the populist thesis: investors conclude that Congress isn't acting in the public interest, the professors write, but ''rather in the service of powerful financial and economic incumbents,'' and this is most obvious when Congress meets.
Most probable, Professor Witte said, is a third explanation, that investors are unnerved by ''regulatory uncertainty,'' which rises when Congress is active. When the atmosphere clears and Congress goes home, investors are more likely to bid up prices.
But tensions may rise in periods of split government, when the two parties are at loggerheads, and this could add to perceptions of uncertainty, sometimes leading to market underperformance. ''Uncertainty seems to be a key factor,'' said Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, an investment consulting firm, who has found that any change in the political control of Congress seems to have a ''modestly negative effect'' on markets.
A more powerful cyclical effect, he said, is the tendency of markets to rise in the third year of a presidential term, particularly for first-term presidents. But that's the subject of another column.
If government action is crucial, then gridlock is not an attractive outcome. Ethan S. Harris, chief North American economist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, says that because of an unusual series of ''automatic mechanisms'' built into the law this year, if Congress is gridlocked, the result could be ''disastrous.''
On Dec. 31, he said, not only do Bush-era tax cuts expire, but tax breaks enacted in the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus program will also disappear. In addition, he said, there could be a $60 billion tax increase if Congress can't adjust another levy, the alternative minimum tax. ''Put it all together and there is a potential $300 billion shock to the economy,'' he said, and that could bring on a recession.
''I can't imagine a time in modern history where gridlock has been more of a problem than it would be right now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What The Rich Don't Need

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
WANT to give affluent households a present worth $700 billion over the next decade? In a period of high unemployment and fiscal austerity, this idea may seem laughable. Amazingly, though, it is getting traction in Washington.
I am referring, of course, to the current debate about whether to extend all, or just some, of the tax cuts of President George W. Bush -- cuts that are due to expire at year-end. They're expiring because the only way they could be enacted initially was by pretending that they were temporary.
In this situation, it's not clear what should be called a tax ''cut.'' If the temporary law is allowed to expire as planned, does that represent a return to normal, or a tax increase? Conversely, if some parts of the current rates are extended, should those count as a tax cut? 
Psychologists call these descriptive choices ''framing.'' No one is proposing that tax rates be lower than they are now, so the question is whether some people should pay more, and, if so, who.
President Obama has proposed retaining the current rates on incomes up to $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples. Under this plan, everyone would receive a tax ''cut'' relative to the rates in effect in the Clinton era. For a family with a $250,000 income or more, the cut would be about $6,000, because its first $250,000 of income would be subject to the current, lower rate. But such families would have a higher bill than they do now.
With the exception of the House minority leader, John Boehner, the Republican leadership has drawn a line in the sand, saying it will oppose Mr. Obama's bill unless all taxpayers remain at current rates. Although it wouldn't put it this way, the Republican position is, in effect, that if the rich can't share in the bounty, rates should rise for everyone.
They offer three arguments to support their view.
The first is that it is folly to raise taxes in a weak economy. There is some merit to this argument, of course, but economic policy is always about trade-offs.
Tax cuts are one of many ways to stimulate the economy. Building infrastructure, for example, is another. We have to choose. And if the primary goal is stimulating the economy, tax breaks to the rich are simply not cost-effective. Numerous studies have shown that the poor spend nearly all of their income, while the rich save a significant amount of theirs.
The second argument is that not extending the tax cuts to high-income earners would impose an excessive burden on small businesses. Here, however, we fall into a statistical morass. The administration points out that only 3 percent of all businesses earn enough to have to pay any additional tax. But Republicans reply that those 3 percent of businesses earn 47 percent of the income from this entire sector, meaning that the higher taxes would apply to the bulk of small-business income.
Which is the most relevant number?
To understand these statistics, we need to know how small business is defined. The data come from tax returns, and the definition of a ''small'' business is one that is organized so that all the profits pass through to the owners, who then report these profits as income on their personal tax returns.
Partnerships and firms structured as S corporations are examples. This category can include businesses as diverse as barbershops, car washes, hedge funds and law firms. Goldman Sachs was in this category before it became a public company. And the fact that 3 percent of the businesses earn nearly half of the money is precisely what many people are concerned about: growing income inequality.
Which brings us to the third argument. Conservatives say that to do anything other than extending tax cuts to everyone would amount to ''class warfare.''
The best response to that notion comes from Warren E. Buffett: ''There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.''
Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, two academic economists, provide data to back up Mr. Buffett's view. They show that the proportion of income earned by the top 1 percent of American families was about 10 percent of the national total from 1945 to 1979. Since 1980, that share has doubled, reaching about 20 percent in 2008 -- or more, if capital gains are included.
The growth rate has been even faster for the ultrarich -- those in the top one-hundredth of 1 percent in income.
Other segments of society, meanwhile, are losing out, with their share of the total declining, and their real incomes remaining stagnant.
And what about incentives? Will the owners of the profitable small businesses work less hard, or hire fewer people, if their own after-tax income falls? This is a much-researched question, and the weight of current evidence suggests that we shouldn't expect significant real reductions in economic activity if rates change in the range under discussion.
There is another possible argument for including the rich in these tax cuts, one based on ''fairness.'' By this reasoning, the wealthy are entitled to low tax rates because they have temporarily had them, and it would now be unfair to take them back.
But by that same argument, unemployment insurance should never expire, and every day should be your birthday. ''Temporary'' has no meaning if it bestows a permanent right.
The question comes down to whether we want a society in which the rich take an ever-increasing share of the pie, or prefer to return to conditions that allow all classes to anticipate an increasing standard of living. Demanding that the rich get a tax cut as a condition for tax relief for others is simply elitist. Tea Partiers, take note.

HEADLINE: Listen Up: Yes, I Feel Your Pain

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD; John Harwood, a political writer for The Times, is chief Washington correspondent for CNBC.

 BODY:
MY homework for an hourlong interview with President Obama last week began with reviews of his earlier speeches and interviews, and conversations with economists and political operatives. It ended around a dinner table.
That's where, over salad and swordfish, former aides to another Democratic president, Bill Clinton, explored principal questions hanging over the coming midterm elections. How can Mr. Obama do better at defending his record and his party's candidates from the wrath of an unhappy electorate? Why doesn't he receive more credit for winning passage of expanded health care coverage, new financial regulations and an economic stimulus package that many independent economists say helped end the Great Recession? Why can't he get his message out?
Republicans argue that it's because Mr. Obama has expanded the size of government and swelled federal deficits, with little to show for it, in the face of public resistance. But Democrats, who share the president's philosophy, look for other explanations.
The former Clinton aides, like many pundits, turned to Mr. Obama's cool, cerebral public style. Emotional connection was an aspect of leadership at which Mr. Clinton, for better or worse, excelled. If only Mr. Obama could more effectively demonstrate empathy, they argued, he might be able to convince the supporters he thrilled in 2008 that he's still on their side. 
That observation has gained wide acceptance in Washington. Mr. Obama may have played like a rock star in the campaign arenas of 2008, according to this view, but he displays a Spock-like emotional aridity in more intimate settings. In reality, however, a look back at previous midterm elections, especially during economic weakness, suggests that dollars and cents matter far more than hugs or lip-biting.
It's not that the Obama administration isn't striving to touch economically squeezed voters in more direct and personal ways. Mr. Obama risked criticism for breaching presidential decorum by appearing on ''The View.'' He has begun holding backyard meetings with suburban families.
Last week's hourlong ''town hall'' on CNBC, which I moderated, was part of that effort. But Mr. Obama declined to offer any Oprah-style emotional revelation when I asked whether his unusual background -- as a biracial child who spent part of his youth overseas, then attended Ivy League schools -- made it harder to connect with average Americans.
''When the unemployment rate is so high and people are having a tough time, it doesn't matter if I was green, it doesn't matter if I was purple,'' he said matter-of-factly. ''I think people would still be frustrated.''
Perhaps that was a moment missed, but history offers scant evidence to think so.
Despite President Dwight D. Eisenhower's celebrated World War II record, voters didn't ''like Ike'' enough to keep his fellow Republicans from losing 48 House seats amid the 1958 recession. For all his talents, Mr. Clinton watched his party lose control of both the House and Senate in the 1994 midterm election, in which economic weakness was one of many factors. ''We have a controlled experiment,'' observed Stan Greenberg, one of Mr. Clinton's pollsters, downplaying the significance of Mr. Obama's empathic skills. ''Clearly Bill Clinton had the ability to connect emotionally. He got slaughtered in 1994.''
Moreover, the unemployment rate Mr. Clinton faced then never got higher than 6.6 percent -- nowhere near the 9.6 percent rate Mr. Obama faces today. Late last year, notwithstanding his stimulus program, unemployment hit 10 percent for the first time since the 1982 recession, during Ronald Reagan's presidency.
After studying their predecessors in similar circumstances, aides to Mr. Obama have come to see Mr. Reagan's challenging midterm campaign that year as something of a model. ''This one feels more like 1982 than 1994,'' said Daniel Pfeiffer, the White House communications director.
Mr. Reagan, like Mr. Obama, had assumed immense economic challenges after succeeding a deeply unpopular president of the other party. After persuading Congress to cut tax rates and spending, Mr. Reagan beseeched voters to ''stay the course,'' and warned against a return to the policies of Jimmy Carter and tax-and-spend Congressional Democrats. He held Republican losses to 26 House seats -- a level that, if repeated this year, would allow Democrats to retain control of the chamber.
It's easy to forget how politically weak Mr. Reagan appeared for much of that year. According to Gallup, Mr. Obama's current mid-40s approval ratings are comparable to or slightly higher than Mr. Reagan's at a similar point in 1982 (as well as Mr. Clinton's in 1994).
Mr. Obama aims to use President George W. Bush's record in the same way Mr. Reagan used Mr. Carter's. It was Mr. Bush and his Republican allies in Congress, he tells campaign audiences, who drove the economy ''into a ditch.''
The velocity of contemporary media, not to mention its ferocity, may render that argument more difficult to make. In the ever-advancing news cycle, on cable television and the Internet, news tends to get old faster.
Thus, Mr. Pfeiffer asserted, in 1982 ''Carter's presidency seemed more recent than Bush's presidency'' does to voters this year. To compensate, he added, Mr. Obama and his aides began t contrast themselves with Republicans long before the traditional Labor Day campaign kickoff. In any event, the raucous and frenetic quality of the Information Age almost certainly hinders Mr. Obama more than his demeanor.
The town hall ended up carrying an emotional wallop anyway. But it didn't come from my questions or Mr. Obama's answers. Instead, it came from an audience member, Velma Hart, a black Obama supporter who works at a service organization for military veterans.
''I'm exhausted -- exhausted of defending you, defending your administration,'' Ms. Hart said, looking straight at the president. ''I've been told that I voted for a man who said he was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class. I'm one of those people and I'm waiting, sir.''
Her riveting statement struck some observers as an embarrassing public relations setback for Mr. Obama. Jon Stewart, on Comedy Central's ''Daily Show,'' called Ms. Hart an ''Obama-sapping machine.''
White House aides hope that the exchange will have a different effect: to demonstrate that Mr. Obama isn't isolated inside the presidential ''bubble,'' deaf to the suffering a weak economy has engendered. As it happens, that view of the hour's emotional impact was endorsed by the master of the genre.
''I may be one of the few people that think it's not bad that that lady said she was getting tired of defending him,'' Mr. Clinton told Politico. ''He needs to hear it.''

HEADLINE: And in the Left Corner, Weighing In ...

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
''I'M one of those actors who finds the part in the wardrobe,'' Lawrence O'Donnell said. ''So this dressing like an anchorman thing is beginning to work.''
He had just bounded into his office at Rockefeller Center moments before noon on a Wednesday in mid-September, having finished the first full rehearsal the night before for his forthcoming talk show on MSNBC, ''The Last Word.'' He was wearing jeans and a black T-shirt; only his black dress shoes still tagged him as a ''man in makeup'' -- something he says he never aspired to be. He quickly kicked those off.
''It feels like we're about three months away from being ready to go,'' he said, maybe jokingly, maybe not.
But beginning Monday at 10 p.m. his show goes live, and Mr. O'Donnell will add another profession -- full-time cable-news anchor -- to his list of (mainly) behind-the-scenes role in Washington and Hollywood. 
The last time a Democrat was in the Oval Office, Mr. O'Donnell was the chief of staff of the Senate Finance Committee, whose chairman was Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mr. O'Donnell was a trusted adviser to Mr. Moynihan for years. Later he gravitated toward Hollywood, spending years writing for ''The West Wing,'' and shepherding the short-lived political dramas ''Mister Sterling'' and ''First Monday.'' Now with ''The Last Word,'' a title he devised himself, he's about to try to fuse those two worlds: Washington and Washington-as-entertainment.
''This is the only time since I left government that I've felt, 'Wow, it would be really fun to be in government now,' '' he said during the first of two interviews this month.
He had marked up President Obama's economic speech that day with a highlighter, and if he had been on the air, he would have dissected it and recommended improvements.
''I saw ways to make it better,'' he said.
During Mr. Obama's campaign, by contrast, ''I never felt that.''
Referring to the president's aides, he said, ''They know more about campaigns, especially for the presidency, than I do. They don't know more about governing than I do. So now they're in my zone.''
In the cable news world, the 10 o'clock hour is the time slot when CNN and the much higher-rated Fox News Channel wrap up their days with one final hour of news mixed, especially at Fox, with bombastic views. But MSNBC has never settled for long on a strategy for programming the tail end of the prime-time schedule. Now repeats of the 8 p.m. program, ''Countdown With Keith Olbermann,'' occupy the hour, and they garner a respectable rating; among 25- to 54-year-olds, the repeat is neck-and-neck with Anderson Cooper's live newscast on CNN. (Both trail ''On the Record With Greta Van Susteren'' on Fox News by a large margin.)
By adding ''The Last Word,'' MSNBC is finally filling out its prime-time schedule, giving it a full complement of prime-time hosts to serve as the liberal counterweight of the conservative torchbearers of Fox News.
It was Mr. Olbermann's ''Countdown'' that first showed MSNBC there was a substantial audience for anti-Bush administration, anti-Republican commentary. Two years ago during the presidential election it added a companion in ''The Rachel Maddow Show'' at 9. Then Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC, started thinking about adding a show at 10.
Ms. Maddow and Mr. O'Donnell were hired in much the same way: they were both substitutes for Mr. Olbermann, who managed to retain nearly all of his audience when he was away from work. But Mr. O'Donnell, unlike Ms. Maddow, has had a long history with the channel; he has been on the payroll since its founding in 1996, as a political analyst and as a very occasional weekend anchor. His appearances waxed and waned depending on his Hollywood commitments. ''A year ago Keith was taking a night off, and they needed somebody,'' he said.
Mr. Griffin recalled, ''I watched and thought, 'Holy cow,' Lawrence commanded the screen. In prime time, the people who work on cable news, they own the screen.'' Mr. Griffin signed him up as the permanent sub for Mr. Olbermann.
Some people campaigned mightily for the 10 p.m. time slot at MSNBC; Mr. O'Donnell is not one of those people. He turned down Mr. Griffin the first time the job was offered to him. He is, fundamentally, a writer and creator.
''What Lawrence would really like to be doing, he has told me many times, and everyone else I think, is writing and creating the TV show he and I have developed,'' said Kurt Andersen, the novelist and journalist. The two men have been preparing a pilot for HBO about the rich media set in New York City, but they don't know if it will be ordered as a series.
If it does become a series, the two men (and Mr. Griffin) are confident that Mr. O'Donnell can juggle both jobs. Asked why he accepted the MSNBC job, after rebuffing Mr. Griffin in the past, Mr. O'Donnell said: ''Well, there is the promo I'm desperate to do here at the network. I think it speaks a truth and lets the audience in on a reality and would be the most-talked-about promo in the history of television promos.''
The promo would have Mr. O'Donnell sitting at an angle to the camera, mimicking MSNBC's commercials for its hosts, and it would have him address ''why I do this job -- and it would just be -- quote -- 'I do it for the money.' ''
He waits for the laughter in his office to subside, and then says that his work in the Senate ''is the only thing I ever did not for the money.''
He also says that the Senate experience -- not his past acting gigs on ''Big Love'' and, briefly, on ''The West Wing'' -- is what is most relevant to his MSNBC job. If anything will differentiate Mr. O'Donnell's show from all the others on cable news, it will be that.
Like his prime-time colleagues on MSNBC, Mr. O'Donnell is staunchly liberal: he is a pacifist, he is opposed to the death penalty in every circumstance, and, he said, it is ''impossible to be to my left on health care -- there's no space.'' But as a product of the compromising body of the Senate, he comes across as much more pragmatic (and perhaps more understanding of the administration's situation) than Mr. Olbermann and Ms. Maddow. Mr. O'Donnell's conversations about campaigning and governing are predominantly tactical, not fantastical.
''I think a lot of people on both sides have extremely naive views of what government is capable of,'' he said. ''Republicans believe that tax cuts can build buildings, all sorts of miraculous things. A lot of Democrats and liberals believe that spending more money in a school is going to up the test scores, no matter how much evidence there is that it won't, or hasn't.''
As his senior executive producer, Izzy Povich, put it, ''his opinions are informed by his experience.''
Mr. Andersen elaborated. Mr. O'Donnell may not be ''driven by a utopian dream of a better America,'' he said, but ''he has very strong opinions.''
On ''The Last Word,'' Mr. O'Donnell said he would look for chances to make connections between seemingly disparate stories, the way fiction programs tie together the A, B and C stories in each episode. In a mock production meeting on Sept. 8, the top story of the day was the fringe pastor in Florida who planned to burn Korans. When a producer mentioned in passing that Iranian officials had put a woman's execution by stoning on hold, Mr. O'Donnell halted the meeting.
''There's connective tissue between these stories,'' he said. ''I'm wondering if we can take the stoning reprieve, tell that story and present it to the nut who wants to burn the Koran and say to him: 'Look, the Iranians have stepped down from the stoning of her. Do you want to consider maybe stepping back?' ''
The five producers at the table were all paying close attention. ''I don't, off the top of my head, know how to write them together, and it would normally take me three weeks,'' Mr. O'Donnell said.
''Three hours,'' Ms. Povich said. ''Go!''

HEADLINE: The Gloves Come Off Early For the Midterm Elections: Democrats Unleash Biting Ads Based on Rivals' Pasts

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Amanda Cox contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democratic candidates across the country are opening a fierce offensive of negative advertisements against Republicans, using lawsuits, tax filings, reports from the Better Business Bureau and even divorce proceedings to try to discredit their opponents and save their Congressional majority.
Opposition research and attack advertising are used in almost every election, but these biting ads are coming far earlier than ever before, according to party strategists. The campaign has intensified in the last two weeks as early voting begins in several states and as vulnerable incumbents try to fight off an onslaught of influences by outside groups.
As they struggle to break through with economic messages, many Democrats are deploying the fruits of a yearlong investigation into the business and personal histories of Republican candidates in an effort to plant doubts about them and avoid having races become a national referendum on the performance of President Obama and his party.
In Ohio, Representative Betty Sutton calls her Republican rival, Tom Ganley, a ''dishonest used-car salesman'' who has been sued more than 400 times for fraud, discrimination, lying to customers about repairs, overcharging them and endangering their safety. She warns voters, ''You've heard the old saying, buyer beware!'' 
In Arizona, Representative Harry E. Mitchell accused his opponent David Schweikert of being ''a predatory real estate speculator who snatched up nearly 300 foreclosed homes, been cited for neglect and evicted a homeowner on the verge of saving his house, just to make a buck.''
In New York, Representative Michael Arcuri introduces his Republican challenger, Richard Hanna, as a millionaire who ''got rich while his construction company overcharged taxpayers thousands, was sued three times for injuries caused by faulty construction and was cited 12 times for health and safety violations.''
Negative ads can be successful, whether or not they are fair and fully accurate, particularly if they lure an opponent into responding or if they define a political newcomer before he can define himself. But they also carry risks, especially in a year when voters are frustrated about the economy and impatient with politics as usual.
''Our strongest piece of opposition research on Democrats is their voting records,'' said Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''While character assassination seems to be the strategy for Democrats this year, the American people are supporting Republican candidates because they are providing an alternative.''
A debate has broken out among some Democratic officials about the effectiveness -- or wisdom -- of running such pointedly negative advertisements with five weeks remaining in the campaign. But party strategists said candidates did not have the luxury of waiting until the final stretch to go negative, particularly if the goal is to localize the races.
''When you're talking about whether an individual really belongs in Congress, you're not talking about the national issues,'' said Steve McMahon, a Democratic consultant who creates television advertising for several candidates in the party.
He added: ''Anytime you get personal in campaign advertising, there's always a risk that it goes too far to be credible or it backfires altogether. That risk is typically mitigated by research that's done in advance to determine the correct tone and what will make the ad credible.''
So far, many Republican candidates are forcefully defending themselves but not taking the bait by starting their own personal offensives. A review of television advertisements presented since Labor Day showed that the Republicans were basing theirs almost entirely on the records of Democrats on health care, the economic stimulus package and the first vote the Democrats cast when Congress convened in 2009: for making Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House.
Even many of the critical Republican advertisements produced by the candidates or the party are done with a softer touch. (Outside groups, which are investing record amounts of money for a midterm election, do not always follow suit.)
In Texas, Republicans are trying to defeat Representative Chet Edwards, a moderate Democrat who remains likable to many residents in his district, which includes the Crawford ranch of former President George W. Bush. An advertisement suggests that Mr. Edwards has changed in Washington, with a narrator calmly saying, ''After 20 years, he's not independent.''
In North Dakota, Rick Berg, a Republican trying to unseat Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat, decided to make his latest ad about negative ads. ''Isn't it time North Dakota has a congressman who will change Washington and not change the subject with a negative ad?'' Mr. Berg asked.
The Democratic ads are like a prosecutor's case, carrying no rebuttals or countervailing facts. Yet for all of the protestations that arise every election year about negative advertising, there is plenty of evidence that the attacks are effective, particularly against candidates without a deep connection to voters. This year, as Republicans work to gain at least the 39 seats they need to take control of the House, many of their nominees have never run for office and come from business backgrounds, which often include a trail of documents.
For more than a year, a large team of researchers at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been digging into the backgrounds of potential Republican candidates. It is political detective work, with every piece of a candidate's past fair game, so long as it is a part of the public record. In some cases, aides have been sent to districts for a closer look as they compile thorough dossiers, which are ultimately approved by a team of lawyers before the information is turned into television commercials.
Some of the material is rooted in policy, including the ''Fair Tax,'' a national sales tax pledge signed by many Republicans, which Democrats say would raise sales taxes by 23 percent. Many of the findings, however, are not rooted in legislation or policy.
In Tennessee, a Republican candidate accused his Democratic challenger of unearthing a divorce proceeding containing an accusation about intimidating his wife with a gun. In South Dakota, a poor driving record became a part of the dialogue after it was revealed that the Republican nominee for Congress had received 20 speeding tickets and numerous citations for failing to appear in court, running stop signs and not making payments, which twice resulted in arrest warrants.
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who leads the Republican recruitment effort in the House, said he warned candidates to conduct their own research before deciding to run so they were not surprised by anything dug up by Democrats.
''It's called winning ugly,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''But a lot of time it backfires, because people in their communities know them.''
Jim Renacci, the Republican nominee in Ohio's 16th Congressional District, has owned a car dealership, nursing homes, an arena football team and other businesses. Four years ago, he was assessed nearly $1.4 million in unpaid state taxes, interest and fees, which he ultimately paid. The issue has been replayed again and again in television advertisements from his opponent, Representative John Boccieri, and Democratic groups.
''There are lemons, and then there's used-car millionaire Jim Renacci,'' an announcer said in an advertisement last week, as images of an old rickety station wagon appeared on the screen before segueing to an unflattering photograph of Mr. Renacci.
In an interview, Mr. Renacci dismissed criticism about his business background, saying: ''He's going to go over my 30-year experience and try and find this little thing or that little thing. As far as I'm concerned, you always know you're doing well when your opponent is attacking.''

HEADLINE: THE '90S; A First Assault On the Twin Towers: March 4, 1993

BYLINE: By ROBERT STONE. 
ROBERT STONE is the author of ''Fun With Problems.''

 BODY:
PUT yourself in the mind's eye of the bomber. It's likely he first viewed the city from the air, looked out and saw the twin towers mirroring each other's dizzying rise. Or maybe he stood at the window of a safe house in Queens or New Jersey and looked at them thrusting so immodestly over a thousand feet in the air; no doubt he thought they mocked his passionate intensity. 
The World Trade Center towers don't have much poetry in them. It might be harder, psychologically, to bomb one of the old cathedrals of commerce like the Empire State or the Chrysler Building. Those seem to aspire beyond mammon. Belonging to a bygone era, they no longer challenge the world. The twin towers represent America as home of the unadorned Economic Man -- practical, rational, powerful, even brutal. They are the expression of an aspect of America our true-believing enemies have learned to hate and fear.
In striking at symbols, terrorists destroy the real lives of American working people, traumatize actual American children. We will learn to cope as other nations have; we are good at coping. Eventually few Americans will remember the country as it was before X-ray machines appeared at airports and in the vestibules of public buildings, before security guards were deployed at every other corporate door.
During the cold war, we lived in fear of nuclear holocaust. Now we know that if a nuclear device ever goes off in an American city it will likely have been assembled by a few people, perhaps in the guise of immigrants, in that safe house with a view of Lower Manhattan. These days, people are dying again for their national or religious identity. The new breed of terrorist may be those whose cause we have offended perhaps by simply being what we are.

HEADLINE: Tea Party Pure, With Idiosyncrasies

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
James Warren is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative
The heavens opened, thunder rang out and lightning flashed across the sky like in ''Twister'' or another meteorological disaster movie. All that was missing were airborne trees, rattling window shades and nervous children under beds.
The clatter was an apt preamble for a night with the convulsive surprise of American politics, the Tea Party. 
Joe Walsh, the Republican and Tea Party candidate in the north suburban Eighth Congressional District, last week pulled his campaign horse trailer up to a curiously fitting locale for insurrection, the Waukegan Yacht Club.
Forget your images of Ivy League graduates with Top-Siders, sipping gin. Waukegan's tonier times are long gone, the club is not the privileged sanctum of decades past, and immigration, poverty and the flight of businesses have reshaped the city.
And since Mr. Walsh was appearing before 20 members of the Waukegan City Club, he had what on the surface resembles the Tea Party core: middle-aged, middle-class white males with lots of doubts about a growing government and social change.
The nonpartisan club just wanted to hear Mr. Walsh, 48, a previously failed candidate who was the surprise winner of a six-way Republican primary. A campaign aide heralded him to me as ''the next Christine O'Donnell,'' a reference to the upset winner of the Republican primary for the United States Senate in Delaware.
A man who looks like a younger John Slattery, the actor portraying a hard-boozing and cynical ad executive on ''Mad Men,'' does possess idiosyncrasies. They include foreclosure on his condo in Evanston; tickets for driving without insurance; being way late with a federally mandated economic-disclosure statement; and being sued by a former campaign manager for money owed.
But there are no signs of O'Donnell-like past fidelity to witchcraft or suspicions about masturbation from Mr. Walsh, a Barrington native and Winnetka resident who has a master's degree in public policy from the University of Chicago and who has dabbled in private-equity financing.
''I feel like we're losing our country,'' he told the City Club members who were seated at tables around the bar.
Mr. Walsh delineated his policy positions, some of which have changed over the years, including those on abortion and guns. He's now against abortion and for concealed-carry gun laws.
He said he was ''a Tea Party conservative first, a Republican second,'' though it's hard to discern how he differs from a pro forma conservative.
He's an antispending diehard willing to eliminate the Departments of Energy and Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. He's against cap-and-trade environmental legislation, the new health care law and immigration overhaul.
He'd turn to a draft to bolster our armed forces and, he said, if Iran ''ever shot a missile into Kabul,'' he would be on it ''like a ton of bricks'' and obliterate the country in ''about a day,'' presumably via a nuclear weapon.
The most push-back he received was on altering Medicare and his aversion to compromise if he gets to Congress.
''There is nothing wrong in being the Party of No,'' he said to a dubious audience as he exhibited a central folly of the Tea Party: it sees virtually all compromise as treason.
Where Mr. Walsh seemed most realistic was about the financial realities of his own campaign.
Melissa Bean, the three-term Democrat incumbent in the district, not only has far more money, but the national Republican treasury is also exhibiting more largess toward three other suburban races, believing it can knock off Debbie Halvorson in the 11th Congressional District and Bill Foster in the 14th, both incumbent Democrats, and retain the seat of Mark Steven Kirk, the United States Senate candidate, in the 10th.
While the core of the Eighth District -- parts of Lake, Cook and McHenry Counties, including Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg and Palatine -- was long represented by Phil Crane, a conservative Republican, the moderate Ms. Bean is tacking even further to the right, as exemplified by a call to extend Bush-era tax cuts set to expire this year.
The United States Chamber of Commerce, unfettered in funneling money to bring down Democrats nationwide, is going easy on Ms. Bean, a friend of the banking industry.
Meanwhile, she appears to be running a bit scared and making many appearances, though declining to appear with Mr. Walsh.
That will change if polling shows him making inroads. Ms. Bean would then surely say yes to debating an apostle of no.
It may be that kind of year.

HEADLINE: The Future of California, Ready for Discussion

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is the editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Jonathan Weber writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
It's easy to be discouraged about the future of California, what with chronic political dysfunction, a depressed economy, deep social divisions and a political campaign season bringing out the worst in everyone. While the State Legislature sets a new record for failure -- a $19 billion deficit and still no budget some 90 days after the legal deadline -- the candidates for governor bicker over what Bill Clinton said about Jerry Brown 18 years ago and scream ''liar'' at each other as if they were in grade school. Sigh.
Yet as I gaze at a colorful new map that lays out four alternative futures for the state, I feel quite energized. The document is the first piece of an effort by two major University of California research centers and the Institute for the Future, based in Palo Alto, to reframe the public policy conversation. And for me, it succeeds in its effort to use imagination about the future as a way to grapple with the present. 
It's not that the scenarios themselves are particularly rosy. One envisions an ''enclave economy'' in which the wealthy parts of the state -- the Bay Area among them -- wall themselves off and hoard resources, letting hoi polloi in the hinterlands fend for themselves. (This scenario would most likely play out in the wake of a natural disaster.)
Nor do the situations all seem realistic. Another suggests that ''a sober-minded assessment of risks and resources in the face of water and energy shortages leads to a new focus on communities and commons.'' In this vision, Proposition 13 would be repealed, and investment would be directed to creative arts and community health rather than to personal consumption.
Even the ''smart state'' scenario, in which California leverages its technological prowess and invests in education to restart economic growth, has a big downside: greater income inequality. Only the least tangible scenario -- transformation led by social-network-based communities of interest that assume many governmental and business functions -- has something for everyone.
But as Marina Gorbis, executive director of the Institute for the Future, explained, the specific scenarios are not really the point. Rather, the goal is to ''outline the kinds of questions and dilemmas we need to be analyzing, and provoke people to ask deep questions.''
The map is structured in part as a game board, posing questions around large issues: health, education, food, work, water and energy, governance and equity, and migration. It then lists bullet points around each topic and invites people to offer their own solutions. The four big scenarios suggest broad outcomes based on the many specific decisions.
But how does this pondering get translated into action?
''The best way to influence the politicians is to educate and stimulate the thinking of the electorate,'' said Larry Smarr, director of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, an interdisciplinary institute that's part of both the University of California, San Diego, and the University of California, Irvine, and was a key collaborator on the project. (The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society, headquartered at Cal, was also involved.)
California, Mr. Smarr said, has ''locked itself into a very 20th-century way of looking at things,'' and this kind of exercise can help reframe the discussion.
Ms. Gorbis emphasizes that futurism is not about ivory-tower navel-gazing, but instead aims to engage people in shaping their lives and communities. Call me a wonk, but I found it extremely useful to have big issues organized in a way that made them seem tractable, while also showing their relationship to other societal forces.
The engagement piece is clearly the big challenge. Mr. Smarr and Ms. Gorbis both emphasized the potential of gaming platforms as an engagement tool. The map itself is just the starting point; it is meant to build a broad-based conversation, both online and in person.
The ways to prompt discussion are endless, if difficult. School-based initiatives that invite students to imagine among themselves? Flash-mobs that gather people for a quick think? Community forums, with sponsored food and cocktails to draw the crowd and lubricate the idea machine?
You can post your suggestions on this column at BayCitizen.org; together, maybe we can find some ways to kick-start a conversation about the future. If nothing else, it will be a welcome distraction from the present.

HEADLINE: AUG. 18, 1982: How to Think About Detente

BYLINE: By RICHARD M. NIXON. 
RICHARD M. NIXON was the 37th president. He died in 1994.

 BODY:
To many Americans, detente has become a dirty word, virtually synonymous with appeasement. To most Europeans, it is a good word. To them it describes a period in the early and middle 1970s when tensions between East and West were lessened and when there was more trade, more contact, some liberalization in Eastern Europe and, above all, a reduced danger of nuclear war. 
American critics of detente, by contrast, look with horror at all the Soviet advances of the last decade. They argue, correctly, that the Soviet leaders lie, cheat and steal and are out to impose their oppressive regime on the whole world, and from this they conclude that the only safe course is to restore United States nuclear superiority, cut back contacts and attempt to strangle the Soviet Union economically.
This argument misses the point of detente, misreads history and would deprive the West of some of our most potent weapons in the East-West struggle.
The more we retreat into an angry cold-war confrontation, the more we reduce the competition to those levels on which the Soviet Union is strongest. The one thing the Kremlin is good at is wielding raw power, through military might and terror tactics. Where the contest is waged on that ground, Moscow has the advantage. Where we shift it to other grounds, we have the advantage.
Detente is a means of broadening the competition: expanding contacts, opening the way to Western ideas and Western influence, weaving a web of economic interdependencies that raise the cost to the Soviet Union of stepping beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior. Those critics who would have us scuttle detente and return to narrow confrontation are urging a form of unilateral disarmament: They would deprive us of many of our most effective diplomatic weapons.
We can call this peaceful competition. We can call it waging a struggle by nonmilitary means. We can call it detente. Whatever we call it, it is better than the alternatives of either sterile confrontation or nuclear conflict.

HEADLINE: THE '00S; Wall Street's Fatal Blind Spot:

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS and DAVID EINHORN. 
MICHAEL LEWIS is the author of ''The Big Short.'' DAVID EINHORN is the author of ''Fooling Some of the People All of the Time.''

 BODY:
Jan. 4, 2009
AMERICANS enter the New Year in a strange new role: financial lunatics. We've been viewed by the wider world with mistrust and suspicion on other matters, but on the subject of money even our harshest critics have been inclined to believe that we knew what we were doing. They watched our investment bankers and emulated them: for a long time now half the planet's college graduates seemed to want nothing more out of life than a job on Wall Street.
This is one reason the collapse of our financial system has inspired not merely a national but a global crisis of confidence. Good God, the world seems to be saying, if they don't know what they are doing with money, who does? 
Incredibly, intelligent people the world over remain willing to lend us money and even listen to our advice; they appear not to have realized the full extent of our madness. We have at least a brief chance to cure ourselves. But first we need to ask: of what?
To that end consider the strange story of Harry Markopolos. Mr. Markopolos is the former investment officer with Rampart Investment Management in Boston who, for nine years, tried to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bernard L. Madoff couldn't be anything other than a fraud. Mr. Madoff's investment performance, given his stated strategy, was not merely improbable but mathematically impossible. And so, Mr. Markopolos reasoned, Bernard Madoff must be doing something other than what he said he was doing.
In his devastatingly persuasive 17-page letter to the S.E.C., Mr. Markopolos saw two possible scenarios. In the ''unlikely'' scenario: Mr. Madoff, who acted as a broker as well as an investor, was ''front-running'' his brokerage customers. A customer might submit an order to Madoff Securities to buy shares in I.B.M. at a certain price, for example, and Madoff Securities would instantly buy I.B.M. shares for its own portfolio ahead of the customer order. If I.B.M.'s shares rose, Mr. Madoff kept them; if they fell he fobbed them off onto the poor customer.
In the ''highly likely'' scenario, wrote Mr. Markopolos, ''Madoff Securities is the world's largest Ponzi scheme.'' Which, as we now know, it was.
Harry Markopolos sent his report to the S.E.C. on Nov. 7, 2005 -- more than three years before Mr. Madoff was finally exposed -- but he had been trying to explain the fraud to them since 1999. He had no direct financial interest in exposing Mr. Madoff. He wasn't an unhappy investor or a disgruntled employee. There was no way to short shares in Madoff Securities, and so Mr. Markopolos could not have made money directly from Mr. Madoff's failure.
To judge from his letter, Harry Markopolos anticipated mainly downsides for himself: he declined to put his name on it for fear of what might happen to him and his family if anyone found out he had written it. And yet the S.E.C.'s cursory investigation of Mr. Madoff pronounced him free of fraud.
What's interesting about the Madoff scandal, in retrospect, is how little interest anyone inside the financial system had in exposing it. It wasn't just Harry Markopolos who smelled a rat. As Mr. Markopolos explained in his letter, Goldman Sachs was refusing to do business with Mr. Madoff; many others doubted Mr. Madoff's profits or assumed he was front-running his customers and steered clear of him.
Between the lines, Mr. Markopolos hinted that even some of Mr. Madoff's investors may have suspected that they were the beneficiaries of a scam. After all, it wasn't all that hard to see that the profits were too good to be true. Some of Mr. Madoff's investors may have reasoned that the worst that could happen to them, if the authorities put a stop to the front-running, was that a good thing would come to an end.
The Madoff scandal echoes a deeper absence inside our financial system, which has been undermined not merely by bad behavior but by the lack of checks and balances to discourage it. ''Greed'' doesn't cut it as a satisfying explanation for the current financial crisis. Greed was necessary but insufficient; in any case, we are as likely to eliminate greed from our national character as we are lust and envy. The fixable problem isn't the greed of the few but the misaligned interests of the many.

HEADLINE: Dec. 4, 1970: A Righteous America?

BYLINE: By REINHOLD NIEBUHR. 
REINHOLD NIEBUHR was a theologian. He died in 1971.

 BODY:
Our record as a righteous nation has proved so filled with error that, obviously, we must stop thanking God we are not like other nations. This humility will not solve the multiple problems that confront our nation, once infant and comparatively innocent, but now a nuclear super-nation. 
Our chief foreign problem is to avoid a nuclear catastrophe while wrestling with the other super-nation on the edge of the abyss of mutual annihilation. Our domestic problems threaten to destroy the erstwhile haven of democratic serenity. The chief problem is the still unsolved issue of destroying the last remnants of slavery: the murderous bitterness of the Negro youth, of which two-thirds, lacking technical education, are unemployed in our increasingly industrial civilization.
Perhaps the most perplexing problem is the ecological one of rendering modern urban, industrial society fit for human beings, not poisoned by polluted air and water. Our overwhelming problems must finally convince us that the childish illusions of our infant days have come to an end.

HEADLINE: Stalled At the Rental Car Counter

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL. 
E-mail: haggler@nytimes.com Keep it brief and family-friendly, and go easy on the caps-lock key. Letters may be edited for clarity and length.

 BODY:
AND now, rental car hassles.
Over the years, the Haggler has collected his share of unhappy tales in this hoariest of genres, though his principal beef with rental car companies isn't their mistakes. It's their standard business practices.
Like the gas-tank bingo that agencies force you to play, with different options to refuel your vehicle -- prepay, postpay, post-prepay, pre-postpay. It's like a TV game show, except what's behind door No. 2 isn't a shiny home appliance and some Turtle Wax. It's a few gallons of unleaded that cost $25. 
Then there's insurance-plan roulette. First, agents may imply that coverage you already have won't help if you so much as graze the bumper of your vehicle. Second, they suggest that if you buy enough insurance, you can bring back the shredded, post-collision remains of the car in a Glad bag, and nobody will even ask what happened.
So, you can risk personal bankruptcy, or you can drive with joyful abandon. Your call.
But enough about the Haggler's complaints. Here are two of yours.
Q. In August, the Budget counter at the Salt Lake City airport kept me and my family waiting for an hour for a car. As an apology, we were given a free GPS. This seemed like a nice gesture, except that A) the device didn't work, and we had to swap it for another one, delaying our trip by another 30 minutes and B) it wasn't actually free. It showed up on our bill -- $170, plus tax.
When I called to get that charge removed, I spent about four hours over the course of three weeks talking to different employees in an unsuccessful attempt to speak to ''the manager,'' who was the only person who could help.
Finally, I called and refused to hang up until the manager picked up the phone. But when she credited the cost of the GPS, she neglected to include the tax, which, given the absurd number of levies and surcharges at the airport, amounted to roughly $50.
I can't take another four hours of hold time and evasion. Could you give it a shot?
Brigitte Madrian
Wellesley, Mass.
A. We'll begin our answer by posing a question: Is it that hard for rental-car managers to dial a phone?
The Haggler pondered this one a few weeks ago after leaving two messages on two different answering machines at the Park Plaza branch of Hertz in Boston, in a vain attempt to retrieve some property that the Haggler had left in a Hertz car. Only when the Haggler called Hertz's public relations manager at corporate headquarters did he get a response.
The Haggler was genuinely curious -- what went wrong here? After the spokesman looked into the matter, he reported that this particular branch is tiny and that the person assigned to listen to the branch's messages was off that week. Those duties weren't picked up by anyone else.
Seriously, people -- if the American economy is relying more and more on the service sector, why isn't our service sector magnificently efficient? Why isn't it at least good enough to return a call?
Now, we address the problem of Ms. Madrian, who, by the way, is an economist at Harvard. Budget's corporate office said that the Salt Lake City airport branch was an independent franchisee. The general manager is Jack Lehr, who called last week to apologize.
''Today is the first I heard of this problem,'' he said, sounding genuinely mortified. (Yes, the general manager is not to be confused with ''the manager.'') He promptly wrote to Ms. Madrian, offering both a refund of the taxes she was inappropriately charged and a discount if she ever gave the Salt Lake City Budget another chance.
''Later today, I'm going to have a conversation with my employee,'' Mr. Lehr said, ''and explain that this is a totally unacceptable way to treat customers.''
Q. At a Thrifty location in Billings, Mont., I declined all add-on insurances on a five-day rental. When we returned the car, my wife, who made the reservation, happened to note that a charge of $4.99 per day, labeled ''Trip Saver,'' had been added for each of the five days. She asked why and was told by the sales agent: ''Corporate instructed us to add this item to every billing. All locations are required to do it now.''
The fee, we learned, provided insurance in case a key was lost or a customer had problems on the road. My wife asked that the charge be removed, but the agent said that only the location manager could do that. Two days later, when my wife spoke to the manager by phone, she was told that it was against company policy to remove such charges, but ''this one time I'll waive it.''
We're talking about a small sum of money here, but I'm guessing that it adds up quickly.
Don Pierce
Greenville, S.C.
A. The Haggler contacted Anna Cook, a spokeswoman for Thrifty, who spent two days trying to research Mr. Pierce's transaction, with little apparent success. The complication, if that is the right word, is that Mr. Pierce rented from a Thrifty licensee, the Lewis Transportation Group, and communication between Thrifty headquarters and Lewis could charitably be described as not speedy.
When the Haggler asked to contact the Lewis Transportation Group directly, Ms. Cook offered a phone number that turned out to be disconnected. When the Haggler relayed that fact to Ms. Cook, she was surprised, which means that she hadn't tried calling Lewis when her e-mail went unanswered.
Wow. At any rate, Ms. Cook did say that it was certainly not Thrifty's policy to charge customers for insurance that they had declined. And that, sadly, will have to do.
The Haggler was hoping for some words of contrition or ''We solemnly vow that this won't happen again,'' or even ''Whoops.'' But the Haggler lives in the real world, a place where endings are not always very satisfying.
And now, another Haggler request:
Send your tales about mattress purchases gone wrong. Make sure that the episode is relatively recent, and keep the story succinct -- eight sentences should do it.

HEADLINE: Artists in Residence

BYLINE: By LINDA YABLONSKY

 BODY:
Rome has nothing on Detroit. The industrial ruins in this American city are at least as spectacular, and largely unmatched in scale anywhere in the United States. They are also fertile ground for a growing number of artists like Scott Hocking, who find inspiration in the tatters. To make his large-format photographs, Hocking has built anomalous sculptures in two ghostly auto plants, Fisher Body and Packard, both designed by Detroit's leading industrial architect, Albert Kahn.
Last winter Hocking stole onto the Packard's grounds, now so devastated they suggest the aftermath of an earthquake, and installed junked TVs atop fluted columns that had supported the roof of one building. Standing on hilly terrain that was once the level top floor, we could see the unblemished 1963 Mies van der Rohe apartment towers in Lafayette Park across town. The juxtaposition of a living civilization against its vast remains was so disquieting I couldn't speak. 
Today Detroit, home of the American automobile industry and a once-mighty symbol of enterprise and ingenuity, is a city of haunting contradictions. Spread over roughly 140 square miles, it has a business district that resembles a ghost town: it is not unusual to spot wild dogs on downtown streets, pheasants in backyards or tumbleweeds rolling down sidewalks. There are an estimated 33,000 empty houses and 91,000 vacant lots, many of which sit cheek by jowl with pristine Art Deco skyscrapers, glorious estates and freshly painted single-family homes.
All of it packs a visual wallop, which is one reason this failed metropolis has become such a magnet for contemporary artists, who include important figures like Matthew Barney and the Detroit-born Mike Kelley as well as rising stars like Cyprien Gaillard and Jordan Wolfson.
For his show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (Mocad), Kelley will drive a mobile re-creation of his childhood home from the museum through downtown slums to his family's western suburb, stopping at the Henry Ford museum; it will then be parked permanently as a community center at Mocad, an avant-garde showcase at a former car dealership. ''My hope is that along this route some kind of 'social services' are performed using the structure,'' he said. ''Something along the lines of a bloodmobile or Meals on Wheels.'' Kelley, now based in L.A., is joining a community that is reshaping the city as no outsider could. Where visitors see a corpse, these activists see a phoenix; the derelict homes that are shorthand for the faltering economy present opportunities. ''There's something about the desolation that makes it easier to do something different,'' said Levon Millross, a performance artist and member of the cultural underground who wears a shoulder-pad assemblage he made from Styrofoam, electronic hardware, keys and gooseneck tubing. ''And it's empowering.''
Attracted by cheap space and driven by a sense of civic responsibility, young artists are turning crumbling homes into art centers, converting factories into studio and exhibition spaces, and planting community gardens as artworks. As the 25-year-old Kate Daughdrill put it, for her generation Detroit is no city on the skids but ''a theater of engagement.''
Of course, artists in other depressed cities have rejuvenated decrepit neighborhoods before, only to be exiled by gentrification to even more unsavory locations, where the cycle repeats. But with crime rates soaring and some officials estimating unemployment to be as high as 50 percent, that's not likely to happen here anytime soon. Meanwhile, Detroiters might welcome more amenities like the Cass Cafe, a wallet-friendly hangout near the Wayne State University campus.
''I hope we're battling gentrification,'' said Daughdrill, co-founder of a monthly benefit dinner called Soup that supplies micro-grants for creative projects. When we spoke, Daughdrill was working on a project at the Russell Industrial Center, a complex of former auto-body factories that offers cut-rate space to a gallery called Cave, a glass-blowing factory, a pole-dancing exercise studio and a coppersmith, among others.
Kathy Leisen, 32, took over two empty plots in her North Corktown neighborhood, northwest of the city center, and created the Lot, an outdoor art space with site-specific projects. In Highland Park, an impoverished, predominantly black neighborhood, an art collective painted 16 derelict homes orange to make them visible from expressways to northern suburbs, where much of the city's white population first fled after the 1967 riots.
The impresario of such guerrilla art in Detroit is Tyree Guyton, who started painting polka dots and mystical circles on the vacant houses in the McDougall-Hunt area 25 years ago. He also filled the empty lots between the houses with stuffed animals, salvaged furniture and upright car hoods bearing the imprint of primitive masks. A trained artist with a metaphysical bent, the 54-year-old Guyton says he put ''the face of God in the 'hood.'' Now an unofficial landmark maintained by his nonprofit Heidelberg Project, the original site draws 275,000 visitors a year. Next he plans to suspend vintage cars from the facade of Brewster-Douglas Projects, the abandoned housing complex where Diana Ross grew up. ''What's made me successful is my faith,'' Guyton said. ''I created an audience and tapped into something bigger than all of us.''
On the border of Hamtramck, a largely Polish-Bangladeshi municipality, the artist Mitch Cope and the architect Gina Reichert have made real estate development a primary medium for their own socially conscious art. Working from a modest home in a former grocery store, they have bought or facilitated the sale of 10 neighborhood houses to other artists and curators from Detroit, Chicago and Europe. One was a $100 tear-down partly destroyed by two arson attempts.
The couple's most ambitious project is the Power House, which they conceived as a design lab for artists and architects. This summer, they organized groups from San Francisco and the Netherlands to prepare the house for solar power and rebuilt the interior, using Detroit's abundant scrap materials. ''The house is meant to be a public space and an experiment in what can be done off the grid,'' Cope said. ''There is too much opportunity here. You can be consumed by it. But it's a malleable city, and you can change and improve it.''
Though the city is broke and many of its art collectors stay cloistered in wealthy suburbs, there is some institutional support. Last year the Michigan-based Kresge Foundation created a program that awards $25,000 grants to artists who work in the Detroit area. And this year, the local McGregor Fund began supporting the four-year-old Mocad. Luis Croquer, its director, has attracted financing from private individuals and foundations, mounted an ambitious program of American and European art, and scheduled musical performances, readings and symposia that have made Mocad the community's social hub.
''We're an audience builder, a think tank, a point of access to the world,'' said Croquer, who admits it's not easy to get people from the suburbs to go downtown. ''I think people are unprepared for the changes that are coming.''
One person who is banking on it is the dealer George N'Namdi. Last fall he opened an 8,000-square-foot space in the midtown Cultural District, where he shows international artists of color. ''The energy is in the city,'' said N'Namdi, whose gallery is one of the oldest in the country owned by an African-American. Many of his artists live and work nearby, in mixed-race neighborhoods like the Eastern Market area northeast of the city center, and in Corktown, home of the former Michigan Central Station, a 18-story Beaux-Arts relic that is Detroit's reigning symbol of decay.
Nearly all the other galleries are in the suburbs, anchored by the ultracool Susanne Hilberry Gallery. And more are starting to come. Monica Bowman, 33, opened the Butcher's Daughter in an office space in Ferndale a year ago. ''I saw people on the ground desperate to change things, and I saw I could make an impact,'' said Bowman, who hopes to connect the city's emerging art scene with deep-pocketed collectors nearby. ''It sounds evangelical, but, well, you have to believe before you can do anything. The issue is how to get people with disposable income to spend it on art instead of cars.''
Cars are partly what drew Matthew Barney to the city: one is the star of ''KHU,'' the second installment of his projected seven-part epic, to be presented next month as a five-hour journey on the Detroit River. The Motor City also resonates with Barney because of his obsession with Harry Houdini, who died here after a performance.
Though many in the baby-boomer generation are skeptical that the young idealists can sustain even the most promising projects without developing a new class of collectors to support them, they have made a commitment to Detroit that seems unshakable. ''It's a hard city to understand,'' said Julie Taubman, a founding member of Mocad who has taken thousands of photographs of the city. ''I think it's the most visually compelling place on the planet. If you have a sense of adventure and curiosity, there's no place like this.''

HEADLINE: Oct. 21, 1987: Black Monday: A Warning, an Opportunity

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE H. SUMMERS. 
Lawrence H. Summers is the director of the National Economic Council.

 BODY:
The market meltdown does not presage another depression. With suitable policy responses, it need not even signal a significant decline in the economy.
Thoughtful observers have been saying for some time that the market was at unsustainably high levels. The real value of stock market wealth has declined only to its level in the summer of 1986. There is no reason this should lead to a large decline in consumption or investment. 
Right now, panic can force us to take the measures that prudence has demanded for a long time.
Sustainable federal budget policies are a necessity if financial markets are to remain calm in coming years. This means a concerted and sincere effort to eliminate the budget deficit.
Since other nations will not forever trade real goods and services in return for American paper, the dollar will eventually fall to a point where we can balance our books. Pretending otherwise creates uncertainty about when the day of reckoning will come. As long as the dollar is greatly overvalued, as it is now, foreign investors will necessarily be jittery about investing their money in the United States, and the possibility of panic will remain.
There's also an urgent need for the elimination of market institutions and trading practices that promote excess volatility. The stock index futures market should be regulated out of existence. The futures market circumvents margin requirements by enabling investors to have effective ownership of more than $150,000 of stock while putting down only $6,500. It makes possible trading strategies like portfolio insurance that increase market volatility by creating huge selling pressure after market declines. At the same time, the futures market offers no new opportunities to stable investors seeking to invest for the long term.
There's an old saying: The first time, the blame is yours; the second time, the blame is mine. No one could have anticipated Monday's market meltdown. But if it happens again, we should blame poor economic policies.

HEADLINE: Q&A

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
A Repair Needed by Next Summer
QThe air-conditioners in our co-op building are installed in sleeves in the wall beneath windows. The sleeve in my apartment was rotted and needed to be replaced. The board decided that it was my responsibility. Is this correct? 
A Lior Aldad, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that according to most proprietary leases, the equipment, fixtures and appliances installed by the shareholders should be maintained and repaired by the shareholders; walls and window frames, meanwhile, are the co-op's responsibility. ''Although air-conditioning wall units are typically installed inside metal sleeves that are secured to the building's wall,'' Mr. Aldad said, ''it is not always clear whether the sleeve itself is part of the structure.'' So unless the issue is addressed in the lease, it is up to the board to determine who is responsible.
Making a Case for 'Interest Only'
QWe own a co-op in a large development in Queens. It has bothered us that the mortgages on the properties in the development are ''interest only'' mortgages. We were told that this is common in large co-ops. Is that so?
A Robert Grant, the director of Midboro Management in Manhattan, says that about a third of the co-op buildings his firm manages have interest-only underlying mortgages. It is typical when a co-op refinances, he said, to borrow enough to cover all closing costs and even build up the reserve fund. ''The benefit of an interest-only mortgage is to have the lowest monthly payment during the term of that loan,'' Mr. Grant said. He notes that such loans are sensitive to rate changes: if rates are higher when the current mortgage has to be refinanced, and the principal of that mortgage has not been reduced, the monthly payment may very well go up.
Condo Owners Cover for Lapses of Others
QOver a year ago our condominium board imposed a monthly ''special assessment'' to cover losses incurred because some owners had failed to pay their monthly common charges. Can a condo board impose an assessment that has no time limit?
A Andrew Brucker, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer, says that although it is common for assessments to be for a short or specific period of time, there is nothing in the condo law or in typical condo bylaws that would prevent a board from passing an assessment that continues for an indefinite period.
Capital-Gains Taxes for Married Couples
QMy wife and I owned and lived in our last home for 10 years. We built a new home and took occupancy in February 2009. We sold our old house six months later. Will the gain on the old house be subject to taxes?
A Martin Shenkman, a tax lawyer with offices in Manhattan and Paramus, N.J., says that an individual taxpayer can exclude from income up to $250,000 of the gain from the sale of a home owned and used by the taxpayer as a principal residence for at least two of the five years before the sale. (The exclusion is $500,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.) So if the couple occupied the old house from the time of purchase until they moved into the new place, it appears they will qualify for the exclusion.

HEADLINE: SEPT. 28, 1972: Winning Vietnam

BYLINE: By JOHN S. McCAIN Jr.. 
JOHN S. MCCAIN JR. was the chief of United States Pacific forces from 1968 to 1972. He died in 1981.

 BODY:
The United States forces have fulfilled their role in supporting the South Vietnamese in a superb manner. Particularly noteworthy and effective have been the United States air operations against the invading enemy forces. 
The B-52's, naval surface ship gunfire, the Air Force and Navy tactical support aircraft, the gunships and air transports working round the clock in conjunction with the growing Vietnamese Air Force -- all contributed a decisive role in beating the enemy invaders in Kontum, An Loc and now in Quangtri. This United States naval and air power has assisted the South Vietnamese ground forces in taking the initiative on the battlefields against a highly mobile invading force of superior numbers and sophisticated firepower.
Looking to the future, the strength of our United States air and naval forces in Southeast Asia will depend on the political actions taken to resolve the conflict, and on the enemy's military actions. I am convinced the months immediately ahead are critical for the preservation of all that the United States and allied forces have achieved thus far in Indochina.
Our ultimate goal in the Pacific is the encouragement of strong, viable economies and the right of self-determination for all the peoples of the region. I have no doubt that our assistance will be required and will be forthcoming in Asia in the years ahead. It is absolutely essential for the stability of the free world that the United States remain a Pacific power.

HEADLINE: The End of Tenure?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''It's easy to gin up anger against elites,'' Christopher Shea writes (''The End of Tenure?'' Sept. 5). He conjures a caricature, based on current commentary, of pitchfork-wielding citizens outraged over professors who squander resources to produce ''research'' instead of teaching. To illustrate, he tosses out some project titles whose illegitimacy is presumed self-evident. Shea claims this all-too-common depiction of a pampered professoriate is not ''entirely false.'' Perhaps, but it certainly yields false impressions.
Readers might be interested to know that the title of one of his targets, ''Rednecks, Queers and Country Music,'' belongs to an actual course offered in the women's studies department at the University of Michigan, and that the workings of social inequality and cultural elitism constitute its primary focus. Moreover, Nadine Hubbs, the tenured professor who teaches (and grades) the course, created it on the basis of her cutting-edge original research. 
ELIZABETH R. COLE Ann Arbor, Mich. The writer is a professor and chairwoman of the women's studies department at the University of Michigan.
To the Editor:
Christopher Shea complains that colleges are becoming engines of inequality, as the wealth and resources of different colleges and universities diverge. This misses the noteworthy shift over the past several decades on the part of the wealthier institutions to allocate their coveted spots by academic talent and not by family income, spending significant amounts on financial aid.
Just when first-generation college students and children of low-income families can make it to the Ivies and the elite liberal arts colleges, and all the opportunities this opens up for them, we start questioning the allocation of resources at these schools? The solution to the haves and have-nots in American higher education is not to make every college and university a have-not, but to increase our society's commitment to higher education and reverse the gutting of our public universities.
CATHARINE HILL Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The writer is president of Vassar College.
To the Editor:
Christopher Shea fails to mention the very reason tenure was created in the first place: the protection of intellectual freedom. Rather than granting a life of indolence, tenure offers serious scholars the guarantee that their research will not jeopardize their careers.
Who is going to defend scholars of, say, imperialism, labor rights or Islam from critics who, for purely political reasons, deem their teaching and research unpatriotic or un-American? Right-wing organizations that monitor academia would love to see the end of tenure.
Ironically, abolishing tenure would drive many more scholars -- not fewer -- to work on arcane, apolitical subjects. And it would motivate professors, fearing for their jobs, to shy away from engaged debate about important issues in the classroom. What is the payoff?
J. P. DAUGHTON Stanford, Calif. The writer is an associate professor of history at Stanford University.
To the Editor:
Overpaid and underworked faculty are not the cause of escalating college costs. The problem is that parents are willing to pay top dollar to get their children into the top universities -- in other words, the universities that recruit expensive faculty stars. The universities don't hire these faculty members to teach, but to have them around. That graduate students and adjuncts do much of the actual teaching is simply an economy measure made necessary by this practice. And that many of the faculty stars publish useless palaver is the fault of a society, itself largely a product of the university system, that ignores what these professors are actually saying. None of this will change until someone notices that the brand name on a diploma promises nothing about a graduate's qualifications for a job.
DAVID G. TUERCK Boston The writer is a professor and chairman of the economics department at Suffolk University.

HEADLINE: Running for Mayor Without the Machine's Muscle

BYLINE: By DANIEL LIBIT. 
Dan Mihalopoulos contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As Rahm Emanuel and a host of others consider campaigns to replace Mayor Richard M. Daley, they must reckon with a key issue: how to mount a successful citywide effort without the political machine that propelled Mr. Daley successfully through six mayoral elections.
For Mr. Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, it may be especially important. Not only did Mr. Daley endorse him in his campaign for Congress in 2002, but he also gave Mr. Emanuel the full support of his army of patronage employees, who knocked on doors up and down the 5th Congressional district. This time, political experts said, Mr. Emanuel will not be able to count on that kind of help.
''The days of Saturday mornings with 300 truck drivers taking marching orders and going into precincts -- I think those are long over,'' said Mike Noonan, a Democratic strategist who has managed campaigns for Lisa Madigan, the attorney general, and Todd Stroger, the Cook County Board president. ''It is important to remember that was happening in the 2002 primary, when Rahm was running.''
At the time, Mr. Daley found himself at the apex of his political power. The economy was booming, and a jury was four years away from convicting his patronage chief, Robert Sorich, for his role in a city hiring-fraud scandal. 
That verdict was portrayed as a fatal blow to the machine, but the mayor still managed to win his last election, in 2007, with the vestiges of the apparatus built on the longstanding practice of promising city jobs in exchange for campaign work.
In that election, Mr. Daley also enjoyed substantial financial support from business leaders he had cultivated over the years. As usual, he also benefited from the absence of a serious challenger.
Some political analysts estimate that a successful candidate in next year's mayoral election will need $4 million to $6 million. Others are not so sure. ''I think the money is critical but not a definitive as to who is going to win and lose,'' Mr. Noonan said.
Peter Thompson, Mr. Daley's nephew and chief fund-raiser for his 2007 campaign, said mayoral candidates should not fixate on raising a specific dollar amount. What is more important, he said, is how much candidates can raise compared with their opponents.
''When you are in the woods in Montana, and a bear is chasing you, you don't have to be faster than the bear -- you just have to be faster than your friend who also is trying to outrun the bear,'' Mr. Thompson said.
Kitty Kurth, a Democratic consultant who is currently advising Stephanie Neely, the city treasurer, on her re-election, said: ''There hasn't been a real open election for so long, I think that many of the rules are going to be different, and all of the conventional wisdom, you should take it and throw it out the window.''
Further complicating matters is a $10,000 limit on donations from corporations and unions that will take effect on Jan. 1.
Some observers expect that the deadline will set off a mad dash to raise money before the first of the year. But, in a down economy and with a large mayoral field, corporate donors might be disinclined to commit money to candidates until the race narrows.
''It is a little game of chicken between candidates and donors,'' said Thomas Bowen, a veteran Democratic operative who is managing the campaign of Forrest Claypool, a Cook County commissioner who is running for county assessor.
''I think business leaders are frequently cautious donors who are less likely to take a chance on an unknown quantity,'' Ms. Kurth said. ''They gave Daley money all the time because they knew him, and quite honestly because they were threatened a little bit. But trying to get them to invest in a new mayoral product is going to be pretty tough.''
So far, only a few potential candidates -- Mr. Emanuel, who presumably could exploit his national Democratic connections, and Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, who possibly could tap Latino donors around the country -- show a likely ability to raise significant money outside Chicago.
''By February, I think it is going to be even harder,'' Ms. Kurth said. ''We'll have just finished the November election where people will be pretty tapped out anyway. Mayor Daley was able to essentially strong-arm his donors to give money so he could keep things at status quo, and nobody can make that promise now.''
Local unions have also written large checks in the past, and have recently shown a willingness to do so still. In 2007, the Service Employees International Union spent $2.5 million on the Chicago City Council elections.
''Right now, S.E.I.U. has demonstrated the ability to spend millions of dollars in aldermanic races; the business community has not,'' said Greg Goldner, a Democratic consultant who ran Mr. Emanuel's Congressional campaign in 2002.
But Mr. Allen thinks labor unions, like big business, will wait until the mayoral field narrows before opening their wallets.
''If there are a number of candidates and several of them are friendly to labor and respect labor's issues,'' he said, ''I don't know if they are going to get involved too heavily until it is really Door No. 1 or Door No. 2.''
Jorge Ramirez, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, said he expected labor to act in ''lock step.''
''There is a sense of occasion with folks in the labor community to understand that this is an opportunity to elevate issues and discussion, and they are going to seize that opportunity,'' Mr. Ramirez said.
But he added that his organization would be largely focused on the race for governor until November.
Aside from the issue of money, there is the calculus of manpower, as candidates figure out how to find their foot soldiers and how to best put them to use.
For so many years, the ground game has been the bailiwick of the old guard: Democratic organizations, unions and Mr. Daley's patronage armies. Now, as happens in other cities not dominated by machine politics, people working to get votes in the wards will have to be volunteers sufficiently motivated to use their time and effort for a candidate.
''The influence of the traditional precinct organization has been on the decline for 10 years, not to mention that in a bad economy, people are a little anti-authoritative right now anyway,'' Mr. Bowen said.
This campaign, he added, ''is more of an opportunity to build new organizations than to measure some of the old ones.''
With expectations of a high voter turnout, some observers are uncertain whether a door-to-door operation is necessary for a candidate's success.
But the former alderman William Banks, who heads the 36th Ward Regular Democratic Organization, said he believed that, despite the shifting political landscape, foot soldiers would remain crucial.
''I have been a committeeman for 31 years,'' Mr. Banks said, ''and I wouldn't trade my membership for the world.''
He acknowledged, however, that it was increasingly difficult to fill his roster with effective volunteers.
Mr. Allen agreed. ''If people were energized behind a particular candidate, you will get people to volunteer and help,'' he said. But with a completely open seat with no incumbent, it is hard to get a grass roots, populist ''surge of people behind one person.''

HEADLINE: Eastern Promises

BYLINE: By MONICA KHEMSUROV

 BODY:
When David Lynch and Frank Gehry made headlines last year for their involvement in two multimillion-dollar cultural centers in the economically downtrodden city of Lodz, Poland, confusion ran high. What could they possibly see in the so-called Manchester of Poland? In fact, Lodz is undergoing something of a creative rebirth. The city has begun turning its 19th-century textile buildings into new-economy hubs -- a case in point is the Manufaktura complex 1 (Ogrodowa Street; manufaktura.com), home to a museum and the city's first upscale design hotel, Andel's 2 . (andelslodz.com). Lodz is also financing cultural festivals and programs aimed at retaining local art school grads, and once a planned high-speed rail slashes the Warsaw commute to 35 minutes, they'll have one more reason to stay put. 
ART In 1931, Wladyslaw Strzeminski and his circle of Polish avant-gardists founded the Muzeum Sztuki (Wieckowskiego 36; msl.org.pl) -- the world's second modern-art institution, after MoMA. It now puts on shows of recent work (its permanent collection is at Manufaktura), including next month's survey of the painter Zbigniew Rogalski. The original building includes the Mondrian-inspired Neoplastic Room and the futuristic-looking MS Cafe, designed in 2008 by the local architects Wunderteam. The Fokus Lodz Biennial (biennalelodz.pl), curated in part by the local art legend Ryszard Wasko, will fill the rest of the city's public art spaces until mid-October. For contemporary Polish art year-round, there's Atlas Sztuki (Piotrkowska 114; atlassztuki.pl), a white-box gallery in a former Jewish meat market.
FILM Since filming parts of ''Inland Empire'' in Lodz, David Lynch has spearheaded a plan for a new cultural center bearing his name at the old EC1 power station. The other film hub, the Frank Gehry-designed Camerimage Center, is currently stalled -- you can buy a pair of EC1 jeans to support the cause -- but the city's cinematic legacy is always close at hand. The Lodz Filmowa project (lodzfilmcommission.pl) shows movies shot in the city at the actual filming location.
FASHION AND DESIGN Though Lodz's art academy has the best fashion school in the country (Polish fashion week is here), its graduates usually relocate to Warsaw. And that was the only place you could buy their clothes until the Arkana Concept Store 3 (Wieckowskiego 18; arkanlodz.pl) opened in Lodz last fall, stocking pieces by the likes of Justyna Chrabelska and Sylwester Krupinski. This October, fashion week overlaps with the fourth annual Lodz Design festival (lodzdesign.com); one of its curators is the Wroclaw-based rising star Oskar Zieta, whose inflated metal stools look like Mylar balloons. The Lodz Art Center 4 (lodzartcenter.com), which is currently helping to turn an empty factory into a studio facility called the Art Inkubator, is producing the festival. Other local work is for sale at Fruits and Vegetables (Traugutta 9), a new cafe that also holds group discussions led by architects and writers. MONICA KHEMSUROV

HEADLINE: China Imposes A Steep Tariff On U.S. Poultry

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Days after it flexed its economic muscle in a diplomatic dispute with Japan, China continued to display a more assertive international economic policy on Sunday as it imposed steep tariffs on poultry imports from the United States.
China's commerce ministry announced on its Web site that it would impose import tariffs on American poultry of up to 105.4 percent. It said the tariffs reflected the result of its own antidumping investigation, which looked at whether the United States was harming China's poultry industry by exporting chicken parts for less than it cost to produce them. 
The commerce ministry started the investigation less than two days after President Obama imposed steep tariffs on Chinese tires a year ago. Chinese officials have denied that the inquiry was in retaliation, but poultry is one of the few categories in which the United States runs a trade surplus with China, making it an ideal target for Chinese trade actions.
The tariffs are another example of China's willingness to use its economic leverage when it feels it is being challenged. An official at one of Japan's top traders in rare earth minerals said on Monday that there appeared to be no resumption in shipments to Japan, a result of a still-simmering dispute over Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said traders were watching closely to see whether Chinese customs would start letting shipments through again. ''China's rising assertiveness on the international economic stage reflects its growing economic might and the self-confidence of its leadership, but is tempered by the realization that it faces many challenges in terms of its own development,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell.
Carol J. Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, said, ''We are disappointed that duties are to be imposed and will be examining the determination for consistency with applicable rules.''
Quarrels over products as diverse as chickens and rare earth minerals might seem like minor spats. But they come against the backdrop of China's vigorous defense of its currency policy, and its stepped-up activity in the World Trade Organization.
China broke the peg of its currency, the renminbi, to the dollar in June but has permitted it to appreciate less than 2 percent against the dollar since then. In recent weeks, Chinese state media have criticized the United States for pressuring China to reduce its intervention in currency markets and allow the renminbi to rise against the dollar.
China has also begun filing its own W.T.O. cases to challenge other countries' policies in the last three years, which it did not do for nearly six years after it joined the multilateral group in 2001. These include the cases against the tire tariffs and European Union over antidumping measures against Chinese footwear. The W.T. O. has extensive rules on antidumping tariffs. China has used those rules to challenge other countries' penalties.
Some experts on Chinese economic policy say Beijing is still committed to cooperative relations with trading partners.
''They don't want to be perceived as the guy flexing his muscles, because they are so interdependent with the outside world, especially with Japan and the United States,'' said Jiang Wenran, a specialist in Chinese natural resources policy and China-Japan relations at the University of Alberta in Canada.
But Beijing officials face intensifying internal pressure to stand up for China's perceived national interests.
''China feels increasingly under siege as it becomes an international economic power, as others try to contain it,'' Mr. Jiang said. ''They don't want to appear to be weak, because domestic pressure is mounting.''
China is an important market for American poultry, particularly for portions like chicken feet, which are a delicacy in China but barely marketable in the United States, said Gary Blumenthal, the chief executive of World Perspectives, an agriculture trade consulting firm in Washington.
American farmers and the Obama administration are likely to be particularly disappointed by the new poultry tariffs because China's increasing affluence has resulted in a surging appetite for protein, one that American chicken farms hoped to satisfy. ''China is viewed as a potentially hugely growing market for poultry,'' Mr. Blumenthal said.
The United States exports about $4 billion a year of chicken products, of which $678.2 million went to China last year, according to Global Trade Information Services in Columbia, S.C.
China's dispute with Japan over rare earth minerals continues to be murky, especially because the commerce agency has denied shipments were halted.
Chen Deming, China's commerce minister, said in an interview with Chinese television on Sunday that the government had complied with World Trade Organization rules by not ordering a ban on rare earth exports. But he seemed to hint that a halt on exports might have occurred anyway when he said that, ''I believeentrepreneurs, they will have their own feelings, and will do their own thing.''
There are 32 companies with rare earth export licenses in China, including 10 foreign firms. Mr. Chen was not asked why foreign companies would have felt a need to stop shipments.
Rare earths are important for automotive, electronics and clean energy industries. China mines 93 percent of the world's tonnage of rare earths.

HEADLINE: 4 Aid Workers Held in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; An Afghan employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Nangarhar Province.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Four aid workers for the United States Agency for International Development were kidnapped by gunmen on one of the country's major highways on Sunday, according to embassy and police officials. 
The provincial police chief, Gen. Khalilullah Ziayee, said the four, a British woman and three Afghan men, were stopped as they drove in two cars on the road from Jalalabad to Asadabad in Kunar Province, in the east of the country, and were taken away at gunpoint.
''We don't know who picked them up, but Taliban and Hezb-e-Islami fighters are active in the area,'' General Ziayee said.
Steven O'Connor, a spokesman for DAI, an American company that works exclusively for Usaid in Afghanistan, said the British woman and one of the Afghans were DAI employees, and the other two Afghan men were drivers whose employment status was unclear.
A British Embassy spokeswoman confirmed that a British citizen was missing in Afghanistan, ''and the embassy, working with other internationals, is urgently investigating the reports.'' She spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official policy.
General Ziayee said the four ''did not coordinate their trip with Afghan national security forces.''
There have been three kidnappings this year of aid workers in Kunar Province, all of whom worked for nonprofit organizations. All were released after negotiations with the kidnappers.

HEADLINE: Shifting Online, Netflix Faces New Competition

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Even though Netflix's arch rival Blockbuster has filed for bankruptcy protection, the victory lap will have to wait. The company that filled American mailboxes with red envelopes containing DVDs is already fighting the next war.
Netflix's competition with Blockbuster is an artifact of another age -- the DVD era. The main battlefront has shifted online, where consumers are streaming movies and television. Netflix faces a number of well-financed and innovative companies like Apple, Amazon and Google, as well as the cable TV providers. This time the war will not be won by the company that perfects the logistics of moving DVDs, but by whoever can best negotiate with Hollywood studios. 
''They are fighting a much different battle than Blockbuster,'' said Jim Lanzone, the chief executive of Clicker, an online television guide. ''Today's war is for Internet television, and Blockbuster was never really relevant to Internet television.''
Netflix, based in Los Gatos, Calif., had an early lead in online streaming with its subscription service, Watch Instantly. Customers can watch movies or TV shows on a computer or a television, or more recently, an iPad or iPhone. (Software for Android smartphones is coming.)
Netflix has raced to become ubiquitous. In addition to PCs, more than 100 types of devices can stream Netflix movies to a TV, including game consoles and Internet TV set-top boxes like Roku and AppleTV. The company says 61 percent of its 15 million subscribers streamed movies in the second quarter.
The weakness of the streaming service is movie selection. Netflix's catalog of 20,000 streaming movies does not include many recent Hollywood hits because Netflix has been unable to negotiate rights from all the studios. Netflix has about five times as many titles in its DVD catalog.
Many of the company's studio deals require it to delay making titles available -- either on DVD or online -- until they have been on store shelves for 28 days. For example, ''Robin Hood,'' starring Russell Crowe, is available to stream on Amazon but will not be available on Netflix until Oct. 19. Hulu Plus has the current season of ''The Office,'' while the most recent episodes on Netflix are from last season.
The industry is still very young, they said, and many companies are experimenting with business models and expanding their video libraries. Streaming requires less infrastructure and therefore has lower barriers to entry than a system built on sorting machines and distribution or even brick-and-mortar stores.
''Streaming is a much more competitive environment, and Netflix's competitors have the money it takes,'' said John Blackledge, an analyst with Credit Suisse. Few weeks go by without some strategic maneuver by a company with ambitions in streaming movies or television.
YouTube signaled its larger ambitions last week by hiring a former Netflix vice president for content acquisition. YouTube, part of Google, is counting on him to license more Hollywood video to beef up its nascent online rental service, which premiered in January. YouTube has mostly small, independent movies, but it recently secured rights to more mainstream movies from Lions Gate Entertainment.
Apple unveiled an upgraded Apple TV device for streaming video to television sets. Fox and ABC agreed to make their shows available for rental at 99 cents each.
Hulu, the online video hub jointly owned by NBC Universal, the News Corporation and the Walt Disney Company, in June opened its Hulu Plus subscription service to supplement its existing free video library. Under the plan, which costs $10 a month, consumers can watch some television shows that are not available free. (Paying customers still see commercials, though.)
Netflix declined to comment for this article. But a new streaming service it began last week in Canada may be a sign of where the company is headed. Netflix is selling a subscription for online streaming only, with no DVDs. That gives Netflix a chance to conquer a second market without conquering another postal system (or building new distribution centers).
In the United States, analysts expect the company to begin closing some of its 58 distribution centers as DVD rentals decline. The company has said it is not making any more major investments in the centers.
Mr. Blackledge of Credit Suisse predicts that Netflix's DVD business will peak in 2012 and then slowly decline. Shifting people to watching movies online will save Netflix some of the $700 million it spends annually on postage.
A streaming-only subscription is also being considered for the United States in the coming months, Reed Hastings, Netflix's chief executive, wrote in a company blog post last week. Presumably, the plan would be cheaper than the company's standard $9 monthly subscription because it would not include the cost of mailing DVDs.
Netflix is making less revenue per customer as streaming catches on because customers are subscribing to less expensive plans, with fewer discs and unlimited streaming. But the company is gaining subscribers at the rate of nearly 50 percent a year.
''Netflix has been very clever and good at getting good content,'' Mr. Blackledge said. ''It's the virtuous cycle: They get new subscribers, which improves their finances, which allows them to get more and better content.''

HEADLINE: Blaming China Won't Help the Economy

BYLINE: By ANATOLE KALETSKY. 
Anatole Kaletsky, the chief economist of a Hong Kong-based investment advisory firm, is the author of ''Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis.''

 BODY:
London
IT is a safe bet that Asian currency intervention was not on the minds of Republican primary voters in Delaware this month when they selected a Tea Party favorite, Christine O'Donnell, as their Senate candidate. But the pendulum swings in American politics are a key concern of Wen Jiabao and Naoto Kan, the prime ministers of China and Japan, respectively, who both met with President Obama in New York on Thursday, with the loss of American jobs to Asian competition high on the agenda.
The Asian nations' interest in American politics stems not just from America's standing as the sole global superpower, but also from a growing belief among Asian leaders that the era of United States hegemony will soon be over, and that the polarization of its politics symbolizes America's inability to adapt to the changing nature of global capitalism after the financial crisis. 
What does this sweeping statement have to do with the price of yen? Plenty. On Sept. 15, the yen dropped sharply against the dollar, improving the competitiveness of Japanese exporters. After a brief bounce last week, expect the downward trend to continue. Mr. Kan's government has decided to follow the lead of China and other Asian nations in ''managing'' (some critics would say manipulating) its currency; it spent a record $23 billion in a single day on foreign exchanges -- the largest such intervention ever -- instead of leaving the yen's value entirely to market forces.
To understand how this decision will affect the United States, we must start with parochial politics -- not in Delaware, but in the larger parish called Asia, which remains terra incognita to most American politicians and voters.
In Asian politics, what you see is often the opposite of what you get. On Sept 14. Mr. Kan, generally seen as favoring free markets, held on to his job in an intraparty election after a bitter challenge from his rival Ichiro Ozawa, who had loudly demanded a Chinese-style policy of currency intervention to keep the value of the yen low. Given Mr. Kan's victory, investors assumed that currency intervention was off the agenda and piled into the yen, lifting it to a 15-year high against the dollar. It turns out, however, that Mr. Kan, in winning the election, may have tacitly ceded control of economic policy to Mr. Ozawa, known as the ''shadow shogun'' for his prowess in backroom dealing. Hence the ensuing sell-off of the yen.
The decision to break with free-market ideology and spend government money to control the yen's value against the dollar was mainly driven by Japan's relationship with China, not America. Japanese companies including Sony and Toyota that had demanded government action devaluing the yen were not concerned primarily with their competitiveness against America rivals. The motivation was a fear of being undercut by exporters in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- all countries that aggressively manage their exchange rates.
With Chinese economic policy now serving as a model for other Asian countries, Japan was faced with a stark choice: back United States criticisms that China is artificially keeping down the value of its currency, the renminbi, or emulate China's approach. It is a sign of the times that Japan chose to follow China at the cost of irritating America.
Japan's action suggests that, in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the dominance of free-market thinking in international economic management is over. Washington must understand this, or find itself constantly outmaneuvered in dealings with the rest of the world. Instead of obsessing over China's currency manipulation as if it were a unique exception in a world of untrammeled market forces, the United States must adapt to an environment where exchange rates and trade imbalances are managed consciously and have become a legitimate subject for debate in international forums like the Group of 20.
Market fundamentalists who feel that government interference with free markets is anathema should be reminded that, by today's dogmatic standards, Ronald Reagan is one of the great manipulators of all time. He presided over two of the biggest currency interventions in history: the Plaza agreement, which devalued the dollar in 1985, and the Louvre accord of 1987, which brought this devaluation to an end.
The fact is that the rules of global capitalism have changed irrevocably since Lehman Brothers collapsed two years ago -- and if the United States refuses to accept this, it will find its global leadership slipping away. The near collapse of the financial system was an ''Emperor's New Clothes'' moment of revelation.
In this climate, the market fundamentalism now represented by the Tea Party, based on instinctive aversion to government and a faith that ''the market is always right,'' is a global laughingstock. Yet more moderate figures from both parties largely hold the same view: a measure to punish China over its currency passed the House Ways and Means committee on Friday with bipartisan support.
Outside America, however, a strong conviction now exists that some new version of global capitalism must evolve to replace what the economist John Williamson coined the ''Washington consensus.''
If market forces cannot do something as simple as financing home mortgages, can markets be trusted to restore and maintain full employment, reduce global imbalances or prevent the destruction of the environment and prepare for a future without fossil fuels? This is the question that policymakers outside America, especially in Asia, are now asking. And the answer, as so often in economics, is ''yes and no.''
Yes, because markets are the best mechanism for allocating scarce resources. No, because market investors are often short-sighted, fail to reflect widely held social objectives and sometimes make catastrophic mistakes. There are times, therefore, when governments must deliberately shape market incentives to achieve objectives that are determined by politics and not by the markets themselves, including financial stability, environmental protection, energy independence and poverty relief.
This doesn't necessarily mean that governments get bigger. The new model of capitalism evolving in Asia and parts of Europe generally requires government to be smaller, but more effective. Many activities taken for granted in America as prerogatives of government have long since been privatized in foreign nations -- even in what so many Americans view as socialistic Europe.
In France, Germany, Japan and Sweden, water supplies, highways, airports and even postal services are increasingly run by the private sector. For home mortgages to be backed by government guarantees would be unthinkable anywhere in Asia or Europe. Tax systems, too, are in some ways less redistributionist in Europe and Asia than they are in the United States. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the proportion of income tax raised from the richest tenth of the population is 45 percent in America, compared with only 28 percent in France and 27 percent in Sweden. These countries raise money for public services mainly from middle-class voters, through consumption and energy taxes, not by soaking the rich.
AS a result, these nations' budgets are more stable and their governments have more ability to support their economies in times of crisis. They are also better positioned to manage their currencies and their trade relations, subsidize long-term investment in nuclear and solar energy, and spend money on infrastructure, job retraining and education. In America, by contrast, the tax system's dependence on revenues from the richest citizens means that the social safety net and long-term goals like energy independence can be achieved only if the rich keep getting richer.
Which brings us back to Delaware. What if America decides to ignore the global reinvention of capitalism and opts instead for a nostalgic rerun of the experiment in market fundamentalism? This would not prevent the rest of the world from changing course.
Rather, it would make it likely that the newly dominant economic model will not be a product of democratic capitalism, based on Western values and American leadership. Instead, it will be an authoritarian state-led capitalism inspired by Asian values. If America opts, for the first time in history, for nostalgia and ideology instead of pragmatism and progress, then the new model of capitalism will probably be made in China, like so much else in the world these days.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Afghan Troops Start Combat for Kandahar

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Tyler Hicks contributed reporting from Zhari, Afghanistan, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar.

 BODY:
ARGHANDAB, Afghanistan -- American and Afghan troops began active combat last week in an offensive to drive the Taliban out of their strongholds surrounding the city of Kandahar, military officials said Sunday.
In the last several days, soldiers shifted from guarding aid workers and sipping tea with village elders to actively hunting down Taliban fighters in marijuana fields and pomegranate orchards laced with booby traps.
Sixteen Americans have died in the push so far, including two killed by a roadside bomb on Sunday.
The combat phase began five or six days ago in the Arghandab, Zhari and Panjwai Districts, Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz, a NATO spokesman in Kabul, said, defining the current phase for the first time. 
''We expect hard fighting,'' he said of the offensive, whose objective is to clear the Taliban from three districts to the west and south of the city.
Winning over Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban, is considered crucial to President Obama's efforts to shift the balance of power in Afghanistan after the militants' comeback of recent years.
''This is the most significant military operation ongoing in Afghanistan,'' General Blotz, who is with the International Security Assistance Force of NATO, said, calling it the ''top operational priority now.''
This is the first large-scale combat operation involving multiple objectives in Kandahar Province, where a military offensive was originally expected to begin in June. That offensive was downgraded to more of a joint civil-military effort after the military encountered problems containing the Taliban in the much smaller city of Marja and because Afghan leaders feared high civilian casualties.
During the last week of August, at the instigation of Afghan authorities, American troops supported a major push into the Mehlajat area on the southwest edge of Kandahar City, driving the Taliban from that area with few casualties on either side.
At the time, military officials said that was the beginning of what would be an increase in active combat around Kandahar.
Bismillah Khan, the police chief in the Zhari District, confirmed that the combat operation there began on Saturday, but he declined to give further details. Some of the heaviest fighting has been in Zhari, where troops have been told to avoid contact with local people because of widespread hostility toward foreign forces there.
Zhari is the hometown of the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar, and it also sits astride the strategic Highway 1, connecting Kandahar with Helmand Province to the west.
Often the soldiers there run what are known as ''move to contact'' patrols that have no goal but to draw fire from the Taliban so aircraft can find and kill them.
Last Tuesday, a United States Army platoon left Forward Operating Base Wilson early in the morning and within 10 minutes, Taliban insurgents had opened fire with small arms, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
Although helicopter gunships were soon overhead to support the ground forces, the insurgents continued to fire on the patrol throughout the day as the troops made their way through vineyards and fields of marijuana plants 10 feet high.
None of the Americans were wounded or killed on that patrol.
Journalists from The New York Times, during a weeklong stay there, observed that every time soldiers left their bases, they were either shot at or hit with bombs, often hidden or booby-trapped.
Frequently, the Taliban did not -- as they normally would -- stop shooting once air support arrived.
Soldiers on a recent patrol, clearing up after one bomb explosion, discovered that a piece of debris lodged in a tree had itself been rigged with a tripwire, practically under their noses.
Here in Arghandab, the flow of troops has made it possible to begin trying to take control of an area where thick vegetation, irrigation canals and pomegranate orchards provide good cover for the Taliban, according to Lt. Col. Joseph Krebs, deputy commander for the Second Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, but the results have been mixed.
No sooner had the First Battalion of the 22nd Armored Regiment of the Army arrived here than five soldiers were killed on Aug. 30, by a roadside bomb directed at their convoy. The dead included the first Army chaplain to be killed in active duty during the Afghan conflict.
The chaplain, Capt. Dale A. Goetz, 43, had been on a tour of some of the 18 combat outposts the military has established in the Arghandab District.
Three days later, rockets fired from orchards just outside the district center hit the dining tent at the main American base, slightly wounding five soldiers.
While no official casualty totals have been released for the recent operations in the Kandahar districts, American military reports list 16 American fatalities in the Kandahar area since Aug. 30, at least 10 of which were in the Arghandab or Zhari Districts.
An effort to bring all of the heavily Pashtun south under coalition control began on Feb. 14 with an attempt to suppress the Taliban in and around Marja. Kandahar was to be the next target.
But the Taliban in Marja have still not been subdued, so officials decided to concentrate first on bringing economic development to some districts around Kandahar city, then on gradually stepping up military operations.
''I look at each one of my 13 combat platoons as a development team,'' said Lt. Col. Rodger Lemons, commander of the First Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment, stationed at the district headquarters here.
''I'm not going to tell you the population is fully in support, but they are much more in support of the government and the coalition than they are of the Taliban,'' he said.
Along with the military buildup has come a similar effort to increase the presence of State Department employees, along with aid contractors paid by the Americans, who would serve as stabilization teams in those areas.
Although some 300 American civilian staff members have arrived in Kandahar Province, at the district levels there are only a few, mainly because of security concerns.
In Arghandab, where the civilian effort is deemed to have been the most successful, the district team consists of two Americans in addition to contractors and local employees.
''It's hard to get people to come here,'' said Kevin Melton, who is finishing up a yearlong tour running the State Department team in Arghandab.
When Mr. Melton arrived, the district government was not functioning. Now, there is an active shura or village council, with people coming to the district government's building regularly, attracted by generous aid programs.
''Five dead and that's the news that gets out,'' Mr. Melton said, referring to the first fatalities in Arghandab. ''Yeah, we know what's going wrong, but look what's going right. If we had done this eight years ago, would we have been here now?''
By comparison, other districts like Zhari and Panjwai are just getting started, he said.

HEADLINE: Number of Tenants Owing Back Rent Rises Sharply at City Housing Authority

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
In a sign of the toll the dismal economy has taken on working families in New York, more than 1 in 10 households living in public housing owe at least one month in back rent, a rise of nearly 50 percent over the past year.
Though the city has always had to deal with a number of public housing tenants who are chronically late with their rent, housing officials are now confronting a significant rise in longtime tenants who never before missed a payment but are falling behind, in many cases because they have lost their jobs.
Across the city, tenants of nearly 22,000 public housing apartments, or about 12 percent of the total, owed back rent as of Aug. 31, according to the New York City Housing Authority, which runs the largest public housing system in the United States. The comparable figure in August 2009 was about 15,200.
''When you have, like any landlord, a laser-beam focus on rent collection, you sometimes miss the bigger picture,'' said John B. Rhea, the housing authority's chairman. ''What's happening is that we're seeing substantial increases in the number of people not paying their rent on time.'' 
The problem is the worst in Queens, where the number of households owing back rent increased nearly 70 percent between August 2009 and last month, to 2,424 from 1,431. In six of the public housing developments in the western part of the borough, more tenants missed payments than anyplace else in the city, according to Housing Authority statistics. At the Astoria Houses, for example, the number more than doubled, to 157 households from 64; the latest number is 14 percent of the development's 1,103 apartments.
It does not take much to send a family over the edge. For Shonette Conners, 39, it was the birth of a child. For Denise Haynes, 54, it was not getting paid at her part-time job when complications from her diabetes forced her to miss work on several occasions over the past two years.
''It's like the more I try, the more I fall behind,'' said Ms. Haynes, who lives alone at the Astoria Houses and owes about $2,000 in back rent. Ms. Conners and Ms. Haynes have both appeared in housing court, asking a judge for more time to settle their debt and avoid eviction. The housing agency, which provides subsidized apartments for about 8 percent of the city's residents, usually moves quickly to remove tenants who fall behind on rent.
But as the sluggish economy continues to eat into tenants' pocketbooks, the agency has decided to try to find a way to keep people in their homes. Under a program it is announcing on Monday, it will start offering payment plans, longer extensions and other incentives to help tenants pay their back rent before they end up in court.
The program is aimed mainly at residents who are unable to keep up with their bills after losing a job or are facing other unforeseen difficulty. The idea is to reward those who commit to actions like following budget plans and opening a bank account.
''We want to see if we can help people get out of the hole,'' Mr. Rhea said.
In most cases, after a tenant fails to pay rent for more than a month, a disciplinary process unfolds that is at once costly and cumbersome for the Housing Authority and stressful for the resident.
The authority spends about $1 million a year issuing warning notices and holding administrative hearings, Mr. Rhea said, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more that it spends on lawyers representing the agency in housing court. There is also the money it does not collect in rent while evictions are under way, he said.
''The process is necessary, but it doesn't necessarily give the residents the tools they need to manage their lives better,'' Mr. Rhea said in an interview. ''And at the end of the day, our goal is to provide housing, not to put people out on the street.''
Rent is the Housing Authority's largest source of revenue, but it is also one of its worst headaches. Sheila Stainback, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that in an average month, the authority is owed more than $20 million in uncollected rent.
As the economy sputtered, officials started weighing whether it might be in the Housing Authority's best interest to get some payment from tenants who are struggling while working to make sure they eventually get back on their feet.
The program will start on a small basis, focusing on tenants in six public housing projects in Queens with some of the worst records for missed payments, and may expand citywide if it is judged to be a success.
Potential participants include tenants who have stopped paying rent abruptly after years of regular payment or who have been late sporadically in recent years, as well as residents already seeking financial assistance from one of the Housing Authority's partners in the program, the East River Development Alliance, a nonprofit agency in Queens.
The alliance's president, the Rev. Mitchell G. Taylor, senior pastor of the nondenominational church Center of Hope International, said that beyond figuring out what caused people to stop paying rent, the program's goals involved ''creating a plan and budget that will stabilize families moving forward.''
The other partner in the program is the United Way of New York City, which also coaxed the Housing Authority to try a new approach. Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr., whose district includes some of the housing developments with high rates of missed rent payments, provided $150,000 in Council funds for the program.
''I'm not in favor of handouts, and this program is not a handout,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''It's about personal responsibility. It's about people taking control of their finances.''
The goal of the pilot program is to reach 2,000 people in the two years at Astoria Houses, Baisley Park Houses in Jamaica, Pomonok Houses in Flushing, Woodside Houses and the Ravenswood and Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City.
Ms. Conners, who has lived at the Astoria Houses for eight years, said her troubles began after her son was born in May 2009 and she had to rely on disability checks to cover her expenses while on maternity leave from a job as a medical biller at a nonprofit AIDS center. She has three other children -- one in college, one in high school and one in middle school.
By law, public housing residents are supposed to pay only one-third of their income in rent, but Ms. Conners said it took the Housing Authority three months to adjust her payments when her income fell because she was on leave. Then in November, shortly after she returned to work, the nonprofit agency laid her off.
Ms. Conners has been collecting unemployment benefits and said she set aside a little every month to pay the $1,000 she owed in back rent. The East River Development Alliance helped her redo her resume and budget her expenses. She is working toward an online accounting degree and is seeking work.
''If I know that I won't have the threat of eviction hanging over my head,'' Ms. Conners said, ''at least I'll sleep in peace.''

HEADLINE: China Rights Report Cites Improvements, but Also Failings

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China released a report on human rights on Sunday, highlighting the country's willingness to deal with the highly contentious issue but also the differences between its perceptions of human rights and those of many other countries. 
The report acknowledged that China suffers from large inequalities in its practice of human rights, and that ''there is still much room for improvement in its human rights conditions.'' But it said that the country had made large strides despite difficult economic times.
Published on the Internet in Chinese and English, the report lists achievements in a variety of fields, including the growing role of the Internet. It noted that many government agencies now routinely use the Web to gauge public opinion, and highlighted a new law passed this year to outlaw police brutality and torture after exposes in the local press about the abuse of detainees.
Outside human rights groups said that these steps were real and that China deserved credit for them, but they pointed to what they said was the country's history of passing laws that are not enforced. ''China deserves credit for taking that step of making new rules where they didn't exist before,'' said Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights group in Hong Kong. ''But that can't stand for actual results. The legislation itself needs to be enforced before you can measure its impact.''
Assessing enforcement is difficult because the government outlaws independent human rights monitors.
Over all, the report contrasts sharply with outside assessments. This year, the United States State Department found in its annual review of human rights that the situation in China remained ''poor and worsened in some areas.''
Part of the reason for these widely divergent opinions has to do with China's definitions of human rights. Much of its report was taken up with a detailed discussion on the economic rights of the Chinese people and how the growing economy was raising living standards and providing better education. Many international human rights organizations consider these rights, while important, to be a separate category. For China, however, they are at least on a par with rights like free speech and the right to assemble and to vote without intimidation.
Despite those differing views, some critics were encouraged.
''It is positive because people will talk about it and it gets in the local media,'' said Wan Yanhai, a public health activist who recently left China because of harassment. ''But it is publicized by the government for outsiders.''

HEADLINE: Trapped in a Comfort Zone

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
A few years before Apple introduced the iPhone, research engineers at Nokia prepared a prototype of an Internet-ready, touch-screen handset with a large display, which they thought could give the company a powerful advantage in the fast-growing smartphone market.
The prototype was demonstrated to business customers at Nokia's headquarters in Finland as an example of what was in the company's pipeline, according to a former employee who made the 2004 presentation in Espoo.
But management worried that the product could be a costly flop, said the former employee, Ari Hakkarainen, a manager responsible for marketing on the development team for the Nokia Series 60, then the company's premium line of smartphones. Nokia did not pursue development, he said.
''It was very early days, and no one really knew anything about the touch screen's potential,'' Mr. Hakkarainen explained. ''And it was an expensive device to produce, so there was more risk involved for Nokia. So management did the usual. They killed it.'' 
As Nokia's new chief executive, Stephen Elop, takes over this month, he faces a formidable task: to regain the company's lost ground in the smartphone segment of the global phone market, especially in the United States, while maintaining its worldwide dominance as the largest maker of mobile phones.
His biggest obstacle, according to Mr. Hakkarainen, as well as two other former employees and industry analysts, may well be Nokia's stifling bureaucratic culture. In interviews, Mr. Hakkarainen and the other former employees depicted an organization so swollen by its early success that it grew complacent, slow and removed from consumer desires. As a result, they said, Nokia lost the lead in several crucial areas by failing to fast-track its designs for touch screens, software applications and 3-D interfaces.
In 2004, one said, the company rejected an early design for a Nokia online applications store -- an innovation that Apple, Nokia and other handset makers adopted three years later. Nokia also did not improve its Symbian operating system, needed to support a more sophisticated smartphone. And though it introduced the industry's first touch-screen devices in 2003 -- the 6108 and 3108 phones, which worked with a stylus -- it did not perfect the technology to fingertip precision before Apple did.
Nokia still lacks a convincing response to the iPhone. Last week it announced that software errors would delay shipments of its long-awaited N8 touch-screen phone.
A Nokia spokeswoman, Arja Suominen, declined to address any specific criticisms by the three former employees, playing down their roles. They were, she said, ''managers with individual roles or leaders of small teams.''
She also said that Mr. Elop, 46, a Canadian who had run Microsoft's business software division, and the first non-Finnish chief executive, would not give interviews yet. He began work on Sept. 21, and is spending his first weeks meeting with Nokia employees, suppliers, phone operators and software developers.
''I am sure there are things we could have done better and innovations we missed,'' Ms. Suominen added. ''But that happens to all companies. We have been very successful with some other innovations.''
She cited Nokia's large patent portfolio and its 770 Internet Tablet, a compact, flat-screen device without a phone, released in 2005. It worked with a pen stylus and was made for Internet browsing but is no longer sold.
Henry Tirri, who leads Nokia's long-term research unit, mentioned the development of Chinese character recognition, a social networking service for India and software that makes panoramic photos from a series of images. None have been matched by rivals, he said. But none have been game changers, as the iPhone was.
Mr. Tirri, whose unit has about 600 employees at 12 sites worldwide, said the company was trying to change its culture. ''We have made a real effort to transform and open the research channels'' since 2004, he said.
As of June, Nokia controlled 40.3 percent of the worldwide market for mobile phones, down from 40.7 percent a year earlier, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. That global share has remained relatively constant over the last decade.
But in the United States, its share has slipped from 35 percent in March 2002 to 8.1 percent in April, according to comScore, a provider of digital market intelligence based in Reston, Va. It has offset the decline in the United States, with growth in China, Asia and elsewhere.
The decline in the United States is mostly because of the rise of the smartphone competitors, like Apple, Research in Motion and Samsung. And the biggest profits are attributable to the most advanced devices.
Apple delivers consistently higher profit margins than Nokia.
Still, Nokia is on track this year to sell more than 70 million smartphones worldwide; Apple sold 33 million iPhones in the year through June 26.
''Nokia in a sense is a victim of its own success,'' said Jyrki Ali-Yrkko, an economist at the private Research Institute of the Finnish Economy. ''It stayed with its playbook too long and didn't change with the times. Now it's time to make changes.''
Founded in 1865 as a paper mill, Nokia is a source of national pride in Finland. With a work force of 129,000, it is by far the country's largest private employer, accounting for 1.6 percent of the gross domestic product and more than 10 percent of exports.
In the last five years, Nokia has built a more international research staff, but most board members are Finnish and Nokia's character remains so.
Critics have often blamed Nokia's Symbian operating system for the company's failure to pull ahead in smartphones, saying it is so clunky that developers have not been willing to write applications for it.
Kai Nyman, Nokia's former chief architect for enterprise domain strategy, a unit responsible for Internet services, said his team's job was to improve the operating system for smartphones.
He knew about the Internet-ready, touch-screen prototype, he said, although he never saw it and was not at the 2004 demonstration. But he suggested that management had been reluctant to proceed because of concerns over the performance of the operating system, and that the company was too cautious.
''There were plenty of years to make Symbian better,'' said Mr. Nyman, who was at Nokia from 1983 to 2009, and took early retirement. ''We could have rewritten the whole code several times over. We had the resources and the people. But we didn't do it.''
Juhani Risku, a manager who worked on user interface designs for Symbian from 2001 to 2009, said his team had offered 500 proposals to improve Symbian but could not get even one through.
''It was management by committee,'' Mr. Risku said, comparing the company's design approval processes to a ''Soviet-style'' bureaucracy. Ideas fell victim to fighting among managers with competing agendas, he said, or were rejected as too costly, risky or insignificant for a global market leader. Mr. Risku said he had left in frustration at its culture; he now designs environmentally sound buildings.
Mr. Risku also said that in 2002, he proposed a 3-D user interface for Symbian handsets, which at the time would have been unique to Nokia. He said his plan had been rejected because the software would have added $2.05 in production costs to each handset.
Samsung and LG introduced the first phones with a 3-D user interface in 2009. Nokia sold the N-95 handset with 3-D graphics in 2006 and has said it might offer a full 3-D interface for this year's holiday season.
Mr. Hakkarainen, the manager on a smartphone development team, said that in 2004, his team developed the early design for a Nokia online applications store.
''We demonstrated it within Nokia and said this is what we needed,'' said Mr. Hakkarainen, who worked at Nokia from 1999 through 2007. ''We tried to convince middle and upper management. But there was no way.''
He also described a highly bureaucratic corporate culture, in which proposals were screened by interlocking management committees with authority to block ideas under consensual rules for decision making.
Proposals were often rejected because their payoffs were seen as too small, he said. But ''successful innovations often begin small and become very big.''
He said he had left the company to write. ''Behind the Screen,'' his chronicle of the company's successes, was published in 2009.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Fairly Healthy Public Libraries, Town Hears a Roar

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- A private company in Maryland has taken over public libraries in ailing cities in California, Oregon, Tennessee and Texas, growing into the country's fifth-largest library system.
Now the company, Library Systems & Services, has been hired for the first time to run a system in a relatively healthy city, setting off an intense and often acrimonious debate about the role of outsourcing in a ravaged economy.
A $4 million deal to run the three libraries here is a chance for the company to demonstrate that a dose of private management can be good for communities, whatever their financial situation. But in an era when outsourcing is most often an act of budget desperation -- with janitors, police forces and even entire city halls farmed out in one town or another -- the contract in Santa Clarita has touched a deep nerve and begun a round of second-guessing.
Can a municipal service like a library hold so central a place that it should be entrusted to a profit-driven contractor only as a last resort -- and maybe not even then? 
''There's this American flag, apple pie thing about libraries,'' said Frank A. Pezzanite, the outsourcing company's chief executive. He has pledged to save $1 million a year in Santa Clarita, mainly by cutting overhead and replacing unionized employees. ''Somehow they have been put in the category of a sacred organization.''
The company, known as L.S.S.I., runs 14 library systems operating 63 locations. Its basic pitch to cities is that it fixes broken libraries -- more often than not by cleaning house.
''A lot of libraries are atrocious,'' Mr. Pezzanite said. ''Their policies are all about job security. That's why the profession is nervous about us. You can go to a library for 35 years and never have to do anything and then have your retirement. We're not running our company that way. You come to us, you're going to have to work.''
The members of the Santa Clarita City Council who voted to hire L.S.S.I. acknowledge there was no immediate threat to the libraries. The council members say they want to ensure the libraries' long-term survival in a state with increasingly shaky finances.
Until now, the three branch locations have been part of the Los Angeles County library system. Under the new contract, the branches will be withdrawn from county control and all operations -- including hiring staff and buying books -- ceded to L.S.S.I.
''The libraries are still going to be public libraries,'' said the mayor pro tem, Marsha McLean. ''When people say we're privatizing libraries, that is just not a true statement, period.''
Library employees are furious about the contract. But the reaction has been mostly led by patrons who say they cannot imagine Santa Clarita with libraries run for profit.
''A library is the heart of the community,'' said one opponent, Jane Hanson. ''I'm in favor of private enterprise, but I can't feel comfortable with what the city is doing here.''
Mrs. Hanson and her husband, Tom, go to their local branch every week or two to pick up tapes for the car and books to read after dinner. Mrs. Hanson recently checked out Willa Cather's classic ''Death Comes for the Archbishop,'' although she was only mildly in favor of its episodic style; she has higher hopes for her current choice, on the shadowy world of North Korea.
The suggestion that a library is different -- and somehow off limits to the outsourcing fever -- has been echoed wherever L.S.S.I. has gone. The head of the county library system, Margaret Donnellan Todd, says L.S.S.I. is viewed as an unwelcome outsider.
''There is no local connection,'' she said. ''People are receiving superb service in Santa Clarita. I challenge that L.S.S.I. will be able to do much better.''
As a recent afternoon shaded into evening, there were more than a hundred patrons at the main Santa Clarita library. Students were doing their homework. Old men paged through newspapers. Children gathered up arm's loads of picture books. It was a portrait of civic harmony and engagement.
Mrs. Hanson, who is 81 and has been a library patron for nearly 50 years, was so bothered by the outsourcing contract that she became involved in local politics for the first time since 1969, when she worked for a recall movement related to the Vietnam War.
She drew up a petition warning that the L.S.S.I. contract would result in ''greater cost, fewer books and less access,'' with ''no benefit to the citizens.'' Using a card table in front of the main library branch, she gathered 1,200 signatures in three weekends.
L.S.S.I. says none of Mrs. Hanson's fears are warranted, but the anti-outsourcing forces continue to air their suspicions at private meetings and public forums, even wondering whether a recall election is feasible.
''Public libraries invoke images of our freedom to learn, a cornerstone of our democracy,'' Deanna Hanashiro, a retired teacher, said at the most recent city council meeting.
Frank Ferry, a Santa Clarita councilman, dismisses the criticism as the work of the Service Employees International Union, which has 87 members in the libraries. The union has been distributing red shirts defending the status quo. ''Union members out in red shirts in defense of union jobs,'' Mr. Ferry said.
Library employees are often the most resistant to his company, said Mr. Pezzanite, a co-founder of L.S.S.I. -- and, he suggested, for reasons that only reinforce the need for a new approach.
''Pensions crushed General Motors, and it is crushing the governments in California,'' he said. While the company says it rehires many of the municipal librarians, they must be content with a 401(k) retirement fund and no pension.
L.S.S.I. got its start 30 years ago developing software for government use, then expanded into running libraries for federal agencies. In the mid-1990s, it moved into the municipal library market, and now, when ranked by number of branches, it places immediately after Los Angeles County, New York City, Chicago and the City of Los Angeles.
The company is majority owned by Islington Capital Partners, a private equity firm in Boston, and has about $35 million in annual revenue and 800 employees. Officials would not discuss the company's profitability.
Some L.S.S.I. customers have ended their contracts, while in other places, opposition has faded with time. In Redding, Calif., Jim Ceragioli, a board member of the Friends of Shasta County Library, said he initially counted himself among the skeptics.
But he has since changed his mind. ''I can't think of anything that's been lost,'' Mr. Ceragioli said.
The library in Redding has expanded its services and hours. And the volunteers are still showing up -- even if their assistance is now aiding a private company. ''We volunteer more than ever now,'' Mr. Ceragioli said.

HEADLINE: Turning Tables, Japan Asks China to Pay For Damages

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Martin Fackler reported from Tokyo.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Chinese-Japanese tensions over the arrest of a Chinese trawler captain re-escalated on Monday when Japan said it would ask China to pay for repairs to two coast guard ships damaged by the trawler. 
The Japanese request was effectively a retort to China's demand that Japan apologize and offer compensation for the episode, even after Japan had freed the captain last Friday in what was widely seen as a capitulation to placate an increasingly assertive China.
On Sunday, Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, called China's latest demands ''unthinkable,'' a sign of his sensitivity to criticism that Japan had shown timidity to Chinese bullying.
''Naturally, we will be asking for the boats to be returned to their original condition,'' the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, told a news conference here on Monday.
The Japanese release of the captain seemed aimed at defusing a heated standoff in which China had imposed economic sanctions and even detained four Japanese.
But the Japanese were clearly surprised when China then said that Tokyo must offer an apology and unspecified compensation over the arrest, which took place almost three weeks ago and aroused deep anger in China.
The demands have forced Mr. Kan to decide once again whether Tokyo will stand up to Beijing, which in recent years has appeared to be testing Japan's resolve to back its territorial claims in the East China Sea.
In the days leading up to the captain's release, the Chinese curtailed tourism to Japan, suspended many political and cultural ties, and took unannounced steps to restrict shipments to Japan of rare-earth minerals, which are important components for a range of industrial products.
But the move that Japan found most alarming was the detention in the northern city of Shijiazhuang of the four Japanese citizens, accused of photographing military sites.
The dispute illustrated the difficulty of overcoming nationalistic sentiments stirred up by the trawler episode, which is affecting the deeply intertwined ties between the two neighbors, the world's second- and third-largest economies, after that of the United States. It also raised concern across Asia about China's willingness to use its growing economic clout for political gains.
Japanese leaders had sought to minimize the episode, saying that the Chinese captain's release was a decision made by local prosecutors. Those assertions were met with broad skepticism, with many here holding the view that Japan capitulated to aggressive Chinese pressure.
This has led to growing criticism in Japan that Mr. Kan's government showed weakness. ''It looks like Japan caved in,'' said Sadakazu Tanigaki, the head of the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democrats. ''That sends the wrong signal to China.''

HEADLINE: Structure Of Excuses

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
What can be done about mass unemployment? All the wise heads agree: there are no quick or easy answers. There is work to be done, but workers aren't ready to do it -- they're in the wrong places, or they have the wrong skills. Our problems are ''structural,'' and will take many years to solve.
But don't bother asking for evidence that justifies this bleak view. There isn't any. On the contrary, all the facts suggest that high unemployment in America is the result of inadequate demand -- full stop. Saying that there are no easy answers sounds wise, but it's actually foolish: our unemployment crisis could be cured very quickly if we had the intellectual clarity and political will to act. 
In other words, structural unemployment is a fake problem, which mainly serves as an excuse for not pursuing real solutions.
Who are these wise heads I'm talking about? The most widely quoted figure is Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who has attracted a lot of attention by insisting that dealing with high unemployment isn't a Fed responsibility: ''Firms have jobs, but can't find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can't find appropriate jobs,'' he asserts, concluding that ''It is hard to see how the Fed can do much to cure this problem.''
Now, the Minneapolis Fed is known for its conservative outlook, and claims that unemployment is mainly structural do tend to come from the right of the political spectrum. But some people on the other side of the aisle say similar things. For example, former President Bill Clinton recently told an interviewer that unemployment remained high because ''people don't have the job skills for the jobs that are open.''
Well, I'd respectfully suggest that Mr. Clinton talk to researchers at the Roosevelt Institute and the Economic Policy Institute, both of which have recently released important reports completely debunking claims of a surge in structural unemployment.
After all, what should we be seeing if statements like those of Mr. Kocherlakota or Mr. Clinton were true? The answer is, there should be significant labor shortages somewhere in America -- major industries that are trying to expand but are having trouble hiring, major classes of workers who find their skills in great demand, major parts of the country with low unemployment even as the rest of the nation suffers.
None of these things exist. Job openings have plunged in every major sector, while the number of workers forced into part-time employment in almost all industries has soared. Unemployment has surged in every major occupational category. Only three states, with a combined population not much larger than that of Brooklyn, have unemployment rates below 5 percent.
Oh, and where are these firms that ''can't find appropriate workers''? The National Federation of Independent Business has been surveying small businesses for many years, asking them to name their most important problem; the percentage citing problems with labor quality is now at an all-time low, reflecting the reality that these days even highly skilled workers are desperate for employment.
So all the evidence contradicts the claim that we're mainly suffering from structural unemployment. Why, then, has this claim become so popular?
Part of the answer is that this is what always happens during periods of high unemployment -- in part because pundits and analysts believe that declaring the problem deeply rooted, with no easy answers, makes them sound serious.
I've been looking at what self-proclaimed experts were saying about unemployment during the Great Depression; it was almost identical to what Very Serious People are saying now. Unemployment cannot be brought down rapidly, declared one 1935 analysis, because the work force is ''unadaptable and untrained. It cannot respond to the opportunities which industry may offer.'' A few years later, a large defense buildup finally provided a fiscal stimulus adequate to the economy's needs -- and suddenly industry was eager to employ those ''unadaptable and untrained'' workers.
But now, as then, powerful forces are ideologically opposed to the whole idea of government action on a sufficient scale to jump-start the economy. And that, fundamentally, is why claims that we face huge structural problems have been proliferating: they offer a reason to do nothing about the mass unemployment that is crippling our economy and our society.
So what you need to know is that there is no evidence whatsoever to back these claims. We aren't suffering from a shortage of needed skills; we're suffering from a lack of policy resolve. As I said, structural unemployment isn't a real problem, it's an excuse -- a reason not to act on America's problems at a time when action is desperately needed.

HEADLINE: After a Long Wait, a Critic of Citigroup Wins a Meeting With Top Executives

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Citigroup has decided to embrace the old adage that one should keep friends close -- and enemies even closer.
Top executives at the big bank will sit down this week with Michael Mayo, an outspoken financial analyst who has been publicly denouncing Citigroup. His list of complaints is long. In a recent report titled ''A Matter of Trust,'' he said that meeting the firm's financial targets ''can encourage short-term excesses over long-term prudence'' and he criticized the bank for what he calls aggressive accounting tactics.
''Many of Citi's problems relate to risk management, and there are several red flags,'' he said. 
A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment.
It is common for Wall Street executives to meet with stock analysts from time to time. But Mr. Mayo, who works for Credit Agricole Securities, said that senior Citigroup officers had declined his requests for a meeting for almost two years.
In June, the analyst said, he spotted Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, in the lobby of an office building in Boston and made a beeline toward him.
''He asked me how I was doing, and I said 'Not well, I haven't had a meeting with you in two years.' ''
Mr. Pandit, Mr. Mayo said, looked around ''at his entourage'' and asked if anyone had a problem if he met with Mr. Mayo. No one did, and Mr. Pandit agreed then to see him. ''It was man to man, eye to eye,'' Mr. Mayo said.
Still, he did not hear from Citigroup, and he raised the issue publicly in July on the firm's second-quarter earnings conference call with analysts. On Sept. 10, he heard from the bank, letting him know a date had been set.
The two sides are scheduled to meet on Friday at Citigroup's Midtown Manhattan offices. Both Mr. Pandit and the chief financial officer, John C. Gerspach, will sit down with Mr. Mayo. Mr. Mayo is bringing 10 or so investors with him.
Mr. Mayo already knows what he will be wearing: a dark suit and a tie he bought in Chicago that is blue with some silver strips on the side. ''It is a tie even my secretary thinks is too conservative, so I feel it is perfect for this meeting,'' he said.
It is rare but not unheard-of for companies to shun or even publicly attack the analysts who cover them. Mr. Mayo, 47, himself says he was shut out of Citigroup in 2002 after raising red flags about Citigroup's risk management.
In 1990, in one of the most well-known such dust-ups, an analyst with the brokerage firm Janney Montgomery Scott wrote that Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino would not succeed. Mr. Trump was furious and threatened to sue Janney unless the analyst backed down or Janney fired him. The analyst was fired. In the end, the casino did file for bankruptcy and the analyst later received a financial settlement.
More recently, another prominent bank analyst, Richard X. Bove, was sued by a bank in Florida that accused him of defamation over a report he wrote. The case was settled three months ago.
At the heart of Mr. Mayo's concerns is an accounting issue over something known as a deferred tax asset. Companies with losses may have assets that can be used down the road to reduce their tax obligations on future profits. Citigroup's deferred tax assets are now at $50 billion -- twice as large as those at any other United States corporation, Mr. Mayo says.
He says Citigroup has not taken a write-down on these assets even though other companies in similar positions have done so.
''It is aggressive accounting,'' he said. Citigroup's reluctance to take a write-down, ''is a window into the risk management practices at the company,'' he added. ''It is emblematic of a bigger issue, of being overly aggressive.''
A spokeswoman for the bank said: ''Citi is very comfortable with the recording of our deferred tax assets. We have provided extensive detail on our D.T.A. in various regulatory filings.''
Mr. Mayo has also taken issue with Citigroup's public pronouncement that it plans to increase the assets of its core business over time. ''I think it is inappropriate to list any target based on growth of assets because it is dependent on outside economic forces, which Citi can't control,'' he said.
The Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment.

HEADLINE: From Seat Of Power, Battling Many Crises

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN. 
Steven R. Weisman, a former White House correspondent for The New York Times, is editorial director and public policy fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and editor of the forthcoming ''Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary.''

 BODY:
WHITE HOUSE DIARY
By Jimmy Carter
Illustrated. 570 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30.
Jimmy Carter's first book, ''Why Not the Best?'' -- published in 1976 when he was a long shot running for president -- introduced him charmingly as a born-again Christian, former Georgia governor, former naval officer, Sunday school teacher and peanut farmer. But its frontispiece cast a shadow by quoting the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr: ''The sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.''
That citation was an early sign that Mr. Carter would sometimes bear his presidency like a cross. Indeed, Mr. Carter's 25th book, ''White House Diary,'' the edited and annotated journals of his turbulent years in office, reminds one of the plagues visited on him, many beyond his control, and the way he stumbled, suffered, tried to do the right thing, tried to understand his errors and seemed to believe that politics in a fallen world doomed him to being unappreciated. 
''This may be my last chance to offer an assessment of my time in the White House,'' the nearly 86-year-old former president writes in his afterword. ''Looking back, I am struck by how many unpopular objectives we pursued.'' Even his proudest accomplishments -- the Israel-Egypt peace treaty and getting the hostages seized in Iran home safe -- hardly helped his reputation, he notes, adding: ''I was sometimes accused of 'micromanaging' the affairs of government and being excessively autocratic, and I must admit that my critics probably had a valid point.''
The diaries are not particularly rewarding to read in their entirety, with their endless pages of uninflected entries describing crowds, receptions, appointments and meetings, mixed with asides about his wife, Rosalynn, and his family, mother, jogging, swimming (even skinny-dipping), bowling, fly-fishing and his tennis topspin. In one annotation, Mr. Carter winces that the diary entries do seem self-congratulatory.
The entries also add little of substance that was not in ''Keeping Faith,'' his 1982 memoir. Not surprisingly, its best parts mirror the best parts of that book: his detailed accounts of the hostage crisis; the fateful (and perhaps fatal) decision to fire several cabinet members and lecture the country about a ''crisis of confidence'' in 1979 (the famous ''malaise'' speech, though he never used the word); and of course the negotiations between Israel and Egypt, during which he knelt and prayed when they stalled.
''Keeping Faith'' was criticized as sanctimonious and unreflective, and unfortunately these qualities show up here -- no surprise to those who either love or despise Mr. Carter for his advocacy of negotiating with Hamas and North Korea. Mr. Carter also has a tendency to introduce but not explain certain subjects, understandably in diary entries. The annotations help but are too often self-serving.
Yet patient readers will find ''White House Diary'' fascinating on two levels: the pace gives a sense of what it is like to be president, and the entries contain blunt appraisals of the people with whom he dealt.
Granted, Mr. Carter was singular in his approach to his office. You get an early hint of his problems, for example, when he laments that he is inundated by piles of decision papers. Instead of reorganizing his staff, he decides to take an Evelyn Wood course in speed-reading.
But the journals also intensely reflect the experience of any president being bombarded with one crisis after another. The calamities multiplied for Mr. Carter as the country careened through rising prices, unemployment, gas lines, allies abroad killed or overthrown, hostages in Iran, embassies sacked, nuclear reactors melting down, nuclear arms impasses, the bankruptcy of Chrysler, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
In a familiar pattern for modern Democratic presidents, Republicans charged that Mr. Carter was soft on Russia and on inflation, while on the left Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, led a revolt against his budget cuts, his failure to halt spiraling energy prices -- and eventually his presidency.
You can see how and why Mr. Carter sought comfort in solitary pursuits and in the pleasures of visiting celebrities, from Vladimir Horowitz to Sophia Loren, as well as in family activities, like sledding with his grandchildren and collecting arrowheads with his wife. The diaries are an unusual mix of matters of state and efforts to escape. ''I worked hard all week, some of the most strenuous mental work of my life,'' he writes in 1979, for example, referring to the Camp David meetings to recharge his faltering presidency. ''Also, it's not easy for me to accept criticism, and to reassess my ways of doing things, to admit my mistakes. This was a week of intense reassessment. I ran every day from three to seven miles and swam afterward.''
The obsession with getting away brings bizarre moments, like the time Mr. Carter decides to jog alone on the tow path in Georgetown but gets furious when the Secret Service, stuck in traffic, fails to pick him up at a boathouse, where it is freezing and he has no gloves: ''I stood there about 10 minutes while I fumed, then ran back into town.''
As for Mr. Carter's unvarnished comments on personalities, ''White House Diary'' has already generated some publicity over its harsh view of Senator Kennedy (who died last year), obviously an implicit response to the unkind words about Mr. Carter in Kennedy's posthumous memoir last September.
Mr. Carter notes acidly that Kennedy's ambitious health-care ideas had no chance of passing but was a good issue for him. He asserts that his rival felt entitled to the presidency, but that in their first encounter after Mr. Carter defeated him for the 1980 nomination, Kennedy had been drinking.
Equally unsparing are Mr. Carter's criticisms of Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany and many of his own Congressional allies and members of his cabinet, including Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance.
That the language is blunt and occasionally a little un-Christian may come as a surprise. At a meeting with some lawmakers, ''I told them in a nice way to go to hell.'' A certain Jewish leader ''always acts like an ass.'' Congress is ''just a bunch of disorganized juvenile delinquents.''
''White House Diary'' would have benefited from even more candor. But the writings here reflect the Mr. Carter we know: boastful and painfully confessional, sanctimonious and callous, insightful and un-self-aware. These are the thoughts of a secular preacher and calculating politician, surrounded by friends and yet often alone.

Iraq Waits for Government
More than six months ago, millions of Iraqis cast aside fears about bombs and bullets to vote.

Two divisions of General Motors, Detroit, named agencies to create campaigns aimed at African-Americans. Spending has not been determined. Spike DDB, Brooklyn, will handle those duties for the Chevrolet division, which had not recently had an agency of record for the African-American market. Spike DDB is a joint venture of the filmmaker Spike Lee and DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. And Carol H. Williams Advertising, Emeryville, Calif., and Chicago, will create such campaigns for the Cadillac division, which also had not recently had an agency of record for the African-American market. Williams had previously created ads aimed at black consumers for both Cadillac and Chevrolet. 
Post Foods, part of Ralcorp Holdings, St. Louis, expanded its relationship with the Burns Group, New York, by awarding the agency the lead creative duties for cereal brands like Grape-Nuts, Honey Bunches of Oats and Shredded Wheat. Spending was estimated at more than $90 million. The decision came after Post selected Burns to create campaigns for its Pebbles line of children's cereal. Campaigns for the other cereals had been created by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, New York, part of WPP, when Post was owned by Kraft Foods; Ralcorp acquired Post in 2008.
Sports Authority, Englewood, Colo., named Team Detroit, Dearborn, Mich., part of WPP, as its lead agency. The assignment, with spending estimated at more than $40 million, had been divided between Post Central, Rochester, and Deutsch, New York, part of the Lowe & Partners Worldwide unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, for media planning and buying.
Pinnacle Foods, Mountain Lakes, N.Y., shifted the creative duties for its Birds Eye frozen foods division to TBWA/Chiat/Day, New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, after only two months of working with Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners, New York, part of MDC Partners. Spending was estimated at more than $25 million. ''We were very impressed with the skills and insights of KBS&P throughout the pitch,'' Pinnacle said in a statement. ''However, as sometimes happens, we found the ensuing ongoing relationship to not meet our needs.'' Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal declined to comment.
Brown-Forman Corporation, Louisville, Ky., expanded its relationship with Boxing Clever, St. Louis, by naming it as agency of record for Chambord liqueur and Chambord flavored vodka. Spending was not disclosed. The assignment had been handled by McKinney, Durham, N.C. Boxing Clever is also creating campaigns for two other Brown-Forman brands, Finlandia vodka and Tuaca liqueur.
People
Mike Tesch joined Turkel, Miami, in a new post, creative director, working with Bruce Turkel, partner and executive creative director. He had most recently been creative director at Kelley Swofford Roy, Miami, and before that worked for agencies like Ally & Gargano, New York.
Miscellany
The Rally Marketing Group, Seattle, formed an entertainment and media marketing division. Jack Myers, the media industry analyst and economist, will serve as chairman of the division's advisory board.
Legion Enterprises, New York, which specializes in helping marketers reach men ages 16 to 24 through efforts like social media, was opened in New York by Michael Sepso and Zack Sherman.

HEADLINE: Where the 'Elite' Meet to Read

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The sequel to ''Wall Street'' is subtitled ''Money Never Sleeps.'' Sometimes it seems as if those who write about money never sleep, either.
The media that cover business news and financial markets are busier than a broker's computer during a flash crash as they compete aggressively to woo readers and advertisers.
Examples include the hiring of well-known reporters and editors by the Reuters news service; the introduction of a section devoted to New York by The Wall Street Journal; an expansion of the DealBook blog by The New York Times; a campaign promoting CNBC as ''No. 1 in business news''; redesigns of Forbes magazine and forbes.com; and a transformation of BusinessWeek by its new owner, Bloomberg L.P., into Bloomberg Businessweek.
Bloomberg is not neglecting its other magazine, Bloomberg Markets, which was introduced almost two decades ago as a publication for Bloomberg terminal subscribers. Bloomberg Markets is getting a redesign, effective with the November issue, which is due out on Friday. 
That is to be followed, at the end of the year, by a 12.7 percent increase in the magazine's rate base -- the circulation guaranteed to advertisers -- to 355,000 from 315,000. (It has been a while since a business magazine has raised its rate base amid the challenges the print media are facing.)
And beginning on Monday, Bloomberg Markets will be the subject of a trade campaign -- aimed at decision-makers at media agencies -- that celebrates its readers as the ''global financial elite.'' The campaign, with a budget estimated at more than $500,000, is being created by the New York office of JWT, part of WPP.
Bloomberg selected JWT in February as agency of record for worldwide advertising and marketing. The agency has created some ads for the Bloomberg television and radio units, and a corporate image campaign for the company is in the works.
The Bloomberg Markets campaign is one of several being introduced by magazine publishers. Some on Madison Avenue consider the volume of such campaigns to be an indicator of the health of the ad market: If media companies are chasing ad pages, there must be ad pages to be had.
''We're having a very strong year,'' says Michael Dukmejian, publisher of Bloomberg Markets in New York, citing records for ad pages and ad revenue that are to be set by the November issue.
Among marketers that are new to the ad pages of the magazine so far this year are Allianz, Aston Martin, Goldman Sachs, Gulfstream, Land Rover, Omega, Range Rover, Rolls-Royce, Swiss International Air Lines and, in the corporate category, BlackRock, Sun Life and Toyota Motor.
Still, ''we have a brand-awareness issue outside our core advertising category of financial-services companies,'' Mr. Dukmejian says, so the magazine is eager ''to grow and expand our advertising base.''
Among the categories from which Bloomberg Markets covets business, or additional business, he lists automobiles, ''high-end hotels and resorts,'' jewelry, watches, private aviation, corporate image and technology.
The readers of Bloomberg Markets are about 88 percent male, Mr. Dukmejian says, with a median age of 37 and ''very high household income and net worth.''
Among those who receive the magazine, according to Mr. Dukmejian, are Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and ''every head of a central bank.''
They are ''the movers and shakers of the financial world,'' Mr. Dukmejian says. ''This is really the top of the food chain.''
That inspired the approach for the campaign, describing the magazine's audience as the ''global financial elite.''
''We chose those three words very carefully,'' Mr. Dukmejian says, including ''global'' to highlight that ''more than half our circulation is outside the United States,'' in financial markets like Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London and Tokyo.
As for the idea that the word ''elite'' is too charged to use in an unsettled economy, he replied: ''If they are elite, so be it. That's who they are.''
Labeling the readers of Bloomberg Markets ''elite'' provides an echo of the long-running campaign for The Economist magazine, which portrays its readers as important, affluent and intelligent -- an elite, if you will.
''We want some of their ad categories, absolutely,'' Mr. Dukmejian says, but rejects a suggestion that Bloomberg Markets suffers from ''Economist envy.''
One ad in the campaign shows a man in a dapper suit carrying an umbrella and a copy of Bloomberg Markets. ''The global financial elite have a handbook,'' the headline proclaims.
(If the guy is truly a member of the elite, wouldn't someone be holding the umbrella over him?)
Bloomberg Markets ''graces the desks, briefcases and homes of these highly influential and highly compensated individuals,'' the text of the ad reads. ''They're busy running the financial world and they basically don't read Fortune and Forbes.''
''So if you'd like to talk to the Global Financial Elite, you can talk to them through the magazine they do read: Bloomberg Markets magazine,'' the ad concludes.
A second ad picks up the point about which magazines the readers of Bloomberg Markets do not read. ''Seventy-nine percent of our readers are too focused on leading the financial world to read Forbes,'' the headline proclaims.
''It's difficult getting the attention of the world's financial leaders,'' the text says, describing them as ''focused, driven and incredibly busy.''
''They're captivated by luxury, travel and play, but not that interested in Fortune or Forbes,'' the text continues, then repeats the advice from the previous ad about reaching them ''through the magazine they do read.''
A third ad, depicting a copy of Bloomberg Markets peeking out of a man's expensive-looking briefcase, carries the headline ''The global financial elite don't shop.'' That thought is continued in the text, which begins, ''They buy.''
''So, if you're looking to wow them with a luxury car, catch their eye with a new watch or romance a destination, they're the perfect target audience,'' the text goes on to say.
The ad ends the way the others do, describing how readers of Bloomberg Markets ''basically don't read Fortune and Forbes'' and how they can be reached ''through the magazine they do read.''
The primary challenge, says Tom Christmann, executive creative director at JWT New York, is that ''media buyers and planners think of Bloomberg Markets in the same bucket as Fortune and Forbes and other business magazines.''
They believe ''it's easier to put an ad in Fortune and Forbes and get reach,'' he adds, referring to the larger total circulations of the other magazines.
Another perception the campaign needs to address, Mr. Christmann says, is that some at the media agencies may look askance at Bloomberg Markets because it ''goes free'' to the Bloomberg terminal subscribers.
''But our research shows they read it every month,'' he adds, referring to the subscribers, so any ''stigma'' is unwarranted. (Readers may also subscribe to Bloomberg Markets without subscribing to the terminals and can also buy the magazine on newsstands.)
The campaign seeks to tell the media decision-makers that ''you're getting the cream of the crop'' if you advertise in Bloomberg Markets, Mr. Christmann says, ''the people who don't have time to watch television or read other magazines because they are making money all the time.''
The phrase ''global financial elite'' sounds ''so out of a James Bond movie,'' he adds with a laugh, like ''a financial cabal, or a vast conspiracy to buy really expensive cars and leather goods.''
But ''the 'global financial elite' is something talked about in sales calls'' by the ad staff members at Bloomberg Markets, Mr. Christmann says, ''so we wanted to dovetail with that.''
''Bloomberg is all about data, taking action on a little piece of data,'' he adds in a reference to the information the company provides through its terminals and media properties, so the data that 79 percent of the readers of Bloomberg Markets do not read Forbes or that ''81 percent don't read Fortune'' are meant to spur action in the form of meeting with a member of the Bloomberg Markets ad sales staff or checking out the media kit.
The campaign will appear in ad trade publications like Advertising Age, Adweek, Brandweek, the Asian-Pacific edition of Campaign and Mediaweek. It will, of course, also appear in Bloomberg Markets.
Copies of Bloomberg Magazine will also accompany copies of Advertising Age distributed in the United States and copies of The Internationalist distributed in London and Singapore; the publications are bundled in plastic bags in a practice known as polybagging.
Other steps taken by Bloomberg Markets to woo media agencies involve the hiring of Steve Nazaruk as associate publisher, overseeing marketing, and an expansion of the European ad sales team that included the hiring of Laurie Benson as advertising director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Those additions follow the arrival of Mr. Dukmejian at the magazine last year; he previously worked at SourceMedia and the Fortune and Money Group at Time Inc.

HEADLINE: Making His Name in Buffalo, Paladino Built a Blustery Style

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and MICHAEL BARBARO; David W. Chen, Javier C. Hernandez and Raymond Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When his troubled son spent a night in the Erie County lockup on drunken-driving charges, Carl P. Paladino parked outside the jail and slept in his car, just to be close to him.
When he ran out of patience with Buffalo's failing public schools, he bought time on local radio stations to demand the resignation of the superintendent.
''Hello-o-o-o,'' his booming voice declared in the ads. ''It's time for you to go-o-o-o.''
And when an older man, the lone holdout blocking Mr. Paladino's development of a megastore, refused to sell the house he had lived in for 50 years, Mr. Paladino filed plans to surround the man's home with a sea of asphalt, which officials rejected. 
Mr. Paladino, 64, a rumpled, weary-eyed developer from western New York, seemed to emerge from nowhere to capture the Republican nomination for governor, a political unknown who became a vessel for Tea Party-tinged anger against insiders and incumbents.
But for decades he has been an outsize, impulsive and often outrageous figure: polarizing in his politics, relentless in amassing his real estate empire and irrepressible in seeking to impose his will on civic life.
Interviews with dozens of people who know him -- friends, relatives, admirers and adversaries -- revealed a highly emotional man who oscillates between cursing his enemies and crying over his friends' sorrows, who believes in elbows-out confrontation no matter the cost and whose lifelong dealings with the government have fueled his enormous wealth and his bottomless rage.
By crusading for a series of quixotic causes against the local establishment, Mr. Paladino has frequently been dismissed as little more than a deep-pocketed gadfly. But his rash style and undeniable passion have at times proved to be his biggest assets, and are now propelling him toward a goal that once seemed unthinkable: upsetting Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo to become governor.
A Father's Teachings
Mr. Paladino's father, Belesario, who immigrated to this country from Italy at age 6, raised three children on Buffalo's East Side and became a city water inspector. For the older man, the home was an oasis amid a taxing blue-collar life.
Outside, he felt the sting of anti-Italian discrimination, and he changed his name to Bill. Inside, he spoke in aphorisms about hard work, declaring there was ''no such word as 'can't.' '' And he warned against trusting the slick messages coming out of faraway places like New York City.
The Paladino children, Carl, Joe and Mary Lou, lived in the same two-family house that their father grew up in; their uncle lived in the apartment upstairs.
Carl, the oldest, revered his father, whose second job, selling and repairing medical equipment, paid for the son's parochial school education -- a luxury in their neighborhood -- and for his college tuition.
The thought of his father's humility still chokes up Mr. Paladino. ''On his deathbed, in full hearing of the family,'' he said, his words interrupted by long pauses, ''he looked at me, and he says, 'I'm sorry I can't leave you anything.' ''
His father sent him to St. Bonaventure University, a small Roman Catholic institution 90 minutes south of Buffalo that seemed insulated from the upheaval of the 1960s. Even among his crowd, Mr. Paladino was an admitted square, organizing weekend social events, playing chess into the wee hours and performing drills with his R.O.T.C. unit.
''We really didn't get with that hippie program,'' he said in an interview. ''We had our heads shaved close, and we had a war going on.''
He met his future wife, Mary Catherine Hannon, at one of the events he planned, though their first meeting did not go well. He made a joke about her uncle back in Buffalo, whose indictment was all over the newspapers, and she threw a beer at him. ''It wasn't nice,'' he said of his remark, calling it an early, if unheeded, lesson about keeping ''my big mouth shut.''
After graduating in 1968, he received a deferment to attend Syracuse University College of Law. He drove home each weekend, a 300-mile round trip, to work on a newspaper printing press to help pay for his classes.
Three years later, he traveled with his pregnant wife to Fort Bliss, an Army post in Texas, where he was soon given command of 200 soldiers training for combat in Vietnam, where he expected to be sent. But that September, the orders changed. The American presence in Vietnam was being reduced, and Mr. Paladino's unit would not be deployed.
A day after he learned that, his wife gave birth to a boy.
A Turning Point
Back in Buffalo in late 1971, Mr. Paladino, then 25, began trying to untangle the messy business affairs of his wife's father, Dan Hannon.
Mr. Hannon, a real estate agent, a father of 10 and an organizer of South Buffalo's St. Patrick's Day Parade, had run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service, which imposed heavy assessments and garnished his earnings for several years, Mr. Paladino said. The pressure consumed Mr. Hannon, and he died of a stroke in 1970, at age 51.
Mr. Paladino spent three months examining records before concluding that his father-in-law had been the victim of bogus accusations and an overzealous I.R.S. agent.
''Steam was coming out of my ears,'' he said. ''There was nothing there. They'd killed him, and there were no grounds.''
Mr. Paladino said he called the agent, laid out his findings and threatened to report him to prosecutors. ''There was dead silence, and I realized he was crying,'' Mr. Paladino said.
He said the agent admitted to having overstepped in his pursuit of the case, agreed to remove the assessments hanging over Mr. Hannon's estate and to refund tens of thousands of dollars the agency had seized, and then resigned.
The story could not be verified; Mr. Paladino declined to name the agent. But the lessons from that battle were seared into his memory, he said.
''I learned the need to properly prepare, and to know what you're talking about,'' Mr. Paladino said. ''And the necessity to confront when you're right.''
Mr. Hannon's death proved a major turning point in Mr. Paladino's career. He took over Mr. Hannon's management of the Ellicott Square building, a faded but much beloved grande dame of Buffalo real estate. In 1975, its owners defaulted on their mortgage, and the bank, a subsidiary of J. P. Morgan, kept Mr. Paladino on as manager of the cavernous office building.
He threw out tenants he deemed undesirable and leased the building to 96 percent occupancy, he said. In June 1978, a grateful Morgan executive helped Mr. Paladino put together a partnership to buy the building, and even lent Mr. Paladino the $62,500 for his share, he said.
He had a $500 line of credit on his MasterCharge, two children, an old Mustang and, now, perhaps the most famous building in Buffalo, an Italian Renaissance-style gem that was one of the world's largest when it opened in 1896.
Mr. Paladino's responsibilities and long workdays took a toll. He said he began to suffer anxiety attacks that landed him in the emergency room every few months. Even so, he scarcely slowed down. He bought other downtown buildings at rock-bottom prices: a former bank headquarters, a shuttered department store.
He also began building drugstores for Rite Aid, eventually becoming the company's preferred developer across upstate New York and western Pennsylvania. The cookie-cutter buildings gave Mr. Paladino's company, Ellicott Development, a ready source of profits. He said he built 160 stores, 80 of which he still owns.
But it was as a downtown Buffalo landlord, eventually the city's largest, that Mr. Paladino developed his love-hate relationship with government.
He lavished campaign contributions on city and county leaders, and reaped handsome benefits: appointments to the city parking board and a financial planning commission; and repeated extensions of development deadlines. When he fenced off a city street to use as a parking lot, officials looked the other way. When an out-of-town company was chosen to redevelop a defunct department store, Mr. Paladino somehow wrested the assignment away.
And dozens of local, county, state and federal government agencies filled huge spaces in his office buildings, vastly enhancing the value of his portfolio.
Being a landlord to government tenants also offered him a insider's look at waste and inefficiency. He met state employees with too little work to do and watched offices throw out unused supplies. When the Department of Transportation moved into one of his buildings, it insisted on replacing perfectly good furniture at taxpayers' expense, his brother said.
Mr. Paladino puts the value of his real estate holdings at $500 million and his personal net worth at more than $150 million.
But he has few of the toys that such wealth often allows. He never buys new cars, and though he owns a modest condominium in Boca Raton, Fla., he seldom goes there. His wife often uses the apartment, and Mr. Paladino lends it out to friends, relations, secretaries and other employees so frequently that neighbors call it ''the motel.''
Mr. Paladino does spend his money on meals at some of Buffalo's better restaurants, though the staple in his diet is a dish with local pride: chicken wings (medium hot and crispy).
His extravagances can be as impulsive as his opinions. When he attended a summer wedding at his family's ancestral home in southern Italy and discovered there was no air-conditioning, he said he drove to every appliance shop for miles around, bought up their supply of fans, and handed them out to everyone he saw.
In New Orleans on one of his yearly junkets to the Super Bowl, Mr. Paladino said, he and a friend found that each had an extra ticket. Mr. Paladino said he went to the sidewalk, found a 9-year-old boy with his mother soaking in the pregame excitement and handed them the tickets. His only condition was that they watch the game themselves.
''The kid was just thrilled,'' said the friend, David Rutecki. ''The mother was probably thinking she could sell them for $900 apiece and use the money, but that wasn't what Carl wanted. He wanted to give the kid an experience.''
'The Style of a Bully'
Emboldened by his success in business, Mr. Paladino increasingly made his voice heard in politics. He set his sights on one of Buffalo's most powerful elected officials: James W. Pitts, the city council president, whom he accused of ruling by intimidation.
Mr. Pitts was the ranking black official in Buffalo, and Mr. Paladino's efforts were denounced as an attempt to erode emerging black political power. Undeterred, Mr. Paladino financed repeated charter-reform campaigns that sharply reduced the powers of the office that Mr. Pitts held.
''Anybody that disagrees with him, he's going to try to run over,'' Mr. Pitts said. ''It's the style of a bully.''
In their most memorable exchange, Mr. Pitts, lamenting the lengthening shadow that Mr. Paladino cast over the city, told him, ''You sit on top of the city of Buffalo like a vulture on dry bones.''
At times, Mr. Paladino's rants have had a crazy quality: He once suggested that an aide to Mayor Byron W. Brown would ''soon be frolicking in a prison shower.''
Still, even as he alienated some leaders, Mr. Paladino endeared himself to others. Larry Quinn, a former city development official, remembered receiving a scorching letter from Mr. Paladino, whose name he had not known. So he called him up and told Mr. Paladino he was misinformed. The two went out for beers and became fast friends.
''He's not a crank at all,'' said Mr. Quinn, now a managing partner of the Sabres hockey team. ''You can tell him off, and he's O.K. with it.''
With a higher profile came greater scrutiny. The National Labor Relations Board ruled that Mr. Paladino broke the law by firing a shop steward, interrogating workers and refusing to negotiate a contract with the janitors' union.
In 2000, an Ellicott executive pleaded guilty to a felony, and the company was fined $500,000 over asbestos-removal work in Syracuse. ''Humbling,'' Mr. Paladino called it.
He was not humbled after a roof caved in at an old downtown hotel he was renovating, injuring a worker. When the worker sued, Mr. Paladino, in a deposition, repeatedly referred to the man as a ''moron,'' ignoring a lawyer's pleas to stop using such language.
For a gruff man, he has sometimes been sensitive about his reputation. He sued a free newspaper for $30 million because, he said, ''they make it look like I go around knocking down historic buildings in Buffalo.''
But in 2003, he did just that. After promising to restore a well-known fixture of the city's old waterfront industry, the Harbor Inn, he abruptly razed it on a Saturday morning.
''When you give this guy an inch, he takes a mile,'' said Tim Tielman, a preservationist in the city. ''People weary of fighting, and Carl seems to have boundless energy for the fight, for conflict -- it kind of turns him on.''
In 2005, he finally took up a cause that everyone in Buffalo could agree on. He sued the State Thruway Authority to remove a 75-cent toll on motorists entering the city -- a nuisance with enormous symbolic potency for a city down at its heels, and a burden on poorer commuters. When the toll booths were torn down in 2006, Mr. Paladino at last enjoyed applause from every direction.
But 18 months later, complaining about city schools, he asserted that the superintendent had gotten his job only ''because he was black,'' drawing officials' censure and renewing cries that Mr. Paladino was, simply, racist.
A Family Tragedy
As his public involvement intensified, he was harboring an agonizing secret in his private life: He had had an affair with a female employee, which resulted in a child named Sarah. He had begun to tell his children, but he could not bring himself to inform his wife. ''I adore her,'' Mr. Paladino said. ''I didn't want to bring that hurt.''
His son Patrick, then 29 and struggling with an addiction to drugs and alcohol, proposed a deal: In exchange for his entering a substance-abuse program, his father would have to tell his wife, Cathy, about Sarah, then 9.
Each man kept his end of the bargain, and Sarah, whom Mr. Paladino supports financially, has been fully incorporated into his family.
But in March 2009, a few weeks after leaving rehab, Patrick lost control of his sport utility vehicle on a darkened highway and crashed into a row of trees.
''I was the only person in the room with him when he came to terms with the fact that his son would die,'' Mr. Paladino's brother, Joe, recalled. ''He was on his knees. He was crushed.''
The day of the accident, Mr. Paladino was scheduled to speak at what would have been his first Tea Party rally. He canceled his appearance, but did not stay away for long.
Still grieving but hungry for a distraction, he became a regular at Tea Party events. Taking the microphone in jeans and a T-shirt, he railed against the state's sky-high taxes and bloated bureaucracy, electrifying crowds.
''It was Carl being Carl,'' said Rus Thompson, a Buffalo contractor and Tea Party organizer who convinced Mr. Paladino a few weeks later that an outsider like him could have a shot at governor. ''He said exactly what they were thinking,'' Mr. Thompson added.
The mood of the electorate, furious and fevered, had at last caught up with Mr. Paladino's.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 8, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sept. 27 about Carl P. Paladino and his hometown of Buffalo described a neighborhood in the city incorrectly in some editions. Though Mr. Paladino's father raised his children in a part of the East Side of Buffalo that was heavily Italian, the East Side as a whole was not largely Italian.

Power in the City: Carl P. Paladino, the Republican candidate for governor, is the largest landowner in downtown Buffalo, where real estate comes cheap by New York standards and much of the land has been vacant for years. But the politics can be bruising.: WATERFRONT PLACE: Mr. Paladino received tax breaks for this development under a program intended to encourage development of economically depressed areas. The property features condos selling for $600,000 and higher.
ELLICOTT SQUARE: The skyscraper with the Italian Renaissance-style facade was the nation's largest office building when it was built in 1896, and now serves as headquarters for Mr. Paladino's companies.
50 COURT STREET: The city of Buffalo sold this downtown plot to Mr. Paladino for $700,000, which touched off a bitter legal and political dispute when a competitor's last-minute bid, substantially higher, was rebuffed.
VACANCY: Among the many empty lots that Mr. Paladino owns is this harbor front plot where, in 2003, he caused a stir by tearing down the historic Harbor Inn on a Saturday morning, using a permit obtained Friday afternoon.
SUBSIDIZED: Mr. Paladino built this store on the polluted site of an old gas station in the economically depressed Lower West Side of Buffalo with substantial property tax breaks.

HEADLINE: Liberal Groups Planning to Rally on National Mall

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Hoping to overshadow last month's large rally led by Glenn Beck that drew many Tea Party advocates and other conservatives, a coalition of liberal groups plan to descend on Washington on Saturday to make the case that they, and not the ascendant right, speak for America's embattled middle class.
Predicting a crowd of more than 100,000, some 300 liberal groups -- including the N.A.A.C.P., the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the National Council of La Raza and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force -- are sponsoring a march on Saturday in the hope of transforming the national conversation so it focuses less on the Tea Party. The groups sponsoring the rally, which is called ''One Nation Working Together,'' say they hope to supplant what they say is the Tea Party's divisiveness with a message of unity to promote jobs, justice and education. 
''The Tea Party has been getting much more media attention than it deserves, and it's been saying it represents the voice of middle-class America,'' said George Gresham, president of 1199 S.E.I.U., a New York health care union local, who says his union has chartered 500 buses to carry 25,000 union members to the rally. ''A lot of us feel we have to get a different voice out there speaking for working people, one respecting the diversity of this country, which the Tea Party does not.''
With so many civil rights, labor, religious, student, gay and peace groups sponsoring the march, organizers acknowledge that it was not easy to forge a common platform and message. And sometimes their message has gotten garbled.
Many sponsors say that the rally is not seeking to back President Obama or the Democrats, but rather to hold all of Washington, Democrats and Republicans, accountable for not doing more to fix the nation's problems. But some sponsors sound unmistakably partisan as they denounce ''obstructionism'' in the Senate that has blocked larger job-creation programs and other measures. While these sponsors steer clear of mentioning Republicans, their target seems obvious.
The march's supporters say that they, and not Mr. Beck, are the true descendants of the 1963 March on Washington, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ''I Have a Dream'' speech. The Saturday march, like the 1963 march -- and the Aug. 28 gathering that Mr. Beck and others organized -- will be held on the National Mall in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
''We'll look like the progeny of that march, with our diversity,'' said Benjamin T. Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P. ''We're living through a moment of decreasing prosperity and increasing diversity. That's a formula for a battleground, not common ground. We say, 'Let's get the country moving back to common ground.' ''
Mr. Jealous and Mr. Gresham, the two men who originally proposed the march, say they hope it will be larger than Mr. Beck's rally. ''We believe that our satellite photos will stack up nicely to his satellite photos,'' Mr. Jealous said.
Organizers of the rally say their demonstration complements, rather than competes with, the Rally to Restore Sanity that the host of ''The Daily Show,'' Jon Stewart, has announced for Washington on Oct. 30. Those behind next Saturday's rally assert that their event shares themes with Mr. Stewart's in opposing Tea Party negativism and extremism. Saying he was all for restoring sanity, Mr. Gresham said he would be happy to have Mr. Stewart speak at the event this weekend.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said, ''We hope that those who are supporting Stewart will also join us,'' adding: ''We know what makes the headlines is conflict. We know what we need is to work together to solve problems.''
Mr. Stewart, Mr. Beck and spokesmen for the Tea Party Patriots did not respond to requests for comment.
The rally's platform looks like a liberal wish list: extend unemployment benefits, raise the minimum wage, end the foreclosure epidemic, enact legislation making it easier to join unions, increase infrastructure spending to create jobs, ''fix our broke immigration system'' and end immigration round-ups that ''encourage racial profiling.'' The march's sponsors hope it will help turn some of these wishes into legislative reality, in part by giving the Democrats some highly visible and clamorous backing to push through stalled legislation.
''Our rally is standing up for the change we voted for two years ago,'' Mr. Gresham said.
Janet Murguia, president of National Council of La Raza, said the rally was nonpartisan, although it aims to encourage more people to engage in the electoral process. But Mr. Gresham said he hoped the march would build momentum for candidates who back the demonstrators' goals, and those generally do not include Republican candidates.
The march has been endorsed by the United Church of Christ, the National Baptist Convention and several Jewish organizations, while the United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society has endorsed its principles.
''As people of faith, we deeply care about the issues of justice, education and jobs, and we feel those are issues facing society we have to address,'' said the Rev. Amy Stapleton, a Methodist minister. ''A march like this is something that hasn't been accomplished since Dr. King brought people together in 1963 around issues of race, war, class and the right to decent pay and good jobs.''

HEADLINE: New Labour Leader Looks to 'Middle England'

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- After beating his older brother David Miliband to the Labour Party leadership by a hair's-breadth margin he owed to a left-leaning campaign that won the support of the country's most powerful labor unions, Ed Miliband set out on Sunday to reposition himself as a centrist politician who could lead Labour back to power by winning the backing of middle-class voters who decide elections in Britain.
With some commentators in the Sunday newspapers suggesting that the younger of the Miliband brothers will be a captive of the labor unions on the decisive issues of the next few years, including the sharp public sector cuts planned by Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government, the new Labour leader used a morning television program to rebut critics who have said that, as ''Red Ed,'' a nickname adopted by London's right-wing tabloids, he will be an easy target for the Cameron government. 
''It's not about some lurch to the left, absolutely not,'' Mr. Miliband, 40, said on the Andrew Marr program on the BBC. He described himself as coming from politics' ''center ground.He spoke of his impatience with ''injustices'' in Britain as resonating broadly with ''so-called Middle England,''which he said shared with the poorer sections of British society a concern about losing jobs, homes, and the buttressing features of Britain's welfare state. ''All these characterizations about 'Red Ed', they are both tiresome, and, well, rubbish,'' he said.
Mr. Miliband's central challenge in rebuilding Labour after its heavy defeat in May's general election will be developing a credible policy of opposition to the $135-billion in spending cuts that will detailed next month by the Cameron government, without alienating middle-class support by yielding too readily to assertive union demands for coordinated strikes that would threaten the country with economic chaos. That challenge seemed evident the moment he strode from the conference hall in Manchester on Saturday as the upset winner of what had been a two-man race for the Labour helm.
Having secured the victory on the strength of strong union backing, he was greeted immediately with bear hugs from two of the country's most powerful union leaders. One of them, Tony Woodley, joint leader of Unite, the country's most powerful union, with a broad membership among public sector workers, said Mr. Miliband's triumph was ''a clear sign'' that the party wanted to ''reconnect with the working people'' and to stop ''the assassination of public services.''
Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, another public sector union, concurred. ''We look forward to working together to challenge the coalition government and its regressive cuts agenda,'' he said.
In a complicated series of vote counts that knocked out three other contestants on a round-by-round basis, David Miliband, 45, who as foreign secretary for three years until May's general election was one of the most powerful figures in the Labour government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, lead through three rounds, and seemed on the verge of a triumph that many in Labour had predicted for years. A protege of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, and part of the brain trust that forged the reformist ''New Labour'' movement that propelled Mr. Blair to three successive election victories, he was widely seen as Labour's ''golden boy,'' fated to lead the party into a new era.
Ed Miliband, in Parliament only since 2005, was barely mentioned as a rival to his brother until the four-month leadership campaign was well under way, and polls began to show his strong backing among the unions . The unions are one of three constituencies that combine to choose a new Labour leader. Their voting power is equal to two other blocs, Labour members of the British and European parliaments, and Labour Party members.
The younger brother's popularity with the unions owed much to the fact that he was protege of Mr. Blair's successor, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, an ''Old Labour'' stalwart who was an often-reluctant partner of Mr. Blair in the ''New Labour'' project. Mr. Brown appointed Mr Miliband to the cabinet in 2007, as the minister for energy and climate change .
Mr. Miliband also ran a campaign that appeared to be self-consciously aimed at winning the union vote, with much harsher criticism of the Cameron government's austerity program, which is expected to result in the loss of tens of thousands, possible even hundreds of thousands, of Britain's six million public sector jobs in Britain.
David Miliband, as the campaign front-runner, appeared reluctant to take too aggressive a stance on the government's austerity program, advocating instead a less brutal program to cut the country's $240 billion annual deficit, one that would feature more tax increases and fewer spending cuts than proposed by the ruling Conservatives and their coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.
But that posture, although hailed by many commentators in Britain as the responsible position for a prospective opposition leader to take, ended by costing David Miliband the leadership. In a fourth and final ballot, he lost to his younger brother, 51 percent to 49percent.
Behind that 1 percent margin detailed figures showed how crucial the union vote had been. Although David Miliband led by strong margins among Labour parliamentarians and the broader party membership, Ed Miliband won a 6 percent more of the union vote than his brother, enough to secure his narrow overall win.
The moment of victory appeared to be exquisitely painful for David Miliband, who had maintained a tight but steady smile as the detailed, round-by-round vote tallies were announced, although the five contestants had been told the winner moments before going on stage. When Ed Miliband's victory was confirmed, David Miliband's lips were pursed, and he appeared to be holding back tears.
Both brothers had insisted throughout the campaign that their personal relationship would not be damaged by their political rivalry, but that seemed at times to strain credulity as the two argued against one another, sometimes edgily, during the contestants' 60 public debates across the country. The first words of Mr. Miliband'sacceptance speech seemed like acknowledgment of his bother's pain. ''I love you so much as a brother,'' he said, to waves of applause.
In the BBC interview on Sunday, Mr. Miliband used the occasion to invoke, in a humorous aside, a family history that right-wing critics have adduced as part of their 'Red Ed' attacks -- the fact that the brothers' father, Ralph Miliband, was a Marxist intellectual and writer who reached Britain from Belgium in 1940 after fleeing advancing Nazi forces. Their mother, Marion Kozak, also a left-wing activist, arrived with her family from Poland in the early 1950s. Ralph Miliband is buried beside Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetery here, while his widow, Marion, at 76, remains active in Labour. Although of Jewish descent, both brothers have said that they are non-religious.
True to his Marxist convictions, Ralph Miliband, who died in 1994, was a harsh critic of the parliamentary politics that his sons pursued almost straight out of Oxford University, a fact that has prompted critics of both of brothers to say they lack real-world experience. But Ed Miliband cited his father's disdain for the path the sons chose as proof, in its way, that he is not the arch left-winger critics have suggested. ''My Dad, if he was alive, would say the idea that I was 'Red Ed' is not something he would have recognized,'' he said.
But the coalition government, and particularly the Conservatives, seemed certain to try to paint the new Labour leader into a left-wing corner. Prime Minister Cameron, the 43-year-old Conservative leader, made a congratulatory phone call to the winner shortly after the vote in Mancheser was announced, but in The Daily Telegraph on Saturdayhe suggested he was indifferent to which brother won. ''They're both part of the team that got us into this mess,'' he said, referring to the crushing deficit inherited from 13 years of Labour government under Mr. Blair and Mr.
Brown. ''In this long leadership debate, I haven't heard a single suggestion about how we might deal with the deficit.''
In his acceptance speech, Mr. Miliband said the road back to power ''will not be easy'' for Labour, which has a daunting history of remaining out of power for long periods after election defeats by the Conservatives -- 13 years after Winston Churchill's election victory in 1951, 18 years after Margaret Thatcher's triumph in 1979. He got scant encouragement from Sunday's newspapers in Britain, many of which predicted that Labour could slump in popular support it abandons the centrist, moderate policies it adopted under Mr. Blair.
Some commentators predicted, too, that Mr. Miliband would prove no match for Mr. Cameron in the weekly confrontation of prime minister's questions in the House of Commons, where as opposition leader, Mr. Cameron, a quick and witty debater, often bested PrimeMinister Brown.
''The election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines,'' wrote Jon Rentoul, a columnist in The Independent on Sunday, a newspaper not known for its support of the Conservatives. ''That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event, is going to be roasted every week.''

HEADLINE: Lehman Art Auction Yields $12.3 Million

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Sotheby's held a successful fire sale on Saturday, auctioning art from Lehman Brothers, which declared bankruptcy in 2008, and its money management company Neuberger Berman. Of the 142 works on the block, solid prices were achieved for contemporary artists who either currently have museum exhibitions or are about to - names like Julie Mehretu, John Baldessari and Glenn Ligon. 
An abstract painting from 2001 by Ms. Mehretu, who has shows on view in New York at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Gallery Met, was the top seller, bringing $1 million from an unidentified collector. Other popular artists were Gerhard Richter, whose works-on-paper are on view at the Drawing Center in SoHo, and Mr. Baldessari, whose retrospective has been at the Tate Modern in London and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It is opening next month at the Metropolitan Museum.
The sale's one casualty was ''We've Got Style (The Vessel Collection - Blue/Green)'' from 1993, a cabinet by the British artist Damien Hirst that failed to sell. The blue installation, filled with glass and ceramic objects, is not considered by experts to be the best example of his work. And the $800,000 to $1.2 million estimate was just too high to tempt today's buyers.
Final prices include the buyer's commission to Sotheby's: 25 percent of the first $50,000; 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million; and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions. Proceeds from the sale, which made $12.3 million, will go toward paying off Lehman's creditors.
''In this economy if a sale makes its top estimate,'' said Tobias Meyer, director of the Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide, ''then it's a great success.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Florida Condos Sit Empty, Voters Enter Battle on Growth

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Catharine Skipp contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. -- Lesley Blackner drove through a maze of condominium towers, rarely seeing any curtains in the windows, or residents, and tried to contain her anger.
''They've crammed as much as they can in here,'' she said this month, noting that just a few years ago cows grazed on the land west of I-95. ''The people around here didn't want it -- they objected. But the City Commission did it anyway.''
Even now, with about 300,000 residential units sitting empty around the state, the push to build continues. Since 2007, local governments have approved zoning and other land use changes that would add 550,000 residential units and 1.4 billion square feet of commercial space, state figures show.
So for Ms. Blackner, a Palm Beach lawyer with a Mercedes full of paperwork, the real estate crisis is not just the fault of Wall Street, Washington or misguided borrowers; it is also the back-scratching bond between elected officials and builders -- a common source of frustration in weak real estate markets around the country wherever developers are still fighting to add more housing. 
In Florida, at least, Ms. Blackner hopes to put an end to the chronic oversupply with a ballot initiative she has labeled ''Hometown Democracy.''
Amendment 4, as it is officially called, would give Floridians a vote on changes to state-mandated plans for growth in every county and municipality. Much of the potential impact of the measure is up for debate, with important details most likely to be decided by the courts.
But if it is added to the state's Constitution -- which would require 60 percent approval on Election Day -- critics and supporters envision revolutionary change.
Leaders of the Yes on 4 campaign, including Ms. Blackner, say it would end a culture of freewheeling development that began when Hamilton Disston started dredging Florida swamps in the 1880s. Critics, led by chambers of commerce, say the measure would lead to lost jobs, chaos and expensive court battles.
Either way, the referendum is bringing into sharp relief the conflict surrounding real estate nationwide: while new homes, growth and the American dream are forever intertwined, many people are questioning why development often overwhelms other public priorities, even after it led to an economic crisis.
''Most planning advocates would love to have the structure we have in Florida, but most Floridians know that the structure doesn't work,'' said Michael Allan Wolf, a University of Florida law professor. ''Amendment 4 suggests that, on the ground, this system is really broken.''
This is not an even fight. Ms. Blackner's group has raised $2.4 million (with $800,000 from her own pocket), but most of it was spent on getting on the ballot.
The No on 4 campaign has raised nearly $12 million through a series of political action committees -- enough for a glossy Web site, consultants and plenty of airtime. The Florida Association of Realtors is its largest single contributor, giving more than $2.3 million.
The nation's biggest homebuilders, after receiving a multibillion-dollar bailout from Congress this year, have also been quite generous. Altogether, Lennar Homes, KB Home and Pulte Homes gave more than $1 million to No on 4's main political action committee, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy.
Ryan Houck, a spokesman for the group, said that developers were not the only opponents of the amendment, which he described as ''overreaching and extreme.'' The contributors' list also includes community farm bureaus, which worry that it would make it harder to sell and rezone agricultural land for other uses.
Some county planners are also concerned about potential costs to government. ''The litigation that ensues, no matter what happens, is really the potential fly in the ointment,'' said Mark Satterlee, planning and development director for St. Lucie County.
Amendment 4 leaves open to interpretation whether every proposed change to a community's development plan would need to appear on future ballots. In a sign of possible litigation to come, lawyers favoring the measure say that it would cover only major land use changes and that related proposals could be combined for votes by commissions.
Opponents say that under Amendment 4, each tweak of a development plan -- which every county and municipality must have in place under a state law passed in the mid-1980s, and which requires updating every seven years -- would have to appear on the ballot. Voters, they say, would have hundreds of items to digest each year.
That is not the typical situation. Annual figures from a half-dozen Florida counties and several fast-growing cities suggest that most voters in most years would decide on no more than 20 changes, usually fewer. (The No on 4 Web site says that the small town of Carrabelle would have had 617 proposed changes on its 2006 ballot under such a law, but records and interviews show only a handful of changes proposed that year.)
A more serious issue may be whether the ballot items, which are limited to 75 words or less, would lead to advertising campaigns, followed by misunderstandings and lawsuits. Larger development changes cover complicated issues including water supply and transportation, often with hundreds of pages of material. ''Sometimes we take a hand truck to carry boxes down to the commissioners,'' said Rick Burris, principal planner for Lee County.
However, Mr. Burris added, plan change approvals were not required for building. While developers claim that Amendment 4 would make construction impossible, current community plans around the state actually include robust expansion.
A rural area like Jackson County has room for 996 years of residential growth at current rates, according to a 2009 state analysis. Charlotte County has 162 years of growth in its plan, while St. Lucie County has the capacity to house its growing population for the next 212 years.
And that is what gets Ms. Blackner really fuming. ''They could build until hell freezes over,'' she said during a daylong tour of failed developments. ''This isn't about building. It's about control.''
She drove past a row of empty condos on Route 1 called the Preserve, then past commercial and residential space, all vacant concrete floors and for-rent signs; then more examples of what she called the political class's addiction to the next deal -- apartment towers with few occupants, several stories higher than the plans' original limits.
Finally she arrived at Tesoro, a golf community in the City of Port St. Lucie with a $48 million San Simeon-like clubhouse. The city's mayor resigned and was arrested last Wednesday, on charges of pocketing campaign contributions, including money from developers. Tesoro -- former scrub brush -- is now an eerie ghost town of minicastles with fewer than 100 residents.
''This is bubble grandeur,'' Ms. Blackner said, noting that Port St. Lucie's taxpayers were left to pay for a new firehouse in the development.
''The commissioners were supposed to be protecting the community,'' she said. ''That's their job, and they were asleep at the switch.''

HEADLINE: A Rich Foothold At a High Price

BYLINE: By ROB COX and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
Wal-Mart has finally sounded the vuvuzela on African expansion. After months of speculation about how it would try to capitalize on the continent's growth, the retailer is offering $4.2 billion to acquire South Africa's Massmart Holdings. The price could grate on shareholders' ears. But the deal gives Wal-Mart a local vehicle -- and local knowledge -- to help it gain access to a market with a profile that should suit it well.
If the deal is accepted by Massmart, Wal-Mart will be paying close to 13 times the Johannesburg-based retailer's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. For a company that trades at closer to 7 times Ebitda, that's a big premium, albeit a drop in the bucket against Wal-Mart's nearly $200 billion market capitalization. 
But Wal-Mart will get a foothold in what should be a bright spot in the world's growth map. South Africa, where Massmart operates 232 stores from Limpopo in the northeast to the Western Cape, is one of the Civets economies (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa) widely hailed as the next sizable emerging markets.
The International Monetary Fund estimates sub-Saharan output will grow nearly 6 percent a year from 2011. Capitalizing on that would be a stretch for Wal-Mart from its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters.
Piggybacking on Massmart's business makes African expansion much less risky. From its home market where it operates various retail formats, the South African group has been rolling out its Game mass-discount stores in Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and elsewhere.
Moreover, buying Massmart should improve margins in Wal-Mart's international business, which accounts for about a quarter of its revenue. While Wal-Mart International's operating margins were about 3.8 percent in the first half of this year, Massmart's stood at closer to 5 percent. Apply Wal-Mart's huge purchasing power, and profitability could increase further.
This entry ticket to a Civets lair doesn't come cheap. But with growth elusive at home, it should be a price Wal-Mart shareholders are happy to pay.
Tough A.I.G. Exit
There's no quick way for the federal government to exit American International Group. Converting $49 billion of preferred stock to common shares and selling them would, like the exit from Citigroup, take time. And that's assuming other share sales, needed for separate repayments relating to A.I.G., go smoothly.
As of June 30, A.I.G. owed the government just over $100 billion. A.I.G. has also made progress offloading assets. Big examples include the initial public offering of A.I.A., the Asian unit currently expected to begin trading on the Hong Kong market in the next month or so, and the pending $15.5 billion sale to MetLife of American Life Insurance, or Alico. The New York Fed converted debt in those entities into preferred shares worth $16 billion and $9 billion respectively, and the deals will help pay that off.
Back at A.I.G. itself, there are about $49 billion of preferred shares owned by the Treasury. The Citi example shows how those securities might be swapped into common equity and then sold, over time. In the Citi case, the government is turning a profit on its shares, potentially making the idea interesting for A.I.G. as well.
But it seems that selling the government's Citi stake -- initially nearly 30 percent -- will take longer than anticipated. Offloading the A.I.G. stake could take far longer, because the government already effectively owns 80 percent of the company. Converting the preferreds could take that nearer to 90 percent.
That's not all. An AIA I.P.O. probably won't raise enough to repay the New York Fed's preferred interest right away, let alone give A.I.G. proceeds to apply to its own obligations. Meanwhile the Alico sale will come with only $6.8 billion of cash. So the government will depend on further sales of AIA and MetLife equity interests to get repaid.
Furthermore, ahead of all that is another $20 billion or so, including interest, that A.I.G. still owes the New York Fed under a credit facility. The insurer might at some point be able to refinance that. But put the pieces together, and taxpayers could wait a long time before enough shares in enough different companies are sold for them to be made whole.

HEADLINE: Tech Firms Resist India On Software Code Secrets

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and IAN AUSTEN; Vikas Bajas reported from New Delhi and Ian Austen from Ottawa.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- In the last year, the Indian government surprised foreign telecommunications equipment suppliers like Huawei, Alcatel-Lucent and Cisco Systems by temporarily blocking the import of new network gear.
The government said it needed to set up a procedure to detect any software embedded in the machines that could be used by foreign governments to spy on or otherwise harm India. Many orders for equipment were stalled for several months and gear from Chinese vendors has been held up for much of the year.
India has loosened restrictions on equipment imports. The country is no longer blocking the imports altogether, but is now requiring equipment makers to obtain government clearance on a case-by-case basis. Or vendors can agree instead to several conditions including depositing source code -- the underlying software instructions for the equipment -- with the government, as well as having the equipment tested by independent consultants. 
''This code is the secret sauce,'' said an executive with a Western telecom vendor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his firm does not publicly discuss negotiations with governments. ''That's why companies are hesitant to do it. Companies invest billions of dollars in research to come up with innovative ways to develop infrastructure, and they're just asking to have it.''
Handing over that vast amount of data, that executive and others in the industry said, may also violate American technology transfer laws for software developed in the United States, as well as software licensing agreements the equipment makers have made with other companies.
In a letter to the government last month, the American Chamber of Commerce in India, whose members include Motorola and Cisco Systems, warned that the new rules were ''severely affecting the ability of American as well as other global companies to do business in the telecom sector in India and also the growth of India's telecom industry.''
Industry officials say India is particularly concerned about the import of equipment made by Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE, which India fears have close ties with the Chinese government. India and China have long had an uneasy relationship, including border disputes unsettled since a 1962 war, and India chafes under China's dominance of trade between the countries.
India is not alone in its wariness of Chinese companies. Lawmakers in Washington have tried to block the use of telecom equipment from China on national security grounds. An American government panel blocked Huawei's joint bid with Bain Capital to acquire 3Com in 2008.
In an interview, Gopal Krishna Pillai, secretary of the Home Ministry, said the rules were not meant to single out China. He said that India had found some imported equipment that contained malicious software, but he declined to disclose details.
Global concerns about the threat of sophisticated malware were also raised by reports that Iranian computers and industrial equipment may have been the target of a malicious computer program, known as the Stuxnet worm, that was created by a foreign government.
Sachin Pilot, India's junior minister for communications, defended his government's policy, which he said would be streamlined soon, as justified on security grounds. And he said that India imported $20 billion of telecom equipment a year for its wireless networks, some of which were owned by foreign companies like Vodafone of Britain.
''It is a little unjustified when someone raises a question on the openness of the Indian economy and the telecom space,'' he said in an interview at his home in New Delhi. ''We have allowed competition. We have allowed openness.''
Notably, Huawei and ZTE, operating under the new rules, have recently won contracts to supply third-generation wireless gear to Indian companies.

HEADLINE: A Candidate's Lawn Signs Constitute a Rare Boom in Buffalo

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BUFFALO
All day long, Laurie Kostrzewski, the receptionist at Carl P. Paladino's campaign headquarters in downtown Buffalo, bears the burden of turning people away. They want Paladino lawn signs; she has been out of them since Mr. Paladino won the Republican primary for governor of New York. Perhaps this reflects some general disorganization of the campaign; perhaps it reflects unexpected demand.
Of the 200 or so calls the office receives each day, Ms. Kostrzewski estimated, about half are for this elusive hot ticket, apparently a popular accessory in some parts of New York where people actually have lawns. 
On Friday, while I was waiting to interview Mr. Paladino's wife, Cathy, for my previous column, a man wandered in asking for such a sign, despite the large clear printed note posted on the door outside: ''Sorry. We are completely out of lawn signs until the week of October 1!'' The ''sorry'' was written in oversize letters -- this is the only kind of apology politicians are eager to make.
On the wall near Ms. Kostrzewski's desk were several cartoons, one of which depicted an old man. ''At my age, I don't miss sex,'' the caption read. In crude language, the cartoon explained, the man gets that service provided by the state.
That day, downtown Buffalo, gutted in recent decades by greener suburban grass and the closing of the nearby steel mills, was itself a kind of sign of the times, perhaps emblematic of some of the desperation and anger upstate that Mr. Paladino seems to have tapped. A 10-minute walk from Paladino headquarters, and on the same block of Main Street as the Hyatt Regency hotel, a strip of empty storefronts spoke silently of the upstate New York that time forgot: For sale, for lease, reduced, the stickers begged. Rose Nails, Buffalo Beauty Supply, Mr. D's Fashion Corner for Tots to Teens, J. P. Fashions -- all were empty, and looked, from their lettering, as if they might have been for the past 40 years.
At the abandoned Happy Garden Chinese Fast Food restaurant, the red lacquer doors were swung open, as if the last owners could not be bothered to close them on the way out. Cobwebs on a metal gate surrounding the restaurant flickered whenever the day's hot, strange wind blew.
A few blocks down, the bell of the light rail -- the great hope of industrial town revitalizations everywhere -- gave a muted clang. A man in a wheelchair stopped to rattle a plastic cup at a man sitting on the sidewalk, his back slouched up against the glass of yet another empty storefront. The two men stared dully at each other before the first moved on.
NEARBY, inside a Rite Aids, the talk was of an attempted holdup down the street at the Citizens Bank. ''A woman, she just jumped right over the counter,'' the man behind me in line said he had heard. Later, I ran into a tourist from Australia, who had seen the police cars screeching up to the bank just as the walking tour he was taking passed by the building. ''They'll do anything for us tourists,'' he said.
He and his wife were making an ''off-the-beaten-path'' tour of New York, he said. Here in western New York, they were getting an eyeful of a different world than they would in Times Square or even in bustling Albany.
On his walking tour, the Australian was told that Buffalo used to have more millionaires per capita than any other city. In taxis, both of us heard similar stories of the city's decline: that the population had fallen to 270,000 from 580,000, and that the economic situation, as my driver put it, was ''desperate.''
Back at Mr. Paladino's office, Ms. Kostrzewski continued to take calls, her voice friendly but firm. ''We should have them by October 2nd or 3rd,'' she was telling someone. ''Call us back then. Will you be needing a bulk delivery? O.K., we can arrange that.'' In the back of the office, another woman's voice was saying the same thing: ''Can you try us back the first week of October? We should have them by then.'' Ms. Kostrzewski took another call for the signs, giving me a wink.
Campaign officials said they had already given out 50,000 of the signs, and had ordered 50,000 more.
As I headed out to the train station in suburban Depew, past what looked like empty warehouses, their shattered half-windows reflecting some morning light, I glimpsed a sign, large and looming in its Halloween colors, plastered on the side of a hulking building: Paladino for the People.
''I don't usually vote, but this year I'm going to,'' my cabdriver said. ''He'll rattle some cages.''
Correction: October 8, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Big City column on Sept. 28, about the city of Buffalo and Carl P. Paladino's campaign for governor, referred incorrectly to a Rite Aid store where people were discussing a recent holdup. The drugstore is not one of the many Rite Aid stores Mr. Paladino developed for the company.

HEADLINE: Privacy vs. National Security

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and IAN AUSTEN; Vikas Bajaj reported from New Delhi, and Ian Austen from Ottawa. Heather Timmons contributed reporting from New Delhi.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- In the United States, law enforcement and security agencies have raised privacy concerns with a new proposal for electronic eavesdropping powers to track terrorists and criminals and unscramble their encrypted messages.
But here in India, government authorities are well beyond the proposal stage. Prompted by fears of digital-era plotters, officials are already demanding that network operators give them the ability to monitor and decrypt digital messages, whenever the Home Ministry deems the eavesdropping to be vital to national security.
Critics, though, say India's campaign to monitor data transmission within its borders will hurt other important national goals: attracting global businesses and becoming a hub for technology innovation.
The most inflammatory part of the effort has been India's threat to block encrypted BlackBerry services, widely used by corporations, unless phone companies provide access to the data in a readable format. But Indian officials have also said they will seek greater access to encrypted data sent over popular Internet services like Gmail, Skype and virtual private networks that enable users to bypass traditional telephone links or log in remotely to corporate computer systems. 
Critics say such a threat could make foreigners think twice about doing business here. Especially vulnerable could be outsourcing for Western clients, like processing medical records or handling confidential research projects, information that is typically transmitted as encrypted data.
''If there is any risk to that data, those companies will look elsewhere,'' said Peter Sutherland, a former Canadian ambassador to India who is now a consultant to North American companies doing business there.
S. Ramadorai, vice chairman of India's largest outsourcing company, Tata Consultancy Services, echoed that sentiment in a newspaper column on Wednesday. ''Bans and calls for bans aren't a solution,'' he wrote. ''They'll disconnect India from the rest of the world.''
Few doubt that India has valid security concerns. In recent years, attacks against India have included the use of sophisticated communications technology -- as when the terrorists who stormed Mumbai two years ago communicated with their Pakistani handlers by satellite phone and the Internet. Or when Chinese hackers infiltrated India's military computer networks this year.
But critics say that India's security efforts, which they describe as clumsy, may do little to protect the country, even as they intrude on the privacy of companies and citizens alike.
''They will do damage by blocking highly visible systems like BlackBerry or Skype,'' said Ajay Shah, a Mumbai-based economist who writes extensively about technology. ''This will shift users to less visible and known platforms. Terrorists will make merry doing crypto anyway. A zillion tools for this are freely available.''
Senior Indian officials, though, argue that they have no choice but to demand the data that could help thwart and investigate terrorist attacks.
''All communications which is done by Indians or coming to and fro into India -- and where we have a concern about national security -- we should have access to it,'' said Gopal Krishna Pillai, the secretary of India's Home Ministry, which oversees domestic security.
During the Mumbai attacks, he said, officials could not gain access to some of the communications between the terrorists and their handlers.
Some legal experts indicate that Indian law -- which has few explicit protections for personal privacy -- is on the government's side. But they also say India is trying to enforce the law in unnerving ways.
''The concern of corporate users and general users of BlackBerry is that if this is allowed, the government will become the single biggest repository of information,'' said Pavan Duggal, a technology lawyer who practices before India's Supreme Court. ''And we have no idea how this information will be used and misused in the future.''
The Indian government has also clamped down on the importation of foreign telecommunications equipment, saying it wants to ensure that the technology does not contain malicious software or secret trap doors that could be used by foreign spies.
The technology and security debates playing out here are not new or unique to India.
During the 1990s, for instance, American security officials tried unsuccessfully to restrict the use of encryption because of worries that law enforcement would not be able to monitor communications. Now, in legislation the Obama administration plans to introduce next year, officials want Congress to require all services that enable communications -- including encrypted e-mail systems like BlackBerry, social networking Web sites like Facebook and software that allows direct ''peer to peer'' messaging like Skype -- to be technically able to comply if served with a wiretap order.
Currently, other countries including the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia are trying to impose various measures similar to India's.
The debate here, though, is complicated by the fact that despite private industry's technology prowess in this country, in technologies like cryptography Indian law enforcement agencies still lag significantly behind their counterparts in the United States and other advanced countries.
The Indian government says it is intent on improving its code-cracking skills. But ''in the interim, it has this very blunt instrument,'' said Rajan S. Mathews, the director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, a trade group. ''It comes to the operators and says: 'I'm going to make you responsible for giving me access,' '' he said.
Mr. Pillai, the Home Ministry secretary, said the government was not opposed to the use of encryption to protect the privacy of legitimate electronic communications. But he said that as government-licensed entities, network operators were obliged to give law enforcement officials a way to decode messages when required or to block communications that they cannot decipher.
But network providers say they may not always have the technical ability to do that. In much of the world -- including for business users in India -- companies and individuals now often use encryption systems that generate new code keys for each message and lack a convenient master key that could unlock everything for government viewing.
Google, for its part, has enhanced the encryption for its Gmail service, making it harder for hackers and the Indian government to read messages. Mr. Pillai said his ministry had begun conversations with Google and Skype, the Internet phone company, which also uses strong encryption, to provide access to decoded data.
Representatives for Google and Skype said that they could not comment because they had not yet received formal demands from the Indian government.
Meanwhile, government officials have demanded that the maker of BlackBerry, Research In Motion of Canada, set up a server computer in India from which law enforcement agencies can gain access to unencrypted versions of messages when they need to. The government has given R.I.M. until the end of October to comply.
The company has said that it is willing to meet ''the lawful access needs of law enforcement agencies.'' But the company says it cannot provide unencrypted copies of messages of corporate users because of how the BlackBerry system is designed, noting that even R.I.M. cannot decode them.
''Strong encryption has become a mandatory requirement for all enterprise-class wireless e-mail services today,'' R.I.M. said in a statement in late August, ''and is also a fundamental commercial requirement for any country to attract and maintain international business.''

HEADLINE: Zeal for Dream Drove Scientist In Secrets Case

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Many people who know P. Leonardo Mascheroni describe him as a maverick and a technology zealot. Now, the Justice Department will try to prove that he is dangerous, too -- a man willing to sell atomic secrets in exchange for a chance to realize his dream.
Dr. Mascheroni, 75, is a nuclear scientist who has spent the 22 years since he left the Los Alamos National Laboratory trying to sell Congress, the scientific community, journalists -- anyone who would listen, really, including this reporter -- on his plan to build a giant laser for the achievement of nuclear fusion.
His plan earned respect and high-level endorsements, but the government chose a different path. Rather than give up, Dr. Mascheroni redoubled his campaign, sending out lengthy technical documents from his home in New Mexico to try to coax Washington to finance his laser.
''You'd get these fat FedEx packages,'' said Steven Aftergood, a security expert at the Federation of American Scientists. 
As he was snubbed by Congress and federal experts, Dr. Mascheroni, a naturalized citizen who was born in Argentina, grew increasingly frustrated and bitter. He became known in Washington for veiled threats to take his atomic expertise abroad unless the government backed his laser plan. He seemed to think that he could bully the federal establishment into big spending, according to people on the receiving end of his missives.
''He came at you like a force of nature,'' recalled Matthew G. McKinzie, a former Los Alamos researcher who is now at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group in Washington. ''He and his coterie of followers at Los Alamos believed his approach could provide a source of limitless, clean energy for humanity.''
A 22-count indictment against Dr. Mascheroni, made public on Sept. 17, quotes his wife, Marjorie, as saying that he would ''make bombs'' overseas ''if they don't listen to him in Washington.'' She has been charged as a co-conspirator, and both of them have pleaded not guilty.
Dr. Mascheroni's world began to crumble last October, when federal agents raided his home in Los Alamos, hauling away his computers and hundreds of paper files. When reached by phone, he said at the time that he was suspected of treason.
Clearly rattled, Dr. Mascheroni declared his innocence. He defended his actions, including his interactions with the man who had represented himself as a Venezuelan contact but who Dr. Mascheroni by then suspected -- correctly -- was actually an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
''It was a way of getting attention in Congress'' and trying to prompt hearings on Capitol Hill about the nation's fusion program, he said of his decision to talk with the would-be foreigner.
''I told them, 'If you don't have hearings, I'm going to leave,' '' he said. ''And they didn't have hearings.''
Dr. Mascheroni conceded that the man had promised him a lot of money, but insisted that he wanted it simply ''to make a big case. It was political leverage. That's the bottom line.''
''If I were a real spy, I would have left the country a long time ago,'' he added.
Federal prosecutors have charged Dr. Mascheroni with trying to sell nuclear secrets to Venezuela as part of a complicated scheme to have that country bring his laser to life. According to the indictment, he negotiated the deal in 2008 and 2009 with the undercover F.B.I. agent, who paid him $20,000 out of an overall promise of nearly $800,000.
The laser that Dr. Mascheroni wants to build could provide -- in theory -- an unusual but potentially limitless source of energy for the world, and in particular for the United States, his adopted home.
In the October phone interview, Dr. Mascheroni drew parallels between his own idealism and that of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Los Alamos team that built the world's first atom bomb but later tried to slow the arms race.
''I have to put my science at a higher level,'' he said, emphasizing that his responsibilities to the scientific truth extended beyond duties to care for his family. He suggested that he even might face a death sentence.
The couple have a son, who is a firefighter in Idaho, and a daughter, who is a lawyer in California. Mrs. Mascheroni lost her job at Los Alamos the day of the federal raid, and neither she nor her husband has agreed to an interview since they were indicted.
Dr. Mascheroni, who is known as Leo, was trained at a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. At Los Alamos, he was exposed to information on nuclear arms and worked on teams that sought to make energy advances.
In 1988, after nine years at the weapons lab, he left and embarked on a personal crusade to achieve what had eluded thousands of other scientists: a controlled version of nuclear fusion, the violent process that powers the Sun, the stars and hydrogen bombs. His proposal -- the use of a big laser -- was considered among the most futuristic of the alternatives on the table.
Skeptical of federal plans for laser fusion, he promoted his own as cheaper, faster and far more likely to succeed. Its wavelength was much longer, and its blasts of concentrated light far easier to achieve. He dismissed resistance to his plan as an overzealous commitment to the status quo.
''It's a cultural thing,'' he told The New York Times in 1988. ''They don't want to admit something different.''
He won guarded approval. A Los Alamos panel led by Gregory H. Canavan, a respected senior scientist, found Dr. Mascheroni's idea worth exploring. The main attraction, the panel said, was that his laser system might prove to be as little as one-twentieth the cost of its rivals.
''It's very important for our country to have this option for the future,'' Dr. Mascheroni said in a 1989 interview. ''The other approaches are not going to work.''
After leaving the weapons lab, Dr. Mascheroni toiled on his pet project without pay, relying on his wife to provide most of the family's income. Her jobs at Los Alamos included technical writing and editing.
Dr. Mascheroni, meanwhile, persistently lobbied the Capitol for his laser plan. In 2003, for example, he wrote to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had just become chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The letter was 319 pages long, and Dr. Mascheroni sent copies to relevant experts outside of Congress.
Despite his rebel status and impolitic ways, he was often taken seriously. He won the backing of a former Central Intelligence Agency director, R. James Woolsey, who helped him promote his vision. Ultimately, however, the nation chose a more elaborate laser path.
That did not stop Dr. Mascheroni. The indictment against him describes clandestine meetings, tape-recorded conversations, confidential places for the transfer of documents and a pattern of false statements from Dr. Mascheroni and his wife to federal authorities.
As part of the plot, prosecutors say, Dr. Mascheroni would build a laser for producing energy -- as he had always wanted to -- and would throw in a plan for Venezuela that ''could deliver a nuclear bomb in 10 years.''
Lawyers in the case say that a trial may not get started until the middle of next year. If found guilty, Dr. Mascheroni and his wife could face up to life in prison.
As Dr. Mascheroni sits in a halfway house in Albuquerque awaiting trial, the rival laser that he criticized for so many years now looms over a small California town. The size of a football stadium, the $3.5 billion site is known as the National Ignition Facility. It is the world's most powerful assemblage of lasers, their concentrated light like a tiny star. The 192 lasers fire in unison on flecks of hydrogen fuel smaller than a match head.
Skeptics dismiss the facility as a colossal delusion that is squandering precious resources -- $140 million a year -- at a time of economic hardship. But scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, its home, insist that the laser is making great progress toward its goal.
Hugh E. DeWitt, a California physicist and veteran of the Livermore lab, suggested that Dr. Mascheroni, in approaching a man he thought was a Venezuelan agent, was probably overselling his bomb skills in an last-ditch attempt to bring his laser to life.
''He was never particularly interested in nuclear weapons,'' recalled Dr. DeWitt, who attended Dr. Mascheroni's wedding. ''His interest was in laser fusion.''
But Dr. Mascheroni's fixation on the giant laser transformed him into ''a gullible nut,'' one who readily stumbled into the F.B.I.'s trap, Dr. DeWitt said, adding: ''He has dug his own grave.''

HEADLINE: 4,100 Massachusetts Students Prove Small Isn't Always Better

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
BROCKTON, Mass. -- A decade ago, Brockton High School was a case study in failure. Teachers and administrators often voiced the unofficial school motto in hallway chitchat: students have a right to fail if they want. And many of them did -- only a quarter of the students passed statewide exams. One in three dropped out.
Then Susan Szachowicz and a handful of fellow teachers decided to take action. They persuaded administrators to let them organize a schoolwide campaign that involved reading and writing lessons into every class in all subjects, including gym.
Their efforts paid off quickly. In 2001 testing, more students passed the state tests after failing the year before than at any other school in Massachusetts. The gains continued. This year and last, Brockton outperformed 90 percent of Massachusetts high schools. And its turnaround is getting new attention in a report, ''How High Schools Become Exemplary,'' published last month by Ronald F. Ferguson, an economist at Harvard who researches the minority achievement gap. 
What makes Brockton High's story surprising is that, with 4,100 students, it is an exception to what has become received wisdom in many educational circles -- that small is almost always better.
That is why the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the last decade breaking down big schools into small academies (it has since switched strategies, focusing more on instruction).
The small-is-better orthodoxy remains powerful. A new movie, ''Waiting for Superman,'' for example, portrays five charter schools in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere -- most with only a few hundred students -- as the way forward for American schooling.
Brockton, by contrast, is the largest public school in Massachusetts, and one of the largest in the nation.
At education conferences, Dr. Szachowicz -- who became Brockton's principal in 2004 -- still gets approached by small-school advocates who tell her they are skeptical that a 4,100-student school could offer a decent education.
''I tell them we're a big school that works,'' said Dr. Szachowicz, whose booming voice makes her seem taller than 5-foot-6 as she walks the hallways, greeting students, walkie-talkie in hand.
She and other teachers took action in part because academic catastrophe seemed to be looming, Dr. Szachowicz and several of her colleagues said in interviews here. Massachusetts had instituted a new high school exit exam in 1993, and passing it would be required to graduate a decade later. Unless the school's culture improved, some 750 seniors would be denied a diploma each year, starting in 2003.
Dr. Szachowicz and Paul Laurino, then the head of the English department -- he has since retired -- began meeting on Saturdays with any colleagues they could pull together to brainstorm strategies for improving the school.
Shame was an early motivator, especially after the release of the 1999 test scores.
''They were horrible,'' Dr. Szachowicz recalled. She painted them in bold letters on poster paper in the group's Saturday meeting room.
''Is this the best we can be?'' she wrote underneath.
The group eventually became known as the school restructuring committee, and the administration did not stand in the way. The principal ''just let it happen,'' the Harvard report says.
The committee's first big step was to go back to basics, and deem that reading, writing, speaking and reasoning were the most important skills to teach. They set out to recruit every educator in the building -- not just English, but math, science, even guidance counselors -- to teach those skills to students.
The committee put together a rubric to help teachers understand what good writing looks like, and began devoting faculty meetings to teaching department heads how to use it. The school's 300 teachers were then trained in small groups.
Writing exercises took many forms, but encouraged students to think methodically. A science teacher, for example, had her students write out, step by step, how to make a sandwich, starting with opening the cupboard to fetch the peanut butter, through washing the knife once the sandwich was made. Other writing exercises, of course, were much more sophisticated.
Some teachers dragged their feet. Michael Thomas, now the district's operations director but who led the school's physical education department at the time, recalled that several of his teachers told him, ''This is gym; we shouldn't have to teach writing.'' Mr. Thomas said he replied, ''If you want to work at Brockton High, it's your job.''
Fear held some teachers back -- fear of wasting time on what could be just another faddish reform, fear of a heavier workload -- and committee members tried to help them surmount it.
''Let me help you,'' was a response committee members said they often offered to reluctant colleagues who argued that some requests were too difficult.
The first big boost came with the results of the spring 2001 tests. Although Brockton's scores were still unacceptably low, they had risen sharply. The state education commissioner, David P. Driscoll, traveled to Brockton to congratulate the school's cheering students and faculty.
''It had become dogma that smaller was better, but there was no evidence,'' said Mr. Driscoll, who since 2007 has headed the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees federal testing. ''In schools, no matter the size -- and Brockton is one of the biggest -- what matters is uniting people behind a common purpose, setting high expectations, and sticking with it.''
After that early triumph, remaining resistance among the faculty gave way, Dr. Szachowicz said. Overnight, the restructuring committee gained enormous credibility, and scores of once-reluctant teachers wanted to start attending its Saturday meetings, which continue today.
Brockton never fired large numbers of teachers, in contrast with current federal policy, which encourages failing schools to consider replacing at least half of all teachers to reinvigorate instruction.
But Dr. Szachowicz and her colleagues did make some teachers uncomfortable, and at least one teacher who refused to participate in the turnaround was eventually dismissed after due process hearings.
Teachers unions have resisted turnaround efforts at many schools. But at Brockton, the union never became a serious adversary, in part because most committee members were unionized teachers, and the committee scrupulously honored the union contract.
An example: the contract set aside two hours per month for teacher meetings, previously used to discuss mundane school business. The committee began dedicating those to teacher training, and made sure they never lasted a minute beyond the time allotted.
''Dr. Szachowicz takes the contract seriously, and we've worked together within its parameters,'' said Tim Sullivan, who was president of the local teachers union through much of the last decade.
The committee changed many rules and policies.
The school had an elaborate tracking system, for instance, that channeled students into one of five academic paths. It was largely eliminated because the ''basic'' courses set low expectations for poor-performing students.
The committee worked to boost the aspirations of students, 69 percent of whom qualify for free lunches because of their families' low incomes. Teachers were urged to make sure students heard the phrase, ''When you go to college ...'' in every class, every day.
When the school began receiving academic awards, they were made into banners and displayed prominently.
Athletics had traditionally been valued above academic success, and coaches had routinely pressured teachers to raise the grades of star players to maintain their eligibility. Dr. Szachowicz said she put an end to any exceptions.
But the school retained all varsity sports, as well as its several bands and choruses, extensive drama program and scores of student clubs.
Many students consider the school's size -- as big as many small colleges -- and its diverse student body (mostly minority), to be points in its favor, rather than problems.
''You meet a new person every day,'' said Johanne Alexandre, a senior whose mother is Haitian. ''Somebody with a new story, a new culture. I have Pakistani friends, Brazilians, Haitians, Asians, Cape Verdeans. There are Africans, Guatemalans.''
''There's a couple of Americans, too!'' Tercia Mota, a senior born in Brazil, offered. ''But there aren't cliques. Take a look at the lunch table.''
''You can't say, those are the jocks, those are the preppy cheerleaders, those are the geeks,'' Ms. Mota said. ''Everything is blended, everybody's friends with everyone.''
Over the years, Brockton has refined its literacy curriculum. Bob Perkins, the math department chairman, used a writing lesson last week in his Introduction to Algebra II class. He wrote ''3 + 72 - 6 x 3 - 11'' on the board, then asked students to solve the problem in their workbooks and to explain their reasoning, step by step, in simple sentences.
''I did the exponents first and squared the 7,'' wrote Sharon Peterson, a junior. ''I multiplied 6 x 3. I added 3 + 49, and combined 18 and 11, because they were both negatives. I ended up with 52-29. The final answer was 23.''
Some students had more trouble, and the lesson seemed to drag a bit.
''This is taking longer than I expected, but it's not wasted time,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''They're learning math, but they're also learning to write.''
Brockton's performance is not as stellar in math as in English language arts, and the committee has hired an outside consultant to help develop strategies for improving math instruction, Mr. Perkins said.
Dr. Ferguson said Brockton High first ''jumped out of the data'' for him early last year. He was examining Massachusetts' 2008 test scores in his office in Cambridge, and noticed that Brockton had done a better job than 90 percent of the state's 350 high schools helping its students to improve their language arts scores.
Since then, he has visited Brockton intermittently and invited some of its faculty to the Harvard campus for interviews. The report he wrote with four other Harvard researchers includes an analysis of exemplary performance not only at Brockton, but also at 14 other schools in five states.
The report noted one characteristic shared by all: ''Achievement rose when leadership teams focused thoughtfully and relentlessly on improving the quality of instruction.''
Brockton was by far the largest, but only five of the exemplary schools had fewer than 1,000 students, while six had more than 1,700 and two in Illinois had more than 3,000.
''I never bought into the dogma that a huge school can't be great,'' Dr. Ferguson said.

HEADLINE: What Is Paladino About?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Is the Republican candidate for governor of New York a racist, sexist, pornography-loving creep? Or are there other, more benign, explanations for the stomach-turning e-mails distributed by Carl Paladino?
One of the things that can happen in the news business is that some portion of a story becomes so vile, so offensive, it is virtually impossible to effectively recount or describe. Reporters keep their distance. Editors lunge for the delete button.
Such is the case with the images and videos forwarded by Mr. Paladino to a wide variety of people. The public should know about these mailings, and Mr. Paladino should give a full, thoughtful explanation of why he trafficked in such filth. 
Example: A photo showing a group of black men trying to get out of the way of an airplane that is apparently moving across a field. The caption reads: ''Run niggers, run.''
Example: A doctored photo of President and Mrs. Obama showing the president in a stereotypical pimp's costume holding the hand of the first lady, who is dressed as a prostitute in a grotesquely revealing outfit.
Example: A video clip of a nude couple engaged in intercourse with the title: ''Miss France [expletive].'' Mr. Paladino characterized it as ''a keeper.''
Example: An image showing a woman performing a sexual act on a horse.
There are many more. Mr. Paladino has acknowledged forwarding the e-mails, which he said was evidence of ''poor judgment'' on his part. But that's not sufficient. The e-mails raise legitimate questions about the fitness of the sender to hold the highest office in the state, and Mr. Paladino should feel an obligation to put those questions to rest.
The images and videos are so blatantly hostile to blacks and women that it's fair to wonder whether Mr. Paladino is prejudiced against them. He's made it clear that he's fully capable of mindless stereotyping -- letting us know, for example, that people from Manhattan, who tend to be ''smug'' and ''elitist,'' are his least favorite New Yorkers.
Questions about possible prejudice are germane whenever a candidate aspires to public office. In Mr. Paladino's case, the questions are entwined with some of his specific policy positions. He believes that space in prisons should be turned into work camps in which poor people would get, among other types of training, classes in personal hygiene. The camps would be part of Mr. Paladino's proposed ''Dignity Corps,'' the inference being that the poor lack dignity in the first place, along with their presumed lack of cleanliness. (It's a good bet that Mr. Paladino is oblivious to the extreme irony of someone who sends out racist and pornographic e-mails counseling others about personal dignity.)
But while aiming to bolster the sagging dignity of poor New Yorkers, Mr. Paladino would simultaneously hack away at their health care. He has said that one of his first acts as governor would be to cut Medicaid -- which provides health services to the poor -- by $20 billion.
On an issue of particular concern to women, Mr. Paladino is opposed to abortion in virtually all instances, including cases of rape and incest. The only exception, according to a spokesman, would be if the life of the woman was at stake.
Michael Caputo, Mr. Paladino's campaign manager, said the candidate is sorry for sending the e-mails and has apologized a number of times. But when asked to explain why his boss engaged in this pattern of distributing such offensive material, he could only repeat, as Mr. Paladino has: ''Bad judgment.''
This does not give voters any insight into how Mr. Paladino really feels about blacks and other minorities; or about women, who just happen to make up half the population of the state that he would be governing; or about the most extreme forms of hard-core pornography.
As for the poor, Mr. Caputo said that Mr. Paladino has at times not fully explained his expansive plans for welfare recipients, failing public school students, and men and women who receive unemployment benefits. He said a Governor Paladino would ask parents of struggling students to send them to state-sponsored boarding schools, which would also house children taken from their parents ''because of social service or child welfare reasons.''
He said all recipients of long-term unemployment insurance or welfare services (except for the disabled and mothers with small children) would be required to work (or be re-trained) in government programs in order to get their benefits. This would include, he said, those who are already very well educated.
I don't think voters quite know what they might be getting with Mr. Paladino. New Yorkers need to hear much more from him.

HEADLINE: Philharmonic President Is to Depart, as Music World Changes

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The musicians rehearse, the conductor leads a concert, the audience applauds, and everybody goes home.
Or that is the way it used to be. The announcement on Monday that Zarin Mehta, 71, will step down as president of the venerable New York Philharmonic comes at a moment when orchestra executives are rethinking the role of the symphony in American society.
Mr. Mehta, 71, who also holds the title of executive director, said he would leave after the close of the 2011-12 season, bringing his tenure to 12 years at the helm of one of the world's leading musical institutions.
''I had to make a decision on where my life is taking me,'' he said in an interview, ''and I decided that would be the right time to step down from the New York Philharmonic and have somebody else come in.'' 
Mr. Mehta's replacement will join two recent arrivals at the Philharmonic and complete a generational shift. Alan Gilbert, 43, arrived last season as music director, along with Gary W. Parr, 53, a prominent investment banker, as board chairman.
The early notice gives Mr. Parr and the board plenty of time to find a successor, Mr. Mehta said, adding that when he goes, Mr. Gilbert will have completed three seasons and will have planned a fourth in his five-year contract.
''My successor will be in a position with the board to decide what Alan's future is and what I hope is his extension,'' Mr. Mehta said, ''although I'm not announcing anything.''
The new top executive will have to deal with two immediate concerns at the Philharmonic: the long-sought renovation of the orchestra's sonically drab home, Avery Fisher Hall, and the search for a significant summer residence -- a New York version of the Chicago Symphony's Ravinia Festival or the Boston Symphony's Tanglewood. Solutions have eluded Mr. Mehta on both counts.
Much has already changed at the Philharmonic, with the introduction of its live concerts on iTunes, a celebrity broadcast host (Alec Baldwin) and a vastly expanded Web site, nyphil.org, not to mention the increasingly evident programming stamp of Mr. Gilbert.
But in the future the new Philharmonic leadership is also likely to grapple with larger questions, much as orchestra executives are doing around the country, including fundamental matters like how to pay for their activities and how to engage audiences reared in a digital, electronic and social-networking world.
''It has to do with the music you play,'' said Deborah Borda, the president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. ''It has to do with how you integrate yourself with the fabric of the community.'' The rethinking affects marketing and a host of new-media initiatives, Ms. Borda said, ''It's a completely changing universe.''
At the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Parr said it was too early to outline any changes. ''I look forward to us thinking though what is it that really matters,'' he said, ''and do we need to do anything different than what we did 10 years ago.''
The recession has put enormous pressure on orchestras and the donations and endowment income that account for most of their revenues. Deficits are endemic, including an expected $4.5 million for last season at the Philharmonic, where the endowment has dropped from $212 million to $170 million during Mr. Mehta's decade there. The appropriate sum for an orchestra of the Philharmonic's size should be $250 million to $270 million, he said.
Fixed pension costs and major salary gains in recent decades have made orchestras expensive to run, although many musicians would argue that the money keeps quality high and that managers have a responsibility to raise the dollars.
Management has successfully won salary givebacks over the last several years at a number of orchestras. The two sides also periodically struggle over work rules during labor negotiations. The New York Philharmonic's contract expires next September, and one of Mr. Mehta's last major tasks will be to negotiate a new one.
Money and rules are at issue in a current labor dispute at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, where management is seeking to cut base salaries by one-third. (The musicians, offering a 22 percent cut, are promising to strike on Monday.) Management also argues that it must change the definition of an orchestra musician, partly to make the Detroit Symphony more relevant to the community -- a cherished goal professed by orchestra administrators -- and partly to save money.
Already orchestras have fashioned themselves as providers of the music education that has been draining out of school systems. Witness the Los Angeles Philharmonic's much-publicized sponsorship of a new youth symphony with the arrival of its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, now 29, a product of Venezuela's Sistema, a nationwide network of training ensembles for young people in poor areas.
The Detroit Symphony proposal would require the orchestra musicians to carry out a host of nontypical activities, if called upon. These include coaching youth orchestras, visiting schools, playing chamber music concerts, giving talks or even writing in their own bowing marks in the string parts, according to Haden McKay, a spokesman for the players and member of the cello section. The change, he said, would make the orchestra ''a glorified booking agency.''
The orchestra's president, Anne Parsons, said orchestra members performed such activities voluntarily already, and they would not be asked to do anything that would hurt the orchestra's quality. ''When you're trying to create a vision for the future, you go for it,'' she said. ''We're trying to figure out what is a sustainable business model.''
At the same time, orchestras have embraced a host of new activities that would probably have left Toscanini with his mouth agape in amazement.
Video projections have come to the concert hall, as in the Houston Symphony's program of Holst's ''Planets,'' illustrated by NASA photos. Orchestras are streaming performances live on the Internet or in movie theaters; allowing audiences to vote for encores through text messages; or establishing preconcert happy hours.
YouTube promotions are standard. The 168-year-old New York Philharmonic has put up humorous videos of Mr. Gilbert to promote performances of the postmodern opera ''Le Grand Macabre'' by Ligeti, itself a production cast as a major event on the New York cultural scene.
Mr. Gilbert has sought to break down the formality of the concert hall by occasionally talking to the audience, and has begun a blog on musicalamerica.com.
The nuts and bolts of selling concerts, too, is changing. In the old days people bought long subscriptions for concerts, giving orchestras a dependable source of advance income. Subscribers now account for only 60 percent of tickets instead of the once-prevalent 80 percent at the Philharmonic, Mr. Mehta said. Instead of subscribing to 14 or 16 concerts a year, they are buying 6 or 8.
Mr. Mehta's successor will have to deal with this new world, and specific problems, like the long-delayed plans to renovate Avery Fisher Hall. The question of how to proceed, or even whether to proceed, remains in the air, despite the board's approval of a redesign by the British architect Norman Foster in 2005.
Mr. Mehta's accomplishments include maintaining labor peace; a record of exotic touring, including a singular visit to North Korea; and helping bring Credit Suisse aboard as global sponsor. The orchestra does not reveal how much that financial services group gives, but Mr. Mehta put the amount in the seven figures. A three-year commitment from Credit Suisse has just been renewed for another three years, he said.
He also negotiated new agreements with the players on recordings and other uses of performances in the media, making them more cost-effective through sharing revenue with the players rather than providing high fixed payments up front.
Mr. Mehta noted that about two-thirds of the board of directors came in during his watch, and the giving level, he said, is among the highest of major orchestras in the country. ''We have people now who put their money where their mouth is,'' he added.
But his term will also be remembered for failed efforts to merge the orchestra with Carnegie Hall and for abortive attempts to visit Cuba and the Republic of Georgia.
Mr. Mehta, a member of a prominent Mumbai musical family and a younger brother of the conductor Zubin Mehta, dismissed such matters as out of his control.
As for the United States government's rejection of the Philharmonic's travel application for Cuba because the orchestra wanted to take along tour sponsors, Mr. Mehta said, ''It's absolutely wrong on the part of the government that they think we should go there and play, but we can't take the people who pay for it.''
''But that's the government's rule,'' he added.
Mr. Mehta made his announcement just days after the government of Georgia canceled its invitation to visit next month, when the orchestra will be on tour in Europe. He blamed Georgian officials for acting irresponsibly.
Mr. Parr said the matter ''certainly wasn't a factor'' in the timing of Mr. Mehta's announcement.

HEADLINE: UDON THANI JOURNAL; Drawing Western Men With Marriage in Mind

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
UDON, THAILAND -- The most dazzling creatures Nui Davis saw when she was a child were the village girls who had found foreign husbands, visiting in their Western finery and handing out candies to the children.
''For me, they were like a princess,'' she said. ''And I kept those pictures in my mind, and I made a wish that one day I would like to be one of those ladies.''
Today, at the age of 30, she lives with her husband, Joseph Davis of Fresno, California, in an air-conditioned, three-bedroom house with a driveway and basketball hoop, surrounded by flower beds and a well-kept lawn.
''My family keeps saying, 'You got it. You got your dream now,''' she said. 
But unlike many other foreign husbands, Mr. Davis, 54, did not take his wife home with him, choosing instead to settle down in northeastern Thailand, a region known as Isaan.
He is part of an expanding population of nearly 11,000 foreign husbands in the region, drawn by the low cost of living, slow pace of life and the exotic reputation of Thai women -- something like a brand name for Western men seeking Asian partners. ''Thai women are a lot like women in America were 50 years ago,'' said Mr. Davis, before they discovered their rights and became ''strong-headed and opinionated.''
''The women now know they are equal,'' said Mr. Davis, a retired Naval officer who has been divorced twice, ''so the situation is not as relaxed and peaceful as it is between an American and a Thai lady.''
It is easy to spot the foreigners' homes, with their sturdy walls and red-tiled roofs, an archipelago of affluence among the smaller, poorer houses of their new neighbors and in-laws.
Mixed couples are common on the streets and in the markets of Udon Thani. One street where Western men gather to eat and drink is popularly known as ''Foreign Son-in-Law Street.''
''There are villages in Isaan that are almost entirely comprising foreign houses, where the whole village is almost entirely houses purchased by foreigners for their Thai ladies,'' said Phil Nicks, author of ''Love Entrepreneurs: Cross-Culture Relationship Deals in Thailand.''
Isaan is one of the poorest parts of the country, the source of most low-wage workers in Bangkok and the home of many of the women who work in the entertainment industry in the capital.
Some of the earliest Thai-American marriages were in Udon Thani, the site of a U.S. air base in the 1960s during the Vietnam War. In the following years, most Americans left, sometimes taking a Thai wife with them. Now the presence of American and European men is growing again. ''In the northeast where this phenomenon is strongest, a huge majority of the women there are looking for a foreign boyfriend or husband, and I think some of them can be quite assertive, and aggressive in their pursuing of a foreign man,'' said Mr. Nicks.
A clash of expectations strains many marriages, and more than half end in divorce, said Prayoon Thavon, manager of international services at Panyavejinter Hospital in Udon Thani.
While the men -- many of them retired and living on pensions, many disappointed in their lives and marriages at home -- may be seeking an emotional connection, the women are generally motivated by economics, said Mr. Prayoon, who provides counseling for mixed couples.
''For some ladies it is just money, money, money,'' he said. ''Getting married has become a business more than love. People want to improve their social status. Sometimes these ladies spend the husband's money, use it all, then he's cut out. There are many cases like that.''
Even though many men are retired and living on a fixed income, they are expected to help support their wives' extended families, beginning with a dowry of several thousand dollars.
''When you get married in Thailand you are marrying the whole family, the whole village,'' Mr. Prayoon said. ''Often the lady expects that, but the man doesn't understand.''
There seems to be less concern about differences in age, with many bridegrooms in their 50s or 60s or even 70s.
''Age is not a factor here,'' said Mr. Davis. ''In America if I marry a girl who is 24 years younger than me, all you're going to get is eyes and bad talk, bad gossip. Here it's not an issue. It happens every day.''
At the age of 63, Dennis Sorensen, a retired mathematics teacher, is 32 years older than his wife, Pennapa, whom he met eight years ago on a beach. He spends much of his time watching U.S. television through a satellite hookup and cooks his own hamburgers, but he said he has done his best to keep his wife and her family happy. He helps raise her teenage daughter from an earlier relationship as well as their 2-year-old son.
''There's some adjustment there,'' said Mr. Sorensen, for whom this is the first marriage, ''and we've had issues where I run out of money and I cannot take care of everybody, and that has caused some crises, but we've overcome everything the best that we can.''
One barrier is language, as few foreigners learn Thai. ''I can't speak English so well, but I can live with him many years,'' Ms. Sorensen said, speaking in Thai. ''Sometimes when he is very upset I don't understand what he is talking about but I understand the tone and I just walk away.''
But she added in English: ''I think Dennis is good -- good for take care of my family, take care of my daughter, take care of everything for me. Before, I don't have anything. But right now I have a home, I have car, I not work and I only stay home and take care of my baby.''
Foreign marriage has become so common that it has lost much of its stigma here in Udon Thani, and many girls share Ms. Davis's dream of becoming a princess. ''It looks pretty good and they look pretty happy,'' said Rojjana Udomsri, 30, who is married to a Thai man and has a 2-year-old son. ''They have money to spend and they can go anywhere they want.''
But she said she had her doubts.
''I don't know if they are really happy,'' she said. ''There were times I wanted to have a good life like them, but I can't live with a person I don't love. With someone I love I can go through all the hardships of life together.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cleanup Is Set for Creek Long Polluted By Industry

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency has designated Newtown Creek, between Brooklyn and Queens, a Superfund site, promising a thorough environmental cleanup of a long-neglected waterway that was once one of the busiest hubs of industrial activity in the city.
The Superfund designation, which was announced on Monday by the agency's regional administrator in New York, Judith Enck, means that the E.P.A. will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the severely polluted creek to determine what kind of cleanup is needed and to identify continuing sources of pollution. Community advocates, environmental groups and members of Congress had long sought the designation out of concern about the extent of contamination and its possible danger to residents. 
The creek, about four miles long, is now the second active Superfund site in the city. The Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, another waterway suffering the consequences of its industrial past, was placed in March on the Superfund's National Priorities List, a designation reserved for the worst-contaminated sites in the nation.
Six other Superfund sites across the country were also chosen on Monday, including a section of the Black River in Jefferson County, N.Y., that was contaminated with P.C.B.'s and other chemicals. P.C.B.'s, or polychlorinated biphenyls, can cause cancer and affect the immune, reproductive, nervous and endocrine systems, according to the E.P.A.
''Newtown Creek is a key urban waterway, which provides recreational and economic resources to many communities,'' Ms. Enck said in a written statement. ''Throughout the investigation and cleanup, we will work closely with the communities along the creek to achieve a revitalization of this heavily contaminated urban waterway.''
Water samples from Newtown Creek, a branch of the East River and part of the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary, have revealed the presence of pesticides, heavy metals, P.C.B.'s, volatile organic compounds and other contaminants. Despite the continuing pollution problems, the agency noted, residents use the creek for recreation like kayaking and fishing, and some eat the fish they catch.
The creek's polluted condition also reflects countless oil spills from the dozens of refineries and fuel storage centers that have operated along its banks since the 19th century.
Those spills -- estimated to total 17 million to 30 million gallons, as much as three times the amount dumped off the Alaska coast by the Exxon Valdez in 1989 -- have polluted an aquifer and hindered economic development as they made their way into both the creek and surrounding neighborhoods.
The Superfund cleanup will address only the water and sediment in the creek, not the contamination beneath the adjacent land in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. Oil companies, including Exxon Mobil and BP, which still has an active petroleum storage terminal by the creek, are recovering spilled oil from beneath their Greenpoint properties in a state-supervised cleanup that began after the Coast Guard first spotted evidence of oil seepage into the creek in 1978.
The oil companies are among the first six responsible entities identified by the E.P.A. under the Superfund program to help pay for the creek's cleanup. The city, which began dumping raw sewage into the creek in 1856, is one of the six responsible parties -- to date, the city has not fully stopped sewage overflow from going into the creek on rainy days -- and is also expected to be financially liable. Agency officials said there was no estimate of how much the city could have to pay.
The E.P.A.'s environmental investigation and cleanup could take 10 to 15 years, and agency officials said they expected the cost to exceed the $300 million to $500 million that work on the Gowanus Canal is expected to cost. The inquiry will begin with a feasibility study, and the cleanup will most likely involve some dredging, Ms. Enck said.
In a conference call with reporters on Monday, Ms. Enck said the agency was focusing on urban waterways because ''if they're clean, they can provide tremendous recreation and economic opportunities for millions of people.''
Some advocates say the designation should bring cohesion to the cleanup efforts in the area. Residents, environmental groups and the New York State attorney general's office have lawsuits pending against some or all of the oil companies over the pace and effectiveness of their remediation work.
''This is the only way that Newtown Creek is going to get cleaned up, with federal oversight and resources, so we're very excited,'' said Katie Schmid, director of the Newtown Creek Alliance, an advocacy group.
Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, who represents the area and had pushed for the designation for years, said that in the community meetings she held, residents were more concerned about toxic vapors and other air pollution rising from the creek and land than with any stigma of the Superfund label on development or property values.
''There's a consensus of support'' for a comprehensive cleanup, Ms. Velazquez said. ''I am very happy.''
The Bloomberg administration supported the Superfund listing for Newtown Creek, in contrast with its opposition to the designation for the Gowanus Canal. In the case of the Gowanus, the city had come up with an alternative plan that officials said would have led to a quicker cleanup and avoided scaring developers away from an area already scheduled for significant commercial and residential development.
The E.P.A., however, decided that the Superfund designation would guarantee the best results and ensure that polluters covered all the costs.
''What's going to get the job done fastest and more efficiently?'' said Caswell F. Holloway, the commissioner for the city's Department of Environmental Protection. ''In the case of Newtown Creek, we believe the Superfund process is the way to do that.''
Ms. Schmid noted that the designation did raise concerns about how the Superfund study and cleanup might affect existing projects, like construction of affordable housing and plans for new public spaces. Residents and business owners also have said they were worried about increased truck traffic and restrictions on use of the creek, which some businesses rely on to ferry scrap metal and other goods.
Ms. Schmid said these were among the issues neighbors and local groups would be addressing with the agency as the Superfund project got started.

HEADLINE: Shares Move Lower Amid a Rush of Deals

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Jad Mouawad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street finished lower on Monday, stopping the September rally for at least one day.
Despite a rush of mergers, there was little in the way of fresh economic news to propel shares. Analysts said that as the quarter neared a close, some traders were looking to lock in gains that had given the broader market its best monthly performance since 1939. ''The single biggest driver to us seemed to be a bit of a pause in the run we had,'' Brian Lazorishak, portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel, said. ''Consolidation, and maybe some people taking profits before the end of the quarter and people unwilling to pay up. It just feels like the market got a little bit ahead of itself.''
James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said: ''I think we don't have a lot of economic news here, and we are dealing with a boatload of technicals. We had a huge 8 to 10 percent move in the last 20 trading days. There have been very few pullbacks.'' 
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 48.22 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,812.04, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 6.51 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,142.16. The Nasdaq composite index lost 11.45 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2,369.77.
Mr. Lazorishak said the merger and acquisition activity was the ''biggest positive'' in the market, ''but there was not much follow-through.''
Southwest Airlines said it had agreed to buy its smaller rival AirTran Airways in a transaction valued at $1.4 billion, expanding its foothold in New York and Boston and allowing it to move into Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. Southwest said the purchase had been approved by the boards of both companies, although it still needed regulatory and shareholder approval.
In addition, Wal-Mart Stores said that it had made a proposal to acquire Massmart Holdings, which is based in South Africa. And Unilever announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Alberto Culver for $3.7 billion.
Shares of Southwest increased $1.07 to close at $13.35, while AirTran rose $2.79, to $7.34. Wal-Mart was down 60 cents at $53.48 and Alberto Culver gained $6.16, to $37.64.
Financial stocks declined more than 1 percent, led by M&T Bank, which lost $6.38, or 7 percent, to close at $84.24.
Analysts cited reports that M&T Bank's talks with Banco Santander to buy Sovereign Bank had stalled. In addition, Moody's cut its ratings of Anglo Irish Bank.
M&T Bank ''could be weighing on the banking sector,'' William T. Fitzpatrick, equities analyst for Optique Capital Management, said. ''But there is not a lot of economic data today.''
Some analysts suggested that the market was likely to see some volatility over the next weeks but that there would not be much net change by the end of the year.
The S.& P. rose 9.47 percent in the month to last Friday.
''After a huge rally in the month of September, it would not be a major surprise for some type of consolidation, but we think there is a lot of short-covering potential left,'' Todd Salamone, Schaeffer's Investment Research's senior vice president for research, said. ''Whether it's mergers and acquisitions, or buyback activity taking some supply out of the market, or a continued low interest rate environment, one could argue they could impact the intermediate market.''
Scott Wren, a senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said he expected more merger and acquisition activity, which typically provided a temporary lift for the markets.
But, Mr. Wren said, traders remained focused on the economy.
That emphasis was evident last week, when the markets closed higher, after a report on manufactured goods orders that some investors viewed as a sign of a stabilizing economy. Reports this week on consumer confidence, housing and economic output will probably not have as much impact because expectations are already built into the market.
''This is one of those weeks where you have a reasonable amount of data but you don't really have a lot that I don't think can really drive the market,'' Mr. Wren said. ''And in the final weeks prior to the election, other than employment surprise news, a lot of this stuff is just not going to move the market around.''
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 23/32 to 100 5/32, and the yield fell to 2.52 percent from 2.60 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Tom Joad Gave Up

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Atherton, Calif.
Sometimes it's hard to remember what good government looks like: government that disciplines itself but looks to the long term; government that inspires trust; government that promotes social mobility without busting the budget.
That kind of government existed for decades right here in California. Between 1911 and the '60s, California had a series of governors -- like Hiram Johnson, Earl Warren, Goodwin Knight and Pat Brown -- who were pro-market and pro-business, but also progressive reformers.
They rode a great wave of prosperity, and people flocked to the Golden State, but they used the fruits of that prosperity in a disciplined way to lay the groundwork for even more growth. They built an outstanding school and university system. They started a series of gigantic public works projects that today are seen as engineering miracles. These included monumental water projects, harbors and ports, the sprawling highway system and even mental health facilities. 
They disdained partisanship. They continually reorganized government to make it more businesslike and cost effective. ''Thus,'' the historian Kevin Starr has written, ''California progressivism contained within itself both liberal and conservative impulses, as judged by the standards of today.''
Most important, California progressives focused on the middle class. By the end of these years, California enjoyed the highest living standards in the country. The core of the state's strength was in the suburbs. Between 1945 and 1950 alone, the San Fernando Valley doubled in population. In one 12-month period, between 1959 and 1960, Valley residents applied for 6,000 swimming pool permits.
In fits and starts, California's progressive model has been abandoned. The state's current economic decline and political stagnation is a result of that abandonment. Now California government has all the dysfunctions that mark national government, but at a more advanced stage.
Both parties helped kill off California's pro-market progressivism. Some assaults came from the left. First, there was the growing power of the public sector employee unions. These unions began lobbying for richer salaries and pensions. That, of course, is their job. But in the 1970s, governors started caving in. Money that could have gone into development went into prison guard benefits. Infrastructure spending, for example, has dropped from 20 percent of the state budget to 3 percent.
Then there was the growing power of the environmental movement. In the 1960s, environmental groups protested against the excesses of the infrastructure boom. Many of their complaints were absolutely legitimate. But over the years, environmental concern transmogrified into a ''small is beautiful'' ideology. A new cadre of activists arose -- hostile to suburbia, skeptical of capitalism and eager to impose greater regulations and costs on small businesses.
As Joel Kotkin of Chapman University has pointed out, the interests of the affluent class along the coasts began to crowd out the interests of the middle-class suburbanites and agricultural workers further inland. ''The result,'' he writes, ''is two separate California realities: a lucrative one for the wealthy and for government workers, who are largely insulated from economic decline; and a grim one for the private-sector middle and working classes, who are fleeing the state.''
Another assault on California progressivism came from the right. Conservatives refused to acknowledge the public sector's role in creating the state's prosperity. With Proposition 13 and other measures that cut taxes, they cut off revenue and pushed through structural reforms, making it hard for future administrations to raise funds. Many on the right became unwilling to think creatively about using government to promote prosperity.
The result is a state in crisis. Eighty-two percent of Californians say they believe their state is heading in the wrong direction, according to this week's University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times survey. State growth has lagged behind national growth. Unemployment is at 12.4 percent statewide and at catastrophic levels in the Central Valley. More people are leaving California for Oklahoma and Texas than came here during the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s. Tom Joad is giving up.
Meanwhile, the political set is an embarrassment. As jobs disappear, legislators are fixated on transgender rights and deals for lobbyists. Legislators are polarized and gridlocked. The pension system is $300 billion in the red, and the state hops from one fiscal crisis to the next.
The answer is to return to the tradition of pro-market progressivism that built modern California in the first place. Except this time, it can't be about building up the '50s-style suburbs. It needs to focus on supporting the immigrant entrepreneurs, averting state bankruptcy and unleashing the industrial and agricultural base.
The antigovernment conservatives and the unions have built institutions and bases of support. The heirs to the pro-market progressive tradition have not. What's needed is not a revolution, but a restoration and a modernization of what California once had.

HEADLINE: MacArthur Foundation Honors 23 'Geniuses'

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
The creator of the television series ''The Wire,'' about drugs, poverty and corruption in Baltimore; a historian who traced the lives of a slave family connected to Thomas Jefferson; and an economist who helped calculate the worth of a standout kindergarten teacher were among the 23 recipients of the $500,000 ''genius awards'' to be announced on Tuesday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
As in years past, the list of winners was a mix of those distinguished among their peers and those who have found a bigger stage. They include David Simon, 50, a writer and producer for critically acclaimed television shows, including ''The Wire,'' broadcast on HBO from 2002 to 2008, and ''Treme,'' about a struggling post-Katrina neighborhood in New Orleans, which is currently on that same network. 
''Obviously, I'm very grateful but I have a vague sense of not belonging,'' Mr. Simon said in a telephone interview about his grant. He said past winners had done ''tangible things to improve conditions.''
Still, storytellers can also make a difference, said Mr. Simon, who now splits his time between Baltimore and New Orleans. He expects the MacArthur imprimatur to help move the discussion of the ideas in his work from the ''entertainment pages to the op-ed pages,'' he said. ''One overt argument that 'The Wire' was making is that the drug war is amoral and untenable,'' Mr. Simon added.
Twelve men and 11 women, ranging in age from 30 to 72, were named MacArthur fellows this year. All will receive $100,000 a year for five years, no strings attached.
The youngest, John Dabiri, 30, is a biophysicist at the California Institute of Technology who explores the hydrodynamics of jellyfish propulsion. The oldest, Matthew Carter, 72, is a type designer in Cambridge, Mass., known for his elegant letter forms for different mediums. Mr. Carter also designed the typefaces used for headlines in The New York Times newspaper.
Since the inception of the program in 1981 and including this year's fellows, 828 people, ranging in age from 18 to 82 at the time of their selection, have been named.
Besides Mr. Simon, prominent storytellers this year include Annette Gordon-Reed, 51, whose book ''The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family'' (W. W. Norton) won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in History and the 2008 National Book Award for nonfiction. Ms. Gordon-Reed investigated the story of the slave family that included Sally Hemings, a slave owned by Jefferson who scholars widely believe bore his children. A New Yorker, Ms. Gordon-Reed teaches law and history at Harvard. Some of her grant will go toward travel expenses as she researches another book on the Hemings, she said.
Another winner, David Cromer, 45, is a theater director and actor recognized for his work Off Broadway and for revivals of classics, including a long-running revival of ''Our Town,'' at the Barrow Street Theater in New York. Mr. Cromer, also a New Yorker, said the grant would allow him to take artistic risks.
''It robs me of my greatest excuse for everything -- I'm broke,'' Mr. Cromer said of his award.
Other winners in the arts were Nicholas Benson, 46, a stone carver who is expanding the tradition; Yiyun Li, 37, a fiction writer exploring a changing China; Jason Moran, 35, a genre-bending jazz pianist and composer; Jorge Pardo, 47, an installation artist breaking down boundaries between fine art and design; Sebastian Ruth, 35, a violist, violinist and music educator for urban children; and Elizabeth Turk, 48, a sculptor making intricate marble art.
Thirteen of the winners this year work in the sciences, and 10 are in the arts.
''The thing that strikes me is the diversity, in addition to the brilliance and promise,'' Robert Gallucci, president of the MacArthur Foundation, said of the new fellows.
Carol Padden, 55, who studies sign languages and how they have evolved, is the first deaf person to receive a MacArthur grant. A professor in the department of communications at the University of California, San Diego, she and her colleagues made headlines for their studies of Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, used in a small village in the Negev desert of Israel. It represented a rare opportunity to study and identify the innate elements of a language.
''It's amazing,'' Dr. Padden said of the grant in a telephone interview using an interpreter. ''It's a terrific honor.'' She will probably use the money to continue her work, she said.
Nergis Mavalvala, 42, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said she hoped the high number of grants to scientists would be inspiring to those with a scientific bent. Her work involves making instruments sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves that emanate from black holes and from the earliest moments of the beginning of the universe.
While many fellows are affiliated with large research institutions, Amir Abo-Shaeer, 38, teaches physics at a public high school. He is director of the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy in Goleta, Calif., a program that incorporates a robotics competition into the curriculum.
''I want to change the whole culture of what an engineer looks like and what an engineer does,'' Mr. Abo-Shaeer said in an interview, adding that he was especially proud that half of his students are female.
Other winners in the sciences were Jessie Little Doe Baird, 46, who preserves the Wopanaak language of the Wampanoag Indian tribe of Massachusetts; Kelly Benoit-Bird, 34, of Oregon State University, a marine biologist using acoustic engineering technology to research ocean creatures; Drew Berry, 40, of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia, who uses biomedical animation to understand biological processes and systems; and Carlos D. Bustamante, 35, a Stanford University School of Medicine population geneticist who uses DNA data to study evolution.
Also honored are Shannon Lee Dawdy, 43, a University of Chicago anthropologist who uses archaeology and historical preservation techniques to study New Orleans; Michal Lipson, 40, an optical physicist at Cornell University who designs photonic circuits; Emmanuel Saez, 37, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who studied, among other things, the economic impact of outstanding kindergarten teachers; Dawn Song, 35, a computer security specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, who increases the stability of vulnerable computer systems; and Marla Spivak, 55, an entomologist at the University of Minnesota who studies and protects the honey bee.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Bids for Massmart to Expand Into Africa

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores announced plans on Monday to enter the African market, with a preliminary offer to buy the Johannesburg-based retailer Massmart Holdings for about $4.2 billion.
While Wal-Mart operates in 14 countries in addition to the United States, it has no stores in Africa.
The retail giant has emphasized international sales, which make up about a quarter of its revenue, as sales in the United States have softened. Sales at stores open at least a year have declined for five consecutive quarters in the United States. Wal-Mart has used a variety of approaches in other countries, like opening Sam's Clubs and Supercenters in China and Brazil, and buying stakes in existing retailers in Chile and El Salvador. 
The chief executive of Massmart, Grant Pattison, said that the company was first approached by Wal-Mart on Friday, and Massmart's board met on Sunday to discuss the proposal.
The offer is preliminary and nonbinding, meaning that Wal-Mart is beginning to conduct due diligence, could back out at any time and has not made a formal offer requiring shareholder approval.
Massmart can be described as a combination of Wal-Mart and Home Depot, selling general merchandise and home improvement supplies in 14 sub-Saharan countries, though most of its operations are in South Africa. It is also the biggest retailer of basic foods in the region. Sales for its most recent fiscal year, ended in June, were about $6.8 billion, up 10 percent from the previous year.
The company has 232 stores in South Africa, and 24 additional stores in other sub-Saharan African countries, including Builders Warehouse, which focuses on home improvement; Makro, a warehouse store; and CellShack, which sells cellular phones.
''South Africa presents a compelling growth opportunity for Wal-Mart and offers a platform for growth and expansion in other African countries,'' Andy Bond, a Wal-Mart executive who oversees the region's operations, said in a statement.
Analysts, however, were skeptical and questioned whether the purchase would be the best use of Wal-Mart's $10.2 billion in cash.
David Strasser, an analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott, noted that the proposed purchase price was high, at 13 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. ''Returns will lag for years to come,'' he said in a note to clients. He noted that Massmart was relatively far along in South Africa, which he said he believed had the best economy on the continent, so would need to grow in the other countries where it did business.
''For this deal to drive returns, we believe it is essential to succeed by using this acquisition as a springboard,'' Mr. Strasser said. ''For every relatively stable country like Botswana, there is a Zimbabwe.''
Colin McGranahan, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, noted that the proposed price -- $20.94 a share -- was about a 10 percent premium over Massmart's closing price before the offer was announced.
''Investors may have reservations about the company's decision to pursue acquisitions in a new part of the world, particularly at such high multiples and when Wal-Mart's own stock is trading at a much lower valuation,'' he said in a note to clients. ''Although the acquisition is modest compared to the size of the overall company, it may disappoint people hoping that the company would begin to return more capital to shareholders.''
In a video posted on Massmart's Web site, its chief executive, Mr. Pattison, said: ''We are at the beginning of a process. The next step is to complete the due diligence and thereafter we will seek regulatory and shareholder approval.''
''There are several conditions, the most important being the completion of a confirmatory due diligence by Wal-Mart,'' Mr. Pattison said, adding that both companies had agreed to a period of exclusivity to discuss the proposal.
Wal-Mart and Massmart representatives declined comment beyond what was posted on their company Web sites.

HEADLINE: Profiles in Timidity

 BODY:
We are starting to wonder whether Congressional Democrats lack the courage of their convictions, or simply lack convictions.
Last week, Senate Democrats did not even bother to schedule a debate, let alone a vote, on the expiring Bush tax cuts. This week, House Democrats appear poised to follow suit. The idea is to spare incumbents from having to vote before Nov. 2 on whether to let the rich go on paying less taxes than the nation needs them to pay.
This particular failure to act was not about Republican obstructionism, of which there has been plenty. This was about Democrats failing to seize an opportunity to do the right thing and at the same time draw a sharp distinction between themselves and the Republicans. 
President Obama has been steadfast -- and basically correct -- in calling to extend the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpayers and to let them expire for the top 2 percent. But by postponing a vote on the cuts, Democrats are increasing the likelihood of an eventual cave-in to Republicans, who are pushing for an extension of all the tax cuts, including the high-end ones.
We presume that Democrats, especially those in more conservative districts, are doing this in response to the anti-Washington insurgency on the right. But it's hard to imagine that conservative voters will confuse them for Republicans, and punting on the tax cuts won't score them any points with the Democratic base.
As the politics of the tax-cut fight move to center stage, far more important issues are being pushed into the background. Letting the high-end tax cuts expire, for instance, is a crucial step in the long process of reducing the federal budget deficit. Extending them will add $700 billion more to the debt over the next decade than under the Obama administration's tax proposal -- and for what? To bolster the weak economy, the money would be better spent in any of several more demonstrably effective ways, like payroll tax cuts, infrastructure spending or state aid to hire more teachers and police.
Letting the high-end cuts expire would also be a strong signal to the nation's creditors that Congress has the political will to cut deficits and, by extension, to prudently service debts. Delaying a vote on the tax cuts leaves that message hopelessly muddled.
To their credit, 46 House Democrats sent a letter recently urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold a vote on the tax cuts before the election. But 31 other Democrats -- many of them self-described deficit hawks -- also sent a letter urging that the high-end tax cuts be extended.
The American public is right to be confused and distrustful of its elected representatives.
Their focus on the well-being of the richest Americans is eclipsing the needs and concerns of vulnerable Americans. A roughly $1 billion pro-work program in last year's stimulus law that has provided jobs to 250,000 low-income workers is scheduled to expire at the end of September. But with less than a week to go before adjourning, Democrats have been unable to get Republican support to extend the program or, it seems, to make the Republicans pay a political price for being the Party of No.
This program is a model of the welfare-to-work initiatives long championed by the Republican Party. But Republican lawmakers would prefer to end it than to let the Obama stimulus package be seen as helpful. So deep is their desire to thwart Mr. Obama and the Democrats, that they are ignoring Republican governors who have called for the program's continuation. And they have indicated they would vote down a must-pass spending bill and other last-minute legislation if Democrats attach a provision to extend the program to those bills.
That is pure obstructionism, but it leaves Democrats still struggling to challenge the Republicans' ability to define the terms of the political debate this election season, while Americans who really need the help go without.

HEADLINE: Southwest, Determined to Expand, Buys AirTran

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The merger fever in the airline business is showing no signs of abating.
Southwest Airlines, the nation's biggest low-cost carrier, said in a surprise announcement on Monday that it had agreed to buy its smaller rival AirTran Airways for $1.4 billion. The planned merger would be the third in the last two years in the battered airline industry, after Delta Air Lines bought Northwest in 2008, and the tie-up between United Airlines and Continental, due to be completed on Friday.
The Southwest deal comes as the demand for air travel remains sluggish. Even with the airlines holding down capacity, industry executives say, there are still too many planes chasing too few passengers. Airline analysts and some executives said the market would eventually center on just three or four major airlines. 
Southwest has traditionally managed to offer low fares by flying out of smaller airports where it is cheaper to operate and relying on a single type of Boeing 737 plane to reduce its operation costs. But while Southwest was promoting the deal as an expansion of the low-fare model, it was unclear how much effect on prices it would have as the carrier moved into major hubs like Atlanta and Washington and bolstered its minimal presence at La Guardia in New York.
Still, by expanding Southwest's network, especially in the Northeast, the deal would put pressure on the major airlines that have well-entrenched and dominant hubs there.
The deal poses a particular challenge to the carriers that have not bulked up recently, especially American Airlines and US Airways.
American, in particular, could now face more pressure to find a partner. Analysts have long suggested a tie-up with US Airways, but some also raise the possibility of bidding for Alaska Airlines or JetBlue Airways. Either would bolster American's presence on the West or East Coast.
''American and US Air must be in panic mode as Southwest continues to grow,'' said George Hobica, who runs airfarewatchdog.com, a consumer Web site. ''What next? An American-US Air marriage? Frontier-Midwest combine with USAir? JetBlue and American? The Southwest-AirTran merger came out of the blue, so anything and everything could be on the table.''
The deal would expand Southwest's network by 25 percent and give it its first international destinations in the Caribbean and Mexico. The combined networks of Southwest and AirTran have little overlap: each serves about 70 airports, but they compete directly on just 19 routes.
''Southwest is following the trend in the industry: merge or acquire in order to stay alive and competitive,'' said Brett R. Gordon, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School. ''From an economic perspective, this makes sense due to the economies of scale inherent in operating a large airline fleet.''
Southwest said the purchase had been approved by the boards of both companies, although it still needed regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal is valued at $3.4 billion when AirTran's debt and aircraft leases are included. Southwest has 547 planes while AirTran has 138.
The acquisition is only the third for Southwest in three decades and its most ambitious to date, said the company's chairman and chief executive, Gary C. Kelly. ''It is a huge piece of our strategy to grow Southwest over the next decade.''
The deal comes at a strategic juncture for Southwest, which had been looking for new ways to grow in recent years. The company had already been considering starting international flights to neighboring countries like Mexico. It has also been thinking about buying a longer version of its workhorse Boeing 737 that can accommodate more seats and carry more passengers on its existing routes.
Still, Mr. Kelly admitted that without the purchase, the company's growth prospects would have been ''modest.''
Investors welcomed the deal. Southwest shares rose 9 percent, at $13.35. Shares of AirTran Holdings, the airline's parent company, leaped 61 percent to $7.34 a share, to nearly match Southwest's offer.
Southwest has been one of the nation's few consistently profitable airlines, building success on a simple business model, which has remained relatively unchanged since the Texas company was founded in 1971 to serve Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. That low-cost formula allowed Southwest to quickly gain market share and overtake its higher-cost rivals. Even as the rest of the industry struggled amid steep losses that pushed several airlines into bankruptcy, Southwest overtook other airlines to become the top domestic carrier in the last decade. But with the prospect of a sluggish demand for air travel, the strategy showed its limits.
With opportunities to grow drying up, Southwest had clamored to get access to markets that it had once shunned, especially as it sought out business travelers who were asking for flights to the main airports in New York and Washington.
Southwest said the acquisition would open the door to Atlanta, the biggest hole in its network. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the nation's busiest airport, is Delta's hub; AirTran is the second-largest operator there.
Southwest has been stymied in its efforts to break into the New York market until recently. It has a few landing and take-off rights, called slots, at La Guardia Airport. Only in August, as part of the federal approval of the United-Continental merger, had Southwest obtained some slots at Newark Liberty International Airport. Southwest also flies to Long Island MacArthur Airport, and AirTran serves Westchester County Airport.
Still, the acquisition poses risks to Southwest's ''keep it simple'' strategy, analysts said.
AirTran's fleet, for instance, includes 86 Boeing 717s as well as 52 Boeing 737s. AirTran sells tickets through electronic reservation systems over the Internet, like Expedia, whereas Southwest relies solely on its own Web site to keep costs down. And AirTran has some agreements to sell tickets on other airlines, while Southwest generally does not.
But Southwest has recognized the need to adapt.
''What worked in 1971 or in 2001 is not what they need to grow in 2011,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, the airline analyst at Forrester Research. ''Taking on a certain degree of complexity can lead to a stronger business.''
For the moment, however, Mr. Kelly said the company had no plans to change its most distinctive customer policies, including free checked bags. The company also plans to continue operating a single class of service with open seating.

HEADLINE: A Love Affair Ends Badly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
CLEVELAND -- There is hair to be cut and money to be made, so Tony Houston opens his barbershop before the sun rises on weekends. To enter, you walk over a life-size decal of LeBron James, although just a few months ago the same image hung proudly on the barbershop's wall.
''So you can wipe your feet off,'' Houston explained when asked why James's sticker was now on the floor. ''You can wipe them off on the way out, too.''
If Houston had waited, he could have purchased his new floor decoration for a discount. Dan Gilbert, the Cleveland Cavaliers' owner, also owns Fathead, the company that produces decals like the one in Houston's barbershop. It was Gilbert who also reduced the price of James's decals to $17.41 this summer, matching the price with the year that Benedict Arnold was born. 
So it goes in Cleveland, where James used to play. It took only 14 words by James last July 8 -- ''I'm going to take my talents to South Beach and join the Miami Heat''-- to shatter opinions of him in much of Ohio. He was the kid from Akron who was destined to lead nearby Cleveland to some desperately sought championships.
Instead, he left without winning even one, igniting an emotional debate that continues as a new N.B.A. season approaches and the Cavaliers, and Cleveland, attempt to move on. Not that it is particularly easy to do so, particularly in a region that is both proud and sensitive, a combination that does not always mix.
''This community has been battered around a lot in the last 30 years, a lot of it unfairly starting with the Johnny Carson jokes on down,'' said David Gilbert, the president and chief executive of the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission. Gilbert is not related to Dan Gilbert.
''When things go good, people are very willing to jump in and be part of what's going on here and it's great,'' he added. ''But when things go bad, I think people take it even more personally than they might in other communities.''
More defiant was Joe Roman of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, who said it was untrue that James's departure would have any lasting economic impact on the city and the surrounding areas.
''Excuse me, but he's a basketball player,'' Roman said. ''Our economy is growing and it's investing more in the last three or four years than it probably has in the last 20.''
Optimism also came from Len Komoroski, the president of both the Cavaliers and Quicken Loans Arena, who spoke in an interview of record season-ticket sales for the approaching season. Still, there was a catch: the Cavaliers annually ask season-ticket holders to commit to the following season by March in order to guarantee the playoff seats they want. So when those commitments were made six months ago, it was still possible that James would stay put.
He didn't. And so on Monday, for the first time in seven years, James was not present as the Cavaliers held their annual media day to kick off training camp.
''Whether we believe it or not, he's not coming back,'' point guard Mo Williams said. He and the rest of James's ex-teammates will play under a new coach, Byron Scott, who has had success elsewhere. But a roster that was pieced together to complement James now looks like a complete hodgepodge without him.
''I hope so,'' Scott answered when asked if his players should take issue with people who discount them.
At the barbershop last weekend, customers and barbers dissected this new, and very modest, Cavaliers team. Some wondered if it was right to attend the first game James plays in Cleveland, in December. They debated how many points James would score in his return. They agreed it would be a high number.
ESPN's ''SportsCenter'' played in a loop in the background. A Phil Jackson interview came on the air, and the customers listened as Jackson said the emergence of the Heat as a major team would help the league. The footage flashed to the Heat's initial welcome ceremony for James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, the three of them preening and posturing in blinding white jerseys. ESPN was sending a crew to Miami to cover the Heat's media day.
''What time did they say that was?'' said a barber, Ron LaRue.
He said he might watch. They all might. Although James's decision to leave struck a nerve, Houston still keeps a printed list of Miami's roster at hand and argues with people who do not agree that the Heat has enough complementary talent to win a championship. The intrigue remains, but not the old adulation.
In fact, for some the issue is not really that James left. After all, others have also done so, including the original Cleveland Browns.
Instead, there is lingering resentment over the way James declared he was leaving -- in a nationally televised announcement. ''It's respect,'' Rob Wilson said as he waited for his haircut. ''It's all about respect, and he didn't show any.'' The frequent analogy is that the broadcast amounted to someone publicly breaking up with his girlfriend.
Keith Dambrot, the coach at the University of Akron and James's coach during his first two seasons at Akron's St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, doubted that the emotions would have lessened if James's decision had been made quietly -- if such an option had even been possible.
''I still think they would have fried him either way,'' Dambrot said.
Over the summer, James scrimmaged with some of Dambrot's players at the university. Akron, about a half-hour's drive south of Cleveland, is where James grew up, where he learned the game, where he still maintains his bikeathon as a charity event. Dambrot said that when James would grab something to eat in the university cafeteria after one of those summer scrimmages, people still showered him with attention.
''I'm sure it's probably a little hard for LeBron because he's never faced any fan adversity before,'' Dambrot said. ''I don't think much has changed in Akron, but in the rest of Ohio, there seems to be a lot of negative reaction.''
Indeed, James spoke of a distinction between Akron and Cleveland in a recent magazine article. Others in both Cleveland and Akron agreed that there is a difference in the two cites in the way James is now perceived. That point was driven home in a newspaper advertisement James took out after he picked the Heat: he thanked Akron but not Cleveland.
''Akron is standing up to those criticizing a young man who has done nothing wrong,'' said Robert Deck, an assistant coach when James played youth football in the city. ''That's his job and it's part of his business, going from one place to the next place.''
On the same day recently that Houston stepped on James's decal, Deck headed to a football field in Akron. He still coaches young players. Each of them, he said, still admires James.
Of James's much-criticized television announcement, Deck said: ''He did it like Frank Sinatra. He did it his way and you can't knock him for that.''
''The main people that were complaining were the rich and not the poor,'' Deck added. ''It was like Robin Hood, like LeBron stole from the rich and gave to the poor. You've got all these big-shot people and then you've got this little poor kid that comes from the neighborhood and you're putting all these expectations on him and then when he doesn't do what you ask of him, you're mad at him.''
As he watched James's televised goodbye to Cleveland, Deck said that he could see a conflicted James. ''I saw the hurt in his eyes,'' he said.
''You know what?'' said the sports commission's David Gilbert, echoing Deck. ''The next day the sun came up and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was still standing. I think a lot of people realized that.''

HEADLINE: The Value Of a Piece Of Facebook

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Yep, it was another deal hatched in Sun Valley.
During Allen & Company's annual mogul-fest in the Idaho mountains in July, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, devised a plan with Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark to donate a $100 million challenge grant for the city's troubled schools.
The gift, announced with much fanfare Friday on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' (with all the requisite swooning over the 26-year-old Mr. Zuckerberg's desire to give anonymously), attracted $40 million in matching gifts so far by Monday from the likes of William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager, and John Doerr, the venture capitalist. 
But Mr. Zuckerberg's donation has some scratching their heads.
How is he going to pay for it? After all, Facebook has yet to go public. In Silicon Valley's parlance, Mr. Zuckerberg is ''paper-rich, cash-poor.''
While Mr. Ackman and Mr. Doerr are probably making their charitable gifts in cold hard cash, Mr. Zuckerberg is doing something different. He's giving away $100 million worth of Facebook shares to Startup: Education, a new foundation he has started and on whose board he will sit. The foundation, in turn, will sell the shares for cash in what's known as the ''secondary market,'' a nebulous world where big-time investors buy into companies before they go public -- through the back door.
It turns out that there is a robust market for Facebook shares, even though most people can't buy them. The going price has been about $76 a share, The Financial Times reported last month, implying a market value of $33 billion. Dozens of employees have sold their shares in the secondary market.
Elevation Partners, the buyout firm that counts Bono of U2 as a partner, paid $120 million for Facebook shares in June at an implied valuation of $23 billion. If the secondary market is accurate, Elevation has already made a pretty penny.
And Yuri Milner, a Russian entrepreneur, has managed to amass a 10 percent stake in Facebook largely through the secondary market. His Digital Sky Technologies paid $200 million for a 2 percent stake, then raised that amount by buying up shares from employees.
The party may soon be ending. Once more than 500 individuals or institutions own shares in Facebook, securities laws mandate that the company go public. Google staged an I.P.O. in part because it hit that same threshold.
But all this share counting raises a new question: Is Mr. Zuckerberg's $100 million donation really worth just that?
Facebook isn't saying how Mr. Zuckerberg, or the New Jersey school system, plan to value his shares. (Cynics have suggested that the donation is a publicity stunt to polish Mr. Zuckerberg's image ahead of Friday when ''The Social Network,'' a fictionalized story of Facebook's founding, opens in theaters. Give the guy some credit, he just gave $100 million to a needy school system.)
People involved in the donation process say that the Facebook shares pledged will be worth $100 million based on the company's own internal valuation, not the value assigned by the secondary market.
It's probable that Mr. Zuckerberg's valuation of the shares will be much lower than that of the secondary market. As a result, the donation might ultimately be worth even more than his initial pledge once the foundation seeks to sell those shares, possibly over a period as long as five years.
And indeed, a look at the secondary market suggests that shares frequently trade at a premium to their real value -- because there are so few of them.
The topic has ignited quite a bit of debate on the Internet, including on sites like GigaOm.
''Minority investment evaluations aren't real,'' David Heinemeier Hansson, a partner in the software developer 37Signals, contended on his blog, adding that Facebook's secondary market valuation was ''entirely based on what starstruck minority investors have paid for a tiny slice of the company.''
That prompted Joel Spolsky, another software developer, to reply that Mr. Hansson's post was ''so economically bizarre and incorrect that I don't even know where to start. It's like you wrote a blog post arguing that it is incorrect to refer to a five-foot-tall boy as five feet tall because he's often sitting down. Every single day every single public company in the world is valued by the last share traded, usually for a tiny fraction of the company.''
In truth, Mr. Hansson is probably right. With so few shares available, it's hard to extrapolate Facebook's real market value. Microsoft directly invested $240 million for a slice of Facebook two years ago, valuing the social network at $15 billion. That might have been accurate -- or might not have been. After all, Microsoft's deal was partly a defensive move meant to block Google from forming a strategic alliance with the company.
Of course, one of the secondary market's great disadvantages is that a company like Facebook doesn't have to disclose its financials, so all these valuations are a bit of a guessing game.
But every stock sale in the secondary market has to be blessed by Facebook: it has the right of first refusal to buy the shares itself, and has used that provision to prevent shares from getting in the wrong hands, according to a person briefed on one such transaction.
What Facebook will ultimately be worth -- $23 billion? $33 billion? $3 billion? -- is anyone's guess. But given the immense interest in the company, it's hard to imagine that Mr. Zuckerberg wouldn't be able to find $100 million in cash for some of his shares. The question is, how many will he have to give up?

HEADLINE: Maker of BlackBerry Introduces a Tablet

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- Research In Motion, the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, introduced its first tablet computer on Monday at a developers' conference in San Francisco. But in a return to its roots, the company said that the new device, the BlackBerry PlayBook, would be aimed mainly at business users. 
After popularizing wireless e-mail, R.I.M. has ceded much of its leadership in the smartphone market to Apple and phones based on Google's Android operating system.
The introduction of a tablet computer will not end criticism from some analysts that R.I.M. is now playing catch-up with Apple. But in a bid to distinguish the PlayBook from Apple's iPad, Michael Lazaridis, R.I.M.'s co-chief executive, said that the new tablet contained several features requested by corporate information technology departments.
In an address to conference attendees, Mr. Lazaridis called the PlayBook ''the world's first professional tablet'' and repeatedly emphasized that it was fully compatible with the special servers that corporations and governments now used to control and monitor employees' BlackBerry devices.
While the company offered some specifics about the new device, it left many questions unanswered, most notably the tablet's price. The company was also vague about its release date, indicating only that it would be available early next year.
Among the PlayBook's novel features are outlets that allow it to display material on computer monitors or television sets, but Mr. Lazaridis made no effort to use them during his presentation. As animations showing the device's features appeared above him on a giant screen, he did little more with the PlayBook in his hand than switch it on.
''It's a very real product,'' said Charles S. Golvin, principal analyst with Forrester Research. ''But obviously it's very much a work in progress.''
Perhaps responding to criticisms that the operating system for R.I.M.'s phone is outdated, the PlayBook will use a new operating system developed by QNX Software Systems, a company R.I.M. acquired from Harman International earlier this year.
The new device can also display Web pages created using Adobe's Flash software, a capability not found on the iPad. To underscore that point, Shantanu Narayen, the president and chief executive of Adobe, appeared on stage with Mr. Lazaridis.
While R.I.M.'s phones and tablet will have incompatible operating systems, Mr. Golvin expects that outside software application developers will work around that issue by using Flash, as well as standard Web page protocols.
R.I.M. has lagged well behind Apple in terms of the number of applications available for its hand-held devices. But immediately after the PlayBook announcement, Amazon said that it would introduce a Kindle e-book application for the PlayBook.
Unlike the most expensive iPads, the PlayBook cannot connect directly to cellular networks. Users will be able, however, to connect to the Internet through a wireless Bluetooth connection to their BlackBerrys or by using Wi-Fi networks.

HEADLINE: Obama Puts Campaigning Back on His Agenda

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On a Monday night in July, President Obama's political advisers gathered for their weekly strategy session in a small, windowless, wood-paneled room in the West Wing. After 18 months marked by legislative victories and political setbacks, the question before them was how to re-energize the Democratic base -- particularly young people who turned out in droves in 2008.
When Mr. Obama steps onto Library Mall at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Tuesday for an old-fashioned get-out-the-vote rally, it will mark a return -- albeit a limited one -- to campaign mode for the president on a campus where more than 17,000 turned out to see him in the final, heady days of his White House run. Two years later, his political clout diminished, Mr. Obama is trying to recapture that magic.
Whatever effect he has, the public face of Mr. Obama's campaigning masks a White House political operation that some Democrats say is not nearly as focused or driven as the machine that carried Mr. Obama to the presidency in the first place. 
Responsibility and authority are divided among a group of aides, some of them also consumed with the complexities of governing. The Obama White House has no Democratic version of Karl Rove, who held a tight rein over Republican Party politics from his perch inside the White House when George W. Bush was president.
David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, has signaled that he will leave the White House next year to concentrate on Mr. Obama's re-election. David Plouffe, who ran the 2008 campaign, has had only a limited role since then, and it is not clear what role he will play if, as expected, he eventually moves into the West Wing.
The White House official with the strongest credentials when it comes to running a Congressional midterm election -- Rahm Emanuel, who returned Democrats to power in 2006 as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- is wrapped up at the moment in his own deliberations about whether to run for mayor of Chicago and is expected to announce his decision as early as Friday. And even before that issue came up, he was busy managing everything from Mideast policy to legislative affairs in his job as White House chief of staff.
Mr. Emanuel does not attend the Monday night strategy sessions; he has given oversight of the White House political operation to his deputy, Jim Messina, who also has policy responsibilities. But party leaders say that when they make requests for the president's time -- to attend a fund-raiser, or send an e-mail solicitation -- nothing happens until Mr. Emanuel signs off.
Mr. Obama does not get regular political briefings the way he does, say, on the economy or the war in Afghanistan; rather, Mr. Messina updates the president on developments during the morning meeting with senior advisers. When Mr. Obama is campaigning on the road, Mr. Messina fills him in on local races.
''The president is not a natural consumer of polling cross-tabs the way some previous presidents are,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's communications director, who also attends the Monday night sessions. ''He is very committed to doing everything he can, he is interested in how these people -- many of whom are his friends -- are doing. But he has too much on his plate to focus on politics full time.''
There have been tensions with members of his party on Capitol Hill over whether Mr. Obama is more interested in advancing his legislative agenda than protecting vulnerable Democrats, though party leaders say the White House has been far more responsive to them in recent months. Democrats are loath to criticize Mr. Obama's political shop publicly. One said the team was ''on a learning curve,'' particularly in the early days of the administration, when ''politics wasn't their priority.'' And supporters say pitfalls were inevitable, if only because running a country is tougher than running for office.
''It's easier in a campaign to control the dialogue, it's easier to control your message,'' said Steven Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist. ''When you're governing, it's harder. You have the Congress, which is a big complicated thing, and outside events over which you have no control.''
Inside the White House, strategy is guided by a diffuse collection of advisers, both inside and outside the administration, who attend the Monday night sessions, as well as a separate Wednesday-night dinner meeting at the home of Mr. Axelrod. They include marquee names like Mr. Axelrod; Joel Benenson, Mr. Obama's pollster; and Mr. Plouffe, who came up with the idea for the Tuesday event in Madison, one of four old-fashioned political rallies that will take the president to Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada between now and Election Day.
Managing the White House political operation are two lower-profile operatives: Mr. Messina, whose deep ties to the Senate have taken him to Nevada several times this year to help oversee the campaign operation of the endangered Democratic leader, Harry Reid; and Patrick Gaspard, the soft-spoken political director, whose roots are in union organizing and politics in New York. Last year, Mr. Gaspard angered some Democrats when he inserted the White House into New York politics by trying to talk Gov. David A. Paterson out of seeking re-election.
Frustrations between the White House and Congressional Democrats boiled over during the summer, when Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, infuriated party leaders by suggesting that they might lose control of the House. Not long afterward, Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, paid Mr. Emanuel a visit.
''We laid out very clearly the way we wanted the president to be engaged, both operationally as well as in terms of the message, and they have been very responsive,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. J. B. Poersch, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the Obama political team had ''weathered stormy times,'' but was ''trying to be helpful.''
Mr. Messina estimates the president will raise or contribute $90 million to Democrats this cycle, including $4.5 million in contributions from Mr. Obama's own campaign coffers.
''We understand the challenges,'' he said, ''and we are doing everything we can.''
The challenge at the moment is how to get out the vote in Wisconsin and other battleground states; Mr. Van Hollen calls Tuesday's rally ''a great experiment'' for both Mr. Obama and his team.
''We know that first-time voters are difficult to bring out in midterm elections, and this will be a test of the White House's ability to motivate those voters,'' he said. ''And the message is simple: Even though Barack Obama's name is not on the ballot, the future success of his agenda and his presidency is at stake.''

HEADLINE: Corporate Loans in Europe Fell Less Steeply in August

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
Borrowing by European companies showed signs of stabilizing in August, according to data released Monday that the European Central Bank president said signaled ''a little more dynamism'' in a crucial component of the economy. 
The central bank said that loans to corporations, not including banks, fell at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in August from a year earlier, an improvement from July, when the rate of decline was 1.4 percent. Compared with figures for July, loans to companies grew 0.4 percent in the euro zone during August.
Loans to individuals continued to grow at a much faster rate than business lending, rising at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in August after an increase of 2.7 percent in July.
The European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, told members of the European Parliament in Brussels that lending was still weak, but he expressed restrained optimism about growth, which he said had been better than expected in recent months.
''We expect the recovery to proceed at a moderate pace, with a positive underlying momentum but also with continuing uncertainty surrounding the outlook,'' Mr. Trichet told the Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Analysts said it was still too early to declare a turnaround in corporate lending, an important indicator of economic health.
''Clear evidence of a turning point in loans to corporations is still more wish than reality,'' Michael Schubert, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, wrote Monday in a note.
Lending to corporations is one of the main factors that the central bank considers when setting interest rates. Mr. Schubert said the central bank was unlikely to raise its benchmark rate from a record low of 1 percent ''for a protracted period,'' an opinion shared by most analysts.
Mr. Trichet warned members of Parliament that, in the longer term, Europe was restrained by a population that was aging more than that of the United States. The low birth rate in most of Europe means that the ratio of retired people to working people is rising, straining government pension programs and creating labor shortages in some professions.
''The main difference between the U.S. and Europe is demographics,'' Mr. Trichet said, adding that the Continent needed to restructure its economy to allow faster growth. ''The advanced economies have a real problem of growth per capita.''
Mr. Trichet also issued a call for European leaders to show ''more ambition'' in ensuring that euro zone countries do a better job policing one another's spending and borrowing, to avoid future debt crises.
European Union officials need to pay more attention to governments' total debt, not just their annual budget deficits, he said.
''Public debt levels, as well as the evolution of deficits, can be a source of financial instability and contagion across countries sharing a common currency,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''The vulnerabilities of any one member can have direct effects on other members.''

HEADLINE: Slow Climb For Female Managers

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Women made little progress in climbing into management positions in this country even in the boom years before the financial crisis, according to a report to be released on Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office.
As of 2007, the latest year for which comprehensive data on managers was available, women accounted for about 40 percent of managers in the United States work force. In 2000, women held 39 percent of management positions. Outside of management, women held 49 percent of the jobs in both years.
Across the work force, the gap between what men and women earn has shrunk over the last few decades. Full-time women workers closed the gap to 80.2 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2009, up from just 62.3 cents in 1979. Much of this persistent wage gap, however, can be explained by what kinds of jobs the sexes are drawn to, whether by choice or opportunity. 
The new report, commissioned by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, tries to make a better comparison by looking at men versus women in a specific industry and in similar jobs, and also controlling for differences like education levels and age. On average, female managers had less education, were younger and were more likely to be working part time than their male counterparts.
In all but three of the 13 industries covered by the report, women had a smaller share of management positions than they did of that industry's overall work force. The sectors where women were more heavily represented in management than outside of it were construction, public administration and transportation and utilities.
Across the industries, the gender gap in managers' pay narrowed slightly over the last decade, even after adjusting for demographic differences. Female full-time managers earned 81 cents for every dollar earned by male full-time managers in 2007, compared with 79 cents in 2000.
This varied by industry, with the pay gap being the narrowest in public administration, where female managers earned 87 cents for every dollar paid to male managers. It was widest in construction and in financial services, where women earned 78 percent of what men were paid after adjustments.
Across the work force, the pay gap was also slightly wider for managers who had children.
Managers who were mothers earned 79 cents of every dollar paid to managers who were fathers, after adjusting for things like age and education. This gap has stayed the same since at least 2000.
The greater toll that parenthood appears to take on women's paychecks may help explain why, generally speaking, female managers are less likely to have children than their male counterparts.
In 2007, 63 percent of female managers were childless, compared with just 57 percent of male managers. Of those managers who did have children, men on average had more children than their women counterparts.
Female managers were also less likely to be married than male managers, at rates of 59 percent versus 74 percent, respectively.
It is difficult to determine why a wage gap exists between female and male managers, and to what extent these differences might be because of discrimination or other factors, like hours clocked. The new G.A.O. report, for example, does not try to control for hours worked, beyond broad categories like full-time or part-time status.
The report was prepared at the request of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the Joint Economic Committee, for a hearing on Tuesday on the gender gap in management jobs. The findings were based on an analysis of data from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau.
''When working women have kids, they know it will change their lives, but they are stunned at how much it changes their paycheck,'' Ms. Maloney said of the report. ''In this economy, it is adding insult to injury, especially as families are increasingly relying on the wages of working moms.''
During the recession that began in December 2007 and ended in the summer of 2009 -- generally after the data contained in this new report -- men generally bore the brunt of job losses because of the types of industries. It is still unclear how management positions might have shifted or whether women were affected differently by that.

HEADLINE: The Debate About Mammograms

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''New Treatments Are Challenging Mammogram's Need, Study Says'' (front page, Sept. 23):
Intermittent reports that question the value of mammograms fly in the face of common sense, as if ignorance were better than knowledge. Since when is later-stage treatment of any disease better than treatment done earlier?
Isn't early treatment briefer and with fewer side effects? Aren't the economic burden and emotional stress on patient and family easier to bear when treatment is earlier and less debilitating? 
Doesn't early treatment minimize the chance that malignant cells could spread to cause recurrence with its accompanying physical, emotional and financial tolls?
To delay treatment is to play with the lives of the people at risk.

Regarding the recent Norwegian study, most investigators fail to address the issue from the point of view of a single physician advising a single patient. It is all well and good to look at the societal cost of mammograms relative to the number of lives saved or not saved.
But as a practicing breast cancer surgeon for many decades, I have to sit across the desk from one patient and one family. How can I tell that patient not to have a mammogram, when that mammogram might very well save her life?
There is no question that studies like the one reported, and others before it, have yielded important information. The difficulty comes in trying to find the right path when we are faced not with 10,000 patients, but only one.
Anthony A. Goodman Bozeman, Mont., Sept. 23, 2010
To the Editor:
This is a timely issue as new health care policies begin to go into effect. As a graduate student in public health, and son of a prostate cancer survivor, I would like to point out the financial burden that excessive preventive screening tests (breast, colon, prostate) impose on our health system.
A number of other studies have supported the fact that these screenings -- often paid for by the tapped-out Medicare and Veterans Administration systems -- do not significantly decrease mortality.
Alternatively, one thing that would reduce costs would be to tailor tests to individual risk, and for Americans to understand the increasing costs of ''overscreening.''
It will also be important for the United States Preventive Services Task Force to issue and stand by further recommendations that emphasize evidence-based medicine and minimize excessive screenings.
Robert Snyder Berkeley, Calif., Sept. 23, 2010
To the Editor:
Even if accurate, the Norwegian study on the need for mammograms is medically and morally flawed. The principal purpose of a mammogram is not simply to prevent death. Rather, it is to detect cancer at as early a stage as possible to prevent the need for the very treatments that the study applauds.
These treatments, whether successful or not, are life-altering. Biopsies, lymphectomies, radiation, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, surgery and so forth are physically and mentally debilitating, traumatic, painful and expensive.
My wife's annual mammogram in August 2009 resulted in a diagnosis of breast cancer. Unfortunately, the cancer had spread, and she and our family endured a nightmarish year. Thankfully, my wife is again healthy, but the nightmare might have been worse had she not had her annual mammogram.
Howard Adler Harrison, N.Y., Sept. 23, 2010
To the Editor:
Breast cancer does not strike women of different races with equal ferocity or with the same pattern. In the District of Columbia, where I live, African-American women have a significantly lower incidence of breast cancer than white women, but they have a higher rate of death from breast cancer.
African-American women tend to get breast cancer at younger ages than white women, with tumors that are more aggressive and fast-growing, and this cancer often goes undetected in its early stages.
Last year's report from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which recommended forgoing regular annual mammograms for women in their 40s, did not disaggregate data by race. The Norwegian study just released was conducted, one assumes, among white women.
I look forward to similar broad-based studies on African, Caribbean and African-American women, to learn if the findings on the importance of mammograms remain the same. Until then, these broad generalizations need to be contextualized.

HEADLINE: A Homeowner's Lament

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I never thought I'd hear myself cheer one of George W. Bush's chief economic advisers (Glenn Hubbard, co-author with Chris Mayer of ''How Underwater Mortgages Can Float the Economy,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 19), but when you're right, you're right. 
Where is the help for responsible homeowners who are still treading water? My wife and I bought our first home in 2005, paying 20 percent down and borrowing at the market rate of 5.5 percent. Then we watched helplessly as our house lost value and our equity vanished.
Refinancing at today's rates, we'd save more than $1,000 per month, which we would mostly spend, buoying local businesses and generating tax revenue for our cash-strapped city and state. But to qualify for a new loan, we're told, we'd have to pay up front to bring the loan back in line with the diminished value of our home.
That's a double dip we can't afford.

HEADLINE: Comptroller's Race Offers Candidates With Experience, but Starkly Different Kinds

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
In the election for state comptroller, the question may come down to this: which do voters dislike more, Albany or Wall Street?
Though few people may have heard of either candidate, the race pits products of two worlds New Yorkers know all too well -- the state Capitol and the trading floor.
Harry Wilson, the Republican challenger, brings to the race a top-tier resume -- Harvard Business School, Goldman Sachs, the task force that helped President Obama rescue Detroit automakers -- along with an outsider's perspective and millions of dollars he can pour into his campaign.
But his five years as a partner at Silver Point Capital, a hedge fund that specializes in restructuring bankrupt companies, could prove a liability with voters still angry over the Wall Street bailouts and the huge compensation packages he and his colleagues are used to receiving. 
The incumbent, Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Democrat, inherited the comptroller's office -- and all of its scandals -- in 2007 after more than two decades representing Nassau County in the Assembly. He has sought to break with the corruption that has clouded the office by making state agencies more accountable and uncovering wasteful spending in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Medicaid and school districts across the state.
But in a year when the public's anti-establishment fervor seems to be growing, Mr. DiNapoli's legislative career and deep roots in Albany could work against him.
Two recent polls showed Mr. DiNapoli with a healthy lead, even though both candidates are struggling to raise their profiles among voters. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University Polling Institute placed him with 46 percent of the vote compared with Mr. Wilson's 30 percent. That survey also showed that 91 percent of voters had not formed an opinion about Mr. Wilson, and 66 percent had not formed an opinion about Mr. DiNapoli.
The race is shaping up to be a tough fight. Both sides have already released negative advertisements with insults like ''clueless'' and ''the worst of Wall Street.''
''I may not be the flashiest guy in politics these days, but I've been focused on getting the job done, and that's the kind of person that should be in this office,'' Mr. DiNapoli said.
The comptroller occupies a little-understood corner of the political universe, but it can be thought of as something akin to the state's chief financial officer. The comptroller's two main responsibilities are overseeing the state's $124.8 billion pension fund, the third largest in the country, and auditing the spending of government agencies.
The office generally attracts the public's interest only during scandals, of which there have been plenty in recent years. Alan G. Hevesi, the previous comptroller, resigned in 2006 after an uproar over a state worker running errands for Mr. Hevesi's wife. Mr. Hevesi is expected to plead guilty to a felony corruption charge after a lengthy investigation by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo into Mr. Hevesi's oversight of the state pension fund. Mr. Hevesi was accused of directing business to firms that provided financial benefits to him and his aides.
Mr. Wilson, a rosy-faced 38-year-old who revels in the discussion of discount rates, has presented himself as an alternative to Albany's history of corruption.
''Right now in New York State, we need a turnaround,'' he said. ''That's what I have a lot of experience in and a lot of credibility in.''
Mr. Wilson grew up in Johnstown, a small town 25 miles north of Schenectady, the son of a seamstress who emigrated from Greece and a bartender whose parents were Greek immigrants.
After graduating from Harvard University, he worked at financial firms including Blackstone and Silver Point, developing an expertise in corporate restructuring. As the financial crisis unfolded, he sent a blind e-mail to Steven L. Rattner, the leader of Mr. Obama's automotive industry task force, describing his credentials and offering his services. He was invited to join the team and quickly took a leading role in restructuring General Motors, earning high praise from Mr. Rattner and other members of the group.
(Mr. Cuomo's continuing pension investigation has reached Mr. Rattner, who, federal regulators and Mr. Cuomo have suggested, improperly paid off a political operative to win business from the pension fund. Mr. Rattner has denied the accusations.)
As a first-time candidate for public office, Mr. Wilson has sought to use his newcomer status to his advantage. ''We have a very narrow, very limited cross-section of society that dominates our public life and I think that leads to predictably bad outcomes,'' he said. ''Unless we get out of the current culture of career politicians, we're not going to be able to fundamentally change the way government operates.''
Mr. Wilson's fortune gives him an advantage -- he earned more than $20 million between 2005 and 2008, when he left the private sector, according to tax returns his campaign released.
He has raised about $1.4 million and has lent his campaign more than $2.25 million, leaving him more than $2.7 million on hand as of the last filing deadline in July. A spokesman said Mr. Wilson's campaign was planning to spend more than $5 million, but he declined to say how much of his own money Mr. Wilson would be willing to spend. Mr. DiNapoli has raised about $1 million since January and had about $1.8 million on hand as of July 15.
Mr. DiNapoli is betting that Mr. Wilson's hedge fund career will make him look untrustworthy, arguing that ''he comes out of a culture and value system that engaged in very reckless behavior.''
But some analysts wonder if that argument will resonate with voters on Nov. 2.
''Attacking Wall Street in New York gets you less traction than attacking Wall Street in Oklahoma,'' said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist at the State University of New York at New Paltz. ''You attack Wall Street and you're attacking the core of the New York economy.''
Mr. DiNapoli, 56, grew up in Mineola and ran his first campaign, for the school board, when he was 18. He held a seat on the board for a decade, eventually becoming its president, while at the same time rising through the ranks at the former New York Telephone Company.
He was elected to the Assembly in 1986, where he stayed until taking over the comptroller's job in 2007. In Albany, he was universally liked by his colleagues -- a rarity in the state capital -- and the Legislature selected him to succeed Mr. Hevesi.
But critics, most notably Gov. Eliot Spitzer, quickly declared Mr. DiNapoli unqualified. The vote was attacked by some as a popularity contest and held up as another example of Albany's dysfunction.
Mr. DiNapoli said that he inherited a mess at the comptroller's office, and he pointed to his efforts to clean it up, including forbidding paid intermediaries from doing business with the pension fund, which were at the center of the Hevesi scandals.
The audit is perhaps the most powerful tool of the comptroller's office, and Mr. DiNapoli's audits have uncovered more than $2.9 billion of wasteful spending and fraud.
When he lists his accomplishments, Mr. DiNapoli points to the health of the pension fund, one of only four funds in the country that were fully funded, according to a report by the Pew Center on the States.
But Mr. Wilson argued in a 53-page report published this month that the accounting system the state uses for the fund included projected investment returns that were far too optimistic, masking a shortfall of $30 billion to $80 billion.
''I don't know where he comes up with his numbers,'' Mr. DiNapoli said. ''We don't use the fuzzy math that Wall Street types use. That's why we continue to have the best-funded pension plan of any pension plan in the nation.''
Mr. DiNapoli faces his own distinct challenges. In April, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that his sprawling investigation of the state pension fund had reached Mr. DiNapoli's office.
No evidence has surfaced to suggest that Mr. DiNapoli has benefited improperly from the pension business, and yet he has been forced to deny that he has done anything wrong.

HEADLINE: Struggle, and Snub, for a Young Brazilian

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
LONDON
The young Brazilians are everywhere. Their talents are sought by teams the world over. Their home clubs seem little more than incubators, rearing them fast and selling them abroad in their teens.
Some, like Ronaldo, Romario, Ronaldinho and Kaka, grow into fine peacocks.
Some are broken along the way, or grow too big for their shoes. 
And some are evolving right now in far-off leagues. Think Andre (Dynamo Kiev), Alexandre Pato (A.C. Milan) or Philippe Coutinho (Inter Milan). All were named to Brazil's squad, the Selecao, for two international games next week.
But Neymar, perhaps the most compelling player of the new generation, was not.
A month after his spectacular scoring debut for Brazil against the United States, Neymar, 18, was left off the roster.
''We are not trying to be extra harsh on someone,'' Mano Menezes, Brazil's new coach, said. ''But we all agree that the brilliant style of football showcased in the last months should be the trademark of Neymar. If that returns, he will return to the Selecao.''
Neymar has been struggling to find his best form and ''had some problems off the pitch,'' Menezes said.
The coach is being kind. Neymar is in danger of burning out before breaking out. In the last two weeks, he has thrown a tantrum that ended with his club coach, Dorival Junior, being dismissed for trying to discipline him.
Dorival landed a new job, as coach at Atletico Mineiro, before anyone could say the word compensation. And that is the way it is in Brazil, where the trainers hop around the coaching carousel and switch jobs before the growing youths can finish their apprenticeships at any one club.
Mineiro is Dorival's 12th stop in a seven-year coaching career.
Santos is Neymar's home club, just as it once was Pele's -- his one and only Brazilian squad, where he played more than 1,000 games. But while Pele is one of those imploring Neymar to stay at Santos, for his own sake, suspicions are growing that he will be in Europe by the January transfer period.
Money is only part of the problem.
''We are creating a monster in Brazilian football,'' another much-traveled Brazilian coach, Rene Simoes, said last week. ''Someone has to educate him for the good of sports.''
Simoes, 57, has a different view of the world than does Neymar. It is the view of a man whose specialty has been in coaching youths, boys and girls, in Brazil, Iran, Jamaica and Costa Rica.
He has not had responsibility for Neymar's meteoric rise. But like everyone from the head of state down, Simoes has opinions on what is good, bad and apparently ugly in the young man with the world at his feet.
Neymar compares to Pele in 1959, or Diego Maradona in 1976. The fledgling might mock senior pros with the ball at his feet, but the fast track to fortune is laden with traps. He might be injured, he might fall to temptations, he might become exploited.
His outburst toward Dorival was not in itself monstrous. Neymar wanted to take a penalty kick, but his coach and team captain gave the kick to somebody more experienced, and Neymar threw a foul-mouthed fit.
It happens. A boy in a man's game is usually put in his place in the confines of the team camp, and we hear no more about it.
This is a young man, however, whose every action is on camera. The nation watches, debates, chastises, lauds. The fear that he might develop habits more like Maradona's than Pele's exercises the minds of a country where soccer is so ingrained.
Discipline Neymar, and be seen to be doing so, was the cry.
So Santos issued a statement: ''The club will demand profound changes in his behavior, on and off the field. The club will support the player so that this moment of difficulty can be overcome.''
The statement said there would be a fine and a one-game ban. How big the fine was, Santos would not say. It was most likely a slap on the wrist to a young man who came into millions some time ago.
Just how does Santos reform this man-child without tampering with the free spirit that makes him the biggest meal ticket in the club's recent history?
The day after the tantrum, Neymar did what teenagers today generally do. He used his Twitter page to apologize to the coach (whom he addressed as ''professor''), to his parents, to the fans. ''It's all good,'' he posted on Twitter. ''We are together.''
The togetherness lasted one week. When Dorival benched Neymar for a second match, the Santos president removed the coach. Neymar returned and fired a goal against Corinthians, but Santos lost the game, 3-2, last Wednesday.
Poor, rich, adolescent Neymar took some blame for that loss.
His form is bound to fluctuate, but who can guide him through it? Last June, July and August, there was an uproar because Chelsea, dealing with Neymar's parents and his agent, is believed to have tried to transfer him without the approval of Santos.
The club threatened to report Chelsea for an illegal approach, and Chelsea, which has had enough threats in that regard, backed off. Santos's president, Luis Alvaro, triumphantly announced that he would keep Neymar in Brazil for years to come. He tripled his salary and now seeks global marketing to recoup the cost.
Santos thus hopes to reverse the trend that has brought every great Brazilian to Europe for decades. With the World Cup scheduled to arrive in 2014 and the country's economy improving, Brazilians hope to enjoy the fruits of their own embryonic superstars.
We will see. Reports persist that Chelsea will be back next year and could be outbid for Neymar by Juventus.
Neymar's countrymen Coutinho and Pato already play in Italy. The three are forecast to be the new trident of Brazil's World Cup squad.
Being abroad is not easy, however. Pato, sold to Milan as a 17-year-old, was married and divorced before his 21st birthday this month. His bride, the actress Sthefany Brito, cited soccer as the culprit, for occupying too much of his time.

HEADLINE: Census Data Shows, in New Ways, How the Recession Hit New Yorkers

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The nation's economic collapse jolted many New Yorkers into financial distress, driving some into poverty and dependence on food stamps and unemployment benefits and even altering their living arrangements between 2007 and 2009, according to census data released Tuesday that offered the first extensive measure of how the city weathered the recession.
Although New York City has fared better than the country as a whole, recording smaller increases in poverty and smaller declines in household income, more subtle indicators, like the rise in the number of New Yorkers living in homes without kitchens, underscore the struggles confronting many. 
The Census Bureau's 2009 American Community Survey also found that from 2007 to 2009, the income of single people in the city shrank the most among New Yorkers; the poverty rate edged up among people 15 to 64 years old; both parents were in the work force more often; home values dipped; the share of renters increased compared with owners; more renters were paying over 35 percent of their income on housing; and a smaller share said they owned two vehicles.
The proportion of very rich and very poor New Yorkers rose slightly, and the gap between them remained higher in New York than in any other state, and, in Manhattan, higher than in any other county in the country.
''We haven't seen what happens when unemployment benefits and other cushions fall away and about whether we're seeing another version of what happened in the Great Depression -- starting to build up this enormous cohort of people who have been out of work for a long period of time,'' said David R. Jones, the president of the Community Service Society, an antipoverty group.
The results confirmed suggestions by sociologists that the sluggish economy had a broader impact on the way people lived. The proportion of women in the city who had never married crossed the 40 percent threshold in 2009 (men hit 46 percent), the number of women 20 to 34 who gave birth during the preceding year declined, and more people were living with roommates or unmarried partners.
While the poverty rate remained largely unchanged in the city, it rose in New York State to 14.2 percent in 2009 from 13.8 percent in 2008 (according to a different census survey released this month, it climbed in the state to 15.8 percent from 14.2 percent) and in New Jersey to 9.4 percent from 8.8 percent (although New Jersey was among only five states in which the rate was below 10 percent).
In the city, the poverty rate ranged from a low of 6 percent among non-Hispanic whites on Staten Island to a high of 36 percent among Hispanics in the Bronx. It was 18.7 percent over all in 2009.
''We strengthened our safety net and made unprecedented efforts to expand job training and support the entrepreneurs in our city who have created 1 in 10 of every new job in America so far this year,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.
Earlier this year, the city said its own more sophisticated measure of poverty classified 22 percent of New Yorkers as poor in 2008, when the Census Bureau put the official figure at 17.6 percent. Officials would not speculate on what the 2009 rate would be by the more complex measure that takes account of costs like commuting and day care and benefits like tax credits.
''The official measure does not include much of what has been done to cushion the blow of the recession on low-income families,'' said Mark K. Levitan, poverty research director for the city's Center for Economic Opportunity. ''The new and expanded tax credits and the large increase in food stamp participation don't get counted in the official measure; they will get counted in ours.''
Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, said the rising raw numbers and percentages of city residents living below the federal poverty line ($17,600 for a family of three) and the shrinking income of many New Yorkers were ''the latest proof that low-income, hungry and even middle-class New Yorkers are suffering mightily in this recession, even as the ultrarich become even wealthier.''
Jilly Stephens, executive director of City Harvest, cautioned that ''all indicators show that demand for emergency food isn't static. It's going up.''
The proportion of residents receiving food stamps in 2009 rose to 17.2 percent from 14.9 percent in 2008 and 13.3 percent in 2007.
The share with no health insurance declined to 4.5 percent from 5.2 percent, the result of government programs' picking up the slack.
Home values have plunged by double digits since 2006 in the suburbs, but they have dropped less in the city, to an average of $517,900 in 2009 from $537,600 in 2008. In the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan, they barely changed.
Median household income was lower in 2009 than it was in 2007, dipping in the Bronx to $32,893 from $35,341 and on Staten Island to $66,292 from $69,309. But the median income was unchanged in Brooklyn at $43,166, in Manhattan at $68,706 and in Queens at $55,120. The citywide median was $50,033.
The American Community Survey is a separate measurement from the 2010 census, which will be released next year.

HEADLINE: Ancient Italian Town Now Has Wind at Its Back

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
TOCCO DA CASAURIA, Italy -- The towering white wind turbines that rise ramrod straight from gnarled ancient olive groves here speak to something extraordinary happening across Italy.
Faced with sky-high electricity rates, small communities across a country known more for garbage than environmental citizenship are finding economic salvation in making renewable energy. More than 800 Italian communities now make more energy than they use because of the recent addition of renewable energy plants, according to a survey this year by the Italian environmental group Legambiente.
Renewable energy has been such a boon for Tocco that it makes money from electricity production and has no local taxes or fees for services like garbage removal.
A quintessential Italian town of 2,700 people in Italy's poor mountainous center, with its well-maintained church and ruined castle, Tocco is in most ways stuck in yesteryear. Old men talking politics fill gritty bars, and old women wander through the market. The olive harvest is the most important event on the calendar. 
Yet, from an energy perspective, Tocco is very much tomorrow. In addition to the town's wind turbines, solar panels generate electricity at its ancient cemetery and sports complex, as well as at a growing number of private residences.
''Normally when you think about energy you think about big plants, but here what's interesting is that local municipalities have been very active,'' said Edoardo Zanchini, in charge of Legambiente's energy division. ''That this can happen in a place like Italy is really impressive.''
Italy is an unlikely backdrop for a renewable revolution. It has been repeatedly criticized by the European Union for failing to follow the bloc's environmental directives. It is not on track to meet either its European Union-mandated emissions-reduction target or its commitment to get 17 percent of its total power from renewable sources by 2020, experts say.
Currently, only 7 percent of Italy's power comes from renewable sources.
But the growth of small renewable projects in towns like Tocco -- not only in Italy, but also in other countries -- highlights the way that shifting energy economics are often more important than national planning in promoting alternative energy.
Tocco was motivated to become an early adapter because Italy already had among the highest electricity rates in Europe, and nearly three times the average in the United States, and it could not cope with the wild fluctuations in fossil fuel prices and supply that prevailed during the past decade.
At the same time, the costs of renewable energy have been falling rapidly. And as in much of Europe, the lure of alternative power here was sweetened by feed-in tariffs -- government guarantees to buy renewable electricity at an attractive set price from any company, city or household that produces it.
In the United States, where electricity is cheap and government policy has favored setting minimum standards for the percentage of energy produced from renewable sources rather than direct economic incentives like Europe's feed-in tariffs, stimulating alternative energy has been only mildly successful. But in countries where energy from fossil fuels is naturally expensive -- or rendered so because of a carbon tax -- and there is money to be made, renewable energy quickly starts to flow, even in unlikely places like Tocco.
With its four wind turbines (two completed in 2007 and two last year), Tocco is now essentially energy independent from a financial standpoint, generating 30 percent more electricity than it uses. Production of green electricity earned the town 170,000 euros, or more than $200,000, last year. The town is renovating the school for earthquake protection and has tripled the budget for street cleaners.
Kieran McNamara, Italy desk officer for the International Energy Agency, said that although small renewable energy projects were not enough to sustain an entire industrial economy like Italy's, they were important.
''These small projects have their own intrinsic value and make a very, very positive contribution in countries where electricity prices are high,'' Mr. McNamara said.
High electricity prices in Italy are a result of various forces, according to the International Energy Agency: Italy has almost no fossil fuels of its own, and until last year, it banned nuclear power plants; new plants will take a decade to build even if strong public opposition can be overcome. Although Italy has officially opened the former state electricity monopoly, Enel, to private competition, the country does not yet have a functioning market, the energy agency has found.
Large renewable projects are still rare in Italy compared with other European countries because Italian planning and permitting procedures are so complicated.
The type of renewable energy coming from small towns like Tocco depends on local resources. In the northern Alpine counties there is a heavy reliance on hydropower and the burning of agricultural waste. Italy's scorching south tilts a bit more toward solar, although wind, too, is important there because it is by far the most cost-effective renewable technology, the energy agency said.
Tocco itself was primed for success. In a mountain valley that serves as a thoroughfare for passing winds, Tocco was chosen as the site for an early European Union demonstration project in wind power in 1989. It had two inefficient wind turbines installed that lasted about a decade and were not replaced, meeting at best 25 percent of the town's electricity requirements. Residents called them ''sacks of noise.''
But in recent years, with improved technology, silent turbines and a meager public purse, town officials took another look at wind.
''We knew what we were doing and where to put them,'' said Riziero Zaccagnini, the town's popular blue-jeans-clad mayor, who came back from studies in Rome to start agitating for new turbines and was elected in 2007.
As is common in both Europe and the United States, the new turbines are owned and operated under a contract with a private energy company. The company installed the turbines and sells electricity to the national grid. Tocco profits because the company leases the land on which the turbines stand and gives the town a cut of the profits it makes from selling electricity generated with local wind.
Though more electricity is produced than consumed in Tocco, its residents do not use the electricity it produces directly because relying entirely on local wind energy could leave the town vulnerable to blackouts during periods of calm.
Impressed with their new turbines, Tocco's residents have lately turned to renewable resources to resolve other civic problems, like a financial scandal at the town's ancient cemetery, a riot of pastel stucco tombs, festooned with flowers and photographs of departed elders. In the past decade, one management company went bankrupt and another absconded with residents' upkeep fees.
An installation of solar panels now lights walkways, powers the office and generates an income of 1,500 euros a year, or $2,000, to pay for maintenance. The project has also created new types of work for local electricians.
A growing number of wealthier homeowners are paying these experts to install solar panels. The stucco home of Domenico Marini, a dental technician, has roof panels in addition to a koi pond and garden gnomes. His monthly electricity bills have dropped to $0 from as much as $700.
Tocco has won awards from international environmental groups for its efforts in renewable energy. But, said Mayor Zaccagnini, that is not really a strong motivation:
''We've gotten lots of kudos from outside, but people here care more that we now have money to fill potholes.''

HEADLINE: Lifeline for Refugees

 BODY:
Thousands of elderly and disabled refugees who receive cash assistance from the Social Security Administration are in danger of losing that lifeline. Their eligibility for benefits expires on Friday. Congress has granted temporary extensions before. It needs to do so again. 
The welfare overhaul adopted in 1996 set limits on the time that refugees can receive Supplemental Security Income. Noncitizens normally do not qualify for payments, but refugees, who fled torture and war and could not work because of old age and infirmity, were among those granted an exception on the condition that they become citizens within seven years. That deadline came too quickly for some who were unable to pass the citizenship test in time. Many were homebound and had trouble negotiating paperwork or affording the fees. Others were stuck in limbo because of administrative backlogs.
Protecting the safety net for these immigrants -- who include victims of sex trafficking, Jews who were persecuted in Russia, Hmong tribesmen who fought for the United States in Vietnam, Kurdish victims of Saddam Hussein -- has been a bipartisan effort. President George W. Bush urged Congress in 2008 to extend eligibility for two years.
Today, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is seeking a one-year extension to help 5,500 refugees who are about to be cut off. The bill is expected to cost about $22 million, and it would be more than offset by a fee collected for unemployment fraud. It would apply only to those who received benefits through the 2008 extension; new refugees must still meet the seven-year deadline.
At one time, seeking refuge in the United States was the last chance of survival for these people. This country rightly opened its doors. Now Congress needs to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected.

HEADLINE: A Vision of a Park on a Restored Los Angeles River

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- On a recent Monday morning, Lewis MacAdams, a 65-year-old poet, was standing on the roof of a sheriff's department garage on the edge of downtown.
He pointed east to the Los Angeles River, a waterway that once flowed freely. In the 1930s, the 50-mile river was channelized -- turned into little more than a concrete drainage ditch -- to protect surrounding neighborhoods from flooding.
As Mr. MacAdams watched, a steady stream of water flowed along the concrete sluice on its way to Long Beach Harbor. 
Twenty-five years ago, Mr. MacAdams founded Friends of the Los Angeles River, a group dedicated to returning the river to its natural state, which he sees as an artistic, environmental and architectural necessity.
Since then, there have been some successes, including the creation of the 32-acre Los Angeles State Historic Park, which opened in 2006 just downhill from Dodger Stadium.
Now Mr. MacAdams is hoping to make his biggest move yet, transforming a 130-acre rail yard on the other side of the river from the Los Angeles State Historic Park into a public park that would also function as a flood detention basin.
The idea is that on a few days each year, the river would overflow into the yard. The rest of the year, the land would be a park, a boon to a city that has just eight acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, compared with 26 acres in Portland, Ore., and 31 in San Diego, according to the Urban Land Institute.
The yard is used by the Union Pacific Railroad to transfer containers from trains to trucks and back again, a function that earned it the nickname Piggyback Yard.
Last year, Mr. MacAdams created a coalition of three architecture firms -- Michael Maltzan Architecture, Perkins & Will and Chee Salette Architecture Office -- and a landscape architect, Mia Lehrer. Working without charge, they proposed a park with soccer fields; miles of paths for walking, running and biking; nature trails; an orchard; a sculpture garden; playgrounds; picnic areas; and large, earth-formed gathering spaces. The Piggyback Yard, in its new incarnation, might bear the slyly altered name Piggy Backyard.
As in many cities, the park would benefit from public-private partnerships. ''The park would increase the value of the land around it,'' said Marc Salette of Chee Salette, ''which in turn would help pay for the creation of the public space.''
Developers would have an opportunity to build live-work housing units on the part of the site nearest the Brewery Art Colony, an existing arts community. They would also be invited to build commercial buildings, which would adjoin a light industrial, ''clean tech'' corridor proposed by the city, and an emerging biotechnology development at the nearby University of Southern California medical campus.
In that way the park would start to tie together parts of the city separated not just by the sprawling rail yard, but by the railroad tracks and freeways that surround it, the architect Michael Maltzan said.
The Union Pacific Railroad, based in Sacramento, has no plans to give up the site, said Aaron Hunt, a spokesman for the company. Mr. Hunt said that the yard, which the company calls the Los Angeles Transportation Center, was in use ''24 hours a day, 365 days a year.''
''We plan to continue to use it as often in the future as we have in the past,'' Mr. Hunt said.
On the recent Monday, a handful of trucks moved around the yard. Mr. MacAdams says he believes it is operating well below capacity. ''This is not the highest and best use of this land,'' he said.
Carol Armstrong, director of the Los Angeles River Project Office for the city's Bureau of Engineering, said that the city's master plan for river revitalization, adopted in 2007, did not focus on Piggyback Yard. ''We were told at the time that the railroad wasn't interested in moving,'' Ms. Armstrong said. She said she had since learned that the yard ''may be underutilized.''
Ms. Armstrong said that she could not take an official position on it because ''the city can't speculate about a privately owned parcel.''
She added, however, ''This plan is exactly what we want to see.'' She applauded the designers recruited by Mr. MacAdams, saying: ''These are really talented, really great people, who would normally be busy -- but there was an economic downturn. That made them a little more available, and I think the river really benefited from the product they came up with.''
To get anywhere with efforts to create a new park, Mr. MacAdams said he would need support from politicians. ''To even meet with Union Pacific, you need to be at least a United States senator,'' he said. He acknowledged that there had been some success with the railroad, which had owned the land on which the State Historic Park was built.
Help could come from another quarter of the federal government. In July, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the Los Angeles River navigable, a designation that allows the E.P.A. to make improvements to the river under the provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act.
To Mr. MacAdams, that is a positive development. It releases the river from the control of the Army Corps of Engineers, which had been in charge since the concrete was poured more than half a century ago.
The transformation of the rail yard into a park ''may not happen in my lifetime,'' he said, adding that someone had to start the process. ''You're never going to see 130 acres under one owner again,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Index Slips Lower

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
September consumer confidence in the United States slipped to its lowest levels since February, driven by a deteriorating labor market and business conditions, according to a private report released Tuesday. 
The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 48.5 points in September, from a revised 53.2 in August.
Inflation expectations eased slightly, even after the Federal Reserve said it was ready to take action to keep yields down in an effort to stimulate growth. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations edged down to 4.9 percent, from 5.0 percent the previous month.
The median of forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters was for an overall September reading of 52.5. Forecasts ranged from 48.0 to 55.0.
The August reading was revised down slightly from an original 53.5.
The expectations index slipped to 65.4 from 72.0 last month, and the present situation index slipped to 23.1 from 24.9 in August.
Consumers' labor market assessment also worsened. Those who said jobs were ''hard to get'' rose to 46.1 percent from 45.5 percent, while the share that described jobs as ''plentiful'' decreased to 3.8 percent from 4 percent.
Also, single-family home prices fell in July, and were seen stabilizing near the lows without the homebuyer tax credit that ended in April, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shillerhome price indexes showed Tuesday.
The composite index of 20 metropolitan areas declined 0.1 percent in July from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, as expected in a Reuters poll. The dip followed a 0.2 percent June rise, which was revised down from a 0.3 percent increase.
Unadjusted, the 20-city index gained 0.6 percent after June's 1 percent gain. A 0.4 percent rise was expected.
Home prices in the 20 cities index rose 3.2 percent from July 2009, a slower annual pace than the 4.2 percent increased in June, the index reported.
Ten of the cities had annual gains, and only Las Vegas set a new low, as the impact of the homebuyer tax credit faded away, S.& P. said. But the year-over-year growth rates slowed in 16 of the cities and both the 10- and 20-city composite indexes in July from the previous month.
''While we could still see some residual support from the homebuyers' tax credit, which covers purchases closing through Sept. 30th, anyone looking for home prices to return to the lofty 2005-2006 levels might be disappointed,'' David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S.& P., said in a statement.
''Housing starts, sales and inventory data reported for August do not show signs of a robust market, and foreclosures continue,'' he said, adding ''stable prices seem more likely.''
The 20-city index showed home prices remained 27.9 percent below the peaks set in mid-2006.

HEADLINE: Russians Share Opinions of a Newly Unemployed Official

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- There were traffic jams, soaring housing costs and cries of nepotism. But there were also allowances paid to pensioners and a cleaner city.
All of this, according to some Russians, was the legacy of Yuri M. Luzhkov, who had been mayor of Moscow for 18 years until Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, fired him on Tuesday. Readers of the Russian-language blog of The New York Times were asked to discuss Mr. Luzhkov's successes and failures.
Here are some responses, as translated by the Moscow bureau of The Times: 
''I think that the firing was correct because he was so corrupt. But the way that it was done was not right or ethical. The thing is that he was not fired for carrying out his duties poorly or for economic crimes and corruption, but for dissent against the Kremlin and for being a big personality from a very old team, which may get in the way of the present-day team.
''Speaking of his achievements, it's the living standards in Moscow (as far as I understand it), allowances to pensioners and workers in city-financed organizations, cleaner city, encouragement of revival of religious life. As to the shortcomings, it is illegal destruction of historical structures.'' avis--avis
''His achievements are the allowances paid to pensioners. His shortfalls: all these notorious outdoor markets, and the huge numbers of immigrants staying here without registration, forming whole ethnic neighborhoods, and, of course, his wife's wealth, gotten from God knows where, or through the abuse of her husband's position.'' rodham
''The greatest Luzhkov achievement is the multibillion receipts of the Inteco company (belonging to his wife).'' balamutang
''Answering your question, whether it was a correct step on the part of Mr. Medvedev to fire Luzhkov, I would say that I find it wrong when presidents turn a blind eye to what is going on right under their noses, and then come to their senses all of a sudden.'' romik--g
''The worst evil of Luzhkov's legacy is the $3,000 to $5,000 price for one square meter of housing in practically any Moscow neighborhood. Such prices were in New York near Central Park, but before the financial crisis. For Russia, such prices are nothing but reckless speculation, and Luzhkov keeps Moscow apartments' doors closed for hundreds of thousands. Thousands of newly built residential houses are standing empty, rotting, waiting for buyers, and Luzhkov and his gang are waiting for God knows what but do not drop the prices.'' volodymir--k
''It was right to fire him. He has failed to manage the city. Too many systemic problems accumulated in Moscow, from traffic jams to total corruption, which is the problem of the entire establishment, though.
''Speaking of achievements, it's the social service allowances, which, of course, is more of a populist step. Shortcomings: cost of road construction in Moscow has exceeded that in Europe by five to eight times. Inability to cope with traffic jams, arbitrary selection of construction sites accompanied by the destruction of historic buildings. Violations of city construction norms. Nepotism: if the mayor's wife makes billions legally, an honest mayor has to go. A dishonest mayor like Luzhkov pretends that he has nothing to do with his wife's business. The list can be continued.
''He will not be remembered well. He is just a mediocrity of a mayor so typical of the ruling party representatives.'' fstrange

HEADLINE: The Tea Kettle Movement

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
There are actually two Tea Party movements in America today: one you've read about that is not that important and one you've not read about that could become really important if the right politician understood how to tap into it.
The Tea Party that has gotten all the attention, the amorphous, self-generated protest against the growth in government and the deficit, is what I'd actually call the ''Tea Kettle movement'' -- because all it's doing is letting off steam. 
That is not to say that the energy behind it is not authentic (it clearly is) or that it won't be electorally impactful (it clearly might be). But affecting elections and affecting America's future are two different things. Based on all I've heard from this movement, it feels to me like it's all steam and no engine. It has no plan to restore America to greatness.
The Tea Kettle movement can't have a positive impact on the country because it has both misdiagnosed America's main problem and hasn't even offered a credible solution for the problem it has identified. How can you take a movement seriously that says it wants to cut government spending by billions of dollars but won't identify the specific defense programs, Social Security, Medicare or other services it's ready to cut -- let alone explain how this will make us more competitive and grow the economy?
And how can you take seriously a movement that sat largely silent while the Bush administration launched two wars and a new entitlement, Medicare prescription drugs -- while cutting taxes -- but is now, suddenly, mad as hell about the deficit and won't take it anymore from President Obama? Say what? Where were you folks for eight years?
The issues that upset the Tea Kettle movement -- debt and bloated government -- are actually symptoms of our real problem, not causes. They are symptoms of a country in a state of incremental decline and losing its competitive edge, because our politics has become just another form of sports entertainment, our Congress a forum for legalized bribery and our main lawmaking institutions divided by toxic partisanship to the point of paralysis.
The important Tea Party movement, which stretches from centrist Republicans to independents right through to centrist Democrats, understands this at a gut level and is looking for a leader with three characteristics. First, a patriot: a leader who is more interested in fighting for his country than his party. Second, a leader who persuades Americans that he or she actually has a plan not just to cut taxes or pump stimulus, but to do something much larger -- to make America successful, thriving and respected again. And third, someone with the ability to lead in the face of uncertainty and not simply whine about how tough things are -- a leader who believes his job is not to read the polls but to change the polls.
Democratic Pollster Stan Greenberg told me that when he does focus groups today this is what he hears: ''People think the country is in trouble and that countries like China have a strategy for success and we don't. They will follow someone who convinces them that they have a plan to make America great again. That is what they want to hear. It cuts across Republicans and Democrats.''
To me, that is a plan that starts by asking: what is America's core competency and strategic advantage, and how do we nurture it? Answer: It is our ability to attract, develop and unleash creative talent. That means men and women who invent, build and sell more goods and services that make people's lives more productive, healthy, comfortable, secure and entertained than any other country.
Leadership today is about how the U.S. government attracts and educates more of that talent and then enacts the laws, regulations and budgets that empower that talent to take its products and services to scale, sell them around the world -- and create good jobs here in the process. Without that, we can't afford the health care or defense we need.
This is the plan the real Tea Party wants from its president. To implement it would require us to actually raise some taxes -- on, say, gasoline -- and cut others -- like payroll taxes and corporate taxes. It would require us to overhaul our immigration laws so we can better control our borders, let in more knowledge workers and retain those skilled foreigners going to college here. And it would require us to reduce some services -- like Social Security -- while expanding others, like education and research for a 21st-century economy.
In other words, it will require a very smart, subtle and focused plan to use our now diminishing resources in the most efficient way possible to get back to our core competency. That is the only long-term solution to our problem -- to grow our way out of debt with American workers who are more empowered and educated to compete.
Any Tea Party that says the simple answer is just shrinking government and slashing taxes might be able to tip the midterm elections in its direction. But it can't tip America in the right direction. There is a Tea Party for that, but it's still waiting for a leader.

HEADLINE: Block on Minerals Called Threat to Japan's Economy

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- A halt of Chinese shipments of crucial industrial minerals to Japan poses a threat to the Japanese economy, a top Tokyo government official said Tuesday, amid a dispute over territorial sovereignty that has damaged relations between the regional rivals.
The Chinese commerce ministry has denied that it is blocking exports of the minerals, known as rare earths, which are used in products like hybrid cars and wind turbines. 
An official at a trading house in Japan said early Wednesday, however, that there were signs that Chinese authorities were issuing new export licenses for rare earth shipments to Japan, which he said had been terminated since early last week.
An official at the headquarters of China's customs agency and an official at the Beijing municipal customs office each declined to comment.
Executives and traders in both countries have said that Chinese customs agents have blocked rare earth exports since early last week, after a diplomatic dispute over Japan's detention of a Chinese fishing trawler captain in waters claimed by both countries. Japan released the captain on Friday.
A Japanese trader in the minerals said Tuesday that customs agents were still not allowing shipments of rare earths to Japan. Traders here say that it would be extremely difficult to find other sources of the minerals if shipments continue to be held up. China mines 93 percent of the world's rare earth minerals, which can sell for hundreds of dollars a pound.
''The de facto ban on rare earths export that China has imposed could have a very big impact on Japan's economy,'' the economic and fiscal policy minister, Banri Kaieda, told a news conference Tuesday. ''We need to restore Japan-China ties, especially economic exchanges, as soon as possible.''
China's commerce ministry has steadfastly denied that China has imposed a ban on exports, which would violate World Trade Organization rules. In the United States, the United Steelworkers union filed a legal petition last month asking the White House to begin W.T.O. proceedings against China for a series of alleged violations of W.T.O. rules in exports related to green energy, and that petition singled out China's handling of rare earth exports in recent years as a particularly strong candidate for a W.T.O. case.
The Office of the United States Trade Representative has said that it would make a decision on the petition by Oct. 24, the deadline under the obscure law cited by the union.
Rare earths are used to make many products: glass, batteries, compact fluorescent bulbs and computer display screens. Demand has risen in the last decade for their use in clean energy technology, like generators for large wind turbines and lightweight electric motors for cars.
They have been crucial as Japanese automakers vie to keep the lead in fuel-efficient vehicles, turning to the minerals for the powerful electric motors that help propel gasoline-electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius, or Nissan's all-electric car, the Leaf.
Separately, Toyota Motor said it had set up a task force to handle rare earth procurements. The task force was established in response to ''the current situation'' in rare earth trade with China, said Paul Nolasco, a spokesman for the automaker in Tokyo. He declined to give other details.
An official at a trading company based in Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear if the continued restriction in shipments was the result of a backlog that might have built up over the weeklong halt or whether a longer-term ban was in place.
The Associated Press reported that Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, had acknowledged the concerns among Japanese businesses, and said that Tokyo had submitted a statement to Beijing asking it to clarify the situation.
China, predicting robust growth of its own auto industry, has placed increasingly stringent export restrictions on rare earths. Some experts predict that exporters in China could run out of quotas as soon as the end of October, although that had nothing to do with the suspension of exports last week.
While China's refusal to acknowledge a ban has puzzled some within the industry, others say an unofficial halt carries political and legal advantages. A halt to exports because of administrative needs would be harder for Japan to challenge at the World Trade Organization, which prohibits unilateral export restrictions in most cases.
On Sunday, Chen Deming, China's commerce minister, said in an interview on Chinese television that the government had complied with World Trade Organization rules by not ordering a ban on rare earth exports to Japan.
But he seemed to hint that a halt on exports might have occurred anyway when he said, ''I believe entrepreneurs, they will have their own feelings, and will do their own thing.''
There are 32 companies with rare earth export licenses in China, and 10 of them are foreign companies. Mr. Chen was not asked why foreign companies would have felt a need to stop shipments.
The dispute comes at a politically difficult time for China, with the approach of National Day on Oct. 1, the anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 after more than a half-century of Japanese incursions into the Asian mainland -- a holiday comparable to the Fourth of July in the United States.
Chinese leaders have been especially keen to play to patriotic sentiment at this time of year and to avoid backing down to foreign pressure, especially from the Japanese.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Army Seeks Overhaul In Government

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Ismail Khan contributed reporting from Peshawar, Pakistan.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The Pakistani military, angered by the inept handling of the country's devastating floods and alarmed by a collapse of the economy, is pushing for a shake-up of the elected government, and in the longer term, even the removal of President Asif Ali Zardari and his top lieutenants.
The military, preoccupied by a war against militants and reluctant to assume direct responsibility for the economic crisis, has made clear it is not eager to take over the government, as it has many times before, military officials and politicians said.
But the government's performance since the floods, which have left 20 million people homeless and the nation dependent on handouts from skeptical foreign donors, has laid bare the deep underlying tensions between military and civilian leaders. 
American officials, too, say it has left them increasingly disillusioned with Mr. Zardari, a deeply unpopular president who was elected two and a half years ago on a wave of sympathy after the assassination of his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
In a meeting on Monday that was played on the front page of Pakistan's newspapers, the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, confronted the president and his prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, over incompetence and corruption in the government.
According to the press and Pakistani officials familiar with the conversation, the general demanded that they dismiss at least some ministers in the oversized 60-member cabinet, many of whom face corruption charges.
The civilian government has so far resisted the general's demand. But the meeting was widely interpreted by the Pakistani news media, which has grown increasingly hostile to the president, as a rebuke to the civilian politicians and as having pushed the government to the brink.
After the meeting, the president's office issued a statement, approved by all the men, saying they had agreed ''to protect the democratic process and to resolve all issues in accordance with the constitution.''
A Pakistani official close to the president who was familiar with the conversation but did not want to be identified, said, ''The president made it clear that he would not leave, come what may.''
''Sanity had prevailed,'' the official added.
Since the floods, the government has defended its handling of the crisis, arguing that any government would have been overwhelmed by its scale.
Still, it is clear that General Kayani, head of the country's most powerful institution, and the one that has taken the lead in the flood crisis, has ratcheted up the pressure on the government.
Having secured an exceptional three-year extension in his post from Mr. Zardari in July, General Kayani appears determined to prevent the economy from bankruptcy. Military officers in the main cities have been talking openly and expansively about their contempt for the Zardari government and what they term the economic calamity, an unusual candor, reporters and politicians said.
''The gross economic mismanagement by the government is at the heart of it,'' said Rifaat Hussain, a professor of international relations at Islamabad University and a confidant of the military. ''And there is the rising public disaffection with the Pakistani Peoples Party under Zardari and Gilani.''
As the military demands the overhaul, the Supreme Court is also pushing the government on the issue of corruption by threatening to remove the president's immunity from prosecution, a move that would expose him to charges of corruption in an old money-laundering case in Switzerland.
The government has defied the court's demand to write a letter to the Swiss government requesting a reopening of the case against Mr. Zardari, who served 11 years in prison in Pakistan on unproved corruption charges. On Monday, the court granted an extension of two weeks for the government to reconsider its position.
Much of the rising disdain for the government has to do with the perception among the media and the public of the callous and inept handling of the floods by the nation's wealthy ruling class.
Mr. Gilani drew public ire for appearing at an ersatz camp for flood victims set up just for television cameras. It also did not help that newspapers reported that scores of cartons from the London luxury store Harrods had arrived at his residence in Lahore at the height of the flooding.
Mr. Zardari, meanwhile, was vilified for visiting his chateau in France as torrents of water wiped out millions of villagers in his home province, Sindh.
In his most recent visit to Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the international community could not be expected to provide all the billions of dollars needed to repair the flood damage, a warning interpreted here as a rebuke of the civilian government and its mismanagement.
But Washington, not unlike Pakistan's military, is caught, American officials say, because there is no appetite for a return of military rule. Nor is there desire to see the opposition politician and former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, resume power.
Mr. Sharif, who has also faced corruption charges during his career, is considered by Washington to be too close to some of Pakistan's militant groups, whose members vote in Punjab, the Sharif electoral base.
As the head of the of the main opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, Mr. Sharif is not ready to come to the fore in any case, his aides say, because he does not want to be associated with the paralysis of the current government.
Of mounting concern to the Obama administration is the potential for serious unrest if the economy unspools further: inflation by some predictions will reach 25 percent in the coming period. The price of sugar has tripled, and the cost of flour has doubled since the Zardari government came to power.
In particular, Washington wants the government to raise taxes on the wealthy landed and commercial class, a shortcoming that has become especially galling as Pakistan's dependence on foreign donors rises.
Pakistan's revenues from taxes are among the lowest in the world: only 2 million Pakistanis of a population of 170 million pay income tax, according to estimates by the United States.
A report in a leading newspaper, The News, said Monday that Mr. Gilani and 25 of his ministers, including the finance minister, Hafiz Shaikh, did not pay income taxes at all, according to sworn affidavits by the ministers to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
The alarm about the economy was first sounded by Mr. Shaikh, a former officer of the World Bank, who told a meeting of political and military leaders last month that the government had enough money to pay only two months' salaries. The economy was ''teetering on the brink'' before the floods but was now heading for the ''abyss,'' Mr. Shaikh was quoted as saying.
The military officers who attended were astounded, Mr. Hussain and others informed of the meeting said, and have pressed the government for changes, politicians and diplomats said.
As the military maneuvers for change, it is not immune from criticism. Defense spending is budgeted at 13.6 percent of total expenditures in 2011, in line with past yearly expenditures even as the civilian population suffers.
The defense budget remains beyond public scrutiny, a fact that increasingly irks the public.
''Do we even know how much it costs taxpayers each year to make possible the office, the home, the car fleets, attendants, guest houses and other amenities that are enjoyed by the army chief or even a corps commander?'' asked Babar Sattar, a lawyer who often writes about corruption.

HEADLINE: In Hearings, a Campaign For Legal Aid in Civil Cases

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
She had come to America, lured from her home in Mangalore, India, by the prospect of child care work that would pay prevailing wages and offer weekends off.
But once Juliet D'Souza began working for a family on Long Island, she had to work 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for which she was paid $600 a month, she said. The family scared her into silence by telling her that she could be arrested because she did not have a visa, she said.
''I did not know that there were laws here that could protect people like me,'' Ms. D'Souza said on Tuesday, testifying at a hearing on expanding civil legal services to the indigent. ''I thought I had no other options.'' 
Ms. D'Souza was one of five people who testified about how they had been helped out of dire situations by lawyers who represented them in civil cases, where, unlike in criminal cases, there is no unequivocal right to a lawyer.
The hearing, held at the Manhattan Appellate Courthouse, was the first in a series of four scheduled for the coming week that are being convened by Jonathan Lippman, the chief judge of New York State, who is trying to make access to civil legal services a hallmark of his tenure.
Judge Lippman has already convened a task force to prepare a report urging more financing for lawyers to represent people who cannot afford one in civil cases. Judge Lippman said he planned to deliver the report to the Legislature by Dec. 1, along with the judiciary's budget request, which, for the first time, will ask for money specifically directed toward paying for civil legal services.
With this new budgetary initiative, the judiciary's request could grow from the $2.7 billion the state awarded it for the current fiscal year. In an economy still weak, Judge Lippman acknowledged that asking the state for more money might be an uphill task.
But these hearings and the task force are part of a larger campaign to change the way people think about civil legal services, the judge said.
''There are certain fundamentals for a civil society, for a moral society,'' Judge Lippman said in an interview. ''This is one of those priorities.''
It is ''as important as funding the schools, funding the hospitals,'' the judge added.
Since 2008, there has been a 40 percent increase at the Legal Aid Society in requests for help on health care issues and an 800 percent increase in requests for help with foreclosures, according to Steven Banks, the society's chief attorney.
After about six months working for the family on Long Island, Ms. D'Souza said, she ran away. A friend connected her with Legal Aid, she said, which helped her collect the money the family owed her and helped her acquire a visa.
Melanea Richardson said that after her husband beat her, she left him and had to apply for a Section 8 voucher to afford housing. After the program awarded her a voucher, Ms. Richardson said, it then suspended it, saying she had missed a deadline.
Ms. Richardson turned to Legal Services NYC, another group that provides representation to the poor. Legal Services sued the program and got Ms. Richardson's voucher restored, she said. The outcome helped her avoid having to move back in with her husband, she said.
''If I had not had their help,'' she said, ''I would have been in a very grave situation. I would still be assaulted by my husband.''

HEADLINE: Cal Drops Five Athletic Programs for a Savings of $4 Million

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
The University of California, Berkeley, eliminated five of its intercollegiate sports programs Tuesday, two of which, baseball and men's rugby, had become particular points of pride over the years. 
The move comes at a time when athletics have faced strong criticism at Berkeley because money-losing sports have been subsidized while the academic departments have been forced to make severe cuts. The men's and women's gymnastics and women's lacrosse teams will also be dropped from intercollegiate competition after this academic year.
By going to 24 programs, the university will save an estimated $4 million a year.
''Clearly, this is a painful outcome after months of deliberations, analysis and the examination of every viable alternative,'' Cal's athletic director, Sandy Barbour, said in a statement. ''I deeply regret the impact this will have on so many valued members of our community.''
The men's rugby team has won 25 national championships since 1980. But now it will be designated a varsity club sport, which officials say will allow the team to continue playing and competing on campus but force it to become financially self-sustaining.
University administrators said the cuts would affect 163 of the university's more than 800 student-athletes and 13 full-time coaches. They vowed to honor promised scholarships to those students or help them transfer to other universities if they want to continue their athletic careers.
Only 14 of the 120 athletic programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision -- the highest level of college sports -- made money in the 2008-9 academic year, down from 25 the year before, according to the N.C.A.A.
Still, overall spending on sports has increased among universities with big-time programs, according to the N.C.A.A. In 2008-9, programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision increased their spending by nearly 11 percent over the previous year. At the same time, universities also increased their contribution to athletics by 28 percent. That spending came even as the economic recession forced institutions to make painful cuts.
Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau vowed that Cal would still field one of the most broad-based and successful athletic programs in the nation. Last year, Cal finished eighth in the Directors' Cup, which has become a benchmark for the success of athletic programs. It has also become a lucrative milestone as dozens of athletic directors and coaches have bonuses tied to their standings in the competition.
''We will retain, at 24 teams, one of the larger programs in the country at an annual cost fully consistent with the levels of support provided to our peer institutions for programs that are often smaller in size,'' Birgeneau said in the statement. ''This is not a coincidence; the leaders of this country's best universities have long understood the value of high-quality athletics programs and the extent to which they are an integral part of what defines institutional character and identity. In my opinion, the benefits of collegiate athletics, both tangible and intangible, far outweigh the cost. Although the program has been reduced in size, our commitment to Cal athletics has not.''

HEADLINE: Saying No To 'I Do,' Economy In Mind

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta, and Malcolm Gay from St. Louis.

 BODY:
The United States crossed an important marital threshold in 2009, with the number of young adults who have never married surpassing, for the first time in more than a century, the number who were married.
A long-term decline in marriage accelerated during the severe recession, according to new data from the Census Bureau, with more couples postponing marriage and often choosing to cohabit without tying the knot.
''People are unsure about their job security, and a lot of people lost their jobs,'' said Mark Mather of the Population Reference Bureau, a private research group that analyzed census figures. ''Getting married is obviously a big step and if you're not comfortable about your future, it makes sense that you'd postpone a big decision like this.'' 
Will McElroy, 26, of Atlanta, has been dating his girlfriend, Ann, for three years. They have discussed marriage, but he lost his job as a computer programmer this year and is now more focused on looking for work than planning for the future.
''Yeah, it definitely takes money to get married,'' he said, and ''being married probably means eventually buying a house and having kids, right?''
Among the total population 18 and older, the share of men and women who were married fell from 57 percent in 2000 to 52 percent in 2009 -- again, the lowest percentage since the government began collecting data more than 100 years ago. The share of adult women who were married fell below half, to 49.9 percent.
Society could be in store for a brief marriage bump if economic good times return, sociologists said, but it is likely to be a temporary reversal, at best, of a long-term downward slide.
Two factors contribute to the decline in marriage among adults ages 25 to 34, said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University: less marriage and more cohabitation, which has become far more socially acceptable, even with children.
''It's a mistake to think of all unmarried people as single,'' Dr. Cherlin said. ''Lots are living with partners.'' This is especially true, he said, among those without college degrees, who often wait until they feel economically secure enough to marry.
Joel Greiner, 31, director of counseling for the Journey, an interdenominational church in the St. Louis area, said about a third of the couples in his congregation who attend premarital classes live together before marriage, telling him they are ''testing out the waters to see if it will work and wanting to save money.''
But Mr. Greiner says the talk of economics may be cloaking the primary issue. ''It's more a fear of intimacy and fear of marriage,'' he said.
According to the federal data, the share of young adults who have never married climbed from 35 percent at the start of the decade to 46 percent in 2009.
There have long been large racial differences in marriage rates, with blacks far less likely to marry than whites, but that difference has been shrinking as cohabiting becomes more popular with whites, Dr. Cherlin said. And many young adults, he said, are postponing marriage rather than forgoing it altogether.
Mr. McElroy in Atlanta said he would definitely start thinking about a wedding once he gets a new job and the economy picks up.
''Not very romantic, is it?'' he said with a laugh.

HEADLINE: Health Industry and Fed Action Help Wall Street Rebound Quickly

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Markets in the United States on Tuesday erased most of their losses from Monday, as Walgreen led a rally in consumer staples and health companies. Investors also speculated that the Federal Reserve would buy more debt to safeguard the economy.
Walgreen, the country's largest drugstore chain, jumped 11 percent to $33.81 as earnings topped estimates. Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson lifted health care shares after the Supreme Courtagreed to hear an appeal by pharmaceutical companies seeking to block thousands of public hospitals from suing over a federal discount drug program. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.49 percent, or 5.54 points, to 1,147.70. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 46.10 points, or 0.43 percent, to 10,858.14, while the Nasdaq gained 9.82 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,379.59.
''Investors are getting more comfortable with taking some risk as it sounds like the Fed's goal is to increase inflation,'' said Eric Green, director of research at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia. ''If the economy doesn't get better, there seems to be a belief the Fed is going to stimulate through purchases. If it does get better, that's good for stocks also.''
The expectations on the Fed's actions also helped gold hit another record, as it rose $14.70 to close at $1,309.05.
The S.& P. 500 has rallied about 9 percent since the end of August, poised for its best month since April 2009 and its biggest September rally since 1939 as concern eased that Europe's debt crisis and unemployment would derail the economic rebound.
The Fed announced after its Sept. 21 meeting that it was prepared to do more to help the economy, spurring speculation that policy makers would add Treasury securities to the central bank's holdings. The central bank on Tuesday purchased $550 million of Treasury inflation-protected securities as part of a program to reinvest principal payments on its mortgage holdings into long-term government debt.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 16/32, to 101 12/32. The yield fell to 2.47 percent, from 2.52 percent late Monday.
A bigger-than-estimated decrease in consumer confidence helped fuel speculation of another round of quantitative easing. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index declined to 48.5, lower than forecast, from 53.2 in the previous month.
Endo Pharmaceuticals rallied 8.1 percent to $33.10. The company agreed to buy Qualitest Pharmaceuticals, a generic-drug maker in the United States, for about $1.2 billion in cash from the private equity firm Apax Partners.
Broadwind Energy, a maker of wind towers, surged 27 percent to $1.87 on speculation that General Electric would acquire the company, according to Pavel Molchanov, a Raymond James & Associates equity analyst. G.E. said on Monday that it had formed a joint venture with China's Harbin Power Equipment to make and supply equipment.
Amedisys dropped 16 percent to $24.02. The company, a home nursing provider, was asked by prosecutors for information related to Medicare reimbursements and billing claims by its 31 Alabama home health operations.
Monsanto fell 8.1 percent to $48.75, bringing its two-day drop to 12 percent. Initial field data on Monsanto's SmartStax genetically modified corn showed weaker-than-expected performance, the Jefferies Group wrote in a note. Separately, Nufarm of Australia reported that 2010 North American sales of glyphosate, a herbicide also sold by Monsanto, fell 44 percent over the previous year.
Investors' sentiment on stocks has fallen to panic levels, an indication that the equity market will rise over the next six to 12 months, said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. The bank has a panic-euphoria model, which declined to as low as minus 0.49 this month. In March 2009, the gauge had dropped to minus 0.46, when the S.& P. 500-stock index started a rally of as much as 80 percent on government efforts to stimulate the economy.
The measure had fallen to minus 0.36 on October 2002, when the S.& P. 500 entered a five-year rally.
''If you break below the panic line, there's a 90 percent probability that stocks will be up in six months,'' Mr. Levkovich said. ''There's about a 97 percent probability that stocks will be up 12 months later.''

HEADLINE: An Economy Tour Of Rhone Syrahs

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
AS with Yankees caps and ''Law & Order'' reruns, syrah is nowadays the property of the world. In pretty much any country that makes wine today, humans grow syrah.
Why is this? Whether in California or Chile, Tuscany or South Africa -- even allowing for the exception of Australia, which has its own long history with the grape -- people are growing syrah today largely because they fell in love with the wines of the northern Rhone Valley. They may make syrah wines that taste nothing like Rhone syrahs, but if you ask them, their inspiration was the Rhone.
Nowadays, actually, a fair number of syrahs from the northern Rhone taste nothing like Rhone syrahs, which says a lot about the fluid nature of the global wine business. Nonetheless, for a world of syrahs, we must thank the classic Rhone wines, in all their olive, thyme, violet and sizzling bacon-scented glory.
The northern Rhone itself offers many manifestations of this theme, beginning most famously with Hermitage and Cote-Rotie. Critics fluent in French, in which each noun has its gender, historically described Hermitage as the manlier of the two wines, and Cote-Rotie as the more feminine. Those who shy away from such typecasting might think of Hermitage as more burly and powerful, and classic Cote-Rotie as more focused, incisive and fine. 
Sadly, these neat divisions have largely fallen by the wayside as Cote-Roties have become ever more oaky and burly themselves. But keep these styles in mind, and throw in the untamed, unruly expression of syrah from Cornas, and you have a neat triangle of possibilities.
None of these wines are inexpensive these days. They might start around $40 for the most basic versions, but rocket steeply to well beyond $100. Fortunately, the northern Rhone is well equipped with what might be called entry-level appellations: Crozes-Hermitage, St.-Joseph and the occasional Cotes du Rhone, which is most often made with a blend of grapes but sometimes is strictly syrah, as with Eric Texier's Brezeme.
Perhaps ''entry level'' is unfairly demeaning, as good examples of these wines can be wonderfully satisfying. I regularly enjoy St.-Josephs at home, and no time more so than in the fall, when the crisp edge in the air and the colors and crackle of autumn leaves stimulate my Rhone nerve center. In the hands of superb producers like Pierre Gonon, Domaine Jean-Louis Chave and the now-retired Raymond Trollat, these wines offer all the pleasure you could want out of a northern Rhone red, lacking perhaps only the structure and complexity of the top appellations.
Personally, I've found less interest and consistency in Crozes-Hermitage than I have in St.-Joseph. In a tasting of Crozes-Hermitage back in 2006, I found the wines impressive, not because they were potentially great, but because they were true to themselves: distinctive yet unpretentious.
But since then, I've had a number of Crozes-Hermitage that did not live up to that billing. Without quite knowing what to expect, the wine panel recently gathered for a return engagement, tasting 20 bottles of Crozes-Hermitage. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Kristie Petrullo, chef sommelier at Jean Georges, and Kerrie O'Brien, sommelier at DBGB.
We found a well-mixed bag that included some very good, enjoyable wines, quite a few disappointing wines and some that were neither distinctive nor unpretentious. Over all, no question about it, we were disappointed.
''Nothing was really bad,'' Kristie said. ''They were just not exciting.''
Florence said she was expecting more finesse, while Kerrie thought too many were overly simple, one-note wines.
I would agree all around. Too many of the wines lacked an ingredient that says, ''Drink me.'' Whether this is expressed as a zesty liveliness, or as complexity and intrigue, it was absent too often. Kerrie described them over all as ''good burger wines,'' and while there is certainly honor in that, we all expected better.
Even if we did not find thrilling wines, we did identify wines that we liked, beginning with our No. 1, the 2007 Domaine Mucyn, which, at $15, was also our best value. It may be something of an anomaly, as it seems to be sold at only one store in New York City, Astor Wines & Spirits. But it is a delicious, easy-drinking wine that hits all the right notes, though I found it lacking a bit in structure and definition.
If the Mucyn proves hard to find, fear not. Our top six were ranked very closely, and the other producers are better known and well distributed. Alain Graillot year in and year out makes some of the best Crozes-Hermitage. His 2008 is perhaps a bit young, and '08 as well may be the weakest recent vintage from the northern Rhone. Nonetheless, this is a savory, structured wine that should benefit from decanting.
Mr. Graillot's son, Maxime Graillot, also makes Crozes-Hermitage, and his 2007 Domaine des Lises was our No. 3 wine. The vintage is different, so perhaps a direct father-son comparison has a few too many variables, but I was impressed by the clarity of the flavors in this wine.
Dard & Ribo is another of my favorite Crozes producers. Its wines absolutely are imprinted with the joyous ''drink me'' quality, and the 2008 was no different. It was aromatic and delicious, though, as with most of the Dard & Ribo wines, best for the short term.
Our two other favorites were the very young 2009 Laurent Combier, intense but uncomplicated, and the 2006 Bernard Ange, which was a little calmer and subtler as the wine showed the benefits of a few years of age.
Let me take a moment to call your attention to one of my favorites in the tasting, which was soundly rejected by the other panelists. I treasure their opinions but nonetheless will have the last word. It's the 2007 Silene from Jean-Louis Chave Selection, the Chave negociant arm. It was a wine that I found bursting with life, the quality lacking in so many of these bottles. My colleagues, however, suggested the wine was too acidic. Go figure.
Other bottles we rejected tasted as if they could have come from anywhere, except the Rhone. Some laid on too thick a layer of oak flavoring. Others were simply nondescript. With a world of syrahs to choose from, the least these wines could offer are the qualities that could distinguish them from the rest.

HEADLINE: Teams Win, But Fans Are Staying At Home

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
If the adage in sports that ''winning cures all'' is true, then teams fighting for a spot in the postseason, like the Atlanta Braves, the San Diego Padres and the Cincinnati Reds, ought to be selling more tickets.
With first place on the line, the Tampa Bay Rays averaged 28,400 fans, or 79 percent of capacity, for their three home games against the Yankees two weeks ago, and filled just a third of their seats on Monday night, prompting several of the team's star players to lash out at the lack of fan support.
Nearing their first division title in 15 years, the Reds drew 12,000 fans to a recent night game, their smallest crowd of the year. The Braves have had trouble filling even half their seats this month despite battling for a playoff spot.
The sight of so many empty seats at stadiums where teams are vying for a chance to play in the postseason is a glaring reminder that baseball is still not back to its prerecession heights and that professional sports leagues more broadly continue to suffer from the aftereffects of the economic downturn after years of record growth. 
Attendance across Major League Baseball is down about a third of 1 percent this year after falling in 2008 and 2009. Declines have been most noticeable in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, where the Mets, the Cubs and the Dodgers have had disappointing seasons, but also in Baltimore, Cleveland and Toronto, where attendance has slipped for several years.
With the exception of the Rays, every team in the hunt for a playoff spot this year has had its attendance rise this season. The Reds set a club record for tickets sold in August, and ticket sales for the Colorado Rockies and the Texas Rangers jumped more than 10 percent this year.
But attendance has fallen conspicuously this month in cities that have not seen a pennant in years. Part of the problem is that children are back in school and less likely to attend weeknight games. The quality of the opponent and the chillier weather can dampen enthusiasm as well.
But baseball officials and analysts say that many fans are still pinching pennies, even if economists have declared the recession officially over. With more games broadcast in high definition and the price of flat-panel televisions declining, more fans are content to watch their teams at home and perhaps save money for playoff tickets.
''It's still a hangover from previous years when everyone was worried about the economy,'' said Jon Greenberg, executive editor of the Team Marketing Report, which publishes the Fan Cost Index. ''People realize they can do without as many games.''
Baseball is not the only sport trying to regain its footing. The N.B.A. and the N.H.L. had attendance slip last season during the depths of the recession. In the N.F.L. this year, the Jets and the Giantsfailed to sell out their season openers in their new $1.6 billion stadium. A growing number of games have been blacked out on television the past two years because teams in Jacksonville, Oakland, Tampa and elsewhere have failed to sell out their home games, a rarity a few years ago.
Those teams have performed poorly on the field, and it has not helped that 17 N.F.L. teams raised tickets prices this season.
Most baseball teams in the hunt for a playoff spot, though, usually have an easier time attracting fans.
Attendance, of course, is just one indicator of fans' support. Merchandise sales, television ratings, traffic on team Web sites and spending on concessions at the ballpark are also important measuring sticks. Indeed, every team chasing a playoff spot this year has had sales of its merchandise grow and, with the exception of the Yankees, has seen its television ratings rise, too.
The Minnesota Twins, who are playing in a new ballpark and have clinched their division, have had merchandise sales jump 136 percent this year. Sales have risen more than 30 percent for the San Francisco Giants, the Rays, the Rangers, the Reds and the Yankees.
For most teams, sales are highest in the summer, particularly in places like Atlanta, before children return to school in the second week of August. The Braves also draw many fans who make trips from surrounding states. Once summer vacation season ends, attendance at Turner Field declines.
''That's been traditional, something that's part of the Atlanta market,'' said Derek Schiller, the Braves' executive vice president for sales and marketing. ''We have a bell curve, lower at the front and back ends, and much higher during the summer months.''
Schiller said that ticket sales had risen about 5 percent this season because of the team's excellent record at home, the impending retirement of Manager Bobby Cox and the introduction of new players like Jason Heyward. Spending on concessions at the park has also increased.
During their run of 14 consecutive playoff appearances that ended in 2005, the Braves were notorious for not selling out some postseason games. The novelty of making the playoffs had apparently worn off.
So far this year postseason ticket sales have risen 40 percent compared with the same point in 2005. Still, ''for teams like us that don't have 50,000 season-ticket holders, it's tough'' to sell out home games in the first round of the playoffs, Schiller said.
In Tampa Bay, the Rays' attendance at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg has declined 0.3 percent this year even though the team has one of the best records in baseball. After Monday's loss to Baltimore, Tampa Bay pitcher David Price wrote on Twitter, ''Had a chance to clinch a post season spot tonight with about 10,000 people in the stands ... embarrassing.'' Evan Longoria, the team's third baseman, told The St. Petersburg Times that the crowd of 12,446 was ''disheartening.'' The Rays drew 17,891, just under half of capacity, Tuesday night.
Team officials have talked about the need for a new stadium to attract fans. The trouble may not be the stadium, but that the Rays are a relatively new team (they began play in 1998) in a city hit hard by the recession that has many alternatives to attending a game.
''We might be a lot better baseball market than people realize, but we don't have the history,'' said Philip Porter, an economics professor at the University of South Florida, who said that the Rays were seventh in attendance when adjusting for the region's population. ''There are so many things to do in Florida. We get outside, go to the beach, so we're not as easily seduced by baseball as somewhere else.''
The Reds are perplexing because of their rich history and because their fans come from Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and beyond. Michael Anderson, a team spokesman, said the Reds did not draw well in 1990 and 1995, when they made the playoffs. Now that children are back in school, the Reds must compete with Friday night high school football games.
''Unfortunately, it's not too surprising for us,'' Anderson said, adding that the team has sold $5 tickets and $1 hot dogs, peanuts and sodas to attract price-conscious fans.

HEADLINE: Looming Loss of Seats in House Stirs Partisan Tension in Midwest

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Whatever the outcome of the fall elections, one political loser this year seems certain: the Midwest.
State population tallies, to be revealed at the end of December, are expected to show that in the coming reapportionment of Congress, seats will be lost across this region -- in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio and perhaps, experts say, Minnesota or Missouri.
''When you think about losing six seats this time around,'' said Tom Gillaspy, the state demographer of Minnesota, ''that's stark.'' Minnesota is one of 12 Midwestern states that together commanded 143 Congressional seats a century ago, but that number is predicted to shrink to 94.
Already, the worry about vanishing seats is stirring partisan tensions: whose seat will be spared and whose will be erased? Around the country, state officials have begun considering their task of redrawing Congressional districts in the coming year. But in states expected to lose a seat, the prospect of a new map (and, potentially, the demise of someone's political career) has drawn extra notice -- and a role in some midterm campaigns. 
In Illinois, which is expected to lose one of its 19 Congressional seats, John J. Cullerton, the State Senate president, sent letters this month to fellow Democrats in Congress reminding them, he said, that helping to elect a Democratic governor in November would be key to keeping their voices (and seats) in Washington. As in most states, state lawmakers and the governor here have a central role in deciding the new district boundaries.
Republican leaders, meanwhile, who hope to seize the governorship and legislative seats in this Democratic-controlled state, have been offering comparable reminders about the coming redistricting, at event after event, before their largest donors. ''For the people who write checks, this is a huge motivator,'' said Pat Brady, the state's Republican chairman. ''They understand that it is crucial.''
Amid fiercely competitive campaigns in Minnesota, too, Republicans have been warning that state Democrats -- if they hold onto both chambers of the State Legislature and win away the governor's mansion -- are quietly scheming to delete the district of Representative Michele Bachmann, a conservative Republican who started a Tea Party caucus on Capitol Hill. Ms. Bachmann is known for her outspoken, unflinching (and often televised) remarks on abortion, health care, big spending and big government.
''They will do it to Bachmann and whoever else they can,'' Michael Brodkorb, the deputy state Republican chairman, said last week. ''The Democrats will absolutely attempt to do that.''
Not so, Brian Melendez, the chairman of Minnesota's version of the Democratic Party, known as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, says; the party wants to defeat Ms. Bachmann but not by redrawing her out of existence, he asserts.
Even amid the partisan positioning, fear of diminishing political clout for the region cuts across party lines. Leaders worry that issues like protecting the Great Lakes, providing winter heat assistance for struggling families, and cleaning up old industrial sites will eventually be pushed aside, overtaken by the expanding Sun Belt's clout and its unique worries. They fret about less influence in future presidential elections; fewer Congressional seats means fewer electoral votes. And, at its simplest level, these leaders worry that fewer federal dollars will find their way to the nation's middle.
The Midwest has long watched -- and worried about -- the diluting of its political power in Washington thanks to shifts in the nation's population. Once it held more than a third of the nation's House seats, but its share has shrunk steadily since 1890.
By the time a new Congress arrives in 2013, the Midwest is expected to hold a little more than one-fifth of the seats, according to an analysis by Eric J. Ostermeier of the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. (That compares with estimates of 24.4 percent of seats held by the West, 35.9 by the South, and just 18.2 percent by the Northeast.)
In a way, Midwestern leaders say, there is little they can do. The allotment of Congressional seats is based on census counts of the states, and the population has, over decades, grown in the West and South, to the relative misery of the East Coast and Midwest.
This year, Midwestern states went to great lengths to secure some of the highest participation rates in filling out census forms of anywhere in the country, but that was apparently not enough to affect the larger trend.
A final 2010 population count of each state will be presented to President Obama on Dec. 31, and until then any predictions about Congressional seats lost and gained are based on census data from 2009 and demographic data from private companies.
Particularly because of the nation's economic and housing turmoil and because earlier data does not include deployed members of the military, experts say, some of the early predictions may prove to be wrong this time around; as late as Sunday, Election Data Services, a company that analyzes such trends, issued slightly revised predictions: that Missouri (and not Minnesota) might lose a seat and that New York might lose two (not just one) while Florida might gain two.
''The economic upheaval makes this exercise more unpredictable than it's ever been,'' said Tim Storey, a senior fellow at the National Conference of State Legislatures, who was over the weekend conducting a training seminar in Providence, R.I., for 250 state lawmakers from around the country on drawing new maps and, if need be, shrinking the number of House districts.
Still, some of the broad trends are clear, the experts say. The expected winners: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Washington. The likely losers: Louisiana; East Coast states like Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania; and a chunk across the Midwest. (Ohio, in fact, is predicted by two analysts to lose two House seats.)
''This is all going to be pretty painful,'' said J. Thomas Wolfe, executive director of the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a group that was formed in the mid-1970s when it became clear that other regions were growing in size -- and political influence. So the cold-weather manufacturing states teamed up, its leaders creating the institute and coalitions in the Senate and the House, which press for the causes of 18 states from Maine to Iowa.
For the moment, the Midwest may have some benefits overlooked in any new census figures or House count: a president from here and, for a chunk of Midwestern states, crucial status as battlegrounds in presidential election fights. Still, the signs are worrisome, Mr. Wolfe said. At its creation, the Northeast-Midwest House group included 218 seats; that number has shrunk to 174, and more will likely go lower in 2012.
The benefit of trying to work things through a caucus or a coalition is hard,'' Mr. Wolfe said, ''if the coalition is ebbing away.''

HEADLINE: Cultivating the Chinese Consumer

BYLINE: By STEPHEN S. ROACH. 
Stephen S. Roach, a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale, is the non-executive chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.

 BODY:
New Haven
ON Wednesday, the House of Representatives is set to pass legislation that would allow trade sanctions to be imposed on China as compensation for its supposedly undervalued currency. This vote comes a week after President Obama, in a private meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, was reported to have made it very clear that the United States is, indeed, prepared to take forceful actions if China doesn't budge on this critical issue. Unfortunately, forcing such a currency realignment would be a blunder of historic proportions.
In a recent meeting with Mr. Wen in New York, I framed the dispute between our two nations in a very different light. The gist of what I told him is this: The economic tensions between the United States and China arise because of two things we have in common.
First, there is our shared fixation on jobs. In the United States, we continue to struggle with high rates of unemployment and underemployment. In China, policymakers continue to worry about what they term ''social stability'' -- that is, full employment, absorption of surplus rural labor and reduced inequalities consistent with their aspirations for a ''harmonious society.'' 
Second, for both China and the United States, there are major imbalances in the percentages of gross domestic product devoted to exports, investment, consumption and savings.
These joint concerns have resulted in serious tensions that must be resolved. There are, however, two very different potential strategies to address these tensions: a major currency realignment, favored by many in the United States, or structural policies aimed at increasing China's internal private consumption.
The currency fix won't work. At best, it is a circuitous solution that would address only one of the many pressures shaping the imbalances between our two nations; at worst, it would lead to a trade war, or risk jeopardizing China's understandable focus on financial and economic stability.
Besides, in a highly competitive world, there are no guarantees that currency shifts would be passed through to foreign customers in the form of price adjustments that might narrow trade imbalances. Similar fixes certainly didn't work for Japan in the late 1980s, and haven't worked for the United States in recent years. We've allowed the dollar to fall 23 percent -- in inflation-adjusted terms -- from its early 2002 peak, against all of our trading partners; we did this in the hopes that a weaker dollar would stimulate exports and domestic production. Yet America continues to struggle with high unemployment and stagnant wages, and now has trade deficits with 90 countries around the world.
This latter point underscores the danger in politicizing this debate. Contrary to accepted wisdom, America does not have a bilateral trade problem with China -- it has a multilateral trade problem with a broad cross-section of countries.
And why do we have these deficits? Because Americans don't save. Adjusted for depreciation, America's net national saving rate -- the sum of savings by individuals, businesses and the government sector -- fell below zero in 2008 and hit -2.3 percent of national income in 2009. This is a truly astonishing development. No leading nation in modern history has ever had such a huge shortfall of saving. And to plug that gap, we're left to borrow and to attract capital from lenders like China, Japan and Germany, which have surplus savings.
If Washington were to restrict trade with China -- either by pushing the Chinese currency sharply higher or by imposing sanctions -- it would only backfire. China could very well retaliate against American exporters, and buy goods from elsewhere (a worrisome development in what is now America's third-largest export market). Or it could start to limit its purchase of Treasury securities.
The United States would then have to turn to some other nation or nations, at a higher cost, to finance our budget deficits and make up for our subpar domestic savings. The result would be an even weaker dollar and increased long-term interest rates. Worse still, as trade was redirected away from China, already hard-pressed American families would be forced to buy products that are noticeably more expensive than Chinese-made imports.
But Washington remains unwilling to address our unprecedented saving gap, and instead tries to duck responsibility by blaming China. Scapegoating may be good politics, but proposing a bilateral fix for a multilateral problem is just bad economics.
China should stay the course with its measured currency reforms, allowing the renminbi to continue to appreciate gradually and steadily over time. Contrary to the inflammatory rhetoric of China's critics, this is not ''manipulation.'' It is a reasonable strategy to anchor the renminbi to the world's reserve currency, the dollar, in an effort to maintain financial stability in an all-too-unstable world.
Nonetheless, China must address its role in fostering global imbalances. For China's people and its trading partners, consumption has long been the missing link in an otherwise vibrant economy. China's gross domestic saving rate is 54 percent of national income, the highest in the world for a major economy. But its consumption share of G.D.P. is only about 36 percent, the lowest for a major economy and about half the 70 percent ratio in the United States.
I would therefore urge China to opt for aggressive and immediate pro-consumption structural policies. Stimulating domestic consumer demand would be a far more direct -- and potentially a far less destabilizing -- way of reducing saving and trade imbalances than a currency realignment would be.
These policies should include an expanded social safety net, with a public retirement program, private pensions and medical and unemployment insurance. China should also provide major support for rural incomes through tax policy and land ownership reform, as well as enhanced initiatives to encourage rural-urban migration. And it should encourage the creation of service-oriented jobs in industries like retail and wholesale trade, domestic transportation, leisure and hospitality.
During our recent meeting, Mr. Wen openly agreed with these three pro-consumption initiatives. My hope is that such measures will be featured prominently in China's 12th five-year plan, for 2011-2016, because they could provide an important impetus to Chinese employment, personal income and consumer purchasing power.
That would be a win-win for China and the broader global economy. After all, the import share of China's G.D.P. is quite high -- 28.5 percent in 2008, a figure that suggests the Chinese are predisposed to buy foreign goods. Any increase in Chinese consumption would therefore offer a potentially powerful opportunity for American-made goods and services.
China bashers are blind to these critical points. No nation has ever devalued its way to prosperity. A weaker dollar, or the mirror image of a stronger renminbi, would be no exception to that time-honored premise. America's own economic miracle has long been defined by our ability to meet competitive challenges head on. And a China that starts to consume more would offer us precisely the opportunity we need to rise to that challenge again.
The Chinese leadership must now make the urgent choice about how to best deal with political and economic pressures coming from the United States and others. Congress has opted for the low road of misdirected currency bashing. China should take the high road by providing immediate and long-overdue stimulus to private consumption.

HEADLINE: Barnes & Noble Turns the Page

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and WEI GU

 BODY:
Barnes & Noble just finished one cliffhanger, but should brace for another. The bookseller's architect and chairman, Leonard Riggio, has survived an attempted insurrection by the uppity billionaire Ronald Burkle. But the chain operates in an industry on the edge of an abyss. It needs quickly to find a buyer or a way to turn things around.
Mr. Burkle brought needed attention to Barnes & Noble's governance defects. But his campaign, in which he didn't really offer an alternative strategy, failed to win over the roughly one-third of shareholders who weren't allied with either him or Mr. Riggio. These unaffiliated voters opted for Mr. Riggio's group of directors by a fairly wide margin. Even here, however, Mr. Burkle managed to effect change: the two winning board members were independent replacements for incumbents who had ties to Mr. Riggio and who originally sought re-election. 
Admitting at least partial defeat, Barnes & Noble put itself up for sale in August. Neither Mr. Burkle nor Mr. Riggio is a bidder -- at least not yet. But the conclusion of the acrimonious proxy battle should give fresh momentum to an auction that has drawn initial interest from some 20 parties wanting at least to leaf through the book.
Barnes & Noble has admittedly taken some baby steps to fix its business. It claims to have nabbed 20 percent of the electronic reader market with its Nook device. That's about equal to its share of physical book sales, a position it took decades to establish. And new publishing partnerships could be on the horizon. But these moves seem belated and too modest to make up for the company's steadily declining cash flow.
Price wars have intensified with major retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon. Barnes & Noble was slow to enter the digital market, hasn't closed stores fast enough and has clung to its dividend payout. Its shares have dropped faster than those of other specialty retailers. The chain may eventually be headed for the same fate as Blockbuster, the onetime video rental king that filed for bankruptcy last week. So Mr. Riggio doesn't have time to savor his victory. The next chapter in this tale may well be titled ''The Winner's Curse.''
Charity in China
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have star power, but even they may struggle to convince China's billionaires that celebrity philanthropy is a must. Chinese billionaires feel insecure about their wealth, and trustworthy charities are lacking. Still, as China's wealth gap widens, they may need to find ways to look more generous.
The Middle Kingdom is home to more dollar billionaires than anywhere except the United States, according to Forbes. But charitable giving accounted for only 0.1 percent of China's gross domestic product in 2009, versus 2 percent in the United States. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates are set to hold a banquet in China on Wednesday as part of their philanthropy-themed world tour, but some local moguls are wary.
Charity probably feels like a luxury for the first-generation super-rich, most of whom are still building their wealth in China's young, fast-growing economy. Many of them want to leave their empires to their children. Mr. Buffett, by contrast, has publicly worried about handing his offspring too much.
Nor does China make philanthropy easy. The country's charities are mostly state-controlled and aren't transparent. Some have also been hit by accusations of corruption.
Whatever the circumstances in China, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates do have one lesson to teach their billionaire counterparts: generosity makes the rich more likeable. China's growth has not reached everyone equally. Its wealth is more concentrated than in the United States, according to the World Bank. The ruling Communist Party might try to raise taxes, or dig for dirt in billionaires' past dealings, if it senses public anger is rising.
Fortunately, China's billionaires have one option many moguls don't. They can keep investing at home, and can realistically hope for high returns doing so. That has the added advantage of directly creating jobs and raising incomes, even if it doesn't count as traditional philanthropy. The rich should certainly be thinking of ways to win friends, but don't expect them to start giving like Mr. Gates.

HEADLINE: Debate in California Governor's Race

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- With polls showing a tight race and a large block of undecided voters still in play, the two major party candidates for California governor met on Tuesday in the first of three debates, with the state's economy and its deep financial problems dominating the discussion.
And while the candidates clashed, Jerry Brown, the Democratic nominee, and his Republican opponent, Meg Whitman, both seemed to recognize that there were no simple fixes for a state with a $19 billion deficit and unemployment of more than 12 percent. 
''This will not be easy,'' said Ms. Whitman, the billionaire former chief executive of eBay. ''The governor of California, I believe, has got to have a spine of steel.''
Mr. Brown, a former two-term governor who is now the state attorney general, said he had thought ''long and hard about whether I should run for governor again.''
''I've been there; this is not an easy job,'' Mr. Brown said. ''And certainly I don't think it's a job that, because you know how to run a private business, you can run government.''
Neither candidate was shy about attacking the other, with Ms. Whitman describing Mr. Brown's connections to labor, which has given him sizable campaign contributions, as an impossible barrier to his making tough decisions on issues like public pensions and budget cuts.
''If your campaign is funded by those public employee unions, its going to be extraordinary difficult to negotiate,'' Ms. Whitman said. The unions, she said, would be there ''to collect their i.o.u.'s'' if Mr. Brown was elected.
Mr. Brown rejected the claim, and he suggested at one point that Ms. Whitman seemed to be merely repeating campaign talking points.
''I won't try to respond to that TV commercial I've seen so much of,'' he said.
Ms. Whitman has spent a record $119 million of her own money on the campaign, something she said -- repeating a point she has made on the campaign trail -- makes her independent.
Mr. Brown, who ran essentially uncontested for the Democratic nomination, has been relatively quiet in his campaigning, with few public events. But on Tuesday, it was Mr. Brown who was livelier and more animated, sprinkling his answers with salty language and drawing large laughs from the crowd assembled at the University of California, Davis.
One of those moments came when he was asked why California voters could be assured that he would not run for president again, something he did unsuccessfully in 1976, 1980 and 1992. Mr. Brown, who is 72, responded in one word.
''Age,'' he said, adding with a laugh: ''Hell, if I was younger you know I would be running again.''
Both candidates are trying make history.
Ms. Whitman would be the first woman to be governor of California. Mr. Brown, who led the state from 1975 to 1983, would be its first governor to serve three nonconsecutive terms. He would also be its oldest, something he joked about in reference to his eventually collecting a pension. ''I won't collect until I'm 76,'' he said. ''I'm the best pension buy California has ever seen.''
How the debate -- which was held at 6 p.m., when many California commuters are still on the roads -- will affect the race is an open question. A Field Poll released last week found Mr. Brown tied with Ms. Whitman at 41 percent. More striking, however, was the widening number of voters, about 18 percent, who said they had not yet made up their minds, an increase of 5 points from July.
While some of the questions at the hourlong debate addressed issues like the environment, and the death penalty -- a scheduled execution was stayed as the candidates talked -- it seemed likely that the economy would remain a focal point of the campaign.
Ms. Whitman kept her responses focused on her three-part plan for the state, which includes cutting regulations, raising the retirement age for public employees and reducing the size of government. Mr. Brown promised to call in all 120 state legislators to meet and fix the budget.
''I don't care if it takes 200 hours, 500 hours,'' he said, adding that while he had worked on eight budgets in his previous terms, he had never seen anything ''like this mess.''

HEADLINE: Key Races in Ohio Test Central Arguments of Midterms

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and DALIA SUSSMAN; Reporting was contributed by Marjorie Connelly, Marina Stefan, Megan Thee-Brenan and Ben Werschkul.

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Beverly Milum lost her job as a real estate agent and her house fell into foreclosure, and she has seen few signs that Democrats are delivering on their pledge to create jobs. She was ready to vote Republican at the top of her ballot, but now is uncertain.
''Economically, for me personally, it's terrible. I know a lot of people who are out of work,'' said Ms. Milum, 54, sitting on the back porch of the home that she is fighting to keep. ''But do I put my vote in someone I don't trust?'' 
Five weeks before the midterm elections, as Republicans seek to ride a wave of disapproval over the direction of the country, two key races in Ohio offer a window into the opportunities and quandaries facing both parties as voters narrow their choices in a climate of dire economic anxiety.
As Democrats struggle in governor's races across the Midwest, where states have been battered by unemployment and budget shortfalls, Gov. Ted Strickland is essentially tied among likely voters with his Republican challenger, John Kasich, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll in Ohio.
But it is a far different picture in a race for an open United States Senate seat. Rob Portman, a former Republican congressman who served as trade representative and budget director in the George W. Bush administration, holds an 11-point lead among likely voters over Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, his Democratic opponent. Mr. Fisher has had trouble raising money, and his attempts to criticize Mr. Portman on trade and other issues do not appear to have broken through.
Ohio has a reputation as perhaps the nation's leading political battleground, a bellwether that is testing the central arguments of the midterm campaign.
Two-thirds of those surveyed said their community had lost jobs in the last two years, and 70 percent said they expected the situation would either remain the same or get worse over the next year. Yet among likely voters who say Mr. Strickland has not made progress improving Ohio's economy, more than a quarter are supporting him anyway.
Mr. Strickland has hammered Mr. Kasich, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee who worked for the investment firm Lehman Brothers, for his ties to Wall Street. It is that message that raised doubts for Ms. Milum, a poll participant who said the only thing holding her back from supporting Mr. Kasich was that he has declined to say how much money he made at Lehman, which collapsed in the financial crisis of two years ago.
''I think Strickland is a good man, but he's not getting it done,'' Ms. Milum said in a follow-up interview on Monday. ''I like what Kasich has to say, but unless he addresses the Lehman Brothers fiasco for me, I feel that he has something to hide.''
The telephone poll was conducted Thursday through Monday with 1,114 adults, including 973 registered voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for both groups.
The fight for control of Congress is also playing out in Ohio, with Republicans aggressively challenging Democratic incumbents in at least six districts. The poll did not ask about individual Congressional seats, but 43 percent of likely voters said they would support their Republican candidate, while 39 percent would support the Democrat.
In 2006, when Republicans lost control of Congress, Democrats held an 18-point advantage on the same question in a New York Times/CBS News poll of Ohio voters in mid-October. The disapproval rating of Congress is 75 percent, compared with 70 percent nationally, which is 10 percentage points higher than it was four years ago in Ohio.
''We are going in the wrong direction as far as our nation is concerned,'' said Isaac Shupe, a Republican and retired pastor in Columbus who was surveyed in the poll. ''I'm more enthusiastic about getting control of government than I have been for years.''
Two years after President Obama carried Ohio, following back-to-back victories by Mr. Bush, a majority of voters said they were disappointed with Mr. Obama's presidency, including more than 6 in 10 independents and more than a quarter of all Democrats.
But when asked who is most to blame for the country's economic condition, nearly half of Ohioans blame the Bush administration or Wall Street, while only 9 percent blame Mr. Obama.
A majority of Ohioans see no benefits from Washington's response to the economy. Most do not think that Mr. Obama's economic programs have helped them personally or that the government's stimulus package has improved the state's economy.
More than 4 in 10 people say that their family's financial situation has worsened in the last two years. Only 11 percent of those surveyed said the financial situation of their household is improving. Fifty-six percent said they did not believe the lost jobs would ever come back.
''I don't think the lack of progress is Strickland's fault so much as the general trend of the economy as a whole,'' said Sarah York, 63, an independent voter and retired nursing aide from Franklin. ''He has brought some jobs back to Ohio.''
The economy and unemployment are overwhelmingly considered the most important problems facing the state -- 8 in 10 Ohioans say so, compared with 6 in 10 Americans who said they were the top national problems in a recent Times/CBS News poll. About one in four people surveyed in Ohio said the recession had been a hardship on their family and caused major life changes, while another 46 percent said it had been difficult.
The state's poor economy has dogged Mr. Strickland, with several polls showing him trailing Mr. Kasich. While nearly half of Ohioans said they disapproved of Mr. Strickland's performance as governor, fewer than one in four voters believe Mr. Kasich has a plan for creating jobs.
Both sides have waged aggressive television advertising campaigns, but the poll found that over half of voters did not have an opinion of Mr. Kasich, while about a third did not have an opinion of their current governor.
